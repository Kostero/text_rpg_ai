8 . You enter a cylindrical capsule, about twenty metres long and about 3 metres in diameter. Once your eyes get used to the darkness you see lots of people asleep strapped to bunks. You do not dare to make any noise. Sleeping quarters You are in what is clearly the crew's sleeping quarters. There must be at least ten people sleeping here. A hatchway leads further to the north, but you dare not go any further. You don't know how to answer the awkward questions they will ask if they find you. You don't really know why you are here. Have you taken the body of someone here, will they recognise you as one of their own? you don't know. Sometimes when you are teleported somewhere you are given your own body, sometimes you take over someone elses. Whatever happens, it's not the body you had in the last scene, you worked this out from the fact that your legs are not broken, your ribs are rib-like, your face has not been mangled and you have air in your lungs.

9 . Please, give it some more thought, will you? Don't do it. Thrappy says, "I like when you come here." 
3 . Catwalk Over Certain Death You find yourself on a rickety, metal catwalk high above a vat of novecilline. Fumes waft up from the glowing, green liquid below. Thrappy's room is behind you and Nova's lab, you recall, is through the doorway to the north. Interestingly enough, there's no giant robot or pack of rabid dingoes barring your passage. Could this be... a trap?

Then, after an awkward pause he adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his forehead. 'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the forest. . At a fork in the path I'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest. 
. I can't go in that direction, but I can move west. Uh-oh - what's that? I could have sworn I saw a pair of big, yellow eyes staring at me through the leaves...

 You cut the wires. White sparks light up the room. Smoke wisps out. Alarms sound. You continue hacking the wires. A commotion sounds behind you. Some people float behind you in disbelief. They are trying to control you now, but they are too late. The ship will never reach mars. You can feel your hands being tied behind your back. "Who the fuck are you?" You don't reply. You don't know the answer. "What have you done?" You don't reply. "Why have you done this?" You don't reply. "Throw him outside." That is, you think more of a threat than it at first sounds. You feel rough hands pushing you. You struggle, but a blow to the head renders you unconscious. Your head spins, you realise with relief that you are not in the void of space, perhaps you are in a temporary prison. Small room. 
 . You read the note: You must destroy this research station's biolabs. They would otherwise be responsible for creating the MN390 virus that would otherwise decimate the earths population. This virus must have been the one that was onboard the Mars24. You must therefore have travelled back in time a year or so. Something you remember strikes an off chord. You are sure that that cannot be true, but you can't put your finger on what. Who sent the note? Whoever sent you here you imagine. No way of telling. The handwriting is perfect.

It is a good thing the contents of this cup have been drunk already although you can still make out the scent of a freshly poured cup of Joe. An enormous spoon, by comparison to your newly found size, rests against the rim and extends down to the bottom of the cup.

Old Winery This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east. You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here. As you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?

You follow a corridor of black mist into a black walled spherical room. As you enter, a huge and horrible face materializes out of the mist. "What brings you here to trouble my imprisonment, wanderer?" it asks. Hearing no immediate answer, it studies you for a moment. "Perhaps you may be of some use to me in gaining my freedom from this place. Return to your foolish quest! I shall not destroy you this time. Mayhap you will repay this favor in kind someday." The face vanishes and the mist begins to swirl. When it clears you are returned to the world of life. Inside the Barrow You are inside an ancient barrow hidden deep within a dark forest. The barrow opens into a narrow tunnel at its southern end. You can see a faint glow at the far end. There is a lamp here.
