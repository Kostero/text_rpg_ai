8 . You enter a cylindrical capsule, about twenty metres long and about 3 metres in diameter. Once your eyes get used to the darkness you see lots of people asleep strapped to bunks. You do not dare to make any noise. Sleeping quarters You are in what is clearly the crew's sleeping quarters. There must be at least ten people sleeping here. A hatchway leads further to the north, but you dare not go any further. You don't know how to answer the awkward questions they will ask if they find you. You don't really know why you are here. Have you taken the body of someone here, will they recognise you as one of their own? you don't know. Sometimes when you are teleported somewhere you are given your own body, sometimes you take over someone elses. Whatever happens, it's not the body you had in the last scene, you worked this out from the fact that your legs are not broken, your ribs are rib-like, your face has not been mangled and you have air in your lungs.

9 . Please, give it some more thought, will you? Don't do it. Thrappy says, "I like when you come here." 
3 . Catwalk Over Certain Death You find yourself on a rickety, metal catwalk high above a vat of novecilline. Fumes waft up from the glowing, green liquid below. Thrappy's room is behind you and Nova's lab, you recall, is through the doorway to the north. Interestingly enough, there's no giant robot or pack of rabid dingoes barring your passage. Could this be... a trap?

Then, after an awkward pause he adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his forehead. 'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the forest. . At a fork in the path I'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest. 
. I can't go in that direction, but I can move west. Uh-oh - what's that? I could have sworn I saw a pair of big, yellow eyes staring at me through the leaves...

You feel rough hands pushing you. You struggle, but a blow to the head renders you unconscious. Your head spins, you realise with relief that you are not in the void of space, perhaps you are in a temporary prison. Small room.

This virus must have been the one that was onboard the Mars24. You must therefore have travelled back in time a year or so. Something you remember strikes an off chord.

It is a good thing the contents of this cup have been drunk already although you can still make out the scent of a freshly poured cup of Joe. An enormous spoon, by comparison to your newly found size, rests against the rim and extends down to the bottom of the cup. An enormous spoon, by comparison to your newly found size, rests against the rim and extends down to the bottom of the cup. What confounded science has brewed the pot of coffee likely just finished by a diner patron? You begin to realize the enormity of the void and the vast potential it stores. Are you still in control of it?
