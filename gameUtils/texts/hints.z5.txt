10085: Nothing to do!
10120: o. You have won
10220: It is now pitch dark in here!
10247: I beg your pardon?
10311: Sorry, that can't be corrected.
10340: Think nothing of it.
10393: As good-looking as ever.
10425: You can hardly repeat that.
10450: You can't begin with a comma.
10564: I didn't understand that number.
10593: You can't see any such thing.
10629: You aren't holding that!
10671: I'm not sure what "
10723: That's not a verb I recognise.
10762: You can't see "
10870: Nothing to do!
10887: There are none at all available!
11797: Please answer yes or no.
11823: Are you sure you want to quit?
11868: Failed.
11888: Restore failed.
11905: Ok.
11923: Save failed.
11938: Ok.
11982: Transcripting is already on.
12048: Transcripting is already off.
12106: Score notification on.
12127: Score notification off.
12150: You have visited:
12178: Objects you have handled:
12203: None.
12589: You are carrying nothing.
12638: Taken.
12649: You are always self-possessed.
13182: Dropped.
13292: Removed.
13431: You lack the dexterity.
13512: Done.
13778: Done.
13989: Wrahn seem interested.
14570: You can't go that way.
15130: But it's dark.
15147: You find nothing of interest.
15183: But it's dark.
15274: You find nothing of interest.
16402: . Not bad.
16420: That was a rhetorical question.
16474: That seems unnecessary.
16497: Keep your mind on the game.
16522: What a good idea.
16541: You smell nothing unexpected.
16568: You hear nothing unexpected.
16593: You taste nothing unexpected.
16628: Keep your hands to yourself!
16653: You feel nothing unexpected.
16678: If you think that'll help.
16787: Oh, don't apologise.
16817: Quite.
16886: You achieve nothing by this.
16974: You wave, feeling foolish.
17124: You are unable to.
17143: Nothing obvious happens.
17193: That's not a direction.
17216: Not that way you can't.
17248: Keep your hands to yourself.
17273: You achieve nothing by this.
17306: Futile.
17335: You talk to yourself a while.
17362: This provokes no reaction.
17390: There is no reply.
17409: Nothing is on sale.
17428: Your singing is abominable.
17462: Time passes.
40491: After a slight detour ...
41748: Give him the beer.
41845: Unwrap the gouda.
41971: DUCK or JUMP ASIDE.
42000: BLINK or KICK THE DUST.
42097: STAND UP.
42146: That was easy.
42187: SOMERSAULT or KICK THE WALL.
42241: JEPOS, HELP will also work.
42452: WEEP will also do the trick.
43092: DANCE.
43394: Hop along, now.
43902: I'd do that.
44040: LOOK UNDER THE BED.
44201: Now GO WEST, young man.
47308: Score:
47316: Moves:
47324: Time:
47332: You can't go that way.
47624: Please give one of the answers above.
47652: [You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
47688: [Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
47728: "Oops" can only correct a single word.
47756: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
47788: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
47848: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
47892: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
47932: I didn't understand that sentence.
47992: You seem to have said too little!
48016: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
48052: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
48088: You excepted something not included anyway!
48120: You can only do that to something animate.
48152: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
48200: I didn't understand the way that finished.
48232: Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which exactly?
48384: Are you sure you want to restart?
48408: The game file has verified as intact.
48436: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupt.
48480: Attempt to begin transcript failed.
48508: Attempt to end transcript failed.
48532: You're carrying too many things already.
48564: You can't put something on top of itself.
48596: You can't put something inside itself.
48652: You can only get into something freestanding.
48684: But you aren't in anything at the moment.
48716: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
48756: is now in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gives long
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
48852: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).
48936: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
49112: This dangerous act would achieve little.
49140: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
49172: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
49204: Digging would achieve nothing here.
49232: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
49260: You would achieve nothing by this.
49284: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
49312: But there's no water here to carry.
49340: Real adventurers do not use such language.
49372: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
49400: There's not enough water to swim in.
49428: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
49456: That would be less than courteous.
49480: Is that the best you can think of?
49504: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
49544: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
49576: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
49764: Have you tried dialing room service?
49792: Okay, have you tried to vomit?
49816: I guess you'll have to try to make a cup of coffee then.
49856: You may or may not have noticed that, with all the components there are
to this coffeemaker, there's no pot or cup for coffee to run into. You'll need
to find something to catch the coffee.
49988: The whiskey bottle in your inventory ought to do it, but it needs to be
empty first.
50048: You can only get rid of the whiskey in the bathroom sink.
50088: Before pouring water into the coffeemaker, it needs to be open. Before
turning it on, you need to close it again.
50168: You really ought to replace that used filter with a new one.
50212: The old filter can only be dumped, once again, in the bathroom. There's
a box of new filters in the closet. You could try using the towel for a filter,
but frankly, I'd advise against it.
50348: Can't open the packet? Try biting it.
50376: Make sure you empty the packet into the filter rather than the basket,
or you'll make the coffeemaker overflow.
50456: Once you have a new filter in the basket and fresh grounds in the new
filter, just slide the basket into the coffeemaker.
50540: Not that simple? Have you examined the basket?
50576: You need to hold the handle, then line up the basket. It may take a few
tries, in your condition.
50648: Don't forget to put the bottle in the coffeemaker before you turn it on.
50700: Clean it up.
50712: With the towel.
50724: And don't dawdle.
50740: If you haven't ruined your filter, you can still make coffee. Hope it's
the right kind.
50804: Complete the sobering-up process, then we'll talk about it.
50848: Ride the elevator down to the lobby and go outside, of course.
50892: Oops, forgot about Ralph. Well, how about examining that glass door in
the vestibule?
50956: That was it.
50968: What now? Try examining the stars you see from the balcony.
51012: That's a weird one. Examine that.
51038: How do I sober up?
     How do I make coffee?
     What do I do about
the mess?
     How do I overcome my writer's block?
     How can I get some
fresh air?
51188: How do I sober up?
51204: How do I make coffee?
51220: What do I do about the mess?
51244: How do I overcome my writer's block?
51272: How can I get some fresh air?
51300: You're the author! Don't you know?
51328: When you run into names from your fantasy series, you can remember them.
51380: Important names to remember right now are Kyub, the House, Sephyr and
the Rebellion. Those might give you some idea of what to do.
51476: Exploring around a bit should also help.
51504: Oh, and go back to the cliff and examine the plain from time to time.
51556: Nothing you need to know about now.
51584: I'd make a map of them before I did anything else, if I were you.
51632: They're a five-room maze, and you have five objects ...
51676: You haven't got five objects? Haven't you looked in the cupboards?
51724: Oh, you didn't realize there were two antechambers? Well, there are.
51776: The fifth item is inside the sock.
51800: Drop a different item in each room and try all possible exits from that
room. You'll have a map in no time.
51876: Now let's talk about the fixtures. You noticed that you could put things
in them, right?
51940: And you noticed that putting an item in a fixture causes something to
happen in another room?
52004: The fixtures control the weather in the rooms they affect. For instance,
putting the sandbag in the fixture northwest of the left antechamber turns the
room east of the left antechamber into a flooded room.
52148: But the room the swizzle stick controls will only open if the stick is
in the correct fixture.
52212: One of the fixtures has a sun carved under it. Figure out which fixture
controls that room and put the swizzle stick in it.
52300: The other four fixtures need to be occupied as well.
52340: That's right, you can't take the objects from the cupboards outside the
House of Kyub.
52404: They'll be back in their proper cupboards once you return, however.
52452: I'd say you were sticking around too long.
52484: Don't say "wait" in the Frozen Room or Stormy Room.
52524: Alternatively, if you've been playing with the lodestone, see the
lodestone clues.
52584: If you've made a map, it shouldn't be a problem.
52620: Say you came to the Flooded Room by going east from Gray Room 1 (or
whatever you called it on your map), and your map tells you that you can return
to Gray Room 1 by going west. Go west.
52756: Which Gray Room did this use to be?
52784: All the exits from that Gray Room are still in place. Just go in the
opposite direction from the exit you want to take.
52868: Try dropping it on the floor and spinning it.
52900: Try turning it in various directions.
52928: The lodestone only works when inserted into one of the fixtures. Do
that, then, say, point it north.
53000: It attracts lightning.
53016: Don't go on unless you've gotten into the Balmy Room.
53056: You have a choice, as the inscription on Kyub's casket tells you: you
can block the army from getting here, or you can use the lightning to transport
the caskets to a hidden place.
53184: Then again, you could just destroy the army.
53216: But as the author of this story, you haven't decided yet whether the
army is good or bad.
53280: The army needs to ford the stream before it can reach the House Of Kyub.
53332: The stream is located roughly southeast of here.
53368: If you hit the bridge they're building, they can't cross.
53412: Point the lodestone southeast.
53436: And where in this maze of rooms is the Balmy Room located, in case you
want to try the other choice?
53508: Go outside the House and examine the weather.
53540: Point the lodestone northeast.
53564: Of course, in this case the army is still on its way here, so you need
to discover a way out before they show up.
53644: Don't go on unless you've been to the Balmy Room.
53684: You can destroy the army by using the lodestone.
53720: They're on the "southern plain." Point the lodestone south.
53764: Okay, maybe that was a tad hasty. See the lodestone clues.
53808: Sure, if your interpreter supports it. Type UNDO.
53848: You mean in the game? Actually, you can, but not right now.
53892: When you get to a location that has green lines of rock, you can use
them to return here and change your choice if you want to.
53980: Both "right" choices are equal in value for your education, however.
54032: Yes, once you've saved Kyub and Sephyr from the rebel invasion.
54080: There are two ways of doing that: consult the lodestone hints.
54124: A glittering necklace appears outside the House.
54160: Pick it up.
54172: You'll lose it immediately, but should you ever return to these parts,
you'll have it again.
54240: You'll also have something to type on your laptop back at the hotel.
54288: What am I supposed to do here?
     What are these lines of rock?
    
What's the deal with all these gray rooms?
     Hey! My possessions
disappeared!
     How come I keep getting killed by the weather?
     The
Flooded Room is a bit annoying!
     The Blustery Room is even more annoying!
 
   How exactly does the lodestone work?
     What can I do about the army?
    
Can I take my choice back?
     Is there a way out of this place?
54628: What am I supposed to do here?
54652: What are these lines of rock?
54676: What's the deal with all these gray rooms?
54708: Hey! My possessions disappeared!
54732: How come I keep getting killed by the weather?
54768: The Flooded Room is a bit annoying!
54796: The Blustery Room is even more annoying!
54828: How exactly does the lodestone work?
54856: What can I do about the army?
54880: Can I take my choice back?
54900: Is there a way out of this place?
54928: It's somebody's hotel room. Leave and go to your own!
54968: You can't? You can't do much here, can you?
55004: Except look at things.
55020: And read things. Read the letter.
55048: It's Ralph's room, and now you know a bit more about his point of view.
55100: Wait a few turns and you'll automatically be transported back to the
balcony on your floor.
55164: What's this about?
55204: What's this about?
55224: Did you read the letter he was writing?
55252: He wants to know how it feels to be a guest.
55284: Particularly, how it feels to have a minibar with beer in it.
55328: You have no idea.
55344: Neither do I.
55356: But we both might be able to come up with one a little later.
55400: You obviously want to return to RANS and accumulate more story ideas.
55452: But first you should deal with Ralph. Don't go on till you have.
55500: The minibar was helpful in the lobby. Perhaps it'll help with this
problem too.
55556: How do I get past Ralph?
     How do I cross the street?
     What now?
55628: How do I get past Ralph?
55648: How do I cross the street?
55668: What now?
55680: Am I surprised?
55880: If she's threatened by a single sword, HIT THE SWORD or PROTECT JEPOS.
55948: If it's several swords, only PROTECT JEPOS will be successful.
56004: Don't try to escape it by struggling. You'll only make it worse. But
why?
56060: Your enemies are holding onto the net by its edges and wrapping it
around you.
56116: And you're still bent over, so they have leverage.
56152: JUMP ONTO THE CART or PUSH JEPOS.
56192: SLIDE ON THE OIL or HIT THE OIL.
56232: BALANCE ON THE APPLES or FALL DOWN.
56276: ATTACK THE GRIM MAN to wear him down a bit, or SALUTE him.
56332: If he's waiting for you to speak, SPEAK TO HIM.
56376: SUMMON JEPOS.
56396: Well, use your imagination. There are a number of, shall we say, R-rated
alternatives.
56460: On the other hand, you could spend the time asking Jepos about things
that've caught your notice. Your score won't be affected either way.
56560: Once Kamendro and the Warrior show up, the best thing to do is WAIT and
listen to their entire conversation.
56640: You could try startling them so they leave the alley.
56680: But you don't want to make a lot of noise.
56712: You have in your possession something that wouldn't make much noise if
it fell. They've been discussing it, in fact.
56796: THROW THE NECKLACE.
56820: You want to pick up that pocket doorway, don't you?
56860: Unlike other games with portable exits, this one shouldn't be dropped.
56912: You either want to give it to Jepos or tell Jepos to enter it. Your
choice.
56968: But you need to be someplace quieter than the alley.
57004: Take the pocket doorway, then type OUT.
57036: You've got your hands on your knees and your head toward the pavement
...
57088: VOMIT.
57096: And the green ones are pulsating.
57120: Touch them or stand on them and you'll be transported back to the House
of Kyub, before the army builds its bridge.
57204: This is your chance to see what would've happened if you'd made the
other "correct" choice about the army.
57280: It won't affect your score, however.
57308: To return to the Red Game, touch or stand on the red lines.
57352: That's up to you.
57368: But let me point out, this will screw Jepos up for the rest of her life,
whereas you understand this is all just taking place in a book.
57464: The chivalrous thing would be to do it yourself. Feel chivalrous?
57512: Kill Kamendro in his sleep.
57532: Of course, it'd be nice if you had something to kill him with.
57576: Take Jepos's sword before entering the doorway.
57612: Then you need to find the evidence of his collusion with the Rebellion.
57664: It's behind the mirror. Pick it up, then drop it out the window.
58084: Help! I keep getting killed in the street battle!
58160: To prevent Jepos being stabbed:
58184: To escape the net:
58260: To survive the swordfight:
58356: What am I supposed to do in the alley?
58400: How does the pocket doorway work?
     What should my reaction to the
horrific spectacle be?
     Here's some of those lines of rock again!
     Who
should do the dirty deed?
     What should I do in Kamendro's quarters?
58584: How does the pocket doorway work?
58608: What should my reaction to the horrific spectacle be?
58648: Here's some of those lines of rock again!
58680: Who should do the dirty deed?
58704: What should I do in Kamendro's quarters?
58740: This is another peek into someone's life that might affect your progress
in the real world.
58804: Listen to the message attentively.
58830: What am I doing here?
58868: What am I doing here?
58888: The man on the answering machine was upset about the traffic just like
you are.
58944: He wished the street dancers were still performing in front of the
hotel.
58996: Maybe other people in the cars going by feel the same way.
59036: You can ask him things.
59056: You can smell him.
59072: You can check out his junk.
59092: Don't go on unless you've been to his humble abode.
59132: He lives in filth.
59148: Perhaps if he had something he could clean himself up with, he could
begin to put his life back together.
59220: But how likely is that? Anyway, it isn't your responsibility.
59268: Give him the towel. Even if you've turned it into an indescribable
object, it's bound to be cleaner than anything he possesses.
59360: Unfortunately, it's a hotel towel, and Ralph won't let you carry it out
the door.
59420: But you now have something you can hide it in.
59452: Take the duffel bag again. Nothing weird will happen this time, I
promise.
59508: Well, you're right.
59524: Return to the hotel.
59540: Ralph is sleepy, so you can now get a closer look at the plant.
59584: Go ahead and pick that up, bad boy.
59610: Okay, so how do I cross the street already?
     How can I interact with
the loathsome bum?
     Well, I know there's got to be another exit around here
somewhere!
59752: Okay, so how do I cross the street already?
59784: How can I interact with the loathsome bum?
59816: Well, I know there's got to be another exit around here somewhere!
59868: You seem to be on your way to market.
59896: Take a breather. Sit under it.
59920: Aren't you curious about that whispering?
59952: Then go ahead, listen to it or examine it.
59984: It's almost as if it had a mind of its own!
60016: It seemed to be whispering before.
60040: Try talking to it.
60056: You'll be able to open it only at the proper time.
60092: It's entirely up to you ...
60116: But your education has progressed far enough that you can now modify
events in a radical way.
60180: If you choose Peace, the rebellion will have already been defeated.
60228: If you choose War, it'll still be going on, but everyone will know what
they're fighting for.
60296: Because you're now mature enough to accept the consequences of your
actions?
60352: Because the lines of rock only work on the past, and there are no blue
lines in the Market Fair?
60420: Because you have a greater magic: SAVE and RESTORE.
60464: Only as a source of information.
60488: You can ask him for news of the rebellion, Jepos, Sephyr etc.
60536: His answers will differ depending on which version of the contest you're
in.
60592: You don't.
60604: And if you haven't found anyone (or anything) that might know, restore
and go find one.
60668: It's the blue book. Consult that topic.
60700: Wait your turn, then open the book. It'll put the words in your mouth.
60752: If you chose War, however, you don't deserve to win the contest. You'll
need to do a bit more to redeem yourself.
60836: Brass lantern? Which game are you playing?
60868: Okay, okay. Well, for right now, just take it.
60904: Well, you could look her over and talk with her a bit if you're not
sure.
60956: Her heart seems to be in the right place. What could be the harm?
61004: Where am I?
     What can I do with the oak tree?
     Why can't I open
this book?
     Which category should I sign up for?
     Why can't I change my
choice in this segment?
     Is Tringle important?
     How do I know what to
recite?
     What do I do with the brass lantern?
     Should I help the crone?
61256: Where am I?
61268: What can I do with the oak tree?
61292: Why can't I open this book?
61316: Which category should I sign up for?
61344: Why can't I change my choice in this segment?
