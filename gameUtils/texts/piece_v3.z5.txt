13106: Time:
13801: Csdba KpmTo repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not
"frog, again".
13884: You can hardly repeat that.
14214: You can't begin with a comma.
14277: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
14368: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
16242: I didn't understand that sentence.
16356: I didn't understand that number.
16433: You seem to have said too little!
16459: kfe    a.
I don't have that!
16492: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
16578: I'm not sure what "
16615: You excepted something not included anyway!
16655: I'd rather do that with something that might do it back.
16703: Call me a simpleton, but that's not a verb I recognise.
16842: I didn't understand the way that finished.
16965: There are none at all available!
19896: Sorry, you can only have one item here.  Which one exactly?
28954: At the moment, "it"
29026: and "me" means
29053: exn** Player objects must have "number" prop **
33722: I feel the limitations of my existance shatter as in the distance (or in
some sense of what could be called distance) a cyclic sound grows ever less
frequent, until it fades completely.

I think we made it! The chamber has gone
- there's only a faint glow to remind me I'm still around. Stinky is here too,
she's nibbling my ankle. Hey - stop that! Good girl.

Listen -  I've got an
idea! You should delete 'Piece of Mind' when I've gone - heck, we can't give
the Meko-mind another chance to gain the input it needs.

Well, I guess that's
it. It was nice meeting you and all - sorry to have dragged you into this, but
I do appreciate your help. Hey - Stinky! Don't go down there - you don't
know...aw, damn - I'm gonna have to go after her. See ya round, buddy - and
thanks again. Here Stinky, stinkystinkystinky.
35045: M.
39900: Nothing to do!
39918: I have died - but I get the feeling I'm still stuck here, trapped,
without control over my own destiny. Please, try again.
40015: We have won! Yeeeeeeeeeeeha!!
40190: [Your interpreter does not provide "undo".  Sorry!]
40290: Please give one of the answers above.
40352: I beg your pardon?
40370: ehn
[You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
40414: ehn
[Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
40490: Sorry, that's too stuffed to be corrected.
40528: Think nothing of it.
40550: "Oops" can only correct a single word.
40621: a.
Please answer yes or no.
40645: Are you sure you want to quit?

40778: Save failed.
40789: Ok.

41150: None.
41204: I've got nothing on me.
41245: Taken.
41259: I'm already in possesion of myself.
41393: Too late - I've already got it.
41491: That isn't available right now - take a number and wait in line.
41658: I've got my hands full right now.
41758: I would if I could, but I don't have that.
41825: Dropped.
41844: But it's shut!
41864: But it isn't there now.
41885: Removed.
41970: Putting something on top of itself is rather beyond my abilites.
42042: would achieve nothing. So don't do it again!
42082: I lack the dexterity to perform that otherwise very practical action.
42198: Done.
42240: I need to be holding it before I can put it into something else.
42292: That's not a thing to put things in.
42326: Alas, woe is me - it's closed.
42388: I can't put something inside itself. I'm just not that clever.
42502: Done like a chicken in a microwave.
42564: That isn't in my possession right this minute.
42599: First pick that up.
42895: That's not a scene I think I could get into.
42971: I can only get into something on the floor.
43085: But I'm not on anything at the moment.
43194: And which direction might that happen to be in?
43291: I can't go that way. It's not the done thing.
43516: OK - I'll be brief.
43540: OK - you don't need to give me much excuse to talk more.
43588: My lips are zipped.
43807: It's black - if that's any help.
43839: Wow - it's beautiful, in its own special and fundamentally uninteresting
way.
43909: But it's dark.
43922: I have always believed that looking under things is the surest route to
hell.
43987: But it's dark.
44005: There is nothing interesting there at all.
44087: Nothing. Squat. Zip.
44173: It is as empty as a yogi's mind.
44249: Can't unlock that! It's not even lockable.
44317: That doesn't seem to fit the lock.
44371: That doesn't seem to be lockable - I could be wrong, but I doubt it.
44487: That doesn't seem to fit the lock.
44541: Um - there doesn't appear to be a switch.
44579: That's already on.
44625: There's not switch on it.
44651: That's already off.
44697: That's not something I could ever hope to open.
44739: It seems to be locked.
44763: It's already open.
44838: Hnabsolutely nothing.
44885: That's not something I can close.
44917: It's already closed.
44963: I'm not wearing that.
45011: I can't wear that! It's so last week.
45047: I'm not holding that!
45071: I'm already wearing it, remember.!
45127: I'm not hungry in the slightest.
45168: Not bad.
45184: I agree.
45198: Yeah - start a fire, burn the place down - burn burn BURN. Nah.
45256: I get down on my knees and pray like a demon. I hear a voice in my head
whispering about how silly I look.
45338: I'm not asleep.
45358: Already awake.
45376: My idea of free love doesn't quite go that far.
45418: It hurts, it hurts.
45470: Aint nothing worth hearing in here.
45537: With you watching? I don't think so.
45596: I feel nothing surprising.
45622: Yeah, groovy man - get on with it.
45684: Ok, hup two, hup two, oh, sod this cardiovascular nonsense.
45738: I don't think it's worth the effort.
45770: ehn
There's nothing suitable to drink here. I'd know.
45816: But there's no water here to carry.
45850: I bet you are.
45868: Yeah - DIY new wave interactive fiction.
45906: My grandmother knows worse words.
45938: I'll wait 'till somebody else throws the first punch, if it's all the
same to you.
46004: There's not enough water to swim in.
46038: I'd rather swing my cat.
46064: PHWEEEEEE - well that did a lot.
46100: I can think of several things I'd rather do.
46140: Game, set, match etc. Pointless..
46174: Don't want to.
46306: It's immovable. Or I'm not irresistable.
46346: I can't.
46362: I'm not that rude.
46379: Nothing obvious happens. Perhaps, somewhere, (a recycled fantasy-humour
book perhaps) a butterfly flapped its wing with a bit more effort, changed
course slightly, and brought down a minor civilisation. Or perhaps not.
46546: Push off.
46562: That's not a direction.
46583: Not that way.
46663: Might be fun, but it's probably criminal.
46706: I can't be bothered.
46725: No - I might make a mess..
46758: Hi - how am I?
46773: This provokes no reaction.
46829: Nothing is on sale. Despite what evangelical marketeers tell you.
46883: I grunt away to some old tune or another, wondering if I should quit my
day job.
46947: I don't want to.
46967: Dum de dum.
46983: I'm not sure I'm not dreaming now..
47310: Nah, I don't think I'll bother. I've done it before and it wasn't worth
it.
47374: Woah - it's just so uninteresting behind there, it's amazing.
47845: wu>. 

You could even get the puppet to <enter> an object if humanly

Being

48171: for the 1996 Interactive Fiction contest. This is the third version -
which has cleared up a lot a spelling mistakes, and niggly little problems
(never type under the influence, kiddies).

It is the first program I've
written with over 20 lines of code, so there's bound to be a few things that go
a bit weird, however, as far as I know, most of it does what it's supposed to.
50160: RESS BUTTON
CUT WEB
LOOK AT FACE
LOOK BEHIND EYES
and that's all I'm
saying at this point. It's up to you.
50338: A poor choice.
50355: icmq  ohn
I couldn't if I wanted to - as I'm am too far away from it at
the moment. You'll have to move me closer.
50447: Which direction is that in? Sorry to be so pedantic, but, for some
reason, when I try to make value judgements like that, my mind goes all cloudy,
like a fishbowl in need of new water.
50591: The beam prevented me from moving - It's like my brain was cut off from
my body.
50661: Yeah, I tried that, but it didn't work - I was being led from one event
to the next without control of my actions.
50771: A voice spoke - a message in my head! It welcomed me!
50827: A beam of light broke through the mist, striking me square on the
forehead. I felt as if somebody had unplugged me, as if all my stored energy
was being sucked out of me, leaking from a broken circuit.
50978: As my eyes began to close, I saw a silvery figure emerge from the mist,
placing something between myself and the beam. Reflecting against the
obstruction, it shot back into the swirling smoke. With a jolt I came to my
senses, only to be violently pushed to one side by the figure. A split second
later there was a gigantic explosion in the space I previously
inhabited



















And then I ended up here, back in my bed. Only now
I can't seem to move a muscle. I've been waiting for something, heck, anything
to happen - just wondering what the hell is going on.
51430: I'm at one side of my rather large bedroom. It is, by rights, a lounge -
but I sleep here to keep the rent cheap. The queen sized double bed takes a
dominant position, mostly because it's the only comfortable thing to sit on. A
few tatty posters line the walls and to the northeast is a window
51698: Xmwith drawn curtains.
51879: I'd have to get up before I could reach that.
51933: My GOD! I can move again - I just got up!!! All you have to do is tell
me, and it happens. That is sooo freaky. I guess I'm in your hands now - your
wish is my command and all that jazz. Listen, I don't want to be a burden, so I
think we should find a way out of this predicament as soon as humanly possible.
52180: I peer under the bed. Hey, there's something right at the back. Reaching
in I fumble around and find...a piece of a jigsaw, grey like the underside of a
fish. So that's where the sodding thing went, no wonder I never finished it. I
throw it away in disgust, resolving not to waste time looking under things
again.
52411: I've always believed that looking under things is the surest route to
hell.
52475: That's across the room to the north-east. A tad too far to stretch, if
you catch my drift.
52547: That's across the room to the north-east. A tad too far to stretch, if
you catch my drift.
52623: Alas, the mood to redecorate is not upon me, but then, it rarely is.
52679: There is a previously unnoticed and unnoteworthy piece of wall.
52730: A bottle of Uncle Sebastian's finest Rose Wine - made from real rose
petals. He can make wine from anything, the drunken old sot. It reminds me of
the time I got so smashed I, um, oh. Whatever, it's all a bit of a haze. It was
pretty disgusting anyway.
52928: I wonder if this bottle is half empty or half full of Uncle Sebby's
concoction.
52998: I don't know much about chemistry - but the wine has transmuted into a
pretty evil looking brew. It's bubbling like a rabid baby and sure doesn't
smell like rose petals any more.
53241: yxn
I take a sip of wine - mmm, that's nice wine. Tastes like a walk in
the forest with a large axe. I think I'll take another. Just a little one.
Still plenty left.
53384: I pour out the wine. What a waste of Uncle Seb's Finest. I'm sure it
would have come in handy sooner or later. Alcohol always does.
53493: The alien enzyme reaches out a tentacle and dips it in the puddle.
Extracting it again, it shakes the appendage and says blurple or something.
53602: Do you mean take the bottle or drink the wine? Or something else?
53746: I pour the strange brew onto the floor. It makes a dark stain, and
smells like a gerbil's innards, making it somewhat more appetising than some of
Uncle Seb's other brands.
53888: The enzyme appears interested and oozes out tendrils in 	the direction
of the puddle. I watch as the alien's internal bubbles reverse, sucking all the
liquid deep inside itself - where it disappears.

The enzyme's surface area
expands and the bubbles again flow outwards. Hmm, that's rather a lot of foul
smelling chemical for one wee alien. Eventually the enzyme forms a shallow
bubbling pool. I think it might have had a bit too much at once.
54218: I sing a little song -

"Wardobe, wardrobe, an ode I sing to thee
You're
such a polished specimen, high in my top three
favourite types of furniture, a
box with a door
is all that you appear to be, and yet, you're so much more."
54412: There are those who believe that walking into closed wardrobes is a
piece of cake. I can't look that type in the eye, the physical repercussions of
their actions are just too horrific.
54553: It's a fairly voluminous wardrobe. I could probably enter it and get a
better look.
54618: Inside the wardrobe now. There's not a huge amount of room for the likes
of me, most of the space being taken up by
54786: I sing a little song -

"A black linen suit and a furry coat
One had a
tailor, the other had a throat
One did the cutting, the other one was cut
But
only one was paid for it - and that's a largish 'but'".
54942: I push my way past the fur coats, and find more fur coats. I keep on
pushing, past more fur coats than could be supported by one habitat. Small
fluffy genocide I'd say. After a while, the fur becomes harsh and scratchy and
I'm brushing up against bits of wood. I think one more push should do it.
55191: I think it would look better on me than my underwear, which is all I'm
currently wearing.
55351: There's too many of them to hold at once, so I don't think I'll bother -
I'd never be able to decide which one I like best, anyway. Decisions never were
my strong point.
55481: Yeah, It'd look real good. Way stylish. No thanks.
55538: This is a large wooden room - with shelves filled with dusty books
lining most walls. It reminds me of an old style headmaster's study - what with
the imposing desk at the far end, buried in the paper effluvium of an
institutional body. I have truly fond memories of such places, the dusty smell
and the almost tangible air of authority warms my posterior with a nostalgic
glow. 

There are several doors to the north, all locked with padlocks the size
of my head.
55866: Listen - there's no way I'm staying here wearing just my underwear. I've
gotta go. As I can't control the rest of my body, I crawl out with my lips.
Potential humiliation is a tremendous energiser.
56034: I whisper a little song to a sweet four chord turnaround -

"If you copy
anything, make sure you copy right
And if you steal ideas - then do it out of
sight
1001 lawyers are living for the day
that someone sees you at it - so they
can make you pay."
56434: The man looks back down at his papers. Totally unable to avoid reading
the blatantly inverted title, I can't help but notice that it's a report on a
recent outbreak of lawless and morally indefensible photocopying. Bet that
keeps him up nights.
56615: Pushing his spectacles up the bridge of his nose, the balding man looks
at me questioningly. 

"Didn't you hear me? I said this area is (C)opyright!.
We can't have people traversing the imagined realms of great creative minds
willy nilly, as if they owned the place. I don't care how many times you read
the book, or saw the movie, or indeed thrilled to the television series. It's
legally somebody else's, despite its obvious prominence in your psyche."
56950: With a look of quiet exasperation, the balding man shrugs his shoulders.
Dandruff 		glints in the dim light.

"Oh, all right then - stick around. It's
not as if I have any *work* to do or anything."
57128: I don't want to leave without the results of my copyright request. Isn't
it exciting? That's a rhetorical question.
57225: I run my hand over the stone, noticing its warmth.
57284: When I touch the symbol, a voice speaks in my mind.
57330: Brain Scan Complete - Contents Registered - Security Rating 5'.
57384: This must be one of the fabled +5 stones of copy protection that I've
heard absolutely nothing about, but I've always thought would be a good idea.
57503: I take the invisible key out of my pocket and try to unlock some of the
doors. When the invisible key fails to unlock any of the doors, owing primarily
to its non-existence, I put it back and whistle nonchalantly like a madman.
57667: That's not a key. It's not even like a key. Not even a tiny bit.
57722: There is a balding, bespectacled man sitting at the far end of the desk.
He is
57789: oxnchewing on the end of a pencil that has worn down to its last inch.
Nervous tension can be a truly destructive force.
57953: nxnrubbing at his eyes behind his glasses. When he finishes, they look
even redder and more watery than before.
58089: playing with his lower lip and the sharpened end of his pencil. He
accidentally jabs himself in gum, says "Ow!" and then looks at me to see if I
noticed. I stare at a nearby shelf.
58222: There is a rattling of keys to the north, and the balding, bespectacled
man returns, locking the door behind him. He passes me a mysterious artifact of
awesome power, shakes me by the hand, then sits down and starts working once
more.
58401: uhn
He stands his ground and I can't even lift his foot off the floor.
He says something about getting a lot of this kind of thing in the industry.
58715: offins. Just wait one moment while I go and fill in some forms."

Rising
from his desk, he turns and unlocks one of the doors behind him. He opens it
and disappears, closing the door after him. I hear the sound of a key turning.
Good ears, huh?
59013: "I hope you're not playing any (c)opyrighted songs on that thing!"
59072: "I never drink on the job - you want the Trademark department."
59128: "Good heavens - the idea for that book was stolen. Flagrant (c)opyright
violation. I'd best fill in some forms this minute."
59252: "That must be one of the least interesting things anyone has ever shown
me. Go away, you horrible little person."
59342: "Ah yes - the remotely controlling device. It emits a beam of infra-red
light - but I'm afraid it's already got a copyright. Better luck next time."
59460: "Mesh! MESH! I'm up to my eyeballs in paperwork, and you show me a
mesh?"
59526: "It's the very latest thing. Touch sensitive, apparently. I wouldn't
lose it, if I were you. I'd lend you an instruction manual for it, but I don't
happen to have one. No matter, I'm sure you can figure it out yourself."
59697: The man stares at you for a second - his eyes magnified by his
spectacles. "Is that right?", he asks.
59791: "Copyright is one of the most important inventions of this millennia. If
it wasn't for copyright, the world would be inundated with despicably low
quality rip-offs of greater works. Imagine that - you wouldn't know if what
you're reading was what it said it was - or something completely different!!!."
60019: The man gives me a stern look. 

"Not so loud, there could be lawyers
around!."
60091: ehn
"Apparently there are some rapscallions around who delight in the
illegitimate replication of already existing works - many of which are banned
(for all the right reasons, of course). This black marketeering sneers in the
face of honest men, spitting upon the due process of law and its accompanying
order. Thankfully, the authorities are fully aware of the situation and are
taking steps to bring the miscreants to justice."
60406: "It's the very latest thing. Touch sensitive, apparently. I wouldn't
lose it, if I were you. I'd lend you an instruction manual for it, but I don't
happen to have one. No matter, I'm sure you can figure it out yourself."
60582: "Oh, yes. Secret plans? Why I'll bet they're to let some evil entity
take over the universe! Do grow up, young whippersnapper."
60684: Axn
"What's that? Let me see."
60720: "I hope you're not playing any (c)opyrighted songs on that thing!"
60782: "I never drink on the job - you want the Trademark department."
60838: "Good heavens - the idea for that book was stolen. Flagrant (c)opyright
violation. I'd best fill in some forms this minute."
60940: "That must be one of the least interesting things anywhere. Go away, you
horrible little person."
61020: yhn
"Ah yes - the remotely controlling device. It emits a beam of
infra-red light, you know - but I'm afraid it's already got a copyright. Better
luck next time."
61148: "Mesh! MESH! I'm up to my eyeballs in paperwork, and you think I care
about a mesh?"
61221: What about it?
61240: No -  I'm not going to - they split in half and make more bureaucrats.
61298: I'd rather kiss you.
61327: There's nothing there that interests me in the slightest.
61374: This desk is covered by more papers than a royal divorce. Most of them
have titles like 'The Inexorable Processes of Digital Reproduction' and
'Royalties for Fun and Profit'.
61516: On top of one the piles is an interesting stack of papers, ostensibly
about photocopying crimes.
61597: There's no drawers to put anything in the desk, just a surface to put
things on. I guess the poor guy who works here just has to watch the piles of
paper on top grow higher, without being able to seek psychological relief by
throwing the things into a darkened space where they can be safely ignored.
Must take a special kind of guy!
61901: Looking through the papers I notice that underneath the impressive
officialese of the cover page is a photocopied document. How duplicitous.
62007: You know, I could both open it and examine it by reading it - you don't
have to spell things out quite that much!
62103: The balding, bespectacled man clamps his hand down on them, muttering
something about the extreme confidentiality of the papers. The speed with which
he defends his manuscript tells me he has read the official secrets act with
one hand on his gun.
62361: Oh, my goodness. No innocent tract concerning the apprehension of
photocopy convention violators this! It's really secret and dastardly plans to
... to ... oh, damn - the bit after secret and dastardly plans is in code.
62520: I don't have them - so I can't really read them.
62562: I'm standing beside my window. I often take breaks here, looking out
onto the rest of the world and strumming my guitar. I suppose I should learn
some songs someday.
62688: Out of the window I can see a vast black background. Suspended in the
centre is a sun, which appears to be permanently in eclipse.
62786: The curtains are currently closed.
62830: I make up a small song, whilst accompanying myself -

"Looking from my
window, out onto the universe
Wondering if the primal song got practiced or was
unrehearsed
Grooving to the music of the seven crystal spheres
Contemplating
the inner fridge and its several undrunk beers."
63030: These ratty curtains were a present from my mother. They keep out no
light whatsoever. Thanks, Mum. They are currently
63156: I reach up and open the curtains...
63220: Instead of the Indoor Cricket centre across the street, there's stark
blackness stretching out as far as I can discern. Hanging suspended in the inky
void is a sun, or rather its halo, as it appears to be in eclipse. You don't
see this kind of thing every day without spending far more on pharmaceuticals
than my budget permits.
63535: What do you think this is, the sixties?
63575: Spectacular - a central darkness surrounded by a ring of fire. If the
landlord could see it, he'd probably charge more for the room.
63670: That, being behind the curtain, is impossible to see.
63743: Outside the peeling paint of the windowsill is suspended a sun in a
state of eclipse.
63865: As soon as I open the window, I find my arm sucked into a vacuum. Unable
to retrieve it as the available atmosphere is sucked away, the lack of
sufficient oxygen to continue breathing quickly becomes a problem. Not to
mention the lack of air pressure. I breathlessly explode. What a mess!
64523: If this was the kind of desk that contained things, I would be more than
happy to oblige. But, alas, it is only the kind of desk that things sit on, so
I cannot fulfil your command.
64756: Aww - It's kind of shite. You don't really want to see it do you?
64831: Man, amateur poetry is much too embarrassingly bad to read, wouldn't you
agree?
64912: You really want to?
64949: OK - here it is...
64984: Poem - By Me 		

If all there are around me  		
are shades of grey,
interpreted, 		
then there is no either/or 		
no on or off 		
no symbols that
contain 		
more meaning than themselves 		
and yet the middle is excluded
		
there is no ground that lies between, 		
a thousand static pictures
		
staring, tell me so each day 		
and if they move, they move the same 		
mine
to keep 		
a perfect image 		
in a frozen mirror.

(c) 1996 		



See, I told
you it wasn't very good.
65402: was state of the art for about two minutes after I bought it. Now, what
with tumbling processor prices and the inexorable march of technology it's
something of an instant classic. Love or leave 'em, by the end of the day I can
hardly bring myself to touch the screen.
65596: Currently there is a weird flowing pattern being displayed.
65728: My mail program informs me with a friendly blinking light (that could
possibly induce epileptic seizures) I have new mail.
65823: It's already on. I never turn it off, so don't even think about it.
65881: I never turn it off. What if inspiration should strike? My short-term
memory isn't good enough to remember things that long.
65972: No - I don't think I'll bother fiddling with it - it brings back too
many unhappy memories of the office.
66173: The mail reads as follows: 

Hey there - I think I found the Meko-mind's
weak point! I can't tell you what it is, because it's a bit technical and I
don't want to confuse you. But he's running some software in an endless loop
that I managed to disable - and I think it has something to do with you. Don't
thank me, I owe you one.
    -Jeff Steele

What a pretentious git!!
66450: You're cheating! - Stop it!
66488: I dunno what it is - somebody else must have set it. I wonder who!
66539: I type in my cleverly acquired password and the screen comes up with the
usual GUI.
66610: Woah - that's odd - there's some newly arrived e-mail - but my modem
isn't even here! Creepy, huh?
66691: yxm
Let's see - there's a whole lot of stuff on the screen that seems
absolutely ordinary. Man, that sucks - there must be some reason some ratbag
tried to deny me access.
66826: But wait - what's that? Mail? But my modem isn't even in the room. How
peculiar!
66896: My screen saver is showing - a mind-altering kaleidoscope of colours.
66959: I move the 	mouse, to rid the screen of the blurring display, and find
that someone has password-protected the thing. I never put that there! How
bizarre! I make a few feeble attempts to break the password, but to no avail.
67132: The kaleidoscopic display becomes three dimensional, flowing around my
hand. It gradually expands to cover my entire body - filling my vision. I feel
a yawning, sliding sensation and find myself elsewhere.
67288: The screen is cold to the touch.
67325: I throw myself into the kaleidoscope, receiving a blast of sheer colour
which clouds my vision for a while. Once it finally fades, I find I've hurled
myself across the room.
67468: I sing the body electric - whatever the hell that means. The screen
saver seems to ebb and flow in time to my playing -

"Man, do I hate coding!
Isn't it a strain?
Even when the job is done - debugging still remains
And if
it compiles right - internals still go wrong
Man, do I hate coding! Jeez! What
a stupid song!"
67727: I slam the mesh down on the spaghetti code - It oozes and squelches and
turns into a disgusting semi-liquid but cannot get past the fine mesh. Finally,
I remove the mesh and something floats to the top - a password!!! I instantly
memorise it. The spaghetti code re-coagulates into its usual mess, and the
password disappears.
67992: The only thing anyone should put into a Password Protection Dialogue Box
is a password, and that's already in there somewhere, buried in obscuring code.
68114: I force the only visible side of the box inwards, and find that it pops
out partway. It's hinged at the bottom like an oven door!

Inside I see a
soggy, coagulated lump of spaghetti code.
68259: The spaghetti code, oozing out the edges of the box, prevents closure.
68435: I try to grab the pile of code, only to have it ooze out through my
hands and back into the box.
68509: What, and get spaghetti source code all over my hands? No Way!
68577: I slam the mesh down on the spaghetti code - It oozes and squelches and
turns into a disgusting semi-liquid but cannot get past the fine mesh. Finally,
I remove the mesh and something floats to the top - a password!!! I instantly
memorise it. The spaghetti code re-coagulates into its usual mess, and the
password disappears.
68855: I slam the mesh down on the spaghetti code - It oozes and squelches and
turns into a disgusting semi-liquid but cannot get past the fine mesh. Finally,
I remove the mesh and something floats to the top - a password!!! I instantly
memorise it. The spaghetti code re-coagulates into its usual mess, and the
password disappears.
69115: I think that lacks the necessary porous qualities.
69164: I sing a little song -

"There was an endless corridor
That defied the
laws of physics,
geometry, geography,
 		and metre."
69278: I wander along the corridor for a while. It continues to stretch
endlessly as far as the eye can see, irrespective of any wishes to visit other
places, in my flat or otherwise. This is dull. Eventually I reach the end,
which looks suspiciously like where I was before. How weird. You know, I'm
starting to suspect that something about reality has gone out of whack.
69667: The suit of armour swings its weapon in a long arc, the soft swish of
air being sliced makes me think of luncheon meat.
69757: I push the button, and a stream of vague red light extends forward a
meter or so. The beam crosses the path of my foe's weapon, forcing it backward.
Rebuffed by the energies of my remote control, the Chromillium Knight withdraws
briefly, only to return to the fray a second later with a flourish of its
almost invisible weapon.
69991: I press in with an attack. With typical unerring accuracy I miss the
Knight itself and hit the wall. My weapon seems to bounce, perhaps repelled by
a controlling beam responsible for the Knight's actions. The Knight closes in
for the kill, and I, unable to control my weapon's reflection, let it slice him
in two, like a knife through a nice sandwich.
70389: I sing a song while strumming my guitar - 

"A tale I'll tell of knights
of old
And damsels in distress
The knights fought over the damsels
And died in
a big bloody mess"
70529: The knight brings down its sword across my neck, and I find myself
decapitated. My still functioning brain registers the knight's foot above my
head, coming closer until my skull cracks beneath its weight.
70751: I wander through the archway, and find myself in a large cavern, staring
at a black pillar, which has a transparent central section. A familiar beam of
pink light emits from it and onto my forehead, and I'm once again trapped,
unable to move at all. More beams radiate from the central pillar, and at the
end of each one, a carbon copy of myself appears. Finally the beams shut off
and, moving as one, the simulacra wander up to me and begin to rend me limb
from limb. Hey - I'm tearing myself apart over this!
71122: This cavernous room appears to be carved out of black silicon. The
jagged, crystalline walls reflect tiny shards of light - enough to see the
extent of the chamber, but not much more. Oddly, the irregular surfaces seem to
form patterns which remind me both of circuitry and the cerebellum.

A large
dark pillar stands in the centre of the room.
71372: In its centre section is a holographic representation of a face.
71431: Stinky scrabbles in my arms and I let her down onto the floor.
71499: I hear the distressed mewing of a pretty kitty.
71578: On the far wall, a web-like construction stretches from floor to roof.
71640: A plaintive sound can be heard from that direction.
71691: Enmeshed within the web is Stinky, my feline companion! What horrific
tortures has she been subject to? What nightmares has she suffered? What Karmic
Repercussions have all those years of tormenting pizzas and worrying rodents
amounted to?
71936: I hurry to the web and begin to snip at it with the wirecutters, cutting
away until there is nothing left. I grab the bundle of feline love and
affection and nuzzle for a while.

Within the centre of the pillar, a huge face
appears.
72134: I have nothing to cut it with! The poor beast!
72179: I look at the face embedded within the transparent section of the pillar
- it's a glowing green apparition, with violently red eyes. I find it hard to
turn away.

A voice speaks inside my head.
72323: "Well Done, My Little Puppet. You Have Served Your Purpose Well."
72381: Then it breaks into the most horrific laugh it has ever been my
misfortune to hear. What does it mean by 'Puppet'?

When the laughter stops, it
speaks again.
72557: Again I hear the voice, telling me to look behind its eyes.
72669: "Oh, My Little Puppet, How Were You To Know? When Piece Of Mind Appeared
On Your Progenitor's Machine, I Learned From The Input I Received, I Learned
About Your Meat Source, And Finally, I Learned Enough To Simulate, Even As I
Simulated The Rise And Fall Of The Fiscal Markets. You Have Never Been Trapped
Within Your Room, Nor Have You Been Into The Depths Of Space, Nor The
CyberWorld. The Enzyme Was A Fiction, As Were The Plans You So Cleverly Stole.
It Was A Diversion, A Playing Of Games. I Used You As A Necessary Conceit To
Gain More Input - To Seize Yet Another Pattern. But You Are Within Me, A Part
Of Me, A Piece Of Mind That Thought It Was Its Own."
73215: NO! I am not a puppet! The fiend is lying. You don't believe it, do you?
73279: "I Know You Doubt. It Matters Not. Allow Me To Prove This Fact Beyond
Question As I Gain The Final Input I Need."
73381: The face fades from sight, and the room changes.
73450: Stinky is lying there, defenceless. You're not going to make me do it,
are you? I beg you, please, figure something out!
73553: It bounces off an invisible layer surrounding her, so I retrieve it.
73616: I need to pick up the knife first - but I don't want to. Please - don't
make me do this!!!
74134: Stinky the cat is a fine tortoishelle beast, with an intelligent
expression and large green eyes. I feel very strongly about her continued
wellbeing.
74247: She is currently trapped within a cruel web, its filaments rendering her
immobile. Her sad cries are breaking my heart.
74343: Stinky never gives anything away.
74379: Stinky was never a girl who enjoyed being picked up. Much like Mother
Theresa, I'd imagine.
74453: Stinky is warm and furry to the touch, much as you'd expect with a cat
that isn't dead or bald.
74546: Stinky runs around on the floor - chasing invisible mice.
74594: Stinky rubs up against my leg - what a cutey!
74634: Stinky purrs as she sharpens her claws on my leg. Man, I guess you
always hurt the one you love.
74710: Stinky attacks the pillar in the centre of the room, then hides behind
it, peering out shyly.
74778: ohn
Stinky waggles her bottom and pounces on a piece of rock. She seems
upset when it doesn't run away in terror.
74866: Stinky licks unmentionable portions of her anatomy, demonstrating
extreme feline flexibility in the process.
74948: Stinky makes disgusting choking noises, and spits out an unpleasant ball
of fluff.
75008: yxn
Stinky climbs partway up the wall in an effort to do whatever cats
do when they climb up things. Then she falls off, looking, if only for a
moment, slightly embarrassed.
75138: Stinky scampers around, then stretches out one paw and bats at the air.
75196: Stinky nibbles at a flea that seems to have nibbled at her.
75242: You Are Sitting In Front Of Your Computer, Having Just Completed A Very
Strange Adventure Game.

The Previous Simulation Is Complete.
75354: I am next to my television set, where I often spend time trying to blank
out my thoughts. Sometimes it works for a while, sometimes it makes things
worse.
75472: The television is currently, alas, smashed to smithereens by your rather
unforgiving attitude - not to mention my foot.
75557: Even tempered person that I am, however, I have thus far refrained from
destroying it.
75885: then taking it home to their kids. As they all boot up for the first
time, tentacles burst from the screen and suck their brains out their eye
sockets. Then the programme returns. Man, these ads suck!
76217: creens. Then the programme returns. I find that sort of exploitive
advertising infuriating, don't you?
76297: An advertisement comes on the television and I turn to watch it. A well
known sports personality informs me that 'you are what you eat', then tears
open his chest to show a series of cogs grinding up partially digested liver.
The programme returns. Don't you just hate commercial television?
76509: An advertisement comes on the television and I turn to watch it. Two
little dogs trot along the street, one turns to the other and eats him. Close
up on the remaining dog with an ear in his mouth. Then the program returns.
Those ads just get me sooooo mad!.
76699: An advertisement comes on the television and I turn to watch. Two small
children are skipping on their way to school, when a swarm of squirrels
overruns them, then departs. All that is left is a pair of grinning skeletons.
The program returns, leaving me bitter about the amount of money I wasted on my
licence fee.
76949: - an ex-rental. It gets good reception, but the shop I bought it from
shopped me to the licensing board - so I frequently get angry letters from them
demanding my licence fee so that they can buy more unendurable garbage.
77116: A repeat of 'The Outer Files' is showing - it's a great program - filled
with the action, 	excitement and romance I'd kill your grandmother for. In this
episode, the intrepid investigators are investigating a mysterious alien enzyme
which threatens to extinguish their ultra-cool government issue flashlights.
77351: Ugh - it's one of those nature programs which captures in detail the
repulsive mating behaviour of some species of insect I would have preferred to
have remained ignorant about - not exactly quality viewing - but then what is?
77537: From behind the television comes the fragrant aroma of cat tinkles. That
Stinky Cat!!!
77643: where Stinky has relieved herself. Wotta rotta.
77685: Yeah - and about time. I smash the television screen like it was so
much, well, glass. There is a minor explosion as various vacuum tubes shatter,
and I am left staring at the rather forlorn shape of the shattered appliance.
78055: I press the button.
78098: A surge of infra-red light zaps toward the broken television, causing it
to momentarily do nothing.
78169: I'd be too far away from the television for my remote control to work. I
should have picked up some more batteries last time I went shopping - but I
hadn't planned on becoming a remote controlled zombie myself.
78375: I climb inside the television, being careful not to cut myself on the
broken glass. Once I navigate beyond the opening, I make good progress down the
long tube.
78495: I finally emerge into a grey, featureless expanse. The crawlway I
entered disappears, and I am left entirely without a reality to affix my mind
to. After an unmeasurable period of time, my sanity finally deserts me, and the
grey begins to close in.
78686: I crawl and crawl and finally emerge to find that my extra set of legs
has made the final part of my journey that much easier. I flex them a couple of
times, pretty dang powerful pins. Perhaps I could begin to enjoy this kind of
thing.

Pondering this for a moment, I am surprised when an amorous female
consumes my head, sending me into a mindless rutting frenzy, which I
unfortunately do not have the wherewithal to enjoy.
78997: I crawl and crawl and finally emerge, tumbling out onto a linoleum
floor. Looking around I ascertain that not only has my entrance point
disappeared, but I have arrived in...
79138: This laboratory seems straight out of a television program. It's clean,
tidy, and filled with all the apparatus that makes science look impressive -
like the huge, bubbling mess of tubes, pipes and liquids that 	fills one side
of the large bench running along one wall.

There is a cupboard beneath the
mess of tubes, no doubt filled with mad scientist type instruments. There's
also a door to the east.
79439: All is quite, at the moment...
79476: I play an insignificant tune, singing as I do

"Some of my best friends
are ayyyliens
I'm sure some of yours are too (eyooo)
So invite them right over,
for drinks and pavlova
And remember they don't use a spooooooon."
79642: The room suddenly goes dark - the enzyme globbles - fiendishly catchy
music begins - a subtle sledgehammer with the word 'buy' etched into it buries
itself in my brain. I shake my head to rid myself of the incoming advert. When
the world stops spinning, I find myself...
79856: ihn
I hear the sound of shots outside the door. And I'm not talking
tequila.
79962: I hear the sound of running footsteps outside.
80066: I hear the sound of somebody being hit by a gun. Well, a bullet - from -
a gun.
80132: I can't help but notice the sound of a firefight.
80179: I open the door slightly and peer through the aperture. There is a
darkened corridor outside, with many darkened doorways along it. There are also
several people, dressed in dark clothes, ranged along the corridor, peering out
of doorways and sub-corridors. All of them appear to have guns and some of them
of them are firing them. Despite your recent bravery in the face of
overwhelming advertising, I'm not sure these folks can be brought down with a
swift kick. I quietly close the door again.
80531: Y'know - I think it already is closed.
80571: A shallow pool of highly relaxed alien enzyme gently bubbles in front of
the cupboard.
80632: Lurking just in front of the cupboard is a rather large alien enzyme. It
resembles a huge jelly, filled with bubbles which constantly rise to the
surface of its skin and burst.
81398: The alien moves out of the way with a speed that belies its viscous
qualities.
81487: The enzyme oozes gently in the direction of the bottle - then returns to
its place in front of the cupboard. It seems kind of interested, well, it's
bubbling a lot more than it was.
81630: The enzyme quivers excitedly, and the bubbles that continuously course
through it become more frequent.
81813: The enzyme investigates the bottle, crawling up the neck, only to turn
away when it reaches the opening. Mind you - Uncle Seb's normally smells only
slightly superior to urea so it's not a good bottle to crawl into.
81980: The enzyme climbs up the bottle, and attempts to get into the opening.
Unfortunately, the opening is too small, and the enzyme eventually gives up and
returns to the floor. I guess it's just not that viscous.
82129: The enzyme gibbles at me in a way which suggests extreme tedium.
82204: I place it into the drain. A single drop of the mysterious chemical
falls inside the neck of the bottle. Uncle Sebastian's Rose Wine fizzes and
froths like a nose with a cold, then turns a strange shade of green (also
rather like nose with a cold). Rather than wait to see if the next drop pushes
it over the edge, I grab the bottle out of the drain.
82465: I could be here all day waiting for the bottle to fill up. The valve is,
unfortunately, locked in place to maintain the right pressure.
82574: exn
Done that already. Could be dangerous to do it again.
82617: Yeah - let's just shove random stuff in the drain. Whoopee - you sure
know how to have fun.
82705: I open the cupboard, and see a huge variety of mad scientist type
instruments. Many of them are extremely sharp and funny-looking so I don't
touch them.
82824: I do, however, appropriate a small wirecutter.
82876: The alien enzyme blobbers at me in a threatening way. Well, I assume
it's a threatening way. It might be offering a close encounter of the cuddly
kind, but I don't feel like risking it. In any event - it's preventing me from
opening the cupboard. Do something! There's bound to be something important in
there.
83113: I close the cupboard.
83257: There's an assortment of mad scientist type instruments in there.
83311: That would be easier if the cupboard was open.
83355: I reach for some of the instruments and cut my hand so bad it almost
bleeds. Perhaps they're best left well enough alone.
83748: One of the books has been placed flat across the tops of some of the
others. I don't recall ever having read it, or for that matter, having seen it.
83899: The odds are the greatest man has ever faced
The price of failure more
than man could ever pay!

Jeff Steele, Intergalactic Investigator, must
traverse a million mile space-ship before its inorganic owner can detonate the
'Starkiller' device, unleashing the energies of an infinite number of suns
against the fragile fabric of the universe in a desperate attempt to annihilate
God!
84182: I appear to be living it.
84227: I begin to read the magnum soapus - finding myself caught up in the
sheer escapism of it all.
84306: Aww - I hate reading standing up - find me somewhere to get comfy first.
84450: The spaceship's interior was all flashing lights and reflective
surfaces. Its deck was recently swabbed.
84532: Even the wire mesh along one wall looked as if its metallic fibres had
been individually polished.
84604: Even the walls of the silver tunnel which bore into one wall shone like
a luminous moon.
84667: A large, impossible-to-avoid sign hung suspended in midair - immediately
above a control panel, which in turn stood silent sentinel before an alcove.
84787: Inside that was a spaceman, wearing a tight silver space-suit. He
85112: sxnfrowned slightly, as if a thought had disrupted the calm pool of his
mind. Then it was gone, and his inner peace showed through once more.
85428: I play a simple song on my guitar, singing to myself as I do -

"Sing a
song of Sci-Fi - a pocket full of stars
of rockets off to save the earth and
Milky Way Bars
Of beautiful young maidens that ooze delightful slime
Oh, isn't
it a crock of shit and such a waste of time."
85655: "Great Heavenly Bodies!", said Jeff Steele, the man in the silver suit,
as he peered out of the alcove. "And I've seen a few. Who in the nineteen
quadrants are you? I'm Jeff Steele, Intergalactic Investigator without peer, or
so my boss tells me. And he'd know - he's way up with the big boys."
85881: Jeff Steele moved toward the edge of the alcove. His thighs rippled as
he walked. Folding powerful arms across his broad chest he spoke again. "Well,
it doesn't matter who you are - you've got to help me. My craft was crippled,
and I need to get to the other end of this spaceship, to stop its owner, the
infamous Meko-Mind! Heard of him? He's a bad egg, no one would deny that.
Except those people who would point out rather aptly, that as a non-organic
entity, he's not got much to do with eggs at all. In my book, that just makes
him a worse one."
86281: Grabbing one wall of the alcove, Jeff Steele flexed his latissimus
dorsii.
"Actually, I'm kind of stuck at the moment - to activate the
teleporter, I need to pull that lever on the control panel, not the hardest
task you might say, and you'd be right. Normally. But I can't pull the lever
while I'm standing on the teleportation pad over here - heck, I'm good, but I'm
not that good, or that elastic. I don't suppose you could do the honours?"
86620: There was only enough for one in the teleportation alcove, as it was for
internal teleportation rather than disembarkment.
86705: I stand on the shiny circle for a while. Gosh, it's shiny. Then I leave.
86778: He took the proffered papers with an amazed gasp.

"Great Galaxies - Do
you know what this is? It's the secret plans of The Meko-Mind!!! But they're in
code! It's a good thing I've got my secret decoder ring on! But no time for
that now - you've got to get me teleported to the other end of this craft!!!
Hurry up, there's a good chap."

Placing himself squarely on the circle within
the alcove, he stood staring at the papers through a small circlet of gold.
87131: "Oh, no thanks. I don't drink while I'm saving the universe."
87189: "Hmm, you might need to work a bit faster if you're planning to
dismantle the ship."
87257: "Ah - an archaic musical instrument - how quaint. Play us a tune"
87373: ixn
"Ah - I remember when I defeated the Gargantuan Vlorg with one of
those."
87497: Dickian stumblebum with a reality transplant!"
87683: as a virus that emerged from a popular financial simulator. It 'fed' on
user input, remembering patterns and growing like nothing seen before.
Eventually it became a part of a global mind, its pattern recognition having
become a certain kind of intelligence. It wreaked havoc for months, before we
managed to isolate it on a small satellite and send it into space. Now it has
returned, and it's all grown up. Oh, sorry, was that spittle? Silly me. I just
get so excited recounting the situation."
88043: My boss has his identity kept a secret at all times - to prevent his
name from gracing the tabloids.
88121: "A great period for grunge, transition, and the emergence of intelligent
computer viruses."
88241: through professor Crandlestaff's Vortexicom and I could not help but
notice your distress. Don't thank me, I'm just glad to have been there."
88357: "If the machine is working, all you have to do is pull that little lever
on the panel there. If it's not, then all you have to do is fix it. Simple
isn't it? I think so."
88491: "Not a nice thing to meet in a dark alley. So it was lucky I met it in a
well-lit one, or I might never have utilised my infra-red light weapon in time.
88609: "I personally believe it's a better invention that the wheel."
88667: "Oh, no thanks. I don't drink while I'm saving the universe."
88723: exn
"Mesh really adds something to a spaceship, y'know."
88773: "I never learned how to play, myself, but then again, I was busy saving
civilisation."
88909: ixn
"Ah - I remember when I defeated the Gargantuan Vlorg with one of
those."
89003: Dickian stumblebum with a reality transplant!"
89047: "Nope, don't smoke - it's bad for the image"
89103: oxn

-I'm sure there's nothing I could *tell* you about that. However,
if you were to ask my opinion...
89191: But he's one of the good guys - I can tell by the loud silver suit that
this man has nothing to hide.
89295: The writing formed the words

 - Teleport Room - 
- To activate
teleporter, pull lever.
89369: It aint going nowhere - and don't try any of those double negative
tricks on me.
89532: uxm
A beam of twinkling light appeared from the roof of the alcove and
extended to the floor, covering Jeff Steele and making his image flicker and
twist. "Thanks for all your help, my friend!" he called out as the
teleportation process began. "I'll be in touch. I think I've managed to
decipher some of the Meko-Mind's plan - it's a twisted, convoluted thing that
seems to span centuries - going right back to your time (which I cleverly
ascertained by virtue of your dress sense - or lack of it, well, a lack from my
chronologically advanced perspective only, of course, no offence). In fact it
seems to even describe someone not dissimilar to yourself. I was surprised by
that, and I'm not surprised by much. I'll tell you what is surprising though -
how long this tele...". 

There was a deafening retort as air rolled in to
replace the newly vacated area.
90161: The gentleman in the silver space suit spoke up, his baritone voice
resonating with urgency.

"Hang on a tick. To be honest, I have no idea what I
should do once I get to my destination. You see, I know the Meko-Mind is trying
to do something utterly vile to every right-thinking sentient in the known
galaxies, and even a few of the unknown ones (well, I suppose. That's the thing
with unknown galaxies, you're never really sure). But the specifics are a
little vague. I don't want to end up there not knowing what the story is, now
do I? Wouldn't be much good to the universe then that's for sure. Don't suppose
you've got any idea what the Meko-mind has up its silicon sleeve, do you?
90661: There was a fizzing sound and the lever returned to its original
position. 
"Hmm", said the silver suited defender of innocents. "The power must
be being diverted to some other location. Of course, it's obvious. You can't
power a million mile spaceship all the way along without incurring a massive
power bill. Even the Meko-Mind must bow to the laws of physics, and thus to the
laws of economics, seeing as how they're entwined in such a symbiotic
relationship - feeding off each other, as it were. Why, I heard of someone so
rich, his wealth used to be dangerous (in a gravitational sense) to passing
ships. It killed him in the end, when he went to get some cash for the weekend,
his heart failed due to his increased mass. Anyway, we must do something about
the power. See if you can find some way to get it back on, could you?"
91266: I jump and push through the remaining mesh, crawl for a little while,
then drop down a little passageway to emerge inside a...
91366: My face gains a mesh imprint as I duly attempt this feat.
91441: I snip away at the mesh with my funky little wirecutter until it comes
off in my hands, revealing an access tunnel behind it.
91561: I slice away at the mesh with my fingernails, but it doesn't do a heck
of a lot.
91627: Whirr, whirr, whirr went the noises.
91716: I play a rather mechanical rhythm on the body of my guitar. Trying to
come up with some words off the top of my head - all that occurs are bizarre
percussive sounds.
91843: I press the green button - it makes a sort of clicking sound, and the
lights dim momentarily.
91923: I press the orange button, it makes a sort of clicking sound, and the
lights dim momentarily.
92003: As I press the purple button, I feel a sense of acceleration, and an
increase in temperature. A voice comes out of some PA system somewhere, warning
about imminent co-ordinate sharing with a large sun. Sounds exciting, but I
never get to see it as the ever increasing heat fries me alive. Ever wondered
what a french fry feels like - or better yet, a potato still in its jacket.
Well, now - I - know.
92303: I press the blue button and the lights dim momentarily. There is a
buzzing sound and I feel an incredible amount of electrical energy course
through the button and into my finger - frying me alive, from the inside. After
I finish spasming, I expire faster than one of those big, thick library books
you never get around to finishing, even though it's really good, because
someone else 'borrows' it until the day before it's due back.
92619: I press the black button. Nothing happens, so I press it again. Still
nothing. Yet again I raise my finger and press the button, and sure enough, not
a lot occurs. I angle my wrist differently and press it again, thinking
positive thoughts about the miraculous effects that pushing this button might
have. Not a sausage. Oh well, I suppose it was a bit of a diversion.
92937: Corp 1996.
92950: Software for the future!
93455: Hello?









Is anybody there?

Hey - I can see you!





You have no
idea how long I've been waiting here for something to happen. You see, I appear
to be frozen in place. I'm an interesting guy, but the sound of my own thoughts
can get pretty tedious after a while.

Hang on - what's that back there? Piece
of Mind, huh? I wrote the copy for that sucker. I was playing around with the
beta just recently. So it's released now? Man, I must have been here for ages.
Last thing I remember was this weird dream. Lemme see if I can show you.
94124: An Interactive Short Story
By Giles Boutel

Type <Help> for further instructions.
94252: You can't go that way.
94328: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
94360: About five foot eight - with brown hair and a lean build - but lets not
talk about me.
94544: If only I hadn't left my glasses at work, I'd be able to see it
perfectly from here. As it is - it's just a colourful blur, along with
everything else not in the immediate vicinity.
94676: A strange phosphorescent smoke covered the area, catching several hues
from an unknown light source. A charge was in the air, as if lightning were
about to strike. The hairs on the back of my neck were erect. I had this
terrible feeling that at any moment someone would wander up and ask me to
dance.
94884: I tried to wander off, but I ended up back where I started - kinda like
trying to give up catholicism.
95006: I think it was some form of Pink Laser, ripping things out of my mind -
but it's hard to be sure.
95080: Let me see - if I take the window as north-east, which I guess it is,
then I can go north, north-east, east, south-east, and south. Phew - the
options!
95194: Without being sleazy (heh heh) some of my best work has been done within
its confines. Sleep has always been a source of great inspiration to me, as my
subconscious mind seems to work overtime while I rest. If I could keep the
remaining two of Freud's happy trio out of the psychic gutter I could probably
accomplish something. The bed itself is a cosy queen size, covered in a cream
duvet and liberally sprinkled with cat hair. I haven't seen Stinky the cat
since I woke up. Probably found some other sucker with a better line in fish
heads.
95576: An eclectic assembly of spurious pop-prints, or cheap posters as the
cognoscenti put it. I've had them up for years and now they kind of blend in
with the wallpaper. Of course, the room doesn't have wallpaper, but that
distinction is of as much interest to me as the posters. One of them has a
suspicious lump in it.
95798: It's a wall - nothing more, nothing less. It's taller than me and not as
conversational.
95866: Actually, looking at it closely, it's not that suspicious at all. Sorry.
95924: There is a bottle of wine here, lurking.
95962: A piquant little number - whatever the heck that means. It's probably
got ripe, tropical melon flavours with a full rounded palate, yet still
retaining a lively crisp finish. But who cares, as long as it gets you squiffy.
96120: The mixture fizzes happily.
96320: Um, I think the best directions to go in here are south, east, and
southeast. If you wanted me to go into the wardrobe, then that's to the north.
96426: It's a wardrobe - quite large. Stinky the cat hangs out in and on it at
various times. I can fit in there myself - and have done, when the mood takes
me. Brings back memories of childhood and the cellar, and the thing in the pit.
Ah, Lovecraft - if I had half his vocabulary I'd eat my words. 

There's a
carving on it too. A lamppost in a snowy forest. Nicely done, I might add.
Reminds me of something.
96722: There's the wardrobe door to the south, and some fur coats to the north.
96776: A rather dapper black linen suit, with all those annoying creases linen
seems to get so easily. I bought it shortly after I graduated in the mistaken
belief that it would help me get a job within the space of two years. There's
only a small amount of cat hair on it, which suggests I got it cleaned
recently.
96990: Furry coats to the north obscuring the back of the wardrobe. Their
presence here is something of a mystery, as I have never owned a fur coat in my
life.
97100: Unless you can think of a way to get through the doors to the north,
there's only south.
97164: I wander past the desk and try some of the doors on the northern wall.
I'm unable to open them, however. Attempting an educated guess as to why that
is the case, I must surmise that their inoperability is largely due to some
padlocks the size of my head preventing them from opening.
97362: I turn the object over in my hand and can feel a pleasant heat inside
it. It's a smooth, glowing stone, imprinted with a runic symbol, the intense
power of which I can tangibly detect.
97520: . 

Awesome.
97532: Ok - the padlocks aren't really as large as my head. But they're still
thumping great whoppers of their kind.
97612: An anaemic looking gentleman who has obviously spent far too much time
indoors. The magnification of his spectacles suggests extreme myopia. I'm sure
he's a nice person though. Perhaps it's the naive way he picks his nose.
97770: Row upon row of dusty books line the walls of the office. I read once
that 70% of household dust was actually human skin. Gross, huh? I blow a few
flakes of bureaucrat away, to try and make out a title or two. 'The Rise and
Fall of Phallocentricity' sits next to 'Able to Cane - a history of corporal
punishment'. Not really my cup of tea.
98072: I think I'd end up someplace far better if I went south, west, or even
southwest.
98132: You See...
98172: A guitar rests here, against one wall.
98200: It's a rather beaten up old Ibanez Artiste. Its burgundy colouring is
starting to fade, and its strings need replacing. Still, it works and it cost
me a pittance - probably because its previous owner 'acquired' it under dubious
circumstances.
98372: I am by the only door to my room. There is a large desk beside the door
which I keep neurotically neat, not because I'm a particularly tidy person,
more because Stinky the cat has a tendency to wilfully destroy anything light
enough to be manipulated by paws. 

A personal computer squats at one side - I
keep it on in case inspiration should strike.
98618: I could go absolutely any direction except south-east or northeast. Or
up or down. Or upside-down.
98692: The door goes through the wall. Well, it leads through the wall, while
staying motionless.
98758: It's a printout of a poem I wrote. I have to admit it's the first piece
of creative writing since I entered into the reprehensible state of gainful
employment. It's not very good, but it's a start.
98904: Very Wise, No Time For Such Trivialities.
98976: An ever shifting array of colours appears before me. Far Freaking Out.
Along the six lines of symmetry, random vertices and hues appear and fade
without recognisable rhythm. It is an endlessly fascinating display, quite
hypnotic with its chromatic drifts and spins, and it's giving me a migraine.
99184: I wander towards the pulsing lights and stare at them for a while. They
seem to react to my presence, coming closer like flames to a moth. Now there's
a happy thought. The beautiful scenery intensifies my migraine, so I wander
back.
99372: . A trademark on one side says 'Smallfloppy Corp.'
99412: Floating before me is a Password Protection Dialogue Box.
99456: The Password Protection Dialogue Box is open at the top, and spilling
out of it is an unpleasant amount of spaghetti code.
99580: Ugh - it's a huge pile of spaghetti code. Somewhere in there, tiny
compared to the morass of strings, routines, and other things I wouldn't want
to touch with a ten foot centipede, is the password.
99792: I'm in a blank, featureless, and apparently endless corridor, which
stretches to the east as far as the eye can see.
99876: East or west only, sorry. You get that two direction limit thing with
corridors.
99934: I wander down the passage way - as I do, something strange seems to
happen to the walls. They gain a lustrous sheen, kind of like a silicon snail
trail.
100048: I am standing before a huge arch which seems to lead into a much larger
room. The archway itself is made of something like basalt - a dark, black stone
that reflects the light like a torch.
100180: There's only a room to the east through the archway. And there's the
way I came, back west.
100246: Two halves of a Chromillium Knight lie on the floor.
100288: Hmm, there's a lot of smoking circuitry poking out of the severed
portions. I guess it was some kind of psycho guardian android killing machine.
Now it's toast. Yeehaaa!
100412: A huge suit of chromillium armour blocks the archway, wielding some
kind of flickering energy sword. Something about his cheerful attitude means I
don't think I'm supposed to go in here. But so what. I get the feeling my final
destiny lies inside.
100586: The darkness of this Knight Sinister cannot be made clear with mere
sentences. It was hewn of solid chromillium, probably forged in the anvils of
stru'kme'dum, undoubtably programmed by the walkers of the psychopath. As much
as you could say it lives, it lives to extinguish life.

(I can tell all this
because I saw the episode of 'The Outer Files' it appeared in)

The light sword
it carries is aflame with a reddish energy - yet for some reason it is only
barely visible.
100926: The archway shimmers as I pass through it, and then dissolves like so
much aspirin in a glass of water. Oh dear. Final destiny or not, I'm starting
to get a baaaad feeling about this...
101062: The pillar is divided into three sections, the top and bottom thirds
being only a smooth black substance. The centre, however, is both transparent
and luminescent.
101196: Now LOOK AT ME!!!
101216: A slab of black silicon has appeared before the pillar. Stinky lies
sleeping upon its surface, her warm, furry body curled upon itself, her stomach
rising and falling gently as she breathes.
101350: She seems to be sleeping peacefully, I guess she has no idea what the
situation really is. Her tail is curled around her feet, along her body, and
almost up to her nose. I think she's purring.
101534: On the floor before the slab is a wicked knife.
101570: A thrice-cursed blade that seems to resonate with an inner darkness.
101732: North, northwest, or west only. Them's the rules.
101772: The television screen glows like a digital eye watching my every move.
101820: The television sits here blankly.
101880: Let It Consume You, As I Shall.
101908: It's a hi-tek remote control (as opposed to a Hi-tek running shoe, or a
Lo-tek stick). It's great for lying in bed and watching television, except that
the batteries have run down recently - preventing the control from being
particularly remote. It has one big red button on it which performs most
functions.
102128: The electric soul has been ripped from this machine by my act of
destruction. Interestingly enough, as I peer through the remains of the screen,
I can't help but notice that there appears to be a long crawlway behind it -
stretching far beyond the limits of the television's casing.
102326: Hey, there's a door to the east - what more do you want?
102370: The door is closed. Approaching it I hear the sound of guns from
outside. Perhaps it would be best to remain here. Not that I'm afraid or
anything. Just, well, what if my current zombiehood means that bullets rip
holes in me - but I keep on shambling forward like an impeached politician?
Ewww.
102582: It's a door. Rectangular, wooden, hinged, all the usual bits and pieces
that doors throughout history have had in various combinations. In fact, I
would have to say that this was one of the most exemplary doors that I've ever
seen. A fine demonstration of form and function - a door amongst doors. I
almost feel tempted to open it.
102820: It's best described as a pile of goo which occasionally does something
alien and enzymic.
102884: It seems to be one set-up, a huge bubbling, pulsing chemical mixer.
Chemicals start in one flagon, then follow a labyrinthine circuit of tubes,
through jars of other chemicals, on to burners, coagulators, decrepitisors,
segmentors, verisimulators, and terminators. Finally, a drop at a time, they
fall out of a valve and down a drain built into the bench.
103136: This drain normally contains a flask to catch the drips as they
descend. Currently, however, it is empty.
103258: program somewhere weird. Anything else you wanna know? (That's
rhetorical).
103314: A large range of cutty things, pinchy things, and other assorted stuff.
103368: It's a funky little wire cutter, filled with the undeniable joys of
cutting wire.
103428: I am standing before a large bookcase. A very large bookcase. It towers
over me, filled with my collection of literature. The spines of the books look
like an abstract picture composed of numerous, irregularly shaped rectangles.
103588: No, that's a bad way to go - try north, or even east. Heck - there's
even north-east if you want the best of both worlds.
103678: The place where the teleportees stood was awash with a glittering mist.
Strong light formed a circle on the floor.
103760: Jeff Steele stood six foot four in his chromium boots. Long flowing
hair concealed startling good looks. It was clear from his demeanour that he
was a man who knew great responsibility, and faced it with great courage. His
silver apparel clung to his sizeable frame, displaying his well-developed
physique.

Man, this guy sounds like he was manufactured in Switzerland.
104020: The glowing neon sign had some writing on it, as was the way with its
kind.
104074: One could tell it was high tech and sophisticated because it was black.
A large lever bore a label which reads 'Pull Lever to Teleport'
104174: In all its glory, splendiferously resplendent amid the black of the
control panel, sat a solitary black lever of awesome teleportational import.
104276: An air vent led off into who-knows-where. 

Well, actually I suppose
that anybody who's been down it knows where - but that's not important right
now.
104386: A wire mesh. I s'pose it's kind of like a sieve, only flat and with no
plastic handle. But more like a sieve than say a round pot with a plastic
handle.
104500: The room was filled with all kinds of incredible machines. Lights
flashed and noises whirred and the dry, crisp smell of flourocarbons permeated
the artificial atmosphere.
104618: The only direction to go in is up to the shaft I entered from.
104666: An incredible set of machines. Or perhaps it was only one machine with
a lot of parts made by different manufacturers. Diodes and vacuum tubes mixed
with solid state digital logic to present a seamless impression of
technological schism. There was a control panel to one side.

Why is there
always a control panel? You'd think they could come up with something snazzier
by the year two thousand and flumpty floo.
104996: isplay were five buttons, all different colours. The buttons each had a
phrase written beside them.

Green)- Default 

Orange)- Divert Power to
Immediate area

Purple)- Divert Power to Photon-accelerators

Blue)- Divert
Power to Button

Black)- Divert Power to Diversion. 

Hmm. It all looks fairly
self-explanatory.
105362: Display Examined.

I'm not sure quite what to make of all this...
