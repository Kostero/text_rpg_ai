47031: A box sitting in the corner, with status lights to show you that your
network connection is currently fine.
47168: You've already turned the router off, remember?
47214: The router is already on.
47251: As the router's status lights fade and its humming ceases, you hear the
most amazing sound from the depths of the building.  It's like a scream... the
sound of Ultimate Pain.  It goes on and on, finally fading out after several
minutes.

Chills creep up your spine.
47629: After a moment, the status lights indicate that your network connection
is restored.
47804: There used to be two laser printers sitting on it; now there is only
one.
47868: sitting beside the remaining printer is a freshly-printed copy of "The
Inform Designer's Manual."
47951: You don't really want to be accused of losing *two* laser printers, do
you?

48195: What an odd idea!

Nothing to print.
48790: Still more work to do!

49359: All you hear is the comfortable humming of the water fountain.
49416: A surreal idea.
49467: Didn't you read the sign?

49609: Buried beneath the fire hose you find a flashlight!
49959: You don't particularly need to carry around a fire hose.
50034: Buried beneath the fire hose you find a flashlight!

50351: You can't examine a hum!
50484: When you pick yourself up off the floor, through the office window you
notice the curved silver dome of a van de Graff generator, which some wag has
connected to the doorknob... (wiseacre physics graduate students!)

You can now
carry fewer objects than before.
50735: You belatedly remember what happened the first time you touched the
doorknob, but it's too late now.
50928: When you pick yourself up off the floor, through the office window you
notice the curved silver dome of a Van de Graff generator, which some wag has
connected to the doorknob... (wiseacre physics graduate students!)

You can now

51179: You belatedly remember what happened the first time you touched the
doorknob, but it's too late now.
51278: Fancy that!
51366: You can't, since the panel is in the way.
51644: You wonder if you really want to go into this hole.
51731: It's really rather irritating.
51766: A surreal idea.
51787: To one side, a water fountain buzzes noisily.
52029: Funny, that.
52141: You move the water fountain aside.

There's a square metal panel behind
it.
52216: You move the water fountain back into place.
52255: Why would you want to take the water fountain?
52304: You see something that might be a panel behind the water fountain.
52359: What panel?
52416: You wonder what's on the other side of it.
52449: The panel opens to a dark, ominous hole leading down.
52518: What panel?
52540: What panel?
52556: You'll have to open it first.
52587: You open the panel, revealing a dark, ominous hole leading down.
52655: Didn't you read the sign?
52691: Didn't you read the sign?
52719: All you hear is the comfortable humming of the water fountain.
52776: A surreal idea.
52815: There is a door on the south wall.
52840: The door on the north wall is closed.
52875: The door on the south wall is open, leading to a janitor's closet.
52924: The door on the north wall is open.
52983: It won't open.
53001: You can't.
53166: You hear furious typing alternated with pauses of varying length.
53219: This place is so full of junk, you could spend all night looking through
it.
53283: You don't have time to play this stuff!
53321: There's a sign on this side of the door.
53352: A non-descript institutional door.
53422: The red fish glances at you in a bored fashion.
53462: The red fish darts around furiously for a moment.
53568: The red fish picks at the gravel in the aquarium hopefully.
53616: The red fish picks at some algae growing on the aquarium glass.
53685: Whatever for?
53721: As you turn to head back into the hall, you notice there's a sign on
this side of the door.
53799: A quiet hum.
53810: All you hear is the low hum of the aquarium filter.
53876: There's a small label on the base of the aquarium.
53998: The fish sees it almost before you do and darts quickly to eat it.
54144: The fish turns in a circle twice.
54268: The fish races for the surface of the aquarium and actually clears the
surface, re-entering the water with a small splash.
54363: The fish doesn't answer.
54387: The fish has no interest in your sordid life.
54427: You can't do that without getting soaked.
54463: Surely, you jest?
54485: The fish has no interest in your offering.
54516: The fish has little interest in anything but food.
54558: The fish ignores you.
54590: You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
54839: Remembering the students who disappeared, you get chills up and down
your spine.
55166: In the creepy darkness, you hear the approach of a sinister geologist.
He (it?) grabs you and carries you off to a mine deep under the University,
where you live out the rest of your days digging samples for the Geology
Department.
55339: You bump around in the creepy darkness for a while without any idea
where you are.
55519: As you leave the maze, you have a profound sense of relief.
55580: As you leave the maze, you have a profound sense of relief...

...but as
you enter the room, the gnome attacks you, pounding you unconscious as he
screams about internet connections, printers, and the Inform Designer's Manual
(2nd Edition).  You wake up in the hospital.
55809: As you start to leave, you notice a sign on the wall near the entrance.
55871: "Here now, laddie, write your own game!"
55911: The gnome glares at you until you put them down.
55951: The gnome looks you up and down and drily remarks, "You don't get out
much, do you?"
56067: Umm, no, I don't think so.
56113: The gnome must not want it to be stolen or something.
56167: The geeky-looking gnome grabs the stolen printer, insisting that it's
not going anywhere until he has the manual he needs.
56281: You want to put the printer *where*?
56573: To get it back to the Computer Center!
56802: The little grey mouse hasn't a clue what you're talking about.
56854: You advance menacingly upon the little grey mouse, who, sensing your
intent, bolts for a hole and disappears.

Good job!  Now you'll have to find
your way through the maze yourself.
57004: can hit the little grey mouse, it bolts for a hole and disappears.

Good
job!  Now you'll have to find your way through the maze yourself.
57266: The little grey mouse, sensing your intent, scampers out of reach and
chitters at you, clearly scolding.
57346: Amazingly, the little grey mouse allows you to approach and stroke its
soft fur.
57429: A little grey mouse scurries into the room.  It seems unusually
friendly, and occasionally casts an expectant glance in your direction.
57537: The little grey mouse scurries about, occasionally casting an expectant
glance in your direction.
57614: The little grey mouse is starting to look impatient.
57661: The little grey mouse is looking really very impatient.
57706: i.
The little grey mouse, tired of waiting for you to follow, races off.
57904: You follow the mouse out of the maze with a profound sense of relief...
57989: A geeky-looking gnome sits staring into the computer, muttering dire
curses at his modem, the phone company, the author of the language he's writing
a game in, the computer, the printer, and anything else he can think of.
58147: A geeky-looking gnome sits staring into the computer, thoroughly
engrossed in writing his game.
58223: The gnome grumbles something about deadlines and goes back to writing
his game.
58300: The gnome looks a little uncomfortable.

"I need to get an Inform
manual.  I'd've gotten the printer back to you by now, but I can't get this
bleeping connection to hold long enough to download it.  Then the printer
driver keeps crashing.  I'll get it to work, though, if it takes all
night."

Carefully, you explain that you don't have all night, but the gnome
won't let you near the printer.  He obviously cares more about his game than
your job.
58632: Distractedly, the gnome tells you that entries in the 1996 IF
Competition are due in at the beginning of October.
58726: The gnome looks determined.

"It's an interactive fiction writing
contest.  I'm sure to win it if I can only get a bleeping Inform Manual."
58978: If you're so hot on getting the printer back, YOU bring me either Graham
Nelson or a copy of the Inform Manual!"
59070: "It's a far sight better than that awful UGGS you're using!"
59206: He's the author of Inform, laddie."
59434: I like it."
59568: How'd you get this job, anyway?"
59716: He puts his face in his hands, shakes his head, then goes back to
cursing at his computer.
59781: The gnome grumbles something about deadlines and goes back to writing
his game.
59836: The gnome just grunts at you.
59864: "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
60126: "Who died and left *you* in charge?"
60263: There's a message blinking on the computer screen at your desk.
60675: to pay your tuition next semester - is, shall we say, history.  You
sigh.  It's not going to be just another...
61086: The doorknob has an *electric* personality...
61135: You lose the game if you don't remember what happened the first time you
touched it!
61206: There are two different ways to lose the game by bumping around in the
maze without the flashlight (or with it turned off).  It may take several tries
to see both of them.
61337: This affects your score, but you still win the game.
61391: a.
Hints for:
61630: All Puzzles with Hints:
61778: Hints Available:
62567: You haven't found a puzzle yet to have a hint available!
62716: No hints are available to be reviewed.
62803: Hints are now disabled.
62831: Hints are already on!
62848: Hints cannot be re-enabled after being disabled.
63306: Text adventures are driven by commands from the player.  Basic movement
commands include EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH, ENTER, UP, DOWN, etc.  Objects can
be manipulated with verbs such as TAKE, PUT, TURN, and so on.  Usually you give
a verb followed by an object; articles are generally ignored.  DROP THE BALL is
equivalent to DROP BALL.
63587: To see what you, the player character, may be carrying, type INVENTORY
(which is short for TAKE INVENTORY).  To end the game, type QUIT.  To save your
game so that you may resume it later, type SAVE, and to resume it later, type
RESTORE.  The score in this game is given on the status bar, at the top right,
but if you'd like to see how your score is broken down, type FULL.
64038: JECT.
64049: If you have trouble, try a few more commands, or see the online hints.
64102: Good luck!
64121: This game uses Adaptive Hints for Inform, by Michael S. Phillips.  To
activate the hint system, type HINT or HINTS.
64399: Hodges Hall really exists, as does its computer site (or at least the
computer site existed when I was a student there, more years ago than I care to
admit), at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia.  The map
layout, sans maze, is fairly accurate, simplified for game purposes.  The
legend of students disappearing is entirely a product of my disordered
imagination.
64674: The odd geography of Hodges Hall is due to the fact that it is built on
a steep hill.  It it possible to walk out of doors from the basement, ground
floor, 1st floor, and 2nd floor and be on the street.  The halls are very long,
and there really are stairwells on both ends.  Please don't blame me for this;
I only went to school there.  Also, please note that this is a real building at
a real University in West Virginia, USA.  The floor numbering is therefore
American numbering, not European; the numbering is faithful to the actual
building, and not an effort to annoy my friends across the pond.
65105: I owe much to my husband, Jeff Mierzejewski, for putting up with the
many late nights I spent learning to program in Inform while writing this game.
 Second only to him is my dear friend Thomas R. Jackson, M.D., who took time
out of his busy schedule to alpha-test the game.  Thanks also to Michael S.
Phillips, for his Adaptive Hints for Inform.
65360: Thanks also to the beta testers (most of whom were official
Competition96 beta testers) who gave me some great feedback (much of which I
incorporated into the game): Matthew Amster-Burton, Valerie Balavage, Charles
Carr, Matthew Daly, Michael Kinyon, Michael S. Phillips, and Brendon Wyber.
65581: Finally, I wish to give credit to Graham Nelson, author of Inform. About
him, and his contribution to IF in general, nothing really need be said.
65739: You're not carrying a light source.
65779: You're not carrying a light source.
65814: You find nothing of interest.
66014: A second or so later, the cooler kicks in and the water becomes so cold
that it makes your teeth hurt.
66086: How?
66094: Nothing happens.

68940: To one side, a water fountain hums quietly.
68972: It's an ordinary water fountain, such as is found in numberless
institutions across the US.
69076: You can go east here as well as north or south.
69212: It's just an ordinary door.
69232: You know, ugly grey, doors meet in the middle, etc.
69610: To the east is a door leading into a lab.
69640: The lab door is open.
69656: The lab door is closed.
69902: Next to the aquarium is one of those mysterious pieces of equipment, a
black box with three buttons.
69972: It says: Herring Aid Lab.
70130: Next to the aquarium lies a smallish black box with three buttons.
70176: It's aquarium gravel.
70192: A smallish box, black in colour, with three buttons on top: white, blue,
and green, from left to right.
70268: It reads: Acme Red Herring.
70292: It's a small white button on the black box.
70324: It's a small blue button on the black box.
70356: It's a small green button on the black box.
70598: Only geologists live down there.
70624: Getting claustrophobic, are we?
70648: Dead end.
70860: On the listings you see intriguing bits of code, but the gnome won't let
you close enough to them to make anything out.
70944: They look familiar somehow, like you've seen them before somewhere, but
you're at your wits' end trying to decide where....
71086: Hmm....
71140: Hmm...
71196: Minor, by J.S. Bach.
71216: It looks like a regular boombox, playing Bach.
71404: There's a sign on the wall near the entrance.
71474: Perhaps the gnome is forgetful?
71554: His button-down shirt sports a pocket protector holding a variety of
pens, he has Coke-bottle glasses with thick black rims, and his eyes have the
look only gained from consuming four liters of Jolt Cola.
71700: "The Inform Designer's Manual" by Graham Nelson, Second edition, 23
October 1995... The latest issue!
71784: The message reads:
   "Cute game.  I fixed the errors on lines 23, 114,
304, 735 and 982.  If you want my opinion, though, I'd say keep your day job.
 
  [signed] Polygrenthus Q. Gnome"
71950: You are likely to be eaten by a geologist.
72036: For amusement, try any or all of the following:   
        Touch the
Physics Office doorknob.   
        Touch it again.   
        Bump around in
the maze without the flashlight.                
        Drop the stolen
printer after retrieving it.
72232: Touch the Physics Office doorknob.
72260: Touch it again.
72304: Where'd the printer go?
72324: The shadowy figure could only go down...
72356: Have you thoroughly searched the first floor?
72388: There's an interesting door there...
72416: Enter the janitor's closet and LISTEN.
72448: What do I do next?
72464: The owner of the grumbling voice in the janitor's closet has the stolen
printer, but the entrance to his location isn't on the first floor...
72564: Try wandering around on the second floor.
72596: See the next section of hints for more info on what to do on the second
floor.
72652: What do I do in the lab?
72672: Have you noticed the black box?
72696: Have you tried pushing the buttons on the black box?
72732: Don't reveal any more hints unless you've found the wrench.
72776: The wrench is under the lab tables.
72856: It's a red herring.
72872: So is the hint about the wrench.
72912: Something's different on the second floor...
72948: Check out strange noises...
72972: It wasn't the humming doorknob!
73056: Isn't the description of the water fountain on the second floor a little
different?
73116: MOVE THE FOUNTAIN.
73176: Kind of dark down there, isn't it?
73204: See the next section of hints for more info on what to do about the
darkness.
73260: The light and the dark.
73280: Search the third floor...
73300: See that box?
73312: SEARCH the red box.
73332: GET the flashlight (our UK friends may call it a TORCH).
73380: As a convenience, you may activate or deactivate the flashlight by
typing just ON or OFF.
73474: Help comes to those who wait...
73500: The mouse really *does* seem to know where it's going...
73600: Just FOLLOW the mouse and your path is easy.
73652: The mouse only leads you one way, TOWARD the gnome's lair.
73700: But the gnome is forgetful...
73724: The gnome has posted the directions out of the maze by the exit.
73820: Now what?
73828: The gnome needs a copy of the Inform Designer's Manual.
73872: You have a way of getting him one.
73896: Go back to the Computer Center and follow the directions in the next set
of hints.
73968: Have you checked out the computer on your desk?
74022: I wonder what the (computer) mouse can do with them?
74132: Then you need to download the file...
74182: Voila!
74188: Okay, here's the exact sequence:
