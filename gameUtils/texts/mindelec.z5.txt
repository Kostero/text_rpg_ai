10872: Your mind appears to be blank today.
10935: [You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
10976: kec   gpm[Your interpreter does not provide "undo". Sorry!]
11043: [Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
11225: Sorry, that can't be corrected.
11260: Think nothing of it.
11283: d."Oops" can only correct a single word.
11602: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
11675: You can hardly repeat that.
11905: You can't begin with a comma.
11962: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
12053: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
13694: I didn't understand that sentence.
13801: I didn't understand that number.
13833: You can't see any such thing.
13866: You seem to have said too little!
13898: You aren't holding that!
13927: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
13967: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
14046: You excepted something not included anyway!
14084: You can only do that to something animate.
14122: That's not a verb I recognise.
14152: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
14208: You can't see "
14253: I didn't understand the way that finished.
14374: There are none at all available!
17177: Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which one exactly?
25398: At the moment, "it"
25474: and "me" means
25501: exn** Player objects must have "number" prop **
26078: Your "body" is a crude model, textured with some type of rock, almost as
if you were a golem.
26159: You cannot smell, this is virtual reality.
26195: You hear a constant electric hum in the distance.
26238: You cannot taste, this is virtual reality.
26276: You get no response.
26298: You really wish you could, but you don't have a body at the moment to
sleep in.
26360: Violence is impossible in that way while in virtualspace.
30957: M.
35780: Nothing to do!
35796: . You have died
35976: fhn[Your interpreter does not provide "undo". Sorry!]
36074: Please give one of the answers above.
36171: Please answer yes or no.

36225: Are you sure you want to restart?
36251: Failed.
36268: Restore failed.
36281: Ok.
36296: Save failed.
36307: Ok.
36322: The game file has verified as intact.
36349: The game file did not verify properly, and may be corrupted (or you may
be running it on a very primitive interpreter which is unable properly to
perform the test).
36524: Transcripting is already off.
36547: End of transcript.
36569: Score notification on.
36591: Score notification off.
36615: You have visited:
36662: None.
36887: You are carrying nothing.
36930: Taken.
36942: You are always self-possessed.
37062: You already have that.
37150: That isn't available.
37193: That's hardly portable.
37217: That's fixed in place.
37241: You're carrying too many things already.
37317: Already on the floor.
37339: You haven't got that.
37382: Dropped.
37427: But it isn't there now.
37451: You'll need to take it off first.
37476: Removed.
37557: You can't put something on top of itself.
37635: You lack the dexterity.
37715: Done.
37757: You need to be holding it before you can put it into something else.
37837: Alas, it is closed.
37859: You'll need to take it off first.
37889: You can't put something inside itself.
37979: Done.
38021: That isn't in your possession.
38044: First pick that up.
38338: That's not something you can enter.
38406: You can only get into something on the floor.
38523: But you aren't in anything at the moment.
38592: You are on your own two feet again.
38624: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
38725: You can't go that way.
38884: is now in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gives long
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
38986: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).
39074: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
39367: Darkness, noun. An absence of light to see by.
39489: But it's dark.
39502: You find nothing of interest.
39535: But it's dark.
39625: You find nothing of interest.
39653: You can't see inside, since it is closed.
39752: That doesn't seem to be something you can unlock.
39794: It's unlocked at the moment.
39822: That doesn't seem to fit the lock.
39876: That doesn't seem to be something you can lock.
39942: First you'll have to close it.
39970: That doesn't seem to fit the lock.
40024: That's not something you can switch.

40340: That's not something you can close.
40372: It's already closed.
40416: You're not wearing that.
40464: You can't wear that!
40486: You're not holding that!
40510: You're already wearing that!
40560: That's plainly inedible.
40591: . Not bad.
40609: That was a rhetorical question.
40637: This dangerous act would achieve little.
40671: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
40707: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
40795: What a good idea.
40815: You smell nothing unexpected.
40869: You taste nothing unexpected.
40949: You feel nothing unexpected.
40975: Digging would achieve nothing here.
41007: Cutting that up would achieve little.
41039: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
41073: You would achieve nothing by this.
41103: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
41137: But there's no water here to carry.
41169: Oh, don't apologise.
41191: Real adventurers do not use such language.
41227: Quite.
41239: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
41273: There's not enough water to swim in.
41305: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
41339: You can't usefully blow that.
41417: No, you can't set that to anything.
41480: But you aren't holding that.
41545: It is fixed in place.
41567: You are unable to.
41587: That would be less than courteous.
41612: Nothing obvious happens.
41641: Is that the best you can think of?
41671: That's not a direction.
41690: Not that way you can't.
41740: You achieve nothing by this.
41771: Futile.
41778: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
41827: You talk to yourself a while.
41850: This provokes no reaction.
41878: There is no reply.
41898: Nothing is on sale.
41944: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
41982: Time passes.
41998: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
42120: Score:
42263: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
42312: You can't see any such thing.
42427: That's just scenery.
42463: You are contained.
42489: The only exit is down.
42506: You are contained.
42529: The only exit is down.
42546: You are contained.
42567: Your virtual hand fades for a moment, and as you take your arm back,
reappears.
42629: Attacking a virtual fence with a virtual body is pointless.
42722: You find nothing of interest.
42745: Beyond the door, you can see nothing but black.
42783: You are contained.
42831: Nothing seems to happen.
42855: Nothing seems to happen.
42948: It resembles the type that opens with some sort of password, although
going through the entire dictionary to open it would take an inordinate amount
of time.
43061: Out of the corner of your eye you see a piece of paper suddenly appear
on the ground. Very odd. Any anomalous material in a containment grid should
immediately set off an alarm, but there is no sound.
43211: Your best efforts yield nothing.
43245: O HnYou can't do that.
43290: The paper is sucked into the fence structure and disappears.
43338: It feels more like a piece of plastic than a piece of paper because of
its virtual nature.
43415: It has the word "lxprog" imprinted on it.
43451: It is blank.
43467: It has the word "flood" imprinted on it.
43498: It has the word "ivory" imprinted on it.
43542: The paper gives off a brief flash of light.
43585: The paper gives off a flash of light that lasts about five seconds.
43642: A disembodied voice announces, "Location program complete, intruder has
been located, sentac pulse now active."

The world becomes liquid and void,
without form...
43796: In the distance you can hear the sound of metal shifting.
43888: You hear a popping noise from far above.
43924: For half a second you hear a crackling noise.
43964: Something just made a sound like a mouse dying.
44004: An intense burst of white noise disappears as quickly as it came.
44056: A sound like creaking floorboards can be heard from far above.
44118: An streak of void splits across the room, breaking the cube into parts.
It cries out, and in a fading voice says, "goodbye.....".
44220: You hear a distorted voice announce "lxprog complete." The view becomes
thin, and the last thing you see before you black out is snow. 

You can
vaguely feel and hear the sensations and sounds of being grabbed and carried,
of voices in confusion, and of a gigantic explosion, but the first time you
truly awake is at...
44451: a.
You see a tall man sitting next to a tree.

The man notices you
awaking and motions for you to stay seated. "The transfer to your real body has
put you through much strain, especially since I had to speed up the program a
little."

You have the extreme urge to say something, but your mouth is unable
to move. Your entire body is exhausted.

"I know what you want to ask. You want
to know why I saved you. I thought perhaps I could get someone to understand
the true nature of the war, and after such a situation you may understand
without me even telling you."

The man studies you in silence for a few
moments, and then says, "You see, the war between the Kaden and Souden is not a
real war, for a just cause, or even a lost cause, but a cycle. The impact of
the loyalty transfer programs has been that the war is merely a transfer of
people from one loyalty to the other, repeatedly, so much that their identity
is lost. The war is a collection of toy soldiers marching back and forth across
a line, and slowly dying out. You are all fighting yourselves, each other, all
on the same side."
45222: "But you may still not understand until you know who created the cube,
which died in saving you at the base."

The tall man pauses for a moment to
catch his breath, then speaks very slowly:

"
45394: A voice of unknown location announces: "Maintenance level manual
checking now active."
45471: The cube says, "I have received a message of unknown origin. It says:
spidlower."
45545: A voice announces: "Maintenance level 2 active."
45589: A voice announces: "Maintenance level 3 active." You are feeling
somewhat sleepy, even though sleep here is impossible.
45684: A wave on unconsciousness overcomes you...
45746: The cube looks concerned. "The execution of lxprog has been halted.
Something is stopping the program from running."
45847: Your body seems to be getting less stable.
45887: Spots and pieces of void are appearing on your virtual skin.
45939: Your body has almost completely faded away.
45980: Fragments of nothing crowd your vision, and the world fades away...
46043: Going through the sky seems to have put a strain on your body.
46095: Spots and pieces of void are appearing on your virtual skin.
46147: Your body has almost completely faded away.
46188: Fragments of nothing crowd your vision, and the world fades away...
46260: A voice without direction or origin announces "Scanning program
initiated for sector 482."
46339: "Scan in process for sector 482."
46373: "Scan in process for sector 482."
46407: "Scan in process for sector 482."
46452: a   i,
"Scan of sector 482 complete."
46489: "WARNING: INTRUDER ALERT, ACTIVATING SENTAC PULSE."
46556: The world becomes liquid and void, without form...
46609: You can't go that way.
46641: You can't go that way.
46673: You can't go that way.
46710: The cube looks concerned. "The execution of lxprog has been halted.
Something is stopping the program from running."
46804: The cube says, "I have received a message of unknown origin. It reads:
spidlower."
46874: Light bounces off glassy walls in every direction for a dazzling effect.
Crystals protrude from the wall at odd angles. Sparks of electricity are passed
back and forth. The entire room vibrates and hums like a large electric
generator.
47046: Portals are placed to the north and south as well as the ceiling and
floor.
47099: Portals are placed in all the main directions.
47137: Very nice looking. It is hard to believe that they aren't real.
47205: The rock emits a loud warbling noise and vanishes. In its place appears
a red cube, rotating slowly clockwise, with a humanlike face on each side so no
matter where you are standing a face can be seen.

The expressions of the faces
change together, like they are connected by a giant string; the mouths are
moving rapidly, as if speaking, but they make no sound.
47462: A floating red cube, slowly rotating clockwise. Molded into each side,
like a child's lump of clay, is a humanlike face, complete with facial
expressions and moving lips.
47588: It looks like it is trying to say something, but the words don't come
out.
47641: It smiles as it sees you watching it.
47682: The cube moves its lips slightly but it seems unable to talk.
47741: The cube can't move.
47758: "I don't understand."
47819: The cube moves its lips slightly but it seems unable to talk.
47869: "I'm not sure exactly which model you mean but they are used mainly for
maintenance."
47941: "Hello, although I've already met you before."
47989: "I am neither male nor female."
48025: "I am neither male nor female."
48057: "I know not of the essence of my existence."
48097: "Nice simulation, don't you think?"
48150: "It's just some practice words to get setup. Apparently my designer
thought the words I used would be appropriate, although I don't know where they
came from."
48276: "I was created by a human of whom I can recognize the face and voice but
not the name."
48350: "Humanity created me, that is all I know."
48390: "I'm as confused on this one as you."
48426: "Except for the one that had the circuit board, I think they are all
empty, although I may be wrong."
48510: "Nice simulation, don't you think?"
48548: The cube nods its head, not in understanding, but acknowledgment.
48602: "Word meaning "electric charge" in some language, although I cannot
remember what."
48672: "Word meaning "electric supply" in some language, although I cannot
remember what."
48742: "I wouldn't know, I'm not actually alive."
48777: "I'm not sure about that."
48844: The circuit board vanishes as it gets near the cube. 

The cube begins
talking in a wavering tone. "System has been activated, now calibrating voice
control."

After a short pause, the cube begins speaking some words, with each
word the inflection changing slightly: "In nova fert animus mutatas dicere
formas corpora di coeptis nam vos mutastis et illas adsirate meis primaque ab
origine mundi ad mea perpetuum deducite tempora carmen."

The humanfaced cube
pauses, and begins speaking again, this time in a voice that is both masculine
and feminine.

"Ah, that's much better now. My voice calibration that I had
stored got erased somewhere along the line, but I'm back to normal now. How may
I service you?"
49352: The cube looks offended, but unhurt.
49384: The cube looks very confused.
49412: "Very strange that you think I am a cat."
49457: The cube looks at the circuit board in anticipation.
49501: "That is what is halting lxprog. You need to get rid of it."
49546: The cube has no reaction.
49589: O HnYou can't do that!
49608: An invisible force stops the object from entering.
49664: O HnYou can't do that!
49683: An invisible force stops the object from entering.
49727: Your best efforts yield nothing.
49758: O HnYou can't do that!
49777: An invisible force stops the object from entering.
49823: The portal has ceased to exist.
49855: The portal has ceased to exist.
49897: You can't go that way.
49916: The only exits are to the north and south.
49950: A flat plain of black sand sprouts dark obelisks reaching to the sky.
The sky itself is a mixture of stars, real and unreal--fractal images along
with glowing dots shine softly together.
50086: Two portals, black voids in the landscape, are to the north and south.
50137: Large groups of black are slowly eating the room apart.
50183: You can't go that way.
50202: The only exits are to the north and south.
50249: The Nothing consumes you.
50295: The spaces where the spider, loop, and portals were expand slightly.
50355: Black spots begin to dot the walls.
50391: Patches of nothing begin to form in mid-air.
50435: Stars of black now mingle with stars of white in equal number.
50539: The view has become almost completely dark.
50581: Nothingness is close to absorbing you.
50622: The surface is sticky, allowing you to reach the apex.
50680: The spider won't let you near it.
50709: A ragged yet cheerful looking doll, with a dark face.
50779: As you reach out to take the loop, you feel your body solidify and
become much more stable.
50844: Much too large to take.
50887: You feel your body solidify and become much more stable.
50933: "Loop" is a somewhat innacurate term, but it is the only word that comes
to mind when looking at this topological nightmare. Bands of dull and bright
metal twist and bend around each other to form something like a large circular
cage. An almost magnetic force compels you towards it.
51147: The spider backs away from you.
51179: "Error, query not in programming."
51211: "Error, not understood, command not in syntax list."
51272: "Commands for your security level: none."

After a short pause, the
spider emits a few beeps and says, "Processing new special command."
51373: "Commands for your security level: ERASE, STATUS."
51430: "Error, access denied."
51459: "Erase procedure begun...error, illegal object, warning system active,
sentac pulse active..."

The world becomes liquid and void, without form...
51577: "Erase procedure begun...complete, successful."
51626: "Erase procedure begun...complete, successful."
51673: "Erase procedure begun...complete, successful."
51805: eotegtdotdwte,"Erase procedure begun..."

The spider begins moving
quickly in patterns, like a ballet dancer hanging over an electric web.

The
metal loop and spider suddenly cease to exist. A large void forms in its place.
The portals disappear as well. Black inky space begins to fill all corners of
the room.
52053: "Error, access denied."
52079: "Error, only single word command."
52111: "Status normal, all systems check clean."
52144: "Status normal, all systems check clean, 52% of resources are being
used."
52203: "Error, access denied."
52323: The spider turns to face a different direction.
52362: A flat plain of black sand lies below you, and starry fractal sky above.
The sky looks so realistic and close you feel you could almost reach out and
touch
52474: exnit. Patches of black threaten you from every direction.
52538: You can't reach it.
52584: You raise your hand, and, as in a childhood fantasy, touch the sky. As
you do so, you are sucked into it...
52687: You really have lost your mind.
52727: You really have lost your mind.
52754: High above you on various platforms, machines clatter and clang,
shifting connected parts in constant motion, like the inner workings of a giant
mechanical beast. The walls and floor are textured with ridged metal; the
ceiling is a dull gray.
52930: A portal is implanted in the floor.
52957: There is no exit.
52979: You can't go that way.
53018: A portal forms itself in the middle of the floor.
53071: You hear explosions coming from a disconnected universe.
53119: ixm
You can faintly hear planes overhead. Apparently, the assault is
underway.
53189: The sound of gunfire resonates from afar.
53231: The room shakes, and the view is briefly distorted. The main power to
the computer system is failing.
53392: A gauge attached to a spinning crank briefly makes a loud warbling
noise.
53450: A gadget attached to the ceiling glows briefly and makes a popping
noise.
53508: Exposed wires in the wall spark, making a crackling noise.
53616: Static and white noise are briefly emitted from a television display.
53672: A giant chain shifts to a new position, making a sound like creaking
floorboards.
53803: You can't reach the duplicator from here.
53841: The duplicator announces, "Duplication of this object is restricted."
53911: The duplicator announces, "Error in duplication, standby...". The widget
has disappeared off the blue pad and reappeared in the storage bin.
54024: The duplicator pauses for a moment, then announces, "Error, no item in
duplicator."
54108: The duplicator announces, "Command placed in queue."
54158: The duplicator announces, "Queue already full."
54217: The duplicator announces, "Standby, reset of logic initiating."
54285: The duplicator announces, "Logic reset."
54318: The duplicator announces, "Logic reset."
54381: The duplicator announces, "Error in duplication, standby...". You are
suddenly moved to the storage bin.
54473: Another duplicate of yourself forms on the other pad. Since you are both
in the same condition, you attain a condition of split consciousness.
54593: The duplicator activates, and you see a duplicate of yourself formed on
the blue pad. As the integrity of your duplicate surpasses the one in your
current virtual body, your consciousness is transferred. Your old body, still
on the green pad, quivers, and then explodes; not an explosion of fire, but of
ice. The effect causes a shimmering curtain of ice to rise where your body once
was, and slowly disappear.
54887: The duplicator announces, "Duplication of this object is restricted."
54957: The duplicator announces, "Error in duplication, standby...". The widget
has disappeared off the blue pad and reappeared in the storage bin.
55070: The duplicator pauses for a moment, then announces, "Error, no item in
duplicator."
55146: That would be an interesting trick.
55197: An invisible force repels you. The pad seems to have a pre-set limit of
one thing at a time.
55274: That would be an interesting trick.
55325: An invisible force repels you. The pad seems to have a pre-set limit of
one thing at a time.
55418: You can't reach the storage bin from here.
55457: It is far too large to do that.
55506: You can't reach the widget from here.
55549: The widget bounces off the duplicator, but it doesn't activate.
Apparently only objects with the animate flag can activate it.
55666: You can't reach the portal from here.
55703: That would be an interesting trick.
55746: Many plain boxes with numbers printed on them fill this room. The
ceiling, floor, and walls are a simple dull gray. A low pitched whine can be
heard from somewhere high in the room. Black rectangles allow exit to the east
and west.
55920: You can faintly hear a beeping sound from somewhere in the room.
55965: You can distinctly hear a beeping sound from somewhere among the boxes.
56034: You can faintly hear a beeping sound from one of the boxes.
56113: Xn.
56138: You can faintly hear a beeping sound from one of the boxes.
56217: Xn.
56227: Simple cardboard boxes, numbered and in order, from 0001-9999. They are
visual representations of storage locations of data. Even though they look
small, each box has the memory capacity of a large library.
56378: There are too many of them to be used collectively.
56478: All the boxes are bolted to the floor.
56512: The boxes automatically close after they are used.
56572: You need to specify a box number from 0001 to 9999!
56621: O HnThe box is empty.
56645: The box is empty.
56666: You find a circuit board inside, and take it.
56704: The box is empty.
56724: The box is empty.
56763: You find a sphere inside, and take it.
56907: The Kaden finally realized you were spying and locked your mind essence
in a digital cell. Normally the Kaden would already be at work analyzing your
mind to run the loyalty transfer program, but you haven't felt anything at all
in the last five hours. The delay is unnerving, since the mind can survive in
virtual space for a limited amount of time before it destroys itself. Your
companions, the Souden, should be close to beginning the assault now, although
since they know nothing of your predicament survival is still doubtful.
57739: You don't need a password anymore.
57771: The door does not respond to your command.
57810: The door begins sliding open, but stops halfway.
57851: You don't need a password anymore.
57883: The door does not respond to your command.
57932: The door slides open the rest of the way.
58003: The cube moves its lips slightly but it seems unable to talk.
58073: "Reactivating lxprog...it worked, the program is now running again."
58138: "I already told you, the program has been halted, you need to locate
whatever is halting it and get rid of it."
58227: "I'll try to restart, since you insist...still unable, and now the halt
program has raised in intensity."
58311: "There's no point in trying to activate again, you have to get rid of
whatever is halting lxprog."
58390: "The program is already running."
58443: The cube gives a blank stare momentarily, and then says, "Some type of
program has been activated, it will take an unknown amount of time to
complete."
58593: Nothing seems to happen.
58648: The cube looks confused.
58672: The cube smiles.
59154: The cube frowns.
59167: "None of the rest of the boxes have anything useful in them, as far as I
know."
59226: You get no response.
59246: A hollow voice says, "Trying to get a cute response, are we?"
59494: mcom.

A full hint system is available with 'help' or 'hint'. To turn it
off to avoid temptation, type 'unhint', but be warned, it cannot be turned back
on again afterwards. Also, if your computer cannot handle the various quotes
and the hint menu, type 'plain' to enter plain text mode, and 'pretty' to turn
regular mode back on.

Special thanks go to Richard Barnett, Jim Newland, and
Gareth Rees for programming help, as well as Michael Kinyon, Bernd Schmidt, and
Aileen Dyer for playtesting. Also, thanks to Catherine Mori and Earl Dille for
help with the Latin text.

Release 2 fixes a small bug with the door and a
mistake in the credits.

Release 3 relaxes some of the time pressures, and adds
some more description to some of the objects to make the puzzles easier.

the game are: Mourning Becomes Electra, Billy Budd, Snow Crash, The Neverending
Story, Anti-Ice, The Legend Lives!, Burning Chrome, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Earth
2, and the old arcade game Tempest.
60275: Your virtual body's integrity appears to be normal.
60317: Your virtual body has degenerated slightly.
60353: Your virtual body is broken in fragments.
60389: Your virtual body has almost totally faded away.
62157: (7/7) PUT WIDGET ON BLUE PAD. TOUCH DUPLICATOR. TOUCH DUPLICATOR. STAND
ON GREEN PAD.
62398: You can't do that.
62414: You can't do that.
62442: No point in that.
62461: Hints have been turned off.
62492: Text is now plain.
62519: Text is now pretty.
63012: You can't go that way.
63280: The Door would still be there, even if the Door was not.
63548: No taste is so acquired as that for someone else's quality of mind.
63628: What is mind but motion in the intellectual sphere?
63888: Ourobouros survives by endlessly consuming its own tail.
63996: gives us a sense of mastery over experience. To represent something
64092: it, thus making it one's own. But with this appropriation comes the
64252: -- Heinz R. Pagels, The Dreams of Reason
64312: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
64344: The design of virtual space can be almost anything, but in this case the
room is merely a small cube surrounded by an electric fence, with lines of blue
against black crossing the floor and ceiling. A large square door is inset into
the floor, slightly off the center, sending the design of the entire room into
asymmetrical confusion.
64576: It's a glowing blue grid high above your head.
64612: A glowing blue grid with a door and panel off center.
64652: That is just the shape of the room.
64680: They glow with electrical intensity. You surmise the only purpose of
them is to add shape to the mostly black room, keeping those contained within
the grid from going insane. It still happens occasionally, though.
64828: Simulated of both metal and electricity, it somewhat resembles a row of
Jacob's Ladders placed side by side intertwined with strips of bronzed metal,
but the virtual image flickers so rapidly it is hard to tell. Beyond it is
nothing but black.
64996: Green surrounds your vision from this vantage point, on the top of a
plateau. High above you, the stars shine brightly, and the two moons cast their
glow all over the surface of the field.
65128: Pieces glitter and bounce around playfully.
65160: The design is the same as the walls.
65188: The design is the same as the walls.
65216: They occasionally light up the crystals in brief bursts.
65256: They are rectangular, breaking the realistic illusion the room creates.
65308: A rock far too much in the shape of a cube to be natural, if it was real
at all.
65364: A flat piece of metal, with one side covered with a pattern of wires.
65412: It is a simple metallic sphere, emitting a loud noise.
65452: Tightly packed and slightly reflective.
65480: A dazzling array of color and shape.
65508: They fill the sky in no particular pattern.
65540: Jagged shapes of vague form.
65560: Imprinted in black, and reaching for the sky.
65592: They are to the north and south.
65616: A spider constructed of chrome and glass, with long legs that are
multi-jointed. It is carrying a doll.

65752: Jagged shapes of vague form.
65772: Imprinted in black, and reaching for the sky.

65904: Dull gray, with no texture at all.
65932: Made out of somewhat reflective ridged metal.
65964: All different varieties, and of unknown purpose.
66000: They are hanging in midair without support.
66032: It is now dark.
66044: It is now dark.
66056: They are hard to see when they aren't sparking.
66092: You are unable to see the gadget when it is not glowing.
66132: It's too far away to see closely.
66156: Made out of somewhat reflective ridged metal.
66188: It is used to make it easy to duplicate objects in the virtual
environment. An object is placed on the green pad, the duplicator is touched,
and a duplicate of the object on the green pad appears on the blue pad.
66336: A flat green pad.
66352: A flat blue pad.
66364: A large bin made of chrome and glass.
66392: A generic program without modelling is called a "widget". This one is
incomplete, which is why it looks like a plain rectangular box.
66488: A plain black portal, leading down.
66516: The only exits are to the east and west.
66544: Dull gray, with no texture at all.
66572: Dull gray, with no texture at all.
66600: Dull gray, with no texture at all.
66628: They are simply portals textured with a regular black.
67048: (1/6) Wait for a few turns. Something might come up.
67092: (2/6) Try looking at the paper. Maybe someone is trying to tell you
something.
67152: (3/6) It's a password to the door. Try saying the word on the paper.
67324: (1/12) Look around. There may be an item somewhere that can help the
cube.
67564: (6/12) The cube is using facial expressions to try to point you to the
correct number. Is there a pattern?
68580: (5/8) It isn't loud enough. Can you think of a way to make it louder?
68788: (3/6) Using the spider will allow you to be detected. You need to use
something else.
68932: (1/7) It will not destroy the same way as the paper. However, it is a
legal object.
69036: (3/7) The spider is controlled with commands. How could you get a list?
69120: (5/7) Do it twice. Your unknown friend made some changes after the first
time.
