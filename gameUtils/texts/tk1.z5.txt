41596: Nothing is on sale.
41642: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
41680: Time passes.
41696: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
41795: Surely mom told you not to play with broken glass.
41859: It begins to occur to you that the ceiling is moving... DOWNWARD!  You'd
better find a way out pretty soon.
41949: The ceiling slowly proceeds downward, making it a bit more uncomfortable
around here.  You have perhaps no more than five minutes.
42152: As the ceiling drops more, the glass tube, which is standing upright in
the hole in the floor, creaks under the pressure between the floor and ceiling.
 In a few seconds, the glass shatters, and the piece of paper falls to the
floor.
42317: You hear a sound of breaking glass come from the corridor.
42368: You'd better get out of here soon!  A couple more minutes and you'll be
a spot on the floor!
42445: The cold rock ceiling forces you to the floor as it descends more.  You
struggle to find some hiding place, but it is a futile attempt.  The ceiling
turns you into a pancake.
42643: There's some sort of panel on the wall nearby.
42678: A brass panel is on the wall nearby, with lettered buttons on it.
42735: It seems to be a panel with some buttons, but you can't quite see due to
the excess dust covering the panel.
42979: It's already clean enough.
43010: The panel is too dusty to make out any of the buttons.
43066: BLEEP!  A green light turns on, and the floor beneath you opens up!  You
fall down a chute, and the landing is quite harsh.
43166: A frustrating beep is emitted from the panel.
43207: The panel is too dusty to see much.
43296: The panel is too dusty to make out any of the buttons.
43536: The glass tube is in the hole, standing straight up.
43596: Why?
43650: The ceiling has gotten too low!
43772: Inside it is a piece of paper, rolled up.
43839: It is completely seamless.
44019: It's rolled up inside the glass tube.
44048: It simply reads, "SZHXO".
44185: The water has gotten too deep and the current from the duct prevents you
from closing the door.
44283: The door is too hard to reach now that you're floating above it.
44360: As you open the door, water rushes at high speed through the doorway,
lifting you and smashing you against a wall.  You fall unconscious, and drown
to death.
44555: Water pours into the armory from the well room as you open the door.
44695: You close the door, making the water build up in here more rapidly.
44744: You close the door, cutting off the water flow from the well room.
44855: This steel ball is much too heavy to walk around with.
44922: You're in no position to worry about taking or dropping anything other
than the heavy steel ball in your hands.
45002: You're losing your grip...
45113: It looks extremely heavy.
45143: Try pushing it a certain direction.
45207: You need to be empty-handed before carrying this heavy thing!
45319: It's very heavy, and you're not sure how long you can hold it!
45395: You drop the steel ball and chain to the floor.
45436: The ball rolls over the stone floor, making a quiet grating sound.
45498: The windshield is too wide to fit through the doorway.
45728: What a way to die!
45809: The ball and chain sit in the tire, stopping the water from pouring
through the hole.
46001: What was the point of that?
46022: You drop the ball and chain onto the tire.
46343: You grab a hold of it and prepare to drag it along with you.
46395: The clothes are too ubiquitous to gather and take with you.
46447: The toy rattles a little as you pick it up.
46483: A rattling sound is heard as you drop the baby's toy to the ground.
46557: Maybe you should put it in something, or wipe it on something.
46621: You wipe the steak against the battery, getting some acid on it.
46668: That wouldn't be useful.
46695: There's a dead man-eating plant here.
46726: You see a huge man-eating plant here!
46835: I'd be pretty careful if I were you.
46864: The plant is dead, now nothing more than a lifeless pile of greenery.
46953: It opens its mouth and gobbles up the steak quickly.
46999: The plant shudders for a moment, goes into a brief convulsion,
collapses.  It appears to be quite dead.
47105: Let's try not throwing things at the animals!  You succeed in angering
the plant by throwing things at it.  It descends towards you and swallows you
whole.  Definitely not fun.
47433: Hmfilling up the room.
47513: You hear the armory door creak as the water pressure tests its strength.
 A brief moment later, the door crashes down, and water comes rushing at you,
throwing you against a wall and knocking you unconscious.  Needless to say, you
never wake up.
47699: Your feet are a little chilled as the water swishes around your ankles.
47755: The water raises more, up to your calves.
47858: You'd better get out of this room like now!  You start treading water as
the water level raises more, starting to push you to the ceiling.
47957: You start treading water as the water gets higher.  The cool water
starts lifting you up, towards the hole in the ceiling.
48054: Better evacuate this room and head to the well really soon!  You're
going to find it very hard to swim there when this place is full of water.
48155: Looking up, you see the hole in the ceiling coming closer as the water
raises you up towards it more.
48241: You were warned!  The water reaches the ceiling, and the current coming
from the duct makes it extra hard for you to swim to the well in time.  You die
a very watery death.
48364: When you get close enough to the hole, you grab onto the edges of it and
pull yourself out of the well.  Whew!
48471: Just wait for the water to take you there.
48507: The opening in the ceiling is much too high up for you to access it.
48718: Mmm, appetizing!
48791: It's a bit too raw for your taste.
48835: That would get you nowhere.
48941: Looking down into the hole, you see darkness.
48983: It's not big enough for you to fit through.
49021: It's too dark to see anything down there.
49367: You climb back out of the overflowing well.
49398: You can only go east.
49431: As you walk down the path towards a nearby meadow, everything starts to
waver.  Your surroundings shimmer and fade, and after a moment, you find
yourself back home in your room.  You shrug it all off as a drunk episode, and
go to sleep.

Thanks for playing Time-Killer #1: Claustrophobia.  These are
just short games so I can practice making challenging puzzles.  Watch for more!
49718: You were just walking down the street, minding your own business, when a
man in a cape passed by you.  He turned to face you, your heart skipping a beat
as the sound of his feet turning on the street echoed in your ears.  Then there
was a sharp pain in the back of your head, and everything went black...
50183: You can't type on that.
50216: Now using metric system.
50245: No longer using metric system.
50268: Either turn it on or off.
50290: You can't do that.

Try "metric on/off" for
British/American measuring systems.
50456: You can't go that way.
50524: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
50556: As good-looking as ever.
50604: Just some shards of broken glass.
50628: Pieces of glass lie scattered here on the floor.
50772: A narrow corridor heads north, and that seems to be the only exit from
here.
50898: The corridor is actually a dead end, so you can only go back to the
round room.
51074: There's another room to the east.
51376: It has a few holes and is cracked quite badly in one part.
51424: Tattered old clothes: shirts, pants, socks.
51456: A scratched-up old piece of silverware.
51484: It's a small baby's toy that rattles when shaken.
51552: Corrosion covers the posts, and there's a long crack down the side of
the battery, with battery acid coming out.
51632: Battery acid slowly leaks from the battery.
51698: You wonder what it's doing here.
51858: To the east is a ladder leading down to the ground.
