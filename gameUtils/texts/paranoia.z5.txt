14149: Nothing to do!
14184: o. You have won
14268: It is now pitch dark in here!
14295: I beg your pardon?
14359: Sorry, that can't be corrected.
14388: Think nothing of it.
14441: As good-looking as ever.
14473: You can hardly repeat that.
14498: You can't begin with a comma.

14641: You can't see any such thing.
14677: You aren't holding that!
14719: I'm not sure what "
14771: That's not a verb I recognise.

14918: Nothing to do!
14935: There are none at all available!
15845: Please answer yes or no.

19195: You find nothing of interest.
19231: But it's dark.
19322: You find nothing of interest.
20450: . Not bad.
20468: That was a rhetorical question.

20865: Quite.
20934: You achieve nothing by this.
21022: You wave, feeling foolish.
21172: You are unable to.
21191: Nothing obvious happens.
21241: That's not a direction.
21264: Not that way you can't.
21296: Keep your hands to yourself.
21321: You achieve nothing by this.
21354: Futile.
21383: You talk to yourself a while.

45184: Clone:
45757: Step 5: Terminate the briefing.
45830: You have been hit!
45893: You zapped the little bastard!
45934: You wasted it! Good shooting!
45981: Damn! You missed!
46233: His shot just missed.
48938: Type 'help' for a list of valid commands.
49128: Score:
49136: Moves:
49144: Time:
49152: You can't go that way.
49396: [Your interpreter does not provide "undo". Sorry!]
49484: Please give one of the answers above.
49512: [You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
49548: [Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
49588: "Oops" can only correct a single word.
49616: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
49648: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
49708: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
49752: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.

49876: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
49912: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
49948: You excepted something not included anyway!
49980: You can only do that to something animate.
50012: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
50060: I didn't understand the way that finished.
50092: Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which exactly?
50244: Are you sure you want to restart?
50268: The game file has verified as intact.

50616: is now in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gives long
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
50712: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).
50796: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
50884: Darkness, noun. An absence of light to see by.
50972: This dangerous act would achieve little.
51000: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
51032: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
51064: Digging would achieve nothing here.
51092: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
51120: You would achieve nothing by this.
51144: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
51172: But there's no water here to carry.
51200: Real adventurers do not use such language.
51232: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
51260: There's not enough water to swim in.
51288: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
51316: That would be less than courteous.
51340: Is that the best you can think of?
51364: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
51404: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
51436: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
51522: Very occasionally during this adventure, you will be given a choice of
things to do. Always choose the least dangerous option. Continue doing this
until you win. At times you will use a skill or engage in combat and will be
informed of the outcome. These sections will be self explanatory. There are a
few other commands you can use -- type 'help' to find out about them.
51786: As Philo-R-DMD, you will die several times during the adventure. A new
clone will be activated to take the place of the one that died, in a different
location. The new Philo-R will usually have to retrace some of the old
Philo-R's path; hopefully he won't make the same mistakes as his predecessor.
52008: Simply complete the mission before expending all six of your clones.
Remember... stay alert, and keep your laser handy.
52096: Thank you for your request, Troubleshooter. Accessing archives...
52302: on a Vax 11/780 by Tim Lister, which is how I got hold of it. Just for
kicks (and the programming practice) I ported it to Inform.
52402: Note for all you IF fans: it's not very interactive. It's not a proper
IF game. It beats up the Inform parser in a dark alley. But it will make you
appreciate all the other IF games more.
54272: That is an unauthorized command, Troubleshooter.
54308: That is another unauthorized command, Troubleshooter.
54348: That is yet another unauthorized command. Are you up to this mission,
Troubleshooter? You can tell me. The computer is your friend.
54444: Yet another unauthorized command! I am beginning to suspect you are a
mutant commie traitor intent on sabotaging the computer.
54532: You hear a loud metallic voice. "Attention! computer sabotage in
progress!" Before you can even type "undo", 13 kilbots glide around the corner
and blast you into component atoms.
55222: Leave the game 

If you have any questions about any of the commands,
please don't hesitate to ask. The computer is your friend.
55320: "Congratulations, Troubleshooter. You have successfully activated the
Secret Self-Incrimination Debugging Command, and uncovered one more commie
mutant traitor."

While you wonder who the computer is referring to, hidden
lasers dice you into convenient bite size pieces, which a service bot then
carries off to the food vats.
55552: "That is an A-1 ULTRAVIOLET ONLY command".
55596: "ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE VERIFIED". A giant electrode descends from the
ceiling and you are engulfed in a pale blue dematerialization beam.

You appear
in what looks like a maze of twisty little passages, all alike. On looking
around, you notice a little dwarf in the room. He seems to be in the process of
throwing an axe at somebody behind you.

THUD!
55864: Oh dear. You seem to be out of clones.
55996: You wake up face down on the red and pink checked E-Z-Kleen linoleum
floor. You recognise the pattern, it's the type preferred in the internal
security briefing cells. When you finally look around you, you see that you are
alone in a large mission briefing room.
56180: "Greetings," says the kindly Internal Security self incrimination expert
who meets you at the door, "How are we doing today?"  He offers you a doughnut
and coffee and asks what brings you here. This doesn't seem so bad, so you tell
him that you have come to confess some possible security lapses. He smiles
knowingly, deftly catching your coffee as you slump to the floor. "Nothing to
be alarmed about; it's just the truth serum," he says, dragging you back into a
discussion room.

The next five hours are a dim haze, but you can recall
snatches of conversation about your secret society, your mutant power, and your
somewhat paranoid distrust of The Computer. This should explain why you are
hogtied and moving slowly down the conveyer belt towards the meat processing
unit in Food Services.
56740: You walk to the nearest Computer terminal and request more information
about Christmas. The Computer says, "That is an A-1 ULTRAVIOLET ONLY IMMEDIATE
TERMINATION classified topic. What is your clearance please, Troubleshooter?"
56928: You give your correct clearance.
56952: You lie and claim Ultraviolet clearance.
56984: "That is classified information, Troubleshooter, thank you for your
inquiry. Please report to an Internal Security self incrimination station as
soon as possible."
57292: In less than a minute an infrared arrives carrying a white bundle. He
asks you to sign for it, then hands it to you and stands back, well outside of
a fragmentation grenade's blast radius.
57424: You open the package and put on the uniform.
57456: You finally come to your senses and run for it.
57490: The uniform definitely makes you look snappy and pert. It really looks
impressive, and even has the new lopsided lapel fashion that you admire so
much. What's more, citizens of all ranks come to obsequious attention as you
walk past. This isn't so bad being an Ultraviolet. You could probably come to
like it, given time.

The beeping computer terminal interrupts your musings.
57758: The corridor lights dim and are replaced by red battle lamps as the
Security Breach alarms howl all around you. You run headlong down the corridor
and desperately windmill around a corner, only to collide with a squad of 12
Blue clearance Vulture squadron soldiers. "Stop, Slime Face," shouts the
commander, "or there won't be enough of you left for a tissue sample." "All
right, soldiers, stuff the greasy traitor into the uniform," he orders, waving
the business end of his blue laser scant inches from your nose. With his other
hand he shakes open a white bundle to reveal a pristine new Ultraviolet
citizen's uniform. One of the Vulture squadron Troubleshooters grabs you by the
neck in the exotic and very painful Vulture Clamp(tm) death grip (you saw a
special about it on the Teela O'Malley show), while the rest tear off your
clothes and force you into the Ultraviolet uniform. The moment you are dressed
they step clear and stand at attention.

"Thank you for your cooperation, sir,"
says the steely eyed leader of the Vulture Squad. "We will be going about our
business now." With perfect timing the Vultures wheel smartly and goosestep
down the corridor. Special Note: don't make the mistake of assuming that your
skills have improved any because of the uniform; you're only a Red
Troubleshooter traitorously posing as an Ultraviolet, and don't you forget it!
Suddenly, a computer terminal comes to life beside you.
58770: "Now, about your question, citizen. Christmas was an old world marketing
ploy to induce lower clearance citizens to purchase vast quantities of goods,
thus accumulation a large amount of credit under the control of a single class
of citizen known as Retailers. The strategy used is to imply that all good
citizens give gifts during Christmas, thus if one wishes to be a valuable
member of society one must also give gifts during Christmas. More valuable
gifts make one a more valuable member, and thus did the Retailers come to
control a disproportionate amount of the currency. In this way Christmas
eventually caused the collapse of the old world. Understandably, Christmas has
been declared a treasonable practice in Alpha Complex. Thank you for your
inquiry."

You continue on your way to GDH7-beta.
59336: As you walk toward the tubecar that will take you to GDH7-beta, you pass
one of the bright blue and orange Internal Security self incrimination
stations. Inside, you can see an IS agent cheerfully greet an infrared citizen
and then lead him at gunpoint into one of the rubber lined discussion rooms.
59548: You decide to stop here and chat, as ordered by The Computer.
59592: You just continue blithely on past.
59620: You stroll briskly down the corridor, up a ladder, across an unrailed
catwalk, under a perilously swinging blast door in urgent need of repair, and
into tubecar grand central. This is the bustling hub of Alpha Complex tubecar
transportation. Before you spreads a spaghetti maze of magnalift tube tracks
and linear accelerators. You bravely study the specially enhanced 3-D tube
route map; you wouldn't be the first Troubleshooter to take a fast tube ride to
nowhere.
59948: You decide to ask The Computer about Christmas using a nearby terminal.
60000: You think you have the route worked out, so you'll board a tube train.
60052: You nervously select a tubecar and step aboard.
60086: You just caught a purple line tubecar.
60116: You just caught a brown line tubecar.
60144: The printing on the folder says "Experimental Self Briefing." You open
it and begin to read the following:
60224: Step 1: Compel the briefing subject to attend the briefing.
60408: Step 2: Inform the briefing subject that the briefing has begun.
60456: ATTENTION: THE BRIEFING HAS BEGUN.
60508: Step 3: Present the briefing material to the briefing subject.
60554: GREETINGS TROUBLESHOOTER.

        YOU HAVE BEEN SPECIALLY SELECTED TO
SINGLEHANDEDLY WIPE OUT A 
        DEN OF TRAITOROUS CHRISTMAS ACTIVITY. YOUR
MISSION IS TO GO TO 
        GOODS DISTRIBUTION HALL 7-BETA AND ASSESS ANY
CHRISTMAS ACTIVITY 
        YOU FIND THERE. YOU ARE TO INFILTRATE THESE
CHRISTMAS CELEBRANTS, 
        LOCATE THEIR RINGLEADER, AN UNKNOWN MASTER
RETAILER, AND BRING 
        HIM BACK FOR EXECUTION AND TRIAL. THANK YOU. THE
COMPUTER IS 
        YOUR FRIEND.
61128: Step 4: Sign the briefing subject's briefing release form to indicate
that the briefing subject has completed the briefing.
61216: ATTENTION: PLEASE SIGN YOUR BRIEFING RELEASE FORM.
61288: ATTENTION: THE BRIEFING IS TERMINATED.
61348: You walk to the door and hold your signed briefing release form up to
the plexiglass window. A guard scrutinises it for a moment and then slides back
the megabolts holding the door shut. You are now free to continue the mission.
61504: You wish to ask The Computer for more information about Christmas.
61552: You have decided to go directly to Goods Distribution Hall 7-beta.
61604: You walk up to the door and push the button labelled "push to exit."
Within seconds a surly looking guard shoves his face into the small plexiglass
window. You can see his mouth forming words but you can't hear any of them. You
just stare at him blankly for a few moments until he points down to a speaker
on your side of the door. When you put your ear to it you can barely hear him
say, "Let's see your briefing release form, bud. You aren't getting out of here
without it."
61936: You sit down at the table and read the Orange packet.
61976: You stare around the room some more.
62002: You step into the shiny plasteel tubecar, wondering why the shape has
always reminded you of bullets. The car shoots forward the instant your feet
touch the slippery gray floor, pinning you immobile against the back wall as
the tubecar careens toward GDH7-beta. Your only solace is the knowledge that it
could be worse, much worse.

Before too long the car comes to a stop. You can
see signs for GDH7-beta through the window. With a little practice you discover
that you can crawl to the door and pull open the latch.
62368: You manage to pull yourself out of the tubecar and look around. Before
you is one of the most confusing things you have ever seen, a hallway that is
simultaneously both red and green clearance. If this is the result of Christmas
then it's easy to see the evils inherent in its practice. You are in the heart
of a large goods distribution centre. You can see all about you evidence of
traitorous secret society Christmas celebration; rubber faced robots whiz back
and forth selling toys to holiday shoppers, simul-plast wreaths hang from every
light fixture, while ahead in the shadows is a citizen wearing a huge red
synthetic flower.
62942: I got some real neat junk here. You don't wanna miss the big day
tommorrow, if you know what I mean." The robot opens its bag to show you a pile
of shoddy Troubleshooter dolls. It reaches in and pulls out one of them. "Look,
these Action Troubleshooter(tm) dolls are the neatest thing. This one's got
moveable arms and when you squeeze him, his little rifle squirts realistic
looking napalm. It's only 50 credits. Oh yeah, Merry Christmas."
63260: You decide to buy the doll.
63280: You shoot the robot.
63296: You ignore the robot and keep searching the hall.
63332: The doll is a good buy for fifty credits; it will make a fine Christmas
present for one of your friends. After the sale the robot rolls away. You can
use the doll later in combat. It works just like a cone rifle firing napalm,
except that occasionally it will explode and blow the user to smithereens. But
don't let that stop you.
63564: You whip out your laser and shoot the robot, but not before it squeezes
the toy at you. The squeeze toy has the same effect as a cone rifle firing
napalm, and the elfbot's armour has no effect against your laser.
63710: It missed you, but not by much!
63818: It tried to fire again, but the toy exploded and demolished it.
63946: You walk to the centre of the hall, ogling like an infrared fresh from
the clone vats. Towering before you is the most unearthly thing you have ever
seen, a green multi armed mutant horror hulking 15 feet above your head. Its
skeletal body is draped with hundreds of metallic strips (probably to negate
the effects of some insidious mutant power), and the entire hideous creature is
wrapped in a thousand blinking hazard lights. It's times like this when you
wish you'd had some training for this job. Luckily the creature doesn't take
notice of you but stands unmoving, as though waiting for a summons from its
dark lord, the Master Retailer.

WHAM! Suddenly you are struck from behind.
64428: Quickly you regain your balance, whirl and fire your laser into the
Ultraviolet citizen behind you. For a moment your heart leaps to your throat,
then you realise that he is indeed dead and you will be the only one filing a
report on this incident. Besides, he was participating in this traitorous
Christmas shopping, as is evident from the rain of shoddy toys falling all
around you. Another valorous deed done in the service of The Computer!
64736: You are standing over the body of a dead Ultraviolet citizen.
64780: You search the body, keeping an eye open for Internal Security.
64828: You run away like the cowardly dog you are.
64860: Oh no! you can't keep your balance. You're falling, falling head first
into the Christmas beast's gaping maw. It's a valiant struggle; you think you
are gone when its poisonous needles dig into your flesh, but with a heroic
effort you jerk a string of lights free and jam the live wires into the
creature's spine. The Christmas beast topples to the ground and begins to burn,
filling the area with a thick acrid smoke. It takes only a moment to compose
yourself, and then you are ready to continue your search for the Master
Retailer.
65342: j-beta. Suddenly, a net of laser beams spear out of the gloomy corners
of the hall, chopping you into teeny, weeny bite size pieces.
65436: You are searching Goods Distribution Hall 7-beta.
65476: You go to the nearest computer terminal and declare yourself a mutant.
"A mutant, he's a mutant," yells a previously unnoticed infrared who had been
looking over your shoulder. You easily gun him down, but not before a dozen
more citizens take notice and aim their weapons at you.
65672: You tell them that it was really only a bad joke.
65708: You want to fight it out, one against twelve.
65740: Golly, I never expected someone to pick this. I haven't even designed
the 12 citizens who are going to make a sponge out of you. Tell you what, I'll
give you a second chance.
65868: You change your mind and say it was only a bad joke.
65904: You REALLY want to shoot it out.
65932: Boy, you really can't take a hint!

They're closing in. Their trigger
fingers are twitching, they're about to shoot. This is your last chance.
66040: You tell them it was all just a bad joke.
66072: You are going to shoot.
66092: You can read the cold, sober hatred in their eyes (they really didn't
think it was funny), as they tighten the circle around you. One of them shoves
a blaster up your nose, but that doesn't hurt as much as the multi-gigawatt
carbonium tipped food drill in the small of your back. You spend the remaining
micro-seconds of your life wondering what you did wrong.
66344: Doesn't exist. Can't happen with computer version. Designed to catch
dice cheats.
66404: They don't think it's funny.
66584: You pay the 30 credits for the info.
66612: You would rather threaten him for the information.
66648: You ignore him and walk away.
66906: tep behind me and go through the door."

Behind the man is a reinforced
plasteel blast door. The centre of it has been buckled toward you in a manner
you only saw once before when you were field testing the rocket assist plasma
slingshot (you found it easily portable but prone to misfire). Luckily it isn't
buckled too far for you to make out the warning sign. WARNING!! Don't open this
door or the same thing will happen to you. Opening this door is a capital
offense. Do not do it. Not at all. This is not a joke.
67272: You use your Precognition mutant power on opening the door.
67316: You just go through the door anyway.
67344: You decide it's too dangerous and walk away.
67780: You pay the 30 credits.
67820: Finally it's your big chance to prove that you're as good a
troubleshooter as your previous clone. You walk briskly to mission briefing and
pick up your previous clone's personal effects and notepad. After reviewing the
notes you know what has to be done. You catch the purple line to Goods
Distribution Hall 7-beta and begin to search for the blast door.
68068: You release the megabolts on the blast door, then strain against it with
your awesome strength. Slowly the door creaks open. You bravely leap through
the opening and smack your head into the barrel of a 300 mm 'ultra shock' class
plasma cannon. It's dark in the barrel now, but just before your head got stuck
you can remember seeing a group of technicians anxiously watch you leap into
the room.
68344: You have found a sealed envelope on the body. You open it and
read:

"WARNING: Ultraviolet Clearance ONLY. DO NOT READ. Memo from
Chico-U-MRX4 to Harpo-U-MRX5. The planned takeover of the Troubleshooter
Training Course goes well, Comrade. Once we have trained the unwitting
bourgeois troubleshooters to work as communist dupes, the overthrow of Alpha
Complex will be unstoppable. My survey of the complex has convinced me that no
one suspects a thing; soon it will be too late for them to oppose the
revolution. The only thing that could possibly impede the people's revolution
would be someone alerting The Computer to our plans (for instance, some
enterprising Troubleshooter could tell The Computer that the communists have
liberated the Troubleshooter Training Course and plan to use it as a jumping
off point from which to undermine the stability of all Alpha Complex), but as
we both know, the capitalistic Troubleshooters would never serve the interests
of the proletariat above their own bourgeois desires. P.S. I'm doing some
Christmas shopping later today. Would you like me to pick you up
something?"

When you put down the memo you are overcome by that strange
deja-vu again. You see yourself talking privately with The Computer. You are
telling it all about the communists' plan, and then the scene shifts and you
see yourself showered with awards for foiling the insidious communist plot to
take over the complex.
69372: You rush off to the nearest computer terminal to expose the commies.
69420: You wander off to look for more evidence.
69450: "Oh master," you hear through the gun barrel, "where have you been? It
is time for the great Christmas gifting ceremony. You had better hurry and get
the costume on or the trainee may begin to suspect." For the second time today
you are forced to wear attire not of your own choosing. They zip the suit to
your chin just as you hear gunfire erupt behind you. "Oh no! Who left the door
open? The commies will get in. Quick, fire the laser cannon or we're all
doomed."

"Too late you capitalist swine, the people's revolutionary strike
force claims this cannon for the proletariat's valiant struggle against
oppression. Take that, you running dog imperialist lackey." ZAP, KAPOW."

Just
when you think that things couldn't get worse, "Aha, look what we have here,
the Master Retailer himself with his head caught in his own cannon. His death
will serve as a symbol of freedom for all Alpha Complex. Fire the cannon."
70112: "Congratulations, troubleshooter, you have successfully found the lair
of the Master Retailer and completed the Troubleshooter Training Course test
mission," a muffled voice tells you through the barrel. "Once we dislodge your
head from the barrel of the 'Ultra Shock' plasma cannon you can begin with the
training seminars, the first of which will concern the 100% accurate
identification and elimination of unregistered mutants. If you have any
objections please voice them now."
70452: You appreciate his courtesy and voice an objection.
70488: After your head is removed from the cannon, you register as a mutant.
70536: After your head is removed from the cannon, you go to the unregistered
mutant identification and elimination seminar.
70994: He shows you into a vast lecture hall filled with empty seats. There is
only one other student here, a Troubleshooter near the front row playing with
his Action Troubleshooter(tm) figure. "Find a seat and I will begin," says the
instructor.
71168: , head of mutant propaganda here at the training course. If you have any
questions about mutants please come to me. Today I will be talking about mutant
detection. Detecting mutants is very easy. One simply watches for certain tell
tale signs, such as the green scaly skin, the third arm growing from the
forehead, or other similar disfigurements so common with their kind. There are,
however, a few rare specimens that show no outward sign of their treason. This
has been a significant problem, so our researchers have been working on a
solution. I would like a volunteer to test this device," he says, holding up a
ray gun looking thing. "It is a mutant detection ray. This little button
detects for mutants, and this big button stuns them once they are discovered.
Who would like to volunteer for a test?" The Troubleshooter down the front
squirms deeper into his chair.
71776: You volunteer for the test.
71796: You duck behind a chair and hope the instructor doesn't notice you.
72096: grasping the opportunity to prove your worth to The Computer, you fire
the mutant detection ray at the Troubleshooter. A brilliant purple nimbus
instantly surrounds his body. You slip your finger to the large stun button and
he falls writhing to the floor. "Good shot," says the instructor as you hand
him the mutant detection gun, "I'll see that you get a commendation for this.
It seems you have the hang of mutant detection and elimination. You can go on
to the secret society infiltration class. I'll see that the little mutie gets
packaged for tomorrow's mutant dissection class."
72504: You breathe a sigh of relief as Plato-B-PHI picks on the other
Troubleshooter. "You down here in the front," says the instructor pointing at
the other Troubleshooter, "you'll make a good volunteer. Please step forward."
The Troubleshooter looks around with a `who me?' expression on his face, but
since he is the only one visible in the audience he figures his number is up.
He walks down to the podium clutching his Action Troubleshooter(tm) doll before
him like a weapon. "Here," says Plato-B-PHI, "take the mutant detection ray and
point it at the audience. If there are any mutants out there we'll know soon
enough." Suddenly your skin prickles with static electricity as a bright purple
nimbus surrounds your body. "Ha Ha, got one," says the instructor. "Stun him
before he gets away."
73076: His shot hits you. You feel numb all over.
73110: You just blew his head off. His lifeless hand drops the mutant detector
ray.
73168: You burnt a hole in the podium. He sights the mutant detector ray on
you.
73224: You stumble down the hallway of the Troubleshooter Training Course
looking for your next class. Up ahead you see one of the instructors waving to
you. When you get there he shakes your hand and says, "I am Jung-I-PSY. Welcome
to the secret society infiltration seminar. I hope you..." You don't catch the
rest of his greeting because you're paying too much attention to his handshake;
it is the strangest thing that has ever been done to your hand, sort of how it
would feel if you put a neuro whip in a high energy palm massage unit. It
doesn't take you long to learn what he is up to; you feel him briefly shake
your hand with the secret Illuminati handshake.
73692: You respond with the proper Illuminati code phrase, "Ewige Blumenkraft".
73748: You ignore this secret society contact.
73858: He turns to the large class already seated in the auditorium and says,
"You see, class, by simply using the correct hand shake you can identify the
member of any secret society. Please keep your weapons trained on him while I
call a guard.
74028: You run for it.
74040: You wait for the guard.
74060: You sit through a long lecture on how to recognise and infiltrate secret
societies, with an emphasis on mimicking secret handshakes. The basic theory,
which you realise to be sound from your Iluminati training, is that with the
proper handshake you can pass unnoticed in any secret society gathering. What's
more, the proper handshake will open doors faster than an 'ultra shock' plasma
cannon. You are certain that with the information you learn here you will
easily be promoted to the next level of your Illuminati secret society. The
lecture continues for three hours, during which you have the opportunity to
practice many different handshakes. Afterwards everyone is directed to attend
the graduation ceremony. Before you must go you have a little time to talk to
The Computer about, you know, certain topics.
74624: You go looking for a computer terminal.
74652: You go to the graduation ceremony immediately.
74684: You walk down to a semi-secluded part of the training course complex and
activate a computer terminal. "AT YOUR SERVICE" reads the computer screen.
74796: You register yourself as a mutant.
74820: You change your mind and go to the graduation ceremony.
74860: You want to chat about the commies.
75460: It is not in the interest of your continued survival to be asking about
such topics," says The Computer.
75536: You insist on talking about the communists.
75568: You change the subject.
75586: The Computer orders the entire Vulture squadron to terminate the
Troubleshooter Training Course. Unfortunately you too are terminated for
possessing classified information.

Don't act so innocent, we both know that
you are an Illuminatus which is in itself an act of treason.

Don't look to me
for sympathy.
75808: The tubecar shoots forward as you enter, slamming you back into a pile
of garbage. The front end rotates upward and you, the garbage and the garbage
disposal car shoot straight up out of Alpha Complex. One of the last things you
see is a small blue sphere slowly dwindling behind you. After you fail to
report in, you will be assumed dead.
76044: The instructor drags your inert body into a specimen detainment cage.
"He'll make a good subject for tomorrow's mutant dissection class," you hear.
76148: You put down the other Troubleshooter, and then wisely decide to drill a
few holes in the instructor as well; the only good witness is a dead witness.
You continue with the training course.
76280: You run for it, but you don't run far. Three hundred strange and exotic
weapons turn you into a freeze dried cloud of soot.
76368: You wisely wait until the instructor returns with a Blue Internal
Security guard. The guard leads you to an Internal Security self incrimination
station.
76476: You tell The Computer about:
76498: The commies who have infiltrated the Troubleshooter Training Course and
the
      impending People's Revolution.
76584: Something less dangerous.
76604: "Do not try to change the subject, Troubleshooter," says The Computer.
"It is a serious crime to ask about the communists. You will be terminated
immediately. Thank you for your inquiry. The Computer is your friend." Steel
bars drop to your left and right, trapping you here in the hallway. A spotlight
beams from the computer console to brilliantly illuminate you while the speaker
above your head rapidly repeats "Traitor, Traitor, Traitor." It doesn't take
long for a few guards to notice your predicament and come to finish you off.
77620: Then the instructor begins reading the names of the students who one by
one walk to the front of the auditorium and receive their diplomas. Soon it is
your turn, "Philo-R-DMD, graduating a master of mutant identification and
secret society infiltration." You walk up and receive your diploma from
Plato-B-PHI-
77844: , then return to your seat. There is another speech after the diplomas
are handed out, but it is cut short by by rapid fire laser bursts from the high
spirited graduating class. You are free to return to your barracks to wait,
trained and fully qualified, for your next mission. You also get that cherished
promotion from the Illuminati secret society. In a week you receive a detailed
Training Course bill totalling 1,523 credits.
78148: That familiar strange feeling of deja-vu envelops you again. It is hard
to say, but whatever is on the other side of the door does not seem to be
intended for you.
78264: You open the door and step through.
78292: You go looking for more information.
78320: In the centre of the room is a table and a single chair. There is an
Orange folder on the table top, but you can't make out the lettering on it.
78424: You sit down and read the folder.
78448: You leave the room.
