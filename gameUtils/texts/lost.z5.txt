"frog, again".
18157: You can hardly repeat that.
18420: You can't begin with a comma.
18481: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
18571: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
19535: I didn't understand that sentence.
19643: I didn't understand that number.
19674: You can't see any such thing.

19766: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
19806: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
19885: You excepted something not included anyway!
19923: You can only do that to something animate.
19960: That's not a verb I recognise.

great affection for, and have no real trouble in refraining from doing so.
30555: You bounce merrily on the spot a couple of times. What fun!
30603: Like a true native of Sacromys Pemcoangs, you have a tendency to
apologise far too many times.
30675: No matter how hard you try to concentrate, all you can see in your head
is a kingsize bar of chocolate.
30753: Sacromys Pemcoangs has been designated a smoke-free zone by the council.
30811: Hush! The people of Sacromys Pemcoangs have delicate ears, and do not
want to be subjected to such language!
30895: I say. Dashed frustrating, this game, what?
30934: That isn't on sale.

40801: You are carrying nothing.
40843: Taken.
40854: You are always self-possessed.
40972: You already have that.
41057: That isn't available.
41098: That's hardly portable.
41121: That's fixed in place.
41145: You're carrying too many things already.
41220: Already on the floor.
41241: You haven't got that.
41283: Dropped.
41301: It is unfortunately closed.
41326: But it isn't there now.
41345: Removed.
41426: You can't put something on top of itself.
41503: You lack the dexterity.
41580: Done.
41622: You need to be holding it before you can put it into something else.
41675: That can't contain things.
41700: Alas, it is closed.
41721: You'll need to take it off first.
41837: Done.
41878: That isn't in your possession.
41901: First pick that up.
42189: That's not something you can enter.
42257: You can only get into something on the floor.
42370: But you aren't in anything at the moment.

43579: That doesn't seem to fit the lock.
43633: That doesn't seem to be something you can lock.

44196: You can't wear that!
44217: You're not holding that!
44240: You're already wearing that!
44289: That's plainly inedible.
44322: Not bad.
44337: That was a rhetorical question.
44364: This dangerous act would achieve little.
44398: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
44434: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
44471: That seems unnecessary.
44494: Keep your mind on the game.
44519: What a good idea.
44538: You smell nothing unexpected.
44565: You hear nothing unexpected.
44590: You taste nothing unexpected.
44622: Keep your hands to yourself!
44647: If you think that'll help.
44668: You feel nothing unexpected.
44693: Digging would achieve nothing here.
44724: Cutting that up would achieve little.
44755: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
44788: You would achieve nothing by this.
44817: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
44850: But there's no water here to carry.
44881: Oh, don't apologise.
44903: Real adventurers do not use such language.
44938: Quite.
44949: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
44982: There's not enough water to swim in.
45013: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
45046: You can't usefully blow that.
45073: You achieve nothing by this.
45098: No, you can't set that.
45121: No, you can't set that to anything.
45152: You wave, feeling foolish.
45182: But you aren't holding that.
45246: It is fixed in place.
45267: You are unable to.
45286: That would be less than courteous.
45311: Nothing obvious happens.
45339: Is that the best you can think of?
45368: That's not a direction.
45387: Not that way you can't.
45415: Keep your hands to yourself.
45436: You achieve nothing by this.
45466: Futile.
45473: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
45521: You talk to yourself a while.
45544: This provokes no reaction.
45571: There is no reply.
45590: Nothing is on sale.
45609: Your singing is abominable.
45635: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
45672: Time passes.
45687: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
45829: Go where?
45880: That's not something you can follow.
49031: The rope is already tied to the crank on the well.
49206: The rope is already tied to the basket.
49329: Silk is hardly likely to agree to stand still while you tie her up,
unless she's deeply into bondage or something.
49450: It wouldn't be helpful to tie the rope to that.
49515: You'll have to turn the crank to get the dangling end of the rope up to
the top first.
49613: That would be extremely hazardous to your health.
49687: You retrieve the rope from the crank, and untie it from the basket.
49736: You retrieve the rope from the crank.
49794: You take the rope and untie it from the basket.
49952: You've never been much of a climber. Surely there's a less strenuous way
down?
50009: You'll be trying to pick yourself up by your bootlaces next.
50380: You slip the mint into your mouth, and let it dissolve. Delicious!
50434: Good manners suggest that you shouldn't just lick the mint to have a
taste of it - you should eat it or leave it.
50528: You don't need to buy the mints - you have an account here, which is
funded by the Secret Service.
50599: You don't need to.
50733: So many lovely items! But you've already had your share of sweets for
now.
50788: You can't see any mints here.
50816: You can only see one mint here (refer to it by the word 'mint').
50872: Spherical pepermint-flavoured sweets made of icing sugar. They look
delicious!
50984: You're already holding all of the available mints.
51021: Taken.
51033: As much as you like these mints, you wouldn't want to eat them all at
once - they'd make you sick.
51149: You'd have to be holding some mints in order to do that.
51202: Maybe it wouldn't be wise to give all them away at once.
51247: Maybe you ought to eat one.
51272: They don't smell unusual.
51341: You're not holding any mints at the moment.
51392: Dropped.
51447: You're not holding any mints.
51556: Dropped.
51627: Q. When you look around, there is no sign of the door, or that it was
ever there in the first place.
51725: But you haven't discovered what your mission is all about yet!
51956: You walk through the door, and let it swing closed. But when you look
behind you, there is no sign of a door, and this is not where you were
expecting to find yourself...
52399: He is busy writing and clearly hasn't seen you come in.
52445: He is trying to look dignified despite having difficulty balancing his
hat on his head.
52511: He is writing something undoubtedly important.
52562: He is waiting to answer any questions you may have.
52674: He leans forward and hands you a number of mints. "For luck," he
explains.
52886: glances at Daisy. "Now now, Mattie," he admonishes. "You know the rules
about bringing pets into work. You should take Daisy to see the statue in the
Village Centre or something."
53080: "Oh, by the way, the salesman may be willing to give you another
demonstration if you need it."
53151: "So, Mattie, what can I help you with?" he asks.
53209: yes widen in shock upon seeing Silk ooze magically into the room. In a
flash, he has dived behind his desk. "Get her out of here!" he hisses. "Lead
her to someone who cares enough about you to help! Er... and who won't wide
behind desks!"
53391: You only do that when you desperately want something, like a new jerkin
or a fresh pair of red shiny boots.
53471: Attack your boss? He can be infuriating sometimes but he doesn't deserve
physical violence.
53661: stares at you. "You haven't even left the office, and already you want
help! This won't do, Mattie - go out and try, first. If you get stuck, come
back to me."
53805: "That's what you have to find out!" says T.
53875: houghtfully. "Have you made a wish yet?"
53937: , "but I don't think he can help you in this mission."
53985: "The Reverend?" asks T. "He's always going on about his wretched spell
collection back at his cottage. Half of them are pretty useless anyway, by the
sound of things."
54117: thinks for a moment. "Digga's a bit of an oddity, all things considered.
He and the Reverend enjoy arguing with each other, it would seem, to the point
where everything else is sidelined. Listen to me! Calling Digga a 'he' when
I've no idea what sex he - oops, s/he - is at the moment. Anyway, despite
Digga's arrogance, s/he can be quite helpful at times."
54387: looks worried. "Silk? Mattie, you haven't led her here, have you?"
54447: "She's a very nervous sort, really," says T. "Always worried about what
the Reverend will say. But she makes a splendid cup of tea!"
54553: "Edna's a card, isn't she?" chuckles T. "She only deals in swaps,
though."
54623: "If you find any rope, you may want to use it to replace the rope that
was taken from the well."
54699: "Basket? I wonder if its big enough for you to fit inside."
54767: , "have a few sweets yourself. But remember that others in the village
may like them too."
54841: "Daisy the talking cow? She's probably the most mature resident of the
village, and can't stand bickering."
54955: eriously. "When it's ajar! Ha ha!" He chortles for a moment, before
noticing that you're not laughing. "Ahem. Yes. Well. It's a container, right?
So you may want to contain something within it."
55165: that you are referring to the metal crank on the well. "Oh, sorry, I see
what you mean know. The crank's there to be turned. If not by you, then by
someone else."
55291: "If you can't get a magic weaver of your own, you may be able to trick
the salesman into processing a spell for you," explains T.
55407: simply. "Or make a wish at the wishing well."
55499: knowingly. "I think she likes you too. Maybe you can involve her in the
mission somehow, if you get into difficulties."
55593: "The author? Pah! He's a complete nutter."
55635: "Don't say you've forgotten already, Mattie?" chuckles T. "Drew's gone
missing. You must find him, so that he can get back to making spells to
entertain the restless villagers."
55774: "That's classified information," says T.
55926: Wisher makes a lovely cup of tea, down at the Reverend's cottage."
55984: "Oh, he's currently flirting needlessly with one of our undercover
operatives in another office."
56066: Cashpound is very fond of his new magic weaver, you know," says T.
"Won't let anyone else near it."
56148: "Ah, the wretched spell collection the Reverend keeps going on about.
Most of the, as far as I can see are useless, but the strength one may come in
handy."
56268: "What, the damned spell that's causing all the fuss at the moment? Don't
worry about it, Mattie - it's not important."
56359: thinks for a moment. "I don't think that's relevant to the current
situation," he says eventually.
56595: "Yes, hello Mattie."
56623: tuts, folding his arms. "The mentality of some people today. I blame
that Cummings-Steen fellow, myself."
56704: frowns, not knowing what you are talking about. "Maybe you should just
ask me something," he says.
56785: frowns in concentration. "It's no good," he says eventually. "My
eyesight's not what it used to be. You'll have to talk to me rather than show
me things."
56954: "Here's your first hint, Mattie - try going west."
57000: "You'll have to ask me about a particular topic, I'm afraid," says T.
57201: oticing you for the first time, "there you are, Mattie."
57249: "Well, as you are probably aware, the people of Sacromys Pemcoangs are
getting very restless. Spells have been in very short supply of late, and
top-of-the-range Magic Weavers are being left idle."
57403: ontinues. "I have been looking into the problem, and it seems that we
are lacking in good Spellmakers. Many years ago there was a surplus, but one by
one they have all vanished. The latest to disappear is old Drew Tungshinach."
57601: tis responsible for the fabled ornithopter spell, and the much-praised
spell to create wild racing chariots. His disappearance cannot be tolerated
within our community. You must discover what has happened to him and ensure his
return so that he may entertain us further with his joyful sparkly spells."
57841: eans back in his chair, his briefing finished. "Go now, Mattie, and good
luck. And if you should need assistance on your quest, I am transferring to you
the magic hint seeker. Simply utter 'HINT' or 'HINTS' and we will open a secret
doorway for you to return here." He turns his attention back to the document he
was writing.
58305: Cashpound, would be most upset if you played with his Magic Weaver!"
58382: Cashpound. "It's only a background object."
58433: hat. He wouldn't be too happy if you started playing with it.
58482: The centre of Thurman street is bustling with pale-looking shoppers not
used to seeing the sunshine. What with the spell deficit, they've been forced
out of their homes in search of other things to do to pass the time. Your home
from home, the Sweet Shop, lies tantalisingly to the west, and the main cobbled
street runs from the south to the northeast. To the east, in the centre of the
village,
58806: Best to just leave the shoppers alone.
58850: Barnie's eyes light up. "Hi, Mattie!" he says loudly, shifting from one
foot to the other in excitement.
58929: Barnie, the incredibly sweet if slightly dim assistant, smiles at you
from behind the counter, eager to please.
59029: "See you!" calls out Barnie as you leave.
59246: Barnie giggles. "Oh, Mattie, you're so silly! The jar's nearer you than
me."
59365: turnbull told me not to leave the shop till he got back. Sorry."
59427: Barnie looks confused. "I don't think I can do that."
59536: Turnbull says you've got a good count... you can count good... a
count... or something."
59612: "Drew?" says Barnie, scratching his head. "I don't know him, Mattie."
59680: Turnbull's the greatest!" enthuses Barnie. "He's at some sweet
conversion... confersa... confence... big meeting with other sweet shop bosses
and stuff."
59805: "Oh, Mattie. That's a hard one!" exclaims Barnie earnestly, scratching
his head. "Don't know what to say."
59897: "They sure were making a racket when I was out there before," says
Barnie.
59969: Wisher," Barnie confides. "She makes nice tea and always gives me choccy
biccies."
60039: "Tilly's nice," grins Barnie. "She was here yesterday. Bought some
chocolates. Told me not to tell anyone." Barnie frowns. "That means I shouldn't
have told you... oops."
60172: Barnie looks puzzled. "Sorry," he says. "Don't know nothing about that."
60244: Barnie grins stupidly, still hopping from one foot to the other.
60350: turnbull told me not to leave the shop till he got back. Sorry."
60397: "Sure Mattie," giggles Barnie. "Whatever you say."
60445: Barnie wouldn't hurt a fly. There's no need to attack him.
60495: You plant a kiss on Barnie's cheek, and for a moment he turns away
shyly. Then, the moment forgotten, he grins at you again.
60628: Turnbull told me I'm not allowed to eat any of the stock... or the
sweets either..." Barnie's face creases into a frown for a moment, and then he
is back to being his bright, happy self.
60816: Turnbull, and he'll put in on your good count."
60882: Turnbull says," Barnie informs you. "Don't know what that means. But you
can take whatever sweets you want."
60965: Barnie grins. "I know this game, I know this game!" he cries happily,
then concentrates on the item you are offering. After a moment, he grins again.
"I know! That's
61102: So many lovely things! But you're on a mission.
61190: Still, perhaps that one jar of eight mints on the highest shelf wouldn't
hurt...
61270: So many sweets on so many shelves - Heaven must be like this!
61371: Much as you love sweets, you've never had the nerve, the strength or the
cash to get more than a few sweets at a time. Anyway, you're on a mission -
sweets will have to wait.
61590: The jar ought to be empty before you go putting tea in it.
61652: That's too big to fit into the jar.
61686: You mustn't ruin the flavour of the tea!
61723: Don't do that - you might find some use for it.
61762: The centre of Sacromys Pemcoangs; you can see the entire village from
here, although because of the laws against walking on the grass, you can only
follow the path stretching from east to west. A stone monument stands alongside
the path, depicting the founder of the community
61960: , but no one is paying it attention at the moment. A large crowd of
pale-faced citizens has gathered here, occasionally offering jeers or cries of
encouragement as they watch Digga and the Reverend arguing bitterly about
probably nothing at all.
62209: You concentrate on the argument.
62238: Digga, a respected member of the community, is something of an oddity.
Owing to a rather unfortunate accident caused by his/her Magic Weaver crashing
in the middle of reading a particularly potent spell, s/he now changes gender
with dizzying frequency. At the moment, Digga is
62551: Digga is here, slumped against the statue, sulking.
62595: Digga is here, slumped on the ground, sulking.
62636: She is currently in female form.
62661: He is currently in male form.
62750: Digga turns to you self-righteously. "What gives you the right to decide
that I should respond to you?"
62833: says. "You haven't been listening to the conversation for long enough,
so toddle along and irritate someone else, before I cast my kill-audio magic on
you!"

Digga returns to the Reverend.
62989: "I'm already following you," says Digga irritably.
63075: shouldn't, but fails. "Oh, why not,"
63114: says, sighing heavily. "I've got nothing better to do at the moment."
63182: "What do you mean, stop?" says Digga irritably. "I'm not doing
anything."
63251: "Well, that was a complete waste of time," says Digga.
63350: Digga spares a brief moment to snarl at you. "Old handers like me don't
have time for such elementary questions. Newcomers should consult the library
first to see if the answers to their questions can be found there. Haven't you
ever heard of S-P etiquette?"
63543: "Old Drew?" says Digga with a hint of affection. "Yes, I remember him.
He wrote some of the best spells ever seen. I don't know where he's got to
recently, though."
63675: "That man brings out the worst in me," says Digga. "He makes multiple
mailshots around the village, and keeps asking for help with an illegal
Monsterz spell, while at the same time claiming that he doesn't own such a
spell. Maybe I should just kill-audio and kill-visual him."
63883: "She may have had a point," says Digga reluctantly. "Maybe we were
bickering a bit too much."
63961: "It's a perfectly good town," says Digga defensively.
64010: "I'm one of the most prominent members of this village. I can't say
exactly what I do, for fear of revealing a bias."
64108: "She's a villager, but I don't know much about her."
64157: "I've never talked to him," says Digga.
64195: "Never heard of anyone with that name, or code name," says Digga. "They
can't be of any importance."
64279: "Surely you must have heard of Monsterz by now," says Digga. "It's that
spell that conjures up spectres and insubstantial monsters. The idea is to blow
them all away with a peashooter, and pick up points along the way. It
originated in that big town miles from here, and although a version for our
magic weavers hasn't been released yet, somebody has written it. Trouble is,
illegal photographic copies of the spell have been circulating for some time,
and I suspect that the Reverend owns such a copy."
64641: "I'm much more important," states Digga with not a hint of arrogance.
64694: "I don't know anything about that," says Digga.
64737: Digga might be an irritating self-righteous fool sometimes but he
doesn't deserve to be attacked.
64849: Digga blanches with alarm upon seeing Silk.
64999: "What gives you the right to distract me?" huffs Digga, before turning
back to the argument.
65078: Digga doesn't hear you.
65168: "I'm not going in there," says Digga firmly. "I'm not welcome, and I
wouldn't want to go near the Reverend's illegal spell collection anyway."
65312: shouldn't do what you say, but fails. Reluctantly,
65402: Digga can't go that way.
65435: "I'm not going in there," says Digga firmly.
65470: Digga can't go that way.
65514: "Why can't you?" says Digga.
65539: "Get in the basket and I'll lift you up!" calls Digga from above.
65597: It suddenly occurs to you that if Digga were to lower you down the well,
you would drown. You decide against it.
65702: Digga turns the crank, and you begin to rise slowly. Soon you are back
at the top of the shaft.
65792: Reluctantly, Digga turns the crank, lowering you down into the well. As
expected, you pass the surface of the water without getting wet, and soon find
yourself at the bottom.
65929: Digga doesn't see the point in doing that.
65982: Digga calls down to you from the top of the well. "I'll wait for you up
here,"
66073: Ayvrv,
Digga wearily follows you here.
66201: Wisher has hidden herself to!" he babbles before fleeing.
66298: Dabbing his sweating brow with a handkerchief, he slumps into his
favourite armchair.
66492: The Reverend himself is collapsed in a comfortable chair, his feet up on
a table.
66551: The Reverend is hurrying off home, by the looks of things.
66652: Digga wags an indignant finger at the Reverend. "All your spells have
been pinched from the archives!"
66732: "Well!" says the Reverend, flustered. "I never did heard such
inscruciating nonsenseness in my whole lovely liveliness!"
66826: "You're so transparent," Digga spits. "You ask for help with the
Monsterz magic in village meetings, and then claim that you don't have one of
the illegal photograph copies!"
66958: The Reverend puts his hands on his hips. "You've nowt so much proof as
one iota! Maybe you consider shooting up and stop so much argumenting all the
moment!"
67076: "Aha!" says Digga triumphantly. "But proof I have! And I've sent it all
off by carrier pigeon to the Office of Fair Spellcasting! Expect to hear
someone knocking at your door in the near future!"
67226: "No-one's coming a-knocking at my door frontage!" says the Reverend
firmly. "Get your own factual accuracies in a correct state of being! I make
questionings out of a healthiable love to learn the data! Mayhaps you, good
none-friend Digga, should patronage a page out of my own dear good book!"
67442: "Your book?" cries Digga increduously. "I wouldn't want to dirty my
hands, and I doubt I would be able to read the badly written nonsense anyway!"
67556: "Huh!" huffs the Reverend. "You are always so arguing! That's all I am
to stand. I am off from this village for good!" This provokes a few cheers from
the crowds, but the Reverend doesn't move an inch, merely folding his arms.
67728: "And another thing," says the Reverend, "if some personage should so
possess a photographic recreation of an allegical un-kosher Monsterz, what
should that be your business for?"
67862: "So you're admitting that you have an illegal copy?" says Digga eagerly.
67922: "I did not utter any such submission!" says the Reverend firmly. "You
are happily too keen to aim the point of suspicion at good-go-well folk around
you! My head wanders with enquiries of what you should be undisclosing
yourself!"
68092: "That's not the point!" argues Digga irritatedly.
68136: "Oh," says the Reverend with false innocence. "So the village populous
has deemed you a good decider of what's fairly and unfairly 'the point', has
it?"
68254: Digga snarls. "You're just muddying the waters now, talking a load of
babble to try to put me off the scent."
68338: "I wager," says the Reverend, "that if any folk are indulging themselves
in a light sprinking of 'babble', then those folk are you!"
68438: jhn"'Those folk are me'?" asks Digga. "What on earth are you going on
about?"
68504: The Reverend tuts. "Typical unbashfully rudeness-like from yours most
unfalsely!"
68570: Before Digga can get a chance to respond to his charge, the Reverend
continues. "Why is this Digga entry so humungously unsufferable?"
68672: "Not as unsufferable," ventures Digga, "as all your pathetic mailshots
to the village every other hour about the fabulous spell collection in your
cottage, all of which are of a questionable origin!"
68818: The Reverend's face turns red. "What are you accusationally probing me
of?" he booms.
69011: Wisher! Tea for our guest!" He then slumps back in his chair,
fortunately making no attempt to initiate a conversation.
69114: The Reverend doesn't appear to have heard you, engrossed in the
argument.
69177: "Drew Tungshinach, indeed?" says the Reverend, raising an eyebrow. "I
have not any of his fine-well spells in my collection. But I can do a flashy
whirly spell for your enjoymentful."
69317: "That man is always most complaining!" says the Reverend strongly. "He
is a field full of grass and a snifferty snitch to boot!"
69419: "Daisy? I know not much of that fair cow," says the Reverend without
malice.
69483: "A lovely cup of tea she makes," says the Reverend.
69529: "A stonkily humungous spell, that is," enthuses the Reverend.
69583: "The finest spells in the land!" booms the Reverend. This is obviously a
well-practised line.
69726: "I have accepted audio information of the name, but precious nothing
else."
69786: "The oddest thing," ponders the Reverend. "A man with a one letter
name!"
69850: "My favourite place to live," says the Reverend.
69895: "I am the good Reverend," he explains. "Nothing more, nothing less, but
everything inbetween."
69975: "Monsterz?" blusters the Reverend. "I have not such a spell in my
ownership!" He leans forward and speaks quietly. "Does your fair self store
knowledge of the location of extra levels?" Your disapproving look is enough to
tell him that you don't.
70161: "My religious philosophies," explains the Reverend carefully, "are
available office hours only."
70232: "I know naught of the subjects that utter forth from yours most
respectively," says the Reverend.
70316: The Reverend is too engrossed in the argument to have heard you.
70373: "Fairmost greetings," beams the Reverend.
70406: "Your pattern of speak-making is most unclear," says the Reverend.
70463: The Reverend is harmless enough - there's no need to attack him.
70528: "Very generous of you, but my weight I must look upon," says the
Reverend, patting his not-insubstantial tummy.
70621: Don't do that - you might be able to use it yourself.
70672: "A donation?" asks the Reverend. Before you can say anything to the
contrary, he plucks the penny out of your hand and pockets it.
70767: The Reverend doesn't seem interested in that.
70811: There are at least thirty of them, and only one of you. Not terribly
good odds.
70879: They are somewhat lacking in social skills and ignore you.
70925: They do not react to you at all.
70959: It is a standard monument, nothing more, nothing less.
71007: The brick wall isn't important.
71039: Sacromys Pemcoangs has been designated a smoke-free zone by the council.
You intend to stick to that even if the Reverend isn't.
71134: The message on the sign reads:
71218: You turn the sign round. There is writing on this side.
71368: It is too heavy to lift.
71397: Lying in a gap between two cobblestones is a shiny penny.
71455: You can't put that in the gap.
71490: Absolutely no way!
71531: There's no point; humans lost the ability to eat grass (and hold it
down) a long time ago.
71610: Oblivious to any squabbles over ownership of the land, Daisy the cow has
taken up residence here.
71681: Daisy stands here, looking a little uncomfortable away from her field.
71744: Daisy glances at the newcomer with very little interest. "Humans," she
mutters to herself.
71821: Daisy nimbly avoids you, giving you a look that suggests that she
doesn't know where you've been.
71909: Distracted by the argument, Daisy doesn't hear you.
71956: "Hmm, well..." starts Daisy, before noticing your look of surprise. "Oh,
yes. You'll be wondering how I can speak. Personally, I believe I am the end
product of genetic manipulation; but the folk around here are too simple to
understand the concept so they call it magic casting. Whatever. The end result
is that I have a higher IQ than anyone else in the village, and spend most of
my days calculating pi to an even greater degree of decimal accuracy."
72300: "What can I say?" Daisy utters sheepishly. "I have a sweet tooth!"
72363: "Yes, good game," comments Daisy thoughtfully.
72407: "I don't know the fellow," says Daisy.
72445: "Good afternoon," says Daisy pleasantly.
72485: "An absolutely childish one, if you ask me," says Daisy. "Always
bickering. Always lowering the tone of this village. Still, there's humans for
you."
72605: "You want to know how far I've got with my calculation of pi?" asks
Daisy. "Let's see... three point one four one five nine two six..." You stop
Daisy, assuring her that you don't need a greater degree of accuracy. "Oh,"
says Daisy, a little crestfallen. "Remind me never to trust any calculations
you make."
72850: "The name rings a bell," says Daisy. "A villager, right? I don't have
much to do with villagers. Humans are too petty and childish for my liking."
72966: Daisy thinks. "He's just another human, right? I try to have as little
to do with humans as possible. Consider yourself honoured that I'm sparing you
a few moments of my precious time."
73108: "I can't help", says Daisy, "being a cow and all."
73156: "That Adams bloke was wrong, you know," says Daisy casually. "I've
worked it out - the answer's 51."
73242: "The thing about cheating," says Daisy, "is that when you start, where
do you stop? It's best not to start in the first place, if you ask me."
73366: "Objects mean little to me," Daisy tells you.
73408: "Don't know what that stuff is down the well," says Daisy, "but one
thing's for sure: it isn't water."
73494: "Well, if you want my advice," says Daisy, "you should find someone to
help you out there. She's too big to take on by yourself. Sorry, I can't help -
I'm only a cow."
73629: "I've already told you," she says impatiently. "I'm a genetically
engineered cow, with a very high IQ and a fully-developed voice box. And I can
eat grass, which you can't do, so there."
73773: "Delicious, yes. I'm also partial to mints," she says hopefully.
73831: Daisy gives you a startled look, but quickly recovers her composure. "I
hear human meat is very nice, served with a nice mint sauce. You ought to try
it."
73949: "Hideous buildings, hostile natives - typical human settlement, really."
74011: "What do you think I am?" asks Daisy indignantly. "A dog or something?"
74068: Daisy looks at you pityingly, as if she feels sorry for you and your
limited talents for conversation.
74145: Striking your Psychotic Ninja pose, you try to work up the courage to
attack her. But Daisy gives you a hard stare, her eyes saying
74328: Daisy ignores your offer, looking somewhat distracted.
74375: Daisy eagerly accepts the mint, eating it noisily. She watches you
carefully to see if you have got any more.
74531: Daisy ignores your offer, looking somewhat distracted.
74570: Daisy stares at the mint, licking her lips. "Sharing is good for the
soul," she murmurs. "Perhaps you'd like to share your mints..."
74703: . Didn't you know?"
74780: uhn
Daisy watches you keenly for a moment, but her attention is drawn to
the argument in the village centre. She turns round to witness it properly.
74901: You've always wondered if cows can really frown. Maybe normal ones
can't, but Daisy isn't normal, and is doing so now. She is watching the
argument with dismay, shaking her head and tutting every now and again.
75110: Daisy the cow huffs a few times, clearly having had enough of the
childish bickering. "All right, all right!" she calls loudly, and everyone
around stops to look at her. "You're behaving like little children, just
because you don't have any spells to play with. Just grow up, and learn to
write spells of your own if it really bothers you."

Digga turns on her. "Oh
yes?" he asks viciously. "So it's all right for you to air your views, but not
us?"

Daisy is not impressed. "I'm not the one bitching and bickering. Now be
off, before I tell all your Mummies about you." That seems to do the trick;
fear fills the faces of the assembled crowds and they are off in a flash. The
Reverend mumbles something about his tea being ready and starts off. Digga,
looking somewhat deflated, slumps down by the side of the statue and starts
sulking.

Daisy surveys the scene, looking satisfied. Then, having forgotten
about the mints, she turns on her heels. (Or she would have done if she'd had
any heels on which to turn.)
75974: Daisy nudges the door open with her nose, and peers inside.
76137: Daisy the cow plods along and gulps up the mint in no time. She watches
you expectantly.
76438: The Reverend performs a classic double-take at the sight of Daisy.
"What's a bovine doing in my lovely home?" he cries. "Out! Out!" Daisy huffs,
murmurs "I didn't want to stay in this rotten dump anyway," and turns to leave.
76611: Wisher almost has a seizure at the sight of a cow in her employer's
living room. "Eeeek!" she shrieks. "Get out! Get out!" Daisy reluctantly turns
to leave.
76734: oxn
Edna barely bats an eyelid at the sight of Daisy in her shop. "Back
for more abacus beads, Daisy?" she asks.
76822: ohn
Tilly glances at Daisy before returning to her book. It seems that
Daisy is a regular visitor to the library.
76910: The salesman sees Daisy and turns to her, ignoring you. "Does Madam
require any assistance?" he asks.

"Cut the spiel, buster," says Daisy, not
impressed. "I'm here for the mints."
77096: Realising that she is wasting her time, Daisy turns and heads back to
her field.
77214: Daisy is carefully watching a mint you are carrying, saliva dripping
from her mouth.
77476: Daisy's mind appears to be elsewhere - she doesn't react to the dropped
mint.
77541: Daisy quickly gobbles up the mint before you have a chance to stop her.
She watches you carefully, wondering if you are going to drop any more.
77657: Daisy's mind appears to be elsewhere - she doesn't react to the dropped
mints.
77900: before you have a chance to stop her. She watches you carefully,
wondering if you are going to drop any more.
78088: within, but she can't get her nose inside. After a moment, she gives in.
78151: Daisy objects strongly to this. "What do you think I am, a simple animal
or something?" she huffs.
78229: Daisy eyes you threateningly. "Okay," she says, "lets get one thing
straight here. You try that, you die. Got it?"
78318: The Reverend leads a quiet and cosy life in this little cottage, a stark
contrast to the life he leads outside of it. The living room is all comfortable
browns and sunset reds, with a fat padded armchair you could easily lose
yourself in, facing a roaring fire. The window looks out onto the field outside
78583: The street is out to the northwest.
78677: That seems unnecessarily destructive.
78740: Wisher, preventing you from leaving. "You mustn't leave with the cup."
78815: Wisher would fair be upset if you upped and offed with that most loved
item of drinkerage."
78986: The Reverend is tired and doesn't see you leave with the strength spell.
79042: The Reverend's spell collection is of mixed quality, the spells having
been written by amateurs.
79119: One of the spells stands out - a strength spell.
79162: You can't swipe the lot of them!
79283: Wisher's face. Reluctantly, you decide against sitting down - it would
obviously cause the poor woman too much distress.
79377: This is not the time to be sitting down on the job!
79414: The Reverend is currently sitting on it. You don't fancy sitting on his
lap.
79480: That seems unnecessarily destructive.
79512: You always suspected that you'd go out in a blaze of glory, but that
doesn't mean you ought to hasten the process by walking into the fire.
79613: You cannot see anything within the fire.
79650: You can't see any such thing.
79678: You'd have to go out to the field to interact with the cow.
79722: You'd have to go out to the field to interact with the cow.
79786: wisher stops you. "Oh, my dear," she says worriedly, "the Reverend
wouldn't like it if you just walked off with one of his treasured spells."
80009: wisher. "There's no tea left in it."
80267: wisher, "to start cleaning about the house when there's a guest here."
You suspect, however, that she doesn't trust you.
80420: Wisher.
80494: Wisher.
80512: wisher looks confused. "You don't have anything to apologise for, dear."
80604: Wisher. "I can't do that. The Reverend wouldn't approve."
80679: Wisher worriedly. "Oh, okay. I don't see why not..." She wanders out
into the kitchen to put the kettle on.
80828: Wisher, returning from the kitchen with a cup of tea which she hands to
you. "Now drink up, because you're not really supposed to be here."
80955: Wisher, coming in from the kitchen with a cup of tea which she hands to
you. She then dashes quickly off to some other part of the cottage.
81106: She'd only put it back in the collection. Maybe you could find a use for
it?
81283: wisher rather too quickly. "Very good employer. Yes, very good. Yes."
She looks anxious, having already run out of things to say, and quickly
involves herself in straightening out her pinny.
81428: "I'm the Reverend's housekeeper," she explains.
81472: "Oh, that Digga fellow is always trying to upset the good Reverend. I
don't know why he can't just leave him alone!"
81628: Wisher. "The thought of Daisy sitting in that field really puts me off
my Sunday lunch."
81740: Wisher informs you, "so keep your hands off it, if you please."
81825: Wisher unhelpfully.
81964: She'd only put it back in the collection. Maybe you could find a use for
it?
82022: You can't see any such thing.
82052: A cup containing delicious steaming tea.
82081: An empty cup.
82135: You can't - the jar isn't empty.
82167: You pour the tea carefully into the jar.
82196: You can't pour into that.
82230: Cups are for containing tea only.
82265: The tea sinks into the floor and is soon gone.
82302: You can't pick up the steaming tea!
82455: You can't pour into that.
82488: The basket isn't suitable for containing the tea!
82550: It's a bit too hot for you.
82846: Ends shop, famed for stocking all manner of useless items. Rigg Street
runs from the northwest to the south, while to the west
82998: You can't - they are all closed.
83059: Silk has you cornered.
83085: Tilly, the most utterly desirable librarian in the world, surely, sits
behind the enquiry desk quietly reading a book.
83170: Tilly, you can see, is looking extremely concerned at your plight.
83233: You have more pressing concerns at the moment - such as the evil woman
Silk.
83293: A truly wonderful thought... but she couldn't possibly like you, so
there's no chance of it happening.
83373: How could you even contemplate attacking the woman you love?
83433: Tilly shrugs her shoulders shyly. "It's a mystery, isn't it?"
83489: "It's quite a small town," says Tilly, "but that's the appeal of it,
really. Much better than those dreadful cities with their concrete jungles. Our
weavers are faster and more efficient than theirs as well."
83647: Tilly shrugs helplessly. "I'm afraid I don't know anything that could
help with your mission."
83723: "Oh dear," smiles Tilly. "He ought to spend some time in here, to
improve his English."
83845: Well, it is the secret service he runs, after all.
83889: Tilly shakes her head with wonder. "Isn't Daisy incredible? She says
humans depress her, because we're always arguing."
83986: Tilly blushes. "You wouldn't want to know anything about me," she says
bashfully. "I'm afraid I'm not very interesting."
84082: "I don't know much about Digga," says Tilly. "She's a prominent member
of the village, but I've never really spoken to him."
84195: ," says Tilly thoughtfully. "I don't recognise the name. Sorry!"
84255: Tilly smiles, and leans forward conspiratorily. "Actually, there aren't
that many good books here. I've been trying to persuade the chief librarian to
stock more fiction, but so far he's refused."
84401: "You like the statues outside? They're nice, aren't they? A bit too
grand for this building, perhaps, but even so..."
84501: Temple, the chief librarian, is an okay person but his taste in books
leaves quite a lot to be desired." Suddenly realising how loudly she said that,
Tilly quickly looks around to see if anyone else heard.
84653: Tilly turns an interesting shade of red. "Ahem, I don't know much about
you," she says, avoiding eye contact.
84739: "The Reverend is always going on about his spell collection," says Tilly
with a sigh. "I actually went round once to take a look, but I couldn't see
anything interesting, except perhaps for the strength spell. I could have done
with that when I last moved house."
84936: "Erm, chocolates?" says Tilly guiltily. "What about chocolates? No, I
haven't had any for a long time. I'm on a diet, you see." Inwardly you grin,
and decide not to press the issue.
85078: "He's sweet, isn't he?" says Tilly. "I was only in the sweet shop the
other day, and..." Her words tail off as she starts to look flustered. "Erm,
that is, I just nipped in to say hello. Didn't buy anything, of course, seeing
as I'm on a diet." She briefly avoids eye contact.
85287: "I'm sorry," says Tilly, looking pained at not being able to help you.
"I'm afraid I know little about that."
85388: "Hi," says Tilly, blushing, keeping her eyes on the ground.
85442: That would really help your chances of going out with Tilly, now,
wouldn't it? You shake your head, wondering why on earth you even considered
saying that.
85553: "Er, yes," says Tilly, unwilling to let you know that she doesn't know
what you're talking about.
85643: "No thanks," says Tilly, smiling. "I'm on a diet." You blush, suddenly
feeling very embarrassed. Does she think you're overweight?
85753: "That's very kind," says Tilly, "but I've been told to cut back on my
caffine intake." You consider this for a moment, your heart beating wildly. Is
this a rejection? Is she secretly saying that she can't stand the sight of you,
that she doesn't want any gifts from you?
86034: Tilly smiles shyly back.
86058: You don't even have the courage to kiss her, so a complete body search
is out of the question.
86137: You have no intention of bossing Tilly about. It is not in your nature.
86230: Tilly peers over her book to see what's going on. You shoot her a look
of panic as Silk playfully strolls towards you, and her face fills with worry.
86342: Silk is baring down on you now. Tilly looks around desperately for help,
but the library is suspiciously quiet and empty.
87342: The old well, no longer in use, is rusty but thankfully still intact. It
became obsolete overnight after the accidental creation of water pipes beneath
the village (the result of a drainpipe spell misfiring), and no one cared to
preserve it. Water shimmers at the bottom, and the crank is still in place
87832: Most villagers use it as a wishing well these days. The village lies off
to the southwest.
87928: The basket is too far down the well for you to enter.
87985: Carefully, you climb into the basket. But the weak old rope breaks under
your weight, sending you plunging down the well. Before you have time to react
properly, you hit the bottom, and everything goes black.

When you regain
consciousness, you find yourself tied to a bed, with a feeling that you're not
in Sacromys Pemcoangs any more...
88231: With care, you climb into the basket.
88288: It would be best to find a relatively sedate way of getting down the
well, if you must go down.
88385: The basket is currently out of reach.
88419: Although water appears to shimmer at the bottom of the well, you suspect
that this is merely a bit of magic cast to fool people.
88508: Water shimmers at the bottom of the well.
88567: You drop the penny into the well and make a wish, something involving a
certain librarian you know. Instead of splashing, the penny silently passes
through the surface as if the water weren't really there; it lands beyond with
a barely audible thud. The water must be an illusion, a spell - but why?
88778: The penny drops down the well, through the water illusion. There is a
barely audible thud very soon after.
88875: down the well, expecting a splash as it hits the water. But it passes
straight through as if the water wasn't there, and lands with a thud somewhere
below. The water must be an illusion! But why?
89028: down the well. It passes silently through the illusion of water and
lands with a thud somewhere at the bottom.
89110: The well is very deep - you'd injure yourself if you just dropped down
it.
89167: Life isn't that bad, surely?
89195: You look down the well, and decide that climbing down it is something
beyond your capabilities.
89266: The crank is used to lower or raise an object such as a bucket.
89534: Unfortunately, there is no rope around the crank at the moment.
89665: You think about it for a moment, and come to the conclusion that it
wouldn't work. You would only be able to turn the crank until it was no longer
within reach, and then you'd be stuck.
89846: You turn the crank a little.
89987: You turn the crank awhile, but nothing of any note happens.
90039: A strange impression has been made in the dirt near the well.
90084: The impression of a double-sizer's footprint has been made in the dirt
near the well.
90158: On closer inspection it seems to be some sort of footprint. But it is no
ordinary footprint - this is twice the size of the average Sacromys Pemcoangs
foot, and could only have been made by a double-sizer.
90303: The print was made by a foot belonging to a double-sizer - though you
haven't heard of any sightings of such people in the village.
90426: It's not within reach.
90535: Having not paid for the length of old rope, your conscience orders you
to leave it behind as you depart from the shop.
90630: Edna glances at Silk but seems neither surprised nor frightened.
"Haven't seen one of you double-sizers for a long while," she muses.
90761: Edna takes the rope and examines it. "Money for old rope?" she says,
chuckling. "Maybe not. Tell you what - my kettle's on the blink and I'm gasping
for a drink. If you can get me some tea, I'll give you the rope."
90920: Edna examines the rope. "No, I'm afraid I can't buy that. It's too
tatty."
90986: Edna takes one look at the spell and shakes her head. "I'm sorry - I
don't deal in spells. Odds and ends only, me."
91096: Edna takes the tea gratefully. "That old rope is yours now if you want
it," she says between taking sips from the jar.
91181: Edna's eyes light up. "Tea! You're a mind reader!" she says, taking the
jar of tea gratefully. "Tell you what, you can have the old rope if you want,
in exchange."
91304: Edna examines the jar. "I'm afraid it's not useless enough for this
shop", she says apologetically.
91384: Edna examines what you offer. "Hmm, nice length of rope, that.
Unfortunately, I only stock useless items here."
91472: "What a pretty penny," comments Edna. "But I prefer exchanges."
91618: "You want the rope?" asks Edna. "Well, I couldn't possibly accept money
for old rope, but I could really do with a nice cup of tea. Or mug, or
whatever. I ain't fussy!"
91745: "The rope's yours now," says Edna.
91781: "Drew Tungshinach? Pah! Spent all day writing spells for those wretched
Magic Weaver contraptions. He and his sort ought to get out more."
91891: "Silk, my dear?" asks Edna. "Silk? Sorry. We've got none of that here."
91957: "Lovely, aren't they?" says Edna proudly. "They're my pride and joy. But
they're not for sale."
92040: Edna frowns. "There's nothing to tell." You gather that she would rather
you minded your own business.
92120: "Digga, eh?" chuckles Edna. "Digga's a card. Must be a nightmare
deciding what underwear to put on, I shouldn't wonder, when you're always
changing gender. Digga's a good person deep down, though. A bit too defensive
and self-righteous at times, but all in all a good egg."
92326: "He can be quite annoying at times," admits Edna, "especially when he
bombards the village with mailshots about his wonderful spell collection. I
went there once to see it, and the only decent thing was the strength spell.
And what's more, someone should teach him how to speak proper English!"
92540: "Barnie's a sweet lad," says Edna. "If only the rest of the villagers
were as nice."
92613: "Tilly the librarian?" asks Edna. "She's not seeing anyone if that's
what you mean."
92685: Edna points over to the west. "There's a statue of old Sam Cragone, the
founder of the village, over in the village centre. Some people find the name
Sacromys Pemcoangs quite strange and bulky, but I think it's an anagram. For
example, you can derive 'Sam Cragone' from it, but I can't work out what the
remaining letters may stand for."
92951: "I would absolutely kill for a nice drink of tea," says Edna firmly.
93002: "Very nice tea, thank you," says Edna.
93033: "Can't help you there," says Edna.
93077: "Hello m'dear," says Edna, not bothering to look up.
93118: Edna looks confused but doesn't reply.
93176: "You want the rope?" asks Edna. "Hmm, lets see... I couldn't really
accept money for old rope, but I'd be willing to exchange it for a nice drink
of tea."
93293: "It's yours if you want it," says Edna. "You've already paid for it."
93356: Edna gives you a funny look. "You'll be throwing me a stick and saying
'fetch' next!"
93466: Edna lifts the jar to her lips and takes a long gulp of the tea.
93524: Edna drinks the last of the steaming tea and wipes her mouth. "Ahh, that
was lovely," she says, and puts the jar down.
93660: Amongst all the junk is a tatty old length of rope, which doesn't look
particularly strong.
93725: You can't see anything of any particular importance amongst all the
junk.
93820: "Money for old rope?" chuckles Edna. "I don't think so. But I'd kill for
a cup of tea... or a mug or something. I'm not fussy."
93921: You don't need to buy the length of old rope - it is yours already.
93979: Edna leaps at you and slaps your arm. "No no no no no no no! Don't touch
my lovely brooms! They're not for sale!" You can only wonder why they are on
display in the shop, in that case.
94150: An orchestral arrangement of a frantic pop song fills the air, but you
can't see the source.
94246: The salesman, like most, is only trained for very limited customer
participation in his little demonstrations, and doesn't react.
94337: There are no questions you need to reply to.
94515: The salesman hovers nearby, eager to make a sale.
94566: The salesman takes one look at Silk and wimpers. "Erm," he says almost
breathlessly. "Do excuse me, but I think it's time for my coffee break!" He
promptly legs it.
94760: The salesman approaches you silently. "Does Madam require any
assistance?" he asks.
94845: He continues without bothering to listen for a reply. "In our store we
have the largest selection of top-of-the-range Magic Weavers you are likely to
find in the village of Sacromys Pemcoangs."
95008: "How about a demonstration?" the salesman asks, clapping his hands
together with enthusiasm. "Does Madam have a spell of her own she would like to
try out, or shall we use a spell from here?"
95213: "Do you have a spell we could use?" the salesman prompts.
95273: "Not to worry," assures the salesman. "I have an orchestra spell here...
somewhere..." He spends a moment searching through some papers, and pulls out a
yellowing scroll. "Soon have this up and running," he says cheerily.
95454: The salesman takes the strength spell, looking a little surprised. "Oh
wow," he says. "I haven't seen one of these spells for absolutely ages. We'll
have it up and running in a jiffy!"
95616: The salesman feeds the orchestra spell into one of the brand new magic
weavers, and almost instantaneously, miniature fireworks explode above it,
signifying success. "How about that!" enthuses the salesman.
95823: Gina Grasshopper's "La La... More Tea, Vicar"
95872: Faith Alive's "Don't Ye Stop Moving"
95913: The Nice Belles' "If You Want To Be My Husband"
95961: Wood Pulp's "Peasants"
95990: Desert's "Don't Look Back in Bangor"
96029: Karen Minone's "I Should Be So Fortunate"
96072: Mad Donna's "Like A Clergyman"
96106: Burley Bossy's "Gold Flinger"
96138: Turn Left's "I'm Too Desirable"
96220: The salesman feeds the strength spell into one of the brand new magic
weavers, and almost instantaneously, miniature fireworks explode above it,
signifying success. "How about that!" enthuses the salesman.
96394: Suddenly a spherical green blur materialises in mid-air. "That's the
strength magic," explains the salesman, prompted by your worried look. "Just
put any item into it to make that item stronger."
96563: The salesman looks at you blankly as you attempt to offer him the spell.
96623: The salesman smiles kindly at you. "Madam is kind, but we already have a
spell."
96693: The salesman looks at the penny you offer him with disbelief. "I'm
afraid that even the cheapest of our range of Magic Weavers is going to cost a
lot more than that."
96836: . "I'm sorry," he says, looking genuinely apologetic. "We're not allowed
to accept that as currency, and we're not allowed to accept bribes."
96954: "Hello Madam," he beams.
96996: The salesman raises his eyebrows "Spell from here? So you don't have a
spell of your own?"
97063: "I am not entirely sure what Madam is trying to say," he says.
97117: "Erm," says the salesman, confused. "I'm afraid I haven't been trained
to answer questions. I only do demonstrations and sales. If you'd like to come
back tomorrow, our customer questions manager should have returned from his
holiday by then."
97299: Don't do that. The poor chap is only trying to do his job.
97353: The salesman, like most, is only trained for very limited customer
participation in his little demonstrations, and doesn't react.
97444: The salesman just smiles, looking a little confused.
97500: You practice your usual dance routine (that is, to bounce up and down
frantically) with the salesman.
97597: The sound isn't coming from any of the weavers.
97632: The Magic Weavers are silent.
97753: The salesman prevents you from touching the models.
97799: The illusion is insubstantial and beyond your reach.
97843: The rope and the basket are the only means of getting back up the shaft.
You mustn't touch it!
97917: It might be best if you didn't tamper with the rope while it provides
your only way of getting back up the shaft.
98033: You remain paralysed to the spot, caught in a mixture of fear and a
desire to satisfy your curiosity.
98121: You make a break for the north exit. Silk tries to stop you, but you
dive under her legs and quickly scramble to your feet before she can stop you.
"Come here, you little pipsqueak!" she screams furiously.
98281: You listen carefully to what Silk is saying.
98327: Drew tries to focus on your words, but he seems too tired to respond.
98381: You peck poor Drew on the cheek. The corners of his mouth twitch in the
faintest ghost of a smile, but he gives no other response.
98479: That would be unnecessary. Drew isn't a threat to you at the moment.
98591: No matter how hard you try, the chains just won't give.
98719: must be all of six foot, with legs that seem to go on forever. She is
quite possibly the most beautiful woman you have seen, but with hint of cruelty
in her features. She wears a shiny blue bodystocking that appears to have been
sprayed on.
98932: Silk, tiring of these games, makes a lunge for you and grabs you by the
hair before you can escape. "You've caused me quite a lot of trouble," she says
thoughtfully. "It seems only fitting that I make you suffer as a consequence."
99106: What happens next is far too horrible to convey in words.
99152: Her nasty smile fades as a group of Secret Service guards pours in from
the west doorway. "How tedious," she sighs, and sends them all flying with some
of her devilish magic. They smack into various walls, slump to the floor and
remain still.

 "Time to leave, I think," she says. "I've had enough fun for
one day." Before she goes, she gives you an almighty slap in the face, knocking
you senseless. When you awake, it is far too late to stop her or save the
spellmaker.
99491: Her nasty smile fades when she realises that a crowd of villagers has
gathered here, fearful of her but angry of the way she is treating you. "Or
maybe not," adds Silk hastily. "This village is too boring to bother with."
Before she leaves, she gives you an allmighty slap in the face, knocking you
senseless. When you awake, it is far too late to stop her or save the
spellmaker.
99792: Your jaw almost drops as you watch Silk climb out of the shaft of the
well, having not even broken into a sweat. "You don't get away that easily,"
she purrs.
99920: Silk appears from the shaft of the well, having climbed down the rope.
"I'm not going to let you get away, little pipsqueak," she giggles horribly.
100040: Silk soon catches up, making a show of walking slowly.
100223: "Well," purrs a silky-smooth voice from nearby, "what do we have here?"
You turn to see who spoke. A woman, twice as tall as you, with classical good
looks, shiny blonde hair and a body stocking that could well have been sprayed
on, leans seductively against the wall by the side of the east exit.
100449: ,
The woman slinks towards you. "Oh, where are my manners?" she says.
"I'm Silk. Drew and I have been so bored down here, just the two of us. Isn't
that right, Drew honey?" Drew moans quietly, trying to turn his head away from
Silk.
100631: "Well, Mattie," says Silk with mock sincerity. "It is Mattie, isn't it?
Well, Mattie, we knew you'd been put on the case, but we didn't quite expect
you to get this far. Still, what's life without a few surprises?"
100799: Panic begins to rise within you as you realise that Silk is now
standing between you and the north exit. Fortunately, Silk appears not to have
noticed this reaction. "I might as well tell you what's been going on, since
you've done so well to get this far. And, of course, since you won't be going
any further."
101027: "To the east of this cavern," explains Silk with a gleeful expression
on her face, "is a passageway that leads to Plantasitoy. You are aware of
Plantasitoy, I take it?" Indeed you are. It is a great town not too far away,
where the Magic Weavers are said to be the best in the area, and there are a
surplus of fantastic and dazzling spells written by teams of experts.
101295: Silk continues. "When Plantasitoy was first set up, a number of years
ago, we were aware of the quality of the spellmakers within Sacromys Pemcoangs
and the other surrounding villages. We immediately hatched a plot to steal them
away from you, one by one, over time, so that you wouldn't grow too suspicious.
And now, of course, our work is almost done in this village. Old Drew here is
the last spellmaker on our list. We will brainwash him and force him to write
spells for our own magic weavers."
101653: Silk's smile broadens. "And now, it is time to deal with you, my little
friend." She starts moving, very slowly and deliberately, towards you.
101765: She is getting very close now. You wonder if you should do something.
101821: Silk is almost upon you. You must act fast!
101864: Silk lifts you by your lapels with ease, moving your face up to hers.
"Goodbye, little pipsqueak," she whispers, and suddenly you are being flung
against a wall. Your head hits the hard rock surface with a crack, and then
everything fades away to nothing...
102152: does not even acknowledge that you have spoken. She wishes you to know
that she is in total control, and to reply to you would go against that.
102257: Yeah... as if...
102282: Silk doesn't look the romantic type.
102332: The idea of a superstrong mint is tempting, but it would hardly help
your mission.
102411: You drop the old rope into the magic. With a sudden flash of green
light, the magic vanishes, and a revitalised length of rope drops to the floor.
102514: You don't see any point in making that any stronger.
102559: Well, you've always wanted a strong arm or two, but on the other hand
you don't trust magic enough to use it on yourself.
102655: Perhaps discarded by one of the fleeing crowds, a wicker basket lies
unattended nearby.
102794: You can't put tea in the basket - it would just run through the holes.
Besides, it would make the basket sticky.
102892: The basket is currently out of reach.
102930: It would be best to leave the basket as it is for the time being,
seeing as it is the only way you can get back up the well shaft.
103025: You will have to get the rope first.
103175: A green door lies open very close by, the doorway leading nowhere as
far as you can tell.
103240: A green door stands unsupported very close by, well away from any
walls.
103302: The door isn't open.
103341: voice call out somewhere on the other side. "Come in!"
103391: You haven't even had your first date yet! That reminds you of the old
joke. What does a lesbian bring with her on her second date? A removal van. Har
har.
103507: Never! How could you even contemplate it?
103544: Tilly smiles at you.
103596: Cashpound the questions at this stage," she points out kindly.
103701: Now's not the time to be ordering Tilly around!
103742: Tilly smiles back, warmly.
103923: , by the way, has had to pop out on official business - very hush hush,
apparently - but he wanted me to welcome you back. Now, what were his special
instructions again...? Ah yes. Going out the door quits the game, but RESTORE,
RESTART and UNDO are left to your own discretion. If there's anything you want
to know about the game, just ask. I can't guarantee I'll know the answer, but
you can always try."
104261: Cashpound with a sigh, "this was written with the third annual IF
competition in mind. People generally either loved it or hated it. A lot of
people were put off by the fantasy setting - an 'oh no, not another dwarf
village' reaction. Others complained that the puzzles had no reason or
motivation, and that the ending was crap. This is true, unfortuntely; very
little thought or design went into it. But there we are."
104569: Cashpound starts off on a little philosophical rant about how life is
merely energy or interaction of energy, but he stops when he realises that he's
boring you.
104689: "Well, there's a debug mode, if that's what you mean. With all this
talk of weavers, the password is the name of a very famous one: someone who'd
no doubt be very pleased to learn that there are no aliens in this game. Once
the debug mode is on, 'runaway' skips the prologue and 'downwell' jumps to the
part where you discover what has happened to Drew."
104965: Cashpound, rubbing his chin. "Don't know too much about him, really - I
get the impression that he's ashamed of us. I understand he's 23, and that he
graduated from the University of Continual Embarrassment, or something like
that (one of the old polys anyway), in the summer. After about six months of
dossing around, some organisation took pity on him and gave him a job. Maybe
this means we won't be seeing any more terrible games like this one. We can but
hope."
105368: secretary as you know. I spend most of my days lusting over secret
agent Jane Vond. Never seem to get anywhere, though she's always promising
she'll take me out to dinner one day."
105507: Cashpound considers this. "I understand that the author was attempting
to break new ground by including a gay character in a work of IF, but without
having the character's homosexuality as a major plot point."
105682: Cashpound, raising a finger. "Basically just your typical Catwoman
clone. Who is she? She's an enemy agent working for the Plantasitoy secret
service."
105800: "It's a new town, which sprung up recently a few miles away. Very
popular, very busy. Of course, it might also be an anagram."
105932: Cashpound, rapidly changing the subject. Obviously he doesn't want to
talk about that.
106038: Cashpound with one eye on her. "Obviously she's her own person."
Evidently, he is too polite to talk about Tilly in her presence.
106140: "The town? What would you like to know about the town?" How about its
bulky name, for a start, you offer. "Well, Sacromys Pemcoangs is an anagram. I
think. Something to do with the far-too-clever-for-its-own-good allegory thing.
Your standard dull fantasy village."
106405: cashpound. "They're just cardboard cutouts, as is usual with IF, and
just sit there doing nothing much, which is also fairly typical."
106531: Cashpound, "apparently thought it was funny to make a cow the most
intelligent and mature being in the village. Small things please small minds,
methinks. Apparently, with regard to coding, the cow was the largest object in
the game. Doesn't say much about the game, really, does it?"
106767: Cashpound. "I've never been any good with them. Probably something
tedious."
106863: Cashpound. "Very hush hush."
106927: cashpound with a shrug. "I hear that the author is a bitter, twisted
type, so maybe he was trying to get back at someone."
107059: Cashpound. "Imagine that! My favourite was Madame L'Estrange, even
though it was fairly buggy. A Bear's Night Out was good, too."
107174: cashpound, a little embarrassed. "I'm afraid I haven't got any answers
for that."
107241: Some magical force prevents you from attacking him.
107283: He's not really your type, for reasons you ought to have grasped by
now.
107374: Cashpound.
107462: didn't react to it (as a joke), so the author put in a response (as
another joke). Bless him."
107547: Cashpound. "You've lost me."
107591: Cashpound frowns at you. He obviously doesn't like taking orders, which
is unfortunate considering his line of work.
107721: is currently trying to tell you exactly that. Just listen to what he
has to say.
107787: Erm. Oh dear. It's the end of the game, see, and if you haven't figured
out what's going on yet, then something must have gone dreadfully wrong
somewhere...
107904: You are Mattie, an agent of the secret service and member of the dwarf
village Sacromys Pemcoangs. The village relies heavily on magic, which is
formed by feeding spells into 'magic weaver' devices. While there are plenty of
good magic weavers around, new spells are in short supply, and the villagers
are getting restless. Your task is to hunt down the last great spellmaker to
disappear - one Drew Tungshinach. He couldn't have just walked off without
someone noticing, so what's happened to him?
108258: "The Lost Spellmaker" was written for the Third Annual Interactive
Fiction competition, where it was placed 8th.
108566: . He regrets to announce, however, that he cannot accept any proposals
of marriage he may receive on this account, and he is not interested in hearing
about yet another 'get rich quick' scheme or 'naughty girls' web site, thank
you very much.
110000: There is no reply.
110036: There is no reply.
110232: Congratulations! You have completed your mission and scored one
political point into the bargain. Whoops, sorry, no, the *game* has scored one
political point. But well done anyway!
110462: Control yourself!
110477: That wasn't designed to be tasted.
110551: Nothing happens. Perhaps there is a special door around here somewhere
already.
110613: You utter the magic word, but nothing happens. Nothing happens! You
begin to panic. What's going on here?
110700: As if by magic, a puff of smoke erupts from the ground back on Thurman
Street to the southwest. It quickly disperses, and appears to have left a large
rectangular object behind.
110828: A yellow puff of smoke erupts from the ground, and soon disperses. In
its place is a green door, looking particularly out of place as it is not
attached to any walls.
110955: A few members of the crowd cough and wave the smoke away from their
faces, but otherwise everyone ignores the dazzling special effect that has
occurred right under their noses.
111124: wisher. "Goodness! Where on earth did all this smoke come from? The
place will smell of sulphur! The Reverend will be furious! And... what's that
door doing there?"
111252: Digga isn't impressed. "The yellow smoke thing is so old hat."
111306: Barnie claps his hands excitedly. "That was good! Do it again, Mattie!
Aw, please!"
111378: Silk chuckles. "My, they're not still using the old 'smoke and door'
spell in this town, are they? How quaint."
111468: Ignoring the smoke, Edna examines the door. "Nope," she says
eventually. "This is too useful for my shop. You'll have to find somewhere else
to sell it."
111586: ohn
The Reverend looks jealous for a moment. "My possession of spells
is much greater, naturally," he bluffs.
111672: "Anyone would think that a bit of exercise would kill you," mutters
Daisy. "Magically transporting doors to people - now I've seen everything."
111784: Tilly stifles a giggle, evidently amused by your magic casting.
111854: You can't pour that.
111877: That's not a verb I recognise.
111910: You're not in the prologue any more.
111937: Prologue skipped!
113113: Cashpound what you wish. West quits, and UNDO, RESTORE and RESTORE work
as well.

<Now, back to the game!>
113223: You've already made a wish.
113244: It's traditional to drop a penny down a well before making a wish.
113291: You wish that you were two feet taller and a lot prettier.
113334: You will have to give the individual instructions needed for making
that.
113386: You smile. Isn't life a dream?
113418: You smile. Isn't life a dream?
113448: You smile insanely at the inanimate object.
113506: That would be very silly.
113530: You pat yourself on the head and murmur "Good girl" to yourself.
113614: You can't untie that.
113639: You are already within yourself (allegedly).
113702: That wouldn't do you much good.
113736: The cheat/debug mode is now on.
113764: The cheat/debug mode is now off.
113793: That's not a verb I recognise.
113831: This action is unavailable, as Silk has already been encountered.
113964: You are now in the 'end game' section.
114036: You are not holding any rope.
114070: A mystical hand, seemingly made of thousands of tiny sparkling stars,
sweeps down from above. Before you can do anything, it prods you in the ribs,
and a hollow voice echoes "It's not you!" The hand flies off again, quickly
disappearing from sight.
114255: You knock gently on your chest. There is no reply.
114296: That would be impolite.
114315: Nothing happens.
114335: You boogie around for a while, not feeling in the least bit
embarrassed.
114391: The inanimate object doesn't wish to dance with you.
114554: A surreal idea.
114571: A surreal (and mildly worrying) idea.
116404: You can't go that way.
116480: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
116512: As good-looking as ever.
116672: A small pepermint-flavoured sweet made of icing sugar.
116712: Only the best is good enough for the main room of the Secret Service
headquarters. The walls are oak-panelled, and covered with photographs of
important-looking people; the floor sparkles so much that you suspect it has
been enhanced with the aid of a spell; and the equipment is all
top-of-the-range, including the Magic Weaver in the corner. The only exit is to
the west.
117212: It is the most powerful and advanced Magic Weaver you have ever seen.
The Secret Service get all the best equipment first.
117300: It looks like something to do with boring bureaucracy.
117444: They bustle about, not quite used to shopping, but picking up the
basics.
117496: This charming little shop is a pretty close approximation of what you
imagine Heaven to be. The shelves are crammed full of jars of mints,
gobstoppers, chocolate mice and all manner of other delicious things. Behind
the main counter you see sherbet dips, jelly babies and exotic toffees. Life
doesn't get much better than this. Thurman Street lies out to the east.
117752: Barnie might not be terribly bright but he is quite possibly the nicest
person in the village, always eager to please, and thoroughly loyal to his
friends.
117860: Although the Reverend means well, he has a tendency to irritate the
local population by constantly talking about his cottage and the splendid
collection of spells contained within. He is also reknowned for his poor
command of the English language (you spent many sleepless nights wondering what
on earth a 'lebsian' was) and the way he is always provoking Digga.
118140: The villagefolk here look as if they don't get out much. They must be
weaver geeks, forced to find some other form of entertainment what with the
lack of decent new spells, and this argument is just that.
118284: The founder of the community, one Sam Cragone, is faithfully depicted
by the stone monument, staring proudly at, erm, a brick wall across the way.
The original intention had been for the statue to stand at one end of the
village, looking down to the other end, but the architects got it wrong, so
here he is now.
118504: As brick walls go, this one looks like a prime specimen. However, it
doesn't look particularly remarkable.
118580: Thurman Street runs here from the north and fades away into a dirt
trail that leads southwest into a field. Houses are well spaced out at this
quiet end of the road - one that stands out is the Reverend's cottage to the
southeast, smoke gently trailing from a small chimney pot at the top.
118780: A signpost has been implanted in the ground next to the cottage.
118824: "The Reverend is, regrettably, away at present."
118864: "The Reverend welcomes all visitors with a cup of tea and a chat."
118912: The crowds of shoppers are particularly large in this part of the
village, though you see no shops that appeal to you, and one - the Health Store
- you find especially repulsive. Thurman Street meets with Rigg Street to the
northeast, and runs off to the southwest.
119100: Horrible, horrible place. You don't want anything to do with it.
119148: One shiny new Sacromys Pemcoangs penny.
119180: Just off the village of Sacromys Pemcoangs, which is to the northeast,
lies this field, the ownership of which has been disputed for centuries. It is
nothing more than a large grass-covered plain, and does not even possess
religious or magical significance, but a great deal of hostility arises
regarding it nevertheless.
119404: It looks as green and unappetising as grass should look.
119444: Daisy spends most days chewing cud or sleeping like the lady of leisure
she is. She has a very carefree life, no doubt helped by the fact that the
entire population of the village are vegans.
119600: The Reverend's famous spell collection has apparently grown so large
that he has had to store some of the spells here in his living room.
119696: Looks very comfortable.
119716: The fire burns furiously, occasionally snapping and crackling. As you
look closer, you realise that it isn't actually burning anything - it must be
fuelled by magic.
119832: The cow munches thoughtfully on grass.
119984: It is all in a language unreadable by most people, but the title in
bold text proclaims it to be a spell of strength.
120064: Thurman Street, from the southwest, and Rigg Street, from the
southeast, meet here at the north end of the village, in front of the great
library. Stone statues of lions stand guard at either side of the entrance;
they are said to have been treated magically to guard the precious books inside
from any evil spirits. As long as they guard your true love within, you will be
happy.
120332: Magically treated or not, the statues look impressive.
120372: In days of old, Rigg Street would be packed with crowds swarming around
the spell markets. Alas, they are no more, the supply of spells having dried up
many moons ago, and the road is quiet. Rigg Street meets with Thurman Street to
the northwest, and runs down to the southeast. The old village well is along a
dirt trail to the northeast.
120612: Alas, they are all closed until the evening. Shame, that.
120656: This is the high-class section of town, where all the rich merchants
buy their goods and spend their evenings. The Rouge Rill restaurant is
especially noted for its fine cuisine and pricing well out of your league. The
only thing open at the moment is the Magic Weaver Showroom to the west, with
top-of-the-range weavers in the window reading old spells at lightning speed.
Rigg Street goes off to the north.
120948: It is closed at the moment, which is just as well because you could
never afford to eat there.
121016: The building may be grand but there is precious little space for books.
Only a few hundred have been squeezed onto the shelves, dealing mainly with
local history, mechanics of the magic weavers and 'sure-fire' ways of writing
working spells (which never are in practise). The exit lies to the south.
121224: Oh, how you long to tell Tilly how you feel. Her silken hair, her
delicate nose, that coy manner she adopts when talking to you... But when it
comes down to it, why would she like a dumpy, plump girl such as yourself?
121380: None of the books here could help you with your quest, you fear.
121428: It looks as water should look.
121452: Every possible item you will never have any use for can be found in
this shop. In addition, the proprietor seems to have a thing about brooms;
there is an extremely large range of them on offer, of all different colours,
sizes and materials, hanging from racks on the ceiling. Negotiating your way
around the shop is understandably quite difficult. The exit is to the west.
121712: Unlike the others in the village, Edna has reverted to childhood in her
old age: her energy, her enthusiasm for little things, the fact that she enjoys
the commercial breaks more than the actual plays at the theatre. She is also an
avid collector of brooms, which may seem odd, but then why do people collect
garden gnomes or stamps?
121944: Old Edna potters about nearby.
121966: Edna runs her hands along her beloved broom collection and watches them
sway with a look of pure joy.
122038: Edna searches through the junk as if looking for something specific. A
few moments later she wanders away, her search unsuccessful.
122132: Edna extracts a curious-looking item of junk from the pile and gives it
a good dusting before returning it to its place.
122216: Edna whistles a few bars of an advertising jingle.
122252: Edna chuckles at the memory of an old joke, but doesn't choose to share
it with you.
122312: A length of old rope lies among the junk.
122344: Just a tatty length of old rope.
122368: What a huge collection of brooms! Spectacular to see, but not much help
on your quest.
122432: For people with plenty of money and good taste, why not buy a Sacromys
Pemcoangs-made top-of-the-range Magic Weaver? All the latest high speed models
are on sale here, outshining other models by virtue of the electrifying
twinkliness they produce when rapidly weaving the spells into magic.
Unfortunately, new spells are in short supply, and the weavers are not being
pushed to their limits. A doorway to the east leads out to Rigg Street.
122740: The salesman is clearly a smooth operator in his expensive silken tunic
and pointed shoes with the fashionable curl at the tip. His constant smile
actually looks genuine, as if he is happy with his lot.
122884: All so very wonderful. All so very out of your price range.
122928: From here, a circular shaft leads up to the top of the well, with
bright daylight pouring down. A ghost image of the 'water surface' illusion can
be seen partway up the shaft; it was only meant to be convincing when looked
down upon. A gloomy passageway leads south.
123116: From here, the illusion can only be made out by a kind of heat-shimmer
effect, making the view of the rest of the shaft and the top of the well blur
and contort.
123228: The rope hanging from the shaft of the well, is tied to the basket.
123276: This large dome-shaped area carved out of the rock appears to be some
sort of half-way storage point. Passageways run off to the north and east, with
nothing of particular interest here in the middle... with the possible
exception of Drew Tungshinach, chained to a wall.
123468: You have a feeling that the passageway would lead far out of your way.
You decide against going that way.
123544: Drew looks exhausted, his spirit broken. He barely has the strength to
look at you.
123604: Poor old Drew. What torments, what indignities has he suffered down
here? His lips are cracked; a purple bruise stains his left cheek.
123708: Incredibly, a green spherical blur hangs in mid-air almost expectantly.
123760: It is mainly transparent, and looks almost like the blur you get in
your eyes when you stare at a strong light for too long. The difference with
this is that it is set, and doesn't follow the movement of your eyes.
123908: A strong length of rope.
123932: A fairly large and strong wicker basket.
123960: Tilly, the most gorgeous librarian in the world, stands attentively at
your side.
124020: Tilly stands proudly by your side.
124044: A fair-haired young man.
124110: Many thanks to the following people, for various reasons:

Martin
Braun, Andrew Clover, Michael Alexander Cumings-Steen, Charles Doughty,
Jonathan Fry, Paul Janzen, Howard Liu, Douglas McNeil, Graham Nelson, Stephen
Robert Norris, Paul O'Brian, Gareth Rees, Leisa ReFalo, Cody Sandifer, Nate
Schwartzman, Christine Simoes Tilden and G. Kevin Wilson.
124686: ...which means that you do not have to pay for it. It also means that
you are not allowed to charge more than a nominal fee for distribution. So
there.

"Cute. I liked it."

"I like a bit of a challenge in a puzzle,
but some were a bit obscure..."

"...other than the protagonist, I may have
liked the hint system best."

"...it's a little disappointing to find [Digga]
is a red herring. Not as disappointing, though, as the whole ending..."

"Cool
randomized title screen."

"Mattie is surely destined to become the most
significant gay icon of the 21st century..."

(Okay, I made that last one up.)

have a lie down in a darkened room, give your eyes a rest, that's what I think
you should do. See ya. <<
