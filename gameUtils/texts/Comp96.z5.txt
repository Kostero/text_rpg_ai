26581: But it's dark.
26672: You find nothing of interest.
27842: . Not bad.
27860: That was a rhetorical question.
27887: This dangerous act would achieve little.
27921: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
27957: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
27994: That seems unnecessary.
28017: Keep your mind on the game.
28042: What a good idea.
28061: You smell nothing unexpected.
28088: You hear nothing unexpected.
28113: You taste nothing unexpected.
28148: Keep your hands to yourself!
28173: You feel nothing unexpected.
28198: If you think that'll help.
28224: Digging would achieve nothing here.
28291: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
28324: You would achieve nothing by this.
28353: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
28386: But there's no water here to carry.
28417: Oh, don't apologise.

28474: Quite.
28485: Violence isn't the answer to this one.

28701: You wave, feeling foolish.
28851: You are unable to.
28870: Nothing obvious happens.
28893: That would be less than courteous.
28931: Is that the best you can think of?
28960: That's not a direction.
28983: Not that way you can't.
29015: Keep your hands to yourself.
29040: You achieve nothing by this.
29074: Futile.

29165: This provokes no reaction.
29193: There is no reply.

29257: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
29294: Time passes.
29309: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
51295: Days of searching, days of endless hacking through the levels of the I-F

53607: With a whir, the bottom of the 'playable games' bin opens, and all the
games inside disappear into an inky blackness. The bin re-closes as you hear
the games rattle and thump behind the wall within unseen machinery. Finally, a
panel in the wall rotates and a rack emerges, holding the games in the order in
which you're supposed to play them.
54052: games, all sorted and lined up in their slots, ready for you to play and
rate them. A square button to one side of the rack is marked 'Save Rating
Information', while a round button is marked 'Save All Information'

55988: You tack the paper back up on the wall.
56038: As you push the button, a panel opens in the wall, revealing a huge
laser, aimed at you! Before you can react, a green beam of light shoots out at
you, and you can't move! Suddenly, you find yourself moving jerkily around the
room.
56255: Done.
56334: Done.
56394: Done.
56468: The laser pauses, and seems about to retract. Then it seems to think
better of it, and controls your actions one more time, for good measure.
56646: Just as suddenly as it started, the laser releases you, and disappears
back behind the panel. You are quite dazed, and the sparkles before your eyes
seem to spell out "That's it! You can print out your list and go play the games
now!" before they fade into nothingness.
58260: You can examine any individual game to find out if you can play it or
not. Any game you cannot play (due to not having a computer which can play it,
for example), put it in the 'unplayable' bin. Likewise, if you feel you must
exempt yourself from playing a particular game, due to having a prior bias for
or against it (say, you betatested the game, or you have strong feelings about
issues raised in it), you can put it in the 'unplayable' bin as well. Note that
this is a personal choice, and not a requirement.

"He that judges without informing himself to the utmost that he is
capable, cannot acquit himself of judging amiss."
- John Locke, _An Essay
Concerning Human Understanding_

-=Introduction=-
58853: Many years ago, a game was written by two people named Crowther and
Woods. The game was called, variously _Adventure_, and _Collosal Cave_. It used
a text parser that the player could communicate with by typing in commands, and
it formed the foundation of many, if not most, of today's computer games. The
interface may have changed, but deep down, many of today's gaming conventions
are holdovers from that long ago game.
59158: Last year, a competition was held on the internet. Enthusiasts of text
based games wrote short games and posted them for others to play and enjoy. The
players voted on which game they liked best, and the games that got the best
response had their pick of prizes from a prize pool. Later, 6 of those games
were put on Activision's _Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom_
collection, and the authors received a pretty nice payment in return.
59477: This year, we're going to do it again, and you have the chance to be a
part of this event. However, while last year's competition had only 12 games
entered, this year's has a grand total of 27 entries. That's more text
adventures than you can shake a stick at. To participate, just read the section
on Judging and follow the instructions there.
59726: The judging will be a 'People's Choice Awards' type deal for the most
part. Everyone is able to vote. All you have to do is play every game that you
are able to (you are bound on your honor to play as many as possible and give
each of them an equal chance.) and then rate each game on a scale of 1 to 10,
no decimal places please. You have 2 hours in which to rate each game. At the
end of 2 hours, you should stop and rank the game immediately. You may continue
to play the game after that, but you may not change your rating of it based
upon anything you find after the 2 hours are up. Please be honest. The site to
mail votes to is:
60210: Let's all give him a big round of applause.
60245: Please note that this is not my address. If you email me votes I will
trash them without notice and without looking at them, because I am a big
meanie.
60356: Messages with votes in them should have a subject header of: VOTE
(unless you are entered in the competition or served as a betatester for one of
the entries, in which case it should be MISS CONGENIALITY)  Each game should be
rated on a seperate line, and you may submit multiple votes, but only the
latest dated ratings of each game will be kept.
60611: Votes will begin to be taken on Oct. 20, and must be in by Nov 30.
Shortly thereafter, results will be announced, and prizes will begin to be
distributed to the winners. For those of you who know how much different this
timescale is from the original, please just note that there are many more
entries than were expected, so more time has to be allowed for everyone to play
them. At 2 hours apiece, that's still over 50 hours of play time total.
60930: Any game that does not receive at least 10 votes on it is removed from
prize consideration.
60999: The winner will be the game with the highest average score. Each winner
will have a draft pick to choose a prize of his/her choice until there are no
longer any prizes left. Tied entrants who both select the same prize will be
decided between by a flip of the coin, the loser receiving his second choice.
61212: Authors and official betatesters may vote, but must head their votes
with the subject: "MISS CONGENIALITY VOTE" so that the counter is able to
seperate them. These votes will be counted towards an author's best of show
choice. The winner will receive a copy of "The Interactive Writer's Handbook",
donated by me.
61471: The text adventure you enter must be winnable in under two hours. Judges
will be asked to rate it after playing for that long. Please note that your
game will NOT be disqualified if it exceeds this length, but judges may not see
it in its entirety before rating it.
61867: This year, do NOT post your entries ahead of time. Jumping the gun is
punishable by disqualification. Instead, you will need to send me your entries
privately, either through e-mail (as a uuencoded file) or some other
arrangement that you will have to work out with me. The entries must be
received by September 30th, 1996. No entries will be accepted after this date.
62164: de on October 1st, 1996. Only entries uploaded by me will be eligible.
62221: If you want your entry to be anonymous, then leave your name off it and
email me that it's your entry. I advise a secret command that pops up the
author and copyright message. Anonymity is not required, and I hope to be able
to continue to do this in the future.
62408: Speaking of copyright, all games must be entirely your own creations.
You may parody established works, but you may not, for example, write a game
based on Sherlock Holmes. This avoids the entire issue of copyright and the
ethics involved.
62581: All entries MUST be freeware or public domain. So don't enter a game
you've worked on for 2 years if you don't want to give it away. No shareware,
no donorware, no commercial products, etc. Only clear and free games.
63086: nough time has been spent on a single puzzle. I don't care how you do
it, but do it. Any entry without something of this nature will be returned to
its author, and the author will be asked to rectify the oversight.
63618: copy of the Magnetic Scrolls Collection which includes Fish, Corruption
and the Guild of Thieves, donated by Colm McCarthy.

"One-of-a-kind deluxe
scraps of paper with stuff written on them"
registered version of "The Light:
Shelby's Addendum", signed, with hint sheets and maps, and a whole mess of
scribblings that no-one in their right mind would ever want, donated by Colm
McCarthy.

One free copy of "Avalon", whenever it's done, donated by the
author, me, as if you didn't know.
63981: Cecilia Barajas of Activision (Author of Zork Nemesis) has donated the
following items:
-A copy of "Lost Treasures of Infocom vols. 1 and 2." (to be
awarded as a matched set.)
-A copy of "Zork Nemesis."
-A Zork Nemesis t-shirt
64421: Lastly, assuming that:

1) We have at least 20 entries in the
competition. (By that, I mean 20 valid, on-time, non-disqualified entries.)

2)
At least 5 of the entries are done by female authors.
64576: Then Christopher Forman will also award five free registrations of
"Circle of Armageddon", Volume 2 of "The Windhall Chronicles".

Thank you to
all prize contributors for helping to make this yeat's contest a reality.
64738: All games entered in this year's competition are freeware. You may play
any of them without being expected to pay a fee, mail a postcard, or even blow
your nose.
64855: All games are copyrights of the respective authors. I make no claims on
them, but I do disclaim that any games that violate another's copyrights are in
violation of the rules set down for this competition.
65002: Lastly, for those of you unfamiliar with the online resources available
to text adventure authors, here are some interesting sources.
65113: e/if-archive/
Main directory for the interactive fiction (text
adventure) archive. It is mirrored at several sites, but the info escapes me
for the moment.
65242: e/if-archive/programming/
The location of several programs designed to
help authors write text adventures. I recommend TADS, Inform, Hugo, Alan, or
AGT, particularly the first two: TADS and Inform. Please see the relevant
directories for further info.
65477: ase
The main document for Whizzard's Guide to Text Adventure Authorship.
This is something I wrote to give ideas to prospective authors, mostly dealing
with the non-technical aspects of writing text adventures.
65680: file by Graham Nelson also discussing the less technical aspects of how
to write text adventures. Included is a Player's Bill of Rights that is very
useful.
65896: Newsgroups:
65923: NT-FICTION
For the use of text adventure authors in discussing the
mechanics and other important topics of text adventure creation. Important
contest announcements will be posted here.
66074: INT-FICTION

hints, and to buy/sell used text adventures.
66251: "Third time's the charm."
-Most Common Programmer Saying, right after
"&$%&@%!!"
66460: I'm sure you'll be pleased to hear that. You'll be even happier when you
find out that there is an annual competition on the Internet to see who can
write the best text adventure, and that you can enter it, or judge the entries,
for free.
66630: This year's competition is a bit different in that the rules are
stricter and better defined. Violaters of any rule will be given a warning the
first time, and disqualified if a second transgression is made. Sorry for the
harsh crackdown, but it seems to be neccessary to ensure a tranquil and
pleasant competition for all.
66857: 1. Any text adventure you enter must be winnable in under two hours. The
judges are only allowed to play it that long before quitting and rating it.
This is to ensure small games, and encourage authors to enter who might feel
intimidated going up against a huge game.
67046: 2. All games must be entirely your own creations. You may parody
established works, but you may not, for example, write a game based on Sherlock
Holmes. This avoids the entire issue of copyright and the ethics involved.
67205: 3. All entries MUST be freeware or public domain. So don't enter a game
you've worked on for 2 years if you don't want to give it away. No shareware,
no donorware, no commercial products, etc. Only clear and free games.
67370: 4. All entries must be previously unreleased at the opening of voting.
If an entry has previously been circulated, it will be disqualified. If you are
unsure whether your game fails to meet this rule, please ask me.
67525: 5. Authors of a competition entry may not discuss the entries in a
public Internet forum while the voting is open. This means don't post about
your entry (or anyone else's) on a newsgroup until the deadline for voting has
passed.
67690: 1. It is recommended that you enclose a complete text walkthrough with
your game. With a walkthrough, I can doublecheck your entry to ensure that it
is winnable, and judges can get by hard puzzles to see the rest of your game.
67851: 2. The entry may be written in any programming language, including any
of the text adventure creation utilities available (such as TADS, Inform, AGT,
or Alan, to name a few.)  If your game is unplayable, then it won't receive
enough votes to be eligable for prizes. (See Judging.)
68062: 3. Multiple entries by the same author are fine, so long as all entries
meet all the rules above. Let me just close this with a caveat emptor. You will
likely be better off investing more time in a single entry rather than trying
to finish two.
68235: 4. To enter this year, you must e-mail me by September 1, 1997, with
your intent to enter. I will assign you an author number, and a telnet-accessed
e-mail address that you can receive feedback on your game at until the voting
period has ended.
68416: 5. You will need to e-mail me your entry privately, either through
e-mail (as a uuencoded file) or some other arrangement that you will have to
work out with me. The entries must be received by September 30th, 1997. No
entries will be accepted after this date.
68606: 1. The winner will be the game with the highest average score. Each
winner will have a draft pick to choose a prize of his/her choice until there
are no longer any prizes left. Tied entrants who both select the same prize
will be decided between by a flip of the coin, the loser receiving his second
choice.
68823: The Prizes So Far Include:
69204: mause. 

Trophies will be awarded for first, second, and third place in
addition to the normal prize picks.

Trophies donated by Kevin Wilson. This is
likely to be a fairly expensive prospect, so donations of money (or
trophy-making talents) are needed this year as well. 

If you would like to
donate a prize for this year's competition, please contact me as soon as
possible with your prize. The competition is dependent on prize donations from
interested parties to boost interest and the number of entrants.
70206: you will receive an automated reply describing the use of the remailer.


Due to load constraints on the machine that the mailer is running on, I will
only be giving accounts for use with the IF competition. If you want a remailer
account for general use, you should look elsewhere. Thank you for
understanding."

It was later added that even if
someone does not want to enter anonymously, they may still use this remailer
for use in the competition.
70791: There is no blurb on that!
70822: Unfortunately, this interpreter does not allow you to play another game
within this one. To play the game, exit and run the one you want to play. For
more information about how this works, read the blurb on the game you wish to
play, or simply 'READ <game>'
71020: You can only rate the games!
71046: Please sort the games you can play before you try to rate them. Simply
put all games you can play in the 'playable' bin, the games you can't into the
'unplayable', and pull the lever.
71182: I thought you said you couldn't play that game! If you can, you'll have
to pull the lever again and re-sort the games.
71398: Rating the games out of order, huh? I'll let you get away with it, but
you better have a good reason,...
Anyway, "
71538: You can only give a rating between one and ten.
71583: Please sort the games you can play before you try to rate them. Simply
put all games you can play in the 'playable' bin, the games you can't into the
'unplayable', and pull the lever.
71790: There is no game with that ranking right now.
71882: Chndon't have any games available to rate yet.

leading back down into the darkness from which you came. Though you got here
late, it looks like those who came before had a great time.
75924: You climb the walls for a bit, but it doesn't help.
75964: There doesn't seem to be any way out other than the way you got here.

76124: This is the bin in which to put games which are unplayable on your
computer.
76184: This is the bin where the games start out. The games in the playable bin
can't be sorted (by pulling the lever) until this bin is empty, and no games

78344: Looking more closely, you see cables going from the various bins into
the wall just below the lever.
78416: All the games have blurbs on them. I'm afraid you'll have to be more
specific (or just 'READ <game>').
78498: A piece of paper is tacked to one wall, with instructions.
78544: "To find out about a particular system (like Inform) just type 'READ AN
INFORM GAME' (The same will work with TADS, AGT, and the rest of the game types
in this competition.)"
78688: It's a Big Red Button Which, If You Push It, Will Make You Do Everything
You Really Need To Do Automatically. What more do you want to know?
78800: Inside the bins are representations of the various games in this
contest. You can examine an individual game to get basic information about it,
and to find out what rating you've given it. If you would like more detailed
information, you can 'READ THE BLURB ON <game>' or simply 'READ <game>'. The
blurb will give you the title and subtitle of the game, the directory where you
can find it, and information about the interpreter(s) you can use to play it.
79136: When all of the games are sorted into either the 'playable' or
'unplayable' bin, the light will turn green, and you can pull the lever. This
will cause a rack to rotate into the room, and all of the games from the
'playable' bin will be moved to this rack, sorted in a random order. If you
find you have made a mistake, or wish to re-sort your games, pull the lever
again, and it will deposit the games from the rack back into the 'playable'
bin, where you can re-arrange them.
79470: The rack, when it appears, will hold all the games you indicated you
could play, in a random order. A game must be inside the rack before you can
rate it, which you can do by typing 'RATE <game> <number>', where <number> is a
number (integer) between one and ten. The idea here is that you play the first
game on your list first, then the next, and so on, until you either finish or
run out of time. You can rate as you go, or wait until you finish and rate them
then. You can always change your old ratings, and the program will not insist
on you rating them in order (though it will comment on it).

(The formatting is
based on a fixed-width font, and assumes a screen width at least a few
characters wider than the longest game name. I apologize if it looks bad on
your interpreter.)
80534: At any rate, if it works, you can use this file to mail to the vote
collector, if you wish.
80600: This really needs no extensive documentation, as it does precisely what
its title implies. You can think of it as an automatic 'walkthrough' for this
game. All the typed commands you see yourself executing would actually work if
you typed them yourself. The first, 'GET ALL GAMES FROM EVERYWHERE' is
hardwired into this game, and can be shortened to 'GET ALL GAMES' or even 'GET
ALL' (since the games are the only objects around you need to carry.)
80944: Once all the games are sorted, you may refer to the first game on the
list which you haven't rated as 'next', as in EXAMINE NEXT or RATE NEXT. This
is a convenience so you don't have to look at the rack each time you want to
figure out which game is next on the docket.
81204: November 30, 1996 - The voting account will close. No further votes will
be accepted after midnight on this date. (Midnight for the person whose account
this is. Save yourself grief and vote early.)

December 1-5, 1996 - The winners
of the competition will be announced at various places of interest on the
internet.
81438: The Judging system this year was debated at large, and it was finally
decided that this game would indeed be official. Whizzard hasn't published a
revised Judging section yet, but as far as I can tell, it will be the same as
last year, with the exception that partial judging entries are allowable. This
still means that if you can by any means judge all the games, you should do so.
But if you can't, you should judge them in a randomized order, whether through
this game or in some other manner. In any case, please judge as many as you
can, so that we will have statistically significant results.

Betatesters may
vote in the main competition this year, unlike last year. There are currently
no plans for a MISS CONGENIALITY award for votes from game authors, but there
have been rumors of a desire for one amongst some of us. Presumably, once we
have an official vote counter, we could bug them to collate separate MISS
CONGENIALITY votes, or we can organize one ourselves. Bugging Whizzard about it
is probably NOT the way to go, since he's tired, overworked, and cranky ;-)
82224: it doesn't, not really. I intended this game as a tool, nothing more. If
you don't like it, push the Big Red Button and quit. If you do like it, use it
as a scratchpad to record your ratings and print them out. Use it to find where
the odd interpreters reside on the archive, or to find out if your platform has
a new interpreter somewhere. If you absolutely hate it, either rate all the
games or find another way to choose which games to play first. Any option will
work.
