132136: To simplify the problem of dialogue in interactive fiction, the "tell"
and "ask" commands are not used in this game. Type "about" for details.
132228: You can't connect something to itself.
132252: You can't touch something to itself.

132350: For acknowledgements and credits, please type "credits".
132394: An introductory note: To simplify the problem of dialogue in
interactive fiction, the "tell" and "ask" commands are not used in this game.
Your conversational options are limited to "yes," "no," and saying nothing at
all. Trust me -- this isn't as big a deal as it sounds.
132568: Also, after some consideration, I have decided not to implement body
parts -- head, arms, legs, hands -- as separate objects. If you feel a desire
to refer to yourself, "me" will suffice.
132690: It is possible to make a fatal mistake in this game, but you will
immediately know you have done so. You can always "undo" after death, and then
fix the mistake. Therefore, the game is best played straight through. Accept
any non-fatal mistakes that you may make; you will have a second chance. If you
back up and replay each scene for maximum efficiency, avoiding all mistakes,
certain aspects of the game will be lost.
132948: However -- you will eventually reach a point where things become
dangerous. You'll know when. Beyond that, you're playing for keeps and
heartbeats count. Save early and often.
133080: A Change in the Weather.
133096: It's not. In a certain sense, this is my first conventional game. In
another sense, it's the strangest game I know, and understanding what's
happening is entirely your problem.
133208: This game is free. But if you feel like sending me money, I won't
refuse. If you feel like sending me comments or bug reports, I'll be ecstatic.
As of the beginning of 1998, I am at
133398: This game was created using the Inform adventure development system,
which was created by Graham Nelson. You can get Inform, as well as other text
adventures, from the Interactive Fiction archive:
133528: I did not, I swear, create this game to be an entry in the Third
Interaction Fiction Competition. I did briefly consider entering it... when the
entry deadline came around at the end of August 1997, I thought I might be able
to finish by the submission deadline a month later. Maybe I could have. It
would probably have been a mistake. In any case, I decided not to try.
133776: actually hit me in February 1997, on a stretch of road crossing under
Route 32, as I was walking towards Borders. There were ducks nearby. I don't
think the ducks had anything to do with the idea; but they get listed in the
credits anyway.
133938: have something to do with the idea. In particular, his story "Casting
Fortune."
133990: Lovely Alex, for inspiring me to quit my job and therefore giving me
the time to write this.
134048: Beta testers: Julian Arnold, Miron Schmidt (and his arm), C. E. Forman,
Michael Kinyon. Beta-and-a-half testers: Adam Thornton, Stephen Granade, Lucian
P. Smith.
134178: Omega testers: Send me bug reports, and your name could win valuable
real estate in this listing!
134244: Come to think of it: In February, the ducks wouldn't have been there.
Well, you get the idea.
134304: The following information is internal data, of interest only to the
author.
134396: You say "Yes," nodding vigorously. [BUG]
134424: You say "No," rolling your eyes. [BUG]
134452: You fail to answer the question which has not been asked. How Zen.
[BUG]
134496: The man says, "That was a rhetorical question." [BUG]
134532: The man says, "Don't be so negative." [BUG]
134560: You blink away sharp edges of memory, and the dim walls slowly emerge
into your sight once again. Dark metal walls and air uncomfortably cool. And
cool metal bands around your wrists and feet and forehead.
134690: He leans forward over his desk, through the glow of his monitors and
controls. Impatience tightens his face.
134762: You blink away memory. The dim room comes again into focus, and the man
behind the desk.
134816: You are in a dim room, bounded by metal walls, and you sit restrained
in a steel chair. Across from you is a desk covered with panels of
instrumentation. The man faces you from behind it.
134926: The desk is panelled with ranks of controls and instruments. All, of
course, are angled just too low for you to read.
135000: The walls are naked metal, unadorned. They give your eyes nowhere to
rest.
135046: There is a doorway off to the side, to the south.
135074: The man follows your gaze, and raises an eyebrow.
135110: The man follows your gaze, and shakes his head.
135144: The doorway is too far to the side of your vision. You cannot clearly
see what lies in the whiteness beyond it.
135208: The chair is every bit as uncomfortable as its designers must have
intended. Metal slats dig into your thighs and shoulders. Your head is strapped
back, with too many cold itches where the leads are pasted on. And, of course,
the steel bands that bind your hands and feet. You can hardly forget those.
135408: Your hands and feet are locked in place.
135432: Not likely. You might wiggle a finger or two.
135460: The chair is far stronger than you.
135484: You can't do that while sitting in it.
135508: The metal under your fingers is chill and slick with sweat.
135544: You can't see your temples, nor reach with your hands, but the itch has
never quite faded where the sensor leads are pasted on. The contacts are cold,
too. And behind the cold is an echo of the blinding light.
135660: You hold no wish dearer. But while your hands are restrained, it won't
happen.
135708: If you could move your hands, you would have scratched hours ago.
135748: Steel cuffs encircle your wrists and ankles, locking you to the chair.
The heft of the bands leaves nothing to chance.
135816: The metal is cool, slick with sweat, and utterly immobile.
135852: You twist your limbs against the metal bands.
135880: It does as much good as you expected.
135908: You succeed only in scraping your raw wrists further.
135942: The man smiles faintly at your efforts.
135972: Noticing your movements, the man begins to speak. Then he cuts himself
off and waves the words away.
136036: He is greying of hair and lined, lined hard, not wrinkled. His pale
uniform fits as comfortably as skin. It is immaculate; it bears no insignia but
the emblem of his nation.
136168: "Perhaps you don't understand who's in charge here."
136236: The man wears the light tan uniform of his nation, and its emblem on
his breast.
136284: Your toolcase is lying nearby, closed.
136310: Your toolcase is lying nearby, open and empty.
136342: Your toolcase is lying open nearby. Inside
136420: You open the toolcase, and find it empty.
136472: The toolcase is lined with foam padding, neatly shaped into hollows for
the various tools that the case holds.
136536: The foam padding is part of the case.
136556: The foam is shaped to hold your four tools (lamp, scan scrambler, blast
tab, acid pack), your five triggers (button, switch, timer, voice remote, key
remote), the two remote transmitters, and the lockpick. But aren't you a little
busy to be worrying about that?
136724: The number and shapes of the hollows aren't important.
136756: The pick is a silver rod the size of your ring finger -- not true
silver, of course, nothing so easily scanned. It's splayed at one end into a
flat disc
136848: of conductor-web matrix. The status dot is blue.
136880: You'd better not. You'd probably fry the lockpick's subcircuitry.
136924: The pick is in standby; it'll activate when you put it on task.
136968: The rod is smooth and light, quick to pick up the heat of your fingers.
137012: The rod isn't flexible, you understand.
137084: . Its status dot flashes to yellow.
137108: The pick comes free with a faint magnetic snap. The status dot flashes
red once, and goes blue.
137168: The pick comes free with a faint magnetic snap.
137236: The lockpick's status dot is sliding towards green.
137270: The lockpick's status dot fades to pure green, but then it flashes red
twice. The door does not move.
137336: The lockpick's status dot fades to pure green, but then it flashes red
twice. The door does not move.
137400: The lockpick's status dot fades to pure green, and flicks steady blue.
137476: The lockpick widens at the top, ending in a coin-sized disc with the
woven gleam of conductor-web matrix.
137540: The familiar weave slides across your thumb.
137572: You can't connect something to itself.
137596: You can't connect two negative links together.
137624: You can't connect something to itself.
137648: You can't connect two positive links together.
137704: It's a small purple cube, which contains enough stabilized gel to blow
a foot-wide hole in approximately anything. There's a minus link on one edge
137832: Crack!
137844: Crack!
137852: . You feel no pain; just the white tide of shock and cold that rolls
across you, and washes the blood away.
137920: Crack!
137968: You plummet to the ground with them, clutching grey fragments in your
bloodied fists.
138020: Crack!
138028: , tearing a hole right through the door. Your positioning was precise;
the locking mechanism is shredded, and the door begins to sag open...
138116: Crack!
138124: . You feel no pain; just the white tide of shock and cold that rolls
across you, and washes the blood away.
138216: Crack!
138348: It's a small brown cone, covered with tiny pores. It contains a
pressurized capsule of a rather clever catalytic acid, which eats through most
metals like a blowtorch but is harmless to anything else.
138468: (Well, fairly harmless. It does itch miserably.)
138528: The status dot flashes blue. Unsurprisingly, nothing happens.
138588: The status dot flashes green. Unsurprisingly, nothing happens.
138732: An acrid mist fills the corridor. The door, however, is untouched; its
coating must be steadfastly inert.
138832: An acrid mist fills the room. Cabinets twist and buckle in the spray,
falling to rags of metal, spilling papers across the floor.
138944: An acrid mist fills the room. The locker doors etch and burn; holes
appear, gape wide, and a thousand things peer through from behind.
139056: pits and scars, but is not seriously damaged. The filing cabinet, in
contrast, twists and buckles, falling to empty rags of metal.
139172: An acrid mist fills the room. The walls scar and decay, layers of metal
falling away to show more metal beneath. The chair crumples like wet paper; in
moments there is nothing of it but rags of corrosion.
139294: You hear a brief, piercing hiss from somewhere nearby.
139408: You watch, awed and pleased at once, as the steel wrench sublimes away.
139456: pits and scars, but apparently the metallurgy is more advanced than
your people predicted. The door is not seriously damaged.
139532: Disappointingly, there is no vulnerable metal nearby.
139572: It's a small orange pyramid, traced with conductor matrix. It can
detect and scramble scan-web on any frequency... or so the theory is drawn.
139664: It's active and humming faintly.
139684: Now, you suspect, it's an expensive paperweight. You must have brought
it into a countermeasure induction field.
139776: The scrambler vibrates very gently against your fingers.
139812: You catch a fading whiff of burnt insulation.
139840: The scrambler hums gently to itself.
139864: The scrambler's status dot flickers black.
139892: The scrambler's status dot goes green, and an almost inaudible whine
begins within it.
139948: The scrambler's status dot flickers black.
139976: The scrambler's status dot flashes briefly yellow.
140012: The scrambler's status dot flickers black.
140040: The scrambler shuts down, and its status dot goes blue.
140108: . There's a minus link on one edge of the tube
140136: You see some lamp guts. An electroluminescent element, presumably.
140180: The minilamp glows for a moment, then goes out.
140296: That's not something you can switch off.
140364: The link dot flashes green in confirmation, but as the switch isn't
linked to anything, that's all.
140420: The link dot flashes blue in confirmation, but as the switch isn't
linked to anything, that's all.
140536: You can set the timer's green dial or its blue dial.
140568: The status dot goes green, but as the timer isn't linked to anything,
that's all.
140618: The status dot goes blue, but as the timer isn't linked to anything,
that's all.
140752: The timer whimpers, "Stop me!" [BUG]
140776: The dial can be set from 1 to 20.
140820: Nothing happens; the contact doesn't click no matter how hard you thump
it. The timer seems to have failed completely now.
140896: Nothing happens; you squeeze harder, until the contact finally clicks.
140944: lights as you press it. The timer's indicator flashes to
141012: Both dials go out, and the timer's indicator goes blank.
141204: You press the transmitter key. As you expected, nothing happens; the
cursed thing is still broken, jammed, or sabotaged.
141336: You press the key, and the status dot flashes green, but you perceive
no other effect.
141388: That's not something you can switch off.
141456: The audio keywords are printed along one edge.
141544: You say the keyword, and the status dot flashes green, but you perceive
no other effect.
141650: You say the keyword, and the status dot flashes blue, but you perceive
no other effect.
141704: The keywords for the voice transmitter are "tango" to switch on, and
"waltz" to switch off. In your voiceprint only, of course.
141784: The keywords are only there as a reminder.
141812: It's your lockpick, yes. A silver rod the size of your ring finger,
splayed at one end into a flat disc of conductor-web matrix. You can't make
out, from this distance, whether it's undamaged.
141928: The lockpick widens at the top, ending in a coin-sized disc with the
woven gleam of conductor-web matrix.
141992: It's an ordinary-looking pen. It's hard to tell from this distance, but
the nib appears to be missing, and there seems to be a dark stain on the tip of
the casing.
142112: The man shakes his head again. "This is clearly flying to nowhere. You
want to be stubborn; well." He touches a sequence of controls.
142222: "Yes, your acid compound. It sounds fascinating; I'd like to play with
it sometime." He cocks his head. "If you ever give us any to play with. You
didn't really spray it everywhere
142464: "I thought not. We certainly didn't find any traces of the stuff." The
man touches a control.
142526: "Well, we didn't find any traces of the stuff. I think it rather more
likely that you never set the capsule off at all." The man touches a control.
142658: of its contents. Believe me, our chemistry people would be delighted if
we had." The man touches a control before you can respond.
142742: He is frankly impressed. "It works that quickly?"
142844: . And we found the wrench sitting on the crate, unharmed
142880: "Lovely. I must watch the results sometime. Because," he adds,
142924: "Pity of that. I must see the actual results sometime. Because," he
adds,
142972: "Nothing forthcoming? After inventing that remarkable show for me?
Because," he adds,
143030: "And the noise went completely unnoticed," says the man, an eyebrow
raised.
143268: "Don't be absurd," he continues, as if you had answered. "
143390: The man sighs. "I would be very pleased if you would stop playing with
your toys, and get back to what truly happened." He presses a control before
you can reply.
143496: The man is staring at you as if at a joke he doesn't, quite,
understand. "And then you died."
143558: The man shakes his head in disgust.
143582: "No, you, let's see, you just grew a new hand, cleaned up all the
blood, reassured the guards that the 'bang' was all in their heads..." The man
shakes his head in disgust.
143686: The man shakes his head in disgust.
143710: "Yes, yes, you're dead. And I'm the Bright-Wings come to take you away
to the Isles. Can we dispense with this?" He presses a control on his desk.
143810: "No, I see, you're dead and this is your life running back before your
eyes. I must say you had very dull taste in decor." He presses a control on his
desk.
143914: On the whole, it was worth the trip. The plains really were broad and
grain-gold, if scarred with fences and agricultural crawlers. The mountains
were overwhelming. And however much of the capital city is scarred with squat
brick and faceless concrete hulks, there are still flashes of its historic
charm.
144106: This alley, however, has no time for charm. It ends in flat bare dirty
brick, and a door which lacks even the courtesy of a handle. Not that you'll
wait on courtesy.
144264: The door opens, only it's ajar. Ha! [BUG]
144288: "Don't be absurd," he says. "You're no more a sightseer than the Old
Tree in Capitol Square; and if you'd had enough sense to walk away from that
door, you wouldn't be here. You don't and you didn't and are; we caught you.
And you're going to start by telling me how you got through that door. Do you
understand me?"
144486: The man nods briefly -- a man satisfied with the least important
detail. He touches a control. Once again, a faint whine begins to drill through
your temples.
144576: The man blinks, and gazes at you. "That's a lie. You're not stupid.
Understand me --
144808: The man nods, apparently satisfied, and touches a control. Once again,
a faint whine begins to drill through your temples.
144882: The man's lips tighten. "I believe you. I won't waste any more of your
time, then." He touches a sequence of controls.
144962: The man shakes his head. "Let's try again."

He touches a control. Once
again, a faint whine begins to drill through your temples.
145036: "This is tedious," the man says. "Of course you didn't walk up and
stand there rattling the door like a nightclump. Nor did you blow through the
keyhole." Clenched knuckles rap on the desk, tension at odds with his patient
tone. "Nor, I add, did you break into this place barehanded and bare naked. You
had something which opened that door, and you used it. Was it this?"

His fist
opens abruptly. Something rod-shaped gleams silver in his palm.
145312: "Some sort of electronic key? An inductive code-scanner?" He holds the
silver rod out towards you.
145382: "I thought it might be." He turns the rod over in his fingers, once.
"Small. But clearly functional. ...Show me."
145466: yours. A guard found it inside, just before we caught you, and it's
nothing of ours. So don't pretend you didn't carry it in."
145550: yours. A guard found it inside, just before we caught you, and it's
nothing of ours. So don't pretend you didn't carry it in. Now let's try again."
145648: Not through a brick wall, you don't.
145672: It's a narrow dead end here, with walls rising oppressively high in
three directions. The alley is quite empty, bare even of trash.
145824: The alley ends here.
145872: It's a naked sheet of metal, a foot taller than you, as wide as your
outstretched arms. No handle, no keyhole, no label, no sign. No obvious way to
open it at all, unless the black plate embedded beside it will serve.
146008: The door is very definitely closed.
146028: You scrape your knuckles without result. There isn't even any sound;
it's like knocking on the side of a mountain.
146100: The door is flush with the wall, and there's no space around the edges
to work your fingers into.
146152: There's no space under the door.
146172: A featureless, dull black rectangle is embedded in the bricks beside
the door. It's about the width of your palm. No fool could doubt the plate has
something to do with opening the door, but it doesn't bear a clue about how to
do it.
146310: The lockpick is clinging to the plate.
146356: You're in the entrance of a narrow brick alley, which runs further in
to the north. To the south a broad street courses by, congested with traffic
and bicycles, although none of them seem to notice you.
146476: This is a dull section of the city, run a bit down, which is why you're
nosing around in alleys. You can see tenement steps on the far side of the
street. A few children in school uniforms lean there, but you can't see much
through the cars that crowd by.
146618: You can't leave. You have a job to do.
146644: You leave door and alley behind, and set off to see what else this fine
city might hold.
146696: Traffic pours down the street -- bicycles, the boxy cars of local make,
the occasional pedestrian taking his chances.
146772: The children are on the far side of the street.
146800: The walls are brownish brick, not recently washed. They stretch at
least two stories above you.
146864: The bricks are narrowly mortared. There's not a bit of hold to grasp.
146908: It's just bricks. They stop for the door, and the small plate next to
it, but everywhere else they're implacably solid.
146984: The bricks are rough, and not very clean.
147010: The door opens, only it's ajar. Ha! Ha! [BUG]
147042: The man turns the lockpick again in his fingers. "This is nice, this
truly is. We have nothing like it." A thoughtful blink. "...And this was the
only piece of equipment you carried?"
147164: The man winces. "I truly can't believe that. If you had one such clever
trick, you had others.
147224: "Naturally not. I look forward to examining the others.
147260: The man drops his eyes for a moment, then meets yours again... perhaps
with a hint of a smile. "And you remain stubborn. It matters little.
147352: The man shakes his head. "Suddenly silent... I had thought we were
doing well. But
147408: I truly won't believe that you brought no other clever tricks.
147448: Not," he adds, "that they did you good in the end."
147482: "They did? Little enough, as you're the one in the chair." He shakes
his head dismissively. "Let's continue. You entered the complex..."
147572: "No." He shrugs sympathetically. "Let's continue. You entered the
complex..."
147704: weak. Are we." A sharp look from those eyes. "Let's continue. You
entered the complex..."
147764: "And then all the guards came thundering down on you? Captured before
you'd done anything at all?"
147826: "You certainly were not. There was no alarm and we both know it. Now
let's have it again."
147884: "Of course not. So don't pretend you set off any alarms. Now let's have
it again."
147938: Now the man does look impatient. "There was no alarm -- not then, and
not later -- and we both know it. Now let's have it again."
148022: "We've been over this. We track all metal within the critical zones. I
know you're good; you surely noticed the ceiling web."
148106: metal past it. Stop wasting my time." He punches a control, harder than
necessary.
148164: metal past it. Stop wasting my time." He punches a control, harder than
necessary.
148220: "As you like. But it's there, and you didn't
148248: metal past it. Stop wasting my time." He punches a control, harder than
necessary.
148304: "This is tiring. I've been in this base all day and I heard no alarm."
The man touches a control before you can respond.
148380: The man raises an eyebrow. "None of those guards saw you until much
later. Shall we try it again?"
148446: "That was a rhetorical question." The man touches a control.
148490: "...with the metal of the wrench hidden from our ever-watchful scan
web. A wonderful artifact, your little orange pyramid." The man spreads his
hands in assumed awe, then shakes his head. "I don't think your techniques are
quite that good. You could muffle the metal signature, I would say, but not
perfectly. It would leave eddies. Small ones -- within the error tolerances of
our scan, enough to hide the wrench for a few minutes -- but after that? A
dozen acceptable errors within ten minutes is... not acceptable at all.

"And
we picked up no such suspicious sequence; and therefore, you did not
148876: the wrench across that line. Did you."
148898: He stares at you for a moment. "Even if you claim your scrambler works
perfectly," he continues, "...we found the wrench sitting on the crate in the
closet." He smiles briefly.
149016: He reaches for his controls. "And besides," he adds, "we found the
wrench sitting on the crate." He smiles briefly.
149092: He reaches for his controls. "And besides," he adds, "we found the
wrench sitting on the crate." He smiles briefly.
149168: "We've been over this. You could only have prevented us from detecting
the wrench for a few minutes -- and we
149342: crate. That's where we found it. I have to get these minor matters
clear, you understand, or the important ones will never be straightened out."
149464: . It's a small matter but I can't let it slip."
149494: "I believe you're forgetting something." The man gazes at you levelly.
"Our forensics people went over the area very thoroughly after we captured you.
And we found evidence that you'd been up in that open ceiling panel in the
northwest corner. Did you think you could hide that from us?"
149670: The man leans back, watching you.
149694: "You did? You can cover up memories, perhaps..." Unexpectedly, he
smiles. "But 'Blood speaks loud where words fade away.' Eh? Now, this time, the
truth."
149802: "Not, certainly, if you're going to go bleeding all over the place. Now
show me."
149856: He shakes his head. "You can't. You can cover up memories, perhaps..."
Unexpectedly, he smiles. "But 'Blood speaks loud where words fade away.' Eh?
Now, this time, the truth."
149976: "You're forgetting the blood traces again. Don't pretend you didn't
jump up
150028: to that missing panel. Now, what did you do there?
150092: He looks almost amused. "Yes, yes. You swung from a ceiling panel, you
bled a drop of blood, we found a drop of blood, everything is made clear as
sunlight."
150196: " the man breathes, and now he doesn't look amused at all. "You were,
what, just bored? Taking a bit of exercise? You were up there for a
150292: don't tell me you weren't. There isn't anything in that space now; we
checked four times. So you jumped up there to take something away. I want to
know
150396: I'm astonished," the man breathes, and now he doesn't look amused at
all. "You weren't just taking a bit of exercise?" He exhales. "There isn't
anything in that space now; we checked four times. So you jumped up there to
take something away. I want to know
150576: give me that look," the man breathes, and now he doesn't look amused at
all. "You were, what, just bored? Taking a bit of exercise? You were up there
for a
150684: don't tell me you weren't. There isn't anything in that space now; we
checked four times. So you jumped up there to take something away. I want to
know
150784: "You're dodging the question," the man says, more calmly now. "The
ceiling panel." He touches a control.
150930: "Yes, yes, but we've been going back over your trail. Whatever your
mysterious package is, you didn't leave it behind." He touches a control.
151072: Four times, as I believe I mentioned.
151128: "Of course, by now -- that is, by then -- there was once again an
observer covering the alley door. Your original diversion was clever but brief.
So you certainly didn't re-open the door, much less leave and then re-enter."
He touches a control.
151274: "That would be the logistics office. Five agents working at the time,
very diligent men and women. None of whom recall their door popping open on
them." He shakes his head. "Your electronic key is a lovely toy, but you don't
have to play with it for my sake." He touches a control.
151440: in a bare tiled corridor, white tiles and cold white walls. The ceiling
is acoustical panelling divided by
151508: strips of plastic. The hall runs north and east, with a branch curving
away to the southeast.
151566: You return up the hallway as it curves around to the south.
151604: The white corridor begins here, and curves away north.
151672: It's a naked sheet of metal, a foot taller than you, as wide as your
outstretched arms. Beside it is a black plate which is twin to the one outside.
151764: The door is very definitely closed.
151784: You scrape your knuckles without result. There isn't even any sound;
it's like knocking on the side of a mountain.
151856: The door is flush with the wall, and there's no space around the edges
to work your fingers into.
151908: You reach the outside world, and win. Er. I think. [BUG]
151940: The door slides open, and daylight spills over you. So does a sharp
buzzer; and, moments later, three armed guards.
152014: A buzzer sounds. Moments later, three guards charge towards you,
weapons drawn.
152072: The hallway runs both east and south from here. There's a featureless
metal door to the west, which is closed; a more normal one stands
152150: One of the ceiling panels is missing, leaving a rectangular gap. You
are clinging to the lip of the hole; your feet dangle a foot above the ground.
152240: The northern door is comfortingly ordinary -- white paint, hinges, and
a handle which needs nothing more sophisticated than fingers. The door is
152320: The door to the west is metal. It has no handle; another black plate is
visible beside it. The door is closed.
152408: The metal door slides open. Beyond, several people are working at
cluttered desks. One looks up absently, and then stares; and then a loud buzzer
echoes down the hall. Moments later, three guards charge towards you, weapons
drawn.
152550: A buzzer sounds. Moments later, three guards charge towards you,
weapons drawn.
152608: A bare expanse of dirty concrete is visible through the gap.
152644: The concrete ceiling is out of reach.
152664: The concrete is rough and unfinished.
152688: The concrete ceiling is out of reach.
152708: A plastic grille is visible high on the wall, just below the ceiling.
It's hanging open
152784: . In the duct behind it, you can see
152804: You can't see into the grille from down here.
152828: The ventilation duct appears empty.
152852: The grille is barely a foot wide.
152872: Your position is precarious enough without that kind of juggling.
152912: You can't see anything in the ventilation duct.
152938: You reach into the duct with one arm...
152964: The ventilator grille isn't important.
152990: You shift your weight to one hand and reach out -- almost... you swing
yourself desperately, kicking. Your fingers brush the grille. You claw at it, a
wild swipe -- and the grille flops open.
153108: With a bit more flailing, you manage to flip the grille up into place.
153150: One of the ceiling panels is missing, leaving a rectangular gap above
you.
153200: The hole is about two feet by three. Through it, you can see the actual
concrete ceiling, a few inches above the acoustical panelling.
153280: A few drops of your blood are smeared at the edge of the hole.
153344: You can't very well jump when you're hanging by your hands.
153380: You bend and leap. Your fingers brush the edge of the hole -- catch,
and you concentrate on holding on. Your feet swing gently a foot above the
floor.
153472: Uh!
153476: A sharp edge is digging into one finger. You shift your grasp hastily,
but a few drops of blood smear across the hole's lip.
153580: You can't reach that while you're hanging from the ceiling by your
hands.
153812: The space above the ceiling panels is only a few inches high. You can't
fit into it.
153860: From down here, you can see nothing through the hole except the
concrete directly above it.
153908: Your position is precarious enough without that kind of juggling.
153948: You're already holding on to the edge of the hole.
153976: You shift your grip slightly, to ease the strain.
154008: You move your hands a bit, one at a time, to ease the strain.
154044: And a nearby ventilator grille seems to be hissing directly into your
ear.
154090: The tendons of your fingers are complaining.
154118: Your arms are beginning to feel numb.
154144: You grimace, and ignore the pain in your arms. You've been through
worse.
154188: The hole is a foot out of reach.
154292: You strain, pulling yourself up with your arms, until you can see over
the lip of the hole. The space over the acoustical panelling is only a few
inches high; but it spreads out around you into darkness.
154410: The space is empty as far as you can see.
154438: A small package, wrapped in cloth, is sitting on the panelling, just a
few inches from your face.
154500: You can't see anything in the space above the panelling.
154530: You reach up into the space with one arm...
154584: It's an oblong bundle of cloth, a bit larger than your palm.
154620: Whatever's inside the bundle is rigid and rather heavy.
154652: A smear of your blood is visible on one of the light-strips that edge
the missing panel.
154704: The smear of blood is out of reach.
154724: The blood only smears further as you rub at it.
154752: The smear of blood is out of reach.
154776: Your pulse gun is a little smaller than the guards' weapons. Its
outline is sharp, clean, and beautiful.
154844: This room is small and, perhaps, rarely used -- not dirty, but not
quite as clean and white as the corridors. The door to the south is
154924: .

Two rough wooden crates are backed in a corner of the closet.
154964: The only exit is south.
154980: is nailed shut. You can't pry it open with your hands.
155036: Even the smaller crate is too heavy to move.
155064: It's a heavy steel wrench.
155080: You step across the line and continue down the corridor.
155112: As you step across the line, a sharp buzzer echoes through the
corridors.
155154: You step across the line and continue down the corridor... into the
sight of six guards or so, who are posted at the next intersection.
155232: The corridor angles here, and crosses a boundary of some sort as it
does. A few strides down the southeast branch, a dotted red line crosses the
floor. You can retreat from the boundary to the west.
155348: The corridor angles here, and crosses a boundary of some sort as it
does. A few strides down the southeast branch, a dotted red line crosses the
floor. You can retreat from the boundary to the west.
155464: It's just a red marking, painted on the floor tiles southeast of you.
The line is
155510: You toss the wrench across the line.
155534: You toss the wrench across the line; a sharp buzzer immediately sounds.
155584: To the southeast, beginning above the boundary line, the ceiling is
lined with scan-web in addition to the lighting strips. The web's wide spacing
indicates a metal-resonance scan.
155692: The webbing is part of the ceiling to the southeast. It's out of reach.
155728: The door opens, only it's ajar. Ha! Ha! Ha! [BUG]
155760: The man nods with consideration. "And off you went, through our secure
zone like a scalpel through cheese. A plastic scalpel," he adds, smiling
155872: that charming countermeasure device. Even if you
155908: been carrying metal, your orange miracle could only have hidden it for
a few minutes. Thus -- you had none. At
155980: that charming device. As I said, it couldn't have hidden metal for any
length of time. Thus -- you had none. At
156052: least our scan-web keeps spies from carrying guns with them when they
stroll through our bases." He pauses a moment. "Or does your side have
nonmetallic guns now?"
156154: "We've been working on an optical pulse gun core for years, of course.
But no luck, and we'd be very surprised if you'd beaten us to it. I don't
suppose you have?"
156264: We would know if you had such things, and you would know that we
would..."
156312: "No. We would know, and you would know that we would..."
156352: "No, I didn't think you'd answer. But you don't.
156428: We would know if you had such things, and you would know that we
would..."
156476: A silence draws out, and you look to find the man staring at a far
wall, as if you and your chair had dissolved away. Then, thoughtfully, "For all
the effort we put into secrets, my people and yours, do we ever manage to keep
any?" His eyes are on you again.
156636: "Yes, and here you are. Because you don't have
156672: one. And this is the secret that matters. You didn't get it, and we can
keep it just a little longer."
156736: "No, and here you are. Because you don't have
156772: one. And this is the secret that matters. You didn't get it, and we can
keep it just a little longer."
156836: His smile is open now. "Point taken. But
156864: His smile is chilly. "Point taken... for now." His eyes shift up to
your temples. "But
156928: here you are. Because you don't have
156956: secret. And this is the one that matters. You didn't get it, and we can
keep it just a little longer."
157018: "A little longer is all we need."

He shakes his head sharply. "A bit
more time here, as well.
157080: And please don't waste any more of it with fantasy.
157156: I hope you'll continue to cooperate.
157180: Your next move must have been..."
157200: "The squad on Mobile Three, the ones you say stumbled into you. You do
have their images right; I know you saw them. But they say they never saw you.
Did they lie?"
157308: "And you're the expert," he says, scowling. "
157340: "Ah. They'll be hurt to hear so.
157362: But for right now, I'm talking to you. So try it again."
157402: Thank you. Now let's have it again."
157428: The man taps the desk absently. "I don't know what you think to gain.
This is the part of the story that I
157496: verify; Mobile Three was there, even if you slipped by them. The sooner
you run through it, the sooner we can leave.
157572: Or rather," he adds, "the sooner I can leave. You can sit there all
night.
157620: I doubt you're enjoying this either.
157642: "No, understand, this isn't in question. The guards did not see you,
not toenail or eyebrow. They heard a noise, something clattering across the
floor, in the eastern dead-end corridor. That's what they investigated. That's
what you're trying to explain here. Clear?"
157810: The man stares at you. "Enough. I don't need your cooperation." He
touches a sequence of controls.
157906: sense of self-preservation? I'm doing this the long way because I don't
like shredding people. If you play stubborn enough, I'll stop." He punches a
control, harder than necessary.
158028: "Except they didn't see you there." The man touches a control before
you can respond.
158082: "So, most of the story. The guards heard a noise where nothing should
have moved; they ran to investigate. But they did not report seeing
158168: Nor a further rain of mysterious tools on their backs.
158200: Much less a security door opening behind their backs.
158232: I don't think we need to make things any more complicated."
158270: Curiosity raises a brow. "We do? By all means, go on."
158310: Impatience sparks in his eye. "Now, please."
158392: And they said nothing about a suddenly-open door, either.
158462: "Well, except she says she had no idea you existed." The man touches a
control.
158520: "I don't think so. There were people up and down the west corridor
during that interval. You weren't seen back there. Besides, it would hardly be
elegant," and he smiles very suddenly. "We've had that part of the story.
Repeating it would be redundant, yes? Bad art."
158692: "You don't think so? You must not have had my fiction tutor."
158730: "Well, I suppose art isn't the nearest thing to your mind right now."
The man's eyes drop reflectively for a few seconds. "It wouldn't be. I'm
sorry." He touches a control before you can think of a thing to say.
158858: "Well, I suppose art isn't something you care about much," the man says
shortly. He touches a control.
158920: You did not expect to hear a chuckle in this room. "For all the stakes,
it comes down to you telling stories, doesn't it? You spin me a story, and I
listen."
159016: And you've been telling it well.
159092: Anyway." He blinks. "This verse isn't yet right." He touches a control.
159136: "Ah, a pity. Under that banner, this might almost have been a pleasant
process..." He gazes somewhere for a moment. "But I suppose this is too
serious, for you, to be a story." He shakes his head, and touches a control.
159312: Don't fear -- you've been telling it well.
159344: You've been reluctant enough, yes. Well, I'm still listening
regardless.
159392: "Stories or none, I know you haven't been back to the west corridor."
The man touches a control.
159508: The guards never reported seeing any open doors, much less your clever
shadow."
159552: "Stalling isn't going to help. No open doors, no getting caught."
159594: Impatience is plain between his eyes, now. "Yes, you had time to get
inside. But the door, did you notice, would have come open in full view of
Mobile Three? You
159702: notice, in truth, that's what you showed me."

He shakes his head. "But
Three says they didn't see you at all, and they certainly didn't see you
fooling around with that door, and they
159822: didn't enact that tableau at the end. With the guns." He seems
particularly disgusted with that touch, for some reason. "Is it, what, you just
enjoy a dramatic scene?"
159932: "Spare me." He touches a control.
159946: "Then what? You promised your mother six blatant lies every day before
luncheon? No, don't answer that." He touches a control.
160056: "No, no. The guards didn't see the door open; they didn't see you duck
inside; and they didn't see that lockpick fall on the --"

The man's face goes
entirely blank for a moment, and then he's playing controls faster than you can
follow. "Mobile Six? Get back there and check the closet again -- no,
160254: --" Confused noises come from the desk. "Assume there's no time at
all!" the man says, and it's not a shout only because his voice is so low. And
then he turns his gaze back to you.
160400: . It's a small matter but I can't let it slip."
160430: "A streetcorner dazzler would be proud. You distract Mobile Three with
160482: ; when they follow the noise, you walk up the corridor. Yes?"
160524: to Security's attention." He turns a palm out, displaying the silver
rod in his hand. "And it looks, instead, a great deal like your lockpick. Not
that they knew what it was at the time, of course. But we may as well correct
the detail of which object you threw." He touches a control.
160690: "...no, because what the guards found looked a great deal more like
your lockpick." He turns a palm out, displaying the silver rod in his hand.
"Not that they knew what it was at the time, of course. But we may as well
correct the detail of which object you threw." He touches a control.
160904: ' looked a great deal like your lockpick. Or at least it did when the
guards brought it to Security's attention. It hardly matters, as they didn't
know what it was at the time; but we may as well correct the detail." He
touches a control.
161042: "The object that the guards heard was this rod. You aren't going to
convince anyone that it was
161100: ; they brought it straight to me, you understand, to my hand. Well," --
he flicks fingers -- "to my hand, after Security had scanned it seven ways.
Naturally. But here it is." He touches a control before you can reply.
161288: "I realize you're enjoying your story, but there must be other details
you can embellish." He touches a control before you can reply.
161360: "Very dramatic -- a play worthy of a storytale spy. But somehow, I
think the guards would have noticed being blown apart." The man touches a
control before you can respond.
161468: "A play worthy of a storytale spy. But somehow, I think the guards
would have noticed being sprayed with a chemical that would melt their guns,
scar the door beside them, and -- what was it? -- make them itch miserably."
The man touches a control before you can respond.
161632: There are three guards around the corner, coming towards you. You'd
rather not stick your head out to look more closely.
161888: Their footfalls are quiet and steady.
161912: You catch soft murmuring, some laughing remark about the mysterious
lab.
161960: You catch soft murmuring, some wry remark about boredom.
162000: You catch soft murmuring, some remark about uniforms.
162052: Whoever is making the noise is not visible.
162078: The footsteps move out of a branch corridor to the north -- a trio of
guards, still heading this way. You dodge back out of their line of view,
flattening yourself inside the west side of the tee.
162190: You duck back into the northwest hall as the guards come around the
corner. A quick glance reveals that they are heading west now, towards you.
162276: The guards come around the corner. Well-trained guards, of course, look
both ways when they enter an intersection. For a moment you stare at them
staring at you. Then they draw their weapons.
162390: The guards come around the corner. One glances south, and begins to
wave to the woman at the end of the hall. The other two do not, and find
themselves looking right at you. They hesitate only for the barest fraction of
a second.
162600: The footsteps seem to be approaching.
162624: The guards have nearly reached the corner that conceals you.
162656: You hear the guards coming closer.
162676: Three guards are at the end of the hall, to the east. They are
inspecting something on the ground -- two are kneeling, the third standing over
them. Their backs are towards you at the moment.
162780: They are speaking too softly for you to hear.
162832: One of the guards pulls out a comm and begins speaking into it.
162872: One of the guards stands up; in the movement she turns, and sees you.
Without pausing she draws her gun and shouts for you to freeze.
162956: There are three guards around the corner, hurrying towards you -- or
rather towards the door that just opened in front of them.
163026: The guards charge into the junction, looking in every direction at
once.
163068: You dodge for the northwest corridor, but not fast enough; shouts rise
behind you, and the guards give chase.
163192: You are poised against the wall, just inside the western hallway, out
of sight of the guards to the north.
163252: You can see that the east hall reaches a dead end a short distance
away.
163292: Three guards stand in the dead end, their backs to you.
163324: If you cross the north hallway in front of the guards, they'll
certainly see you.
163372: You leap across the intersection, into the dead end. Behind you, the
guards begin to shout.
163424: You leap across the intersection, into the dead end. Behind you, the
guards begin to shout.
163476: You stroll down the dead end to where the guards are. They turn, look
you up and down, and all simultaneously pile on top of you.
163548: As you step into the intersection, three guards walk out of the
northeast branch. For a moment they stare at you staring at them. Then they
draw their weapons.
163644: You consider the possible results of walking right up to three armed
guards.
163688: You step out into the intersection and casually walk up to the guards.
They casually draw their pulse guns and point them at you.
163790: You step out into the intersection, into the guards' faces. They
converge and roll over you without any hesitation at all.
163866: You hold your breath and slip around the corner, out of the guards'
line of sight. And pause... and there is no cry of alarm. You exhale --
silently -- and stroll off to the north.
163980: You dash down the west corridor, as quickly as you can.
164012: You begin edging down the west corridor, away from the guards. But
quiet as you are, you're no more than halfway to the next junction when one of
them turns around.
164104: You move down the west corridor; but as you approach the junction, you
hear voices. The corridor where you were captured sounds like it's still being
searched. You don't dare even look; you slide back to the tee intersection, as
quietly as you can.
164248: Hallways lead west, east, and north.
164272: From here, you can only see a short hallway which ends by a metal door.
164316: The dead end is shadowed and dark.
164360: clatters down the hall into the dead end. The guards whirl around, of
course, and see you instantly.
164416: clatters down the hall into the dead end. The guards, intent on the
open door, do not seem to notice.
164520: "Did you hear that?" comes a voice from the north. "Sounded like it was
coming from the wiring closet," another guard says, a frown in his tone.

The
footsteps begin to hurry. The three guards round the corner, and run down the
east hall -- without a glance at where you huddle in the western branch.
164740: The door to the south is metal. As usual, it has a black sensor plate
beside it.
164788: You hurl yourself towards the open door, snatching at the lockpick as
you go by. Nearly -- but your fingers close wrong, and the silver rod clatters
to the floor behind you as you dive over the threshold. The door slides closed;
you are left in quiet dark.
164934: A moment later, the door slides open again. A surprising number of
pulse guns are aimed through it, all at you.
165004: The door snaps open. You have a brief glimpse of frightened-looking
technicians, surrounded by obscure equipment, before someone hits an override
and the door snaps shut again.

Someone must have hit an alarm, as well,
because a sharp buzzer sounds.
165188: snaps open -- and closed again. Someone must have hit an
override.

Someone must have hit an alarm, as well, because a sharp buzzer
sounds.
165278: A sharp buzzer sounds somewhere.
165304: The metal door hisses open. The guards to the east spin, at the noise.
They stare at the door and at you.
165362: The metal door slides open. To the north, the footfalls of the guards
cease, startled by this apparition. Then they begin again -- hurrying.
165450: The footsteps suddenly freeze. Then they begin again -- hurrying.
165500: If you move within reach of the door, you'll be in full view of the
guards.
165572: If you move within reach of the plate, you'll be in full view of the
guards.
165616: This bare stretch of hallway angles from the northwest to the east;
another short hall leads south.
165676: You move back to the junction, but duck hastily as you glimpse movement
up the north corridor. Three guards, heading towards you -- fortunately they
didn't seem to see you. You flatten yourself inside the west side of the tee,
out of their line of view.
165820: You consider the possible results of walking right up to three armed
guards.
165864: You step out into the intersection and calmly walk up to the guards.
They calmly draw their pulse guns and point them at you.
165964: You return up the corridor, across the red line.
165992: You take half a step and nearly trip as you turn. A woman is standing
to the south, at the end of the hall. She leans on the frame of an open door,
talking to someone in the room beyond. If you continue, she will certainly
notice you.
166124: You move south, light on your feet as you can be. But luck isn't up to
hope. Before you are halfway down the hall, the woman catches your movement
from the corner of her eye. She glances over, and then frowns, and then shouts
and ducks inside the door. A buzzer sounds loudly.
166292: Hallways run northwest, east, and south.
166320: To the south, at the end of the hall, a woman is leaning on the frame
of an open door. She is facing into the door, talking with someone inside; she
has not noticed you.
166412: You can't quite hear over the distance and the hiss of ventilation.
From the few words you can catch, she's arguing over how to structure the
translation database, or something of that sort. It means nothing to you.
166534: clatters down the hall towards the woman. She looks down at it; then up
the hall, as you dodge back behind the corner. You hold yourself
motionless...

And a moment later, a guard comes around the corner, pulse gun
drawn.
166670: She glances up the hall at the sound of your voice. She frowns
slightly, and then shouts, and ducks inside the door. A buzzer sounds loudly.
166798: You catch a movement to the south. At the end of the hall, a woman is
leaning on the frame of an open door. She is facing into the door, talking with
someone inside; she has not noticed you.
166908: The woman shakes her head again, and you barely duck behind the
junction corner as she glances around.
166972: The corridor ends here, blank, with a single steel door on the north
wall. The door is
167020: You move back to the junction, but backpedal hastily as you glimpse
movement up the north corridor. Three guards, heading towards you --
fortunately they didn't seem to see you. You drift back into the cover of the
east hallway.
167152: You leap across the intersection into the west corridor. But there
really was no hope that the guards would overlook you. Behind you, they begin
shouting.
167244: The hallway only returns to the west.
167268: The door to the north is metal. As usual, it has a black sensor plate
beside it.
167316: You slide hastily through the closing door. This time, you are careful
to keep a firm grip on your lockpick.
167402: You see the door to the east, in the dead end, slide open.
167464: The door to the east closes completely.
167486: The door begins to slide shut as soon as the pick loses its link.
167528: The metal door to the north isn't important.
167552: The door opens, only it's ajar. Ha! Ha! Ha! [BUG]
167584: "Very neat. Behind the backs of the guards, and leave them to mumble
over the lockpick -- not that they knew what it was at the time, of course. And
you slip north into the core areas."
167696: "There's only one place here you're truly interested in."
167734: "I assume you went straight to the lab, then?"
167792: "I assumed Security was later, because the lab is your primary
objective. Was, to say." His voice slows, again contemplative, unsettling to
you. "Your story is
167910: The man watches you carefully, as though you would ever give anything
away. "I will assume that you went straight to the lab, and Security not until
later."
168008: "That makes no sense. We both know your goal.
168040: "Certainly you did. We both know your goal.
168072: "There is tension, but the flow is clear. The hero will extract the
secret plans and escape; I wouldn't believe you if you said anything else.
Except, of course, you didn't escape."

He is still seated, but his eyes are
the eyes of a man pacing. "This isn't a story.
168238: "There is tension, but the flow is clear. The hero will extract the
secret plans and escape; I wouldn't believe you if you said anything else.
Except, of course, you didn't escape."

He is still seated, but his eyes are
the eyes of a man pacing. "This isn't a story.
168406: He muses, "There is tension, but the flow is clear. The hero will
extract the secret plans and escape; I wouldn't believe you if you said
anything else. Except, of course, you didn't escape."

He is still seated, but
his eyes are the eyes of a man pacing. "This isn't a story.
168592: Do you realize what this technology will be used for?" He seems as
astonished at the outburst as you.
168664: "Naturally. You were sent for, and so you came." That must be a quote.
"Implications are someone else's job.
168740: about it. A fine time to be starting...
168770: Clean War.' No troops, no civilian blood. One man at a time, slipped
into an office or a palace, beyond any hope of wall or guard. Or not even a man
-- a grenade, a canister of gas. The end," wryly -- "of security. I'd be out of
a job." His eyes are distant, and again you feel that you are the least
important thing in the room.

"Bad enough if we get it first. We'll take you
apart, or just threaten to. Harsh but quick. It would be over, we'd have won.
But if your people get it too, if you'd gotten out with the data, do you
realize...?"
169124: "Yes, you said. And you don't --" He stops. "
169188: "Of course you don't. You just march. But see...
169264: He is very still, watching you think. "
169288: Knives at each other's throats. How long could
169324: last? Two years, five. Eventually it would be too tempting, some
premier or on-commander who poses too much immediate threat." Somehow his eyes
are holding yours. "Then it
169444: be literal knives at each other's literal cursed throats. Whole
governments beheaded overnight. Same for anyone who tries to move up, take
charge. It wouldn't end. Could you swear, honestly, that anyone left on your
side wouldn't keep using it on anyone left on our side? Senate-men? Troops?
Farmers?"
169648: The man seems to -- not sag, but sink down from somewhere briefly
above. "If you think that, there's nothing I can say to you. Let's continue.
The lab."
169738: There is a long pause; and then the man smiles... not at you. "And in
spite of that, or anything -- I march too. Let's get back to that. The lab."
169832: "Well, truly, think on that. If you can." The man seems to put
something aside. "Let's continue. The lab."
169900: There is regret in the man's eyes. "Lies again -- in such a small
thing? I thought we knew each other better than that, in this room."
169984: The man sighs. "No. No guards. Save your
170036: "This is not a victory for you, you must see. You know I am not a fool
170156: . The guards did not see you, not yet. Can we continue without more
such obstacles?"
170208: "Enough! You are making this intolerable. You will continue without
being seen, and without other fabrication, do you understand?"
170284: "Then I will not repeat the obvious."
170306: The emotion drops behind a visible wall, and his eyes are as you first
saw them. "No matter. The guards did not see you in that corridor, either.
Please refrain from having them do so."
170416: His head comes up sharply. "Then I will not waste further time." He
touches a sequence of controls.
170480: He nods slowly. "We do, and I see it unsettles you. And so you try to
push me away with an obvious lie." A frown. "I know you have never feared me;
but you need not fear yourself, either. Anything you learn about me will also
be the truth. You may still want to lie to me -- about meeting those guards,
thus -- but I don't need to lie to you."
170694: His jaw tightens. "This is not a game you I will let you play much
longer. But there is more I need."
170762: "The guards from Station Two did not know you were there. None of the
guards did, not until the end."
170826: understand, do you not? The guards from Station Two did not see you.
Not once! Now, again."
170884: . I might think you would weary of that scene
170940: . It's a small matter but I can't let it slip."
170970: "The happy ending, of course. You blow the lock and walk inside, and
the plans are free to your hand." The man pauses. "Indeed, I wonder why you
didn't do that, when you were actually there. I don't doubt your gel tab was
powerful enough to do what you claim. It wasn't that -- you didn't simply fail
to think of it, did you?" The man half-laughs in surprise.
171196: So fixated on your lockpick to open your way, that you didn't think to
use force. Until I gave you another chance." He is laughing, now, softly.
171288: "I should have known. I wonder that your people sent you at all; they
must have had sharper tools. Well. Your loss; our... victory."
171376: "I know what that is like; everyone must, I suppose. You took advantage
of enough lapses in
171438: attention, to get as far as you did. We shall call it even."
171480: "You must feel embarrassed. No matter. It did not happen, and there's
an end of it."
171540: "Then why didn't you?" He considers. "I suppose you were told not to
leave footprints. But surely the lab had priority? The information, getting it
out, had to be more important than whether we knew you'd been there."
171672: "Then..." He is staring past you. "You would have blasted the door if
you could have... so you didn't have the tab anymore--" His fingers are moving
before his words are finished. "You've been--"
171794: The man is shaking his head. "I hope, one day, to have one of your
superiors in that chair. I would truly like to understand how they set their
priorities."
171892: important?" The man is shaking his head. "I hope, one day, to have one
of your superiors in that chair. I would truly like to understand how they set
their priorities."
171992: "As I said -- an obvious move, and it would have worked. But there is
no hole in our door."
172050: "Worth the attempt. But our doors were all replaced last year; the
power of your chemical agents is no secret to our... chemical agents." His face
is still deadly serious, but an eyebrow quirks for a moment. "Even the common
doors cannot be penetrated by your catalytic acid
172228: . The lab door, of course, is more carefully protected than that."
172312: I have already said: our forensics people found no sign that the stuff
has been used within the building.
172376: Our forensic chemists have checked the building; there is no sign that
the stuff has been used on the lab door, or anywhere else.
172450: "Do we need to keep dwelling on that acid?"
172482: The corridor from the east ends here, and a single door looms to the
west. It's no larger than the doors you've seen elsewhere; but it somehow
looks... heavy. Unyielding. Reinforcing struts cross the door's face, and the
surface is sheathed with some black coating.
172638: The end of the hallway is still well-lit.
172664: You follow the corridor's curve to the southeast.
172696: The corridor runs only southeast from here, and the lab door is west.
172734: The door is no larger than the doors you've seen elsewhere; but it
somehow looks... heavy. Unyielding. Reinforcing struts cross the door's face,
and the surface is sheathed with some black coating. However, the black plate
beside the door is quite standard.
172890: You duck through the closing door, keeping the lockpick firmly in hand.
172958: There is a clank somewhere, but the door does not move.
173000: somewhere. A moment later, the door swings towards you. The scent of
ozone brushes through the doorway.
173060: The door is reinforced with thick square bars, which run down and along
its entire front. The struts are coated with the same black material as the
rest of the door.
173176: The bars are as rigid as the steel they certainly are.
173208: You could easily climb the bars, but it would gain you little. There is
nothing above within reach of the door.
173272: on top of one of the struts. It remains there, leaning against the
surface of the door.
173344: The door and its struts are coated with some dead-black material. You
do not recognize it.
173396: The black surface gives very slightly to your touch -- soft, but thin,
over steel.
173448: The black coating does not slide over the structure beneath.
173484: You cannot mark the black coating.
173504: The black coating is fixed in place.
173524: The corridor heads east from here, but quickly curves out of sight to
the southeast.
173576: The white corridor runs south and east from here, with a wide branch
curving northwest towards the laboratory.
173642: You jerk back from the intersection, a reflexive startled leap; there
are six guards down the hall to the south. They do not seem to have seen you.
173724: You are standing just inside the northwest branch, out of sight of the
guards to the south.
173774: You can see brighter light shining around the curve to the northwest.
173818: The hallway curves west until it reaches the black door.
173852: You duck across the intersection. The guards to the south, distracted
by their own business, do not notice you; so you continue unchallenged to the
east.
173940: You leap across the intersection. To the south, the guards begin to
shout.
173982: You step out into the intersection, and begin walking towards the
guards. They in turn begin running towards you -- weapons drawn.
174064: You peer carefully around the corner. The corridor to the south ends at
a door, and angles sharply to the northwest from there. The guards are
clustered around the door.
174156: One is holding some instrument to his ear, occasionally speaking to it.
But the other five are still watching the hallways; you quickly pull back out
of their view.
174252: They are looking at each other, gesturing quickly.
174284: You catch three of the guards disappearing around the corner, northwest
from the others. The other three watch them go.
174352: You see three of the guards moving towards you. You quickly pull back
out of their view.
174404: There are now only three of them, but they are watching both the north
and northwest corridors with added vigilance. You quickly pull back out of
their view.
174496: Three of the guards are coming up the corridor. You quickly pull back,
but they are too close for quickness; they have seen you.
174588: The six are arranging themselves to watch both north and northwest,
three and three. You quickly pull back out of their view.
174664: They are watching both north and northwest, three and three, and you
quickly pull back out of their view.
174728: One of the guards is talking quietly. The words, of course, are drowned
out by the ever-present ventilation.
174796: You hear footsteps receding slowly.
174820: You hear footsteps approaching slowly.
174844: You hear footsteps to the south, very near.
174870: clatters down the hall towards the guards. You duck back behind the
corridor's corner as footsteps approach. When the guards do see you, they are
not pleased.
174966: You hear voices among the guards to the south.
174996: One of the guards says "Yes, with'."
175022: You hear footsteps from the south -- moving away from you, fortunately.
175066: To the south, you hear a door slide open, then closed.
175098: You hear voices among the guards to the south.
175128: One of the guards says "Yes, with'."
175154: You hear footsteps from the south -- moving towards you.
175190: Footsteps to the south are getting closer.
175218: Three guards come around the corner. You are left in plain view,
flattened against the wall, smiling at them apologetically.
175296: To the south, you hear a door slide open, then closed.
175372: The door opens, only it's ajar. Ha! Ha! Ha! [BUG]
175404: You could have used the blast tab, did you realize? It would have
punched through the door, I'm sure. You would have been in and out.
175480: And you didn't use the blast tab. Just walked away.
175516: By that much you missed starting a war. Or ending the one we've
got."

The man stops, gives you a measured glance. "This is a war, for all that
we're not shooting."
175620: think more like me than my own by-commander does. I think: if this is
peace, why are the armies getting larger?
175684: But if this is peace, why are the armies getting larger?
175760: And even more money on secrets than on simple guns."
175794: A one-sided smile. "I'll make a note of that, for our estimates of your
budget schedules."

He passes that off with a tense wave.
175878: After a moment, he grants you an open palm, and a flash of a smile.
"Ever on guard -- even with your side's budget schedules."

He passes that off
with a tense wave.
175984: You've thought about this technology.
176012: You say you haven't thought about this technology.
176044: It could put our footprints on the moons. We could walk to other stars
as easily as to the bathhouse. Oceans and mountains wouldn't be walls..." Again
he is watching you intently.

"That, I think, is what our masters are afraid
of. They'll face death before living without walls. You, is that why you're
here? Why you're willing to unchain a war of assassination?"
176320: " He takes a breath, and calms.

"You left the lab without using your
explosive. You came back to Security. To get your precious lockpick, for the
lab door?" The silver rod flashes between his fingers; you had forgotten he was
holding it.
176474: "But for other reasons as well, I think. Show me."
176510: "Perhaps other reasons as well, but I think the pick must have been
first in your mind. Show me."
176570: "Perhaps other reasons as well, but I think the pick must have been
first in your mind. Show me."
176788: You haven't impressed me thus far, but I don't truly think you're
incompetent.
176840: And you've demonstrated that you're not an amateur.
176874: "You didn't set off the alarm going in, and you weren't found inside,
so you must have suppressed the scan-web coming out as well. Yes?" He does not
wait for a reply.
176982: He looks irritable. "No, no scan-web alarms. Not then, not at all."
177032: "Yes, the wonderful scan-scrambler. But
177064: it cannot be miraculous. The high-sensitivity webs around Security
could be fooled; but the scrambler's presence would leave eddies. Glitches, you
understand. More than a few of those in a handful of seconds, and the watchdogs
get suspicious. As you showed me -- the alarms would ring." He raises an
eyebrow. "
177264: Please, again, and using the magic less clumsily.
177296: In fact, you couldn't have made it up the corridor with the scrambler
active. Let's just take it as read that it wasn't.
177372: "We went back, you must know, and looked at every stray spark in the
scan-data. We know how you used the scrambler. On and off, briefly enough to
never upset our systems. And it did
177494: "Mm," the man says slowly. "This grows complex.
177532: your scrambler leaves traces -- submerged in the scan noise if you use
it briefly, as you have been doing, but traces nonetheless. We have since
analyzed every sequence of the scan-web data. The results are quite precise;
you used the scrambler four times. Four blips, on and off, you understand.
177740: Besides, I doubt you would have used the device unnecessarily. Standing
around flipping it on and off, or dashing through a room for a cursory glance,
would not be worth the risk to you.
177848: "

He shrugs. "We can play guessing-games all afternoon; but matters
would go faster if you stuck to the facts."
177992: And I do not think you wasted any of those uses.
178024: "Ah. We know that you used your scrambler four times.
178060: But that hardly aids your cause if you merely stood in the hallway
while doing it.
178136: in that process. And you do not seem to be the sort who wastes
resources.
178180: "I'm afraid we would have picked up the glitches from extensive
scrambler use, even down the hall from the Security web."
178250: "And away you went." The man hesitates, and continues. "That was
unnerving, you in this room.
178316: And when you sat down, the... shadows... I've not seen that before.
178364: If I hadn't gotten the resonance damped, matters might have been very
bad." He does not say for whom, you notice. "
178440: Was that a true memory? The readings were odd, but that might have been
the emotional loading of the chair, the controls -- were you truly in here?"
178526: But why?" The man frowns, distant. "Nothing in here you could want; the
lockpick was in storage, and my office must have been--" His gaze falls again
on you, locked in your chair. "There's nothing in here but... unless you..." He
is scowling now, and he stares at you.

And then he leaps to his feet, looks
more closely. "You
178746: ...!" For an instant he seems about to move towards you, and then he
seizes himself, and hurls himself back on his controls. Fingers flying in
sequence, and he pays you no attention at all.
178866: "Mmm." He examines his controls again. "I shall assume that's the
truth. Interesting. Well, we must try again, then."
178980: He examines his controls again. "Well, I'll assume the readings were
transient. We should try it again."
179054: "The same strange readings, I'm afraid. I don't believe you came in
this room at all. This is, after all, the one memory you could certainly fake;
you're here
179168: But the stresses give you away." He considers for a moment, nods
absently, and reaches for his controls.
179324: "Ah? There's one guard who can testify otherwise -- or will be able to
soon, I should say."
179380: "That's better. One of my people is still recovering from its effect."
179424: The man turns the pen reflectively. "Well, and I hope not. There's one
guard who can testify otherwise -- or will be able to soon, I should say."
179620: . It's a small matter but I can't let it slip."
179650: "You certainly know better to play with controls that you could only
mishandle. And
179752: "And there we found you, lying helpless, several hours later." He
shakes his head. "Not a very exciting ending to your tale. I found the truth of
it much more dramatic."
179864: "You disagree? Well, perhaps anticlimatic from your perspective.
Certainly an escape would have been much more satisfying. But anything has to
be better than a paralyzed coma."
179974: "Ah, not responsive even as an art critic? Ah well."
180014: "Now, you know you kept that clever device, and used it much more
effectively than that."
180072: "Impressive, but hardly realistic. I just came from my office, and it's
quite as tidy as it should be."
180142: "Nicely put," he nods, "but not exactly factual." He nods towards the
door, across the hall, although neither of you can see directly. "No damage
visible."
180244: "You may wish, of course." The man smiles appreciatively. "But the
walls are sound, the chair is whole, and you are in it. Your tale cannot change
that." He reaches for his controls.
180360: This is the end of a short hallway, which runs southwest back to the
main corridor. Three large doorways open to the north, east, and south.
180470: Before you can move, a buzzer begins sounding up and down the halls.
Moments later, you hear guards running in your direction.
180544: As you enter the room, a buzzer sounds briefly once.
180578: As you step into the room, a buzzer begins to sound.
180612: You can barely see a band of scan-web over the doorway, just inside the
room.
180668: The white hallway waits outside. You can see a band of scan-web running
above the doorway.
180722: You step gingerly under the scan-web band. Silence. You recall, with
some relief, that the man failed to turn it back on after the guard left.
180812: You roll past the man's reach and dive towards the door. Over your
shoulder you see him start after you, and then swerve and reach for his
desk.

A buzzer sounds sharply as you dash into the hall.
180928: As you leave the room, a buzzer sounds briefly once.
180962: As you leave the room, a buzzer begins to sound.
181004: The hall just runs southwest to the intersection.
181036: The room to the east is unexpectedly luxurious, with a dark wooden desk
and rich panelling. It seems to be occupied mostly by cabinets.
181124: The room to the north is walled in bare metal.
181152: A squat metal chair and a control-covered console face each other;
there is nothing beside.
181212: A control-covered console faces the spot where your chair squatted.
181260: The room to the south is filled with lockers; there is a table at the
far end.
181308: Just inside each of the three doorways, on the ceilings of the three
rooms, you see a glittering band of scan-web. The web's narrow spacing
indicates a tight scan -- capable of picking up resonance signals off even a
naked human body.
181452: The corridor runs north and south, like every other hallway in this
place. A short hallway branches off to the northeast. To the west is a blank
metal door, with attendant black plate beside it.
181568: You can see brighter lights shining in the security annex to the
northeast; there is a murmur of voices as well.
181636: The door snaps open, and you find yourself staring at an armed guard.
He seems to recognize you; at least, he loses no time into bringing up his
pulse gun.
181752: , snaps open. A startled-looking guard leans out. He's not startled
enough to hesitate before he begins firing at you.
181828: The ceiling is a solid sheet of acoustical insulation. Light comes from
glowing discs, deeply inset behind wire grilles. A band of scan-web runs along
the ceiling in front of the doorway.
181940: You bend and leap, and your head thumps solidly into the ceiling.
181976: You bend and leap. Your fingers brush the ceiling, but not strongly
enough to do anything.
182028: The ceiling is a foot out of your reach.
182052: The ceiling is a foot out of your reach.
182076: The ceiling insulation is layered over something unyielding.
182112: The ceiling is rough and slightly soft.
182136: The ceiling absorbs your blow in silence.
182164: A band of scan-web runs along the ceiling in front of the doorway. The
web's narrow spacing indicates a tight scan, capable of picking up resonance
signals off even a naked human body.
182280: The scan-web only covers the area just inside the door. You can't reach
it from the desk.
182328: The ceiling is a foot out of your reach.
182352: The room is illuminated by discs of glowing plastic, recessed in the
ceiling and covered by wire grilles.
182416: The glowing discs are shielded behind wire grilles.
182448: Heavy wire meshes protect the lights.
182472: Dark wood panelling surrounds you, a refuge from the harsh white
visible to the west. A massive mahogany desk sits in one corner. The rest of
the room is mostly metal cabinets, but
182576: Some rich wood, in pleasingly irregular spans, polished but naturally
dark.
182628: Your fingers glide over the wood.
182648: You pound the wood. The sound is muffled almost to silence; insulation
must lie under the beautiful grain.
182712: A heavy silence lies behind the wood -- high quality soundproofing, at
least.
182764: No span of the panelling seems likely to move.
182788: You can't see any unusual cracks or spaces in the panelling. But then,
it would be unusual if you could.
182852: The faint herbal flavor of some polishing compound drifts from the
wood.
182892: Three-drawer metal cabinets stand in rows along each wall. The drawers
are the normal size for file folders; there is a tiny black plate on the front
of each one.
182992: You pull on a few of the handles, but all the drawers seem to be
locked.
183032: All the drawers are already closed.
183052: The cabinets are too heavy to move.
183084: Each cabinet drawer has a tiny, rectangular black plate embedded in its
front.
183136: The plates are fixed in the drawers.
183156: The desk is an imposing mass, plain of line but precisely crafted.
183216: You peer hopefully under the desk, but even there the floor is
relentlessly tidy.
183264: The bookcase is hand-carved, hung with wooden ivy vines and tiny
berries. Volumes of technology journals fill some shelves; but others display
antique folios, leather-bound collections of plays, and a small array of
dawn-tales and fireside stories.
183420: You find nothing but books on the shelves.
183444: You feel intricately carved wood.
183468: The bookcase is too heavy to move.
183488: You see the complete works of Gahtmahan, "Nightclumps and
Wind-Whispers," a volume of Connaeus woodcuts... if you had time, the shelves
would be worth a closer look. You don't.
183600: The books are unlikely to help with what you need to do.
183636: No, none of the books is a trigger for a secret door. You're just a
little disappointed.
183692: (I hope you weren't expecting some kind of "Rito and Imita" in-joke.)
183750: The drawing has been removed from the wall, revealing a magnetic
mounting pad on the back.
183804: The sketch reads, "This space intentionally left Zarf." [BUG]
183868: Grey waves beat below an indeterminate, cloudy sky. Nearly lost in the
distance is a raft -- a tiny shape bearing away beneath a wind-torn white sail.
183964: The sketch is in soft talc-pencil, but nonetheless the stars shine out,
hard distant facets in a jewel-black expanse. One moon is high and one is
rising; they too are in bright focus, every crater and mare. The cool burning
moons'-light tints the sky silver from behind.
184132: A young man looks out from precise ink stippling. His expression is
serious, and dark eyes meet yours with near-visible force.
184212: You have never seen his face before.
184236: You recognize his face now; you have seen it, older but no less
serious, across his desk this long day. His eyes have not changed at all.
184320: A magnetic pad is visible on the back of the sketch. It's nothing
unusual; it just keeps the thing on the wall where it belongs.
184396: You are in a dim room, bounded by metal walls.
184488: facing it is an instrument-covered desk. Otherwise the room is sterile.
The bright hallway waits to the south.
184556: You feel a chill of memory in your bones.
184584: The walls are naked metal, unadorned. They give your eyes nowhere to
rest.
184632: The desk is a standard modular composite design. The surface is
panelled with ranks of controls and instruments.
184700: You can't climb on the desk without slamming into dozens of controls
that you have no idea what they do.
184756: You can't reach the desk from the chair.
184776: The desk is covered with dials, readouts, screen panels, sliders, and
dozens of other instruments. You can put no form nor name to any of them.
184864: You can't see the desk clearly from the chair.
184888: There are a few labels scattered among the controls, and they seem to
have a biological bent: "Neurotrans.", "Hippocamp.", "EKG", "Amygdala". But the
whole leaves you as uncertain as the parts.
185016: You feel another distant chill.
185036: You can't reach the desk from the chair.
185056: The controls are dark now, and inert.
185078: You flip a few controls around. The displays change in arbitrary ways
-- involving an increasing amount of red.
185152: It's just a blank, acid-scarred disk of metal. The voice module seems
to be embedded in the surface.
185212: The pedestal under the chair isn't important.
185240: The chair is ugly. Steel slats are riveted to a heavy metal frame, and
the whole rests on a steel column rising from a pedestal on the floor.
Restraints are welded to the arm and foot rests; wires hang limply from the
head support.
185396: You jerk out of the chair, stumbling as you pull against restraints
that are not there.
185446: The half-visible figure is gone.
185472: The chair does not move on its base.
185496: You sit down in the chair. It is not comfortable.
185524: You feel another distant chill.
185544: There is a half-remembered cool pressure around your wrists, your
ankles, your forehead.
185600: For a moment, someone is visible, facing you across the desk.
185640: The human outline bends over the desk, then regards you again. A sense
of wordless sound moves across you.
185750: The chill is gone. You are alone in the room.
185784: You stare at the metal bands, until you are certain they are not
fastened around your limbs.
185840: The heft of the bands leaves nothing to chance.
185868: The metal restraints are much stronger than you.
185896: Leads hang from the headrest. There is a sensor contact on the end of
each one.
185942: The figure is nearly not there -- like shadows at the edge of your
sight, or a dream of blindness. It crawls away from your vision; your eyes feel
thick and strained.
186048: You can almost hear words, but they too drift on the edge of
understanding.
186088: Your words do not reach the figure.
186108: You cannot move to reach the figure.
186128: Your words do not reach the figure.
186148: Your words do not reach the figure.
186168: This narrow room is lined with steel lockers. There is a plain table at
the south end, and the doorway to the north exits to the corridor.
186248: The locker doors vary in size, from palm-length cubbies to a closet
apparently large enough to walk into.
186312: All the doors are closed. Each locker has a four-digit number on it.
186380: All the lockers are already closed.
186400: You thump a locker door. It sounds quite sturdy.
186432: You look at a random locker. The number
186456: The numbers are printed on the locker doors.
186480: It's just a plastic worktable, a slab built onto the south wall.
186520: The table doesn't look strong enough to support your weight.
186560: The table is a slab extending from the south wall. It can't be moved.
186600: . The nib looks a bit sharp, though
186644: With its nib broken, the pen isn't going to write much.
186684: The pen's nib isn't a normal ball tip. It seems to be a sliver of some
indigo crystal -- a needle-sharp sliver.
186780: You can't do that if you're not holding the pen.
186808: The pen isn't flexible, you understand.
186860: You press your fingernail against the sliver of crystal, which snaps
away instantly and is lost.
186918: The indigo needle slices through your skin as if through water. The
prick is trivial; but then icy cold races up your nerves, followed by numbness,
and the world folds away into chill dark.
187034: The sliver of crystal dissolves instantly on your tongue, without
flavor. Then a wash of icy numbness runs down your throat, and up over your
eyes, and the world folds away into chill dark.
187152: There is a small dark stain of blood on the pen's tip.
187184: You scrub at the stain until it's gone.
187250: The harsh buzz continues. Within moments you also hear footsteps
hurrying towards you.
187308: The harsh buzz continues. Within moments you also hear footsteps
hurrying towards you.
187364: A buzzer begins sounding up and down the halls. Moments later, you hear
guards running in your direction.
187426: A moment after you step into the room, the scrambler emits a sharp
squeal. Then a sharper crackling noise -- and then a thread of smoke, as its
quiet vibration ceases.
187584: The door opens, only it's ajar. Ha! Ha! Ha! [BUG]
187616: He considers. "You were searching the storage room for your lockpick,
of course. I'm afraid I had it at the time. ...Although whoever left the pen
lying out is due a reprimand. Sloppy, and you provided an excellent
demonstration of why." His smile is, for the first time, self-satisfied. It's
more frightening even than you expected -- but quickly gone.
187872: Obviously not to duck in for a single breath of air, as you just showed
me. What, then?
187928: I'm sure it wasn't my artwork -- that's still there, and petty
vandalism is beneath you in any case. What, then?
188000: Passcodes, keys, open drawers and indiscretions?"
188034: "I'm not at all sorry to have disappointed you. I am good at my job,
and I am careful, which is the same thought. If you could have caught me loose,
caught me blind or far-eyed, you might have succeeded. You did not." And there
is a brief silence.
188192: "What, then, my books of dawn-tales? I wonder if I understand you at
all." His gaze rests on yours, deceptively light. After a moment he continues
as lightly.
188528: . You have striven to keep this session calm, and I do not think it was
out of fear of my anger
188584: . Your eyes never, never waver from mine."
188612: He leans back in his own chair, bearing your gaze. "I have tried to
treat you as an equal, a companion in our work. That is technique, of course;
we both know that. But it is also sincere
188736: . And I think you have taken it in that faith. We
188772: faces reflected in the mirror of our countries' border. I think you
understand that." He nods.
188968: . You may not be brilliant -- you make mistakes -- but you are
determined. You hold that strength to what you believe
189040: know you are intelligent, as well as determined. You hold those
strengths to what you believe
189120: , even if what you believe seems -- well. As I said
189156: ."

He shrugs, and offers a smile as honest as you have seen. "Well?
Have I done well? It is my job to know everything about you, after all."
189248: reaches again for his controls. "But we are nearly done. You have only
a few more seconds; and you have yet to show me what becomes of your mysterious
cloth-wrapped package."
189354: He bows in place, both palms open. "I am delighted."

And then he
189398: "No? Or is this merely the final lie?" He smiles again, to show he is
joking.

And then he
189460: "One last bout of silence?" He shrugs, and
189490: "Cutting matters a bit short, aren't we? There's someone you forgot to
meet. And we did not capture you with your tools -- much less that fascinating
package."
189592: "The guard shot you? And then shot himself, one must suppose. No. He
has not yet regained his wits, but I think when he does, he will tell a
different story."
189696: "Well done." The man is applauding softly. "A heroic end to your
shining tale; and in the large, an accurate one. But not precise.
189816: The guard, for a beginning, was left in considerably worse shape than
you have admitted. But that is of less concern.
189884: You fell into our hands without those fascinating tools you have been
showing off all this time. And without the package, you understand, the one you
found in
189978: corridor ceiling. I am very curious to know what you did with those
things."
190160: . We have found no sign of those fascinating tools, or of that package.
I am very curious to know what you did with them."
190234: "Everyone was watching. You didn't have your precious acid. You didn't
have anything when you were captured; you still haven't told me where you put
it all. I still want to know."
190344: "No. You didn't have your clever little explosive. You didn't have
anything when you were captured; you still haven't told me where you put it
all. I still want to know."
190446: "Enough. No magic tricks, no bursts of acid, no explosions; just the
truth."
190502: "Believe me, we would have been delighted to find you lying unconscious
in the hallway. We were not so lucky."
190572: Footsteps are approaching.
190612: at the guards. Shouts chase you back. You have a bare second before the
guards fall into the intersection -- from both the east and northwest --
dropping to the ground, guns out and braced.
190724: You throw yourself to a halt, nearly stumbling, as you hear footsteps
approaching from the northwest... and then the guards behind you become audible
as well. You duck around the southern corner and glance about desperately.
190858: The guards to the east are drawing closer.
190882: The guards to the northwest are drawing closer.
190908: A group of guards comes around the corner from the east. One begins to
salute lazily up the northwest corridor; then they spot you, all at once, and
all at once they hurl themselves at you. You are pinned before you can begin to
retreat.
191048: Footsteps are approaching.
191068: The guards are off to the northwest.
191088: Several guards are arrayed in the intersection -- crouched, sheltered
by the corners, or prone on the floor. They all seem intent on taking you down.
191172: The guards are well-trained to shoot first, talk later. That's the
beauty of pulse guns.
191228: up the corridor. It clatters into the intersection, and you hear
startled words from the guards around the corner.
191292: up the corridor. It clatters among the guards, and they shift
reflexively to let it pass.
191384: , aiming blindly up the corridor -- precision doesn't matter now. And
then the crackle of pulse charges begins to echo. You hear someone fall, good,
a mark; you are ducking behind the filing cabinet, you have no attention to
spare.
191522: Sparks shower off the cabinet. You lean around and snap off more shots;
clean misses. Pulses flash by you. You peer into the hail, and aim -- two down,
three --
191630: There is a weightless impact of darkness, and you are borne down in a
sparkling corona.
191684: The footsteps to the north are closer now.
191706: The guard glances swiftly that way, and then shouts hoarsely.
191746: The footsteps to the north are closer now.
191772: "Hold you!" comes a shout from the north. You take a quick glance;
several guards have come around the corner. Their narrow eyes take in
191876: The pulse-guns to the north begins crackling.
191904: The guard and you, still scuffling, are both unconscious within
moments.
191948: You dive for cover behind the cabinet, but a bolt slaps into you before
you are halfway there.
192044: This bare stretch of hallway angles from the northwest to the east;
another short hall leads south.
192104: You are backed into the southern branch.
192126: You leap around the corner and charge the guards. You almost get within
twenty feet before their pulse guns cut you down.
192198: You back down the corridor, as silently as you can.
192232: Hallways run northwest, east, and south.
192260: The hall runs a few yards to the south, and then dead-ends. There is a
closed door to one side.
192336: The door at the end of the south hall is closed.
192360: The door is at the end of the hallway, to the south.
192388: The hallway ends in a blank white wall. A metal door stands
192422: A large group of guards is visible to the north.
192454: You make a break up the hallway -- only to come into view of two groups
of guards, at once. Their pulse guns knock you sprawling before you can duck
back.
192546: You charge the guards and all their guns. It doesn't work.
192584: You can only return to the north, or face the western door.
192616: A discarded filing cabinet is standing by the wall.
192648: It's a standard three-drawer file cabinet.
192696: The cabinet is too heavy to lift.
192716: You give the cabinet a tentative push; it moves, with a metallic
screech which freezes you with alarm.
192780: You give the cabinet a tentative pull; it moves, with a metallic
screech which freezes you with alarm.
192844: The drawer won't come out any farther.
192868: You yank on the drawers; two are locked, but one comes open with an
internal clank. The drawer is empty.
192932: The door to the west is metal. It has no handle; another black plate is
visible beside it. The door is
193044: The guard is still standing in front of the doorway.
193096: A plastic grille is visible high on the wall, just below the ceiling.
It's hanging open
193172: . In the duct behind it, you can see
193192: You can't see into the grille from down here.
193216: The ventilation duct appears empty.
193240: The grille is barely a foot wide.
193260: Your position is precarious enough without that kind of juggling.
193300: You can't see anything in the ventilation duct.
193326: You lever the grille open with your fingers.
193354: The guard stands in the open doorway, staring wildly, but also reaching
for his gun.
193400: The guard is backpedalling, levelling his gun at you.
193432: The guard is sprawled unconscious on the floor.
193458: He is young, with short dark hair. His uniform is tightly creased and
perfectly clean. And the confusion is rapidly clearing from his eyes, as he
reaches for the pulse gun in his holster.
193580: He is young, with short dark hair. He lies sprawled on the floor,
unconscious, uniform mussed now.
193644: His gun has fallen on the floor nearby.
193672: You hurl yourself off the cabinet, pen clutched in your fist; your
weight drives it into the guard's shoulder.
193740: You feint, and then jab the pen into the guard's shoulder, as hard as
you can.
193784: His reflexive counter hurls you into the wall.

But then he shivers,
once, and slides to the ground, and remains there.
193860: Not while he's trying to shoot you.
193884: You pat the body down quickly, but nothing is immediately apparent. And
you don't have time for a more thorough search.
193956: Not likely, particularly when he's trying to shoot you.
193990: You hurl yourself off the cabinet, knocking the guard to the floor with
your full weight.
194042: You knock the guard's feet out from under him.
194074: You land a fierce blow, driving the guard into the wall.
194108: You lash at the guard; he staggers back.
194136: That would be redundant; he's not waking up soon.
194172: That would be redundant; he won't be waking up soon.
194208: Somewhere, a guard sings "O Sole Mio." [BUG]
194304: is that you can't tell us what's in that blood-cursed lab," he is
saying, back over his shoulder.

Then he sees you. He fumbles for his pulse
gun.
194400: The guard's gun is in his hand.
194420: The guard tracks you carefully, and squeezes the trigger. Blackness
slaps through you like a wave of cold iron.
194484: The guard pulls himself to his feet, and levels the gun again.
194522: The guard hurls himself backward, rolls to his feet, and brings up his
gun.
194572: The guard gathers himself and aims again.
194598: The guard squeezes his trigger convulsively. Blackness slaps through
you like a wave of cold iron.
194672: His gun lies near his limp hand.
194696: It's a standard pulse gun, a typically sharp-lined weapon. Quiet,
compact, capable of knocking a person unconscious across the length of a
corridor -- perfect for indoor guard duty.
194812: The gun is in the guard's holster.
194836: You grab for the gun; but the guard twists it out of your reach.
194872: You strike at the guard's gun, trying to knock it from him; but he
evades you.
194920: You see nothing unusual about the guard's uniform.
194952: He doesn't look like he's interested in that kind of thing.
194988: You don't have time. Stripping a limp body is impossibly awkward.
195084: The man breathes out slowly; his eyes are soft with realization. "The
ventilation duct. The
195152: Still staring past you, he thumbs a switch on his desk. "Mobile Eight?"
he says to the air. "Get down to the hallway where our friend was captured--"
There is a muffled interruption. "Yes, I know you have. You missed a leaf. Open
up ventilation grille
195314: and search inside. There should be a number of microelectronic tools
inside, and a small bundle wrapped in cloth. Report to me immediately." He
flicks the connection closed.
195426: The man spreads his hands apologetically. "I must look like a great
fool," he says to you.
195488: He continues, "It's my own fault.
195512: I can plead an excuse; we rebuilt our ventilation system from the
ground up, less than half a year ago. It's fenced and webbed and wired so that
a grain of sand couldn't sneak through -- but only at the external intakes and
the junctions. We never thought to check for an object cached just inside a
vent. We never thought it would be a
195720: He shrugs. "And it wasn't a danger, in fact, was it?"
195764: We got you; you didn't get into the lab, much less get out afterwards.
You moved a package from one hiding place to another. I still can't see--"

A
flashing light interrupts him. The man touches it, and nods. "I'll see soon.
They're bringing it in."
195920: The man absently waves you to silence.
195946: The man absently waves you to silence.
195974: A chime sounds. The man pounces on his controls, and then gestures
impatiently towards the doorway.
196042: A guard enters. She gives you only a brief professional glance.
Approaching the desk, she lays out a handful of small items.
196126: The man nods, dismissing her without a thought, and then stares. "This
was all? Where's the package?"

"With'?" asks the guard, puzzled.

"Never mind.
Go." His eyes are blazing on you as the guard slips out the doorway. "You. You
have lied to me, and I am
196304: "You have not told me where the package really is."
196334: By the man's expression, your last chance is wearing thin.
196372: , and curse all your blood," says the man flatly. His finger stabs
down.
196424: You can see the flat grey shape of your toolcase. And the
196456: boxes which are the pushbutton, timer, and toggle-switch triggers. And
the
196532: voice transmitter. That's all. There is, of course, no cloth-wrapped
package.
196586: You say the keyword. The man jerks like a lightning-struck tree at the
sound of your voice, but it is too late.
196808: You say the keyword, but nothing happens.
196834: The man jerks like a lightning-struck tree at the sound of your voice.
He stares at you, and down at his desk. Then, with a vicious curse, he begins
slamming controls.
196964: Scraps of metal lie around the pedestal, still visibly decaying.
197004: Rags of metal are scattered around the pedestal -- nothing else is left
of the chair that held you. They are dissolving to hissing mist as you watch.
197092: There's no point; soon there won't be anything left of them.
197132: There's barely enough chair left to step on, much less sit on.
197170: The scan scrambler emits a sudden frantic shrilling, which is echoed by
a buzzer through the halls of the building. Apparently it's a trick that can't
work twice.
197272: A buzzer sounds, suddenly and for no apparent reason.
197310: The remains of the chair continue to shrivel.
197342: There is now nothing left of the chair at all.
197372: There is a quiet chime from the direction of the desk. The unconscious
man does not stir. The chime is repeated; a moment later, it changes to a sharp
buzzer.
197470: A buzzer sounds suddenly through the corridors. Your time is running
tight.
197516: Your legs are beginning to itch fiercely.
197542: The itch in your legs is nearly unbearable.
197574: Your legs still itch. Just a bit.
197600: The voice module seems to have welded itself into the corroding metal.
197640: You cannot pry the voice module loose.
197664: The voice module's link isn't visible.
197688: The man is no longer interested in anything you have to say.
197720: The man is on his feet, staring at you -- stunned, and with perhaps,
somewhere underneath, a flicker of doubt.
197792: The man is sitting calmly behind his desk. He seems to have found a
gun. It is levelled at your chest.
197856: The man is stretched on the floor, dazed and unmoving. The lines of his
face are merely age, now.
197912: You run your hands over his uniform, but you find nothing.
197976: It would be too much to ask, of course, that he be carrying a gun. But
-- of course -- he was too careful to make such a mistake. You hadn't doubted
that.
198076: A limp body would be impossibly awkward, especially if you were in a
hurry. Which you might be.
198140: Satisfying though it might be, there's no more need.
198176: A sudden rush echoes in your ears, and you feel a grimace straining
your lips. The man falls back -- just a fraction -- and then your fist slams
into his belly. You shiver as he folds up, and coldly aim another blow at the
the back of his skull. The man's body hits the floor; he lies still.
198378: The man breaks from his stunned pose with a shudder. He vaults over his
desk, and drops towards you with vicious speed.
198456: You twist aside as the man's hand flashes for your temple.
198494: In grim silence, the man lashes out with one foot. You stumble;
something is horribly wrong with your knee, and you crash to the ground,
feeling pain somewhere very far away. He is on you immediately, twisting your
arm back; and then, with great precision, he cracks your head against the hard,
cold tiles.
198686: He smiles. "You came back," he says, and shoots you.
198728: The uniform is strained where its wearer lies awkwardly.
198764: It is pale, and bears no insignia but the emblem of its nation.
198800: It's a fine thought, but stripping a limp body is impossibly awkward.
And the guards aren't very likely to mistake you for their chief, no matter
what you're wearing.
198898: You stumble to a halt, as you plow into a group of hard-eyed guards.
They apparently grudge the many times you slid past them; now they waste no
time taking you down.
198996: A group of hard-eyed guards bursts in from the hallway. Their guns are
out; pulsefire is slashing into you almost before you see them.
199136: . Their guns are out; pulsefire is slashing into you almost before you
see them.
199256: snaps open. A group of hard-eyed guards bursts out, scanning the
corridor, guns levelled. Of course they see you immediately.
199332: A group of hard-eyed guards down the corridor spots you. Pulsefire
slashes through you before you can react.
199436: . They spot you instantly, and open fire.
199500: . They spot you instantly, and open fire.
199524: A group of hard-eyed guards spots you from across the corridor. Their
guns are out; pulsefire is slashing into you almost before you see them.
199608: The corridor turns here, running south and west. A single metal door
stands north; it is
199664: You move down the west corridor; but as you approach the junction, you
hear voices. The corridor to the south sounds like it's still got a full squad
of guards. And they'll be alert, now. You don't dare even look; you slide back
to the corner, as quietly as you can.
199820: The door to the north is metal. As usual, it has a black sensor plate
beside it.
199868: The door snaps open. You have a brief glimpse of a nervous-looking
janitor, surrounded by dusty crates, before he hits an override and the door
snaps shut again.

He must have hit an alarm, as well, because a sharp buzzer
sounds.
200040: snaps open -- and closed again. Someone must have hit an
override.

Someone must have hit an alarm, as well, because a sharp buzzer
sounds.
200130: A sharp buzzer sounds somewhere.
200156: The corridor cuts around a sharp angle, from the northwest to the
north. To the south, in the end wall, is the standard featureless metal door;
it is
200244: The door to the north is metal. As usual, it has a black sensor plate
beside it.
200292: You have barely room to spread your arms; this tiny square chamber is
lined with cables, pipes, wires, and junction nodes. The only exit is the
200440: The largest junction node is a shattered ruin.
200472: Cables and wires of all descriptions fill the room; they thread up the
walls, across the ceiling, and through various junction nodes.
200544: The cables and wires are securely anchored.
200572: You can't do any significant damage without a great deal more time.
200612: You could easily climb some of the cables, but it would gain you
little. There is nothing above of any use.
200676: One junction node is particularly large; several heavy power cables
feed through it.
200728: The junction nodes are all sealed.
200792: It's a door like all the rest. There is a white contact pad on one side
of the jamb. The door is
200840: You stare at the door in some embarrassment; of course it won't open
without power.

You sit down calmly to wait. It isn't too long before the
guards come with crowbars to investigate the problem.
200960: The largest junction node has been reduced to shattered ruin.
201000: The inside is a tangle of torn cabling.
201024: There's no good surface left on the smashed junction node.
201166: After several seconds, the lighting strips return to life, but they are
very dim and pulsate unevenly. You find barely enough light to pick silhouettes
out of the gloom. And the silence is oppressive. You realize that the constant
hiss of ventilation died with the lights, and it has not returned.
201384: . It sounds like yet another group of guards, moving slowly but
steadily in the darkness.
201480: , buried in shadows. It's impossible to tell how many guards there are.
201544: Their attention is just what you want least.
201572: It might be better to stay quiet.
201596: Your shot crackles down the corridor, and you hear the welcome thump of
bodies diving for cover. You cannot tell if you scored a hit.
201676: You fire again into the shadows, in the direction of the guards.
201712: It might be better to stay quiet.
201734: Through the north doorway, you can see a huge bustle of activity --
guards examining the chair, bent over the controls, and kneeling around the
unconscious figure on the floor. And, a few of them, watching the door. Several
hair-triggered guards have slashed pulse-fire into you before you or they know
what is happening.
201922: Four guards are waiting for you at the door, guns drawn. You briefly
think how little hope there was that the exit would be unguarded. Then
pulse-fire slaps darkness through you.
202028: You tear up the hall, chased by pulse-fire.
202058: As you come around the corner, you see at least a dozen figures moving
north from Security. Undoubtedly they were drawn by the gunfire. They do not
hesitate.
202156: into the teeth of the guards. They scatter in surprise; but there are
enough of them to take you down in their cross-fire.
202264: through the darkened hallways. You press silently against the wall.
Unfortunately, the hallways aren't as dark as all that, and you are spotted
immediately.
202380: : "There!" Pulse-fire crackles towards you, and this time its aim is
precise.
202432: are very close now. You consider suddenly that dangling in the middle
of the corridor is about as exposed a position as you could manage. They,
apparently, realize the same thing at the same time.
202540: are very close now. You press silently against the wall. But the
hallways aren't as dark as all that, and you are spotted immediately.
202652: . It sounds like yet another group of guards, moving slowly but
steadily in the darkness.
202734: A group of guards appears in the intersection to the west. They pause
for a moment, and two come grimly down the hall towards the closet. They are
very pleased to find you still there.
202836: Two guards appear suddenly in the doorway, silhouetted against the
flickering shadows. They were probably looking to discover what made the power
fail; they are certainly very happy to discover you.
202956: A group of guards appears in the intersection to the north. They pause
for a moment, and two move tentatively down towards where you are. They make
out your shape almost immediately.
203062: silhouettes of guards appear in the doorway. Two of them move
cautiously into the room, and within moments they see you.
203172: You twist aside as shots crackle past you; they are trying to pin you
down.
203220: A pulse splashes on the wall in front of you.
203272: nearly upon you. You can make out figures in the darkness.
203308: You're about to run out of options -- the intersection to the southeast
is occupied. The guards there are not moving. They're watching in both
directions, with their backs to a closed metal door. They don't seem to have
seen you; you slide deeper into the shadows nonetheless.
203462: There is a group of guards huddled to the southeast.
203494: A burst of pulse-fire crackles past your face, and you fall back
hastily. The intersection to the southeast is occupied; and the guards must
have heard your gunfire.
203598: Pulse-fire stitches the corridor from the southeast.
203634: You can see unconscious forms to the southeast.
203666: Pulse-fire stitches the corridor from the southeast.
203704: The guards are still figures in the gloom.
203724: The guards are up against the walls, firing at you.
203752: There are still at least three guards standing.
203776: You can see two guards firing at you.
203796: The guards to the southeast are crumpled and scattered across the
floor. None are moving.
203848: You hear footsteps approaching from the west, and whispers to the
southeast.
203892: You hear an occasional whisper from the southeast -- just sibilants in
the darkness.
203944: You hear only the crackle of pulse-fire.
203968: Their attention is just what you want least.
203996: The guards are off to the southeast.
204016: Two of the guards are unconscious in as many heartbeats. You shift your
gun, straining for a better target among the shadows, and fire again. A third
figure jerks and collapses. Then pulses are raining up the corridor at you, and
you flatten yourself into cover.
204172: You spray pulses down the corridor, and manage to knock down three of
them. Then you are driven behind the corner by their return fire.
204248: You snap off another shot, and see another guard crumple in the
southeast corridor.
204292: You line up your gun, but the shadowy figure dodges out of your line of
fire.
204336: You swing around the corner, firing quickly but without haste. One of
the remaining guards to the southeast drops; then the other.
204408: You lay a few more pulses into the unmoving bodies, for luck.
204448: It might be better to stay quiet.
204470: A shot slashes by your head, and you pull further back around the
corner.
204518: Pulse-fire crackles off the wall behind you.
204550: Another burst of shots from the southeast forces you against the wall.
204594: The guards to the southeast are still shooting at you.
204624: Six guards are standing by the door, peering into the darkness.
204660: Six guards are standing by the door, firing into the darkness.
204696: Three guards are standing in the angle, with three more motionless on
the floor.
204740: Two guards are crouched in the angle, surrounded by unconscious bodies.
204786: Unconscious guards litter the floor here.
204816: They look like six unconscious guards.
204836: You grab at a few nearby pockets, but you find nothing of immediate
value.
204884: You give the nearest body a shove. It makes you feel a little better,
but it's not very helpful.
204948: You leap at one of the guards, but she twists adroitly aside.
204988: You spray a few more pulses around, for nothing but your own
satisfaction.
205032: You fire a pulse into the nearest guard; she twitches and collapses.
You spin around, trying to line up on the others.
205100: You fire a pulse into the nearer guard; she twitches and collapses. You
spin around; the other is lining up on your back. The shot goes straight past
your ear as you hurl yourself aside; then your finger tightens again, and the
last guard is unconscious.
205252: It might be better to stay quiet.
205274: You hurry down past the sprawled forms of the guards.
205306: You turn and dive back towards the guards. This time they are not so
surprised, and their aim is steady.
205368: Hesitating when surrounded by armed guards is not the best idea. A shot
slams directly into the back of your neck, and another into your chest, and the
darkness hits like an iron hammer.
205478: You hurry down past the sprawled forms of the guards.
205510: You hit the corner at a dead run, trying to break through the guards
before they can react. You nearly do; but there are too many of them, and
pulse-fire is faster than you.
205610: You hit the corner at a dead run. The remaining guards break and fall
aside, trying to aim and roll for cover simultaneously.
205688: The guards' guns are the same sharp-lined model you've seen elsewhere.
205728: You already have a gun, and you can't waste time disarming the
unconscious.
205772: The guards seem to have their guns well in hand.
205820: You can't see the guards; they're around the curve to the southeast.
205860: You can hear voices coming from the southeast.
205884: A large crowd is standing here, debating how to deal with you. Your
reappearance presents a happy resolution to their discussion.
205964: The door begins to swing shut as soon as the pick loses its link.
206002: You spin around, ready for pursuit, but no one appears.
206042: You hear a voice from around the curve: "Wait."
206074: You hear a startled "What?" from the southeast.
206108: Voices drift up the hall. "It's only one..." "...armed, took down
nearly..." There appears to be some little debate.
206190: "Look then, we'll get a pulse grenade, is that...?"
206232: "Fine." "Fine then." "...Fine." Some of the guards sound a bit peeved.
206290: Something small and metallic rolls around the curve. It stops at your
feet. You are reaching to heave it back when a corona of pulse-fire crackles
out, and snaps you back against the wall.
206406: Several guards hustle up the corridor in best military style. They seem
surprised to see you standing; but they take care of the situation very
handily.
206530: You see something small and metallic rolling up the hallway, towards
the door. Before you can move, a corona of pulse-fire crackles out and sprays
across the room.
206628: Several guards hustle up to the door in best military style. Peering
in, they seem surprised to see you standing; but they take care of the
situation very handily.
206722: There is a muffled pounding on the door.
206750: There are several guards standing outside the door. They are quite
startled by the door's sudden opening, but their guns are ready nevertheless.
206834: The door suddenly swings open. Several guards peer in, along with
several pulse-gun muzzles.
206918: The console's display goes abruptly dead.
206950: You hear voices outside. "Well?"
206978: "The lock circuitry is knotted," comes a mumble from outside the door.
"...must have done something..."
207046: "We've got shock grenades. Should we blast?" There is a pause, and
someone replies, "No, wait on that. Whatever's in the lab, the tech crowd will
burst themselves if we fill it full of shrapnel."
207174: A voice says, "Someone ask around for a gas cutter."
207214: "Got anywhere with the lock?" you hear. There is an irritated mutter in
reply.
207268: "One of the techs thinks there's a cutter in South Storage," someone
reports.
207322: from the other side of the door. It is followed by vicious swearing.
207412: You catch, "...could be doing in there?" "Cursed if I know. They don't
tell me what kind of toys they play with."
207488: "Got it!" you hear. The door does not move. "Or, perhaps not," the
voice continues irritably.
207552: "Understand, it's been too long. Are there any explosives, things of
that sort in there?" Someone farther away replies, "No, not that we've been
told of."
207650: You hear running footsteps outside. "Found another one!" Someone
exhales in relief.
207710: There is a tight hiss from outside. "There it runs," someone says.
207758: "Keep it steady, understand. We only need a hole big enough to fire
through."
207808: A tiny red spot appears on the door. It quickly glows brighter, orange
and yellow; and then metal drips away from a white-hot hole. The shots that
come through moments later are astonishingly well-aimed.
207962: "Look at the power readout. Something's going on in there," comes a
worried mutter from outside. A louder voice calls, "Has the cursed Chief
finished his cursed nap yet?"
208078: "Yes, he cursed has." The tone is dry and amused, but the familiar
voice chills you. "What's the situation?"
208154: "It's under control, with'," someone says calmly. "The target is
trapped in the lab. We're bringing up a cutter."
208230: There is a choking sound. "Trapped in the-- in--" In all the hours you
spent in his chair, you never heard that voice lost for words.
208318: "There's only one entrance, with-commander. We're standing in front of
it," the voice continues, a little nervously now. "The walls are armor plate
underneath. The ventilation system is secure. We haven't been briefed on any
explosive or cutting equipment in the lab inventory. There's simply nowhere to
go."
208524: " the familiar voice begins, but someone interrupts: "The power is
showing a dropoff, look at that."

"All right," the man continues after a
moment. "All right. Blast the door down. Now, please."

Orders, apparently, are
orders. There is a deafening roar; the door tears into flying shards of metal.
A hail of pulse-gun fire follows the blast in. You don't stand a moment's
chance.
208808: The edge of the paper is burning.
208828: The paper is still burning, and more than half consumed.
208860: The paper is nearly consumed in flame.
208912: The paper is scorched dark brown, unreadable in places.
209072: It's the blackened, brittle remains of some paper.
209100: The ash still smells faintly of burning.
209124: You add to the ash already in your hand.
209148: You carefully brush the ash into your hand.
209176: There is no question what this place is. The room is high, brightly lit
209260: and filled with arcane, half-built, and unlabelled machinery. The heavy
door stands
209356: At the center of the chaos, and its focus, is a great silver platform
which is wrapped in a glittering cage of scan-web. A control console stands
next to it. Cables run out across the floor, from the platform to the console,
from the console to the walls, and tangle around a low cabinet off to one side.
209540: Much paper and clutter rests on a long wooden table against one wall.
The table also supports a notably large black device.
209620: Much paper and clutter rests on a long wooden table against one wall. A
few flames lick at the papers. The table also supports a notably large black
device.
209720: A long wooden table by one wall supports a notably large black device.
The table is also covered with papers, many of which are burning brightly.
209812: A long wooden table by one wall supports a notably large black device.
The table is also covered with papers, most of which are burning brightly.
209904: A long wooden table by one wall supports a notably large black device.
The table is also covered with papers, all of which are burning brightly.
209994: A long wooden table by one wall is burning fiercely. You can see a
black device distorting within the flames.
210062: A long wooden table by one wall is burning fiercely; the flames are
spreading up one wall. You can see a black device distorting within the flames.
210152: By the other wall is a clear space ringed with red, with some sort of
mat inside it.
210200: There is no door but the one you entered by.
210248: The platform is a huge disc, nearly ten feet wide; it crowds the rest
of the room's clutter out against the walls. The disc is a handspan tall.
Cables run from beneath it all across the room. It is made of some
mirror-bright metal; the top is incised with a fine concentric pattern, which
seems to reflect the lights overhead into an infinite rainbow shaft.
210468: A glittering canopy of scan-web hangs from the ceiling. It runs
entirely around the platform in a wide-draped ring. The web is fine-woven,
finer than you've ever seen -- it must run down to molecular scale, with the
waveform analysis of the wrap-around scan. A six-foot-wide flap on one side of
the cage is
210680: You can't leave the cage while the flap is closed.
210704: The platform is empty, but for yourself.
210732: You can't enter the cage while the flap is closed.
210756: You step through the open flap and onto the platform.
210784: You peel the flap of web away from its magnetic seals; it hangs open.
210828: You pull the flap back against its seals, closing yourself in the cage.
210872: You push the flap back against its seals.
210900: There is a free-standing console next to the cage, facing it, with a
view off to the side of the padded mat. On the console are two buttons, a grey
oval of contact-pad substrate, a small rectangular display above the oval, and
a readout strip. Hand-written labels are marked by each control.
211076: The display is lit with a complex, multispectral waveform.
211116: A faint hum is coming from somewhere.
211140: A loud hum is coming from somewhere.
211160: Scribbled between the grey oval and the display is the phrase
"Destination waveform." The upper button says "Ready," and the lower button is
labelled "Light the fire."
211264: You'll have to say exactly what you want to push.
211296: The upper button is labelled "Ready."
211324: There is a faint hum, and the display lights with a brightly colored
waveform.
211372: The lower button is labelled "Light the fire."
211404: The hum intensifies, coming from all around you.
211432: The hum fades to near-inaudibility.
211456: It's an unmarked oval of grey substrate, the same material as the
contact pad by the door. A label above the oval reads "Destination waveform."
211544: As the pressure on the oval moves, the waveform on the display mutates
-- wave components slide up or down, shift color, change frequency. You cannot
interpret the result... but a leap into the dark must be better than staying
here.
211684: The waveform on the display changes its configuration again.
211720: The display shows a complex waveform. Several different components
slice across the rectangle, like a rainbow of mountain ranges. You haven't the
least understanding of what they mean.
211864: You peer at the strip, on the other side of the scan-web and upside
down. It reads,
211968: "Shut down for logic adjustment."
212072: "Central systems are not active."
212120: Note: scan-web coverage not yet complete.
212152: "Unable to initiate: scan-web coverage not complete."
212188: There are wrist-thick cables running everywhere. Some lead beneath the
platform, to the equipment around the room, to the control console, to the
walls, to a nest of cable around a low cabinet off to one side.
212312: You shift a few of the cables around, but they're all well-anchored at
both ends.
212364: The cables are heavy black rubber; you cannot damage them.
212400: The cabinet is gray sheet metal, with rows of holes running down the
sides.
212444: Clearly it is a modular rack, meant to have arbitrary equipment bolted
inside and rearranged when necessary. The front is closed.
212524: The cabinet is stuffed with blocks of subcircuitry and nests of
ribbon-wiring.
212572: There is a gap at one point, however, as if a single logic plate had
been removed.
212624: The logic plate has been slotted into place.
212652: Everything in the cabinet is bolted in place.
212680: You can't put anything else in the cabinet.
212708: The low cabinet is too heavy to move.
212728: A corona of sparks showers out of the cabinet. Blue light crackles
along the subcircuit paths and across the ribbon wiring.
212804: It's just a red marking, painted on the floor around the mat.
212838: By one wall is an empty space, with a thick mat of padding inside it. A
bright red line has been painted around the mat.
212916: The mat seems to be fastened down.
212936: It's a featureless cube of polished steel.
212964: It's like hitting a solid block of metal.
213016: . It is covered with astonishing piles of paper -- scraps, notes,
diagrams, all spread unevenly around in varying stages of sortedness and
immediacy.

At one end of the table is a notable black device.
213144: . It is covered with astonishing piles of paper -- scraps, notes,
diagrams, all spread unevenly around in varying stages of sortedness and
immediacy. Flames lick at a few of the papers.

At one end of the table is a
notable black device.
213296: . It supports a notable black device, and also astonishing piles of
paper -- scraps, notes, diagrams -- many of which are burning brightly.
213384: . It supports a notable black device, and also astonishing piles of
paper -- scraps, notes, diagrams -- most of which are burning brightly.
213472: . It supports a notable black device, and also astonishing piles of
paper -- all of which are covered with sheets of fire.
213548: ; it is burning fiercely. You can see a black device distorting within
the flames.
213596: ; it is burning fiercely, and the flames are spreading up the wall. You
can see a black device distorting within the flames.
213720: You cannot approach the table to search it thoroughly. But you can make
out
213812: The wooden table is too heavy to move.
213836: There is nothing interesting under the wooden table.
213868: You can no longer reach the table, or anything on it.
213896: You can see nothing of the piles of papers but waves of flame.
213928: The remaining papers on the table consist of schedules, personal notes,
diagrams of unimportant equipment -- power supplies and the like -- blank
sheets, and an amazing number of rounds of a children's paper game, all dots
and curves.
214076: A few of the papers are on fire.
214096: You can see nothing of the piles of papers but waves of flame. You'll
never get anything from the table now.
214156: You can't reach the table from inside the cage.
214180: You quickly sort through the papers, as best you can from your briefing
lectures.
214224: You hastily sort through the papers, working around the flames as best
you can, moving important-looking papers to the floor.
214292: In a few moments, you have piled up a single stack of the most critical
diagrams, tables, formulae, and notes. Everything else is left scattered across
the table in more disarray than when you started.
214416: While sorting, you discovered a logic plate buried under a spread of
scribbled diagrams.
214476: You snatch it away from the flames.
214496: You have already sorted out everything that looks useful.
214532: You shuffle papers around, avoiding the flames.
214564: You find a logic plate underneath a spread of scribbled diagrams.
214608: There is nothing else underneath the paper except more paper.
214664: randomly pull out a scrap of paper. But you'll have to search more
carefully to find anything worth carrying away.
214784: You've already taken some scrap paper. You'll have to search more
carefully to find anything worth carrying away.
214852: You've already taken some of the scrap paper, and you already know
there's no value in what's left on the table.
214916: against one of the papers on the table. The fire catches within
moments.
214990: More of the papers on the table are burning now.
215020: The flames on the table spread.
215040: With a hiss, fire leaps to another pile of paper. Most of the papers on
the table are now aflame.
215100: The surface of the table is a sheet of fire, in-swept and pulled high
in the center.
215152: The wall above the table is beginning to catch. You can feel heat
shining on your skin.
215204: The table itself is burning hotly now.
215230: Flames are crawling up the wall. Smoke is thick across the ceiling --
fortunately, high enough that you are still below it.
215308: It's a logic plate like most, though fairly large -- wider than your
two spread hands. Circuit paths are dimly visible inside the smoky resin, and
the edges sparkle with link bands.
215416: A corona of sparks surrounds the logic plate. Blue light crackles along
the circuit paths.
215472: The black device doesn't have the half-built, rigged quality of the
other machinery nearby. It is curved, polished, and sleek. It has faired vents
along the top. There is a round alcove in its front,
215680: The device is a bit too heavy to move.
215704: You can feel warmth radiating from the alcove.
215732: You can feel heat radiating from the alcove.
215756: You can feel intense heat radiating from the alcove.
215784: The surface is streamlined smooth.
215876: It's a fat glass pot with a spout and a close-fitting lid, which leaves
the spout open. There is a wooden handle on one side.
215948: An oily, burning odor fills the room, although you cannot see any
smoke.
215996: The pot is empty; but the inside bottom surface seems to be crusted
with some burnt substance.
216052: The burnt crust is stuck to the bottom of the pot.
216080: The glass is burning hot; you jerk away.
216108: You feel the heat radiating from the glass. Fortunately, the handle is
cool.
216152: You feel blistering heat radiating from the glass. Fortunately, the
handle is merely warm.
216204: There is a burnt crust of some dark substance caking the bottom of the
glass pot.
216252: An oily, burnt odor rises from the pot.
216276: A powerful odor emanates from the pot -- oily, burnt, but aromatic
nevertheless.
216328: You can't reach through the spout to the burnt substance.
216356: The tiny switch begins to glow red as you turn it on.
216392: The tiny switch turns black again.
216436: The walls are faced with tough white composite.
216464: Flames are licking up the wall above the table. It takes a while for
composite to catch, but apparently it has.
216536: The ceiling is high, more than twice as high as the panelling you have
seen elsewhere. You cannot see what it is made of.
216604: The ceiling here is far out of reach.
216648: There is a small white pad beside it, and an access panel.
216684: It's a dull white rectangle, about the width of two of your fingers.
There's an access panel below it.
216748: There is a sharp blue spark somewhere under the surface of the pad.
216788: There is a small access panel next to the door, below the contact pad.
216828: It is open; you can see a layer of subcircuitry inside.
216864: You see subcircuitry behind the open panel.
216888: You can't put anything in the panel.
216908: You pull the panel open, revealing a layer of subcircuitry.
216944: You can't analyze subcircuitry with the unaided eye.
216976: showers a corona of sparks. Blue light crackles along the subcircuit
paths.
217068: You smack the circuitry with the heel of your hand. It makes a very
satisfactory crunching sound.
217128: It's a nearly blank sheet, with a few sums scribbled on it.
217168: It's no more interesting than the last one.
217192: Your people probably already know that 844.625 times 6.283 is 5306.779.
217248: You have no notion what any of it means, but it all matches the profile
you were given of material relevant to the work done here.
217320: Nowhere...
217330: " the familiar voice begins, and there is a terrible silence.

Then,
"Blast it down," he says, very quietly. And screams, "
217416: BLAST IT!
217428: But a light is pouring out of the scan-web cage, a sourceless glow that
seems to shine straight through solidity, as if metal and plastic were starlit
ice. The light builds and builds...
217568: You shake your head in slow wonder. Unfortunately, a moment later, the
guards outside recall you to yourself. There is a deafening roar; the door
tears into flying shards of metal. A hail of pulse-gun fire follows the blast
in. You don't stand a moment's chance.
217732: But a light is pouring out around you, a sourceless glow that seems to
shine straight through solidity, as if metal and plastic were starlit ice. The
light builds and builds...
217842: Beyond the light you see the door burst open, with a distant, dreamlike
roar. The lucent faces that crowd through seem to move in slow motion. Their
guns are firing, but the pulses are frozen in space. You can see their eyes
slide across you, the cage around you
218044: . You can dimly feel yourself falling to a padded surface, and the
shouts of the guards go on -- until you are hauled to your feet, and the muzzle
of a pulse-gun is pressed to the back of your head.
218158: Then the world vanishes. Blackness slaps into you with a silent
218208: On the whole, it was worth the trip. The plains really were broad and
grain-gold, if scarred with fences and agricultural crawlers. The mountains
were overwhelming. And however much of the capital city is crusted with squat
brick and faceless concrete hulks, there are still flashes of its historic
charm. You've seen spires above the streets -- tiny green parks below tenements
-- hidden jewels of fountains beyond walls. Any bland alley can conceal
balconies wrought into iron gardens, fiery mosaics, a tree or bed of flowers
nurtured by who knows who.
218550: This alley, however, is a total washout. It ends in flat bare dirty
brick, and you've found nothing but a door which lacks even the courtesy of a
handle. Maybe you should call it a day.
218672: That isn't a direction you can go in.
218696: That isn't a direction you can throw things.
