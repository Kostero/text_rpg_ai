24057: Nothing to do!
24202: It is now pitch dark in here!
24229: I beg your pardon?
24293: Sorry, that can't be corrected.
24322: Think nothing of it.
24370: You can hardly repeat that.
24395: You can't begin with a comma.
24437: You can't talk to #o#.
24488: I didn't understand that number.
24517: You can't see any such thing.
24553: You don't have that.
24593: I'm not sure what "
24645: That's not a verb I recognise.
24684: You can't see "
24792: Nothing to do!
24809: There are none at all available!
25123: No such object exists.
25146: No such room exists.
26227: There is no reply.
26246: Violence won't help matters.
26311: Nothing is on sale.
26574: Dropped.
26699: qxn#A# eat#s# #o#. Not bad.
26832: That isn't possible.
27433: You'll have to open #o# first.
27749: But there's no liquid here.
28179: That was easy.
28223: No movement to continue!
28843: Keep your mind on the game.
28875: That would be difficult.
29072: Wdoxn#A# lock#s# #o#.
29351: But it's dark.
29402: That was a rhetorical question.

29885: Nothing obvious happens.
29957: Not that way #a-s# can't.
30230: Please answer yes or no.
30256: Are you sure you want to quit?
30301: Failed.
30321: Restore failed.
30338: Ok.
30387: Save failed.
30402: Ok.
30509: Transcripting is already off.
30575: Transcripting is already on.
30641: But it's dark.
30914: Oh, don't apologise.
30984: And so's your mother!
31005: There's nowhere to do that here.
31198: Taken.
31546: Taking #o# is impossible.
31567: What a fascinating concept.
31663: This provokes no reaction.
31688: You'll have to do that yourself.
31724: Futile.
31745: That would be pointless.
31776: That might not be appreciated.
31834: If you think that'll help.
32021: Time passes.
32061: That seems unnecessary.
32093: Hi!

#A# enter#s#.
66539: Press a key to exit.
67913: You can't see any such thing.
68553: What fruit?
69537: Biggs' lifeless body lies here.
69983: Biggs cries, "Oww. My leg!!".
70364: Biggs smells funny.
70863: The bear giggles.
71320: Sometimes it's fun to giggle!
71365: You can't see any such thing.
71478: You can't see any such thing.
71512: How would you use those here?
71650: Exits are:

75720: You can't go that way.
75976: [Your interpreter does not provide "undo". Sorry!]
76064: Please give one of the answers above.
76092: [You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
76128: [Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
76168: "Oops" can only correct a single word.
76196: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
76228: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
76288: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
76332: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
76372: I didn't understand that sentence.
76432: You seem to have said too little!
76456: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
76492: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
76528: You excepted something not included anyway!
76560: That can only be done to something animate.
76592: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
76640: I didn't understand the way that finished.
76672: Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which exactly?
76844: This dangerous act would achieve little.
76908: Digging would achieve nothing here.
76936: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
76992: You'll have to put #o# down first.
77020: Darkness, noun. An absence of light to see by.
77124: But #a-s# #is#n't in anything at the moment.
77160: There don't appear to be any exits.
77188: But #he's# not on #o# at the moment.

77684: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations.
77744: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations.
77804: First #a-s# will have to close #o#.
77856: That would be less than courteous.
77880: Is that the best you can think of?
78144: Are you sure you want to restart?
78168: Attempt to end transcript failed.
78192: Attempt to begin transcript failed.
78292: That would hardly be appropriate.
78316: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
78500: The game file has verified as intact.
78528: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupt.
78952: As good-looking as ever.
79040: You are standing amidst the snow covered trees of Burly Forest, looking
upward to the mountain you're delaying climbing.
79196: Chickening out? That's okay. This game was probably boring anyway. Why
not go down to your local Tandy store and see what kinds of new products are
available?
79308: The snow covered trees of Burly forest dot the otherwise uneventful
landscape.
79364: Rocky holds push their way out of this incline here and there, making it
a little less of an incline and a little more of a climb. The foot of the
mountain is a fair way down from here. Up above you, you can see a nice (much
more comfortable) plateau you'd rather be standing on.
79560: The mountain is impassable in that direction.
79604: From here, it feels as though you could reach down and touch the foot of
the mountain. But you'd rather not.
79680: It's rather cloudy here.
79698: The cloud cover here has become quite dense.
79736: A cluster of dark clouds has gathered over the sky here.
79776: Clouds shift away, revealing a clear blue sky.
79812: Dark clouds move in overhead, obscuring the otherwise clear sky.
79860: Up above you is a much flatter point where the mountain plateaus.
79908: It's rock hard and stone-like.
79932: You're using the holds to climb your way up (or down) the mountain.
They're deceptive in size, and can often shelter plant life, animals and
sometimes Tandy computers inside them.
80060: You're using the holds to climb your way up (or down) the mountain.
They're deceptive in size, and can often shelter plant life and animals inside
them.
80168: The metal tweezers are cold to the touch and look ... useful.
80212: Sort of an intersection of treacherous climbs, this plateau disappears
into a more rubble-like path around both the east and west sides of the
mountain. A brief sigh of lack of accomplishment falls upon you as you look up
to see how much of the mountain you've yet to climb. You know, you could always
go back down.
80432: The mountain is impassable in that direction.
80484: Although mostly rubble, the path looks quite easy to cross.
80528: This is certainly the more rocky side of the mountain. However, you're
not terribly sure about the narrow ledge you're now standing on. It looks as
though it could collapse at any moment. You'd much rather be east or west of
here, where the ledge widens out.
80712: This is certainly the more rocky side of the mountain. A large amount of
the ledge here has collapsed, making it harder to cross to either the east or
west.
80820: The mountain is impassable in that direction.
80864: Just your average red cloth. Never know when it might come in handy.
80916: This is a rather odd little mountain village, nestled in what seems like
a small valley. Huts gather in a circle around the coals of an unlit open
fireplace. You can't continue your climb here, you'll have to head back east to
the plateau.
81082: The natives here seem almost scared of you.
81118: You seem to have interrupted some sort of tribal dance. Silence falls
upon the village as dozens of eyes turn to you and your injured companion
Biggs.

Calmly, what appears to be a witchdoctor of the tribe approaches Biggs.
Examining his leg, the witchdoctor takes a small fruit from around her neck and
squeezes it over the wound. Almost magically, Biggs' gaping wound closes up
tight, saving his life. Shocked and amazed, you watch as Biggs stands up on
both legs and appears perfectly healthy.

Over the coming weeks, you spend much
time in the village, learning the language and customs of the tribal people.
Eventually, you manage to communicate your amazement at the witchdoctor's
lifesaving act and convince the tribesmen to allow you to take several of the
miracle fruits back home with you. You arrive to unsurpassed fame as the
discoverer of both a long lost civilisation and a miracle cure for severe
bleeding of the leg. Biggs stays with the village after falling hopelessly in
love with the witchdoctor.
81826: It appears you've walked in on the weekly human sacrificial ceremony of
the mountain natives. There aren't many natives here (possibly because of their
weekly sacrifices), but they look fierce and stereotypically bone-nosed. One
particularly fierce looking native stands and blocks your path back east. He
then utters some jibberish which sounds not unlike "Any last words?".
82096: There's a big, bulky native guard blocking your path.
82136: The mountain is impassable in that direction.
82168: The borders of the village prevent you from travelling in that
direction.
82218: Unable to hold back the natives any longer, and figuring that nobody's
going to hear you at this point, you start screaming like a girl! After that,
the natives invite you to visit their god. So, they put you on their God
visiting table and perform a few special rituals which tickle!
82420: Unable to hold back the natives any longer, and figuring that nobody's
going to hear you at this point, you start screaming like a girl! How
humiliating, being sacrificed to the heathen god of the mountain natives.
82572: The huts are primitive, but a viable shelter for the native people of
these parts. The roofs of them are thatched.
82652: The fireplace looks recently used. One patch of it is still smouldering.
82704: The plateau looks like a good place to be right now.
82740: For all it's worth, they seem to add a sense of culture to the place.
82808: Tall, thin trees surround this clearing on the mountainside. Every now
and then brightly coloured fairies flicker amongst them. The almost forest area
gives way to a path leading up the mountain and thins out to both the east and
west.
82970: Tall, thin trees surround this clearing on the mountainside. Every now
and then flashing lights will flicker amongst their trunks. There's something a
little strange about this area. It couldn't be fairies, they don't exist, do
they? The almost forest area gives way to a path leading up the mountain and
thins out to both the east and west.
83212: Faintly, you can here peculiar voices singing merrily, "We live on top
of a magic tree, magic tree, magic tree!".
83300: The mountain is impassable in that direction.
83332: The mountain is impassible in that direction.
83364: The mountain is impassible in that direction.
83396: Hmm... looking carefully downwards, you manage to find a navigatable
route. Awkwardly, you tumble down...
83476: You talk to the flickering lights, but they don't talk back.
83520: Beautiful specimens of pine trees dot the surrounds of this clearing.
83568: You could have sworn you saw something flicker in the trees.
83616: The path to the east ends in a small cave. Cautiously, you enter. Before
you stands the most amazing sight! It's stacked to the cave ceiling with
glories gold trophies of assorted kinds! Golden bricks, vases and lamps just to
name a few. You can see twinkling lights in a clearing back to the west.
83826: Suddenly, masses of bright light swarm in from the west. Before you have
time to react, the lights take all the non-gold bits out of your body and turn
you gold. As the world fades away to black, you can't help but think how fun
this is!
83996: Suddenly, masses of bright light swarm in from the west. Before you have
time to react, the lights drill painfully through your body. As the world fades
away to black, you hear a harmonious chant over and over:

Pesky human
adventurer;
You'll become our treasure!

It appears you weren't the first to
make this mistake.
84228: Your ring glows brightly for a fleeting moment. You feel reassured.
84276: This cave only has one exit to the west.
84304: It must be the mountain air playing tricks on your eyes. You're sure you
saw something flicker.
84372: Piles of fabulous treasures are stacked here.
84404: The piles of shiny vases, gold bricks, lamps and other trophies just
make you want to take them. Take them!
84480: As you reach for the treasure, you feel a strange sensation tingle up
your right forearm. Looking down you notice that your hand has stiffened and
turned to gold! As you stand there helpless, you
84616: .

It appears you may look but not touch, regarding the cave of riches.
84668: Besides, why do you need all that silly gold when you've got a Tandy?
84724: This area is certainly well hidden. Up above you, you can barely make
out the clearing from where you came. Other than that, you can't really say
much about this secret enclave. The view is magnificent.
84868: The mountain is *really* impassable in that direction.
84912: Below you is a running river of icy cold water. Shards of icebergs float
downstream.
84972: Above you, you see the deceptive hidden path you travelled along to get
here from the clearing above.
85044: This curious looking tree bares a single small, round fruit.
85088: The curious looking tree is completely bare.
85120: The curious little fruit seems to glow in your hand. You sense that it
is either very magical, or dangerous and should be dropped. Or both!
85220: The curious little fruit glows rhythmically.
85252: As you eat the glowing fruit, you feel refreshed and renewed inside, as
if by some magical force. Before you realise, you've eaten the entire fruit.
Boy, that really tasted delicious!
85384: You already picked the only fruit from this tree.
85420: You deftly pluck the single fruit from the tree.
85454: As you squeeze magical juice from the fruit, the liquid is absorbed by
Biggs' leg. Amazingly, you watch as Biggs' leg is completely healed before your
eyes. Even more surprisingly, Biggs appears completely healed as he gets up
from the ground.
85630: As you squeeze magical juice from the fruit, the liquid is absorbed by
Biggs' leg. Amazingly, you watch as Biggs' leg is completely healed before your
eyes. Even more surprisingly, Biggs appears completely healed as he gets up
from your arms.
85804: You squeeze the glowing juices from the fruit. The fruit disappears as
the juices fall to the ground. You feel as though you might have missed
something. Never mind, we just won't tell anyone about this.
85948: Strange, after you squeeze the fruit, the villagers approach you as
though they aren't scared anymore. Wait a minute, they *aren't* scared anymore!
They close in...
86074: It appears they've decided to include you in their weekly human
sacrificial ceremony. One particularly fierce looking native stands and blocks
your path back east. He then utters some jibberish which sounds not unlike "Any
last words?".
86260: You're standing along an obvious trail between the grove below and the
top of the mountain above. It's a little rocky here, but not unclimbable. Well,
not for an over inflated ego such as your own. A flat, passable track branches
off here to the east.
86436: The mountain is impassable in that direction.
86468: Wide and flat, the branching track looks very easy to navigate.
86512: Climbing up the mountain, you notice that there's very little mountain
left to climb. In fact, pretty soon there's none. At last! You've conquered
Burly Mountain. See, it wasn't that hard, was it? Actually, maybe it was a
little to easy. Nah, let's bask in the glory.
86720: Many winter snowfalls have taken their toll on this traverse. Hard,
easily grippable rock has given away to a mostly smooth icy surface. Stray from
the path here, and you'll most likely fall to your icy death. You shudder as
you imagine sliding helplessly downward.
86904: Gripping the rock with all your might, you attempt to scale the iced up
rocks. Unfortunately, your foot slides awkwardly, causing you to plummet
happily through the sky to a trampoline below. You have so much fun bouncing
all day, you just can't be bothered climbing anymore.
87096: Gripping the rock with all your might, you attempt to scale the iced up
rocks. Unfortunately, your foot slides awkwardly, causing you to plummet
through the sky to the ground below. Twitching on the ground, physical injuries
overcome you.
87264: You nearly slipped and fell. You can't go that way from here.
87308: Piles of snow litter the otherwise dangerously flat ice.
87364: You feel like you've climbed most of the mountain up here, and in
reality, you probably have. Just above you, you can see what appears to be the
highest point of Burly Mountain. Below you lies a slippery slope which looks
dangerously icey. To the west is a well-beaten walking trail.
87564: The mountain is impassable in that direction.
87596: You'd like to climb higher, but you're afraid that the large brown bear
wouldn't agree with that course of action.
87676: It's just about within your reach.
87704: You'll need to get rid of that pesky bear first, however.
87748: The slope below is a death trap waiting to take you express down the
mountainside.
87804: Covered in loose stones, the walking trail leads west and slopes
downward.
87856: At last, you've finally done it. You've scaled the entirety of Burly
Mountain! You take in the absolutely awe inspiring views of Burly's smaller
peaks that surround you. But all too soon, you long for home and the chance to
tell all of your peers how you scaled the toughest mountain terrain ever seen
by man! (Even if it wasn't that tough anyway. *wink*)
88112: Oh, and somewhere along the line Biggs was invovled. I don't know...
carrying all of your supplies and rations. Something trivial like that.
88236: The mountain is impassable in that direction.
88268: This brisk little path extends from east to west, sloping downward to
the west. The path is flat and easy to navigate. It's almost impossible to
believe that it wasn't manmade. Turning to the east, looking over the plateau
gives you an excellent view of the mountain range.
88460: The plateau to the east looks out over lush valleys and forests below.
88508: The mountain is impassable in that direction.
88550: You're standing midway along an oddly flat walking trail. In the centre
of the trail here are three stone monuments. All three are are roughly cube
shaped, but worn with time. How silly the look just sitting here, fixed in
place. The trail continues out to both the east and the west.
88752: The odd little seats are fixed obstacles along this mountain path.
88800: Not at all marvellous, the stone monuments sit at about the height of
three awkward little seats. In fact, you could probably sit on them.
88896: You sit down on one of the three stone monuments.
88932: There is a slight rumble from around the monuments.
88970: The earth shakes a little near the monuments.
89006: There is a pronounced rumbling from near the monuments.
89048: The entire area begins shaking violently! Biggs fervently graps one of
the monuments, and you to the same. The rock is thrown and smashed!

As the
mild earthquake subsides and the monuments finish their rumbling, you pick
yourself up, dust yourself off and make out to Biggs that you planned things
that way. Looking down, you notice a brass ring that wasn't there before.
89312: Revealed from your meddling with matters arcane, this ring seems to hold
a certain unseen power. Engraved on the band are the words, "TO PROTECT".
89444: The mountain is impassable in that direction.
89476: This brisk little path extends from east to west, sloping downward to
the west. The path is flat and easy to navigate. It's almost impossible to
believe that it wasn't manmade. To the west, you can see a mountain ridge.
89632: Looking west, you see this walking trail intersect with an upper ridge
of the mountain.
89692: You shout madly at Biggs' corpse, hoping he's just unconcious, but to no
avail.
89752: Biggs replies, "This is all your fault, Hikerson!".
89792: Biggs replies, "I hope there's a decent cure for gaping leg wounds.".
89844: "I promise I won't stumble again.", Biggs pledges.
89928: .", Biggs replies. Biggs in now sitting on one of the monuments.
89976: "Alright, I'll get off. Sitting here is boring anyway.", claims Biggs.
90032: "I'm a little bit hungry.", says Biggs.
90108: . Though, legends say that fairies are attracted by laughter.", Biggs
suggests.
90168: "I suggest we head upward", notes Biggs.
90232: "I'm probably more tired than you are.", says Biggs.
90272: Biggs seems a little more comfortable on the monuments, but still in
obvious pain.
90332: Biggs is so happy to be adventuring, he's writhing all over the ground!
What a funny fellow.
90400: Biggs is writhing along the ground in pain, struggling to move.
90448: Biggs is sitting here, legs crossed.
90476: Biggs is standing by you, always supportive.
90508: Biggs is standing here, tired and impatient.
90540: Biggs isn't as active as he used to be. Maybe because he's so busy in
hiking companion heaven. Gee you'll miss him!
90624: Biggs has a really BIG boo-boo on his leg! If you don't fix it soon,
Biggs might start to cry.
90696: On all of your mountain climbing expeditions, you've always taken Biggs.
He's reliable, almost maintenance free, but most importantly, he's your best
friend. Golly gosh, he's just such a good friend and quite the
conversationalist.
90864: Biggs' lifeless body lies motionless on the ground. In a way, you're
kind of glad to be free from all that constant chatter and nagging. In fact, in
you're glad in every way! More glory for
91000: Biggs' leg is torn and battered, but other than that, he seems his usual
impatient, nagging self. His eyes look pale though, and he's lost a lot of
blood. You feel as though you should do something to help.
91148: On all of your mountain climbing expeditions, you've always taken Biggs.
He's reliable, almost maintenance free, but most importantly, he's ugly. Thin
and lanky with a wirey moustache, he looks rather like a ringmaster. It's safe
to say that as far as looks go, he poses absolutely no competition to you.
(Rather important for when you're chasing after highly attractive native girls
of the mountains of the world.)
91444: You kick Biggs' corpse a little. Come on! He was painful to have around.
91500: "Oww!", cries Biggs, "Sir, that hurts. Above the waist, please!".
91556: You can't carry Biggs' corpse. It feels far too morbid an act. Besides,
he
91612: With a superhuman effort, you struggle, but manage to carry all of Biggs
weight.
91672: Biggs chuckles, "You know there's know need of that sir, I'm perfectly
capable of moving myself around!".
91750: Biggs asks you gaspingly to help quickly.
91784: Biggs moans, "Where? Is that you mother?". He must be delusional!
There's not much time.
91856: Biggs stops breathing. *sigh* Oh well. You give him a big kiss and say
"I'll miss you Biggs!", or something like that. Biggs says, "I'll miss you too,
91976: .", *croak*. Oh boy, this'll make a great story for the folks back home
when you return. You leave his lifeless body to rest on the ground.
92082: Biggs breathing becomes more shallow. You give Biggs a slight shake to
get him talking (complaining) again. Nothing. "Biggs!", you cry, "Biggs!!".
Biggs' eyes roll back in his head. Your only companion on this hike died in
your own arms! Oh boy, this'll make a great story for the folks back home when
you return. You leave his lifeless body to rest on the ground.
92352: You turn to Biggs to check on him. His leg is twitching a little less
than usual, he must be really sleepy. Oh well, you turn away and let him have a
snooze.
92466: You turn to Biggs to check on him. His leg is twitching a little less
than usual, perhaps the pain has finally settled down. Oh wait! He's not
breathing either! Oh no! Poor Biggs' leg wound was fatal! Perhaps you should
have done more to help him. Nah, who needs him?
92664: Biggs is his usual indefensible self.
92692: Poor old Biggs follows you, panting heavily.
92726: "Hoo, we're going to be boiled in oil by these natives, I can just feel
it, sir", Biggs hypothesises.
92804: Biggs seems more nervous than you are. Of course he's more nervous,
you've got a brilliant escape plan! Haven't you?
92890: You're pretty sure Biggs has messed himself.
92926: Biggs exclaims, "Hoo boy! I sure love climbing!".
92968: Biggs seems more than a little puffed.
92996: Biggs pants, "We sure have climbed a lot today sir, haven't we?".
93048: "I think I lost my sense of adventure back there. We'll have to turn
'round!", Biggs declares.
93120: With somewhat undue eagerness, Biggs races past you. Clumsily, he slips
and tumbles on the ledge. Suddenly piles of big cushy foam rocks tumble down on
him. He giggles, "This tickles! Oh drat, my leg!".

Oh dear, it appears Biggs
has got a nasty boo-boo on his leg. Bother!
93324: With somewhat undue eagerness, Biggs races past you. Clumsily, he slips
and tumbles on the ledge. Suddenly piles of rocks cascade down upon him. He
screams in agony as shards of the mountain tear apart his leg!

Hmm... you
can't decide whether you should assist Biggs with his now broken leg or go on
to claim greater glory for your "solo" expedition.
93576: The small pink fairy that you seem to have befriended flutters aimlessly
amongst the clearing.
93644: "There should be more colours! Oh, and balloons, everyone likes
balloons!", the fairy replies.
93716: "Talking is boring! Let's play tickles.", the fairy suggests.
93764: The fairy notes, "Humans, of all the creatures on Earth, are generally
fatter.".
93824: The fairy says, "Why, I talk to the flowers all the time!".
93872: "There should be more colours! Oh, and balloons, everyone likes
balloons!", the fairy replies.
93944: "While we're standing here, the world is going round and round and
round.", claims the fairy.
94012: The fairy replies, "You seem like a nice enough fellow, come visit our
magical treasure cave to the east any time!". Wow. You sure are a charmer.
94120: The fairy says, "Why, I talk to the flowers all the time!".
94224: . I don't know, maybe you're sick.
94252: Take a ball of light. Give it a little too much mental freedom and
you've got a fairy. It's so sparkly!
94328: Take a ball of light. Give it a little too much mental freedom and
you've got a fairy. It's twinkling often enough to make you sick.
94424: , brown bear blocks your path upward. The thing takes up the entire
climbable path and looks like it's either insanely mad or in severe pain.
94524: Now, now. We don't want to hurt the poor bear.
94560: Nice try. Was that a touch of bravery or stupidy? You lunge at the bear
with all your might. In turn, the bear takes your face off with one effortless
swipe. (Ouch!)
94680: Upon closer inspection, you notice that the bear's foot has a small
splinter in it. No wonder it's so mad.
94756: If only you had some sort of surgical equipment.
94792: The bear takes a swipe at you! Lucky miss. You're uninjured.
94838: It gives Biggs a big happy wave.
94866: It's claws nip Biggs on the nose.
94894: Suddenly, the bear speaks! "Hey, aren't you bored of just hanging around
this mountain? Let's go to our local Tandy store!", he suggests. So off you all
trot, merrily down to the Tandy store.

When you arrive, the shopkeeper says
that bears aren't allowed in Tandy stores. He smiles and escorts the bear down
to the rug factory (where the shopkeeper says he'll have a much better time).
What an adventure!
95188: The brown bear strikes you directly in the throat, incapacitating you,
and knocking you to the ground, lifeless. It seems it tired of you just hanging
around it's rocky plateau.
95312: Burly Mountain isn't the biggest of the big mountains. Gosh golly darn
it, it's not even the biggest of the smaller mountains. It's really not that
tough a climb at all, considering. But being the rich, young, egocentric,
expert bragger Gary Hikerson, you'll be happy to pretend it was. That is, once
you get back down safely, of course.

Yes indeed, you've never been one to let
any obstacle stand in the way of your prospective fame. Well, that was until
you found yourself standing at the foot of this exceptionally large mountain
that you haven't even begun to climb...
95722: Burly Mountain isn't the biggest of the big mountains. Hell, it's not

Yes indeed, you've never been one to let any obstacle stand

standing at the foot of this dirty great big mountain that you haven't even
begun to climb...
96122: Oh, and with you is your good friend Biggs! My goodness, you're just so
lucky to have him.
96192: Oh, and with you is your lesser, uglier and much shorter companion
Biggs. Enough said. Now, on with the show!
96340: Your shining smile, your chiseled chin. No wonder all the girls just
can't resist you.
96404: Your shining smile, your chiseled chin. No wonder all the girls just
can't resist you, and Biggs too!
96480: Your shining smile, your chiseled chin. No wonder all the girls just
can't resist you, especially when pitched against Biggs, your companion.
96580: Different coloured fairies swarm around the trees merrily as you giggle,
but no more are brave enough to show themselves.
96664: As you gigle heartily, the flashing lights become more frequent, until
one of them flies towards you and gives you a big boo-boo on your nose. You are
struck with such force that topple merrily to the ground and don't hurt
yourself at all.

A small glowing pink fairy inquires, "Hello?". "Boys have boy
germs!", she notes.
96896: As you gigle heartily, the flashing lights become more frequent, until
one of them flies towards you and bumps you smack in the nose. You are struck
with such force that you immediately hit the ground.

A small glowing pink
fairy inquires, "Hello?". "You look handsome!", she notes.
97100: Insanity sets in as you giggle to yourself.
97132: "What're you gigglin' about?", asks Biggs.
97168: You deftly attempt to pluck the splinter out of the bear's foot with
your hand. The bear's a bit grumpy so he *censored* *censored* *censored*.
Anyway, you all sit down afterwards in text adventure heaven and have a nice
tea party.
97340: You deftly attempt to pluck the splinter out of the bear's foot with
your hand. The bear deftly attempts to thank you with a clean swipe of its
claws across your face.
97456: Success! Immediately after pulling the splinter from the bear's body
with the tweezers, the bear calms down. It takes an almost friendly approach to
you as it scuttles down the mountainside. Golly you're brave.
97604: The world seems strangely altered.

A hollow voice says, "Loof.".
97656: The world feels strangely normal.
97680: Nothing is normal in the world of Tandy!
97712: Nuts! I, er... you were enjoying that.
97744: Success! Immediately after pulling the splinter from the bear's body
with the tweezers, the bear calms down. It takes an almost friendly approach to
you as it scuttles down the mountainside. If only the folks back home coould
see you now. Oh, how you'd brag!
97928: , an avid mountaineer and extremely er, self-confident. Paired with your
companion Biggs, your goal is to scale Burly Mountain.

Sounds easy? It can be.
The idea of Mountain is to provide many paths (most of them deaths) in order to
frustrate the player. Really. It's the most insane thrill ride of guessing the
verb you'll ever have. Plus, it's got plenty of replay value, albeit at the
cost of violating the player's bill of rights.

So get stuck in, put your
hiking shoes on, and turn the air conditioner up to high (for realism) for ...
Mountain!
98726: ".

Some special commands exist to help you control gameplay, such
as:
SAVE                                    RESTORE
RESTART                    
            QUIT
UNDO                                    HELP
SCORE            
                      FULL SCORE
VERBOSE                                
BRIEF
(Just to name a few.)

Finally, remember that you can use a variety of
English structures to form commands. Even the following are valid:
TAKE THE
BALL AND THE BAT
DROP ALL EXCEPT THE WALLET

Most importantly, (for those
familiar with other games) Mountain does *not* use the "ordering" system
of:
COMMANDER, TAKE THE HELM
Instead, these orders can be replaced with the
simpler command:
TALK TO COMMANDER

And of course, if you're stuck, you can
always have a guess.
99370: Warning, this section contains spoilers! If you don't want the game
absolutely ruined forever, don't move your eyes below this point!

Possibly the
most straight-forward way to complete your hike is to get past the brown bear.
How, you ask? It's problem is not that it's angry, but that it has a sore foot.
What you need to solve this problem is a pair of tweezers or somesuch with
which to remove the splinter. Where would you find such a thing? I don't know,
look around (and inside) some of the alpine scenery.

Vague, eh? Well, sorry,
that's your lot as far as hints and tips go.
