82996: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
83872: Looking for a little hint? 
Well, let's see...


First, let me determine
what you're stuck on...
83956: Your mom cant sign the slip if she doesn't have it.
83992: You might check the laundry room.
84016: Ask your mom about the flashlight.
84040: You might get thirsty on your trip.
84068: That flashlight might not work without batteries.
84104: If you think you're ready to go and nothing's happening, how do you SHOW
your Mom you're ready to leave?
84184: Uh-oh. You FORGOT (or didn't FIND) Your permission slip. Better ASK the
scoutmaster about it.
84264: Better examine that permission slip.
84292: The permission slip's unsigned. Now who could help you?
84332: Better ASK the Scoutmaster about it. Maybe he can call your Mom.
84384: Don't know what you want a hint for. Just hang around until time to
leave.
84518: But you know, these trips take time. OR, you can examine your items and
see whether their ready for a trip in the dark.
84604: Well, it would be GREAT if you had a first aid kit, wouldn't it? since
you haven't got one, (It's probably back at home) You'll either need to leave
your buddy here or RESTART or RESTORE and try again.
84760: Why don't you examine that first aid kit? Maybe it could help Ryan.
84812: Perhaps you could find something useful in the First Aid Kit.
84856: Perhaps you could find something useful in the First Aid Kit.
84940: Notice that Ryan is struggling to swallow. Wonder if there's any water
nearby that might help him?
85012: Ryan needs Tylenol and some water to wash it down with. If you are
missing either one, put up with his griping (remember, he's in pain!) and move
on. Ryan will come with you. He wants to get out as much as you do... And if
you find water later on, you might try again...
85208: Have patience. That's all the hints I have on Ryan's pain.
85252: You are probably carrying items that are too large.
85288: Examine the rocks. Perhaps you need something to dig or break them.
85336: Aren't you carrying something you can use to Break Rocks?
85380: Examine the rocks. Perhaps you need something to cross this river.
85428: Hint 1: You are carrying something that looks a little like a bridge...
85480: Hint 2: Perhaps Your buddy can help you.
85512: Last Hint: Try giving the plank to Ryan, to see what he does with it.
85564: Hint 1: Have you been everywhere? There is a place that looks like a
pink tongue.
85624: Hint 1: Have you been everywhere? If so, this location should seem
familiar to you somehow. LOOK and read the room description carefully.
85724: Hint 2: There's a point across the way you should have visited. It will
give you a clue where to go.
85796: Last Hint: The description at LOOKOUT POINT will tell you what to do.
85856: I'm not quite sure what kind of help you need. Why not try typing
"HELP"?
86060: Your eyelids are beginning to droop. All this excitement can be very
draining.
86116: You are becoming EXTREMELY tired. Perhaps you can simply lay down and
rest.
86176: And in a cave that's not the BEST condition to be in. You collapse and
pitch forward, falling into a pit blacker than night.
86268: Whipping out your trusty sleeping bag, you get some quick sleep. You're
buddies wake you up when it's time to go.
86352: Was that a bear growling or was it your tummy rumbling!?.
86396: Your hunger is making you weak and dizzy. You wonder what will become of
you if you starve to death?
86472: gasp you realize that your hunger is too much for you. You collapse and
expire from starvation.
86540: Your Mom comes into the room and tells you it's time to go to the
Church. She packs you and everything you've packed into the car and hauls you
up there.
86648: Your friend Ryan shows up with his Mom. With a wink and grin at you, he
grabs his pack and sleeping bag from the car and kisses his mom goodbye. 'Hey',
he calls at you. 'Let's help load the bus!'.
86792: You and your friend Ryan help load the bus. You get in the line and
start passing equipment down the line.
86868: Most of the gear is loaded on the bus now, and you get to wander off for
a bit. Ryan wanders off with you.
87036: Well, the Scoutmaster has signalled that it's time to pray and move out.
87088: As each boy boards the bus, the Scoutmaster collects his permission
slip.
87184: After a quick prayer the troop gets on the road.
87220: The scoutmaster double-checks your slip and points out that you failed
to get your mother to sign it. Unfortunately, that means you have to stay
behind and miss the trip, since the troop can't wait for your mother to come up
to the church and sign your slip. You are put off the bus and have to wait with
the church custodian until your Mom can pick you up.
87468: The scoutmaster waits while you search your things, but your permission
slip persists in its absence. Unfortunately, that means you have to stay behind
and miss the trip, since the troop can't wait for your mother to come up to the
church and sign your slip. You are put off the bus and have to wait with the
church custodian until your Mom can pick you up.
87716: The terrain outside the bus has changed, from flatland to the rugged
foothills of the Smoky Mountains. The scenery is breathtaking, but soon the sun
has set and all you can see outside the bus is blackness.
87860: After a 6-hour bus ride the Troop finally arrives at the State Park. You
spend a night in your tent with your buddy Ryan. It seems you hardly slept at
all when you hear Colin playing Reveille.
88092: You hurriedly get dressed and exit your tent. The smell of frying bacon
and eggs is heavenly.
88160: But since you forgot your mess kit, you cant eat! Fortunately, someone
DID bring an extra cup and lets you use it to get something to eat. But by this
time most of the food is gone. You gobble up the last of the eggs and a quick
cup of greasy milk (only greasy because you ate the eggs in the same cup...)
88376: You quickly get your mess kit, and get in line to eat! The chaplain's
aide gives a quick prayer, and then you dig in. Seems like nothing ever tasted
so good.
88824: ho made these caves his hideout. He went on to say that the thief, Jack
Pratchett, fled to these caves with a posse hot on his trail after having
robbed the Southern Payroll train. Wounded and alone, he made it into the
labyrinth of caves and the search parties never found him. The guide went on to
say that it was rumoured he died in the caves and his ghost still haunted the
caves, guarding his gold.
89104: A little disappointed, you take your place in the single-file line of
kids that will be touring through the cave. Oddly enough, you appear to be last
in the line. The tour guide warns you that the tour will be rapid, (he looks
rather bothered to be having to lead your group through the cave, and you
suspect he doesnt really  care to be leading you at all). 


 Halfway through
the tour, you stop to tie your shoes. When you stand up, you find that everyone
except Ryan has moved on. 'Stick with your buddy!' Ryan quotes from the Scout
handbook. 'Did you see which way the other guys went?' you ask him. 'Sure!' he
replies, leading you down a left branch. But after about 10 steps you come to a
place where a high East-West passage crosses over the path you are taking, and
another NE/SW passage goes down into darkness. There appear to be several paths
you can take, but you choose the wrong one, and soon become hopelessly lost. If
that werent enough, you slip on some wet limestone and fall through a crack
down a steep slope into pitch blackness. You crack your head on something very
hard and lose consciousness. 











You aren't out for long, you wake up
and look about you, but you see nothing but darkness.

You hear a low moan
beside you in the blackness.
90012: The clock chimes a quarter past the hour. Your heart skips a beat and
you realize you need to get moving.
90088: The clock strikes the half-hour. Your mother calls from the other room
that you need to hurry.
90156: The clock strikes again. Fifteen minutes before time to go.
90200: You must be anxious to get there. Your mother gets in the car with you.
In less than a minute you are on the road and on your way to a high-adventure
trip!
90336: the flashlight flickers one last time and goes out. You flick the switch
off and on but it's no use. You throw away the dead batteries.
90432: Quickly you replace them with the spare batteries you brought. The
flashlight is now on, and bright.
90636: Giving Ryan some Tylenol to kill his pain.
90784: This is the Hidden Items Room. You shouldn't be able to GET here.
90836: The huge bus barn dominates the background of the area. The spire of the
church rises to the sky in the distance, across the empty parking lot. But here
at the bus barn there is a flurry of activity as the Scouts prepare for a trip.
Your new friends are busily hauling tents, patrol boxes, tables, chairs, cook
stoves, and other equipment from the shed into the back of the bus. They have
formed a sort of fire brigade and are passing the equipment forward. The Adults
are supervising from the distance. The Troop Quartermaster, a Life Scout named
John, is busy in the shed tallying the equipment and directing what gear is to
go.
91280: The scoutmaster hovers nearby, busily talking with the other leaders.
91328: The scoutmaster is giving directions to the leader who will be driving
the bus.
91384: One of the moms is giving the scoutmaster a bag of medicine for her son.
91436: The scoutmaster looks to see how the bus loading is going.
91476: He says, "you KNOW I can't sign that! Why would you even ask me? A Scout
is Trustworthy. It's the FIRST part of the Scout Law."
91580: The scoutmaster looks at your permission slip. "Looks like your Mom
forgot to sign this," he says. "She's already left, but maybe we can call her
back." He gets on his cellphone and calls her. Your mom comes back up to the
church and signs the slip, telling you she's sorry she forgot. "You realize,"
says the scoutmaster, "that as a scout YOU should 'be prepared', so you should
have checked it yourself before coming up here."
91888: "Son, sorry you forgot that. If you can't get one, you can't go." The
scoutmaster sighs. "You really should be more careful. I'll just bet that if
you had asked your Mom she would have remembered it." He puts his hand on your
shoulder. "Tell you what I'll do. Let's call your Mom and see if we can't get
her to come back up here and sign a new one." 
He calls your Mom, and she comes
back up to the church with your signed permission slip.
92244: The scoutmaster looks at your permission slip. "Looks like your Mom
forgot to sign this," he says. "She's already left, but maybe we can call her
back." He gets on his cellphone and calls her. Your mom comes back up to the
church and signs the slip, telling you she's sorry she forgot. "You realize,"
says the scoutmaster, "that as a scout YOU should 'be prepared', so you should
have checked it yourself before coming up here."
92644: "I didn't understand what you're trying to tell me," says the
scoutmaster. "Is it really important?"
92720: The scoutmaster looks at your permission slip. "Looks like your Mom
forgot to sign this," he says. "She's already left, but maybe we can call her
back." He gets on his cellphone and calls her. Your mom comes back up to the
church and signs the slip, telling you she's sorry she forgot. "You realize,"
says the scoutmaster, "that as a scout YOU should 'be prepared', so you should
have checked it yourself before coming up here."
93028: A blond haired kid in the troop. Though young he has almost reached
Eagle, and a lot of the boys look up to him, because he seems older for his age
and knows a lot. He plays the bugle for the troop an is quite good.
93180: Colin sits in a seat in front of you.
93206: Colin is quietly reading a book nearby.
93306: Colin sings a camping song, for a bit, and some of the other scouts join
in.
93364: A fly buzzes near Colin. He ignores it.
93396: A fly lands on Colin's bugle. He thumps it away with a frown.
93442: Colin looks at Ryan and chuckles. 'Have you finished that Spyro gameboy
game you've been playing yet?' Ryan frowns at him. 'Not yet. I'm stuck on level
6.'
93712: Colin shuts his eyes for a moment and gets a little rest.
93760: ey, Ryan,' says Colin. 'Have you studied for Mrs. Young's Math test yet?
You KNOW it's coming up Monday.' He frowns. 'Don't know how we're going to get
time to study for it.'
94072: Colin drums his fingers on his backpack and looks out the bus window.
94122: Nearby, Colin and another scout discuss a recent Eagle Ceremony.
94172: Colin quietly munches on a sandwich.
94200: Colin glances at his glow-in-the-dark watch. 'This is some long trip,'
he gripes.
94262: Colin asks you a question, but the background noise of the bus and he
other scouts has drowned it out. You tap your ear to signify you didn't hear
him and he grins. 'It wasn't important, I was just asking if you were enjoying
the trip.'
94436: ure, I brought my flashlight. Didn't you?'
94470: "I'm not interested in your stuff. I've got enough to carry without
lugging YOUR stuff too.
94544: "Over my dead Body!!" shouts Colin. "Hey guys, this scout's trying to
steal my bugle!" Several of the older scouts come over and give you an ugly
look. "A Scout is Trustworthy," says one of them quiely. "How'd you like to go
through life in this troop with no one trusting you?"
94748: A shiny brass bugle.
94764: The inside of the bus seems pretty clean. Scouts are all around you in
the seats, talking or looking out the windows at the flatlands rolling by.
Every so often you can see a field of corn or rice in the scenery, but for the
most part the view outside is relatively uninteresting. Some of the boys are
opening their lunches and eating them.
95000: It's dark outside. The lights in the bus are off so that the bus driver
can see the road. Every so often a passing car lights up the road beside you.
Some of the boys are using their flashlights to read a book. One boy is playing
a game on his Gameboy, although that's not really allowed on the trip. At
least, not off the bus. You peer over his shoulder and see that it's Spyro.
Some of the kids are getting some rest.
95296: This is your kitchen. The smell of food still hangs in the air. There is
a refrigerator, stove, sink, all the amenities of home. To the West is your
Living Room. A Door to the South leads to your Back Yard. A door to the North
leads to the Laundry Room.
95484: This is the Laundry Room. A door to the South leads to the Kitchen.
95562: tereo, couch, and a floor rug. / To the East is your Kitchen. A Hallway
leads North. To the South is your / Bathroom. To the West is the Garage. A set
of stairs leads up.
95692: This is the old familiar Upstairs Hall. There are doors leading East,
North and South, and stairs leading down.
95912: There is a door to the West, leading into the Upstairs Hall.
95976: Do you REALLY want me to describe your stinky clothes!?
96132: This is your Parents' Bedroom. You KNOW you aren't supposed to be in
here. A Door to the South leads to the Upstairs Hall.
96228: This is your Bedroom. The place where you sleep. A door to the North
leads to the hall.
96296: This is the Downstairs Hall. There are doors to the North and East. An
archway to the South leads into the Living Room.
96384: Garage. Lots of tools hang on the wall, and Junk around the sides. In
here is your family car.
96452: A general-purpose sleeping bag, suitable for warm or chilly but NOT
freezing weather. Your family balked a little at the cost of a sub-zero rated
bag.
96560: This is the family car. Not a Limo, but it will get you to the Church on
time.
96620: Yeah, you WISH! Dad said you weren't going to drive until you were 21,
remember?
96684: Downstairs Bathroom. There is a mirror above the sink, and the usual
items in here.
96744: A Back Yard with swingset and playhouse. Scattered toys litter the yard.
96796: A front yard. There is a tree here in the middle of the front yard.
96844: You are now up a tree. You recognize it as a Red Oak tree that lives in
your/ front yard.
96908: It is a nice roomy backpack you remember leaving up your tree for some
strange reason.
97426: :30. Takes 4 hours to get there, so we'll be setting up camp in the
dark.
97826: In the event of an emergency I agree not to hold his troop or church
liable.
  Signed:...
97968: The outside of your fridge looks like a bulletin board. Stuck to its
outside are lots of pieces of paper.
98044: The outside of your fridge looks like a bulletin board. Stuck to its
outside are lots of pieces of paper.
98146: Underneath the list, you find the permission slip!
98188: Refrigerator Moving is a hobby you really shouldn't have, at least until
you have a Dolly and a LOT more muscles.
98272: It is a new 50-foot coil of rope your Dad bought for tying gear down in
the bed of the truck.
98340: Deftly you tie the rope to the stalagmite, using the taut-line hitch you
were taught at an earlier meeting. You make sure the rope is tied well, and
drop the running end down the cliff. This should enable you to climb down to
the river below.
98508: Your mess kit. Your mom cleaned it after your last campout.
98552: A battered flashlight with a switch on the side.
98588: Some fresh batteries.
98604: Beautiful wood-grain kitchen cabinet.
98632: This is a box of those 'Strike-Anywhere' Tall Kitchen matches.
98700: Try "Strike match" - after all, they are 'STRIKE Anywhere' Matches,
right?
98764: A bright flaming match.
98784: The lit match falls on the pink 'Tongue', fizzles, and goes out.
Somewhere in the distance you hear a soft voice that says 'Ow!'
98880: The lit match falls down into the deep chasm. Somehow it stays lit all
the way to the bottom, over 100 feet below. It gives off a tiny glow far down
there, like a miniature campfire. From out of the chasm below you hear a faint
raspy voice that says 'Yessssss, Preciousssss, It's a nice little fire, it
isssss. Wonder why fire issss falling from the sky?'
99136: The match drops down into the raging river and the flame is extinguished
in a tiny puff of smoke, while the little match body floats off down the river
rapidly. You idly wonder if perhaps the match would come shooting out of the
ground where someone would see it and wonder how it could have come from
underground.
99352: There is a Dryer here.
99468: It is a big comfy couch, with large fluffy cushions.
99508: Although it would be comfy, even in a cave, you decide not to carry the
Big Comfy Couch.
99572: Some spare batteries.
99588: This is your bed. Unmade and messy. Wonder if something could be hiding
in it. Although even if you searched it you might not find anything, as messy
as this bed is.
99704: A Scout Knife. Your parents bought it for you for your first camping
trip last month. You've never even opened it. Not that the scoutmaster would
appreciate you opening it without your Tote'N'Chip.
99848: Your dresser is bright Red, with Blue drawers, a testimony to the years
that you were 'into' Spiderman. In the bottom drawer is a set of Spiderman
comics, but you resist the temptation to dig through them right now.
100000: There is a Washing Machine here.
100024: A Waterproof First Aid kit, which miraculously made it through the
washer and dryer without damage.
100096: A Roll of sterile gauze bandages, suitable for binding wounds.
100142: working carefully, you wrap the sterile gauze around Ryan's bleeding
leg. The direct pressure of the bandage stops the bleeding almost immediately.
Ryan smiles up at you gratefully. 'Thanks, Buddy!' he grins. 'This is why the
buddy system works.'
100320: A bottle of Tylenol.
100336: You must think you are a genie. Sorry, you aren't blue enough to pass
the genie test.
100400: A quantity of Tylenol. Looks like there are
100432: A Scout Canteen your parents bought when you joined. Looks like there
are
100568: A clean change of clothes.
100588: A sack lunch your Mom made for you. A ham sandwich with mustard and a
bag of chips, 10 cookies, a can of soda in aluminum foil, and a napkin!
100692: The yummy lunch satisfied all the hunger you'd been feeling.
100736: Your mother is here, busily cleaning up the mess in the home.
100780: Your mother is here, looking for specks of dust and straightening up.
100828: She says, 'Oh, honey I'm sorry, guess I forgot to sign that for you.'
She whips out a pen and signs the Permission Slip and hands it back to you.
100936: She says, 'Oh, honey I'm sorry, guess I forgot to sign that for you.'
She whips out a pen and signs the Permission Slip and hands it back to you.
101044: She says, 'Oh, honey I'm sorry, guess I forgot to sign that for you.'
She whips out a pen and signs the Permission Slip and hands it back to you.
101152: "Honey, weren't you playing with that in the downstairs bath?"
101200: "I think I stuck that to the fridge with a magnet."
101240: "I think I stuck that to the fridge with a magnet."
101280: "Last time I saw you playing with THAT was about a week ago in the
tree..."
101340: "Well, your Father just bought that, but I don't think he'd mind if you
took it into that cave. After all, a Scout ought to Be Prepared."
101444: "We're keeping the camping gear in the garage now."
101484: You pick your Mom up briefly. "Honey, I know you're strong, but you
need to be packing for a trip." She tousles your hair as you put her back down.
101592: The cavern you are in is a large star-shaped cathedral. Light doesn't
quite reach to the far ends of the cavern, but you can see that passages lead
off in many directions. Dimly, high above you, you can see the crack you fell
through, now completely out of reach. To the South you can make out a tight
crawlspace. To the North the ceiling drops down to a low crawlspace. To the
East there is a high shelf you can just reach.
101892: Your friend Ryan has black tousled hair and light blue eyes. Very
intelligent but somewhat mischevious. He's a good friend and you've known him
for several years. He's the one that talked you into joining this troop.
102044: Ryan's leg is bleeding pretty badly. The gash is fairly deep. He is
groaning in pain and appears rather pale.
102124: Ryan seems like he will make it now, but he is grimacing in pain
because of the wound in his leg.
102192: Ryan seems to be back to his old tricks, though he's limping and has a
bandage on his leg.
102256: Your buddy, Ryan stands near you expectantly.
102292: Your buddy, Ryan lays on the ground groaning in pain. He is holding his
leg, which appears to be bleeding..
102372: Ryan stands nearby, leaning on the rock wall for support.
102412: Ryan scratches his nose and sighs.
102436: Ryan adjusts his glasses and rubs his chin thoughtfully.
102476: Ryan kicks a rock, then grabs his leg in pain. 'Man, I hope we get out
of here. This place is like a maze.'
102692: Ryan sniffs, then wipes his nose with a hanky.
102730: you got any suntan lotion? I wanna catch some rays.' Ryan grins in the
feeble light. 'Heh. If I could FIND some...'
102864: There is a cracking sound. You turn around and see Ryan cracking his
knuckles. 'Oops, Sorry,' he grins. 'It's not an earthquake.'
102966: hey,' says Ryan, 'look at this Stalactite. Does it look like a barber
pole to you too? - Or maybe I just need a haircut.'
103056: Ryan mumbles to himself. 'What'd you say?' you ask. 'I was wondering if
there was a coke machine in here anywhere,' Ryan grins.
103418: seems like we're going around in circles,' says Ryan. He breaks out his
compass and double-checks your sense of direction. 'Nope, guess not.'
103928: Ryan looks off in the distance and sighs contentedly.
104064: Ryan digs through his pack, pulls out a candy bar, and eats it
contentedly. He sees you looking at him and grins with a mouth full of
chocolate. 'Got Milk?'
104354: man, I forgot to study for my History test,' says Ryan. 'I hope Mr.
Grumpy grades on a curve this time.'
104668: A fly buzzes by Ryan while he munches on a miniature snickers. 'Mine!'
he gripes, then thumps at it to drive it away.
104754: have you seen 'The Incredibles' yet?' Ryan asks. 'That is just TOO
cool. Wish I could run across water like that kid Dash.'
104854: now why didn't I bring my hardhat?' says Ryan. You can bump your head
pretty bad in a cave.
105032: He says, "you KNOW I can't sign that! Why would you even ask me? A
Scout is Trustworthy. It's the FIRST part of the Scout Law."
105136: He says 'I can't take THIS. YOU need it.' He smiles. 'Besides, I've
already got one of my own.'
105216: He says 'I can't take THIS. YOU found it.' He smiles. 'I've got enough
to carry anyway on this bum leg. Of course, we can't KEEP it. It isn't ours,
and a Scout is Trustworthy. Wonder if there's a reward?'
105382: you take out a couple pills and give them to Ryan. He washes them down
with a swig from the canten you gave him, and hands the canteen back. 'Thanks,
Buddy!' he grins. 'This is why the buddy system works.'
105580: Ryan is not really in any condition to bind his own leg. Working
carefully, you wrap the sterile gauze around Ryan's bleeding leg. The direct
pressure of the bandage stops the bleeding almost immediately. Ryan smiles up
at you gratefully. 'Thanks, Buddy!' he grins. 'This is why the buddy system
works.'
105860: "Looks like MY flashlight was broken in the fall." says Ryan.
105908: "Sure hope YOUR flashlight lasts!"
105940: "I hope you have something that will give us some light!"
106374: looks like your slip's signed, so you're ok. You KNOW I made sure MINE
was signed.'
106442: this doesn't look like it's signed.' Ryan sighs. 'I dunno if the
scoutmaster will let you go if it's not signed. He doesn't want you to get hurt
and not get help. You know, doctors won't fix your broken leg if that's not
signed, until your Mom can come to the hospital.'
106746: of course I didn't bring a rope. It wasn't on the list.'
106832: 'I once saw a Disney show where a bunch of dwarves used those to dig
diamonds in a mine. Wonder if there are any diamonds around here?' He smiles.
'Just kidding. Guess you could use that to dig, if you knew where.'
106990: man, it just crumbled to rust. Glad they don't make em like they used
to.'
107076: Ryan groans. 'Very funny, evil genius. Of course my permission slip was
signed. Besides, if this isn't an emergency I'll let you know when one comes
up.'
107238: it really really really hurts. Please help me. Can you stop the
bleeding?'
107330: hey, I'm ok. Let's just think about getting outta here.'
107376: He says 'I can't take THIS. YOU need it.' He smiles. 'Besides, I've
already got one of my own.'
107456: He says 'I can't take THIS. YOU found it.' He smiles. 'I've got enough
to carry anyway on this bum leg. Of course, we can't KEEP it. It isn't ours,
and a Scout is Trustworthy. Wonder if there's a reward?'
107622: you take out a couple pills and give them to Ryan. He washes them down
with a swig from the canteen you gave him, and hands the canteen back. 'Thanks,
Buddy!' he grins. 'This is why the buddy system works.'
107774: you take out a couple pills and give them to Ryan. He finally washes
them down with a scoopful of water from the river.
108252: This shelf is about 6 feet above the floor of the Star Chamber. The
shelf is much deeper than it appears from the floor. To the East is a narrow
cave.
108360: This tight crawlspace runs north and south. Above you is a shelf you
can climb onto.
108420: You are standing on a very narrow shelf. Below you, you can dimly make
out the floor of a tight crawlway, about 5 feet down. On the wall in front of
you someone wrote 'Jack was here 1910' That was almost 100 years ago.
108580: You are in a very low crawlspace that you can make it through on your
hands and knees. To the South it widens out into a vast chamber. To the North
it twists around a bend and widens. To the West is a crack seems to lead down
into inky blackness.
108752: This cave has a dry stream bed running through it. The stream bed runs
Eas-West. To the East the stream bed cascades down into darkness. To the West
the stream came through a hole much too small to crawl through.
108904: After crawling and sliding down a rather narrow hole you find yourself
looking out into a raging river, almost 30 feet below you. Directly across from
you, and about 5 feet away, is another hole leading East. Unfortunately it is
too far to reach, and you are too close to the ceiling to stand up and jump.
109198: with a great effort you manage to land the far side on the shelf. The
plank spans the river now, and you can cross carefully on your hands and knees.
109304: You scramble carefully across the teetering plank.
109340: You scramble carefully across the teetering plank.
109376: This passage bends upwards steeply, and is rather low, so that you have
to scramble up it carefully. To the West a narrow plank crosses a raging river,
while East and Up the passage leads out of sight.
109520: The Scramble leads out onto a strange rock formation sticking out into
a great dark chasm. The bottom is lost in darkness. The rock formation
resembles nothing so much as a pink tongue. It is formed from limestone pouring
over the edge of the chasm for centuries. Across the chasm, about 20 feet away,
you can just make out a Point of rock sticking into this chasm.
109776: This shelf is hidden from view by anyone standing on the tongue
formation below, though anyone standing on the Tongue could turn around, reach
up, and scramble up to it. It leads up and North along the chasm.
109924: Here the shelf approaches the ceiling of the cavern, and therefore you
have to bend over to proced. Just when it seems like you cannot proceed any
further you see the metal feet of a permanent ladder leading up a hole in the
ceiling.
110084: You are on a tall ladder leading up and down through a vertical hole in
pitch blackness. Above you, you can see a dim light. Below you the ladder ends
in a low shelf.
110200: At the top of the ladder you run right into a search party that was out
looking for YOU. When you didn't show up at the end of the tour with everyone
else, they immediately began searching for you by going back through the path
of the tour. The party you just ran into was the first 'deep foray' into the
heart of the mountain. 



 They are astonished by your tale of finding Jack
Pratchett's hideout.
110484: The cave is completely covered on the floor with large stagmites, and
on the ceiling by large stalactites. It resembles a giant mouth full of shark's
teeth. To the West, the cave opens onto a shelf. To the East the cave abruptly
ends at a cliff. Your feeble light cannot reach the far end of the cavern, but
it can dimly reveal a stream 50 feet below. One of the stalagmites on the floor
appears strong enough to support your weight.
110788: It's much too far to jump. You would only kill yourself
110852: This is a strong Stalagmite. You might be able to tie a rope around it
and it would probably hold your weight.
111088: in. The river is too wide to cross, and far too swift and cold for you
to risk swimming. High above you is an opening that looks very much like a
shark's open mouth.
111204: A river runs through this narrow chamber. Here the river runs through
and around several large boulders. The tops of the boulders are dry, and you
could easily jump from one to another and make your way East across the river.
A dark hole in the West wall looks large enough to walk through, and there is
enough room on either side of the river to proced North.
111456: This small chamber appears to have been dug out of the living rock by
human hands using a pickaxe.
111524: A prospector must have left this rusty pickaxe in the cave. It still
seems capable of diging, though.
111596: Using the pickaxe, you dig at the rockslide and gradually you clear a
passage to the West. By the time you cleared enough rock to get through,
however, the pickaxe, which was probably much older than YOU, crumbled into a
rusty pile.
111760: A river runs through this narrow chamber. This is the East Bank of the
river. There are boulders in the river that offer a way West across the river.
You can proceed North along the bank of the river.
111904: A river runs through this large chamber. This is the East Bank of the
river. High on the East wall is a thin crevice you might be able to squeeze
through.
112016: The crack is far too thin for you to squeeze through with all the stuff
you have.
112072: By turning sideways you find that you can squeeze through the crack.
Good thing you didn't put on too much weight over Christmas!. On the far side,
the crack opens up onto a narrow ledge above a cavern so deep your light cannot
show the bottom.
112244: This is a narrow ledge barely 6 inches wide, above a great cavern. You
have no idea how deep the cavern is. The narrow ledge leads up to the North at
a rather steep angle. It seems to proceed into a crack in the roof of the
cavern.
112408: After the narrow ledge entered the roof of the Big Cavern, the passage
became more of a low crawlspace and you have to proceed on hands and knees.
This finally opens out onto a small point, a little shelf hanging out into
blackness. The far side of this cavern is about twenty feet away. From this
vantage point you can see, directly across from you, an opening that looks like
a mouth with a pink tongue sticking out. The tongue is caused by limestone
pouring over the edge of the cliff into nothingness. Above the tongue there is
a shelf someone could climb to, if they knew it was there. The shelf leads
North and Up into blackness. From this side of the cavern, however, there is
nowhere to go but back the way you came.
112912: This small cave appears to have had a rock slide at the west end of it.
The rocks appear to be a little too large to move. If you had something with
which to break rocks, you could probably clear a path to move further west. To
the East and along the ceiling is a wide crack you can climb up to and crawl
through.
113128: This small cave appears to have had a rock slide at the west end of it.
Much of the rubble has been cleared away, and a small passage leads west into
darkness. To the East and along the ceiling is a wide crack you can climb up to
and crawl through.
113336: You crawl through the hole you have made in the rockslide.
113376: A large pile of rocks blocking passage west.
113408: Using the pickaxe, you dig at the rockslide and gradually you clear a
passage to the West. By the time you cleared enough rock to get through,
however, the pickaxe, which was probably much older than YOU, crumbled into a
rusty pile.
113572: Using the pickaxe, you dig at the rockslide and gradually you clear a
passage to the West. By the time you cleared enough rock to get through,
however, the pickaxe, which was probably much older than YOU, crumbled into a
rusty pile.
113736: This dusty, small cavern appears to have once been a hideout for
robbers. Several barrels line the walls, their contents long since turned to
powder. On the east side of the chamber is a small rock slide once blocked
passage in that direction. On the West side of the chamber, a much larger rock
slide appears to have caught Jack Pratchett much better than the posse that
pursued him into these caves. For here, you can see his skeletal remains pinned
under the avalanche. His head and shoulders extend out from under the pile of
large rocks, one skeletal arm outstretched for a large bag of gold coins just
outside the reach of his hand. Even in death it appears that Jack's lust for
gold was too much for him.
114228: Across a couple of the barrels rests a sturdy plank, which appears to
have been used in years past as a table.
114304: These Gold coins are priceless. You cannot even guess as to what the
heavy bag of coins is worth. The dates on the coins appear to vary between 1810
and 1855. Each coin is probably worth $10,000.
114452: This Six-Foot Sturdy Plank is over 100 years old, but the dry air of
the sealed hideout has preserved it very well.
114614: with a great effort you manage to land the far side on the shelf. The
plank spans the river now, and you can cross carefully on your hands and knees.
114718: Here are some AMUSING things to try while playing the game: 

Try
asking people about things, especially while you carry them. 
Try GETting
certain objects that aren't possible to get. 
Try asking Ryan about his
permission slip in the cave. 
Try taking Colin's bugle. 
Try examining each
object - some of them have amusing descriptions. 
Try dropping lit matches down
chasms, and on the tongue. 
Try brushing the Sharks Teeth in the Sharks Teeth
room.
115054: You've been excited about THIS trip for more than a month! Your troop
is going on a caving expedition to Cumberland Caverns! You've just finished
your homework for the weekend, and are all ready to pack for the trip. Being a
newbie to the caving scene, you are glad that the troop provided a packing list
for you. However, during the week you lost the list somewhere. So you'll either
have to find the list or pack what you can remember from memory. 


Your mom
comes into your bedroom and reminds you that you only have an hour before you
have to leave, so you'd better pack quickly.
