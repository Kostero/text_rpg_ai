87936: An elevator; pretty much like any other elevator you've ever been in.
Your increased weight conveys the sensation of movement and the floor indicator
above the closed doors changes as the elevator passes floors. Next to the
elevator doors, several dozen buttons are arranged in two rows.

All the walls
in this elevator are mirrored and exhibit a matrix of identical vampires and
gorgons stretching to infinity in all directions.
88232: The elevator door is closed.
88326: Butterflies momentarily flutter around in your stomach as the elevator
slows to a stop and the doors open. Beyond is the party with dozens of people
dressed in creative costumes.
88452: You can't open the elevator door in the conventional manner. It'll open
itself when you reach floor number
88672: has already been selected. Selecting anymore floors would delay arrival
at the party.
88732: The mirrors on each of the four walls cast infinite reflections. Endless
lines of Draculas and Medusas can be seen stretching to the vanishing point in
all.
88918: A dozen or so thin rubber snakes, painted red to blend almost
unnoticeably with her long curls, bounce around her head and face as she moves.
Her blue eyes glint in the dim lighting of the elevator.
89102: Her reflections surround you in all directions.
89136: There is a brief moment of uncomfortable silence.
89172: The girl turns to the mirror for a moment and arranges her snakes.
89220: The girl gives a barely audible sigh and brushes some previously
unnoticed lent off of her toga.
89288: With a faint glimmer of boredom, the girl seems to develop an intense
interest in some invisible, far away object well beyond the walls of this
elevator.
89480: Beautiful, with tiny scarlet serpents intertwined in the long, red,
curled locks.
89544: Rubber, dyed red to match the girl's hair color. The tiny snakes curl
about, interwoven with her natural curls. The affect is really quite stunning.
89656: Just you, all dressed up in the Dracula costume your brother helped to
make.
89712: Rubber, dyed red to match the girl's hair color. The tiny snakes curl
about, interwoven with her natural curls. The affect is really quite stunning.
89944: Conversation: Theory and Implementation with the ORLibrary" which can be
found at the following URL:
90066: If you are a developer looking into the ORLibrary, the article should be
well worth the time it takes to read.  And the source code... Well, there is no
better example than an example. You can download it from:
90494: The latest revision of the ORLibrary can be found at:
91308: The entire game can be played via this menu system, or it can be turned
off in favor of explicit ASK/TELL commands.
91392: For convenience, the normal ASK command can be abbreviated as the letter
A.  In addition, the character to which you are referring can also be presumed
so that commands such as:

     ASK GIRL ABOUT COSTUME

can be abbreviated
as:

     A COSTUME
91800: Conversations," each character in the game has a pool of potential
conversation topics that can be discussed.  For the player character, these are
normally displayed in the conversation menu; however a topic from this pool can
also be selected at random with the TALK command which is issued in the
following format:

     TALK TO GIRL.
92054: Speak command (or AMS for short) can be used to turn the automatic
conversation menu on or off with the following syntax:

     AMS ON

Or

    
AMS OFF

By default it is turned ON.
93218: D. 

In addition, he wrote the game, "Got Toast?" for Mark Musante's
"Toaster Comp".
93306: What does she do?
93320: "My mother's the president of Securities Bank and Trust over in
Milhelm."

I used to live in Milhelm. I know where that bank is.
93420: My mother's the president of...
93444: So what other 'Great women' are in that 'long line' you come from?
93494: "My grandmother makes the best blackberry cobbler on the planet."

She
smiled at that.  "That's certainly great if you like blackberry cobbler."
93604: My grandmother makes the best...
93628: "My sister is a neural surgeon."

"Wow! Very impressive."

You nod.
"Except that its carries more weight when she tells me I'm messed up in the
head."
93744: My sister is a neural surgeon.
93766: "I took theater for a couple of semesters and also remember Dr. Davidson
being particularly budget conscious."
93848: I took theater...
93862: "You were in theater?" She pauses as though having difficulty believing
that. "I've seen you around campus a few times; never would have pegged you for
an actor. Play in anything traditional, or are you a full time vampire?"
94026: "I played Macbeth."

"You're kidding. Macbeth?"

You nod and dig deep
into your memories for a quote. "Had I but died an hour before this chance, I
had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant, There's nothing serious in
mortality." You strike a melodramatic pose for a moment, then smile at her,
baring your fangs.

She bursts out laughing.
94288: I played Macbeth.
94302: "So you want to be an actor?"

You shake your head at this.
94350: "I only took theater as an elective. I'll be transferring to Harvard Law
after next year."

"A lawyer! You're taking this bloodsucking theme a little
far aren't you?"

"Hey, not all lawyers are bad!"

"Okay." She rolls her eyes,
unconvinced.
94540: I only took theater as an elective.
94566: "My aunt is an accountant. You remind me of her actually."

"I'm not
sure how to take that," she replies with a queer look upon her face.

"Take it
well," you say.  "She's a great woman. In fact, I come from a long line of
great women."
94748: My aunt is an accountant.
94766: "Dracula was always my favorite monster," you say, glancing at one of
your many reflections.
94836: Dracula was always my favorite...
94862: "So you chose Dracula," she arches her eyebrows and gives a look of
ridicule.  "Any significance to that?"
95008: You watch her eyes look over your costume as though assessing your
skills.
95464: "'You can stand back up if you happen to fall, but forget your lines and
make fools of us all.'  Yes, I think he makes them up himself.  We used to
cringe when someone would mess up on their lines in rehearsal, knowing that it
was coming."

"Sounds like he considers himself a poet."

"He's no Robert
Frost."
95692: "So you're a Frost fan?"
95776: Road Not Taken' stands out most in my memories."
95816: My mother used to read Frost to me...
95844: "Mummies always scared me."

A look of mock concern comes across her
face. "That's sad," she says. "It's okay to be scared of monsters, but no child
should be scared of mommies."

You start to shake your head at her
misunderstanding but see her smile and realize she was joking.
96048: Mummies scared me...
96064: "So what other things scare you?" she asks.
96096: "As a child, I was scared to death of Grover."

"Grover?  You mean from
Sesame Street?"

"Yes," you say, nodding. "He used to give me nightmares."

She
chuckles from that.  "I think he sounds like Yoda."
96260: Grover scared me...
96338: "Being trapped in an elevator with Medusa," you answer.

"What, with
those fangs?"

"Fangs won't do me any good if I'm a statue."

"Well if you turn
to stone I'll give you a nice home in my garden," she says. "You can scare away
the birds."
96524: "I always liked Flash Gordon."

"That's a little before my time," she
responds with a smirk.

"Not the original," you laugh.  "They remade it into
new movie some time back."

"A few decades ago," she says.

"Well... yeah, I
guess." you admit grudgingly.

She nods, "I repeat, that's a little before my
time."
96768: I always liked Flash Gordon...
96792: "So I bet you're a meat-eater, huh?"
96822: "I could never be a vegetarian.  Nothing is better than a juicy, tender
steak." You say.

She cringes. "I just can't eat anything that once had a
face."

"Chocolate bunnies have faces."

She laughs at this. "Okay, chocolate
bunnies are the exception to the rule."
97024: I could never be a vegetarian...
97048: "I have a cousin who grows a flower garden for a living," you say.

"For
a living?"

"Uh-hmm.  He has a big green house and supplies flower shops around
his town with their inventory."

"Hmmm," she thinks for a moment, then: "I
never really thought about where floral shops get what they sell.  Flowers
don't live very long."
97288: I have a cousin who grows a flower garden...
97320: "You don't agree with our position?" she asks, knowing the answer
already from your expression.
97388: "I'm actually a firm believer in capitol punishment," you say.

She
seems disappointed to hear you say this and responds, as though reading from a
well-rehearsed script: "Murdering another person won't change what they
did."

"It isn't murder, its justice," you respond.  "And the mindset of a
murderer is cancerous.  Cutting it out of society is the only way to ensure it
doesn't grow."

She reacts visibly to this, actually turning to face you. "You
can remove it from society without..."  Then she stops, closes her eyes and
turns back to the door.  She takes a deep breath and exhales.  Then she opens
her eyes.  "Let's just agree to disagree," she says.

You remain agreeably
silent.

For a moment there is an uncomfortable pause.  Then she looks at you
with a glint in her eye and serious expression on her face.  "It's good that
you care one way or the other.  Apathy kills a person from the inside out, so
it's good to have strong opinions."

You stand for a moment listening to her,
conscious that there seems to be an invisible wall of separation between you
now.  Then she speaks again with that sly smile on her face. "Even though
you're wrong," she says.  And suddenly the wall is gone.
98248: I'm a firm believer in capitol punishment...
98282: "I like your costume," You say, conscious of how lame you sound.
98336: I like your costume.
98352: The girl smiles at you. "I've always been fascinated with Greek
mythology." She glances at her reflection in the mirror. "My room mate helped
me make this.  She's a theatrical major and gets a lot of experience working
with costumes.  I understand her professor is a little on the cheap side so
they often just have to make do."

That rings true to your ears, having taken
some creative arts classes before.
98642: "What's the root of this aversion to lawyers, you seem to have?"
98692: Why do you dislike lawyers?
98712: "I dated a lawyer for a while." She shrugs her shoulders. "He argued
with me about everything.  I don't think he cared which side of an argument he
was on, just as long as we disagreed. It was frustrating."

"I refer you to my
previous statement: 'Not all lawyers are bad.'"

"I'm sorry, but are you
arguing with me?" she asks with a smirk on her face.
98972: "What about you? What do you want to be when you grow up?" You ask
jovially.

"An astronaut," she answers.

You start to chuckle but stop when you
see her straight face.

"Really?"

She smiles. "No."
99128: What about you? What do you...
99152: "I've been majoring in accounting. I was thinking that would be a good
fall back career in case my space faring ambitions don't pan out." Hmmm. You
like her dry humor. It reminds you of your aunt who, incidentally is also an
accountant.
99322: "You want to be an accountant? Math has just never been my thing."

She
nods.
99384: You want to be an accountant?
99406: "I want to be a CPA.  I've been fascinated with numbers most of my life.
I think I find comfort in the clear-cut, logical rules."
99506: "Milhelm is an expensive area of town. Your family must live pretty
comfortably."
99568: Milhelm is an expensive area...
99592: "We do okay. My father's a workaholic."
99624: "What does he do?  Your father, I mean."
99660: What does your father do?
99678: "I'm not all that sure to be honest.  Something with computers, I
think."

You nod. "I hear some people think those things have potential."

She
giggles.
99798: "I used to stay up late at night and watch vampire shows with my father
when I was a little girl.  At least I did when he wasn't working."

You
grimace. "Not exactly Sesame Street."

She shrugs.  "It's true.  I was too
young to be watching those kinds of shows.  Vampires scare me even today."
100020: "So what do you think about vampires?" you ask.
100056: So you're a Star Wars fan?
100078: She smiles. "I love Star Wars... And Star Trek."

"I'm surprised.  You
don't look like a 'Treky,'" you say.

"Well, I draw the line at going to
conventions, but yes.  I tend to like Science Fiction as a whole."
100248: So you're a Star Wars fan?
100270: "My favorite was Buck Rogers in the 24th and a half century," she says
with a sly look on her face.

You're beginning to catch on to her joking
personality now, but decide to take the bait anyway: "I think that was 'Duck
Dodgers' from a bugs bunny cartoon."

"Oh," she responds dismissively.  "I
hadn't realized."

"Yeah, I bet," you say, smiling.
100536: "So where exactly is this garden you need a stone scarecrow for?"
100584: "I keep my garden in the back of our sorority house."
100624: So where is this garden?
100644: "Do you grow a flower garden, or a vegetable garden?"
100768: Also, I'm a vegetarian so it comes in handy."
100804: Is it a flower or vegetable garden?
100832: "What sorority are you in?"
100854: "I'm in the Chi Lambda sorority," the girls says.

"Oh yes," you say
recalling an event last summer. "You held that protest against the
death-penalty last year."

She smiles at the recognition and nods.  "Yes, it
was fairly successful I think.  It definitely heightened public
awareness."

You suddenly feel a little warm. "I suppose," you say and suddenly
gain an intense interest in the floor indicator.
101156: What sorority are you in?
101176: "So," you begin with a smile. "You seem to have quite the affinity for
snakes."
101308: "Your interest in Greek mythology led you to a medusa costume," you
comment.
101452: "And what does all of her work get her? Decapitation by 'the man'." She
shakes her head in mock sorrow.
101528: "What does your mother do?" you ask, looking to find more about this
enchanting girl's roots.
101596: "She's a homemaker," is her matter-a-fact response.
101636: "Your roommate sounds like she seriously into theatrics."
101678: "I like to think of her as a 'drama queen.'" she responds.

You smile
at this.
101740: "Well," says the girl.  "It was nice to meet you."  With that she turns
and steps off of the elevator. 

You watch her blend into the party, mildly
disappointed to see her walk away, then shrug it off.
101900: If you could just keep a girl confined in a one-room conversation all
the time, there wouldn't be much use for a party, now would there?
101998: It took you a little time to get your vampire costume together, so
you've been running late for Gary's costume party.  You've arrived now on the
ground floor of his high-rise apartment building.  Better late than never as
they say.  

The elevator makes a soft jingle as it opens and you step into the
mirrored interior.  For a moment you think, struggling to remember Gary's floor
number...  Oh yes, you remember now,
102304: .  You reach out and push the appropriate button.  The doors begin to
close but stop suddenly as a slender hand appears.  There's another jingle and
the doors open again revealing a beautiful, red-headed girl dressed in a toga. 


You recognize her from campus although you do not actually know her.  For a
moment you almost do not see the red rubber snakes entwined with her long red
curls.  She steps into the elevator and reaches for a button, but stops,
apparently seeing that it is already lit.
102708: that this "Medusa" is going to same costume party that you are.
102964: The Menu-Speak conversation system is already turned off.
103008: The Menu-Speak conversation system is now turned off.
103048: The Menu-Speak conversation system is already turned on.
103092: The Menu-Speak conversation system is now turned on.
103132: There are no conversation topics currently in the menu system.
104128: "I don't know anything about that,"
104244: You'll need to be more specific. Who
104296: You'll need to be more specific. Who
104348: You'll need to be more specific. Who
104400: You'll need to be more specific. Who
104434: This game employs the Ask/Tell model for conversation. It should be
noted, however, that slight improvements have been made to the system
traditionally employed. Of particular noteworthiness is the attempt to
determine the person that is being addressed if unspecified. For example, the
command:
104794: ave been implemented for "Ask" and "Tell" respectively, so the above
example could also be worded as:
104870: The "Talk" command has been implemented. Be forewarned, that unlike
other games, where "Talk" is the sole method of conversing, this command is
meant to augment the Ask/Tell paradigm.  This command is not guaranteed to
further a script. "Talk" simply chooses a random topic from the player's
running pool of potential subjects. It can nevertheless be useful when you are
uncertain what to say:
