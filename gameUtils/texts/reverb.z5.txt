19018: The game file has verified as intact.
19050: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupted (unless you

perform the test).

22845: But it's dark.
22936: You find nothing of interest.
24106: . Not bad.
24124: That was a rhetorical question.
24151: This dangerous act would achieve little.
24185: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
24221: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
24258: That seems unnecessary.
24281: Keep your mind on the game.
24306: What a good idea.
24325: You smell nothing unexpected.
24352: You hear nothing unexpected.
24377: You taste nothing unexpected.

24437: You feel nothing unexpected.
24462: If you think that'll help.
24488: Digging would achieve nothing here.
24555: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
24588: You would achieve nothing by this.
24617: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
24650: But there's no water here to carry.
24681: Oh, don't apologise.
24703: Real adventurers do not use such language.
24738: Quite.
24749: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
24782: There's not enough water to swim in.
24813: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
24877: You achieve nothing by this.
24965: You wave, feeling foolish.
25115: You are unable to.
25134: Nothing obvious happens.
25157: That would be less than courteous.
25195: Is that the best you can think of?
25224: That's not a direction.
25247: Not that way you can't.
25279: Keep your hands to yourself.
25304: You achieve nothing by this.
25338: Futile.
25350: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
25402: You talk to yourself a while.
25429: This provokes no reaction.
25457: There is no reply.
25476: Nothing is on sale.
25495: Your singing is abominable.
25521: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
25558: Time passes.
25573: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
39396: You're a pancake!
39547: Okay, let's recap the story so far. Your afternoon got off to an
interesting start when you foiled an escape attempt by Guido "The Armadillo"
Calzone. This heroic-but-not-terribly-bright action brought down the wrath of
the local mafia down on you, who tried to assassinate you inside a department
store. They also left a "special delivery" for you which started an earthquake.
You were also responsible for uncovering the illicit activities of the corrupt
mayor, who then sent every cop and trooper in the area to take care of you. So,
you're hounded by the police, wanted dead by the mob, and trying to cope with a
massive earthquake.

As you step outside, you can see that the people of the
town have succumbed to the general chaos of the environment, and now the town
of San Doppleton is marred by heavy rioting.
40129: A security guard steps out of the building after you. He stations
himself in front of the office building, arms folded.
40257: Things aren't that bad. Yet.
40286: You're a lover, not a fighter. Then again, you're not much of a lover
either.
40352: Got to learn to curb those violent tendencies.
40391: What did that ever do to you?
40544: Oh, help, police, somebody stop him.
40582: You're not holding that.
40611: You swing for a while. Guess that makes you a real hep cat.
40654: You can't swing on that.
40683: Taken.

You are now holding yourself. In the self you see yourself,
which contains yourself. Yourself contains...

On second thought, let's NOT do
that.
40806: Not in this game, bro. You must be looking for the sequel,
"Reverberating Goddesses of Phobos".
40883: Same to you, dude, and so's your mom.
40924: I thought you'd like it.
40960: Good memory.
40976: Well, hurry up and get your act together. This is no time to screw
around.
41036: Forget it. You may be a dork, but at least you're a chivalrous dork.
41092: Well, I've got news for you, Donatello. The sewer vent it just too small
for you to fit inside.
41168: Well then, you'd better wait for the author to finish writing "Wronger
of Rights."
41229: Nobody asked you anything, doofus.
41270: Robert "Tasty" Tasker would kill you if heard you insulting his
stationery.
41329: Smart boy.
41342: Well, now I'm reminding you.
41370: Okay, if it makes you feel better to think so.
41409: I sure hope not!
41427: That's right, you're not. Now focus on the job at hand... it's pizza
time, dude!
41494: Your mommy would be so proud.
41517: Nobody asked you anything, doofus.
50310: You jump off the floor. The Russian judge almost gives you a 9.0, but
you screw up on the landing and collapse in a heap.
50470: You're not holding onto anything important anyway.
50583: That doesn't seem to have a nozzle.
50643: a good lob and it lands on the ground a couple of feet away. It's a good
thing you're so good at surfing, because you'll never be a football star.
50761: What are you talking about?
50786: Excuse me for not paying attention... I must have missed the part when
you tied it to something.
50858: You remember hearing that word from some little grom on the beach last
year. You have no idea what it means, but it sounds way cool.
50954: Yah, same to you. Whaddup?
50978: I agree, this sucks.
51018: A hollow voice in your head says "Penis", a little bit louder than you
did.
51074: This really isn't that kind of game.
51102: Shake, rattle, and roll!
51176: I can't believe you don't know what THAT means.
51233: axm

Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another
dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally
been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the
soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new
orifice.

Anyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's
only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go
home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new "Surfers Monthly"
magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.

Shyeah, right. That's what YOU
think.
51734: You see a woman hail a taxi and drive off.
51772: Two men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their
separate ways.
51836: A man and a woman walk by holding hands. They make a cute couple.
51890: Two teenaged girls go by carrying shopping bags.
51932: A guy in a business suit walks past you.
51968: A big ugly low rider cruises by, blaring rap music loud enough to make
the sidewalk shake.
52058: Some guy in a dark suit with a very obvious bulge in the pocket walks
by. You turn your face, trying not to be recognized.
52169: A police car drives by. You press yourself against a wall until it goes
by.
52239: You hear somebody yell "Hold it right there!!!"  Seeing a uniformed
police officer, you panic for a moment... then breathe a sigh of relief as he
rushes past you and arrests a rioter.
52398: Yelling wildly, several rioters rush out of Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor
carrying a big pepperoni. You think about stopping them, but then decide you
value your life more than this job.
52541: A rioter throws a rock at the mayor's window. The rock bounces to the
ground, barely missing you. Those windows are pretty durable.
52708: The building you are in shakes ominously under the force of the
earthquake. You lean up against a wall until it subsides.
52801: The fronds wave at you in unison.
52843: The ground trembles under your feet. It feels like an earthquake might
be in progress.
52916: You lurch for a moment as the ground makes loud rumbling noises. Sounds
like an earthquake is about to hit. A bad one.
53056: Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor", where you are currently working. Not much of
a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year
when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the
parlor is southwest.

There is something pressing that you think you have to
do, but you can't think what it might be.
53325: Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor". To the southwest is the rest of the
restaurant.
53396: You walk around to the front of the pizza parlor.
53466: Tasty's Pizza Parlor". The counter separating you from the back of the
parlor stretches in front of you on the northeast corner of the room. To the
south is an exit to the street.
53603: yhn

Annoyingly, you can't shake this feeling that you're forgetting to
do something important. Your glance strays idly towards the counter in the
middle of the room...
53746: You walk behind the counter.
53817: As you step towards the door, there is a massive explosion. It seems to
have come from
53950: lxmthe bomb which you so carelessly left behind. I guess there's a
proximity trigger on that thing.
54021: Too bad. It looks like exposing crime doesn't pay.
54066: It's a majorly boring counter which you're unfortunately very familiar
with.
54469: Mr. Tasty's" stationery with the name Bob "Tasty" Tasker and lots of
balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute?
54658: It's already open!
54736: They don't get more closed than this.
54768: You close the pizza box.
54808: The grease on the box is tempting, but experience shows that cardboard
is indigestible.
54895: You'd be out of a job in no time for eating a customer's pizza. In the
interest of letting you scrape out a living, I'll assume that you changed your
mind before it was too late.
55063: My, aren't you persistent. You don't REALLY want to jeopardize your
career (lame and pathetic though it is) just to satisfy some momentary hunger
pangs, do you?
55182: Your startling discovery has driven all thoughts of food right out of
your mind.
55263: Digging through layers of cheese, you discover and confiscate a metal
file.
55316: You don't find anything new.
55344: Yeah, good idea. Why don't you just take the whole pizza out of the box
and carry it around in your hands and see how big a mess you can make. NOT.
55466: It's a long, hard metal file, the kind that you see in prison escape
movies all the time.
55711: How cheesy can you get?"
55752: Okay, fine. You grab a slice of pizza and take a big bite out of
it.

OUCH!  Your teeth clamp down on something hard and metallic. You drop the
slice and look under a layer of cheese. Inside you discover a metal file, which
you take.
55934: San Doppleton is where you live, work and play -- at least until summer.
It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's
just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't
complain much.
56113: You stand in the heart of San Doppleton's main drag, the business
district. The street goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a pizza parlor,
with a sewer vent nearby.
56259: As you start to walk away, the bomb explodes!
56342: What do you think you are, a Ninja Turtle?
56430: containing the bomb into the sewer duct. Moments later, you breathe a
sigh of relief as you hear a quiet splash. No doubt you've saved yourself and
the city from certain destruction.

An absolutely massive explosion rocks the
ground beneath your feet. Buildings tremble all around you and the pavement
lurches sickeningly. After a moment the shockwaves die down, but you still feel
an occasional tremor. Seems like you might have triggered some sort of
geological disaster.
56775: into the sewer duct, where it is washed away and lost forever. Bet you
feel pretty stupid now.
56858: They're the people that you meet, when you're walking down the street,
each day. They're completely uninteresting.
56946: They're just those normal, nameless dudes and chicks that you meet every
day, here in the city. Nothing noteworthy.
57034: Normal passersby, the kind you see all the time and usually ignore. You
can't think of any reason to change that habit now.
57131: You see a cop standing there and decide not to risk it.
57183: Approaching the edge of town, you suddenly shy away. You're SURE there
was something you were supposed to do before going home today. What was it
again?...
57298: You shouldn't leaving town until you deliver that pizza. It would cost
you your job, and we all know how important THAT is to you.
57617: an excellent psychological reason why your character may not go in that
direction. Well, technically you are on a mission from the District Attorney.
But that doesn't seem to be a good enough reason, since you're a paranoid
little guy and you'd rather go home anyway. Besides, this is a very short game
by design and I JUST DON'T HAVE THE TIME to make up sensible rationales for
you, other than that there's no game that way and if you left then I'd have to
give you a "game over" message, which is clearly impolite.

So here's your
reason. Gigantic, rabid gerbils are blocking your way out of town. And you
can't go that way.
58079: Why don't you just go inside instead of fooling around with it?
58175: You didn't buy the hairspray!
58212: If you leave the store with the hairspray, that would be shoplifting.
You don't want to start a life of crime, do you?
58309: The clerk seems to have been knocked out and dragged somewhere by the
thug on his entrance. You brazenly walk out with your shoplifted item.
58441: The clerk seems to have run away in the confusion of the riots. You
brazenly walk out with your shoplifted stuff.
58530: The clerk doesn't want anything to do with you unless you are buying
something.
58590: Racks of clothing line the walls.
58623: You compare the blouses and tights for a while, satisfying your secret
desire to cross dress. But the prices make you gag.
58719: This ain't Home Improvement. Besides, you're broke.
58762: The shelves are lined with bottles of perfume, cologne, hairspray, and
other cosmetic paraphernalia.
58916: You can go northwest to the clothing department, or west to the hardware
department.
59013: As you start to steps away the thug, not entirely incapacitated, trips
you up.
59084: Doubled over in pain, the thug is powerless to stop your retreat.
59136: The thug stops you!
59170: gotexm
As you enter the cosmetics department, a big thug steps out of
the shadows. Making a mocking bow in your direction, the thug says: "Greetings.
I am Sammy 'The Inhospitable' Toriglioni, and I will be joining you for your
dying pleasure this afternoon."  He pulls a gun out of his suit coat and
bounces it lightly in one hand.
59499: Don't bother.
59522: It's plastic, it's purple, it's cylindrical, and you can use it to spray
things. Like hair, for example. That's where the name comes from.
59651: It has kind of a rancid fruity smell. What were you expecting?
59709: You wave the hairspray around at random. The air now has kind of a
rancid fruity odor, which clears away after a few seconds.
59816: You do not blind him further, since his eyes are already squinched shut
in pain.
59892: You spritz the thug right in the face. He is so totally surprised to
have you actually fight back that he takes the shot right in the eyes and
winces, momentarily unabled to fight back. He's not down yet, but this might be
a good time to finish him off.
60076: That worked on ONE guy at point blank range. It's not going to work on
all these guys. Even if you managed to spray one of them, the rest would
destroy you before you had a chance to move.
60235: You've got a lot of things to worry about today that are worse than your
hair problems.
60378: You apply a little hairspray. You're sure
60456: You don't have any money, dude. This has something to do with your lame
job.
60534: He's big and mean. At the moment he's rubbing his eyes and bellowing
angrily.
60596: He's big, mean, and lying on the floor gasping for breath.
60639: He's big and mean. He prevents you from exiting.
60700: You give him a kick to the stomach, and a passable imitation of a karate
chop on the back. Normally this wouldn't have worked, but since he was
temporarily blinded, he never saw you coming. He collapses on the floor,
momentarily winded. This would be a great time for you to get out.
60903: You move in for another attack.
60933: You make a fist and lunge at the thug. He sees you coming from a mile
away. Though clearly astonished that you have chosen to interrupt the
obligatory bad guy soliloquy, he doesn't mind stopping long enough to shoot
you.
61104: "We're going to get you now. You'll be sorry you ever tried to cross
us."
61169: "He's da boss."
61200: "What a bitch."
61225: "I'm gonna kick your ass."
61265: "I'm the guy that was sent ta kill ya."
61296: The thug ignores you and continues his ranting.
61336: He really doesn't care.
61383: "SO, ya wanted to be a hero, kid?  I'd say your future as the Lone
Ranger isn't looking too promising."
61472: The thug says, "Don't get me wrong. We were greatly impressed with your
style in totally screwing up all our plans for Guido's escape and the biggest
crime wave this city has ever seen. It's just that we really couldn't respect
ourselves if we let you live."
61666: The thug tosses his gun from hand to hand. He has an easy, casual air
about him, knowing that you're trapped and savoring the suspense.
61775: The thug postures and generally acts menacing. He's obviously
overconfident and just dragging out the moment of execution.
61875: The thug is tired of talking.  The newspaper will report the next day
that you accidentally shot yourself five times in the head and seven times in
the chest.
61999: Not to be stopped by a little thing like hairspray, the thug straightens
and blasts you in both kneecaps.
62080: The thug gets up and kicks your ass.
62188: SOMETHING, QUICK!!!!!
62217: The pizza box seems to be ticking. Hmm, interesting. You didn't know
these things had any mechanical parts.
62296: Now that the bomb is gone, the pizza box can be used once again to
actually hold pizzas.
62371: It's already open!
62421: ihn... AND THERE'S A BOMB INSIDE!!!!!
62478: They don't get more closed than this.
62517: You close the box. You hope maybe if you can't see the bomb, it won't
hurt you.
62576: You close the pizza box.
62615: The box flops around crazily and the bomb falls out right next to you.
Maybe this is a good time to contemplate how aerodynamic a big flat hunk of
cardboard can be. Then again, maybe there isn't much time to contemplate
anyth

KABOOM!!!!!
62788: Without even looking in the box, you fling it as hard as you can. It
flies open and a bomb falls out, exploding on impact with the ground.
62947: You'd have to wrestle it away from its owner first... and trust me,
you'd lose.
63010: A security guard stands in front of the entrance to the government
building, looking bored.
63093: The guard steps aside and lets you pass.
63127: The security guard stands in your way. "Sorry," he says. "I can't let
anybody in without a badge, unless they're on official business."
63242: "Yeah, yeah, official business, pizza delivery to Jill Thompson, I know.
So go on up there already."
63326: The guard looks suspicious as you explain that you have a pizza delivery
for Jill Thompson, the District Attorney. Pulling a cellular phone off of his
uniform, he dials a number that you presume is for Jill's office. After a few
moments, he hangs up and grudgingly steps aside for you.
63561: "We've had to step up security around here. Apparently some punk broke
into the mayor's office earlier today, and with the riots going on, the mayor
needs to be as closely guarded as possible."
63715: "I can't let you in unless you can convince me that you've got some kind
of official business up there."
63801: "Looks like a pizza box. What about it?"
63834: "I can't tell you anything about that."
63892: Um, okay. That's an interesting idea, but if you lose your pizza now
then you won't be able to make your delivery and you'll get in all kinds of
trouble. Better not.
64029: You'd never fool the guard into thinking that you were making a pizza
delivery with an empty box. At least not while it's OPEN!
64142: You are in a crowded courthouse.
64170: You are in a deserted courthouse.
64561: "Miss Thompson," says the judge, "I've had about enough of you wasting
this court's time. Unless you can demonstrate a clear threat to public safety,
I'm going to recommend that Mr. Calzone be transported to a minimum security
prison pending further review. His trial is to be held next week."
64820: "Your honor, I wish you would reconsider," says
64863: ipn. "The defendant has a long history of disappearances, and it is
counsel's opinion that he will not be around in a week to stand trial. I
recommend transporting him to a more secure prison."
65005: "Your opinion is duly noted, Miss Thompson," says the judge
sarcastically. "But the fact is, the 'long history' you refer to is based on
hearsay. Now, I recommend you gather some solid evidence when you prepare for
the trial, because the minimal research you've obviously done won't be enough
to convict the defendant."
65248: ipn tries desperately to convince the judge that Guido "The Armadillo"
Calzone plans to escape, but it's obvious she won't get anywhere without more
evidence.
65508: ipm approaches and shakes your hand warmly. "That was a brilliant work
in there, kid. If it hadn't been for you, Guido might have escaped from jail." 
Seeing your blank look, she says, "My name Jill Thompson. I'm San Doppleton's
District Attorney. For the past four years, I've been pursuing this local mafia
branch, trying to bring some serious legal action down on them. These guys seem
to own everything in town, and they already know me by sight. So I can't find
any more clues before the trial but you can. Please try dig up whatever
information you can, I'll be up in my office if you need me. I work at Gunther
& Associates. It's on the third floor of that tall building over there, you
can't miss it."

Jill walks away to the west.
66061: The bomb explodes!
66118: Thinking fast, you deposit the bomb in the sewer duct. Moments later,
you breathe a sigh of relief as you hear a quiet splash. No doubt you've saved
yourself and the city from certain destruction.

An absolutely massive
explosion rocks the ground beneath your feet. Buildings tremble all around you
and the pavement lurches sickeningly. After a moment the shockwaves die down,
but you still feel an occasional tremor. Seems like you might have triggered
some sort of geological disaster.
66495: For a lawyer, Jill strikes you as being a serious babe. She's in her
mid-thirties, dressed in a power outfit and sporting a serious no-nonsense look
that tells you she's going to go places in her career.
66643: You've never been up to date on local politics, but you can see that the
DA is an attractive brunette in her mid-thirties. Why, that would make her
only, uh... ten years old than you!

The more you look at her, the more you
think she's a total babe! You bet she could totally go for a guy like you! 
After all, she's a brilliant, successful career-oriented woman with a promising
future ahead of her, and you're... you're a college dropout pizza delivery
boy.

Never mind.
67005: The district attorney stands in the middle of the courtroom, looking
flustered.
67071: "I'm happy right where I am. Unless you got something important to tell
me, I advise you to stop wasting my time."
67171: "I don't see that here."
67192: "I don't want it, thanks."
67225: "I don't have it!"
67246: "But I need it!"
67264: Jill hands it over.
67279: Jill doesn't want to.
67302: Jill didn't ask you anything.
67335: "Please don't interrupt, I'm giving testimony."
67394: I've been the DA for two years."
67432: "I suspect that something very serious is going down involving the local
mafia branch. It's up to you to investigate."
67532: You'll have to specify whether you mean the metal file that Guido
planned to escape with, or the secret file you uncovered in the mayor's office.
67653: "Thanks for preventing Guido's escape."
67700: "That secret file you dug up has sure been helpful."
67739: "It would be nice if we could dig up some incriminating information
about the mayor."
67820: "I really appreciate all your help."
67856: "They're the citizens of San Doppleton. You don't get out much, do you?"
67925: "I didn't order it. Maybe the defendant did.
67989: "Good work getting past that guard, Stan. That was very creative."
68040: "I can't get past him. I hope you can."
68085: "Sounds like somebody's out to get you. What I don't understand is, who
could have planted that bomb in the pizza box?"
68192: "You know your boss better than I do."
68288: Thanks to you, now I can finally prove it!"
68321: I only wish I could find a way to prove it..."
68358: "Sorry, I can't tell you anything about that."
68399: Like Jill would care.
68421: She dodges. Apparently Jill doesn't find you as cute as you find
yourself.
68507: dhgipn opens her briefcase, pulls out a can of mace, blasts you with it,
and puts it away. After a moment, the pain subsides.
68662: dhpipm looks astonished when you tell her where you found the file. She
marches smartly up to the stand and shows this new evidence to the judge, who
can't argue with her logic. He orders Guido into a maximum security prison
pending further review.

As the courtroom clears out, the bailiff drags Guido
past you. With intense calm, Guido looks you right in the eye and says, "That
was a mistake, my friend. It don't pay to mess with The Family.
68982: "I believe THIS belongs to me," he adds, ungraciously snatching the
pizza box from your hands on the way out.
69071: 8 opm

"I believe THIS belongs to me," he adds, collecting the pizza box
from the floor on the way out.
69169: dhpipn looks annoyed. She says "I didn't order that!"
69210: "Please don't just hand me every object you find lying around. This
isn't a Sierra game, you know."
69295: Your effort to sweep Jill off her feet fails pathetically.
69342: Guido "The Armadillo" Calzone sits here, smirking.
69404: Guido grins broadly. "Yes, I ordered a pizza!"
69448: Guido's glances around shiftily for a moment, then scowls. "I don't know
anything about that," he says pointedly.
69531: Guido looks away and smirks. Looks like he doesn't care what you have to
say.
69593: He punches you back.
69612: _fddXnGuido snaps his fingers and several very large thugs appear out of
nowhere to make short work of you.

Since he did this in full view of the
judge, he of course gets sentenced to life plus 25 and never escapes. Not that
that's any consolation to you.
69835: Guido grins shiftily and takes the pizza from you. He hands it to his
lawyer so he can eat it later. You walk away, congratulating yourself on a job
well done.

Several days later, a crime wave hits the city, more enormous and
devastating than any you've ever seen. You never figure it out for sure, but
you always suspect that it was all your fault.
70085: Guido grins shiftily and takes the pizza from you. He hands it to his
lawyer so he can eat it later. He undoubtedly thinks he's going to use that
file to escape. But you'll have the last laugh, since you so cleverly took out
the file first.
70264: After cleverly taking the file out of the pizza so that Guido would not
be able to escape, you now decide it would be an EVEN BETTER idea to give it to
him. Maybe you were hoping that he'd make a mistake in front of the court.
Nope. Experienced professional that he is, Guido pockets the file in one smooth
motion and no one notices a thing.

Several days later, Guido's escape is front
page news, but most of the newspapers get stolen in the ensuing crime wave
anyway.
70599: He doesn't want it.
70643: Forget it. You'll have to wait until a little later in the game.
70722: The defense attorney low-fives Guido under the table, muttering, "Looks
like your contact came through." You don't understand, but you decide to just
walk away, congratulating yourself on a job well done.

Several days later, a
crime wave hits the city, more enormous and devastating than any you've ever
seen. You never figure it out for sure, but you always suspect that it was all
your fault.
71003: The defense attorney low-fives Guido under the table, muttering, "Looks
like your contact came through." You smile privately to yourself. You'll have
the last laugh, since you so cleverly took out the file first.
71156: "Don't bother me, I'm busy getting rich by defending big mafia dons."
71210: He just doesn't want to be bothered.
71243: It's better if you leave him alone. He's busy, and you don't want to be
slapped with contempt of court.
71336: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge south.
71419: Let's keep it that way.
71478: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge north.
71588: Jill runs out of her office. "Stan!  Thank goodness you made it!  The
mafia has just regrouped in the mayor's office to discuss their final plans for
total citywide domination! Reinforcements from the state are on their way, but
they're going to need some kind of diversion to get into the building without
being caught by the mayor's troops!  Can you do that for us?"

Of course you
can; you're the hero. (A paper-thin excuse if you ever heard one, but you don't
seem to have enough excitement in your life anyway.)

Jill runs back into her
office.
71991: The doors on this floor are all locked, and trust me, they're going to
stay that way.
72052: You have no business in any of these offices.
72100: The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge south.
72204: Jill stops you. "Sorry," she says, "but it gets kind of drafty up here
in the afternoons."
72273: A lawyer stops you. "Sorry," he says, "but it gets kind of drafty up
here in the afternoons.
72360: The stairs angle up and back and you emerge south.
72464: The stairs angle up and back and you emerge west.
72514: This door leads to the mayor's office. It is
72642: Two big, mean guys are blocking the door.
72680: There's about a bazillion mafia guys and they're all blocking your exit.
72751: It's just a solid oak floor. Nothing special.
72786: It's an oak floor with a great big gash in it.
72831: You beat on the floor with your fists. It doesn't help.
72885: Swinging the axe high above your head, you pause for just a minute and
look Mr. Tasker in the eye. "I'll see you all in hell," you comment
lightly.

You bring the axe down with a mighty chop, smack in the middle of the
crack in the floor. A gigantic rift opens in the floor. The mafia guys topple
and fall right down into the office below. Having seen it coming, you manage to
leap onto the window sill, out of harm's way.

At the same moment, the door
opens with a loud crash. Seven heavily armed police officers barge in, aiming
their weapons at you. "You're under arrest..." they begin to say.

"No, YOU'RE
under arrest," says a voice behind them. You grin broadly as you see Jill
leaning on the door frame. Backing her up is a great big SWAT team. Using the
evidence that you collected for her, Jill was able to get support from the
state's higher court and expose the corrupt local government.

"How convenient
that your mafia friends just happened to land right in my office," says Jill.
Looking past her, you see all the dark suited guys being handcuffed and booked
by the SWAT team. The team leader adds, "You're all under arrest for bribery,
corruption, public endangerment, impersonating police officers... and, um,
extreme stupidity."

"Take 'em away, boys," says Jill.

As the police drag Mr.
Tasker past you, he says to you, "I hope you realize... YOU'RE FIRED!"  "Fine!"
you reply. "You can take this job and shove it anyway."  Jill chimes in,
"Especially since you have a brilliant career as a hired investigator ahead of
you!"

You look at Jill as the dust begins to settle. "Really?" you ask. "How
about a future on date with you?" She smiles and gives you a big kiss. The
earth moves for you. Or maybe it's just the quake.
74191: Oh my. You seem to have crashed (pardon the pun) a private party of some
sort. There are a couple of dozen guys wearing suits and dark glasses. And
sitting imperiously at the mayor's desk, glaring at you behind a bevy of
bodyguards, is... <gasp> your boss, Mr. Tasker!!!
74402: Robert "Tasty" Tasker speaks. "Stan, you idiot, can't you get ANYTHING
right?  I ask you to make one simple delivery in the afternoon and you have to
go and ruin all my plans."
74547: Robert "Tasty" Tasker continues his rant. "By now, I'm sure even YOU
have figured out that Guido was just a fall-guy, a figurehead. His escape from
jail would have been a purely symbolic event. I'm the real leader of the mafia
around here. A pity that information won't do you any good since you'll be
dead."

Your eyes are drawn to a movement on the street below. Looking through
the broken glass, you see a huge squad of police cars. You breathe a sigh of
relief... maybe they're here to save you!

A huge tremor shakes the office
building.
74950: Outside the window, a cop steps out in front of the cars, holding a
bullhorn. "STANLEY, THIS IS THE SAN DOPPLETON POLICE. YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR
ILLEGAL BREAKING AND ENTERING, ASSAULT ON A STATE OFFICIAL, AND ESPIONAGE. COME
OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP."  Your sigh of relief dies.

"With the mayor receiving
kickbacks from us, you didn't *really* think the police would be on your side,
did you Stan?" says Mr. Tasker wryly. "Looks like you're all finished, kid."
75387: Robert "Tasty" Tasker, overbearing pizza guy and mafia don
extraordinaire, keeps talking. "After you fouled up the escape of our front
man, I figured that bomb would have done you in. But it looks like I'm going to
have to finish you myself, since I just can't rely on incompetent employees
anymore." 

Another tremor shakes the building. You notice a hairline crack
opening up in the floor.
75678: "Think of this as a favor, Stan," says Mr. Tasty as he reaches into his
coat pocket. "You're a terminal loser. If I didn't conclude your pitiful little
life this way, you'd never have amounted to anything anyway. Maybe you'll get
your name in the papers now."

Outside, you hear the police shouting on the
bullhorn. "WE HAVE GIVEN YOU FAIR WARNING. WE ARE NOW COMING UP TO GET YOU."
75999: Robert "Tasty" Tasker draws his hand out of his pocket, and he is
pointing a gun at you.

The building rumbles violently. The floor is definitely
cracked. It looks like this structure won't last much longer. 

Outside, you
see the police filing into the building.
76200: Following the boss's lead, all the other guys in suits reach into THEIR
coats and pull out guns. This is definitely not a comfortable situation.
76315: The room reverberates with a loud wave of clicking as the mafia guys all
cock the hammers on their guns. "I wish I could say it's been nice knowing you,
Stan... but it really hasn't," says Mr. Tasker.

You hear the heavy tread of
booted footsteps on the stairs, coming up beneath you.

The ground trembles and
shakes crazily under your feet. The crack in the floor is slowly widening. You
have a feeling your time left on this earth is very, very short.
76653: All hell breaks loose as the door splinters and smashes open and the
mayor's police force barges in. Gunfire, screaming, the ground giving way
beneath your feet, and every other kind of pandemonium you can possibly
imagine. It seems kind of like overkill to tell you that you're dead at the end
of it.
76876: You'd have to fight your way past all those mafia guys first. Frankly,
I'd give you better odds to win the California state lottery three times in a
row.
76992: "Shut up, Stan. When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you."
77043: Mr. Tasker will not be swayed from his plan, and you can't get at him
behind all the rows of bodyguards.
77332: You raise the axe high above your head and give a loud barbarian yell.
As you rush toward the horde of mafia guys, one of them pulls out his gun and
shoots you. Contrary to conventional wisdom, they don't always miss.
77508: You open the mayor's file cabinet. A massive quantity of paperwork is in
there.
77572: Amongst the paper you see a particular file which looks suspicious.
77697: As you walk into the office, Jill spots you. "Hi!" she says. "Listen,
Stan. I have reason to believe that the Mayor is tangled up in the mafia. I
managed to use some connections to get this key. It unlocks the mayor's
cabinet."  She hands you a key. "I'd use it myself, but I already have several
eyes on me at all times. They know me."
77986: You smugly retrieve the file.

Just are you're starting to feel
disappointed about how easy it was to search around in the mayor's secret
files, you hear a commotion out in the hall. Suddenly, you find yourself
staring into the shifty face of Mayor Winnick himself. He quickly assesses the
situation and makes a curt gesture. In walks a very large, very ugly lackey,
who begins to approach with a nasty look in his eye.
78303: A broken glass box.
78318: "In case of emergency, break glass."
78367: It's already broken.
78388: It's too strong to break with your bare hands.
78430: Oh sure, like THAT'S going to work.
78468: You smash the glass.
78508: Kind of grasping at straws now, aren't you?
78613: Since the box is secured to the wall, it doesn't go anywhere. You bang
yourself up pretty well, though.
78705: You can't do anything with it while it's behind the glass.
78759: The mayor is guarded by his lackey.
78786: Rather than concentrating on the mayor himself, maybe you should channel
your efforts into getting the heck out of here.
78875: Full marks for effort, zero for creativity. He's bigger, stronger, and
better armed than you.
78974: The henchman approaches with a mean gleam in his eye. It is highly
recommended that you find an escape route.
79061: The henchman is almost upon you.
79099: The henchman riddles you with bullets.
79139: You smashed it up pretty good. Now it's just a bunch of shards of glass
lying on the ground.
79264: It doesn't or close anymore. It's just a big mess of broken glass.
79316: You open up the window.
79345: It doesn't or close anymore. It's just a big mess of broken glass.
79397: You close the window.
79427: You excuse yourself for your rude entrance and leap back out the way you
came. Finding yourself hanging from the windowsill once again, you take your
chances and jump. Too bad Jill wasn't around to catch you this time.
79590: You have no reason to do such an obviously suicidal thing.
79656: Desperately looking for a way out, you climb out the open window. You
find yourself dangling from the window sill over a three-story drop.
79767: The window is closed.
79794: It's already broken.
79819: The mayor stares at you, astounded that you would add insult to injury
by vandalizing his office after robbing him. He shoves his henchman aside and
strangles you with his bare hands.
79946: You smash the window up real good. Alerted by your violent assault on
his office, the Mayor himself bursts into the room together with a guard. To
your surprise, instead of arresting you, the guard pushes you through the
window.
80195: If you let go of that window sill, that could be arranged.
80243: The mayor and his favorite thug are in there. Let's not push our luck,
okay?
80305: Unless you're Spiderman, that's not very likely.
80363: Unless you can fly, that's not very likely.
80396: Unless you can walk through walls, that's not very likely.
80507: Inside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey congratulating each
other on getting rid of you.
80591: Inside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey engaged in low
conversation, too quiet for you to hear.
80678: You hear the mayor inside, advising that they check to make sure you're
really gone.
80759: The mayor and the lackey look out the window. They are surprised to see
you.
80824: You're in trouble now. The lackey is drawing his gun.
80878: Being perverse, the lackey shoots your hand. You release your grip and
fall.
80962: You release your grip on the window and you're falling, falling...

In
the interest of good taste, we'll spare you the details of what happens at the
bottom.
81087: Timing, Stan. Timing is everything.
81144: You release your grip on the window and you're falling,
falling...

"GOTCHA!"  You find yourself in the remarkably strong arms of Jill,
who hauls you into her window and onto solid ground. You've never been so happy
to see anyone in your life.
81326: etvkxm
You briefly relate to Jill what's just been happening to you.
Jill looks thoughtful as she takes the file from you. "So you uncovered
evidence that the mayor is connected to the mob?  And he knows that you found
out. This sounds serious. If I'm not mistaken, every cop in the district is
going to be after your head pretty soon.

"Good work, though, Stan. Don't stop
now. I'm going to phone the state police and see if I can get outside help on
this case."
81666: You're already holding onto it.
81704: Just let go of the window sill so you can free your hands first...
81774: Don't mess with it. If you release your grip on the ledge, you'll fall.
81856: You frantically kick on the window below you, hoping that somebody will
hear.
81918: You kick on the window again. Something's definitely happening down
there.
81986: It's closed.
82044: There seems to be some activity in the room on the second story.
82101: The window down below is opening.
82141: Somebody sticks their head out of the second story window... by god,
it's Jill!
82238: Jill looks up at you anxiously.
82274: Jill didn't ask you anything.
82302: The idea here is to DO something. You're not going just hang here and
ask her stupid questions.
82376: Jill's a little to startled by your predicament to react to what you're
saying.
82437: Your lips just aren't that long.
82484: Kick Jill in the face?
82516: Jill nods frantically. She holds out her arms trying to reach you.
82635: If you let go of that rope, that could be arranged.
82689: You climb up the rope. Smart move.
82721: The rope swings a little bit, and nothing more.
82832: The window is closed and locked from the inside. You can't do anything
with it.
82897: You bang on the window for a while. It doesn't yield, but you do succeed
in attracting the attention of the mafia guys inside. They finish you off right
there.
83039: You'll either have to drop the rope or untie it first.
83078: The stairs angle down and back and you emerge south.
83174: Giving a mighty yell, you boldly leap off the side of the building!  The
rope tightens and then swings you back towards the building. You do your best
to look like Bruce Willis as you haplessly zoom towards the window...
83336: CRASH!!!
83372: Looking behind you as you leap off the roof, you can't help thinking
that it might have been a better idea to be holding the other end of the rope.
83477: You take a dive off the third story roof. To be honest, it's not the
most brilliant idea you've had this evening. A height like this is not enough
to kill you, but quite enough to cause you severe pain and make you spend the
rest of your life as a vegetable in the hospital.
83670: There are hardly any storms in Southern Cal, but when it rains it pours.
Right now, there's not a cloud in the sky. So for all practical purposes, the
lightning rod is just a big stick conveniently anchored to the top of this
building.
83911: In a freak act of nature, a lightning bolt leaps out of the clear sky
and strikes the rod just as you touch it with the metal file. You should know
better than to saw off parts of buildings.
84060: The coil of rope is tied to the lightning rod.
84097: Hope that rope holds.
84114: It is a coil of rope, about twenty-five feet long.
84161: The place is filled with debris from the riots. Lying on the ground you
see a rope and a hammer which have been randomly flung off the shelves.
84269: A rope lies in a heap on the ground, one end tied to the lightning rod.
84372: You cleverly tie the rope to the lightning rod, dropping the other end
on the ground.
84433: By golly, it looks like the rope is ALREADY TIED THERE. You are about as
astounded as can be by this revelation, considering that you were the one who
tied it in the first place.
84582: Oh, I know what you're trying to do. You want to anchor yourself to the
lightning rod and rappel down the side of the building, right? Well, forget it.
The rope is so short that you can barely reach the edge of the roof while it's
tied around your waist. Frustrated, you untie yourself and muse that just
climbing down would be easier.
84819: Maybe tying yourself up would satisfy some kind of kinky fetish of
yours, but you aren't coordinated enough to do it anyway.
84911: Jill doesn't know you well enough to let you tie her up.
84957: Guido didn't get to be a big mafia don by allowing puny little pizza
guys to capture him. He resists your assault easily.
85062: . As nice as it looks there, you change your mind and take back the
rope.
85131: The rope isn't tied to anything.
85166: You untie the rope and leave it on the ground.
85209: You untie the rope and take it with you.
85254: The rope is tied up at the TOP, remember?
85305: You climb around on the unattached rope for a while. Then you realize
how stupid you look and you stop.
85393: You climb down the rope as far as you can. For the second time today,
you find yourself outside a third story window.
85494: You climb back up the rope.
85565: You pick up the other end of the rope. Now what?
85615: You've already got one end.
85664: You drop your end of the rope.
85695: You release the rope and plummet to the ground.
85748: You can't swing on the rope unless you're hanging from something.
85800: Well... yes, good idea, but you might want to be holding on to the rope
first.
85877: You swing back and forth for a minute, but you realize that you'll never
get enough momentum to break inside. If only you could get more leverage.
86106: "Reverberations" is my entry in the second annual interactive fiction
competition. As you have probably noticed already, the narration has a very
regional Southern California flavor to it. Knowing that competition games may
be witnessed and judged by people from out of the country, a "Surferese to
English" dictionary has been provided. If you don't understand a slang word
such as "dude", for example, try typing "explain dude" and I will clarify.

For
people who aren't familiar with interactive fiction, here's a brief overview.
This game is a short story in the style of a comedy/action thriller. You play
the role of the main character, Stan. The game will describe your environment
and your situation. It is then up to you to type, in simple English statements,
what Stan should do next in order to further the story. To get a feel for the
game, try beginning with these commands:

EXAMINE COUNTER
   READ NOTE
   TAKE
PIZZA BOX
   GO SOUTHWEST

It pays to examine everything and try every dumb
action you can think of. Remember, if you get yourself killed, you can always
type UNDO to back up one move. So don't be shy.

Have fun, dude!  Later days.
87687: Usually this is the point where I burst into tears and say "There are
just so many people to thank!"  But there aren't that many.

I would DEFINITELY
like to thank Gilbert Quintana for his infinite patience in testing and
critiquing this game, always on much too short notice. I only wish I'd been
able to use more of your ideas.

I would also like to thank my mom, who does
not like text adventures at all, but nevertheless managed to come up with a
couple of neat plot twists that made the final cut. (For the record, the bomb
starting the earthquake and the hairspray escape scene were both her ideas, but
she denies it vehemently.)

And, of course, I must obviously thank Graham
Nelson a lot. If it hadn't been for the magnificent Inform compiler, I might
never have had the patience to write a text adventure that didn't suck. Or this
one, for that matter.

Finally, I want to thank Greg Kuperberg for playing
"Reverberations" two years after the competition, and caring enough to report a
whole slew of juicy bugs and inconsistencies which I fixed.
88744: Guido "The Armadillo" Calzone is the guy who ordered a pizza.
88903: Well, persistence pays. Try it again!
89031: Give her the file.
89257: Throw the bomb into the sewer. Sorry about the consequences, but it's
unavoidable.
89430: After you spray the thug, attack him in any way you can. Then leave.
89567: Search the drawer.
89813: After you see her emerge down below, drop the window sill.
90028: Show a pizza box to the guard.
90314: Chop the floor with the axe.
92612: A Hectic Voltairian Adventure
Copyright (c) 1996 by Russell
Glasser.
Updated and revised 1998
92844: Score:
92852: Moves:
92860: Time:
92868: You can't go that way.
92968: You look blond and studly, if you do say so yourself. Your tan's kinda
faded, though. Remember, just another month till summer.
93060: The front of the pizza parlor is southwest.
93092: You could walk behind the counter to the northeast, or exit to the
south.
93144: It's a large, flat, greasy cardboard box. Hastily scrawled on the
outside is the word "Calzone". Which is weird, because it's clearly a pizza.
93364: The street runs east and west here, or you could return to the pizza
parlor to the north.
93428: By the sidewalk you can see a small sewage outlet.
93464: That's where you work.
93488: On this end of the street, a department store called Barkley's sits to
the south.
93548: The street runs back west, and Barkley's is to the south.
93622: Now serving you at 623 convenient California locations!
93664: You are in the clothing department at Barkley's. There are many racks of
clothes here. You may exit to the north. To the southwest lies the hardware
department, and southeast is the cosmetics department.
93808: You can go deeper into the store southwest or southeast. The street lies
north.
93864: He is dressed in a weedy little clerk outfit.
93896: You are in the hardware department at Barkley's. There are tools all
over the place. You can go northeast to the clothing department, or east to the
cosmetics department.
94016: Northeast to the clothing department, or east to the cosmetics
department.
94068: Just looking at it all makes your testosterone level rise, and you feel
the need to give something more power.
94144: Northwest to the clothing department, or west to the hardware
department.
94196: You are approaching the center of downtown San Doppleton. There is a
courthouse to the south. The street runs east and west.
94284: You are in downtown San Doppleton. The street coming from the east ends
at a three-story office building to the west.
94368: The street runs east from here, and ends at an office building on the
west side.
94424: The gun is pointed right at you!
94448: He stands in front of the government building with his arms folded.
94496: You can only go north.
94512: Looks like you really made somebody mad when you ratted on Guido "The
Armadillo" Calzone. For a moment you contemplate revising your good samaritan
complex.
94624: You recognize the defendant, Guido "The Armadillo" Calzone from dozens
of newspaper photos which stem from this highly publicized trial. The man looks
unusually at ease, considering that he's potentially nine hundred and fifty
thousand years in jail for a wide variety of charges. In fact, he has such an
air of confidence about him that you'd almost think he was planning to escape
or something.
94900: This guy looks just as sleazy as his client.
94932: Stern and imperious.
94948: You are in an office building. The exit to the street is east. There is
also a flight of stairs heading up to the north.
95032: There are fronds on either side of the exit on the east.
95072: Typical California lobby fronds. They look like good fronds with each
other (har, har).
95136: To the east you can see an office door labelled "Gunther & Associates";
other than that, the office doors on this floor are pretty unremarkable. The
stairs go up to the south and down to the north.
95280: You try a few of the office doors, but they're locked and there is no
response to your knocking.
95348: To the east is a door labelled "John Winnick, Mayor of San Doppleton".
The stairs go up to the north and down to the south.
95440: You try a few of the office doors, but they're locked and there is no
response to your knocking.
95508: You are in a bustling law office. The east wall is dominated by a large
window.
95564: You can only go west, back to the hall.
95592: Through the closed window, you see a pretty unremarkable spectacular
view of downtown San Doppleton.
95664: You are in a high-rise government building. You can go southeast to the
street or up some stairs to the west.
95740: Up the stairs or southeast to the street.
95772: You are on the second floor of the government building. You can go back
down the stairs to the west or up some more stairs to the east. To the east is
an office.
95888: You try a few of the other office doors, but they're locked and there is
no response to your knocking.
95960: You are in the mayor's office. To the east is a window overlooking a
second-story drop. There is a glass box mounted on the north wall.
96056: If you want to jump out the window, you'd better say so. Personally, I
think you're crazy.
96124: The only exit is west into the hall. That is, unless you count that big
window on the other side.
96192: You never liked your boss much BEFORE you found out he was a mafia don.
Your opinion of him has not improved now that he's trying to kill you.
96296: They just stare at you. They're pretty obviously pissed off, but their
faces register absolutely no emotion.
96372: A big file cabinet with a bunch of drawers.
96404: Um, well Stan, it appears to be a key. What we have is basically a small
flat metal thing with a little round handle on one end and some ridges on the
other that are intended to slide into a locking mechanism. Jill already told
you that it unlocks the Mayor's file cabinet. So on the whole, there's not a
lot more to be said.
96632: At the top it's labelled "My connection with the mafia, by Mayor John
Winnick."

Well well, won't Jill be happy to see THIS!  For a moment you think
about how utterly ridiculous it is that the mayor would make his illicit
activities so easy to discover.
96816: A heavy fire axe.
96836: John Winnick, mayor of San Doppleton, is here, looking like a corrupt
political slimeball. And he means business.
96920: This guy is about to kick your ass.
96946: You are dangling over a three-story drop, desperately clutching the
window ledge with your fingertips. And as if that weren't bad enough, a very
angry mayor and a very large security guard are inside, and they're both very
eager to get rid of you.

Your feet are just low enough to touch the window on
the next floor below you.
97176: You're hanging on it.
97232: The window is open, you're hanging out of it, and inside there are two
guys trying to get rid of you.
97304: Your feet are dangling near a window down below.
97340: The mayor is leaning out the window, looking at you.
97384: The lackey is leaning out the window, looking at you.
97428: Jill's head is right near your dangling foot. She seems unsure what to
do next.
97484: You are swinging gently in the breeze (and the force of the worsening
earthquake) outside the mayor's window. Looks like a big party going on in
there. You can see the mayor, a bunch of security thugs, and lots of other guys
wearing sunglasses and suits. Luckily, no one seems to have noticed you yet.
97696: You can't get in the window.
97720: The window is closed and locked from the inside this time.
97760: You are on the roof of the government building. You can go back down the
stairs to the north. There is a lightning rod sticking up.
97852: It's a big old ball-peen hammer.
97876: That's something that you don't have.
97910: . SEE chick.
97932: a term used to address a male with whom the speaker is especially
familiar. Abbreviation of brother, though the reference is usually towards a
good friend.
98040: Bruce Willis is an unexplainably popular American film actor, best known
for his roles in the "Die Hard" series. Mr. Willis' movies are always filled
with lots of explosions, broken things, and extremely dramatic entrances such
as the one you just performed.
98252: xtremely attractive and/or sexy one. SYNONYM: babe. ANTONYM: dog.
Feminists, my sincerest apologies for including such demeaning words in this
otherwise highly nonsexist game.
98468: That's a very naughty word which your mother wouldn't want to hear you
using.
98532: an unattractive woman or girl. ANTONYM: babe.
98614: . A man or boy; a person of the male sex. Polite and friendly
connotation.
98672: In joke, text adventure fans. Steve Meretzky's controversial game,
"Leather Goddesses of Phobos", was one of the first computer games to
incorporate sexual content.
98798: . A young surfer; a beginner. Condescending but not necessarily
insulting.
98876: yes, "Hangin' out" is a play on words, because "to hang out" also means
to lounge or loiter, to relax. Don't you just hate puns like that?
98980: Hoof it, v.i. To move quickly; to leave.
99064: there was a craze involving four characters from a comic book series.
The characters were "Ninja Turtles", four human-sized reptiles named after
Renaissance painters, who lived in sewers and had a fondness for eating pizza.
The craze spawned an animated series, three really bad live-action movies, and
endless plastic toys, among other things.
99312: You must be referring to the coolest text adventure ever written.
99360: Rule, v.i. Being exceptionally good or desirable; fun or strongly
motivating. The experience of attending a rock concert by subject's favorite
artist "totally rules". ANTONYM: "suck".
99584: Shyeah, interj. Derived from "sure" and "yeah"; yes. In the sample
phrase "Shyeah, right", the intent is heavily sarcastic or skeptical,
expressing extreme doubt about the prededing statement.
99728: Suck, v.i. Being bad or unpleasant. An experience which sucks is to be
avoided. A person who sucks is obnoxious, stupid, or generally irritating.
Probably loosely derived from the concept of oral sex. ANTONYM: "rule".
99898: . Television. Shortened form of "boob tube".
100244: Choose an area of the game where you would like hints.

     BEGINNING

     MIDDLE (after Guido is in jail) 
     END (once the riots have started) 

    FUN STUFF TO TRY
100432: Look around you. Have you seen what's on the counter?
  (3 hints left)
100560: . S. W. S.
  (1 hint left)
100586: In real life, you wouldn't have the benefit of hindsight. But since
this isn't real life, read the text and figure out how you lost the game.
  (4
hints left)
100702: Your action of delivering the pizza caused Guido to escape and
subsequently go on a crime spree. Now how did that happen?
  (3 hints left)
100884: Now that you know you'd be responsible for Guido's escape, you could
just walk away and refuse to deliver the pizza. But there seems to be a higher
moral imperative here.
  (3 hints left)
101068: She doesn't have enough evidence to prove that Guido plans to escape.
But you do.
  (1 hint left)
101140: Uh... what am I supposed to be doing? 
     I delivered that pizza and
lost the game!  What's up with that? 
     Okay, so now I know what happened.
Of what use is this information to me?
101442: That other pizza box didn't used to be on the counter. What's in it?
 
(3 hints left)
101508: Right, you knew that. Okay, you've got a bomb on your hands. How can
you get rid of it?
  (2 hints left)
101820: Okay, not QUITE long enough to escape. You'll have to do one other
thing first.
  (1 hint left)
101940: She gave you a key to the mayor's filing cabinet. Use it.
  (1 hint
left)
102056: Well, of course it wouldn't be THAT easy to escape. But notice how
conveniently you've positioned yourself...
  (4 hints left)
102290: I keep getting blown up in the pizza parlor! 
     What's with this
thug who keeps killing me in the department store? 
     What do I do in the
mayor's office? 
     There's a very angry mayor in the room with me. Help! 
  
  I'm in imminent danger of being a pancake.
102552: Well, the guard outside won't let you in unless you're on "official
business", right?
  (3 hints left)
102628: Think about *your* profession. What kind of official business could you
possibly have?
  (2 hints left)
102826: You can't get in the door anymore. An assault from above might work
better.
  (4 hints left)
102934: What, you tried climbing down the rope?  That's WRONG. You need to make
a much more dramatic entrance.
  (2 hints left)
103322: "Another tremor shakes the building. You notice a hairline crack
opening up in the floor."
  (1 hint left)
103402: I want to get into the mayor's office building, but there's a guard
there. 
     Now how do I get back to the mayor's office? 
     This sure looks
like a grand finale to me. I'm too young to die!
