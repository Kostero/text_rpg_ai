76656: You can't put something on top of itself.
76688: Are you sure you want to restart?
76712: Attempt to end transcript failed.

76764: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.

76912: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
76980: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
77020: The game file has verified as intact.
77048: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupt.
77092: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
77152: Even science can't explain what the gods usually know. You have moved
beyond the synchronistic environment and into a void devoid of null and full of
nothing. Your mind will make it real but who controls the mind?
77304: You stand in the middle of the desert on a sand deposit so large there
is no dune in sight. Only the bright whitish sun hangs as the center piece to a
boring portrait; A portrait you are not so sure if you are a part of. The sky
glows a solemn blue turning into nothing but a haze as the horizon meets the
burnt sand.
77524: In each direction you can see hazy beginnings. To the west, you make out
the glow of a city street. To the east you make out a giant cauldron. To the
north you are unable to make out much of anything and to the south nothing but
a pale white backdrop.
77700: The wind picks up a nebula of dust then dies down again.
77742: Red clouds form off in the distance.
77772: The vulcher cries out in disgust, anguish, and madness.
77814: The vulcher taunts you from up above.
77846: The vulcher swoops down and steals your hat and proceeds to chew on it.
77900: The vulcher peers down at you looking for something to steal.
77948: An old woman on the side of the street beckons you to hear her plead for
forgiveness. Her gaze does not lie on you however, but rather at the
cobblestone below, still damp and reflecting the faint yellow glow from the
streetlight. You stand at the corner of a boutique and butcher's shop.
Tenements covered in grime and accessed through bolted doors prove this
street's vacancy.
78244: Old rusty cars pass down the street, their drivers hidden inside the
dingy metal boxes. A group of rats fester in a knocked over garbage can.
78344: The street is eerily quiet save for a car or two passing by.
78388: The old woman gives an weird look.
78412: The thick air holds in the scent of moist trash and car fumes.
78456: Your surroundings shift into a dark red mystical blur with a gigantic
iron vat in the middle. You gag as you waft the contents of the cauldron but a
faint light appears among the murky goo. You hear whispers and make out what
seems to be eyelids flashing open all around you. You make out what can only be
described as pulsing veins in the grey mist illuminated in red. A pedestal
stands to the northwest of the cauldron.
78744: Deep throbbing rumbles vibrate from your surroundings.
78784: A flash of light distracts you from the otherwise terrifying place.
78830: The cauldron bubbles and splashes its content about the room. You hear a
high shrieking noise enough to make you plug your ears and wince. The symbols
on the side of the cauldron illuminate in a bright purple. Suddenly you glance
at the pedestal and notice a hot fudge sundae sitting there.
79032: The cauldron no longer stirs, as if the magic was swept away from it.
79080: The cauldron gurgles and the sound of laughter fills the room.
79124: You almost walk yourself right off the edge of the cliff before
embracing a rock to hold you back. It's as if this cliff divides what is real
and what isn't. From a certain angle you wouldn't even know it is there. You
can't make out what is below except for a haziness drenched in mystery.
79328: The cliff must be an impenetrable wall from the perspective of those
down below.
79384: Let's hope you don't accidently get knocked over the edge.
79428: You willfully leap from your safe perch down into the mysterious
unknown. The abyss into which you have cast yourself continues for infinity.
Any possibility of understanding what happened to you is now lost. It is up to
you to decide if your newly discovered fortune is a good thing or a bad thing.
79636: You find yourself on the inside of a white coffee mug. If it wasn't for
the faint breeze of a diner fan above you it would be hard to tell where you
were. It is a good thing the contents of this cup have been drunk already
although you can still make out the scent of a freshly poured cup of Joe. An
enormous spoon, by comparison to your newly found size, rests against the rim
and extends down to the bottom of the cup.
79924: An enormous spoon, by comparison to your newly found size, rests against
the rim and extends down to the bottom of the cup.
80010: What confounded science has brewed the pot of coffee likely just
finished by a diner patron? You begin to realize the enormity of the void and
the vast potential it stores. Are you still in control of it?
80154: You smell breakfast being cooked above you.
80188: You make it up the spoon in one piece suddenly growing in size to find
yourself in the diner.
80256: You suddenly lose your voice in the midst of your tune.
80296: You hear the sound of plates clanging.
80324: It is the pungent smell of coffee.
80348: All lights in the diner seem extraordinarily dim. The jukebox in the
corner glows yellow and red and purple casting its colors onto the table and
pictures on the walls. Only barstools and a bar stand in this diner. It is a
cramped little place not unlike a sort of hopeless retreat for the sinners and
loners. The exit lies through the door left ajar to the southwest.
80604: A waitress leans against the counter staring out the window. You can see
in her eyes the image of a soulless individual.
80688: You hear "The Poncho Song" playing.
80716: You hear the clanging of plates as breakfasts are being cooked up in the
kitchen. The jukebox remains silent.
80792: The waitress commends your singing while the baroness sharply ignores
you.
80844: This is a place that everyone knows about yet no one is aware of. It is
the edge between black and white. It is the smallest number larger than zero.
Your mind makes it real. You have crossed beyond the thought of infinite. You
occupy infinite.
81016: This is your surroundings. This is all you perceive for the time being.
81068: Do you really think praying will change your perception of the world?
81116: Classical music starts playing, an oboe first, then clarinet, and a
large string arrangement.
81184: Top 40 radio hits occupy your hearing.
81212: A jazz ensemble plays an uptempo tune.
81240: You hear the sound of chilled beats.
81268: Tribal beats induce a trance like state. Your surroundings begin to fade
but you quickly snap back into reality.
81348: You sing "The Poncho Song" to yourself as laughter grows and wanes from
an unknown source.
81414: You hear the lowest octave of a harmonium.
81448: The lowest octave is joined by the next highest octave.
81488: The next highest octave joins the other two.
81520: The next highest octave joins the other three.
81554: The next highest octave joins the other four.
81590: The next highest octave joins the other five.
81626: The next highest octave joins the other six.
81660: All eight octaves join in unison before they eventually fade out.
81706: His gaze befuddles you. His eyes seem to pop out of their sockets with a
frightening clarity that makes you turn away. Yet still he looks quite hungry
and your inability to lay to rest any pity thwarts your attempt to ignore the
mangled creature. 

"OHH am I hungry!" he cries out.
81908: The creature seems invulnerable to any attack.
81940: The vulcher bats it away and chuckles.
81968: "Use the command 'talk' for conversation"
82000: "You look like quite the tasty dessert from a diner menu, but I grow
weary up here in the sky all day long. I circle for hours and never find much
to eat."

He sneers your way flapping his wings in large undulating motions
perhaps waiting for your reaction with a plot in his mind.
82196: "Well if you keep bothering me we won't ever make progress. Ok, I tell
you what you little banana split, I have a proposition."

His snicker grows.
82304: "If you bring me a delicious treat then I will refrain from eating you.
It makes it easier on me and perhaps you may value your life enough to want to
live it."
82416: "What are you waiting for!? I grow ever more weary by the minute, maybe
even by the second you little peach cobbler."
82500: The vulcher lays his eyes on the sundae and swoops down to grab it. He
practically tackles you into the dirt while sticking his head into the sundae.
He stops for a brief moment to say, "This is so tasty and delicious" before
deciding that the hot fudge sundae is not enough to satisfy his hunger. 

"My
insatiable desire for food to fill my hunger never dies. I am afraid, my little
apple streudel, that I am in the need of the main course. Dessert is fantastic
but the saying that you will spoil your appetite by eating dessert first does
not apply to me. 

"How about I try a bite of you to see how good you are
first," he says as his beak clasps down on your ring finger and he gulps it
down his throat. 

"You will do just fine," the vulcher snickers as he proceeds
to dive into your chest, starting with your liver. You soon begin to remember
what happened to you. It all seems overwhelming but you had been on the run
from the local sheriff. 

You had been the reason for the death of many,
unsettling the northern and southern armies. The confederate general was
hunting you down for having stolen weapons and collusion with the north. You
were a traitor. 

Not one hour ago you had run into the confederate army. You
had escaped but suffered tremendous blood loss from a shot to your liver. Now
you lie here in the desert with a vulcher eating away at your corpse.
83456: The vulcher is not impressed with what you have brought him. He begins
to eye you up.
83516: It is finely grained sand blown in from the west.
83552: It is extremely hot to the touch.
83576: The sun hangs high in the sky.
83600: It is about 8 feet wide, 4 feet high. Dirt and grime has built up along
its outer face.
83664: It is bolted to the floor. You wonder why that is.
83700: The cauldron bubbles and froths and the color of its content distorts.
83752: You go to place the object in the cauldron and the ground beneath you
shakes. The veins pulse more violently and the cauldron spits the object back
at you.
83860: The cauldron is plenty full. It just seems to be missing a few
ingredients in order to produce anything from its vile, spiritual containment.
83960: You see dozens of spider eggs attached to the underside of the cauldron.
84010: You remove the grime and dirt off the side of the cauldron to reveal a
message. 

Het retga REMA cmeomnds oseth owh kees teh suptanrerrual orf hlep.
Pary dan ym respow lliw eb elaverde.
84144: It is definitely mystical in origin. That is your only conclusion.
84192: You aren't putting your hands in that disgusting liquid, if that is what
you can call it.
84256: You put a small hand full of the liquid in your mouth and immediately
induce extreme vomiting, causing you to go under for quite some time. But you
regain your strength.
84372: Terrifying.
84384: Het retga REMA cmeomnds oseth owh kees teh suptanrerrual orf hlep. Pary
ot ym enma dan ym respow lliw eb elaverde.
84468: It is too dirty to see what might be on the cauldron.
84508: The eyes open and close sometimes in unison circling the room in a wave.
84560: You look deeply into the eyes and see nothing there, as if these eyes
were a part of all the many lives that are blind to the world around them.
84660: They pulsate in rhythmic patterns.
84684: It looks delicious.
84700: A large flat slab of stone, finely cut, rests atop a four foot high
cylinder. Its circumference is cut in a zig zag pattern resulting in triangular
ruffles.
84808: The top of the pedestal is surprisingly smooth and has not collected any
dirt at all.
84872: She chants in a strange tongue; Every verse letting out an untangible
laugh. It is a cross between the maniacal laugh of wicca and the lengthy drawn
out laughs of circus performers. Her makeup runs down her round face dripping
onto her triangular nose and onto her quivering lips where it resides begging
to enter the mouth.
85096: She ogles the statue for nearly fifteen seconds, her eyes lighting up,
seemingly knocking her out of her trance. The old hag picks it up and fondles
Rockefeller's feet before they give way revealing a hidden compartment inside.
Her long fingernails sift through the compartment before grasping a folded up
piece of cloth. Unfolding it gently, the old woman now appearing in full
ecstacy bares the prize inside, that being a full silver dollar from before the
turn of the century.
85426: She turns back to you in astonishment that such a poor soul would bear
such a magnificent surprise. She grins and says to you, "This is quite a
magnificent exchange item from your half. I will indeed hold up my end of the
bargain in accordance to the exchange. 

"I know what it is you seek. Your life
may be in peril at the hands of one who would like to see your end, even more
than yourself! 


When you have lost all your marbles 
And your mind's in the
cobbles 
Find the way towards the mushrooms 
Where the men play with brush
brooms 
There lies the big books 
With bags full of small hooks 
And all call
for one newt 
To give a kick with a boot" 

She hands you one newt and returns
the statue.
85928: The old woman delights in the thought of playing with a wooden
merry-go-round. "This is fantastic," she exclaims.
86012: "You should be giving this to someone else in more need of love than
me."
86064: "That thing is hideous. I hope someone steals it."
86104: She vanishes before your very eyes with the same maniacal laughter. As
quickly as she disappeared she reappears, unscathed.
86220: "Forgive me please for the sins I have committed in my life! Won't you
spare me an invaluable? I have nothing much left to live for." 

She runs her
hands over your face as if to abide by some sinister spirit to "check" your
life force. 

"You are already dead inside, my poor soul, like a christmas tree
in January," she laughs. 

"You and I are much in common. Perhaps it would work
in both our interests if we were to commit to an exchange."
86540: "Well, do you want an exchange or not?" she asks vehemently.
86584: She gives a brief smile before returning back to her chanting and
laughter.
86636: The shops are still open for business judging by what you can see in the
windows, but they are closed at this time of night.
86724: A sign on the outside of the building reads "Hannover Towers"
86768: It is a tall, skinny type of streetlight with a bent arm holding the
yellow glowing bulb in place.
86836: It might be a challenge to get up but if you believe you can climb it
you will be able to.
86900: The table has five seats attached to the floor in front of it.
86944: A number of records can be seen inside along with their titles.
86988: The waitress starts listening to the song, her eyes still fixated on the
streetscape through the window. Out of no where she starts into a lengthy
rambling. 
"So then he decided to pick up the lamp and throw it in my
direction. It made no sense to me at the time since, you know, I was clearly
confused by his change of attitude. I mean, it's not like I ever meant to flirt
with that guy in the suit. A friendly smile is all. It's not as if I can help
it that the guy probably doesn't see his lover very often being out of town all
the time. I was just humoring him. Of course just before this incident happened
I had realized I forgot to pay the electricity bill." 

She pauses for a
moment, "I was in the middle of writing my resume for that job at the Pookah
Bar and bam, I lost all of my progress. It just so happened as well that my
girlfriend called asking for money to pay her rent earlier in the day. That
place only stands with the aid of gum and gum bands. I swear the girl can't
make it herself, alone out there. 

Sometimes you just want to take a moment to
let it all soak in and then blow it all out like a dam bursting. Whether the
violent force breaks you or releases you it depends on the side of the dam you
are on, and you wanna be on the top but the dam has no ladder to climb. So you
desperately attempt to clasp on to the walls and pull yourself up. Some people
make it because they have tools and others don't because all they have are
their calloused hands. 

If only the world were made of wood, then it wouldn't
matter what happened to everyone because we would all be made of the same
thing......."
88190: muzzle" and your favorite, "Read It!".
88224: They are portraits of famous movie stars, singers, and musicians, as
well as a few photos of the city including one depicting the burning Harowitz
building.
88332: An ordinary barstool.
88348: You cannot sit where the baroness is sitting.
88382: The baroness does not appreciate you sitting next to her with other
empty seats available not next to her highness. Inevitably, she slides herself
over one seat.
88496: The waitress does not seem to recognize you in the seat you are sitting
in.
88552: An ordinary barstool.
88568: You cannot sit where the baroness is sitting.
88602: The baroness does not appreciate you sitting next to her with other
empty seats available not next to her highness. Inevitably, she slides herself

88900: You cannot sit where the baroness is sitting.
88934: The baroness does not appreciate you sitting next to her with other
empty seats available not next to her highness. Inevitably, she slides herself
over one seat.
89048: The baroness does not appreciate you sitting next to her with other
empty seats available not next to her highness. Inevitably, she slides herself
over one seat.
89160: The waitress responds, "The usual right? A mushroom swiss omelet and a
cup of coffee coming right up." She cracks a smile as she grabs a mug and pours
coffee into it. 
"Here you go!" she says as she places before you the omelet
and the cup of coffee. "It has been a slow morning here, as usual." 

She goes
back to staring out the window.
89408: An ordinary barstool.
89424: You cannot sit where the baroness is sitting.
89458: The baroness does not appreciate you sitting next to her with other
empty seats available not next to her highness. Inevitably, she slides herself
over one seat.
89572: The baroness does not appreciate you sitting next to her with other
empty seats available not next to her highness. Inevitably, she slides herself
over one seat.
89684: The waitress does not seem to recognize you in the seat you are sitting
in.
89740: An ordinary barstool.
89756: You cannot sit where the baroness is sitting.
89790: The baroness does not appreciate you sitting next to her with other
empty seats available not next to her highness. Inevitably, she slides herself
over one seat.
89904: The waitress does not seem to recognize you in the seat you are sitting
in.
89958: Her nose seems to hit the ceiling. The heavy set lady is decked out in
all jewelry imaginable. Her eyes remain shut as if you were not worthy of her
view. She sips her coffee with a disdain for all lifeforms. Her red dress burns
your retina.

90292: "Use the command 'talk' for conversation"
90324: If it wasn't for her need to blink you might not know she was alive. The
short, brown haired girl perhaps in her twenties stands nearly motionless save
for the intermediate glances about the diner. Her name tag reads Mandy.
90480: Nothing will break this girl's lack of concentration.
90520: "Use the command 'talk' for conversation"
90552: She doesn't seem to have anything to say.
90584: She waits for you to take a seat.
90608: She does not recognize you sitting in this seat.
90644: Her eyes try hard not to meet yours, "Yes, that is your coffee. I hope
it is satisfactory."
90712: "Why is it green? It looks awful," she says.
90748: Her eyes try hard not to meet yours, "Yes, that is your coffee. I hope
it is satisfactory."
90890: Mrs. Landett over there left this statue here by accident the other day
claiming it had been her luck and inspiration. She complained it had gone
missing but I never told her that I secretly have been keeping it here the
whole time. Take it quick before she notices. Maybe it will bring you good
fortune." 
She hands the statue over discretely making sure you keep it out of
sight by having you put it in your jacket.
91180: It is just an ordinary mug. White on the outside, filled with coffee.
91232: The bottom of the mug reveals the word LOVE.
91268: Black.
91276: The coffee tastes good and goes down smoothly. The bottom of the mug
reveals the word LOVE.
91362: Rockefeller.
91372: A silver dollar.
91384: Fashion is not your area of expertise.
91412: A newt.
91420: It is the white knight from an ordinary chess set. It appears to be made
of marble.
91480: One of the finest looking omelets you have ever seen. Big juicy
mushrooms blend into melted swiss cheese wrapped nicely in well cooked eggs.
91576: They float all around you.
91596: You make note of each snowflake containing a different pattern.
91640: You make note of the vastness of it all.
91668: You can barely tell it is there.
91692: It is like something out of the antique road show. On the front there is
a pull out drawer with a knob made of iron.
91772: That is much too heavy for you to carry.
91800: Objects start pouring out of the nightstand. Your surroundings become
that of clouds all around you. They move in random directions leaving shafts of
light to pour through at various moments. You can just make out hints of a blue
sky through the clouds.
91976: The long arm of a drill extends over the wooden mouse unable to move.
The drill makes a crevice in its midsection and blood gushes out. The mouse
remains motionless.
92092: Its neck is being sawed at by the deep slices of sharp teeth. Blood
pours out of the thing's neck in lake fulls.
92172: It seems to come out of no where. Its teeth drip with blood and contains
bits of entrails and bodily tissue.
92248: You grapple with the long arm only to result in the drill gashing into
your right shoulder.
92312: It seems to come out of no where. Its bit drips with blood and contains
bits of entrails and bodily tissue.
92388: You grapple with the long arm only to result in the drill gashing into
your right shoulder.
92452: It reflects light it is so shiny and orderly kept. It is strange to see
this thing outside of a kitchen. It seems to lose its purpose out here.
92552: That is much too heavy for you to carry.
92580: Objects start pouring out of the cabinet. Your surroundings become that
of a wintery blizzard all around you. Snowflakes move in random directions. You
can just make out hints of a blue sky through the snow.
92724: The saw divides the flower in half while chlorophyl gushes out. It looks
like it could be a rose but its value would lie on what color it is and this
flower has the color of wood.
92848: You gather the pieces of the flower. It would be pretty useless at this
point.
92904: Did you expect it to be alive?
92928: It is just a miniature but yet the little figure taunts you with creepy
organ music.
92988: This one is still alive and is being felled before your eyes.
93032: The tree is much too big for you to carry.
93064: It is an ordinary chest for holding various objects. There is no lock on
it.
93120: The chest is much too heavy for you to carry.

space with celestial bodies all around you. Comets and asteroids move in random
directions. You can just make out hints of constellations in the blackness.

93328: It contains many obscure recipes of things you have never heard of.
93376: A oil lantern. It glows yellow and orange.
93408: You can't light anything with the glass fixated overtop the flame.
93456: The glass is fixated in place and cannot be removed.
93492: The lantern bursts open. Its oil scatters and ignites the wooden world
around you. An awful stench fills your surroundings as the stars in the sky
seem to fall into nothingness. You gag as you make out the scent of burning
flesh. Soon the void you found yourself in becomes engulfed in flame. 

As you
begin to feel a burning sensation you realize the world around you is nothing
but an extension of the inner mind. The setting snaps back to the diner with
the same waitress still staring out the window.
93840: It might not be a good idea to destroy the fabrications of your reality
yet.
93892: It stands as tall as any skyscraper you have seen. The saw and drill go
to work on it. It won't be long before it is destroyed as well.
93988: The thing is falling apart before your eyes. Why would you want to go in
it?
94044: The elephant moans in agony as the saw cuts off its limbs and ear and
tail and the drill works itself into the wooden elephant's abdomen. It must
remain in place seeing as how it is made of wood.
94180: The elephant cannot be taken with you.
94208: At the moment, you can't think of anything to say.
94548: give" or test "has" or "hasnt" with a non-attribute on the object
