12880: o. You have won
12963: It is now pitch dark in here!
12990: I beg your pardon?
13054: Sorry, that can't be corrected.
13083: Think nothing of it.
13136: As good-looking as ever.
13168: You can hardly repeat that.
13193: You can't begin with a comma.
13307: I didn't understand that number.
13336: You can't see any such thing.
13372: You aren't holding that!

13466: That's not a verb I recognise.
13505: You can't see "
13613: Nothing to do!
13630: There are none at all available!
14540: Please answer yes or no.

16517: Done.
16737: Wrahn seem interested.
17376: You can't go that way.
17936: But it's dark.
17953: You find nothing of interest.
17989: But it's dark.
18080: You find nothing of interest.
19208: . Not bad.
19226: That was a rhetorical question.
19280: That seems unnecessary.
19303: Keep your mind on the game.
19328: What a good idea.
19347: You smell nothing unexpected.
19374: You hear nothing unexpected.
19399: You taste nothing unexpected.

19484: If you think that'll help.
19593: Oh, don't apologise.
19623: Quite.
19692: You achieve nothing by this.
19780: You wave, feeling foolish.
19930: You are unable to.
19949: Nothing obvious happens.
19999: That's not a direction.
20022: Not that way you can't.
20054: Keep your hands to yourself.
20079: You achieve nothing by this.
20112: Futile.

20196: There is no reply.
20215: Nothing is on sale.
20234: Your singing is abominable.
20268: Time passes.
34024: I should think so, too.
34058: That's not the answer.
34081: Sleeping would solve nothing.
44477: The story so far:
44503: Over to you.
44571: You find a steel key!
44589: Alas, nothing else under there.
44772: Best leave him where he is.
44797: He's far too heavy.
44836: He's in no fit state to do that.
45326: You pull the pin.
45813: She's out of your league.
46141: It has been filled in.
49168: Score:
49176: Moves:
49184: Time:
49192: You can't go that way.
49524: Please give one of the answers above.
49552: [You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
49588: [Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
49628: "Oops" can only correct a single word.
49656: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
49688: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
49748: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
49792: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
49832: I didn't understand that sentence.

49916: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
49952: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
49988: You excepted something not included anyway!
50020: You can only do that to something animate.
50052: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
50100: I didn't understand the way that finished.
50132: Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which exactly?
50284: Are you sure you want to restart?
50308: The game file has verified as intact.

50432: You're carrying too many things already.
50464: You can't put something on top of itself.
50496: You can't put something inside itself.
50524: That would scarcely empty anything.
50580: You can only get into something free-standing.
50616: But you aren't in anything at the moment.
50648: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
50688: is now in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gives long
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
50784: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).
50868: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
51044: This dangerous act would achieve little.
51072: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
51104: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
51136: Digging would achieve nothing here.
51164: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
51192: You would achieve nothing by this.
51216: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
51244: But there's no water here to carry.
51272: Real adventurers do not use such language.
51304: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
51332: There's not enough water to swim in.
51360: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
51388: That would be less than courteous.
51412: Is that the best you can think of?
51436: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
51476: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
51508: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
51820: Your attempts too escape of resulted in your untimely demise. Shame.
51868: You analysise your current predicament, but come to no satisfactory
conclusion.
51924: Can't dig stainless steel floors. Basic Physics.
51960: Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.
52008: Surprisingly, this does little too improve your current predicament.
52056: In space, no one can hear you pray. Or something like that.
52100: Positivity is the key too success.
52124: Negativity will be your downfall.
52148: After briefly considering using your, shall we say, unique voice to
subdue the guards, you discard the idea.
52224: It's totally pitch black and you can't see a thing!
52262: Escape from Starship Zenon.
52388: Accused of multi-planaterial murder and thrown in the high-security brig
of a large federal starship with a life sentence. What a downer. There's
probably some fiendishly tricky and elusive way to escape from here if you put
your mind to it, you know.
52562: Type help for help. Please read the read me.
52600: If you ever get out of here, you really must complain to the prison's
standards officers. This place is dirtier and dustier than a dirt factory. If
you didn't have better things to do, you'd be in the right mind too give the
place a jolly good clean just too spite it. There's a heavily built door to the
south.
52818: This is just your average prisoner regulation bed. No quilt, sheets or
pillow. Just a hard wooden board.
52896: You think you see a glint under the bed.
52924: This is a pressure guage that controls the pressure in this room. It has
a glass flap that can be opened and there is a button inside.
53016: A big shiny red button that is inside the glass flap of the pressure
guage.
53068: You need to open the glass flap of the guage first.
53104: A big red light starts to flash on the pressure guage. Perhaps you did
something wrong.
53168: You hear hurried footsteps from outside as a guard rushes up.
53212: The guard rushes in, dodging around the items in the room, almost
falling over a few times and presses the button on the guage. He shouts some
profanity at you before walking off.
53336: A switch that presumably operates the lights.
53368: The lights switch back on automatically.
53396: A steel key. Looks like it might fit a keyhole.
53460: This guard seems to have tripped over something and knocked himself out
when running into the room.
53528: You feel this guard has already had enough punishment. Then you change
your mind and put the boot in a bit.
53604: The prone guard isn't exactly your idea of a perfect date.
53648: He's completely out cold. Can't hear a word you're saying.
53692: You consider kissing the guard then decide to kick him instead.
53820: You shake him vigourously but he won't wake up.
53856: This is a long corridor stretching west and east. The cell you where
once held in is to the north, though you have no wish to return there.
53952: As soon as you walk out of the cell, a guard picks you up and throws you
back in, locking the door behind him.
54036: A white, stainless steel wall stands in your way and doesn't look too
inclined to move.
54100: The janitor is a frail old man who wanders around with a mop and bucket,
cleaning things. He seems harmless enough, but has a twinkle in his eye that
suggests there's more to him than is immediatly apparent.
54244: The janitor doesn't want your affections I'm afraid.
54284: "Ta muchly, guv'nor!" says the janitor, grinning as he returns
54382: "The male office worker is dying to go there, but he's got no chance of
getting a place."
54448: "She's a bit of alright, that female office worker, int she?" says the
janitor, "If I were twenty years younger...."
54536: "Damn good pub, that one." says the janitor. "Only one we got, as well."
54592: "That juke box in the bar only plays Genesis songs." explains the
janitor. "Wanna know why? 'Cos I made it that way." He beams brightly.
54696: He winks at you. "I know's ye is an escaped prisoner, but I won't tell
anyone, don't worry."
54768: "Always ordering me about. Who do they think they are?"
54812: The janitor grins at you and says "I have enough of my superiors
ordering me around without you doing it as well!"
54892: "I may only be a frial old janitor, but I know Dimac. My left little
finger is registered as a deadly weapon hereabouts." You wisely back off.
54994: The janitor wanders off, mopping as he goes.
55030: The janitor wanders in and greets you with a curteous nod.
55076: A section of corridor. You can see your old cell door to the east and
the corridor stretches further west.
55152: A white, stainless steel wall stands in your way and doesn't look too
inclined to move. You even ask politely - how rude.
55240: A section of corridor that stretches east back toward your old cell and
north into some sort of hall. It also leads south to another room.
55336: A white, stainless steel wall stands in your way and doesn't look too
inclined to move. You even ask politely - how rude.
55424: Another section of corridor that leads south into a room of some sort
and west back towards your old cell.
55496: You bang into a stainless steel wall. Ouch.
55528: A reasonably large hall with a security camera positioned to the far
north. The walls are that inhumane stainless steel white that turns your brain
to mush after looking at it for a while.
55656: The camera scans the room, looking for anything that shouldn't be there.
55708: Noticing the camera you quickly dive back south before you are spotted.
55764: The camera just sits there, smoking gently.
55796: A black security camera.
55816: Not much point now, it's in-operational.
55848: You position yourself under the camera and look up at it, but see
nothing of interest.
55908: The black security camera is high up on the wall, too far up for you to
reach it.
55964: Some kind of control room. Unfortunatly you fail to see a big button
marked "Disable security devices"...Might have to be a bit more subtle.
56068: A load of buttons and switches.
56092: You don't know what they might do, so you decide not to tamper with
them.
56144: A sign on the cupboard reads "Surveilance camera electronics - DO NOT
TOUCH, THIS MEANS YOU BOB."
56232: A cupboard is beneath the control panels.
56264: You open the cupboard revealing some electronics.
56300: The armoury is very sparsely stocked. If it where not for the bid red
sign that proclaims "ARMOURY!" you'd probably guess it was just another cell...
56440: This box contains chaff grenades - you can only get one at once.
56488: A chaff grenade, used for disabling electronics. You could pull the pin
and then deposit it somewhere.
56560: Some heavy duty electronics - wires criss-cross everywhere.
56604: Scorched and blackened, these electronics don't appear to be in working
order.
56660: A lift. There's a button that says "Down" on it and also a door to the
south.
56718: The lift shoots downwards and gradually comes to a halt...
56764: A button shaped like an arrow pointing downwards.
56798: The lift shoots downwards and gradually comes to a halt...
56844: The bottom of the lift. There's a button with "Up" written on it and
also a door to the north.
56912: The lift shoots upwards and gradually comes to a halt...
56956: A button shaped like an arrow pointing upwards.
56990: The lift shoots upwards and gradually comes to a halt...
57036: A hallway leading south into a lift of some kind and northwards into a
fairly large room.
57100: This room is large administration office with two desks stacked with
papers, which behind sit two office workers, one male and one female. There are
corridors emitting from this room in every direction and a sign on the wall
that seems to explain where each of these corridors goes.
57292: "You cannot pass without proper paperwork!" snorts the male secretary.
57344: "Sorry, hon." says the female secretary. "You can't pass without
paperwork, unless you bribe us of course." She giggles foolishly.
57444: The sign reads: "South: Cell area. North: Main ship deck. East: Guards
bar. West: Officers Quarters."
57572: The male secretary wears a very prim and proper three piece suit -
jacket, shirt and trousers, with a tie neatly dividing his torso in two. Every
so often he stops furiously scribbling with his pencil to glare at his female
counterpart across the office.
57748: The man gets up and says "No, no, no. You're making the place untidy!"
He picks
57812: back up and shoves it into your hand. The female worker rolls her eyes.
57864: He rolls his eyes. "That damn infernal woman never does any work. She
makes the place so bally untidy as well."
57944: "Something you'll never catch madam over there doing!"
57984: "I cannot be bribed" he says smugly. "Unless you get me a seat at the
officers convention. I want to be an officer one day. But, of course." he
continues, now with a harsher look on his face. "YOU can't get me that seat, so
I can't be bribed."
58164: "I so wish I was an officer, just like Daddy." says the male officer
wistfully. "There's an officers convention soon, if I could attend then surely
I could impress my superiors. If only I had an invitation...."
58320: The male officer suddenly perks up. "You have an invitation for the
officers convention?" he asks eagerly. Seeing you don't, he gives you an evil
stare and sets back down to his work.
58452: "You leave my dear daddy out of this!"
58480: "One must continue with ones work. Go away, you're making the place
untidy."
58536: The male officer doesn't look paticulary attractive, so you decide to
give his lips a miss.
58600: The male officer suddenly perks up. "You have an invitation for the
officers convention?" he asks eagerly. Seeing you don't, he gives you an evil
stare and sets back down to his work.
58732: "By jove!" exclaims the secretary. "You've actually got me an invite. I
won't notice if you pass through now."
58924: "Hah!" scoffs the male secretary. "Why should I do anything YOU say?"
58980: The male secretary gives the female secretary a baleful stare.
59024: "How I wish I was an officer, so I could make Daddy proud." says the
male secretary.
59088: The female secretary gets her purse out and powders her nose.
59132: The female secretary looks wistfully towards the bar, before turning
back.
59240: The female secretary is casually dressed, although she is not to
scruffy. She doesn't appear to be doing nearly as much work as her male
workmate across the office and spends a fair amount of time twirling her pen
around in her fingers with a far away look on her face.
59424: "Isn't he so uptight?" says the female secretary. "Never lets his hair
down, always working."
59496: "Some convention for officers...Him over there," She indicates her
co-worker, " he wants to go. Never shuts up about it."
59588: She flutters her eyelashes. "If you can get me the job in the bar, so I
can get away from this dump and that sour puss." She points across the room to
her co-worker. "Then I'll let you pass through."
59732: "How I wish I could get away from here and go work somewhere else." she
says wistfully.
59842: Now please just give it back to the barman, and I'll let you pass."
59892: "All I want is that bar job, no possessions." she sighs.
59936: The female secretary giggles. "Sorry hon, it's more than my jobs worth
to do that."
60000: "I wish I had that job at the bar." she sighs.
60036: Finally, a bar! Somewhere to quench your thirst for a pint of smooth,
creamy ale...Your mouth begins to dribble, until you realise you have no money
to speak of.... Your heart sinks, and you pause to take in the surroundings. It
looks rather like a 20th century wine bar, with classy furnishings well placed
around the room. There is a large sign on the wall.
60292: It's a raging stonker of a duke box! If you know your juke boxes, and
you surely do, it's nothing less than one of the now legendary Rock-Ola's, from
1961. It appears to be jammed on tracks from Genesis.
60444: The juke box rocks violently, but refuses to fall over.
60484: You hear Phil Collins singing his heart out on the juke box.
60528: The Juke box momentarily lapses into playing an Elvis Costello track,
but someone hits the offending box and it resumes playing "Home by the sea.".
60636: The distinctive voice of Peter Gabriel can be heard from the jukebox.
60688: Classy and well placed. Very aesthetically pleasing.
60768: "Barmaid wanted!" reads the sign, "Ask Sandy the barman about 'job' for
more info."
60832: A barman beams at you from behind the bar.
60864: Sandy the barman is a fine figure of a man, standing some six feet tall.
His head is topped by masses of ginger curls below which there are thick ginger
eyebrows. To finish the image off, some ginger whiskers bristle underneath his
nose. He's beaming quite hugely at you.
61052: You approach Sandy, your intention clear, and he draws a large
knobkerrie from underneath the bar. "Move another inch and you die, punk." he
says, calmly, his face suddenly seeming to catch the light in unfavourable
ways. You step back, and the beaming face returns.
61240: As you approach the barman, unfriendly intentions at the forefront of
your mind, you catch a glimpse of a large knobkerrie that he is idly holding in
one hand and tapping against his other. You back off.
61380: "Here's the application form, it's really quite simple." explains the
barman, "Just give it to whoever wants the job and get them to fill it in. I
assume you're not applying for the job as a barmaid." He laughs and winks at
you.
61544: "I already gave you the form, just give it back to me when you're done."
says the barman.
61608: He whistles between his teeth. "Aint she a beauty?" he says, "Always
seems to play Genesis music though, funny that."
61696: He leans closer to you and whispers in a conspiratorial manner.
"Actually, I'm a natural blonde. I dye all my body hair this way because I like
it."
61804: "Might I draw your attention to the sign upon the wall sir?" asks the
barman.
61892: "Sorry guv." says the barman "I can't do that."
61932: An application form for the post of barmaid at the bar.
61972: Rather than an officers social hall, it appears to be a place of work.
There is a photocopier stood on a table and a smart looking officer type sat
behind the desk.
62086: The officer takes his invite back off you before you leave.
62136: This officer looks very officious. Looking at him, words such as
"bustling" and "puffy cheeks" come to mind. He looks like one of those old
style military men, and displays several medals on his green jacket. This
jacket is kept company by a pair of green trousers, which you can just see from
behind the desk. He displays a bristling moustache which is surrounded by the
red, puffy mass of his face.
62416: Not fancying that moustache up against your skin, you give kissing the
officer a miss.
62476: "This is my invite," says the officer, handing you a bit of paper. "You
are free to peruse it and wish you had one of your own." He sniggers.
62580: He snorts. "Bally common folks bar, that one. We officers have our own
private bar." he says smugly.
62656: "Talk sense, man!" exclaims the officer, puffing his cheeks out.
62704: The officer accepts the invite back off you.
62736: "Hah!" snorts the officer, "What could you possibly have that I'd want?"
62792: Probably not a good idea attacking one of the top brass chaps.
62836: The officer laughs. "I'm not doing anything that you say, peasant."
62888: A white table with metal legs and a plastic top.
62924: A big photocopier with somewhat simple controls. It appears you open it
up, put whatever you wish to copy inside and then press the "On" button on the
side.
63036: The photocopier merrily chugs away for a few minutes before depositing a
copy of the invite in your hand. You then retrieve the original invite.
63136: There's nothing inside it that can be copied, so it refuses to start.
63192: An invite to the officers convention, given to you by an officer.
63240: A photocopy of an invite to the officers convention. Doubtless it could
pass as the real thing.
63308: A south/north corridor. To the south is a large room of some kind while
the corridor leads north to some sort of airlock.
63392: Before you stands a bulkhead door, looking every inch your ticket to
freedom. Unfortunatly, it doesn't appear to have any method of opening. Back to
the south you can see a large room, while to your east lies a small control
room.
63556: A small, dank control room, which only has the one button. An incredibly
strange state of affairs for a control room, really. It's a big button, if it
helps.
63668: It's a big red button. It's the only button in this room, and probably
gets rather lonely. It's just begging you to push it.
63786: You won!
63796: The guard runs into the room and, in the darkness, you hear a clatter
and then a thud. Grinning sheepishly, you push the button on the pressure guage
and wait for the lights to return.....
63932: You push the button, but nothing happens.
63964: You push the button, and hear the grind of machinery.
64004: You leap through the airlock, and find an escape pod at the other side.
How convieniant! You engage the throttle and speed away into the unknown.
64106: This really is all too good to be true. Escaped from the spaceship with
not a scratch or scrape and now your own escape pod to call your own, there
must be a catch somewhere.
64230: I expect you'll find out in the sequal.
64264: The grenade explodes in your hands, knocking you to the floor and giving
you a nasty shock.
64328: The grenade explodes, with no visible results.
64364: The grenade explodes - you hear the electronics fizzle out.
64408: "It hasn't been filled in yet!" says the barman, "Get someone to fill it
in, then bring it back."
64480: "Thanks!" exclaims the barman, "I'm sure she'll be very happy in her new
position, she'll be starting here very soon."
64644: About Escape from the Starship Zenon.
64702: All commands should be typed in lowercase.
64736: The following commands do not take up any turns of game time:
64782: LONG/VERBOSE - In verbose mode, room descriptions will always be shown
in their entirety.
FULL/SCORE - Print various information about your current
score and rating.
QUIT/SAVE/RESTORE - Quit, save your current status, or
restore previous status.
64988: The following commands take up one game turn:
65290: You can ORDER characters to do something, although they are usually not
very happy about responding.
65364: This game has been in development on and off for quite some time, and
has finally come to fruition now, the sixteenth of May, year two thousand. It
is written in Inform, and was turned into a stand-alone applicaton by Maxzip.
