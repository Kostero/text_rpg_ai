11875: Think nothing of it.
11928: As good-looking as ever.
11960: You can hardly repeat that.
11985: You can't begin with a comma.
12099: I didn't understand that number.
12128: You can't see any such thing.
12164: You aren't holding that!

15313: Done.
15524: Wrahn seem interested.
16105: You can't go that way.
16665: But it's dark.
16682: You find nothing of interest.
16718: But it's dark.
16809: You find nothing of interest.
17937: . Not bad.
17955: That was a rhetorical question.
18009: That seems unnecessary.
18032: Keep your mind on the game.
18057: What a good idea.
18076: You smell nothing unexpected.
18103: You hear nothing unexpected.
18128: You taste nothing unexpected.
18163: Keep your hands to yourself!
18188: You feel nothing unexpected.
18213: If you think that'll help.
18322: Oh, don't apologise.
18352: Quite.
18421: You achieve nothing by this.
18509: You wave, feeling foolish.
18659: You are unable to.
18678: Nothing obvious happens.
18728: That's not a direction.
18751: Not that way you can't.
18783: Keep your hands to yourself.
18808: You achieve nothing by this.
18841: Futile.
18870: You talk to yourself a while.
18897: This provokes no reaction.
18925: There is no reply.
18944: Nothing is on sale.
18963: Your singing is abominable.
18997: Time passes.
32367: Hey! No sleeping on duty!
32404: That's not your strong point.
41516: You regain your balance.
41642: A "lean and hungry" gentleman
41756: You're a troll. But you're not
41822: Whoosh!
42238: What, raw?
42737: Still no good.
43562: Slash!
43942: A hollow voice says "Troll".
43982: Nothing happens here.
44038: That's not a verb I recognise.
44454: Quack.
44499: One.
44618: Better luck next time round...
44786: It's not that flexible.

51192: You can't go that way.
51524: Please give one of the answers above.
51552: [You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
51588: [Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
51628: "Oops" can only correct a single word.
51656: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
51688: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
51748: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
51792: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
51832: I didn't understand that sentence.
51892: You seem to have said too little!
51916: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
51952: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
51988: You excepted something not included anyway!
52020: You can only do that to something animate.
52052: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
52100: I didn't understand the way that finished.
52132: Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which exactly?
52284: Are you sure you want to restart?
52308: The game file has verified as intact.
52336: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupt.
52380: Attempt to begin transcript failed.
52408: Attempt to end transcript failed.
52432: You're carrying too many things already.
52464: You can't put something on top of itself.
52496: You can't put something inside itself.
52552: You can only get into something freestanding.
52584: But you aren't in anything at the moment.
52616: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
52656: is now in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gives long
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
52752: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).
52836: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
53012: This dangerous act would achieve little.
53040: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
53072: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
53104: Digging would achieve nothing here.
53132: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
53160: You would achieve nothing by this.
53184: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
53212: But there's no water here to carry.
53240: Real adventurers do not use such language.
53272: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
53300: There's not enough water to swim in.
53328: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
53356: That would be less than courteous.
53380: Is that the best you can think of?
53404: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
53444: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
53476: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
53564: Commendable attitude, for a troll. However, you're only paid to attack
adventurers.
53696: You invoke the great trollgod Ushnaktha. Feel better now?
53740: You swear sulphurously to yourself.
53766: It's not much of a job, but the Dungeon Master was looking for a guard
troll, so you volunteered. You were given the standard-issue axe, and told
to... well, guard.
53900: As nasty-looking as ever.
53920: Trolls are sadists, not masochists.
53948: Trolls rarely talk to others, let alone themselves.
53984: This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a
forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by
an axe) mar the walls.
54098: A low-pitched siren, designed by the Frobozz Magic Siren Company
especially to be inaudible to adventurers, echoes through the dungeon. Right on
cue, your shift-change shambles into the room from the eastern passageway, axe
swinging from his hand (and occasionally notching chips from his ankles). Time
to clock off and meet up with the Thief and your foreman the Cyclops; you were
just starting to get the hang of this game "poker" last night.
54452: You nod to him, one professional to another.
54484: You idly wonder whether you'll recoup your losses with him and the other
lads at poker tonight.
54552: From the looks of the bulges, he's had good pickings.
54592: You're meant to guard this room, not the passageway.
54632: You're meant to guard this room, not the cellar.
54668: The passages through there are twisty and all alike. You don't want to
get lost.
54728: You stretch up and touch the ceiling. Fairly solid.
54768: You experimentally tap the floor with the haft of your axe. Doesn't seem
worth trying to dig through.
54840: You walk straight into a wall. Doesn't really hurt, but doesn't get you
very far either.
54904: What if an adventurer came upon you unawares? Fine guard you'd be.
54952: Letting go of your issued weapon during a guard action is a capital
offence. Usually, the enemy can be relied upon to carry out the execution.
55052: Destruction of Dungeon Master property is most definitely outside the
terms of your contract.
55216: darts back into the cellar. Your orders don't cover this eventuality.
Best to stay put,
55312: The adventurer is even less of a conversationalist than you are.
55356: Letting go of your issued weapon during a guard action is a capital
offence. Usually, the enemy can be relied upon to carry out the execution.
55456: I think that you have failed to grasp the strategic basics of this
situation.
55512: There's a time and a place for everything. This, apparently, is a time
and a place for being attacked.
55588: The adventurer doesn't appear in the mood. This may have something to do
with
55748: An elvish sword of great antiquity, glowing a bright blue.
55792: The adventurer swings it out of your reach.
55860: There's a trick to disarming adventurers. You're due for that training
session in five day's time.
55932: The lamp is on.
55944: The adventurer swings it out of your reach.
56016: Oh, excellent idea! Plunge the adventurer into darkness, and take
advantage of your superior dark vision to finish off the combat quickly. Shame
that
56156: the lantern out of the path of your axe. Never mind. You'd only have got
into a quarrel with the grues over the body, anyway.
56244: You are still recovering from that last blow, so your attack is
ineffective.
56328: You swing your axe, but it misses.
56354: Your axe barely misses the adventurer's ear.
56428: Your axe crashes against the rock, throwing sparks.
56466: Your axe gets the adventurer right in the side. Bet that hurt.
56514: The flat of your axe skins across the adventurer's forearm.
56664: Your axe swings down, gashing the adventurer's shoulder.
56706: An axe stroke makes a deep wound in the adventurer's leg.
56864: You land a killing blow. The adventurer is dead.
56900: You neatly remove the adventurer's head.
56932: Your axe stroke cleaves the adventurer from the nave to the chops.
56980: Your axe bashes in the adventurer's skull.
57086: The adventurer's swing misses you by an inch.
57122: A mighty sword blow misses you by a mile.
57154: The adventurer charges, but you jump nimbly aside.
57194: Clang! Crash! You parry the adventurer's sword.
57234: The adventurer strikes you on the arm. Ichor begins to trickle down.
57286: The adventurer pinks you on the wrist, but it's not serious.
57332: The adventurer's stroke lands, but it was only the flat of the blade.
57382: The swordblow lands, making a shallow gash in your arm.
57424: You receive a deep gash in your side from the elvish blade.
57466: A savage blow on the thigh! You are hurt, but can maybe still fight.
57562: The adventurer's sword flashes out and connects painfully with your
midriff.
57618: The force of the adventurer's blow knocks you back, stunned.
57664: You fall back against the ferocity of the adventurer's attack.
57710: It's curtains for you as the adventurer's sword removes your head.
57760: The next, fatal blow strikes you square in the heart.
57800: You take a final blow and slump to the floor dead.
57876: It appears that that last blow was too much for you.
57980: Now, let's take a look here... No, I don't think you deserve another
chance. You are only a troll, after all.
58100: If you're mistaking this for Zork, you're horribly deluded.
58144: I think that phrase is getting a bit worn out.
58176: You appear to be repeating yourself.
58248: The adventurer says "Hey! I didn't ask for any spoilers!"
58292: And a fine figure of a guard you look.
58320: You can't make a judgement on that.
58348: These feet were made for stompin'.
58376: Well, if you say so. You're not very good at it, though. Umm...many?
lots?
58436: You have lost your mind. Not that there was much to lose.
58480: Why count something when you can hit it with a big hefty axe instead?
58612: You're bored, but not that bored.
58680: his head from his neck. He doesn't look as if he
58716: her head from her neck. She doesn't look as if she
58752: Junior employees do not waylay senior employees. Not if they value their
job.
58808: You swing the axe with deadly force. Consider the adventurer
instakilled.
58860: You'd be dead by the time help arrived.
58888: The Cyclops has his own job to do elsewhere.
58920: You can only wait for something animate.
58984: HINTS disabled.
59364: Why did you really write this game?
59392: And if it's only a coding exercise, why did you release it publicly?
59664: net 4000); I can't remember what it was about, or who made the comment
(probably, though not definitely, one of David Dyte, Dan Shiovitz, or Admiral
Jota), but someone made a crack about how boring it would be to be the troll in
Zork; just standing around, and if an adventurer comes along, kill them.

I
picked up on the idea as a neat one for a coding exercise; this is my first
Inform game. Not much of a size, but I've learnt lots about all sorts of good
stuff.

[David Dyte has since claimed to be the miscreant responsible for
coming up with the idea. Who am I to argue?]
60088: Good question. I suppose someone might get a laugh out of the concept.
Oh, and see if you can spot the deeply-buried, highly obscure Enchanter
reference.
60364: int-fiction, inter alia. Do I get to mention an addiction to Babylon 5
here? No? Shame.
60468: if you're interested. Does that help?
60498: People who'd probably hate to be associated with this, and probably
don't know why I'm thanking them, but whom I ought to mention for one reason or
another:

David "flatterer" Dyte, Lucian "Lucian" Smith, Neil de Mause, Dan
"inky" Shiovitz, David Wildstrom, L. Ross Raszewski, Andrew Plotkin, Zak
Arntson, Gareth Rees, Graham "of course" Nelson. And all those raif posters
whose questions and answers I plundered via DejaNews.

Most of the game text
that I haven't made up on the spot was taken from Dungeon; some other from
Zork, which, as it said in the blurb, is a registered trademark of Activision,
Inc. and is used with permission. (Cheers, Laird.)

Note that this game is
freeware. Do with it what you will, bar hacking it about and not saying that
you've done so. Gaudete.
61084: Well, although this is only a small almost-game, I've tried to put in
some fun stuff. The usual sort of thing, responses to 'xyzzy', 'zork', 'hello
sailor', etc. More ways of hitting people, given the theme of the game. A
couple of box quotes (No! Not the box quotes!) in response to swearing and
thinking. And, which gave a considerable amount of trouble, you can > WAIT FOR
adventurers. ("
61376: he tells me...").

Feel free to email me with comments, bugs, flames,
suggestions and offers of money (ha!); though it's unlikely there'll ever be a
release 4 of this game. There's only so much time you can spend on a single
joke, after all...

Oh, and if you finished the game without ever resorting to
UNDO, congratulations - and don't you have better things to do?
