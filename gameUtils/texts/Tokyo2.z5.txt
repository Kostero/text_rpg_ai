66012: {I}A fat elbow prods you in the ribs. "Hey, quit fidgeting!"
66064: {I}A prod from your neighbour: "Hey, buddy, Julie Andrews you ain't!"
66124: Our hero prefers to laugh in the face of danger.
66160: {I}A fat elbow from the next seat prods you awake. You must have been
snoring.

66372: That doesn't seem to be important in the current scene.
66412: That doesn't seem to feature in the current shot.
66448: The seat is hard and the popcorn is tasteless. A pair of teenagers
play-fight in the back row -  they probably sneaked in without paying. A
distressingly huge and sweaty bulk lowers itself into the seat next to yours,
engulfing the armrest.

This had better be worth it!
The teenagers snort at
some whispered wisecrack.

Suddenly the lights dim. The murmur of conversation
dies away and all eyes turn toward the screen...
66760: WNTOWN TOKYO.
66816: WNTOWN TOKYO.
66842: PRESENT DAY.
66890: Shadowed streets writhe with colour and movement. A tide of pedestrians
flows through gorges of concrete and glass, rippling and eddying against the
store-fronts.

In the backwater of a street cafe sits an English newspaper. The
pages lower and we catch a first glimpse of our hero, reading an editorial over
his bowl of soup.
67124: The man sits at an outdoor table surrounded by swirling crowds. He turns
a page of his newspaper and takes a sip from a bowl of steaming soup.
67224: In the middle of a nervous crowd stands our hero, directing a
penetrating glance up the street.
67292: Though ordinarily a man of action, our hero has no urge to leave his
comfortable table.
67352: Before moving, our hero pauses warily - there's something not quite
right here...
67412: Our hero can't move for the crowd frozen in the street.
67452: They're just cheap extras, Rent-A-Crowd. They probably had to do their
own makeup too. And it shows.
67528: It is The Times (imported), but we aren't close enough to make out the
date. The front page headline is "MISHAP AT JAPANESE DRUG LABORATORY", while a
subheading below reads "Doku Defends Animal Testing Procedures".
67704: The bustle of the street sounds somehow off-key today.
67744: Oversized lettering reads "Doku Vitamin Tonic: NEW SUPER FORMULA". Below
is pictured a surprisingly large Japanese boy holding a bottle of bright orange
liquid. The finer print at the bottom is impossible to read from this distance.
67928: The soup is a piquant concoction of chicken, seaweed, noodles, and
chilli. He eats it in the Japanese way, with chopsticks for the chunky bits,
and long noisy slurps of broth taken directly from the bowl.
68072: With an eye on the table for more signs of shaking, our hero ventures a
slurp of soup.
68132: Our hero enjoys a long slurp of soup.
68160: It's such good soup, he just can't bring himself to put it down.
68208: A wonderful, piquant aroma wafts from our hero's soup bowl.
68250: A huge scaly foot stands atop a pile of rubble.
68286: Abruptly, the surface of the liquid is broken by a pulse of circular
ripples, forming and dissolving as if rocked by some tiny tremor of the earth.
Our hero looks up sharply, but the crowds have registered nothing unusual. The
flier pinned to a nearby pole shivers, though not with the breeze.
68492: Suddenly the table jerks, upsetting a bottle of soy sauce and sending it
rolling over the edge. The flier drops to the ground. The crowd pauses for a
moment, then moves on.
68614: This time the quake is obvious, and accompanied by a dull rumble.
Abandoning his newspaper and soup, our man joins the hesitant crowd for a
better look up the street.
68732: The ground shakes again, with the sound of crumbling masonry. Heads
lift, necks twist, and all eyes come to rest at the end of the street. A
stunned silence descends on the frozen crowd.

What was a grand hotel just
seconds before is now a pile of twisted rubble, surmounted by a huge and scaly
foot!
68944: A deathly hush has descended. All eyes are drawn towards the monstrous
foot atop the ruins of a nearby building.
69024: The crowd stands frozen, immobile before the huge taloned foot.
69070: {I}A podgy elbow digs you in the ribs: "Hey get a load of those special
effects! That foot is awesome!". A snigger erupts behind you.
69174: Unable to avert his gaze any longer, he finally glances at the huge
foot...
69232: Our hero stares open-mouthed at three impossibly massive toes, scaled
and reptilian, each ending in a cruel claw the size of a canoe. Slowly his eyes
follow the thick leg skyward, coming to rest at last on the obscene and
monstrous visage of...
69402: The crowd erupts in mindless hysteria. Panicked pedestrians scatter;
some trip and are crushed ruthlessly underfoot.
69492: Downtown has been transformed into a killing field. Panicked pedestrians
grapple and claw at each other as they attempt to flee. Children wail as they
are dragged along by their parents. The streets are full of broken glass and
rubble, while Chickzilla's bulk blots out the sun.
69686: Our hero sits fumbling with the controls of an idling helicopter.
69736: Our hero finds his way blocked at every turn by overacting extras.
Progress is impossible. There is no escape!
69814: Our hero is dwarfed by the mammoth mountain of fearsome feathers that is
Chickzilla!
69932: Suddenly Chickzilla seems to notice the little helicopter.
69974: The monster stares curiously at the helicopter.
70010: Chickzilla starts advancing slowly towards the helicopter.
70054: Chickzilla is coming closer every second!
70086: If our hero doesn't get airborne soon he's going to be chicken-food!
70138: Chickzilla advances slowly toward the helicopter.
70176: Chickzilla is almost standing on the helicopter!
70212: A huge and beady eye suddenly appears in the helicopter windscreen.
70260: With a start, Chickzilla recognises her nemesis.
70296: The monster rears up on one foot...
70324: Too late - Chickzilla has made mincemeat of our hero, helicopter and
all!
70378: Lazily the monster steps across the road, destroying another building.
70430: Chickzilla gives her back end a slight wriggle and scratches deep
trenches in the street. Severed water pipes hiss and spray.
70520: Casually the monster devours a fleeing pedestrian.
70556: Another building crumbles under a huge scaly foot.
70592: A crazed pedestrian runs past shrieking "Abunai! Toori niku! Toori
niku!"
70696: Chickzilla lets out a deafening "Bwaark!", rattling the windows of
nearby buildings.
70758: With a thrust of the beak Chickzilla shatters a high window and plucks a
thrashing office worker from inside.
70836: Chickzilla squats low for a moment and her eyes become distant. Then
suddenly she leaps up with a triumphant cackle, revealing a blimp- sized egg
tottering atop the rubble.

Slowly the huge egg starts rolling, scraping
buildings on either side, down the street towards our hero!

>
71104: At the last second, the egg hits a lump of debris and bounces overhead,
missing our hero by millimetres. It rolls along to the harbour, where it
disappears in a spray of water.
71228: Bestiality does not make good cinema.
71256: A sudden rush of testosterone momentarily overcomes our hero's good
sense. With a whoop he leaps and scrabbles at the scaley leg of the monster.
Chickzilla gives him scornful glance as she shakes him off, to fall back into
the mindless crowd.
71424: Suddenly Chickzilla seems to notice our hero among the throng. She casts
a beady eye upon him, but just as abruptly becomes distracted.
71520: Though the sight of such enormous breasts almost overwhelms our hero, he
draws the line at smooching this particular chickadee!
71608: Our hero is captivated. He can't take his eyes from her smooth features.
The arch of her brow, the swell of her cheek, the curve of her neck. He
hungrily eyes the delicious roll of her hips, the pressure of firm flesh aching
to escape the black leather jump-suit.
71792: Part of a shredded poster blows past, showing a bottle of bright orange
liquid and the words "oku Super Growth Formul", and "hree special activator
ingredi". With another gust of wind it disappears in the chaos.
71944: Suddenly a small helicopter careens earthward, bouncing to a stop just
across the street. The helmeted pilot and a breathless cameraman tumble out,
leaving the rotors spinning in readiness for a quick departure.
72090: Removing the helmet with a flourish, the helicopter pilot shakes out her
long dark hair! Our hero watches spellbound from across the street as the
beautiful woman takes a microphone and turns to face the camera. She is
perfectly composed, despite the chaos surrounding her.
72282: Across the street the beautiful newscaster continues taping her
broadcast.
72336: Having finished her report, the woman prepares to reboard her
helicopter. Taking one last look around, her roving eyes lock with those of our
hero!
72440: Cheeks flush in the heat of that gaze.

All is silent, but for the
bass-drum beat of twin hearts and the frenzied sawing of two dozen impassioned
violins.

A pair of pouting lips parts.

Stars explode and snowy doves flap
across the face of the moon.
72620: Suddenly the world comes crashing in again, all sound and fury. A huge
beak swoops down to snatch away the goddess and her cameraman. The crowd
scatters, leaving our hero stunned and alone near the empty helicopter.
72772: But our hero can't reach her through the panicked crowd.
72812: But she is way over on the other side of the street: hundreds of
panic-stricken Orientals lie between!
72884: A quick glance reveals a black leather jump-suit, goggles, white silk
scarf, and a helmet. Just the usual. Although there do seem to be some
interesting bulges under that skin-tight black leather...
73088: The cameraman isn't really our hero's type.
73120: A small but powerful helicopter crouches across the street, it's rotors
spinning in readiness.
73188: A fuel gauge is the only thing recognisable among the gadgets and dials
inside the cockpit. A joystick with a red button sticks up between our hero's
legs.
73346: " logo on the side. The door is open, the rotors are spinning, and some
sort of metal hook is retracted up underneath.
73432: It would be suicide to leave the safety of the cockpit!
73472: Jaw set, our hero launches himself out of the helicopter. But this is
just what Chickzilla has been waiting for: one little side-step and suddenly
there is nothing for our hero to land on. The last thing that goes through his
mind as he hits the pavement far below, is his backside.
73668: Launching himself from the helicopter, our hero tumbles into the vat
below.
73724: He drowns in a chemical-induced agony. Not a pretty scene.
73768: Moments later he explodes out again a thousand times larger than before!
Chickzilla looks up from her destruction, turns deathly pale and drops an egg.
She shrieks, turns turkey, and flutters back to disappear into the bay from
where she came, dragging the beautiful reporter to a watery grave. Our hero
gives a studly smirk. Shifting his weight, he inadvertently topples a building.
He looks thoughtfully at the rubble, then experimentally pushes another. As it
crumbles, a silly smile spreads over his face. He starts stomping other
structures, slowly at first, but with increasing enthusiasm. As the credits
roll, out hero is dancing, kicking, and jumping, merrily flattening Tokyo.
74248: Heros don't gate-crash private functions - that's very bad form.
74296: Some of those animals don't look too friendly!
74332: This is no time for a swim, especially when our hero has no trunks!
74380: If you can't beat 'em, join 'em! Hero and Love Interest splat on the
ground like a pair of ripe pomegranates. Chickzilla raises her head high and
lets out a deafening cackle - the world is now at her mercy!
74528: The words are lost in the whine of the helicopter.
74564: Little can be heard over the whine of the helicopter.
74604: Our hero can't reach the helicopter: a panicked crowd blocks the way.
74656: Our hero leaps into the helicopter cockpit and fumbles with the safety
belt.
74708: If only he could figure out how to fly this thing...
74748: Fuel continues to pour out of a bullet hole in the side of the
helicopter.
74870: The fuel gauge, though nearly full, has started to drop slowly.
74918: The fuel gauge shows 3/4 and falling...
74952: The fuel gauge edges down over 1/2.
74980: The fuel gauge now shows only 1/4 full!
75012: A red light on the fuel gauge starts blinking.
75046: The red light on the fuel gauge blinks faster!
75082: Somewhere an alarm starts beeping in time with the blinking fuel light.
75134: BEEP!

The engine gives a splutter.
75168: BEEP BEEP BEEP!

The helicopter coughs and jerks, but somehow keeps
running.
75232: BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP! The buzzer and fuel light are going crazy!
75288: BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP! The light on the fuel gauge bursts apart with
a tiny explosion. The helicopter engine gives one last cough and stops
completely. Our hero struggles frantically with the joystick as the nose drops
and the whole aircraft suddenly plummets earthward.

A fireball lights up the
Tokyo skyline, while in the distance Chickzilla can be heard cackling in
triumph.
75566: {I}Slowly coming to your senses, you realise that your sweaty neighbour
has been clutching at your arm in terror. You hurridly fend off the unwanted
attention, but not before an explosion of giggles from the back row announces
that somebody noticed.
75748: The joystick emerges from the floor between our hero's feet. As he grips
it with one hand, his thumb lies over a red button.
75836: The helicopter lurches but remains firmly rooted to the ground.
75880: Like a falcon unmasked, the helicopter leaps into the air. Wrestling the
controls, our perspiring hero careens skyward, only narrowly avoiding the
snatching of Chickzilla's deadly beak.

As he passes, our hero glimpses the
beautiful reporter, clinging precariously to the monster's dangling comb! Then
she is gone, left far below as he soars into the open skies...
76140: The button is labelled "Grapple".
76168: A whirr and an insubstantial clunk can be heard from beneath the
helicopter.
76220: A flashing red light warns our hero not to fly any higher.
76260: There doesn't seem to be anything interesting down there.
76300: The endless city of Tokyo stretches out below. To the
76382: With a touch of the joystick the helicopter thunders through the sky...
76436: The helicopter hangs in the sky high above downtown. The endless city of
Tokyo stretches to the horizon in all directions
76520: , but a few major landmarks are visible. To the north-east lies a patch
of green, while sunlight shimmers on the ocean to the south-east. The buildings
to the south are particularly grand, but those to the west are not, and the
smog is thickest to the north-west. Below, Chickzilla continues to crush
citizens and crumble buildings.

It has taken our hero just seconds to master
control of the helicopter. He can now guide it remarkably smoothly in any
compass direction, as well as up and down.
76904: From a distance, Chickzilla looks much more realistic. But now the city
looks to be made from cardboard and balsa.
76984: Chickzilla is too far away for that.
77012: The helicopter dips and dives just above the huge head of Chickzilla.
The whirr of the rotors seems to enrage her, and she snaps at it with her
massive beak. With every movement, the beautiful reporter loses more of her
precarious hold on the monster's comb!
77192: The beautiful heroine falls towards her doom!
77224: Our hero seems paralysed by the sight of the woman falling to her death!
77276: Chickzilla would surely catch our hero if he flew any closer.
77320: From above, Chickzilla looks much more realistic. Unfortunately the city
looks almost like it is made of cardboard, cut out and glued together.
77420: This has no effect, however, on the grim visage of our hero: a close-up
reveals the beautiful reporter dangling desperately from the monsters rubbery
comb!
77528: An expanse of striped canvas blinds the monster, rendering her immobile.
77580: Chickzilla darts at the helicopter, but it is too high.
77620: Chickzilla gives her back end a slight wriggle and scratches at the
street with one massive foot.
77688: Chickzilla plucks a thrashing victim from the streets below, and
swallows him in one gulp.
77752: A flick of one massive foot shatters another building.
77792: A dark sedan appears in the street below. It glides to a stop and two
people emerge. The man is lean and dark-haired, while the woman has light
auburn hair to her shoulders. Both wear dark overcoats and reflective
sunglasses. They gaze a minute at Chickzilla, before engaging in a heated
discussion. The words "alien conspiracy" drift up from the man, while the woman
mutters "some reasonable explanation". Just then Chickzilla stomps them both
into bloody smears.
78120: Since meeting the burning gaze of his leather-clad reporter, our hero
has eyes for no other.
78184: Far below, atop a hotel tower, a crystal swimming pool blinks in the
sunlight. Off to the north, a monstrous chicken is tumbling buildings and
ripping up pavements.
78300: The helicopter hovers just above the top of the hotel tower.
78344: Wind from the rotors fans waves on the swimming pool and buffets the
canvas marquee erected next to it. A few guests in formal dress emerge from the
tent to wave their fists angrily.
78468: Angry guests mill about among the overturned tables where their marquee
formerly stood.
78528: A mass of canvas dangles limply beneath the helicopter.
78568: A mass of striped canvas, the remains of a marquee, hangs below the
helicopter. One particularly tenacious party guest still clings to a tattered
corner.
78676: The hotel has obviously been booked out for some special occasion, as a
huge striped tent has been set up atop the hotel roof next to the swimming
pool.
78780: There's a whirr and a clunk and a huge ripping noise. The tattered
remains of the marquee dangle below the helicopter.
78862: The huge mass of striped canvas drifts gently down, fanning out like a
parachute. Miraculously it settles right over the head of the beastly
bird!

Blindfolded, Chickzilla freezes. She stands stock still as an eerie
silence grows. The survivors in the streets below turn to look upward, where a
single high-pitched scream cuts through the atmosphere...

The beautiful
reporter has finally lost her grip and is falling (in slow-motion) toward the
hard grey pavement below!
79196: A gust of wind catches the falling marquee. It drifts earthward and is
lost.

A commotion breaks out on the roof below, centred around an intimidating
woman clutching a chihuahua. She has cornered the hotel manager and proceeds to
berate him with indignant getures in the direction of the helicopter.
79404: A gust of wind catches the falling marquee. It drifts earthward and is
lost.
79460: The large woman clutches her chihuahua, oblivious to all but her
unfortunate audience.
79520: A woman clutching a tiny dog stands berating the hotel manager.
79566: A tiny chihuahua dangles by the scruff of its neck from the grappling
hand, yapping and snarling.
79636: The woman has bailed the hotel manager up in a corner and is showing no
mercy. Her little bundle of joy, a tiny chihuahua, stares up at the helicopter,
snarling.
79748: The tiny chihuahua snarls menacingly and gives a high-pitched yap.
79796: The wildly swinging grapple-arm narrowly misses grasping the chihuahua,
which snarls and yaps even more violently.
79876: The wildly swinging grapple-arm snatches closed on the tiny chihuahua,
whisking it from the grasp of the shrieking Madame. She faints in the direction
of the nearby hotel manager, who deftly steps aside.
80020: The snarling chihuahua falls towards the monster like a tiny bomb.
Chickzilla bats it harmlessly aside with one wing and glares contemptuously at
the helicopter that bobs just out of reach.
80152: The snarling chihuahua lands safely atop the hotel. The guests scatter
from the snarling bundle of malice; all except its adoring owner who runs
forward to catch it up in a stifling embrace. Moving quickly, she cuts off the
hotelier's escape and continues badgering him with many angry gestures at the
helicopter.
80368: The tiny chihuahua lands safely aboard the ship and promptly attaches
itself to the ankle of a seaman. Another sailor tries to dislodge it by
flailing wildly with an oar, but only succeeds in hitting everyone else.
Finally a lucky sweep collects the snarling bundle of hate and sends it arcing
across the water like a golf ball, to disappear in the distance with a silent
splash.
80628: The snarling chihuahua falls into the bay and disappears. Wrathful
bubbles continue to surface for several minutes.
80708: The snarling chihuahua lands safely among the bewildered zoo animals. In
seconds the African Collection lies slaughtered, and only a quick-thinking
zoo-keeper with a dart gun saves the Reptiles Of The World.
80856: The snarling chihuahua drops soundlessly into the vat. Seconds later,
the orange liquid begins to boil furiously.

A huge paw emerges from the
maelstrom and is drawn back.

A massive ear appears and resubmerges.

The
ripples die away and all is quiet. Suddenly a gigantic chihuahua explodes from
the vat! It lets out a deep rumbling snarl, the force of which sends the
helicopter spinning across town...
81142: (in the helicopter)
Our hero regains control to find himself hovering
within striking range of Chickzilla! But she cares little for him now - she has
been challenged! With a deafening screech she lunges at the monstrous
chihuahua.

The beautiful reporter is tossed to one side, and tumbles (in
slow-motion) toward the hard grey pavement far far below!
81392: The snarling chihuahua drops like a stone into the city below.
81436: A patch of green far below indicates Ueno Park with its zoo. To the
south-west Chickzilla continues to demolish downtown Tokyo.
81528: Miscellaneous animals cower in terror from the helicopter.
81608: One of the most dangerous animals in the zoo, the ravenous bird blatter
beast comes all the way from the Transvaal.
81688: The grue is shrouded in a long black coat, dark shades, and plenty of
zinc sunscreen.
81872: with a casual flick of her beak. If only it had been bigger it might
have been a match for her.
82228: There is a rumble and a bubble, but it never resurfaces.
82268: The liquid bubbles and rumbles violently as a massively enlarged leg
appears briefly above the surface. Suddenly the liquid gives an almighty belch
as a hideously deformed shape is spat out. It lies quivering for a moment
before dissolving away down a sewer drain.
82448: The liquid bubbles and rumbles violently as first leg and then a head,
both massively enlarged, appears briefly above the surface. Suddenly the liquid
gives an almighty belch as a hideously deformed shape is spat out. It lies
quivering for a moment before exploding in chunks of raw flesh.
82732: But that's outside the helicopter, out of reach.
82988: nibbles delicately at the finger foods. Alas! The salmon dip has turned!
The
83216: tumbles into the vat with a wet smack. The liquid bubbles violently,
then goes perfectly still.

Suddenly a massive
83300: explodes out of the vat. Towering over the city, it blinks and looks
around. Its dewy eyes meet those of Chickzilla and for a moment time seems to
stand still. Then Chickzilla screeches and attacks! Tactfully, the camera looks
away during several minutes of intense sound effects, and when it turns back
Chickzilla is once again demolishing downtown, a mountain of bloodstained fluff
to one side.
83616: But that's outside the helicopter, out of reach.
83684: He seems surprised to find he has unwittingly become a movie star. But
he's sure going to make the most of the opportunity.
83772: Really, he's not our hero's type. In fact, poor Cornbred probably isn't
anybody's type.
83840: A whirr and a clunk, and Cornbred struggles in the grip of a metal hand.
83892: falls through the air, looking mildly annoyed. He flaps his arms
briskly, but it doesn't seem to help much.
84058: Centigrade sticks in the throat: Chickzilla is choking! She lurches
around for a several agonising minutes before finally toppling, dead, on the
rubble-strewn street.

Alas! The beautiful reporter has been crushed beneath
the dead monster, but out of its gaping beak crawls Cornbred, unharmed and
triumphant!
84276: He lands safely amid the startled partygoers, who, on recognising him,
promptly drown him in the pool.
84348: He lands safely aboard the ship, and chases the crew twice around the
deck before they manage to drive him overboard with a boat-hook.
84444: Just before he hits the ocean a huge firey hand emerges, snatches him,
and drags him under the waves.
84516: He lands safely among the other animals, which proceed to kill him in
their terror.
84576: He lands in the vat with a plop, and disappears below the surface.
84624: Presently, he bobs to the surface, places a clothes-peg on his nose, and
gives an astounding performance of water ballet. Emerging to thunderous
applause, he bows gracefully left and right before sloping off into the city,
leaving a trail of damp footprints.
84804: As he lands in the vat the surface goes deathly still.

Suddenly a huge
Cornbred explodes out of the vat. Towering over the city, he shakes himself off
and looks around. His eyes meet those of Chickzilla and there is a moment of
such tension that time almost seems to hiccup to a stop. Then a crafty smile
steals over Cornbred's gigantic visage. Chickzilla cackles, and together they
continue kicking over Tokyo. Almost as an afterthought Cornbred reaches over
and casually flicks our hero's helicopter out of the sky. Looks like it's
curtains for Tokyo.
85196: Still flapping, he disappears into the city below. He reappears seconds
later, bouncing up to do a goodbye triple-flip, before trampolining off towards
solo stardom.
85312: But he's outside the helicopter!
85336: The glittering waters of Tokyo Bay, dotted with ships, stretch out to
the south and east, while buildings crowd the shores. A trail of destruction
leads north-west.
85452: That way lies the Pacific - no place for a helicopter with limited fuel!
85504: Wind from the rotors kicks up a ring of spray. The helicopter hovers
just above a small ship, on which
85576: can be seen two large crates. The bow of a small life boat protrudes
from between the crates. Several seamen gesture angrily at the helicopter.
85676: remains one large crate, and nestled beside it a small life boat. The
crew shout and curse our hero, shaking their fists.
85760: crew are getting ugly. Though they throw deadly squid meat at our hero,
it glances harmlessly off the helicopter.
85840: The ship is much too big to do anything with.
85872: A large crate swings leisurely beneath the helicopter.
85912: Bold lettering proclaims: "Noodles, Wun Tun".
85976: The falling crate smashes open on the head of Chickzilla. For a moment
she wobbles in place and it looks almost as if she will fall. But then her eyes
clear and she glares up at the helicopter hovering just out of reach above her.
86136: The crate falls, narrowly missing the rooftop, to crash open on the
street below.
86196: The crate is safely deposited back aboard the ship.
86232: The falling crate disappears into the ocean with a splash.
86272: The edgy animals attack, splintering the crate and scattering noodles
over a wide radius.
86336: The crate disappears into the vat with a smack.
86420: The falling crate smashes open on the city streets below.
86460: A small boat dangles beneath the helicopter.
86494: A leaky lifeboat bobs in the centre of the swimming pool.
86538: A small lifeboat sits on the ship.
86568: It is full of sparkling pool water.
86640: . The helicopter's grapple hook firmly grasps the bench which
86684: With a clink the grappling hand grasps the rowing bench in the middle of
the lifeboat.
86744: The spinning life boat lands upside-down on Chickzilla's head, covering
her eyes. For a moment she seems paralysed, but then with a shake she sends the
boat crashing to the street below.
86876: The lifeboat lands directly in the centre of the swimming pool and
promptly fills with sparkling water.
86948: The lifeboat thuds back aboard the ship, flattening an unlucky sailor.
87000: The lifeboat smacks into the water, bobs for a second, and then sinks
like a stone.
87060: The lifeboat lands upside-down near a giant tortoise, who, mistaking it
for another giant tortoise, tries to mate with it. Much to his disappointment
the hull collapses under his weight.
87192: The boat drops into the bubbling vat, overturns, and disappears.
87268: The lifeboat smashes to pieces on the city streets.
87304: A thick layer of smog, belched from a thousand chimneys, hazes the
industrial zone below the bobbing helicopter. Chickzilla continues her rampage
to the south-east.
87420: cough and wriggle. The grapple loses it's grip, and the
87492: Three large tanks stand among the maze of pipes, drains, and chimneys
that form the "Doku Pharmaceuticals" factory below. Noxious fumes of
87636: liquid churns and bubbles in the vat below. Signs on the surrounding
fence warn:

 DANGER!
 Raw Unactivated Growth Hormone
 May Cause Itching or
Death 
 Keep Clear
87908: This is a particularly shabby section of the city. Shadowy forms can be
seen skulking in the narrow alleys far below, and a giant chicken cackles from
the east.
88020: No way! Our hero isn't stupid enough to go down there again!
88064: It looks dangerous down there. For an instant our hero hesitates: should
he really go down there? (Y/N) >
88144: With a thrust of the joystick the helicopter drops to skim the
roof-tops.

Abruptly, the movement in the alleys increases - shouts and bullets
fill the air. Our hero pulls up sharply, but too late - a bullet has holed the
fuel tank! A stream of liquid pours from the bullet hole, and the fuel gauge
begins to drop more rapidly.
88376: Tokyo stretches endlessly to the hazy horizons. Chickzilla's head can be
seen bobbing above the rooftops to the north-east. The helicopter hovers over a
wide roof in which is a small skylight.

{I}Suddenly the soundtrack swells and
the helicopter noise drowns out the background music. You and your sweaty
neighbour swap questioning glances in the half-light.
88632: Through the small skylight come irregular flashes of light.
88674: With a whirr the grapple arm drops, shattering the skylight and
disappearing into the darkness below.
88748: You look up with a start as shards of broken glass fall into your
popcorn. A mechanical hand dangles through a previously unnoticed skylight in
the roof of the cinema. It drops to hover just overhead, and makes an
ineffectual snatch at your cowering neighbour. Snatching a second time it
manages to grab you by the back of your collar, and before you can even demand
to see the manager you are whisked up and out into the sky.

The city spreads
out like a blanket before you as you are carried along beneath a small black
helicopter. Flying into into a particularly smoggy part of the city, you dangle
for a moment above a huge vat in which
89186: liquid bubbles. But the helicopter pilot appears to change his mind, and
whisks you off again.

You start to get an uncomfortable feeling underneath the
popcorn in the bottom of your stomach: up ahead a hugely overgrown chicken is
tearing up the city. The helicopter halts just above the watchful fowl and
suddenly the metal hand holds you no longer. As you fall you can't help feeling
that there is something not quite fair in all of this. At the edge of your
hearing you almost think you can make out the sniggering of a couple of
teenagers and the wondering gasp of an overweight slob.

This is not exactly
how you thought the movie would end. In fact, as surprise endings go it's
pretty impressive.

You never hit the ground. Chickzilla eats you.
89712: Thrusting the joystick, our hero tips his helicopter into a steep dive.
Using all the forces of gravity and whining rotors he drives the screaming
machine groundward at maximum speed. He reaches the falling beauty just metres
above the pavement...
89884: The ground is approaching FAST!
89912: This close to the ground, the only way is up.
89944: Somehow she still manages to look alluring, even as she plummets to her
death.
89998: The woman continues to plummet earthward.
90030: Too late! There is a sickening thud as the woman splatters over the
downtown pavement.
90096: Disaster! The marquee has slipped, and Chickzilla is freed from her
paralysis.
90156: Meanwhile Chickzilla has disposed of her giant adversary, and turns her
attention to the helicopter hovering helplessly nearby.
90244: A huge wing darts out, batting the helicopter against the side of a
building - it explodes in a ball of flame, incinerating our hero.

Chickzilla
raises her beak to the sky and cackles in triumph. The world is now at her
mercy!
90404: A whirr and a clunk and the beautiful reporter is snatched from her doom
by the closing of a metal hand!

Another wrench of the joystick brings the
helicopter shrieking and grinding out of its desperate dive, and catapults it
back into the sky. But wait -
90734: lunges at the helicopter. Our hero gets a close-up view of a razor-sharp
beak as it snatches for him...

>
90816: It missed! The bird missed! The helicopter spins out of control.
Shearing sideways, the rotors slice neatly through the neck of the monster.
Hero and reporter are flung from the wreck, crashing through the skylight of a
nearby building.

Chickzilla's head thumps to the ground, but the headless body
doesn't remain standing still for long. Spouting blood, it runs blindly among
the buildings, unwittingly retracing its own steps back to the harbour.
Crashing into the water, it stirs up seaweed, capsizes a ship laden with
noodles, and sends a dockside chilli warehouse sliding into the sea. Its
thrashing and churning heats the waters almost to boiling point, and as the
death-throes gradually subside a wonderful, piquant aroma slowly spreads across
the city...
91348: It is sunset. Our hero and his beautiful companion stand side-by-side on
an amber-bathed rooftop overlooking the bay. Their clothes are alluringly torn,
and feathers still cling to their hair. Nearby, a neon sign buzzes lazily over
the distant shouts of excited children as they run to fill bowls from the edge
of the harbour.

As the ruby sun slowly sinks they lean closer.
91612: A glorious sunset blazes out over Tokyo Bay. The rooftop is bathed in
shades of red and gold, while a neon sign flashes green.
91794: From the harbour a familiar fragrance wafts over the city.

{I}From your
obese neighbour a flagrant odour wafts through the theatre.
91896: Why go somewhere else when everything's perfect right here?
91940: The neon sign flashes "Katakunai Pillow Factory". Other signs light up
the surrounding buildings.
92058: ' Us", "Makoto's Broken Glass Emporium", and "Atshushi's Pets -
Specialists in Hedgehogs and Porcupines".
92144: Wisps of downy feathers cling to the couple, though it is hard to say
whether they originate from the vanquished monster or from the pillow storeroom
in which they landed.
92260: The woman stands close, almost but not quite touching our hero. She
gazes dreamily out into the setting sun.
92340: Proximity, and the light of the setting sun, make her lovelier than
ever. Our hero feels a great swelling inside. This must be love...
92436: A solid slap on the face restores some manners to our hero.
92480: There's only room in this movie for one star. A quick shove sends her
shrieking to the streets far, far below. And there's time for one more studly
pose before the credits roll...
92608: The gentle press of a slender finger seals our hero's lips. Now is not a
time for idle chatter.
92676: Violins soar as lips meet. The focus softens as the last light of day
leaves the sky. One by one, lights begin to shine out from the city below,
mirroring those in the heavens above...
92806: It is sunset. Our hero and Cornbred Centigrade stand side-by-side on an
amber-bathed rooftop overlooking the bay.

As the ruby sun slowly sinks,
Cornbred gloats mercilessly about killing the monster. "What's the matter,
Hero-Boy? Can't handle a little competition?"
93008: A glorious sunset blazes out over Tokyo Bay. The rooftop is bathed in
shades of red and gold.
93076: Maybe suicide is not such a bad option after all. A quick leap, and
suddenly it's done. The pavement looks strangely inviting as it rushes up to
meet our hero...
93192: There doesn't seem to be any way off the rooftop.
93228: Cornbred slouches at the roof-edge, smirking. He's making the most of
stealing the limelight.
93296: How could you even THINK of that!?
93370: centigrade plunge to his doom on the hard street below. Somehow it seems
a fit ending.
93432: Not on your life! That way madness lies.
93464: Smooth of face and square of jaw, our man is set apart by his
penetrating blue eyes and keen intellect. He is clearly a force to be reckoned
with.
93572: A true hero doesn't need to cart useless junk around wherever he goes.
93676: {I}You can't help wondering why you bought this soggy mess, let alone
the "Monster Tub" size.
93748: {I}A barrage of stony glances shoots your way. The teenagers in the back
row snigger.
93812: {I}A heavy hand grabs your shoulder from behind, and you are blinded by
a torch shone into your eyes. The burly usher escorts you from the premises,
much to the amusement of the teenagers in the back row.
94056: Our man is equipped with strong hands, a nimble mind, and an oversized
jaw. What more can a hero need?
94130: {I}As the lights come back on and the audience gets up to leave you
can't help wondering at the strange ending. Why couldn't the hero save his love
interest and conquer Chickzilla?

Maybe if you sat through the next showing it
would all become clear.

Or maybe next time around things would go
differently...
94356: {I}The light outside is dazzling.

A surly usher in a shiny waistcoat
pretends to smile as you walk past,

down the stairs,

and back into the real
world...
94480: {I}Your sleazy advances are ignored by the blubbery bulk in the next
seat. It doesn't look like you'll score tonight.
95336: The End.
95986: No chickens were harmed in the creation of this game.
96034: MEANWHILE...

Not far away something disturbs the calm waters of Tokyo
Bay.
Slowly, the tip of an enormous pink snout emerges to sniff the air.

It
smells like Party Time!


DON'T MISS:
96564: How much more ham can you take?!
96588: Coming soon to a screen near you!
96880: PORKZILLA: How much more ham can you take?!
96922: Coming soon to a screen near you!
97016: Our hero's grasp of the Japanese language is obviously poor!
97060: Maybe you could be a little more specific.
97092: Maybe you could be a little more specific.
97124: Just because our hero can fly this thing doesn't mean he can land it!
97172: {I}If you wanted porn' you should have gone next door to "Dierdre Does
Dalmations".
97240: {I}Maybe it's time you went on a diet. This popcorn isn't helping
matters you know...
97308: That can't be done, at least not here.
97336: That's not something a true hero would do.
97368: This game is permanently set in "verbose" mode.
97404: Our hero would laugh in the face of danger - "Haha!", only it's not
cool.
97668: 1] is back!
And it's bigger than ever!
Featuring all new scenes rescued
from the cutting room floor! Don't miss:


   {B}DOWNTOWN TOKYO. PRESENT DAY. 

 Release II: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT{B}
97850: The critics praised Release I:
"Small, but perfectly formed - and it's
getting a perfect 10 from me" - Jane Kerr
"Manages to firmly entertain, as well
as break new ground" - Lucian Paul Smith
"Tokyo has some surprises up its
sleeve" - Paul O'Brian
"'Sgood stuff" - Dan Shiovitz
"Very clever... The pacing
is excellent" - bones
"Yay!" - Michael Straight
"Cheesy, silly" - Suzanne
Skinner
"Short, cute... Very witty" - Mark Musante
"Ah, now I _like_ this!" -
Roger Burton West
"My favourite in the competition" - Stephen
Griffiths
"Satisfyingly satirical" - Carl Muckenhoupt
"A hell of a lot of
fun... Features what may well be the best XYZZY response ever" - Adam Cadre
99218: grove, Shona Lamoureaux, Gillian Dennis, Michael Kinyon, and Mark The
Mark for beta-testing;

Evin Robertson, Stephen Granade, Cody Sandifer, Ben
Hines, and Neil Cerutti for bug reports;

all those involved in Competition 98,
but especially it's organiser, David Dyte, and those who donated prizes;

and,
of course, Graham Nelson for Inform.

Without their efforts, this game would
have been even worse than it already is.
99618: om.

Please note that this game contains no bugs, only "features".
Nevertheless, "feature" reports will be gratefully received, along with
comments, critisms, fan mail, lacy underwear, etc.
99756: Release 1 / Serial number 980930
- Version released for the 1998
Interactive Fiction Competition.
99838: "The Director's Cut"
- Minor bug fixes, additions to the info menu.
-
Lots of new things to do, especially in Scene 2.
99932: This game is distributed as freeware, which means it should cost you
nothing - if you paid anything for it you have been ripped off, sucker! It also
means that the author gets nothing out of it. If, however, you would like to
make some small contribution to the author, then please name your first-born
after him (McWiggle is such a nice name, especially for a girl).

Being
freeware, it is illegal to modify this game, or use it for commercial gain. It
also illegal to discharge it from a grassy knoll. If swallowed, induce vomiting
and seek medical advice immediately.
100332: Any similarities between this game and certain cult movies is purely
coincidental. The author has never seen any movie set in Japan, nor (with the
exception of the "Die Hard" series) any starring a grotesquely overgrown
animal. In fact, the author has absolutely no idea if this game resembles
anything at all, including interactive fiction. Actually, one possible scene in
"Tokyo" is fairly similar something in Infocom's "Hollywood Hijinx". That
really was a coincidence - the author didn't play that game until after writing
the relevant scene in this game. They say that great minds think alike, but I
guess it really just goes to show that you should never mess with small baldy
dogs.
100816: You choose the course of this game by entering simple commands, to
which the game responds. Commands should be typed at the ">" prompt, and
executed by pressing the ENTER key.

Some of the commands you might use when
playing the game include LOOK, EXAMINE, GO, PUSH, PULL, GET IN, GET OUT, EAT,
SMELL, FLY, and SPANK NANNY WITH THE WET FISH. The game also understands many
other commands, so use your imagination.

You may also UNDO a turn, SAVE your
position, RESTORE a saved position, RESTART the game, or QUIT your job and join
a hippy commune in the woods.
101280: In most adventure games, YOU are the hero. YOU give the fried egg to
the monk, YOU operate the Babel fish dispenser, and YOU have YOUR cardigan
laughed at by space aliens.

In this game, however, you actually play two
people - one is the real you, sitting in the dark in a movie theatre, and the
other is the hero of the film that you are watching. Most of the commands you
type will affect the way in which the movie hero acts, but a few act on the
real you (have you tried swearing, or typing "score"?).
101644: {B}Warning:{B} The following gives one step-by-step solution (the
easiest) to the game, though there are several others. Make extra sure you
really want to spoil the game for yourself before pressing ENTER.
102048: Damn! That didn't fool you. Well, don't say I didn't try to stop you...
102104: PROLOGUE: examine soup, wait (until foot appears), examine foot.
102156: SCENE 1: wait (until pilot removes her helmet), examine woman, get in
helicopter, pull joystick.
102232: SCENE 2: fly south, down, push button, north, down, push button, down,
push button, (anything).
102308: Aw! Not the last scene too - that's the best bit!
102348: SCENE 3: kiss woman.
102368: Oh, so you want more! Too bad - you'll just have to go and find your
own alternative solution.
102436: Have you tried the following:
102692: typing "SMELL" in scene 3?
102740: saying "XYZZY"?
102792: See if you can:
102804: re-enact a scene from "Indiana Jones"
102900: witness the final episode of "The X-Files"
103028: Patience is a virtue.
103044: Things will start to happen at some stage.
103076: In the meantime, have you had a good look at everything?
103116: I mean everything.
103132: Especially the soup.
103148: Did you read the newspaper at the beginning?
103180: It's really no sillier than your average Hollywood plot-line.
103224: Have you looked at the controls?
103248: The joystick seems promising.
103272: Maybe if you push or pull it.
103296: Now you can explore a bit - maybe you'll find something useful.
103344: Have you figured out what that button on the joystick does?
103388: Maybe if you were hovering over top of something when you pushed it.
103436: You should be able to find your way back to downtown alright.
103480: Did you find the zoo to the north-east of downtown?
103516: Or the harbour to the south-east of downtown?
103548: There's also a hotel south of downtown.
103576: And the ghetto to the west.
103596: Not to mention the factory to the north-west.
103688: You have to defeat Chickzilla.
103712: There are several ways of doing this.
103740: Four, in fact.
103752: You might want to experiment with moving things around the city.
103796: Look out for anything that might be useful for subduing a bird.
103840: Or maybe creating a suitable adversary.
103868: You could throw a big party!
103888: But there's more important things to do right now.
103924: Maybe you could cover something up.
103952: How do you subdue a bird?
103972: They normally calm down a bit in the dark.
104004: I guess you could cover it's eyes.
104032: Hey, maybe that tent could be of some use after all!
104072: Have you heard of healthy eating?
104096: Carbohydrates are a major food group.
104124: Complex carbohydrates are found in starchy foods, like potato, or
pasta...
104192: There are three crates of noodles on a ship in Tokyo Bay.
104236: Hydrocarbons are high in energy.
104260: That's why they are often used for fuel.
104292: There's no fuel to be picked up around Tokyo.
104328: But you ARE carrying some with you.
