87568: Digging would achieve nothing here.
87596: There's nothing suitable to drink here.

89544: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
89612: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
89652: The game file has verified as intact.
89680: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupt.
89724: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
89886: It's your first day on the job at the Speedy Express delivery company,
and there's one last batch of cargo to be delivered before you can call it a
day. You start to wonder whether you followed the directions correctly when the
road dead-ends at a large body of water. Then you remember the shift
supervisor's parting words as you pulled out of the warehouse this morning: "By
the way, you do know how to row, don't you?"
90188: It's an oar. For rowing. Bigger than a wooden spoon, smaller than... a
giant wooden spoon.
90256: You're at the southern shore of a wide river which runs east to west as
far as you can see. A stretch of fine sand here makes for a scenic, if narrow,
beach. A wooden dock extends out several feet from the beach into the water.
Across the river, a hundred yards or so to the north, you can just make out the
far shore. To the south is the road you drove in on, your delivery van parked
off on the shoulder.
90540: Unless you can walk on water, you'll have to find another way across.
90592: You can't go any further inland while you're in the boat.
90636: You've got a job to do -- better stick around until you've completed
your delivery.
90696: You've reached the northern shore of the river. The beach, smaller and
rockier than at the other shore, quickly gives way to a forest on its north
side. A dock similar to the one on the south shore juts out into the water.
Nailed to a thick tree at the edge of the forest is a small sign, marking the
beginning of an overgrown country lane which leads north through the trees.
90956: Unless you can walk on water, you'll have to find another way across.
91008: You can't go any further inland while you're in the boat.
91052: Based on the condition of the driveway, it doesn't look like the owner
is expecting any visitors.
91120: South of you is the nearest shore; the river deepens to the north.
91168: You're halfway across the river, equidistant from the north and south
shores. A cool breeze blows across the water giving you a pleasant chill.
91268: If you had an anchor (and no delivery to make), you'd drop it here and
enjoy the peace and quiet.
91416: To the north you can see the shore. South takes you back to open water.
91468: A young red fox. Its fur is soft and shimmers slightly in the bright
afternoon sun.
91528: Taken. As you pick it up, the fox huddles close to your body like a
faithful pet to its owner.
91596: Removed. As you pick it up, the fox huddles close to your body like a
faithful pet to its owner.
91664: Your average white-feathered, orange-billed waterfowl. It walks like a
duck, swims like a duck, quacks like a duck... and, you suspect, tastes like a
duck (with sufficient exposure to heat and some orange sauce).
91816: How would you like it if someone starting pulling things off of *your*
body?
91872: SLURRRRRRRP! Tastes like... chicken?!
91912: You fold the duck's head underneath its wing. It briefly falls asleep,
but wakes up after having a nightmare about being forced to wear a little blue
sailor's outfit.
92028: You pick up the duck and toss it skyward.
92058: It flaps its wings a few times and then glides back down to the ground.
92284: You grab the duck as it swims by and put in back in the boat with you.
92332: You swim after it to make sure nothing bad happens.
92372: A large burlap sack full of grain.
92448: The material is thin and is already worn from sliding around in the back
of the van. If you're not careful, you might end up with a hole in the bottom.
92556: You don't think the customer would be pleased to find his package open.
92608: As you make a hole in the bottom of the sack, a small pile of grain
falls to the ground.
92672: You quickly set the sack back down, covering the hole so you don't lose
any more grain.
92736: You quickly cover the hole so you don't lose any more grain.
92780: You don't want to make the hole any bigger; you've already lost enough
grain as it is.
92844: If you pick up the sack now, the rest of the grain will spill out of the
hole.
92900: You slip the invoice into the hole in the sack. The weight of the grain
holds it in place, blocking the opening and preventing any more grain from
falling out.
93012: A small pile of grain from the larger sack.
93042: The duck nibbles politely at the pile of grain.
93080: The duck pecks furiously at the pile of grain.
93116: The duck sniffs curiously at the pile of grain.
93152: A slip of paper which details your current delivery.
93648: Tied to one post of the dock is a rowboat.
93680: An old metal rowboat, rickety but seaworthy, with a wooden oar attached
to each side.
93740: A length of rope is tied to the bow.
93884: You need both hands to row. You'll have to drop everything first.
93932: Company policy prohibits you from transporting two pieces of cargo at
once.
94092: You prepare to shove off, but the fox doesn't seem comfortable with the
idea of water travel. It nervously skitters around in boat before finally
jumping back out onto the shore.
94216: You can't get out of the boat until you reach land.
94252: The duck appears to be tired of all the back-and-forth travel. It hops
out of the boat and sits stubbornly on the shore.
94338: The duck appears to be tired of all the back-and-forth travel. It hops
out of the boat and sits stubbornly on the shore.
94428: It is made of twisted little threads, all alike.
94464: Your SpeedEx(TM) delivery van. Unfortunately, it's not an amphibious
model, so you can't take it any further than this shore.
94560: You'd best complete your delivery first.
94592: You didn't drive all the way out here just to pack up and go home.
94640: The dock is made of parallel wooden planks supported by thick round
posts which have been sunk deep into the ground. A few of the planks look newer
than the others and may have been replaced. You can picture young children
sitting here, perhaps with fishing poles, their bare feet dangling into the
water below.
94854: A rowboat is tied to one of its posts.
94886: A length of rope is tied to one of its posts.
94924: This dock is more worn than the other one. Several of the planks are
cracked, though the sturdy wood shows no signs of breaking any time soon.
95022: A rowboat is tied to one of its posts.
95054: A length of rope is tied to one of its posts.
95092: It's a big evergreen tree. Needles, branches, bark -- the whole pine
yards.
95148: A wide river, clear and calm. It's perfect for all kinds of water
activities.
95204: You'll have to get out of the boat first.
95236: If you jump out now, you won't be able to climb back into the boat.
95284: There's no way you can swim with that heavy sack tied to you.
95328: The fox refuses to follow you into the water.
95400: You're already swimming. Just say where you want to go.
95440: You take a sip of the cool river water. Aaahhhh... refreshing.
95488: As a new employee, you received the only uniform anyone could find on
short notice: a bright orange jumpsuit left over from the days of a previous
branding campaign. It's a roomy one-piece with the company logo embroidered on
the front pocket and the words "ORANGE YOU GLAD YOU USED SPEEDY?" printed in
large letters across the back. Wearing it, you feel less like a delivery person
than a convict with corporate sponsorship.
95800: You're pretty sure it's against company policy to make deliveries in the
nude.
95856: You attempt to put the duck down the front of your jumpsuit, but the
resulting kicks and squawks convince you that it's a bad idea.
95948: The sack is much too large. If you want to play Santa, try a pillow
instead.
96004: You're afraid you won't be able to find it in there if you need it
again.
96056: You gently tuck the young fox into the front of your jumpsuit. It seems
content to stay nestled there with its head just peeking out of the top.
96156: A scrap of wood with the number 47 hand-painted in a rustic script.
(Hey, at least it's not Comic Sans.) Scrawled in fading pencil beneath the
number are the words "Drop Deliveries Here".
96296: The nail is embedded deep into the tree, and has been for some time.
It's not coming out.
96360: It's barely more than two ruts in the dirt.
96392: Just say which direction you want to go.
96420: You'll have to get into the boat first.
96448: A hollow voice says, "I pity the fool who uses lame magic words."
96496: A hollow voice sighs, "Especially that one."
96532: The duck objects. Strenuously. You take some time and reconsider, and
decide not to push the issue.
96604: That's not something you can walk on.
96660: You can't get out of the boat until you reach land.
96724: The duck swims gracefully beside you.
96808: and try to stop the carnage, but it's too late. By the time you reach
them, all that's left of the duck is a pile of white feathers.
96960: waddle over to the sack of grain. Suddenly it pokes its bill through the
thin burlap and begins devouring the grain as it pours out. Before you can
intervene, the sack is full of holes and the remaining product is scattered
everywhere.
97124: There'll be plenty of time for pleasure boating after you finish your
delivery.
97180: There'll be plenty of time for recreational swimming after you finish
your delivery.
97240: The shore tapers off here, making it impossible to pass without getting
into the water.
97300: As you arrive with the last of the cargo, you begin to hear a low rumble
coming from the direction of the woods. Soon you can make out the distinct
sounds of a sputtering motor and of tree branches thwacking against steel and
glass. Finally a battered pickup truck emerges from the lane and squeals to a
halt on the beach. The door opens and an old man in overalls and a straw hat
steps out.

He gives you (and your jumpsuit) the once-over, then glances back
to the truck where you nervously presume is located a large-caliber weapon of
some sort. Fortunately he decides to give you a second look and eventually
spots the SpeedEx logo on your pocket. "So, you brought my stuff, huh," he says
in a gruff yet nonchalant voice. "I trust you didn't have any problem gettin'
them over here?" Though he looks like someone who would appreciate a good yarn,
you're anxious to get home and so you simply shake your head no.

Anxious to
get going, you say, "Well, I'd better be on my way, then," and the old man tips
his hat in a gesture of thanks. He turns and begins loading the cargo into his
truck, all the while whistling a jaunty tune that sounds strangely familiar.
You're about to head back across the river when the man leans out of the truck
and yells to you:

"Say, you look like a bright person, maybe you can help me
with something. I know these four guys with a lamp who are trying to cross a
bridge..."
