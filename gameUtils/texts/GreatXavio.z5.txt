81084: for finding the correct murderer, having the goods on him, with Det.
Vukovich present to arrest him, and keep you out of trouble, plus a little
something to celebrate with.
81668: Score:
81676: Moves:
81684: Time:
81692: You can't go that way.
82024: Please give one of the answers above.
82052: [You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
82088: [Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
82128: "Oops" can only correct a single word.
82156: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
82188: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
82248: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
82292: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
82332: I didn't understand that sentence.
82392: You seem to have said too little!
82416: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
82452: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
82488: You excepted something not included anyway!
82520: You can only do that to something animate.
82552: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
82600: I didn't understand the way that finished.
82632: Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which exactly?
82784: Are you sure you want to restart?
82808: The game file has verified as intact.
82836: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupt.
82880: Attempt to begin transcript failed.
82908: Attempt to end transcript failed.
82932: You're carrying too many things already.
82964: You can't put something on top of itself.
82996: You can't put something inside itself.
83024: That would scarcely empty anything.
83080: You can only get into something free-standing.
83116: But you aren't in anything at the moment.
83148: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
83188: is now in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gives long
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
83284: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).
83368: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
83544: This dangerous act would achieve little.
83572: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
83604: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
83636: Digging would achieve nothing here.
83664: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
83692: You would achieve nothing by this.
83716: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
83744: But there's no water here to carry.
83772: Real adventurers do not use such language.
83804: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
83832: There's not enough water to swim in.
83860: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
83888: That would be less than courteous.
83912: Is that the best you can think of?
83936: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
83976: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
84008: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
84096: You're flopping around in the oversized staff uniform. The sleeves are
so long you can barely use your hands, and if it weren't for your superhuman
dexterity, you'd probably fall over on your face if you tried to take a step.
Uh, you don't have superhuman dexterity.
84284: You're dressed like you were woken up in the middle of the night. That
may be because you WERE woken up in the middle of the night. As Dr. Todd would
no doubt say, there's a logical explanation for everything.
84436: Try as you might you don't find a credit card. You ARE just an
impoverished graduate student. Maybe you don't have one.
84524: It is tempting. It'd put an end to Dr. Todd's whole silly adventure if
you just fell asleep in front of the hotel fireplace. Still it'd be bad for
your back.
84640: It's just too creepy falling asleep here with a dead body next door.
84688: Some shut-eye would be nice, but the Great Xavio might show up and turn
you into a frog if he found you sleeping on his couch.
84776: "Oh, very well," Mildred Nottinghaus says, "Your apology is accepted.
But you shouldn't go around accusing people of murder. It's not polite."
84884: "Mercouri the Magnificent is not amused. Apology not accepted."
84932: Looking at the locked staff locker reminds you that your great-uncle
Basset, now retired, is probably the most famous bank robber in Canadian
history. Well, it's a distinction of sorts. He'd probably know how to get this
lock open in a jiffy.
85104: The brainiac thought occurs to you that maybe Dr. Todd has a credit
card. You could ask him for it.
85176: What better way to look like you belong in a hotel than to ask for a
room? Now that's thinking!
85244: She's knitting a sweater standing up. That can't be comfortable. If you
brought her a chair, that'd be a nice thing. That's the nice Canadian in you.
But more importantly maybe she'd appreciate it.
85388: You think about where you can get a chair. Stealing one out of the lobby
would bring this whole adventure to a bad end.
85472: It occurs to you that if you rented a room, you could probably
discreetly move the chair out of there.
85544: That's been an awful of lot thinking going on here. Maybe you should
think somewhere else. Get a fresh perspective on things.
85632: This fog is so thick that it could hide easily hide all manner of
things. Maybe it's worth searching.
85704: You could always register at the hotel to get a room key.
85744: If you needed a light to see by, you could probably just ask the
concierge for a match.
85804: You finally realize that what Dr. Todd is asking you to do is prove that
a magician's trick was actually a trick.
85884: "Hagerston. At last! I'm glad to see that my lessons on the benefit of
the logical method have finally begun to reach you. Let us think together. I'm
sure that we'll find that thinking will be useful throughout the course of our
adventure."
86056: "Hagerston, I'm very glad to see you in a positive, affirmative mood."
86108: "I am disappointed to note that your usual cynicism and despair has
returned."
86164: "Hagerston, I prefer that we use the process of logic to achieve our
ends. Were divine intervention even possible, I would not like to rely on it."
86272: You are unable to push the cart while you are folded up inside it.
86320: "Hagerston, is it logical to attempt to swim in that bathtub? I admit
that it is rather over-sized. But I must point out that it is utterly lacking
in water. I fear that my teaching has not done you as much good as I should
have hoped."
86488: "Hagerson, is it at all logical what you are doing to my credit card?"
86540: That doesn't fit. It's a room key slot.
86572: The light on the room key slot next to the jacuzzi door blinks red for a
moment, but nothing else happens.
86648: The light above the slot flashes green, and you hear the door's lock
click.
86704: Once you've inserted the room key, you can probably push the button for
one of the executive suite floors.
86780: Once you've inserted the room key in the slot, you can probably push the
button for one of the executive suite floors.
86864: It's a champagne glass, and while you don't know much about such things,
the weight suggests that it must be leaded. Probably expensive. Quite possibly
fragile.
86986: Your violent actions break the champagne glass you are carrying.
87036: The champagne glasses are leaded crystal and look quite fragile. You
can't safely carry two of them.
87108: You'll need to open the bottle first before filling any glasses.
87156: The glass calls out for some sort of sparkling beverage. Sadly you don't
have any.
87216: The Farfalla is one of the grand old San Francisco hotels. Not the sort
of place you'd go on your own. But then you're not here because you wanted to
be. It's eight stories of still pretty much gleaming white marble, and no doubt
a room costs as much a night as your apartment does for the month.
87424: It was founded in 1898 by Luigi Fornoni and this is the second building
to bear the name. The first was destroyed in 1906 and Signor Fornoni rebuilt in
an even grander style. You'd got that far on the brass plaque when Dr. Todd
showed up. It was more than you really wanted to know.
87630: There's a thick fog out tonight.
87658: The door into the hotel is south.
87688: You can't leave now: that would be leaving the scene of the crime.
You're already in enough trouble as it is.
87768: "Hagerston, while it is true that we have proven to ourselves that this
magician has engaged in trickery, nevertheless, is it logical for us to leave
yet? I think not. We must bring home to him that what he has been performing
is, in fact, illogical!"
87944: You're still not sure why you agreed to this adventure, but if you tried
to leave now, Dr. Todd would no doubt tell you it was illogical to begin
something and not finish it.
88068: The brass plaque tells you about Signor Fornoni, the second construction
of the hotel, the San Francisco fire and earthquake. You're sure after reading
this time you'll remember. Well, pretty sure.
88212: You initial instincts were right: it really was more than you wanted to
know.
88284: "Hagerston, I hope you haven't already lost the penlight I gave you.
That would be most illogical."
88360: He hands you the penlight. "Hagerston, really, shouldn't you think to
bring the basic tools for this sort of adventure?"
88448: "Hagerston, I'm troubled. I'm sure you believe, as I do, in the
rationality of the world around us. There is no device that can convert a
single rose into a bouquet of lilies or a one dollar bill into a one thousand
dollar bill. And yet this magician, this so- called Great Xavio claims to have
a device that can do just that. I saw him this evening performing, that is
spouting his mystical mumbo-jumbo, and it's just wrong to confuse people in
that way. I believe we should undertake to prove that what I saw transpire this
evening was a fraud, and I will need your assistance to do so. I have waited
until this hour with the logical assurance that we will therefore appear less
suspicious."
88936: "Hagerston, when we first came here tonight, our purpose was to unmask
the trickeries used by this so-called Great Xavio. But now our most logical
course of action is to find the necessary evidence to unmask this killer and
with that evidence in hand," he actually points to his head at this point, but
that doesn't really surprise you, "ACCUSE him or her of this heinous crime. I
shall take it upon myself to tabulate the evidence that we find. Feel free to
ask me any time what evidence we have currently accumulated."
89304: "Hagerston, I'm troubled. I'm sure you believe, as I do, in the
rationality of the world around us. There is no device that can convert a
single rose into a bouquet of lilies or a one dollar bill into a one thousand
dollar bill. And yet this magician, this so- called Great Xavio claims to have
a device that can do just that. I saw him this evening performing, that is
spouting his mystical mumbo-jumbo, and it's just wrong to confuse people in
that way. I believe we should undertake to prove that what I saw transpire this
evening was a fraud, and I will need your assistance to do so."
89720: "My credit card, what I have done with it? This is very important, I've
now lost my credit card. We must apply the logical method to the finding of my
credit card. This is our most important goal!"
89864: He hands you his credit card. "Hagerston, I trust you will pay me back
for any charges you incur while it is in your possession?"
89956: "I'm not at all sure that the system of credit, as it is constituted in
the United States today, is at all logical. Perhaps you are right that we
should give this some thought."
90084: "Really, Hagerston, these blue books are the representation of some
student's honest efforts in the study of logic. Shouldn't you treat the with a
little more respect than to just lose them like that?"
90228: He looks at the blue book in a puzzled way for a moment before he hands
it to you. "I wondered what had happened to that."
90316: "Hagerston! Do you think it at all logical to grope around in my
pockets! Wouldn't it be more logical to ask me for the object you wish?"
90414: Dr. Rex Excalibur Todd, Professor of Computer Science, Symbolic Logic,
and Analytic Philosophy (and some other stuff you forget at the moment--it is
the middle of the night) at the University of California at Berkeley. He's tall
and thin and is currently dressed in orange corduroy pants and a houndstooth
jacket, whose pocket is bulging with junk. Should you ever actually write your
thesis, this is the guy who has to approve it. As a consequence you have an
unfortunate tendency to do what he tells you.
90776: "Well, Hagerston, I'm glad to see you're here in order to accomplish our
mission."
90840: "Hagerston, you're welcome. And I must say that I'm glad to see that
you, too, find the use of the ordinary forms of politeness to be logically
sound."
90952: "Hagerston, is that a logical question to undertake at the moment?"
91000: "Hagerston, there is no doubt that the parsing of the English language
is difficult feat, and it is probably the case that I am at fault.
Nevertheless, I would suggest that it is logical that you make yourself clearer
so that we can in fact communicate what information we might wish."
91200: "I've nothing left in my pocket."
91260: . Let me know if it can help you."
91288: . Let me know if these can help you."
91352: "Hagerston, our mission has now logically devolved to finding this
dastardly murderer and accusing him of the crime with the evidence to back up
our statements."
91464: "The gentleman you speak of, Hagerston, is directly in front of us.
Perhaps it is best if we put our questions directly to him."
91556: "Hagerston, I suspect I find him just as puzzling as you did. No doubt
he is another one of these devious and illogical magicians."
91652: "I believe he is another one of these magicians, Hagerston. Perhaps you
are better informed? No? Well, then, I assert he is a magician, and as such, is
assumed devious until proven otherwise.
91792: Have you noticed how he generally alliterates in his conversation?"
Questions, questions, questions. Which, by now, you know better than to try to
answer.
91904: "Hagerston, I believe we need to examine those three elements essential
to demonstrating the solution to a murder. Could you remind me of what they are
again?" 
You're not really sure what he's talking about, but then that's often
the case. You try a guess, "Motive, means, and opportunity?" 
"Yes, thank you
Hagerston, that's it exactly. I rely on your remarkable knowledge of the facts
and figures of this world we live in. Part of the job of being a man of action,
as you are, is to remain well-informed. I must commend you on your success in
doing so. Also we might consider what evidence we have accumulated. If you ask
me at any point, I will attempt to logically sum up the evidence as best as I
can."
92408: "Hagerston, what would you argue are the classic motivations for murder?
I should certainly include the acquisition of wealth, professional rivalry, and
irritation of long-standing. Of course, murder is never logical, so it most
difficult for me to truly entertain this question."
92604: "Well, Hagerston, I believe the means in this case is clear. It remains
sticking in the body. Perhaps further examination can tell us more about the
subject, though."
92724: "Perhaps in some ways, this is the most interesting of the three
categories, Hagerston. Who had the opportunity to come upon the late Great
Xavio? We must further investigate this crucial question."
92868: "Hagerston, I'm certain I have read in the most reliable of sources of
the general usefulness of towels."
92944: "Never fear, Hagerston, it is a simple charge that you have given me,
but I intend to fulfill it admirably. I will carry the tray."
93114: You're not sure what it is about money that makes it illogical to carry
any, but something must be, because he never does. Perhaps carrying a credit
card is what's logical. Hah! It couldn't be mere heedlessness on the part of
the august Dr. Todd. No. Certainly not.
93308: "Is it reasonable on your part, Hagerston, to continuously ask me for
money when you know that I have already given you what I have? I trust you
wouldn't suspect me of holding out on you. We are engaged in this adventure
together. That would be most illogical of me."
93500: "I have often wondered what exactly is the logical basis for the use of
money in our society. Perhaps, as you suggest, now is a good time to give some
thought to this interesting question."
93632: "Hagerston, I am disappointed. If I am a competent teacher of logic,
then you, my student, would understand the use of
93720: . But still you find it necessary to ask me about
93832: "Hagerston, perhaps with the use of this staff uniform we could pretend
to making a room service delivery to the Great Xavio. A careful analysis of the
situation suggests to me that, once we are inside his room, we will have a much
better chance of proving that he is, as I am certain he is, a fraud."
94044: "It seems rather large, doesn't it? I suggest to you that overlargeness
in uniforms is not a rational idea."
94124: "Hagerston, I will cheerfully summarize all the evidence that I think we
have collected if you periodically ask me about evidence."
94216: "Well, Hagerston, it does seem to me that we are nearing the end of our
adventure. I believe we can now find the murderer and accuse him with his
heinous crime."
94332: "I am glad to see that you value my help, Hagerston. There have been
times during your years as my student when I have thought you didn't give
proper respect to my mastery of the logical method. For now, I suggest we enter
the hotel. But I will be glad to offer my advice whenever you ask." Somehow,
you suspect he will offer his advice even unasked. But it is nice to know you
can ask if you want to.
94616: "Hagerston, as I am uncertain of your knowledge of Italian, perhaps it
is not inappropriate of me to point out that this gentleman," he gestures to
the concierge, "previously indicated that a room service delivery was being
made to the third floor? If that information was perfectly obvious to you, may
I both commend your scholarship and ask that you not be offended?"
94876: "Hagerston, have we asked the concierge about this Great Xavio yet? I
think in any case that would be a reasonable beginning."
94968: "This fog seems particularly thick to me, Hagerston. Logically, I think,
we might benefit from searching it."
95048: "Hagerston, may I suggest that if we looked like we were delivering room
service, she might be more inclined to let us in? The application of logic
indicates this is a feasible plan."
95176: "I believe I heard that large man in the lobby say on the phone that
there was a room service delivery to the third floor."
95264: "Rigorous thought, which I believe you should employ in your own behalf,
Hagerston, suggests to me that we might find a staff uniform in a staff area.
Such places are, I believe, often found in the basement of the larger hotels."
95428: "Unfortunately, at the moment Hagerston, I have nothing further to
suggest. Perhaps we should explore, gather more facts to which we may apply
ourselves? Exploring and the gathering of facts are, I think, your particular
area of expertise."
95600: "Hagerston, analysis of the problem suggests to me that searching the
bar might provide us with something lost by a guest of the hotel. As you are no
doubt aware, the drinking of alchohol can lead to sub-optimal behavior."
95756: "I believe I brought along something useful for just this situation.
Yes, I have a penlight and a blue book in my pocket. If you like, I could give
you either one."
95876: "Hagerston, if you wish to see a door open, it never hurts to try simply
knocking."
95936: "It may be that I can offer some logical suggestions as to our proper
course at different times. But for now, I have nothing to suggest. It is time
for the person of action (that's you, you know) to act!"
96084: "Prosecco is an Italian champagne. Well, that's a bit imprecise, really.
You do agree that it's always best to be precise?" You know better than to
interrupt him at such a moment. It's a question that needs no answer. "Rather
than a true champagne, it in fact is a sparking wine produced by the Charmat
method." He examines the bottle for a moment. "And this is actually a rather
good vintage. As you are no doubt aware, Hagerston, champagne is often drunk to
celebrate the successful completion of an arduous task."
96452: "You can't certainly trust me on this point, Hagerston. I have examined
the bottle closely, and I have deduced it will be a lovely beverage."
96556: Prosecco, an Italian champagne, is a lovely beverage.
96596: "You are referring to that rather enormous man behind the counter? I
believe he is an employee of the hotel. No doubt he could rent us a room, or
perform other useful functions."
96724: "Frankly, Hagerston, my rational faculties are now leading me to
consider him a suspect."
96788: "As an employee of this establishment, he must surely be dismayed by
this evening's events."
96856: It is good that we think about this logically, Hagerston. I believe we
have found the following piece
96928: "I believe we must search for evidence to prove who it was who did this
murder, Hagerston. Even the profoundest logical mind can't work without
evidence. Evidence serves as the premises from which the logical detective
makes his deductions."
97216: This is the guy who's going to approve (or not) your thesis. However
justified, an attack seems unwise.
97292: Ick. There's got to a better way to butter him up.
97332: He takes the credit card you offer him. "Well, yes, Hagerston, perhaps
it is best that I keep my credit card."
97416: "Well, Hagerston, perhaps I will take this tray, at least until we can
find a location to return it to."
97492: "Well, yes, Hagerston, perhaps I shall keep this lovely bottle of
Prosecco for now. We won't need it until a later moment of celebration, should
there be one."
97608: "Hagerston, these champagne glasses are lovely, and no doubt quite
fragile. Do you think it at all logical that I should try juggling them in this
way? Perhaps if you were to find me some sort of tray, I might be able to
properly carry several champagne glasses."
97792: Dr. Todd sips the prosecco. "Ah, Hagerston, as a logical examination of
the label had told me: it's a marvelous beverage. The uses of logic are
manifold. I must thank you." He finishes the prosecco, and then smacks his lips
in a manner that strikes you as not at all logical.
97992: Dr. Todd drinks the mimosa. "Excellent, Hagerston. As you see, even the
production of cocktails can be improved by the proper application of the
logical method."
98108: "Hagerston, thank you." Dr. Todd downs the juice in one long pull. "That
will restore the energy that all my brain work our quest has consumed."
98216: "Well, perhaps I am best-suited to carrying the champagne glass. You
after all are the man of action."
98292: "Hagerston, aren't you in fact the man of action? And aren't I the
logical apparatus? I think it's best if you keep whatever any useful objects we
accumulate."
98408: It just feels too weird ordering Dr. Todd around.
98444: "Remember, Hagerston, I am the man of logic. It is my part to perform
logical deductions and then tell you of my results. You are the man of action.
Therefore you do things. There may be moments when you wish to ask me
something, and at those times I will put my logical machine," he taps the side
of his head at this point, "to work in your behalf."
98692: "Hagerston, after having logically considered the matter, I believe you
can get along without that."
98764: "But you already have that object, Hagerston. Your request is, I'm
afraid, utterly illogical."
99044: "Hagerston, I grant that the parsing of the English language is a
difficult subject, and it may be that I am at fault, but isn't it logical that
you make yourself clearer?"
99168: "Hagerston, I believe that we should keep together. With my mastery of
the logical method, and your flair for action, we work best as a team."
99272: "Hagerston, I really don't think there's room for both of us to get
under the table cloth."
99340: "Hagerston, while I think I see where your going with this plan, I'm
afraid it won't work if I crawl inside the room service cart right in front of
this woman. Perhaps we need to push the cart away and do it somewhere else."
99500: "Well, Hagerston, I suppose this might be successfully sneaky in some
way. I trust you have a plan." Dr. Todd crawls into the lower part of the room
service cart. He's fairly invisible.
99636: "Let us examine this closely, Hagerston. Is it logical for me to wear
this uniform? As you can readily notice by a simple application of your nose,
the uniform is not clean. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it smells fairly
terrible. Now your clothes are already dirty and further are the sort of
clothes that can easily be washed, while I am wearing clothes that to be
cleaned must be taken to the dry cleaners at some expense. Therefore, I suggest
to you that if one of us is to wear the uniform, it is more logical that you
should wear it." Ick. Logic. What is about logic that it never works out in
your favor?
100068: Dr. Todd crawls out from under the room service cart. "Hagerston, I'm
sure you won't mind if I do a few of my yoga exercises now. At my age, I get
stiff more easily." Dr. Todd proceeds to cross his eyes in an attempt to look
at the tip of his nose. At least, that's what you think he's doing.
100280: "But, really, Hagerston, is what you suggest our most logical course of
action?"
100340: "Hagerston! That is not a charge you should bandy about lightly. Is it
logical to think that I should commit the murder of this magician? Well, now
that mention it, perhaps it is a thought worth considering. It's true that I
did think that he was corrupting the minds of innocents, hoodwinking them into
doubts about the merit of the logical process. That would account for my
motive. It is also true that you do not know where I was at the time of the
murder, which must have been earlier this evening. In fact, I can assure that I
do not have a, what is the proper word?" Alibi, you suggest. "Yes, that's it,
Hagerston, I do not, in fact, have an alibi. Perhaps, through the use of logic
I can yet convince you that it was not I who murdered this magician. Let us
apply ourselves." 
Augghh. You should have just kept your mouth shut.
100936: No crime has been committed that you know of.
100968: Dr. Todd crawls out from under the room service cart. "Hagerston, as
you know it's a perfectly logical action to toot one's own horn. If you do not
do it yourself, then who will? Consquently, I do say that my plan to get in
this room by the use of the room service trolley was exceptional."
101176: "Hagerston! That's the Great Xavio! While it's true I thought he was a
dangerous fraud, he isn't any longer, and we must apply the logical method to
finding his murderer. When we have found the culprit and the evidence we need,
we must ACCUSE that nefarious villain. We have no higher priority! I shall take
it upon myself to tabulate the evidence that we find. Feel free to ask me any
time what evidence we have currently accumulated."
101490: "Look, Hagerston, towels! A whole pile of them! They are an object
universally useful. I strongly suggest you take one."
101582: "This is it, this iron chest. Hagerston! We have found his so-called
Magic Multiplier. Now it is incumbent upon us to determine exactly how this
fraudulent device operated."
101710: "Hagerston! You see the pernicious effect of this magician! This young
man is now concerned with ghosts after having seen this villain's magical show.
You need not worry, young man, I am not a ghost. I am a logician."
101870: "Ah, Hagerston, a vending machine. Let us see. No. It doesn't offer
batteries. I must say, I consider that most illogical. Batteries are always a
very useful item.
101996: Fortunately, I thought ahead to put fresh batteries in the penlight
which I earlier gave you."
102064: Dr. Todd says, "I'm glad we're making progress in this way."
102112: "Hagerston," Dr. Todd asks, "Do you think this is a logical direction?"
You know better than to answer that question.
102202: "I'm glad you see the importance of exposing the mystery of the Great
Xavio," Dr. Todd says. You're not sure you do see the importance, but you're
here now.
102320: Dr. Todd is one step behind you.
102346: Dr. Todd's corduroys rustle at your side.
102380: Dr. Todd stares at you quizzically.
102408: Dr. Todd is still at your side. Annoyingly.
102442: Dr. Todd pushes his glasses up his nose.
102476: Dr. Todd looks over his glasses at you.
102506: Dr. Todd taps his right temple thoughtfully.
102542: Dr. Todd is muttering something about "
102576: Nobody thinks that orange corduroys go with a houndstooth jacket. You
close your eyes rather than look at the combination.
102788: "Hagerston! I would appreciate it if you would keep your hands out of
my pockets! Please ask me for anything you wish that you think I might have.
That, I would suggest, is the most logical course of action."
102936: You always knew Dr. Todd had a penchant for overwrought clothing, but
this houndstooth jacket is really too much. The lapels suggest it was made in
about 1975, and no, he didn't buy it in a thrift shop. No doubt, he's owned it
since then. His jacket pocket seems to be bulging with junk. Probably blue
books from three years ago.
103172: "Hagerston! May I suggest that politeness is actually logical? If you
are interested in what possessions I have, shouldn't you simply ask about
them?"
103280: "Hagerston! I would much prefer that you ask me about my possessions
rather than groping about in my pockets."
103360: The pocket of Dr. Todd's houndstooth jacket is bulging with junk.
103408: The jacket pocket is stretched slack from years of carrying more things
than any human being needed.
103476: Dr. Todd's glasses seem surprisingly hip. The sort of thing Mastroianni
would have worn in the fifties.
103552: "Hagerston, it seems unlikely that my prescription would in any way
benefit you; at the same time, it definitely eases my ability to get around if
I'm wearing my glasses."
103676: There's a small green metallic penlight here, glowing serviceably.
103724: There's a small blue metallic penlight here.
103756: There's a small green metallic penlight here.
103788: There's a small green metallic penlight here, glowing serviceably.
103836: You could examine it more closely if you were to ask Dr. Todd to give
it to you.
103896: It's a small green metallic penlight.
103924: Some poor student's blue book. It's already been filled in and it's
just waiting for Todd to grade it. You note the course number. Dr. Todd hasn't
taught that course in two years.
104054: It really is one of the grand hotels. The floor is colored marble,
there are fluted columns supporting the ceiling, the ceiling is high and
painted a deep blue.  There are two awfully comfortable-looking wing chairs and
a side table grouped around an unlit fireplace. 

There's a darkened bar to the
east. The elevator lobby is further to the south.
104300: The fluted columns are a white marble and feel cool to the touch.
They're topped with a square capstone.
104376: You try it again. They really are cool to the touch.
104416: This wing chair is at the left of the fireplace. It's large and
comfortably padded. It would probably be very easy to fall asleep in.
104510: Dr. Todd says, "Hagerston, Is it reasonable we should sit around in
this way? If we're going to prove this magician a fraud, I think it's best we
do it before morning."
104640: This wing chair is at the right of the fireplace. After some
consideration you decide it looks just a little less comfortable than the one
on the left.
104744: Dr. Todd says, "Hagerston, Is it reasonable we should sit around in
this way? If we're going to prove this magician a fraud, I think it's best we
do it before morning."
104868: The marble top of this small side table features the logo of the hotel:
either a butterfly or a Rorschach blot, you're not really sure which.
104968: And that's the same as was on the knife in the body! Of course! It was
the hotel logo on that knife.
105040: The famed pink pages. The San Francisco Chronicle's arts and
entertainment section, printed on pink newsprint. You notice that the cover
features The Great Xavio.
105160: The article on the Great Xavio ends enthusiastically. 'Don't miss this
show!' it says, 'The Great Xavio is in town for two nights performing all his
and your favorite magic tricks, including his signature show-stopper, the Magic
Multiplier. This is the trick which turns a flower into a bouquet for the
prettiest girl in the audience, then turns a single cookie into a giant cookie
to the delight of all the children, and finally turns a simple one dollar bill
into a genuine one thousand dollar bill for some lucky member of the audience.
You'll be amused, amazed, and you just might make a profit. What could be
better? As of this writing, there are still a few tickets available. $$$.' At
the end of the review, you see an image of a little man jumping out of his seat
with excitement.
105720: The fireplace isn't currently lit, which is a pity. You could imagine
pleasantly toasting your toes if you were sitting in the chair in front of the
lit fireplace.
105836: "Well that's an easy request." Max hands you a paperclip. "Let me know
if there's something else I can do for you."
105924: He searches in his desk for a minute. "Oh, dear. That's quite
surprising. I'm really all out of paperclips."
106148: vero? Subito, signore." He turns his attention back to you, "I'm sorry.
I hadn't meant to speak Italian to you."
106236: He hands you a book of matches. "I hope you're not planning on smoking
in the lobby."
106300: "We seem to be in short supply tonight. I'm sorry."
106340: "I'm sorry, I'm now out of those."
106368: "Are you staying at our hotel? No? We do give out complimentary
toiletries, but only to guests. I'm sure you understand."
106460: "Always like our guests to have clean teeth!"
106496: "I'm sorry. One per customer per day. Brushing your teeth too often is,
you know, unhealthy. You can brush away the enamel." He gives you a broad
smile. His teeth are perfect.
106624: "Are you staying at our hotel? No? We do give out complimentary
toiletries, but only to guests. I'm sure you understand."
106864: vero? Subito, signore." He turns his attention back to you, "I'm sorry.
I hadn't meant to speak Italian to you.
106950: Yes, he's here. He's in 801. But I'm afraid I can't connect you to him
any more this evening. He asked not to be disturbed."
107048: You tell Max that you found the Great Xavio dead in his suite's
bathroom. "You found him!
107116: You were in room 607, weren't you?
107144: What were you doing in Xavio's room? I'm going to have to keep you
here. I'm calling the cops right away. This doesn't look very good for you." He
says it almost gleefully.
107272: "Yes, it's a great tragedy. He was a regular customer of this hotel and
normally quite a sound sleeper. What may I ask is your connection to him?"
107380: His tag says Max Zlotzky, Concierge. His suit is stylish and fits him
well. His blonde hair is neat and trim. He's smiling at you. Despite all that,
he looks more like heavyweight champion of the world than he does a concierge.
107544: "Glad to help. I'm just doing my job."
107576: "I'm going to have to get back to you on that. I'm afraid I don't have
it here."
107636: "I'm glad to do whatever I can for you."
107668: "I'm here to help, though I'm afraid I can't do much with that
request."
107724: "Now that's a puzzler. Never had a request like that before."
107772: "You sure know how to keep a good concierge running."
107812: "Could you check back with me in the morning on that? There's just
nothing I can do at this hour."
107884: "I must apologize in advance. The regular concierge will be back in the
morning. I'm just a substitute."
107960: "That's George Mercouri. I believe he styles himself Mercouri the
Magnificent. He's a rival to the Great Xavio. He's been rather difficult this
evening, but fortunately that's mostly a problem for Xavio's bodyguard."
108120: "I believe there may be some candles in the bar. I don't have any here.
But if you really need one, just go ahead and take one."
108212: "Some requests I can only fill if you've rented a room with us. I'm
sure you understand."
108280: "Yes, I believe there was a young boy named Mikey who wanted to see
Xavio earlier this evening."
108352: "Well, yes, what do you need? I have nail files, toothpaste, let's see,
soap and hair products are, of course, already in your room. Unfortunately I'm
out of toothbrushes."
108480: "Oh, oh. I just don't know what will be done about refunds for the
Great Xavio's coming show. I will be sure to look into that for you."
108580: "I'm sure you understand that I can't do much to get you tickets to
anything at this hour. I'll be glad to assist in the morning. In particular,
may I recommend that you try to see the Great Xavio's act? A fine performer and
he's currently staying at our hotel."
108768: "Oh, I'm afraid I don't do the hiring here. If you were to come back
during the day, you could find out for sure, but I don't believe they're
looking for anyone at the moment."
108896: "This lobby was really in the grand old style, I think."
108940: "I'm afraid our jacuzzi isn't in working order at the moment. It's not
currently open. Of course, it wouldn't be open at this hour anyway. The gym is
open, however."
109064: "We pride ourseles on keeping the gym open at all hours. You can never
be too fit. I like to go down and lift weights on my break myself."
109164: "Who are you to appoint yourself the police of everything. I don't have
to account for myself to you! In any case, that woman was guarding the Great
Xavio's suite all night. I think you should be asking her such questions."
109324: "Yes. They're all over the building now."
109356: "They are on their way now, I believe."
109388: "Is there a police matter that you know of?"
109420: "We pride ourselves on our reuben sandwich, you know. I'm quite fond of
it myself."
109484: "I believe you will find that already in your room. It's normally at
the side of the bathroom sink."
109556: "Normally, I'd be able to help, but I'm afraid we're all out. Be sure
to ask me again in the morning and I'll rustle something up."
109656: "I'm sorry, I'm afraid the bar is closed at this hour."
109700: "What's your point? Are you about to accuse me of murder?"
109744: "May I ask what you were doing poking around in my staff locker? That's
reprehensible. Xavio had asked me to watch over that bundle of bills for him. I
thought it would be safe there. I see I was wrong." He strikes you as somehow
nervous, however.
109924: "Isn't he the gentleman who's with you? I believe he's standing there
right next to you."
109992: "I'm sorry. I'm afraid you have the wrong sort of hotel, and I'm the
wrong sort of concierge."
110206: vero? Subito, signore." He turns his attention back to you, "I'm sorry
I hadn't meant to speak Italian to you.
110292: It's a great hotel. It's over a hundred years old!"
110332: Farfalla is Italian for butterfly, you know." He points to a design in
the floor. "That's our logo. Many people think it's a bow tie, but it's not."
110444: He looks at you nervously. "I'm sorry, our letter opener disappeared
earlier this evening. I don't know where it is."
110532: You show the staff uniform to Max. He looks at you suspiciously.
"Excuse me, where did you find that? That shouldn't have been left lying
around."
110640: "Well, yes, actually, the entrance to our restaurant is outside and to
the left. But I'm afraid it's closed now."
110724: "George Mercouri. Yes, he's been sneaking around the hotel all evening.
He's some sort of rival to the Great Xavio. I don't know. But his behavior has
been very suspicious. I heard a report of him in the basement."
110884: "Yes, we stock a very nice prosecco in our bar. Unfortunately it's
closed for the evening."
110952: "Yes, she's the Great Xavio's bodyguard. An odd choice, I think. But
maybe the fact that he picked her is just a sign of his, I shouldn't say it,
but it's well-known, his parsimoniousness. I hope she's good at what she does,
because there have been several attempts this evening to sneak into his room,
with that rival magician, George Mercouri, being the most persistent."
111224: "I'm glad to do whatever I can for you."
111256: "I'm here to help, though I'm afraid I can't do much with that
request."
111312: "Now that's a puzzler. Never had a request like that before."
111360: "You sure know how to keep a good concierge running."
111400: "Could you check back with me in the morning on that? There's just
nothing I can do at this hour."
111472: "I must apologize in advance. The regular concierge will be back in the
morning. I'm just a substitute."
111548: He's big. So far he doesn't seem mean, but you'd hate to provoke him.
111600: He runs Dr. Todd's credit card through the machine. "If you'll just
sign here..." Todd scrawls the three initials of his three names each followed
by an illegible flat line. "Thank you. Here's your roomkey. Your room is 607,
on the sixth floor."
111784: Max Zlotzky looks at you at little strangely, but then says in his most
professional voice, "I believe we have already successfully completed the
transaction."
111896: "Well, why, thanks." Max looks at you a little suspiciously, but
accepts the staff uniform. "I don't know why that was left lying around."
112000: He looks at you a little strangely, but then in his best professional
voice says, "I'm afraid that won't be enough to rent a room here. In any case
we prefer to have a credit card for this transaction."
112144: "Oh, I'm sorry. We're not actually allowed to take tips. Please don't
be offended. It's corporate policy."
112228: "I'm sorry, but the hotel staff is not allowed to accept gifts. But I
appreciate the offer."
112296: "Glad to help. I'm just doing my job."
112328: "That's an utterly ridiculous charge. You have no evidence to back up
that unsubstantiated charge.
112400: If you weren't a guest of the hotel, I'd have you thrown out on the
spot. As it is I'm going to call up my manager." He steps into a back office.
112508: Who are you anyway? You're just snoops. I'm going to phone the police
at once." He steps into a back office.
112588: And is never heard from again. It seems he WAS the murderer, and your
ill-timed accusation made him nervous enough to flee. Successfully. You're
stuck trying to explain to the San Francisco police officers why you broke into
the hotel and tipped off a murderer.
112844: . He screams, "You!" but doesn't say anything else, leaps over the
counter and hurls himself at you.
112920: Two of the San Francisco cops appear suddenly and stop him before he
can do any damage to you, wrestling him down, finally slapping the cuffs on
him. Dr. Todd says, "Well, our outing this evening provided a very satisfactory
demonstration of the uses of the logical method, don't you agree, Hagerston?"
One of the San Francisco cops tries to drag you off to the police station, but
Det. Vukovich waves him off, "It's alright. I know these two. They're nuts, but
they're alright. They'll be there for the trial if you need them."
113300: Dr. Todd's pops open the bottle of prosecco, and pours it into the
three fancy champagne glasses, which he is still carrying on the silver tray.
George Mercouri appears out of a dark corner, holding his own champagne glass,
which Dr. Todd also fills. Dr. Todd proposes a toast: "To another fine
accomplishment of the logical method." Clink, clink. "We have achieved the
capture of this murderer through the most splendid and fastidious application
of the logical method. In particular, Hagerston, allow me to commend your
excellent performance."
113688: You thank Det. Vukovich gratefully, and go home to get the little bit
of sleep you can. 
Dr. Todd says to you as you're walking out the door, "That
was an estimable display on our part of the proper use of the logical method,
wouldn't you agree, Hagerston? If only we had accoutrements suitable for a
celebration, I should call it a perfect evening."
113940: Two of the San Francisco cops appear suddenly and stop him before he
can do any damage to you, wrestling him down, finally slapping the cuffs on
him. Dr. Todd says, "Well, our outing this evening provided a very satisfactory
demonstration of the uses of the logical method, don't you agree, Hagerston?"
But the San Francisco cops insist on dragging you down to the station as well
where you try to explain why you had broken into the Great Xavio's hotel room;
it's late morning by the time you convince them of your harmlessness, though
not your innocence. No sleep for you, but at least the murderer didn't escape.
Not as satisfactory as you might like, but if Todd's happy, you're happy.
114428: He bowls you over, but then decides against acting on his desire for
revenge just then. Fortunately, because he'd managed to knock you over
completely and you crack your head against the marble floor of the lobby. You
were out cold. You wake up in a hospital, where they keep you for three days
'for observation' before they decide you aren't any less sane than you were
before. You agree, you think. The good news is that by the sheer dead weight of
your body falling on him, you apparently managed to break his leg. Dr. Todd
comes to your hospital bed late the next day, "Hagerston, I am glad to report
that through our effort, yours physical and mine mental, we were able to ensure
that this vile killer was caught and he will be punished for his crimes."
115024: . Immediately a couple of cops show up in the lobby, and look
suspiciously at Max Zlotzky. He snarls back, "But that doesn't prove a thing.
If that's all you've got, I'll walk." But he looks worried. 
"Hagerston, he's
right. We need to find more evidence. I can see that these fine officers will
ensure he does not leave the premises now."
115272: "Mmm? I'm sorry. I don't understand your request." But you think he
looks at you little strangely. Of course, you were acting a little strange.
115380: It's an ordinary book of twenty matches. It features the Hotel Farfalla
logo--which is the same as was on the murder weapon!
115472: A plain, blue book of matches featuring the Hotel Farfalla logo.
115518: By its light, you spot a candle on a nearby table.
115560: You put it out before it burns your finger.
115644: This small nail file is actually made out of metal; it's not just one
of those cheap cardboard types. Another mark of a classy hotel.
115740: It's a small tube of toothpaste. Now if you could only get home and
brush your teeth.
115800: "Hagerston, while I am certain that good dental hygiene is a logical
activity, we have a mission! Brush your teeth later." Moreover, you don't
actually have a toothbrush.
116032: You don't have the room key for any of the rooms on this wing, and you
don't want to wake anyone up.
116102: The basement elevator lobby is quiet at this hour. There's a vending
machine marked out of order. 

A swinging door to the west is marked 'Staff
Only.' There's a hallway that leads north. A glass door to the east leads to a
small workout room. The door to the one working elevator is to the south.
Beside it are the buttons that make it go.
116348: "Hagerston, I think it's important we keep our wits about us and not
walk into walls."
116412: The slot at the side of the gym door is precisely sized to receive a
room key.
116468: The opening at the bottom of the vending machine is the place where
your purchases drop.
116532: In it, you see the following items:
116558: This vending machine seems rather poorly stocked. Presumably they'll
fill it up again in the morning. At the bottom is the opening from which you
take your purchases. Currently the vending machine has in it the following
objects for sale (the button to get the object in question is listed before and
the price after the object):
116820: "Fix your bicycle now!" the label proclaims. "This kit includes: one
inner tube, an extra valve cap, a tire lever, and a spare spoke."
116920: It's a small rectangular patch for an inner tube. Black. It's not, in
fact, very interesting.
116992: It really is a tire valve cap. Now if only you had the bicycle.
117040: "Hagerston, do you mind if I take that? I lost mine a few weeks ago,
and I've been worried that I might get a flat." Whether you minded or not, he
just did so.
117156: This is what Great Uncle Basset said you needed. Probably the rest of
the bicycle repair kit is junk for now.
117236: A bicycle spoke is reputed to be a long metal rod, and that's what this
looks like.
117296: The mimosa is a mixture of a sparkling wine and orange juice and offers
as a pleasant, if somewhat deleterious, beverage for breakfasts.
117392: An omelette aux fines herbes and a slice of ripe canteloupe would have
gone just perfectly with that mimosa.
117468: There's nothing in your glass. Dreaming of mimosas are we?
117512: But you're glass doesn't contain a mimosa.
117548: "Genuine 100% Orange Juice," the label reads.
117588: "Hagerston, do you find that the ordinary vending machine orange juice
is improved by consuming it from an expensive champagne glass? Logic suggests
to me that it might, but I have not yet reasoned out all the possibilities.
Perhaps your empirical experience can confirm my hypothesis?" You ignore him
and drink the orange juice. But now that he's mentioned it you wonder. The
orange juice does seem to taste better.
117880: "Hagerston, I'm glad to see that you're consuming nutritious beverages,
and not soda all the time. That is good, logical behavior."
118008: "Hagerston, are you certain that the proper way to make a mimosa is to
put the sparkling wine in the glass first? I think this is a question that may
require logical investigation." You are quite sure that you don't have a clue
whether the orange juice or the champagne should go first when making a mimosa.
118220: You pour the orange juice into the champagne glass.
118256: The label blares, "CHOCOLATE" and not much else. But, of course, what
more do you need to know?
118516: The jacuzzi door is frosted; outside you can see the elevator lobby,
sort of.
118572: The door to the jacuzzi opens. "Advance, agents of adventure! Mercouri
the Magnificent murmurs welcome."
118648: You insert your room key in the slot, but the indicator light flashes
red briefly, and nothing else happens.
118724: The jacuzzi door is locked. However, next to it there is a slot for
your room key that might do something.
118800: You insert your key in the slot next to the jacuzzi door. The indicator
light flashes red briefly and nothing else happens.
118888: "Hagerston! That's exactly the pragmatic spirit I expect of you. A good
effort. But maybe our best course of action is to acquire a room key of some
sort."
119000: The gym door is glass; through it, you can see the a couple of exercise
machines. There's a slot at the side of the door to insert your room key.
119104: The gym door is glass; outside you can see the elevator lobby for the
floor.
119160: The door to the gymnasium swings shut again.
119192: You insert your key in the slot next to the gym door. The door swings
open.
119248: The gym door is locked. However, next to it there is a slot for your
room key that might do something.
119320: You insert your key in the slot next to the gym door. The door swings
open.
119376: "Hagerston! That's exactly the pragmatic spirit I expect of you. A good
effort. But maybe our best course of action is to acquire a room key of some
sort."
119488: The staff room is surprisingly dingy for such a grand hotel. The cover
over the fluorescent light fixture is cracked. Two benches are bolted into the
floor. There's a locker on the west wall. 

A swinging door to the east leads
back to the basement lobby. A door to the south leads outside to the loading
dock.
119708: Two benches are bolted to the middle of the concrete floor in here.
They're made of some sort of tough and inexpensive wood. You were never very
good in shop class.
119824: That's not something you can sit down on. Really. They're that
uncomfortable.
119884: The fluorescent light fixture is cracked and there's no bulb in it;
consequently the only light in the room comes from under the swinging door to
the east. It is, however, enough light to see by.
120024: The padlock to Max's staff locker looks pretty secure to you. It
requires a key of some sort, which you don't have.
120108: You attempt to pick the padlock, but really, you don't have first clue
how to go about it. Now if you knew an expert lockpicker, maybe you could get
somewhere. Well, in fact you do. Your great-uncle Basset was the top safeman in
all of Canada's bank-robbing history. It's not every family that's got talent
like that.
120336: Stuck on the front of the locker is a "Hello, My Name Is..." badge,
with the name of Max Zlotzky the concierge written on it. It's secured by a
huge padlock.
120456: You haven't got a key for the huge padlock at its front.
120496: You attempt to pick the padlock, but really, you don't have first clue
how to go about it. Now if you knew an expert lockpicker, maybe you could get
somewhere.
120608: You attempt to pick the padlock, but really, you don't have first clue
how to go about it. Now if you knew an expert lockpicker, maybe you could get
somewhere. Well, in fact you do. Your great-uncle Basset was the top safeman in
all of Canada's bank-robbing history. It's not every family that's got talent
like that.
120836: In searching the locker, you find a wad of thousand dollar bills. A
shiver of shock or greed or something runs down your back.
121080: Now we must confront this perfidious Xavio with his patent flummery!
121128: Well, you think to yourself, this ought to satisfy Dr. Todd.
121174: "Mercouri the Magnficent," says Mercouri the Magnificent, "Also agrees
with this astute assessment."
121252: You feel a momentary urge to snatch the money and run and look no
further. But when you do look, your initial impulse is only strengthened. It's
a wad, maybe a hundred of them, of one thousand dollar bills, held together by
a rubber band. You've never had so much money in your life. You're not even
sure that you really believed so much money existed.
121500: You fondle the wad of one thousand dollar bills rather lovingly.
121548: Finally Dr. Todd says, "Hagerston, I believe you should return those to
their current location. Until we understand their exact history, and who has
rightful possession of them, I believe it's best that they remain there."
121708: But whose are they? If you were only sure they were really ill-gotten
gains. While a jail cell might give you the peace and quiet to get your thesis
done, they probably wouldn't have an outlet for your laptop.
121856: "Hagerston, I ask you: is it at all reasonable to assume that vending
machine will take one thousand dollar bills?"
121940: The staff uniform reads 'Hotel Farfalla' on a patch over the pocket.
It's an off-white, about eight sizes too large, and smells terrible.
122040: You see a pile of dirty clothes here.
122068: The uniform is off-white. A small patch reads 'Hotel Farfalla.'
122116: You see a pile of dirty clothes here.
122144: As you look at the pile of clothes, you realize it's a staff uniform. A
small patch reads 'Hotel Farfalla.'
122224: It's pretty vile, really. It really ought to go straight to the
laundry.
122276: Somebody scrubbed a bit at the cuff of the left sleeve, but you notice
that there's still a bit of blood on it.
122356: Once you get the uniform on, you realize it's enormous. Andre the Giant
might feel comfortable in it, but you don't.
122440: It's clear that when they first built this hotel, they didn't plan a
real gym. This one is squeezed in. There's an exercise bike, a rowing machine,
and a stairmaster. There's a small table near the door.
122588: "Hagerston, hurling yourself against the walls does not strike me as a
logical course of action."
122656: The exercise equipment is relatively modern, and no doubt you should
get more exercise.
122716: Exercise at this hour is utterly unappealing.
122748: "Hagerston, while I think the idea of exercise is logical, at the
moment we have a mission!"
122816: The table has elegant metal legs and a marble top. It's round. So when
you stagger off the stairmaster, sweating, you damage neither yourself nor the
table.
122928: The table is too small to support the weight of a person.
122972: A plain white towel, approximately four foot by two foot.
123012: A short dimly lit hallway with patterned carpet.

Back to the south is
the basement's elevator lobby. To the north is the glass door to the jacuzzi.
123120: The carpet's thickness makes this hallway very quiet. The pattern in
the carpet looks like repeated moths, something you don't particularly want in
your carpet. No, they must be butterflies. Of course, that seems to be the logo
of the hotel.
123292: The same as was on the letter opener thrust in the Great Xavio's body!
Of course! It was the hotel logo on the letter opener.
123384: The slot at the side of the jacuzzi door is precisely sized to receive
a room key.
123440: The jacuzzi itself takes up most of the room. There's a dial timer on
the wall to start the bubbles, except there's no water in the jacuzzi.

You can
go south back to the short hallway.
123572: The timer goes from zero to fifteen minutes.
123604: You turn the jacuzzi dial to ten minutes. "Hagerston, perhaps you
wished to conduct an experiment with the jacuzzi by turning the dial to on. But
as logic would no doubt have told you before you undertook this useless
experiment, with no water in the jacuzzi, nothing was going to happen." He's
right this time: nothing did happen.
123836: You turn the jacuzzi dial to ten minutes. "Hagerston, perhaps you
wished to conduct an experiment with the jacuzzi by turning the dial to on. But
as logic would no doubt have told you before you undertook this useless
experiment, with no water in the jacuzzi, nothing was going to happen." He's
right this time: nothing did happen.
124068: The loading dock faces on a dimly lit alley. A particulary thick fog
has settled in, making the whole alley seem unreal.
124152: It's tempting to sneak off into the fog. But you're in big trouble
already and leaving the scene of the crime would probably end you up in jail
for life...
124264: "Hagerston, doesn't it seem more logical to pursue our goals here
inside the hotel, where we know, at least recently, the Great Xavio was
staying?"
124372: It's a particularly thick fog this morning, which could hide all manner
of sins, but unfortunately not Dr. Todd. It won't burn off now until ten this
morning. An hour at which you plan to be soundly asleep.
124520: The fog is cold and thick. Waving your arms around in it in an attempt
to search it feels foolish until you accidentally grab somebody in a long blue
cape and a rakish Three Musketeers hat. "Hold thy hands off me. I am Mercouri
the Magnificent!"
124696: The loading dock is raised from the alley at a height to make it easy
for a truck to off-load its deliveries. Thick bunches of fog prevent you from
seeing much into the distance.
124818: floor of the hotel. It looks pretty much the same as all the other
non-executive suite floors. No doubt up there, where the executives stay,
there'd be something to see.

There's the door to the one working elevator to
the south and some buttons to make it go.
125004: The room service trolley is a large metal cart on wheels. It is draped
by a white linen cloth. There's really a considerable amount of room underneath
it.
125112: You've peeked out from underneath the table cloth to look around the
room.
125164: And, of course, you're hiding underneath the white linen tablecloth.
125244: You're worried that it might look suspicious if you were to push the
room service cart into the main lobby.
125320: It rolls quite smoothly across the floor. You could no doubt push it in
any direction you chose.
125388: You can think of no possible plan that you're willing to undertake
where you're squeezed in with Dr. Todd underneath the room service cart. Ewww.
125492: . Also you can sense the glare of Dr. Todd's houndstooth jacket from
under the cart.
125556: You can sense the glare of Dr. Todd's houndstooth jacket from under the
cart.
125612: You can't search the trolley very effectively from inside it.
125656: Flexing your superhuman muscles, you prepare to lift the room service
cart. "Hagerston," Dr. Todd says, "Given that this object has wheels, would you
not agree the more rational course of action is to push the object, rather than
attempt to lift it?"
125836: You squeeze yourself into the lower part of the cart. You can see the
outside world by peeking from under the white table cloth that covers the cart.
Probably nobody can see you.
125960: You push the room service cart ahead of you.
125992: The table cloth is white linen, spotlessly clean and beautifully
ironed.
126044: Todd did have his silly notion of sneaking in to the Great Xavio's room
by means of this cart. He is the genius and you're just the flunky. While it
still doesn't seem like a great idea, you leave the tablecloth in place.
126200: "Hagerston! I've got an idea! If you were to find a hotel uniform and I
were to crawl underneath the cart, we could get into the Great Xavio's room by
pretending to be room service! Isn't that a logical approach to our problem?"
Like expecting somebody to order room service at three in the morning is
logical. Hmmph. At any rate you leave the tablecloth.
126452: The label says prosecco. You stare, mesmerized, as the lovely, tingly
bubbles escape.
126516: The bottle looks like a champagne bottle. The cork looks like a
champagne cork. But the label says prosecco, denominazione di origine
controllata, and some other things in Italian. It's hard to see through the
thick glass of the bottle, but you think you see bubbles.
126776: "Hagerston, we have not yet accomplished our mission this evening. Is
not a celebration premature at this point? If you were to open that bottle,
would that not be what is commonly referred to as counting one's flightless
birds before they have emerged from their protective enclosures?"
126976: There's just no way you can put the cork back into the bottle.
127020: Holy hand grenades, Batman! Those tasty bubbles almost by themselves
makes this whole noxious adventure worth it.
127100: "Hagerston, if you will drink the prosecco contrary to my logical
advice, may I at least suggest you POUR it in to a glass?"
127192: You feel rather gauche drinking from the bottle so you only have a
taste. But it's better champagne than any you've ever had on a grad student
budget.
127296: You'd have to open the bottle to drink the champagne.
127336: The bottle of prosecco isn't open.
127364: The champagne glass is already filled. If you were to pour any more in,
you'd be wasting the prosecco.
127436: "Hagerston, are you certain that the proper way to make a mimosa is to
put the orange juice in the glass first? I think this is a question that may
require logical investigation." You are quite sure that you don't have a clue
whether the orange juice or the champagne should go first when making a mimosa.
127648: Sadly you're out of the prosecco, so you can't make mimosas any longer
this morning.
127708: The champagne glass is already filled. If you were to pour any more in,
you'd be wasting the prosecco.
127780: You fill the champage glass with the prosecco. The bubbles effervesce
in a way that's just too inviting.
127856: "Hagerston! Was it logical to drink that entire bottle of champagne
yourself? Won't that impair your abilities as a man of action?" You dont' feel
impaired. In fact, you actually feel wonderful. But even in your wonderful
state, you do have doubts about how long it will last.
128084: . You decide to save it until you get a proper champagne glass.
128128: floor of the hotel. It looks pretty much the same as all the other
non-executive suite floors. No doubt up there, where the executives stay,
there'd be something to see.

There's the door to the one working elevator to
the south and some buttons to make it go. To the north is a small maintenance
closet.
128342: This tiny maintenance closet is mostly full of uninteresting junk and
clutter. It's very crowded.

A rapid exit to the south is recommended.
128444: A metal file of about seven inches long.
128472: An old-fashioned wooden push broom. Still a very useful device, though
not one you're very likely to use.
128548: "Hagerston! You'd look ridiculous pushing that broom around. Is it at
all logical to look ridiculous in such a way?" You have to admit you agree.
128652: The executive floors certainly are pretty fancy. The elegant gold
plaque next to the elevator door indicates that this is the
128738: floor in three different numbering systems and braille. Spiffy. And the
buttons to control the elevator have a certain sparkle they didn't have on
other floors.

The door into the elevator is south.
128880: Well, the executive floors are pretty fancy. The elegant gold plaque
next to the elevator door indicates that this is the
128964: floor in three different numbering systems and braille. Spiffy. And the
buttons to control the elevator have a certain sparkle they didn't have on
other floors.

The elevator door is to the south.
129104: The room you rented is to the east.
129132: The door is real wood, not plywood. On the wall at its side is a slot
for your room key.
129196: The door is real wood, not plywood. They just don't make things like
that like they used to.
129264: You insert your key in the appropriate slot. The light flashes green,
and you hear the door's lock click.
129340: The door is locked. However, next to it there is a slot for your room
key that might do something.
129412: You insert your key in the appropriate slot. The light flashes green,
and you hear the door's lock click.
129488: The light flashes red for a second and nothing happens.
129528: "Hagerston! That's exactly the pragmatic spirit I expect of you. A good
effort. But maybe our best course of action is to acquire a room key of some
sort."
129640: The slot at the side of the 607 door is precisely sized to receive a
room key.
129696: Well, the executive floors are pretty fancy. The elegant gold plaque
next to the elevator door indicates that this is the
129780: floor in three different numbering systems and braille. Spiffy. And the
buttons to control the elevator have a certain sparkle they didn't have on
other floors.

The elevator door is to the south. The door to 801 is to the
east.
129944: "Did the great man order room service again? He had a reuben sandwhch
at one o'clock in the morning. If I eat something just before I go to bed, it
goes straight to my hips. No wonder he's looking a little pudgy. And here I
thought he was planning to sleep!" You smile and try to look like you're an old
hand at room service deliveries.
130184: "Hey, wait a minute, who are you?" She gestures to Dr. Todd. "You can't
go in there." Since Dr. Todd seems to insist on going in with you, Mildred
Nottinghaus blocks the door to the both of you. You whisper to her that you'll
go away, try to ditch him, and then come back.
130388: Mildred Nottinghaus says, "I'm afraid I can't let you in there. He's
signed all the autographs he's going to sign this evening."
130484: It's an unexciting hotel hall carpet. It's gray. Fortunately it has
been vacuumed recently.
130552: "What? Has the great man ordered room service again this evening? No
wonder he's looking a little pudgy. Well, you just go on and push the cart on
through east."
130668: "You aren't getting in to see him tonight. There's been autograph
hounds and his rival Mercouri hanging about all night, and he needs some rest
before his show tomorrow. He may not pay me enough, but this is what he pays me
to do."
130832: "I'm sorry, he won't be signing any more autographs this evening. He's
gone to sleep and he particularly asked that I not let anyone in. May I suggest
you buy tickets for tomorrow night's show? People have been trying to get in
all night. I hope you're the last. I'm getting a little sleepy myself."
131048: You tell Mildred Nottinghaus that you've just found the body of the
Great Xavio murdered. "Dead! Murdered! I've been here all night. This can't
have happened. It just can't. George Mercouri's been hanging around the hotel
this evening. He's been trying to steal Xavio's best tricks for his own show.
It must be him. Or some autograph hound. But if what you say is true I'd better
call the cops."
131340: "He was a great man. If he just wasn't so cheap. It's his cheapness
that's got him into this mess."
131416: "He ordered room service earlier, around midnight, I think it was. I
can't be sure, but it might have been that nice young man at the front desk who
brought it up. The one with the funny name."
131556: Mildred Nottinghaus is slumped against the wall, whether from
exhaustion, despair, or worry, you're not sure.
131636: Standing outside the door of the Great Xavio's penthouse suite is a
woman of about sixty-five. She's gray-haired, but looks fit. She's wearing
jeans and an embroidered sweatshirt. There's a canvas bag on the floor next to
her, and from it a blue strand of yarn leads to her knitting needles. She
appears to be knitting a child's sweater. Uncomfortable thing to do standing
up, you'd think.
131912: Mildred Nottinghaus is sleeping peacefully on the chair you were so
kind to bring her. The sweater she was knitting has fallen to the floor.
132012: Her knitting needle has almost fallen out of her hand.
132060: i've got nothing to say to you. You think I'm a murderer."
132104: Mildred weeps quietly and ignores you.
132132: Mildred looks at you with mild puzzlement, then returns to her
knitting.
132184: "Well, of course I don't have an alibi. Ridiculous. I could have popped
in there at any time. I don't think you're a very nice young man."
132288: "Yes, that Mercouri certainly had a motive. That's all I've got to say
on that."
132352: "Well, I suppose I'll have to arrange refunds for tomorrow night's
show. If I get my hands on that Mercouri, I'll strangle him myself."
132456: "Actually, now that I think about it, tomorrow's show is sold out."
132508: "There are no tickets remaining for tomorrow night's show."
132552: You tell Mildred that you found a small boy in Xavio's suite. "What!
I've been watching for that Mercouri villain all night and a child sneaks in?
I'm going to have to fire myself."
132684: Mildred Nottinghaus rubs a tear from her eye. "He could be cheap, but I
liked the guy. And these cops are so brutal with all their questions. I hope
they find whoever did it. And by whoever, I mean George Mercouri"
132840: "It's a sweater for my grandniece Mary. She's my sister Emily's
youngest daughter's child. It's a little tough to knit standing up, but it's
got to be done by tomorrow. Little Mary turns five tomorrow. She's so cute."
Mildred Nottinghaus tells you more about Emily, Mary, and other family members
whose names you don't even try to remember. She offers to show you pictures.
You gently decline.
133128: "Well, I suppose I'll have to find a new job now. Fortunately, I've got
a few dollars socked away. Maybe I'll go live with my niece in Las Vegas."
133240: "I work as Mr. Xavio's bodyguard. It's a job. I'm good at it. I think
he should have given me a raise after I learned karate, but he can be pretty
cheap."
133356: "George Mercouri thinks he may be magnificent, but there's no way his
show will ever rival that of the Great Xavio. Try as he might to steal all the
Xavio's tricks, Xavio's got a few tricks of his own."
133504: "Xavio's death is just what Mercouri wanted all along. He said he was
just trying to master the tricks in order to perform them better. But now he
doesn't have a rival at all, does he? He doesn't have to worry about how well
he performs them at all, does he? I've been watching for him in particular all
night, and I don't see how he got in. He must have though."
133764: "There's just been all sorts of people trying to get in here tonight.
Autograph hounds, mostly. I'm just so exhausted. I wish I could sit down for a
minute. But that Mercouri is sneaky. He's the worst. I've got to be on the
watch for him constantly."
133948: "It's a job. But it is a low-paying job. I don't really want to say
anything bad about him, but, well, he's a little cheap. You should see how it
hurts him to give away that one thousand dollar bill every night. But even he
has to admit it's a good gimmick. Now if only he'd given a few more of them to
me."
134168: "Oh, Xavio always stays here when he's performing in town. It's a great
hotel, don't you think? Now all they need is a chair for the hallway."
134272: "Hmm? Oh, no thank you, dear. It would only make me sleepy."
134320: "Oh, well, it's not so much that I really want to sleep. If I just had
a chair that I could sit on for a little while, I'd be OK. I do have to stay
awake to watch out for Mercouri."
134456: "Oh, well, I could talk about my family all night long. You're a very
nice young person to listen so patiently. But I'm sure you have things to do."
134564: "I enjoy it. It keeps the hands busy when you have to stay awake. But
it is easier if you have a chair."
134640: "Mmmm, dear, I'm not really sure I understand what you're talking
about. Be so kind and explain it to me more clearly."
134728: "Have you ever heard of Mrs. Pollifax? I warn you that, like her, I
know karate."
134792: She is a grandmother, right? Attacking her seems like an easy thing to
do. You should be able to just overpower her and then waltz into the room to
find whatever it is that Todd thinks you should find. All that seemed true, so
it's a little puzzling why you're lying here on the floor with a sore Adam's
apple.
135012: This time it's her foot that moves faster than you. It connects with
your chin and you're on the floor.
135088: You're not sure what hit you, and now it doesn't matter any more, does
it?
135144: "Why that's very considerate of you. It'll allow me to rest my feet and
get my sweater done that much faster." Mildred Nottinghaus sits down in the
chair and in ten minutes is sound asleep.
135280: She takes her knitting needle back, but glares at you suspiciously.
135328: "I'm going to have to refuse that. I trust you didn't mean that by way
of a bribe."
135392: You tell Mildred Nottinghaus that you've just found the body of the
Great Xavio murdered. "Dead! Murdered! I've been here all night. This can't
have happened. It just can't. George Mercouri's been hanging around the hotel
this evening. He's been trying to steal Xavio's best tricks for his own show.
It must be him. Or some autograph hound. But if what you say is true I'd better
call the cops."
135682: "I know. It's a tragedy. We're going to find his murderer, whoever it
was." She glares at you.
135760: "What? Has the great man ordered room service again this evening? No
wonder he's looking a little pudgy. Well, you just go on and push the cart on
through east."
135876: Mildred is busy talking to one of the policemen and can't be bothered.
135928: Mildred seems to be listening, but really she's concentrating on her
sweater.
135984: You wake Mildred Nottinghaus and tell her that you've found Xavio
murdered. "Dead? Murdered! Who are you? Did you sneak in there while I was
asleep? I'm calling the cops right now!"
136120: She's had a long night, and you did bring her the chair. Why not let
her use it?
136180: Mildred Nottinghaus is already awake.
136208: "Well, aren't you a sweet young thing."
136240: I'm sure she'll have pleasant dreams now.
136272: "Accuse me of murder will you! I was loyal to Xavio. What you've said
is just not right! There's not a spot of evidence. I don't think you're such a
nice young man after all."
136400: "Hagerston, this young lady is correct." Mildred Nottinghaus rather
beams at being referred to as a young lady. "On what basis do you offer such a
charge? While she may have thought he didn't pay enough, now she won't have a
job at all. And if she'd intended to steal from him, she would have had several
opportunities when he was not present. I'm afraid you're not being logical at
all."
136680: Mildred Nottinghaus' canvas bag is full of yarns of various color.
136728: Really. You don't know the first thing about knitting.
136876: The sweater's only half-finished, and it's far too small for you in any
case.
136932: Mildred's knitting needle is a long, narrow piece of metal. It's pointy
at one end, and has a knob at the other.
137012: You gently ease the knitting needle from Mildred's grasp and pocket it.
137064: She's busy knitting the sweater with it. She'd probably stab you if you
tried to take her knitting needle now.
137142: This is the main room of the suite they've rented to the Great Xavio.
You had no idea hotel rooms could be this lavish. You descend two stairs to a
sunken living room with three couches, each longer than the last, and any one
of which is large enough for you to stretch out on and fall asleep. There's a
television you couldn't even get in your apartment, unless you knocked out a
wall. There's a minibar bigger than your bathroom. (Well, alright that's an
exaggeration, but not much.) Grad school just doesn't seem as much fun as it
used to.

There are three doors to other rooms: the northwest to the master
bedroom, the south to the guest bedroom, and the north to the bathroom.
137622: Dr. Todd turns to you and asks, "Hagerston, is it logical that they
call this a hotel room when it's got at least four rooms?"
137720: "Hagerston, since we got in by pretending that we were employees of
this establishment, I suggest we take the cart with us in case we need to
return, utilizing the same deceit. In general, as you know, I am opposed to
deceit, but in this case I have deduced, that the means of deceit do, in fact,
justify the ends."
137944: "Hagerston, is it logical to walk into walls? Doesn't all the evidence
of the scientific method indicate to us that we can, in fact, not pass through
walls? And aren't there four perfectly reasonable exits from this room, to the
northwest, to the west, to the north, and to the south? Isn't that a
sufficiency of valid exits? I claim that it is."
138190: Dr. Todd looks at you sadly, "Hagerston, let us examine in which
position we think best. I would contend we think best on our feet, because it
forces us to be alert."
138312: This is the longest of the couches. It could seat all the friends you
have, with a little room left over for Dr. Todd.
138396: This couch is mid-sized by the standards of the suite. Even still when
you fall asleep on it, you won't have to curl up at all.
138488: This couch is nearly laughable in its very smallness. It could probably
only hold six people.
138556: Your initial impression was that this minibar was bigger than your
bathroom. Well, maybe not. But it is definitely bigger than your kitchen.
138656: "Hagerston! I hope you don't plan to try to open that minibar in order
to take something from it. That would be theft, a most illogical activity."
You're not sure exactly how it is that theft is illogical, but then you don't
make the rules, do you?
138832: It is bigger than your kitchen, and maybe even your bathroom. Sure, if
you were a superhero, you might be able to move it, but you're just ordinary
old Hagerston.
138948: A flat screen television of truly astounding proportions.
138988: At this hour it seems to be all infomercials.
139020: "Hagerston, thank you for that. Don't you consider that the watching of
television a most illogical activity?"
139100: This silver trays seems a little too elaborate for the reuben sandwich
that's on it.
139160: The logo in the exactly center of the tray--it's the same as was on the
knife in Xavio's body!
139228: This rather elaborate silver tray held a reuben sandwich when you first
saw it. Its center features the hotel logo
139380: auerkraut, and Russian dressing, all piled on light rye, and grilled.
Tasty, in principle. And you'd read recently where fermented foods like
sauerkraut were good for you. But this particular sandwich has been there a
couple of hours, and doesn't look all that appealing.
139572: It smells like a reuben sandwich, only less so.
139608: You take a bite. It's cold and a little greasy at this point, but it's
not bad.
139668: It was still pretty good, and probably would have been very good a
couple of hours ago.
139728: The bathroom door is a solid piece of oak. Signor Fornoni did not skimp
on the costs for his hotel. The knob, while still elaborate, is more recent.
It's a round piece of brass with a tiny hole in the center.
139876: The bathroom door is locked, it appears, from the inside.
139920: Turns out the tiny hole in the doorknob is actually an emergency
release mechanism for the door.
139988: You don't actually see a keyhole exactly in the door. Unless the tiny
hole in ther center of the doorknob is supposed to be one.
140080: There's blood stains on the door handle. You decide you'd better not
touch it.
140136: The knob to the bathroom door is a solid piece of brass with a tiny
hole in the center.
140196: The hole in the center of the door knob is smaller in diameter than a
pencil.
140252: The bedroom door is solid oak.
140276: There's a door to the guest bedroom which is closed.
140316: The door to the guest bedroom is open.
140344: A scared voice responds, "Who's there? You're not a ghost are you?" You
hear the sound of furniture being pushed away from the door.
140440: There seems to be furniture piled up against the door on the inside.
You let go of the handle instantly. There must be somebody inside.
140536: It's not so much that it's locked, as somebody seems to have piled
something up against the door.
140604: This is the suite's master bedroom. The bed is enormous and charmingly
sleep-worthy. A window faces north. 

The door back to the suite's living is to
the southeast. There's a walk-in closet to the east.
140752: "Wow," is really all you can say. You contemplate its vast acres of no
doubt sleep-enticing comfort.
140874: Though it appears not to have been slept in this evening, perhaps
you're right to climb in. I will join you. It may give us some notion of his
thought processes." You leap out of the bed. Will no one rid you of this
meddlesome professor?
141044: This old-fashioned window is spotlessly clean, offering a good view
this high up.
141104: You look out the window. Off to the northwest a few headlights shine
their way across the Golden Gate bridge.
141184: You tug at the window, but you can't seem to open it. It must have been
painted shut.
141246: A hotel suite with a spare bedroom! If somebody came to visit you at
your apartment, they'd better bring their own sleeping bag.
Should you wish to
leave this room, you may do so to the north.
141384: A large nondescript dresser. Not very interesting at all.
141428: Amazing. You can't budge it. Mikey must have been really terrified to
have moved it in front of the door.
141504: Nothing of interest inside. You close it up again.
141540: The first thing you notice is a dead body. Dead bodies do have a habit
of drawing one's attention. And there's a knife sticking out of his chest.
Let's recap: you've just broken into a hotel room, in the middle of the night,
where you've discovered a dead body. Ooh, boy. You're in big trouble now.

You
take a deep breath and look around. The rest of the bathroom is just as fancy
as the rest of the suite. The faucet looks like it's real gold. But it's all
undisturbed. In fact it looks like while this guy was dying he probably crawled
in here and locked the door behind him. 

The door back to the living room is
to the south.
141988: "Hagerston! This is a crime scene! Do you think it's wise to take
evidence from a crime scene?"
142060: You decide you'd better not touch anything. It might be evidence.
142108: "Hagerston, logically speaking shouldn't we leave the evidence
undisturbed to assist in efforts of the prosecutor?"
142192: You decide you'd better not touch anything. It might be evidence.
142240: This is the first time you've actually seen the magician. It seems he
was a small blonde-haired man with an over-elaborate mustache. You don't know
what his stage costume looked like, but he'd look fairly dapper in his gray
silk pajamas, if it weren't for the knife in his chest and the coagulated blood
around it.
142460: Yick. Blood. Ooh. Gross. After getting all that out of your system, you
look at it more closely:
142536: It's really just a letter opener. It can't be very sharp. It must have
taken somebody strong to use this as a murder weapon. You recognize that it has
the hotel logo of a butterfly on its handle.
142676: It's really just a letter opener. It can't be very sharp. It must have
taken somebody strong to use this as a murder weapon. There's some logo on the
handle that looks like a bow tie. It seems like you've seen that somewhere
recently, but you're not sure.
142860: It looks fancy. Even if it's not real gold, it's probably pretty
valuable.
142916: Sure, taking the gold faucet, selling it, and leaving the country is a
plan, of sorts. But you'd need a wrench.
142996: The shower is covered in a pretty blue tile. If you had a bathroom you
were redecorating, you might consider it. Like even.
143084: The toilet is white porcelain.
143108: What? You think you're Marcel Duchamp now? Guess again. You're still
plain old Hagerston.
143176: Just the thought of looking at all that blood gives the willies, but
you steel yourself. It's coagulated and mostly dried up. He must have been
killed a while ago.
143290: You know, this walk-in closet may be bigger than your apartment. The
light turned on in some mysterious high-tech way the moment you entered.

The
exit from the closet (though you could just move in here) is to the west.
143448: The Great Xavio's street clothes. Xavio's taste in day wear runs to
designer labels and tailored shirts.
143524: They're stylish, but they're not your size.
143556: The Magic Multiplier is a large iron chest with brass bound corners.
There's a metal funnel on top that leads into its dark interior. No other way
into it is apparent.
143676: The Magic Multiplier is a large iron chest with a funnel on top; after
you pressed the button it's now open to the front.
143816: The Magic Multiplier is a large iron chest with a funnel on top; after
you pressed the button it's now open to the front.
143904: The Magic Multiplier is a large iron chest. You had earlier noted a
small almost hidden button at its base.
143980: Poking around in the interior of the box, you discovered a hidden
compartment. "Hagerston! Don't you see? This is clear proof that this Magic
Multiplier is just a trick! Here are the one dollar bills that he claimed had
been converted into one thousand dollar bills. Since they are still in the box,
he must have had a separate supply of one thousand dollar bills somewhere.
144244: And we've already found them. This has been excellent work."
144292: Wadda ya know? The magician's trick was a trick. Dr. Todd will be
thrilled. Maybe you ought to tell him he can get out of the room service cart.
144396: There's nothing left inside the Magic Multiplier's hidden compartment.
144492: Searching the outside of the Magic Multiplier reveals a small button,
previously hidden.
144556: The Magic Multiplier turns out to be quite solid. Your toe throbs
painfully.
144612: "Hagerston, that object is metallic. Does it seem at all logical to
attempt to burn it?"
144676: While you probably could lug the thing off, it's heavy. You'd be pretty
conspicuous. Your back would hurt. It doesn't seem worth it.
144772: The funnel in the top of the Magic Multiplier leads into the darkness
of its interior.
144832: You try to reach your hand into the funnel, but it doesn't fit.
Whatever was deposited in there is lost in the interior of the Magic
Multiplier.
144936: You try to reach your hand into the funnel, but it's no go. Whatever
has been dropped in there is lost in the interior of the Magic Multiplier.
145040: "Hagerston! That's the suit he wore this evening as he was perpetrating
his mumbo-jumbo."
145108: The Great Xavio's performance suit is black silk, has wide lapels and
deep pockets.
145168: Inside the lining of the left cuff, you find a hidden one thousand
dollar bill.
145224: "Hagerston! Don't you see? This is proof that it was all mumbo-jumbo!
After he took a one dollar bill from a member of the audience, he substituted
it with a one thousand dollar bill--you know, Hagerston, that among the
demimonde, a one thousand dollar bill is frequently known as a Cleveland, from
that notable president pictured on it," You roll your eyes, something you do
frequently in the presence of Dr. Todd. "That very plausibility made the trick
all the more dastardly. We've done a very good thing here, Hagerston." You sigh
with relief.
145616: You have a good feeling about this.
145644: This probably qualifies as evidence. You'd better not take it.
145692: You don't want to take the magician's suit. If he found out, he'd
probably turn you into something unspeakable.
145796: "Don't you think the responsible thing to do, Hagerston, is to leave
that bill there? It could very well be considered evidence. Our knowledge of
its existence is the most important fact." Only Dr. Todd could think that the
knowledge of a thousand dollar bill's existence was more important than its
possession, but you do leave it there.
146036: The magician would probably turn you into a toad if you started
stealing from him.
146092: Oh! It does feel good. It feels much better than a thousand times as
good as the stuff you normally have in your wallet.
146180: Genuine United States of America greenbacks. Value one dollar.
146228: The machine spits out your dollar bill in disgust.
146264: The machine cheerfully accepts your money.
146300: The small button blends into the brass coloring quite effectively. You
really had to look closely to find it.
146376: The front side of the Magic Multiplier swings open.
146416: Mikey is probably about 15, but looks 11, wears glasses, and hasn't
combed his hair. He looks terribly scared.
146498: "Hagerston, I hope you don't mind if I crawled out of the room service
trolley and followed you up here. Whatever plan you were following seemed to me
to be taking too long.
146624: There's a smallish boy here who says his name is Mikey. He looks about
11, though you hope he's at least a little older. He wears glasses, and hasn't
combed his hair since who knows when. He looks terribly scared when you first
see him, but then he points at Dr. Todd. "I saw you at the Great Xavio's show
tonight! You asked him if he wasn't ashamed to, to, to proffer all that
mumbo-jumbo. You're not a ghost."
146924: "I heard a low moaning sound coming from the bathroom. It sounded like
a ghost, so I locked myself in here, by pushing the dresser in front of the
door."
147032: "I think magic is neat! Especially that multiplier thing."
147076: "I just wanted to get his autograph after the show, but he didn't see
me because I'm so small. So I found out which hotel he was staying at by
calling them up, and coming here. I got here before he did! But then I fell
asleep on the bed here, and was only woken up by the ghost. My mom's going to
be so mad!"
147296: "You really want to go in the bathroom? That's where the ghost is!
You're very brave. But if you want to go in the bathroom, well, it's one of
those doors that locks from the inside, but you can still open it from the
outside by sticking something thin into the center of the door knob, like a
paperclip or a hairpin. But I'm going to stay here."
147544: "Do you really think it's all mumbo-jumbo? That Magic Multiplier box
that turned the little cookie lead into a giant cookie--that seemed pretty
impossible! And the cookie tasted good, too. I think he must be in league with
Sauron! Anyway, there's a ghost in his bathroom. I heard it!"
147752: "I'm sorry. I don't have a paperclip. But are you sure you really want
to go in the bathroom? Aren't you afraid of the ghost?"
147848: "I'll be 15 my next birthday! Everybody says I'm very young for my
age."
147904: "That was such a cool trick--that Magic Multiplier. It changed that
little bitty cookie into a giant one. That was so cool."
147996: "I don't think she's a very good guardian. She let me in when the Great
Xavio wasn't even here, and forgot I was here. And she let in the room service
guy when Xavio was asleep already. I smelled the food. I'm hungry! All I've
eaten this evening is part of that giant cookie. My mom's gonna kill me."
148216: "I'm really hungry. Do you have a sandwich or some other food you can
give me?"
148276: "Thanks for the phone. She's still mad, but it's better."
148320: Mikey looks at you a little puzzled. "I don't understand. You're not
turning into a ghost are you?"
148396: "Oh, thanks. I was so hungry." He scarfs it down in about two seconds.
You wonder how he stays so undersized.
148476: He rips the wrapper off the chocolate bar and wolfs it down in one
bite. "I was, like, so hungry. I missed dinner! My mom's going to to be so mad.
148584: You wouldn't have a cellphone, would you? I really should call my mom."
148640: He twists off the orange juice's cap and pours it down. "Thanks a lot.
I was afraid to leave to get something to drink because of the ghost.
148740: Can I borrow your cellphone, I mean, if you've got one? My mom's going
just kill me if I don't call her."
148820: Mikey takes your cellphone for a moment and calls his mother.
Embarassed, you try not to listen in, but it's not hard to tell she's pretty
angry. He hangs up and gives you the phone back. "Thanks. Whew. That wasn't as
bad as I feared. And it was good I called her.
149012: You know I noticed that Mildred Nottinghaus was doing a lot of
knitting. I bet you could get her knitting needle and open the bathroom door
with it."
149120: If you really, really wanted to get into the bathroom and fight the
ghost, you could probably ask at the front desk for a paperclip. I bet that's
all you'd need to get in."
149244: Have you seen that Mercouri the Magnificent? He's magic! He hangs out
in the smoke and fog and it's like he's not there, but he's right next to you!
I'd search any fog banks you find and maybe you'll find him!"
149400: You try to break it to him gently, but that turns out to be impossible.
"He's dead. You mean the ghost I was hearing was the Great Xavio dying! Oh, no!
I'll never get his autograph now."
149540: "It's terrible what happened. And my mom's going to be so mad at me.
And for what? I didn't even get his autograph."
149626: "Me? Murder? I'm scared." 
"Hagerston, is this at all logical? Didn't
you notice that the murder weapon was a letter opener? Such a dull blade
suggests at least adult strength was required to commit the murder."
149784: Mikey follows you into the suite's lounge.
149816: "Do you mind if I eat that sandwich. I'm so hungry. I haven't had
anything to eat since I had a little bit of the giant cookie. It was awfully
good, but I had to share it with all the other kids."
149960: He scarfs it down in about two bites. You wonder how he can remain so
undersized.
150020: "Do you think it's safe in here?"
150046: It's quite a nice room really, with a desk, a television, and a very
comfy-looking bed. There's a window on the north wall. There's a bathroom to
the south. 

You can go back to the hall by going west.
150196: You don't actually need to use it the facilities now.
150236: There's no way you're actually going to crawl out on that ledge. No
possible hairbrained scheme of Dr. Todd can get you to do that.
150332: There's no way you're actually going to crawl out on that ledge. No
possible hairbrained scheme of Dr. Todd can get you to do that.
150428: There's no way you're actually going to crawl out on that ledge. No
possible hairbrained scheme of Dr. Todd can get you to do that.
150524: It's a standard issue hotel room desk.
150552: The small sign reads, "Complimentary toiletries available from the
concierge. Please ask at the desk below."
150632: It's a straight-backed chair on wheels.
150664: You push the chair back and forth across the carpeted floor. If it
weren't the middle of the night you could call up some friends for a game of
office bowling.
150776: That's going to look an awful lot like you're trying to steal the
chair. Probably a bad idea.
150844: The chair's a little too large to carry. It is on wheels, though. If,
for some unintelligible reason you wanted to, you could probably push it.
150948: You try out the chair. It's good for your posture, and if it weren't
the middle of the night you might use it to write a few pages on your thesis.
151052: You push the chair along ahead of you.
151080: It's a queen-sized bed and it does look comfortable.
151120: "Hagerston. Don't you go near that bed. We're engaged in a serious
business here."
151184: It's a good-sized color television.
151212: At this hour it seems to be all infomercials.
151244: You sensibly turn the television off.
151272: The hotel's old enough that it's a window you can actually open.
151320: You look out the window, and just momentarily, it seems you can see a
man in a big floppy hat and a long cape. You look again and he's gone, if he
was ever there. He just disappeared into the wisps of fog that lurk outside the
window.
151484: You look out the window. There's a thin ledge, just barely possible as
a space to stand if what you saw wasn't a mirage. Looking out further to the
northwest you can see a few cars crossing the Golden Gate bridge.
151636: Nothing like a breath of fresh air.
151664: "Hagerston, I agree, the fog feels a little chilly tonight. It's
logical that you should close the window. We wouldn't want to catch a cold from
the night air."
151780: It's six floors up. You're just not going to do it. If that really was
a person you saw out there, they can just have the ledge all to themselves.
151884: The ledge is incredibly thin, and if you really did just see somebody
there, the person must have been truly fearless--or insane.
151974: There are three elevators here, though two are marked closed for
cleaning. There are two elevator call buttons for up and down. An indicator
light shows which floor the elevator is currently at.

The door to the elevator
is to the south. You can return to the lobby to the north.
152172: "Hagerston, let us examine the course of action you are about to
undertake. Isn't it likely that the concierge will be familiar with all the
employees of this hotel? And isn't it true, that by wearing the uniform of the
hotel, you are attempting to pass for an employee of this establishment? Do not
these two suppositions contradict one another? If you agree with my premises,
then I am sure you, too, will come to the clearly logical conclusion that to
enter the hotel lobby while wearing the staff uniform is a bad idea."
152536: You're sleepy, but not so sleepy as to start walking into walls.
152582: The elevator poings and the door opens.
152614: The elevator poings and the door opens.
152668: to 8. A quick glance shows the elevator is at the
152704: The elevator is nondescript and boringly modern, but probably safer
than the original elevators. At its side there's an up button, as well as a
floor indicator.
152816: The elevator is nondescript and boringly modern, but probably safer
than the original elevators. At its side there is a down button, as well as a
floor indicator.
152932: The elevator is nondescript and boringly modern, but probably safer
than the original elevators. There are buttons for the basement, the lobby, and
the first through eighth floors. The buttons for the top three floors are
surrounded by a gold box. A discreet note suggests that you insert your key in
the adjacent slot for the executive suite floors.
153176: The elevator is nondescript and boringly modern, but probably safer
than the original elevators. At its side there are up and down buttons, as well
as a floor indicator.
153296: You use your superhuman strength to pry the elevator doors apart! Oh,
wait--you don't have superhuman strength...
153378: The elevator has buttons for 8 floors. A sign above the bank of buttons
says, 'For executive suite floors, please insert room key.' A gold box
highlights each of the top three floors.

The door to exit the elevator faces
north.
153582: or the Lobby, and 2 through 8 for the floors above. The buttons for 6,
7 and 8 are surrounded by a little gold box to indicate that they are executive
suite floors. Ooh, la, la. There's a slot here which, if you insert your room
key, you can press the button to go to the executive suite floors.
153792: A slot at the top of the bank of buttons. It's just about the width of
a hotel room key.
153854: The hotel has an old wood bar with a mirror behind it and a couple of
bar stools. There's also a couple of tables. It's closed and, except for the
light you're carrying, dark now. 

The hotel lobby is to the west.
154008: There are probably candles on every table in the bar, but you noticed
this one. It's hardly been used at all.
154088: You light the candle with one of your matches.
154120: You can't light the candle with that.
154148: The old wooden bar is stained and burnt in numerous locations.
154192: You find a hotel room key inside an envelope. Somebody must have
forgotten it here. You decide to take it. There's no telling which room it goes
to, however. There's also a champagne glass.
154328: The mirror behind the bar is slightly warped and even pitted in one
place. It must be original to the hotel. It's amazing it lasted this long.
154428: You find nothing of interest. Unfortunately, that also includes
yourself.
154480: The tables and chairs in the bar area are a mismatched lot. Most of the
tables have a candle on them.
154552: There are several stools lined up at the bar. They have a too short
back and no cushion. Chances are you couldn't successfully fall asleep in one.
154656: If you carried the barstool back through the lobby, you'd look mighty
suspicious. You decide to just leave it there.
154740: Now you recognize the design on the knife: it's the Hotel Farfalla
logo!
154792: A plastic rectangle with a magnetic strip on one side. On the other it
features the Farfalla Hotel logo, which you identify as a butterfly. The room
number isn't printed anywhere. Somebody lost it, but you have no way of telling
what room they are in.
154968: Your cellphone is neither as small nor as feature-laden as you might
like. At least it was cheap. You have pre-programmed a couple of quick dial
numbers, 1 for Dr. Todd at his office, and 2 for Dr. Todd at home. Your mother,
back home in Ontario, is 3. Det. Vukovich of the Berkeley police force is 4.


Why you actually have the phone number of a homicide detective on the
Berkeley police force preprogrammed into your cellphone is a long and
uncomfortable story that you can't really explain, and prefer not to think
about. It has to do (what in your life doesn't?) with Dr. Todd.
155388: You hear a Muzak version of Queen's 'We Are The Champions' coming from
the vicinity of your right pocket.
155468: "Hagerston, I suggest to you that it is logical to answer your
cellphone when it rings in that way. Or, in fact, in any way."
155560: Your poor, sad, far too thin wallet. Alas for the life of a graduate
student.
155616: What? You suddenly think a credit card is mysteriously going to appear
in here? Fat chance. You're an impoverished graduate student. Now if you were a
rich professor...
155740: Once again you discover that it does not contain the picture of some
fantastically good-looking significant other.
155820: That doesn't fit in your billfold.
155848: Your University of California at Berkeley student identification. It
reads D. Hagerston. Even in the middle of the night you can't bear to look at
the picture.
156236: whether your, or (better) Dr. Todd's presence, is irritating him.
156288: Det. Vukovich thumps in. "Hagerston," he bellows. "This had better be
good. Or I will personally arrest you for malingering.
156384: " He looks at the corpse. "Alright, this is good. I just hope the two
of you did nothing more to this stiff than find him. I'm out of my jurisdiction
here. I'm going to call up the locals. I'd better stay here at least until they
come."
156556: Maybe you'd better lead me to this body of yours." He jerks his thumb
at Dr. Todd, "Sure, he could try to prove things to me logically, but I'm an
empiricist. I like to see things for myself."
156698: "Alright, Hagerston, this wasn't a false alarm. I don't have
jurisdiction here, so I got to call up the locals. Hang on." He whips out his
cellphone and calls somebody. "They're on their way. I'll guard the crime
scene. And don't you wander very far away. You're in enough trouble as it is."
156916: Vukovich seems to know Pollacks and greets him, then turns to you.
"Alright, Hagerston, this wasn't a false alarm. I see somebody's already called
the local boys, but I'll just stick around here to see if I can help. Don't
leave the building. The two of you are in enough trouble as it is."
157128: Det. Vukovich is suspiciously waiting for you to show him something.
157176: Detective Vukovich merely grunts at you. "Hagerston," Dr. Todd says, "I
think it's better if we pursue our own course and then ACCUSE the perpetrator
of this vile deed. Let Detective Vukovich work in the way he knows best."
157344: Det. Vukovich has been sucked into the bustle of police work. Whenever
you draw his attention he glares at you, then goes back to it.
157440: Det. Vukovich glares at you. "Hagerston. Is this some sick joke of
yours? You're just in the way. Hey, Morning Star," he waves over a Native
American cop, "Take these two down to the station and keep them there until I
say they can get out."
157620: Some otherwise non-descript detectives from the San Francisco police
force. Their badges read Hooke and Pollacks. They look more likely to haul you
down to the police station than to help you out.
157760: The cops appear and you explain to them that you discovered the dead
body of the Great Xavio. They tell you not to leave the premises, but
afterwards they pay no more attention to you and start immediately examining
the body.
157916: You explain to the cops that you were a little hasty in calling and
that really there's nothing wrong. They scowl a bit, but take it surprisingly
well. "That's alright. That's our job. We're here to help. Don't hesitate to
call if you've got real trouble." They go back to their normal nighttime
business.
158136: A couple of San Francisco homicide detectives walk in. One of them,
Hooke, asks you suspiciously, "How'd the two of you get in here in the first
place?"
Before you can even think of a sensible excuse, Dr. Todd has begun to
answer him. If it really is an answer. "Isn't it true that I am his professor?
And that Hagerston here is my student? Isn't it therefore logical that we
should arrive together in pursuit of a pedagogical goal?"
"Get a load of these
two, Pollacks," he shakes his head. "Alright, get out of here, but don't leave
the hotel, until we talk to you."
158552: The detectives glare at you suspiciously on their way to start their
investigation.
158612: Hooke jingles his handcuffs in a significant way.
158648: Pollacks barks at you, "What are you doing in here? Get out of the
way!"
158704: "Give me some room here," Hooke glares. "But don't leave the building."
158760: The cops are busy going about their work and wave you away.
"Hagerston," Dr. Todd says, "I think it's better if we pursue our own course
and then ACCUSE the perpetrator of this vile deed."
158900: The cops are too busy with the body of the Great Xavio to pay you much
mind.
158956: The cops suspiciously watch Max Zlotzky and pay no attention to you.
159004: Hooke looks at you in disbelief. "You gonna accuse one of us of murder?
Alright, buddy, I don't know who you are or what you're doing around here, but
you're in the way. You're going in to the station." Hooke drags both you and
Dr. Todd down to the station, where you neither eat nor sleep for another
twelve hours.
159232: Two beat officers from the San Francisco police force. The short one's
name Clubb, and the tall one is Pyke. They don't look very friendly.
159336: One of them, you think it's Pyke, grunts, then the other says, "Shut
up. We're keeping an eye on this guy."
159420: Clubb looks at you in disbelief. "You gonna accuse one of us of murder?
Alright, buddy, I don't know who you are or what you're doing around here, but
you're in the way. You're going in to the station." Hooke drags both you and
Dr. Todd down to the station, where you neither eat nor sleep for another
twelve hours.
159648: "Locked locks could I loosen lightly. But not for you. Offended am I!"
159704: You explain about the locker and padlock you saw in the staff room.
"Well, Mercouri the Magnificent can make minced meat of a simple padlock. Lead
the way to this locker of yours and I will liberate it!"
159848: "Mercouri the Magnificent smiles a smile of satisfaction."
159892: There's a man here dressed in a long, midnight blue cape, and a hat
that wouldn't have been out of place in a Three Musketeers movie. Underneath
all the sartorial flourish, though, he's actually quite petite.
160040: With a bright flash and a cloud of smoke, the caped man disappears! You
hear, "Mysterious magician melts away," after he's gone.
160136: "Awful accusations advanced about others annoy if verity has vamoosed.
Offended am I!"
160198: "Hagerston," Dr. Todd looks at you glaringly, "This gentleman is right.
Is it logical to loosely bandy about accusations of murder? Isn't it correct
that we should first attempt to establish evidence of guilt before making such
serious accusations? Hagerston, I am disappointed by your failure to understand
the logical method and apply it properly. It is almost a reflection on my
teaching."
160478: With a swish of his cape and a sudden flash, Mercouri the magnificent
disappears!
160540: "Mercouri the Magnificent's mind is maimed by your muddle."
160584: With a bright flash and a cloud of smoke, the caped man disappears! You
hear, "Mysterious magician melts away." after he's gone.
160680: "Mercouri the Magnificent's mind is maimed by your muddle."
160724: "Mercouri the Magnificent can magick much: pigeons produced, locked
locks loosened, voices invisibly ventriloquized, scarves sneakily supplied,
lovely ladies levitated..."
160848: "Pointed parallels polish the periods of speech..."
160888: Dr. Todd looks at you, "Hagerston, I rely on your facility with words.
Is it logical to confuse assonance and alliteration in this way?" You shrug,
hopefully knowingly.
161012: "The xanthous Xavio is at the zenith of his trade. By comparison I am a
mere zero in a zoot suit. But better will I be!"
161200: Nevertheless, I deem he did not do the devilish deed."
161240: His innocent appearance enabled his entry."
161272: "This concierge contributes no capacious quantity to the upkeep of the
hotel. Seems to this self suspicious."
161352: "Mercouri the Magnificent's mind is maimed by your muddle."
161396: "Mercouri the Magnificent's mind is multiplied by what you mention."
161448: With a bright flash and a cloud of smoke, the caped man disappears! You
hear, "Mysterious magician melts away." after he's gone.
161544: With a bright flash and a cloud of smoke, the caped man disappears! You
hear, "Mysterious magician melts away." after he's gone.
161640: With a bright flash and a cloud of smoke, the caped man disappears! You
hear, "Mysterious magician melts away." after he's gone.
161736: With a bright flash and a cloud of smoke, the caped man disappears! You
hear, "Mysterious magician melts away." after he's gone.
161832: "Ah, Mercouri the Magnificent will master this momentarily!" He pulls
two small wires from inside his cape and sets to work. It only takes him a
couple of minutes and the locker is unlocked.
161968: Like you need a description of your own mother. Well, she'd probably
tell you, you haven't been home anywhere often enough recently, so maybe you
do.
162076: The greatest bank robber in Canadian history, a man of many disguises,
a genial raconteur at parties, and your mother's father's younger brother. Yes,
he's your great-uncle Basset.
162208: Now you recognize the design on the knife: it's the Hotel Farfalla
logo!
162260: A plastic rectangle with a magnetic strip on one side. On the other it
features the Farfalla Hotel logo, which you identify as a butterfly. The room
number isn't printed anywhere. If you didn't know it was for room 607, you'd
have no way of finding out.
162444: You need both your hands to carry the tray when you've got things on
it. You're not going to be able to do much of anything that way.
162540: "Hagerston, do you think it logical to move around rooms in the
darkness?"
162596: You'd hate to strain your eyes squinting in the dark. Eyestrain is
already a problem staring at computers all day.
162676: You'd been soundly sleeping, comfortably, soundly sleeping, when Dr.
Todd called. He's your thesis adviser, and as such, he holds unconscionable
power over you, which he uses for, well, whatever he likes, really.
"Hagerston," he'd said. (You do have a first name, but no, nobody ever uses
it.) "You do think it's important we apply our brains in a logical way, and not
yield to mumbo-jumbo and mystification?" You acknowledged this was true. With
Dr. Todd, a bad idea. The result was you agreed to meet him in front of the
Hotel Farfalla at 3 AM. There was some reason, perfectly logical according to
Dr. Todd, for this request, but you can't for the life of you now remember what
it was.

[First time players may want to type ABOUT]
163220: "Hagerston, may I suggest that it is more logical to press the floor
button from inside the elevator?"
163292: "Hagerston, I'm glad to see that you believe in practice, but really
isn't an elevator a perfectly logical and easy to use apparatus?"
163388: The button's light flashes briefly, but nothing happens.
163480: The vending machine says, "Thank you." Your purchase is delivered in
the opening.
163580: It's a talking vending machine. It says, "That item is sold out."
163632: "Hagerston, may I suggest that it is more logical to press the floor
button from inside the elevator?"
163704: Use call or dial to operate your cellphone.
163784: First inserting your room key in the slot, you push the button.
163880: The button's light flashes briefly, but nothing happens.
163972: Try dialing a number or the name of one of preprogrammed contacts
you've set up in your phone.
164040: Where have you left your cellphone?
164068: Detective Vukovich is in the building!
164096: You've already called him. Nothing to do now but wait.
164136: The phone rings and nobody answers. You have a bad feeling about this.
164186: You dial his number, but then hang up immediately. Detective Vukovich
already thinks you're a bit of a clown--and maybe he's right. You feel a bit
like Stan Laurel to Todd's Oliver Hardy. Except he's the thin one, and oh,
well, we could all lose a few pounds.
164378: You decide you have to call up Detective Vukovich. "Hagerston, what in
hell are you doing calling me up in the middle of the night?" You realize you
don't really have an answer. "Todd put you up to this didn't he? Don't answer
that. I know the answer." He hangs up.
164574: "Hagerston, you got something to tell the a cop, you call 911. It's the
middle of the night. And you tell Dr. Todd, because I know he put you up to
this, that the next time I see him on the streets of Berkeley I will personally
arrest him for something, anything--loitering, jaywalking, being a public
nuisance. I will find a charge. Go home and go to bed. Now. Quit calling me."
164854: You decide to call Det. Vukovich. He is a homicide detective, after
all. The phone at the other end rings a very long time, an alarmingly long
time, before Vukovich grunts into his receiver. You'd almost hung up, and then
after he answers, you babble, "He's dead. They killed him." Vukovich must have
recognized your voice because he barks, "What? Professor Todd's dead?" He
sounded almost hopeful. That thought--pleasant as it may be--brings you to
coherence, and you explain how and why you found the body of The Great Xavio.
Explaining, you realize your story makes no sense at all, that you had broken
into a hotel in the middle of the night to prove that a magician was performing
magic tricks, but since Vukovich knows Todd, too, he doesn't question it. He
says he's on his way.
165420: Detective Vukovich is on his way!
165448: "Hagerston, does it seem logical for you to call me when you can see
that I'm right here in front of you?"
165524: You call up your mom and explain about the locked staff locker and how
you need to get into it. "Well, it just so happens Uncle Basset is here at the
moment. I'll put him on. He can probably help." You wait a moment and then your
great-uncle Basset comes to the phone. "Trying to break into something in the
middle of the night, eh? Following in my footsteps, are you, lad? It was a good
career for me, and whenever you lose your job, you get room and board at the
Queen's expense. Not bad, eh?" He's always like that. 

You explain the padlock
to him. "What you need's a bicycle spoke and a file. Find those and call me
back, eh. I can probably talk you through it."
166004: You call up your mom and she puts Great Uncle Basset on the line. "Ah,
my boy, it makes me feel young again, just to have my hand in, even vicariously
like this. I'm so glad you called." In no time at all, he's talked you through
the process of picking the lock. Maybe all those stories about bank robbing
weren't just so much hooey. "Isn't it a good feeling when it comes open, eh?"
166280: Your great uncle Basset picks up the phone. "You don't have the tools
yet, my boy. Can't do a job without the proper tools, eh, now can you? Give me
a call back when you're ready. I'm looking forward to it."
166432: You tell your mom about how that miserable Dr. Todd has woken you up in
the middle of the night in order to pursue some miserable goose chase, and how
you haven't got any sleep, and it's all so pointless, and he's ruining your
life. She makes a few sympathetic noises, then finally says, "Hagerston," even
your mom calls you Hagerston now, and it feels a little weird, but there it is,
"Do you know what time it is here?" and then hangs up. Maybe even mom can't
make this one better.
166776: You've already called them. Nothing to do now but wait.
166868: You've already called them. Nothing to do now but wait.
166908: You tell the dispatcher that you've just found a body in the Hotel
Farfalla, and that it looks like murder. The dispatcher tells you that she's
sent several officers on their way immediately.
167044: You make up a story that doesn't seem very convincing about why the
police should come to the hotel. It works anyway. The dispatcher promises that
two of San Francisco's finest are on their way.
167180: "Hagerston, don't you think that with the proper application of the
logical method, we can solve these problems ourselves? Is there any need to
seek outside information?"
167300: Three digit phone numbers are pretty much limited to 911 and 411.
167352: If you'd read the contract, you might have an idea how much you're
going to get charged for long distance calls. As it is, you decide you can't
afford it.
167464: International calls! Who can afford that on a grad student's budget!
167516: You don't want to call up some stranger. It's the middle of the night!
167568: "Hagerston, the book of matches is not currently on fire. And I'm sure
you will agree with me, that's a good thing."
167656: "Hagerston, really, do you think that's a logical action at this time?"
167708: That's not something you can knock.
167736: "Excuse me, sir, but haven't you already rented a room from us for this
evening?"
167936: vero? Subito, signore." He turns his attention back to you, "I'm sorry.
I hadn't meant to speak Italian to you.
168024: Yes, I have a lovely room available on the sixth floor, one of the
executive suite floors. If I could just see your credit card?"
168116: I'll just need to see a credit card."
168180: People are generally a mystery, aren't they?
168212: Unlocking generally requires a key of some sort.
168248: You begin to stretch, but Dr. Todd interrupts, "Hagerson, while I do
think it is logical that you attempt to shed a few pounds, we currently have a
mission." You scowl at Dr. Todd, but he's always been blithely impervious to
your scowls.
168420: You do a few jumping jacks. OK, enough of that.
169584: mcom. I'd love to hear any comments you have.
169618: Have you found the hints? There's two ways to get suggestions. Try
THINKing in different locations or situations. Also try, ASK TODD FOR HELP, and
he might have something to say, depending on where you are. Do you still want
to see the walkthrough?

Version two
was much improved by the reviews after the 2004 IF Competition. Thanks all.


Version three incorporated more post competition reviews. Particular thanks
are due to Andrew Krywaniuk.
173248: "Hagerston, I am disappointed on two counts: first, that you have even
attempted to acquire such a dubious skill. Is it logical to learn how to pick
locks when the process is, as it reasonably should be, illegal? But second,
having decided to learn such a logically dubious skill, you have done so badly.
That is definitely not the sign of my instruction."
173500: "Finding a file is feasible on the first floor." Just that message, and
then whoever it was hung up.
173572: "Finding a file is feasible on the fifth floor." Just that message, and
then whoever it was hung up.
173644: "Festering falsities are flung only by foes. Friends are we not, but
foemen forever!" That was it and then he hung up. The dial tone tone returns to
your phone. Who could that be? you wonder.
173784: "Stupid statements of suspicion sap sociability."
173820: "Offended was I, but aggression allievates anger against awful
accusation."
173876: You answer your cell phone. "Perseverance pays premiums.
Congratulations on coup I could not accomplish." Just that, and then the caller
disconnected.
173984: There's nobody on the line. All you hear is a dial tone.
174028: You hear a voice from behind the door to the extra bedroom to the
