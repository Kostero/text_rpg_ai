hastily wipe off the offending build-up.

85495: Currently, your mystic powers don't seem to be working.

85645: You speak the chant, but something sounds wrong. Nothing happens this
time.
85703: Nothing happens.
85944: Your training is such that you can only prepare such a chant with the
aid of a prayer book containing it.
86006: You have no text of that chant to copy.
86034: You haven't prepared that chant, if indeed it is a chant.
86078: You haven't access to that chant, if indeed it is a chant.
86215: There is a brief, blinding flash of light.
86247: The chant, not designed for living creatures, is denied.
86290: The chant fails.
86468: You are caught up in the collective chanting, and cannot break your
concentration to do much of anything else.
86547: Brother Joseph now speaks directly to the entire Order.

"Fellow
Brothers, the year, as you know, is 976 GUE. A difficult time indeed. Ten years
have passed since the Cataclysm brought forth by the Circle of Enchanters
changed our world forever. The outside world as we know it is in turmoil. A
period of great change is upon all of us."
86764: Brother Joseph continues speaking.

"Our order has always maintained the
strictest secrecy. Few outside of our order know of our existence. We are the
keepers of the mystic balance that which embodies pure magic that can keep our
world safe. It has always been thus -- we watch over all of Quendor, never
interfering in the affairs of others, yet striving to maintain harmony."
86995: Brother Joseph continues speaking.

"But we can no longer depend on
enchantments to keep outsiders at bay. Magic as we know it is dying. The
dreaded Age of Science is already upon us, and in short time, our order will be
discovered, and the balance will be no more. Many of our order have gone out
into the world in secret, in attempts to repair what has been broken, but alas,
this appears to be impossible."
87250: o.
Brother Joseph continues.

"I have brought you all forth today to say
that although we cannot protect the future of Quendor, we can protect
ourselves!" He holds the Rod of the Ancients high. "This holy Rod, which the
Ancient Ones used to defeat the demon Anabais, has the power to protect our
order. I have discovered a lost mystic cube!" He holds a white, featureless
cube high in his other hand. "This cube, when joined with the Rod of the
Ancients, will preserve our order forever, sequestering all of us in another
time, another place!"
87587: papm
There is a momentous pause. 

Brother Joseph looks at the entire
Order. "May the Gods smile down upon us on this day! We go now, into the
unknown!" He triumphantly joins the white cube to the end of the Rod of the
Ancients.

There is a sudden, blinding white flash! The chanting is instantly
broken by a tremendous thunderclap! Brother Joseph is suddenly thrown back by a
great force, and to your horror, the Rod of the Ancients breaks apart! Four
pieces now float serenely above the altar, above a strange black globe that
seems to crackle with energy.

"AT LAST!"

The voice comes from nowhere and
everywhere. The black sphere pulsates with lightning.

"ANABAIS IS FREE AGAIN!"
The voice pauses. "I see you found my fake mystic cube Joseph. I knew that
someday, someone would find it, and free me from my prison!" The voice pauses
again. "To show my gratitude, I'm scattering this broken symbol to the corners
of the world!" The pieces of the rod suddenly disappear!

"Watch out!" someone
cries. The black sphere suddenly expands with alarming speed. Seconds later, a
violent explosion seems to jar the very ground you stand on, and a black void
covers all.

You awaken in your room in a cold sweat. Was it all a terrible
dream? The day beckons...
88384: You'll have to get off the sleeping pallet first.
88433: You are surprised by a cold blast of wind as you leave the Monastery!
88497: You are greeted by relatively warm and cozy air.
88539: That's been in the Monastery for years. People would be upset if you
took it.
88600: As you place the sphere in the brazier, you feel a strange sensation.
Suddenly, the brazier is filled with
88729: No, wait, it's empty again. You hastily withdraw the sphere, and try to
clear your mind.
88787: That doesn't seem quite appropriate.
88823: You detect the faint odor of brimstone.
88850: Brother Joseph is here, standing by the altar.
88887: Your blow sends Brother Joseph staggering back.

Brother Joseph gets up
and brushes himself off, and glares at you. Ro-roo, I think you made him mad.
You remember, of course, that Brother Joseph is a renowned full-contact martial
artist?

"Impudent wretch! I'll show you how we deal with non-believers
here!"

Suddenly, Brother Joseph produces a gigantic mallet from beneath his
robes and clobbers you into a pulp.
89132: "Don't leave the Monastery without it!"
89166: Joseph smiles. "I believe we've been introduced."
89210: "We must recover the Rod before it is too late!"
89294: "Study the holy scriptures, and you will be rewarded."
89340: "I fear I know not where his feet now tread."
89373: "I don't know anything about that. Perhaps you should consult our
library upstairs?"
89454: "Have you succeeded in retrieving the Rod? If so, do what you feel is
right."
89559: Joseph takes the rod piece.
89593: "The Order will remember your acts of bravery forever," Joseph says, as
he brings out all four rod pieces and tries to join them together. A sudden
burst of light blinds you!

When you can see again, a large black sphere of
malevolent energy floats nearby! Joseph, either dead or stunned, lies in one
corner of the room. The four rod pieces are floating above the
sphere.

"Foolish little priest," a evil voice says in you mind. "You have only
brought upon yourself your own undoing. With my rod returned by an innocent,
the pact is complete. Come forth, my brothers, for our time of power is at
hand!"

The last thing you hear is mocking laughter, before the world as you
know it comes to a close.
90015: "Well done, brave Priest!" he says.
90045: Joseph looks at the rod piece and seems puzzled. "This isn't any part of
the Rod of the Ancients that I've ever seen. And yet, it seems similar." He
hands it back to you. "In this, my teachings can help you no further."
90181: Joseph waves off your offering. "You may need that in your quest."
90230: i6 toifk :nJoseph smiles. "Hello."
90260: At the moment, Joseph seems to be preoccupied with spiritual matters.
90307: Brother Joseph stops you in mid-chant. "That won't be necessary"
90359: Joseph smiles as you enter. "I'm glad you found me. As you know, thanks
to the old fool standing before you, the demon Anabais is loose upon the world
once more. He has broken the Rod of the Ancients which was keeping our house
and Order protected from outsiders. It is a sorry day for us all." Joseph
pauses for a moment. "You are our final hope in a time of chaos. Brothers
Palemon, TuffBerry and Toolbox have left the Order, and only you remain. I must
now ask you to serve the Order which you have so faithfully served in the past.
No short order this, for our continued existence depends on it, but you must go
out into a world gone mad alone, and retrieve the four broken pieces of the Rod
of the Ancients, and return them here to me, so that we can rid the world of
the evil we have loosed!"

Brother Joseph pauses and searches his
robes.

"Here, you will need this," he says, giving you a strange amulet.
"Without this amulet, the Ancient Ones cannot give you the mystic aid that you
will most certainly need. But I waste much time. Go now, and may the Gods smile
upon us all."
91019: As you place the amulet around your neck, you feel a strange sense of
mystic power.
91112: You uncover a vial of holy water.
91143: You might want to try drinking it instead.
91180: You quaff the holy water with a simple ceremony. You feel physically and
spiritually refreshed.
91340: . To the west, a small secret door in the wall leads into darkness
91377: . The exit is south.
91399: You can't go that way.
91440: Pushing the west wall reveals a hidden secret door! You've been in these
quarters before, but certainly never noticed anything like this!
91526: Nothing happens.
91557: Oddly, a section of the west wall feels slightly thin.
91599: Your sermon goes unheard.
91621: Well, I know you like listening to yourself, but isn't this a bit much?
91666: You give a wonderful sermon about how one's future affects one's past,
but no one seems to be listening.
91739: Your sermon goes unheard.
91761: A preacher boring himself to sleep with his own sermon? This doesn't
seem prudent.
91916: You'll have to consult the sacred book by individual section.
91976: "THE SACRED DOCTRINES OF THE ORDER OF BALANCE:

Thou shalt strive to
achieve balance in a world filled with unbalance.
Thou shalt pray to the
Deities in moments of inner reflection.
Thou shalt not harm innocents nor aid
them -- this is the way of balance."
92174: "Fear not, mortal men
though your world be filled with demons
and the
wicked.

Thou alone can prevail
as The Ancient Ones
against Anabais, the
trickster
were victorious."
92298: "Before the dawn of time, know that our world was filled with evil
spirits of the elements, until mankind came upon the land and vanquished them
forever."
92405: "If one is true of doubts, then a believer in the great Harmony can draw
upon the powers of the Ancients and perform feats of mystic power anywhere.
Remember that in so doing, thou must act only as the channel of mystical power
for the Ancient Ones."
92574: "Let not the ways of the mortal life dissuade the knowledge of higher
and lower planes of existence.

For, beyond mortal reach are places where those
who have truly served the Order and those who have truly forsaken the Harmony
of Balance will find themselves in death. These are the Ethereal Plane of Atrii
and the plane of the damned -- Hades."
92794: "Trust in The Ancient Ones, those Three who showed mankind the way of
Balance and Harmony."
92866: "Anabais foresaw his own demise when he dared to challenge the Ancient
Ones. From powers of light and darkness, the Ancient Ones constructed that holy
Rod that we know only as the Rod of the Ancients, and did smite the demon
Anabais so grievously, that they did imprison him in that very Rod, where he
could do no harm. This very Rod was made of pieces of ancient elemental energy,
once separated. Only the powers of the Ancients could bring them together."
93145: There doesn't seem to be a section about that.
93189: The scriptures are surrounded by a yellow glow. To your horror, the tome
evaporates into nothing!
93475: Well, if you insist. The ground breaks most of the bones in your body,
including the important ones.
93535: You float downwards gracefully, into the waiting jaws of a winter dire
wolf.
93648: Someone has left a rose-colored window open and some snow drifts in.
93693: A large rose-colored window lets some light in.
93732: A window opens into the steeple proper.
93759: A large rose-colored window is partially covered with snow here.
93869: Unfortunately, the window opens inward, and the latch and handle are on
the inside.
93931: You turn and yank the window handle and pull. A rush of wind and snow
greets you as you open the window.
94006: It doesn't seem to want to stay shut. You can't quite reach the window
latch from out here.
94065: The window glass remains unmarred. It's probably made of that especially
thick lead-glass that the Monastery got because Brother Toolbox kept
complaining about drafts.
94201: The window looks out into a winter wonderland.
94239: Even the faintest lingering scent of Borphbelly stew is enough to make
you feel like fasting.
94303: The lingering scent of Borphbelly stew is stronger here, unfortunately.
94398: The table is now covered in a waxy film. All things considered, it
actually looks cleaner now.
94478: A tiny mouse scurries into view, then disappears under a barrel.
94543: You can't go that way.
94574: The barrel is covered with a light waxy film.
94609: The barrel is far too bulky to take.
94637: You'd probably need a hacksaw to do that. Besides, look what it says it
contains.
94716: Well whaddya know, a trapdoor...
94751: A trapdoor opens into darkness below.
94778: There is a closed trapdoor in the floor here.
94855: Light gleams in from an open trapdoor above.
94884: You notice a closed trapdoor in the ceiling.
94950: You are in a large open cavern. The rough limestone here was probably
eroded by underground springs to form the somewhat circular chamber you now
stand in. Oddly, there seems to have been a recent cave-in, as piles of rubble
line the walls. A tunnel snakes off to the west
95110: . To the southeast, there is a wide square hole!
95227: As you enter the tunnel, a strange light surrounds you! The four rod
pieces you were carrying crumble into dust!
95295: Well, the hole to the southeast seems obvious enough. But, some
mysterious force blocks the way! Try as you might, you can't seem to enter it!
95391: I presume you have a blow-torch handy?
95426: Not surprisingly, it doesn't move an inch.
95458: It's flush with the rock floor.
95482: The wall seems to absorb and nullify all magic!
95514: You are standing on the top of a peak of the Gray Mountains. A cold wind
blows snow everywhere, obscuring what would otherwise surely be a wonderful
view of the surrounding countryside. You can just make out some buildings to
the far south in Frostham. A snowy bluff marks the way back down
95678: mlpround o,, or to the west, there appears to be a snowy outcropping. It
seems to hang precariously over the edge of the mountain, however.
95775: Looks like the outcropping completely collapsed!
96035: You carefully make your way onto the outcropping.
96070: Not advisable, it's probably a long way down...
96119: There is an ominous creaking noise somewhere underfoot.
96154: Some snow falls off the outermost edge of the outcropping.
96240: That's not a very sound idea.
96269: Let's not be suicidal.
96316: You must have disturbed something! The entire outcropping breaks away in
an avalanche, and you plummet to your death!
96427: As you reach for the scroll, the entire outcropping lurches alarmingly!
Without warning, it breaks away in an avalanche, and you plummet to your death!
96518: As you reach for the scroll, you hear a disturbing rumbling from
somewhere underfoot, and you step back hastily.
96598: To who/whom, exactly?
96623: You give the best bellow you can muster, given the current weather
conditions.
96675: Understandable, given the weather conditions.
96704: Unfortunately, you seem to have disturbed something, as the entire
outcropping gives way in a brief but powerful avalanche! You tumble through the
air, followed by a large quantity of snow! But suddenly, you see the Monastery
steeple rushing up to meet you!

THUMP!

You lie dazed for a moment.
Miraculously, the dirty scroll lands next to you!
96939: There is a dirty scroll here, practically buried in the snow!
96978: There is a dirty scroll here.
97007: The chant, looking for a locus of spiritual energy, fails.
97042: The general vicinity seems pretty free of spirits now.
97078: This odd stone structure, partially covered in snow, looks quite old and
mysterious. It's about seven feet tall, and is shaped like an obelisk
97236: As you place the rod piece in the broken stone piece, you sense a force
from above pull you skywards! In moments, you are high above the snow covered
mountains, nearing the sky, which you notice is strangely purple!
97419: You clamber up the tree.
97482: You take aim, but miss.
97530: You can't reach it.
97552: From down here, it's hard to see anything but the bottom of the nest.
97606: It must weight a ton.
97638: You drape the pallet over the boulder.
97712: . There appears to be an egg in it
97793: It's way out on a thinner branch that probably won't support your
weight.
97845: You can't quite reach it to put anything in it.
97892: You can't reach it.
97912: It seems to be sitting on some branches.
97969: You can't reach it.
97998: It seems to be in a nest.
98037: Good toss! A bit too strong though. With a dull crack, your throw breaks
the egg, and pieces of shell and egg goop fall to the ground below.
98136: The egg breaks easily, covering you with egg goop. What a mess.
98196: You give the branches a good shake. The egg pops free and tumbles to the
ground below! You see the egg land in a soft patch of snow, and roll down the
slope! Moments later, you hear a dull
98341: You give the branches a good yank. A bit of snow falls.
98383: It melts into nothing soon after.
98411: It's crisply cold.
98452: Remembering where the stone marker top fell, you brush aside some snow.
Sure enough, there it is!
98536: You scatter the sand onto the ice.
98576: You slide and flounder helplessly on the ice!
98606: You tread lightly on the sand covered portion of the ice, and scramble
to the south bank.
98664: You bravely jump, but without warning, the ice cracks in many places,
and you fall into the freezing river, becoming a human popsicle in a short
amount of time.
98836: You bravely jump, but without warning, the ice cracks in many places,
and you fall into the freezing river, becoming a human popsicle in a short
amount of time.
98950: You are at the northern outskirts of Frostham. The city proper is to the
south. A few snow covered residences are nearby. A trail leads into a valley to
the north
99047: mtprangn.

The last time you saw Frostham was before you entered the
Monastery -- many years ago at least. Oddly, it seemed bigger and less desolate
then.
99170: This appears to be a small grocery store, strangely abandoned at the
moment. Shelves line the walls, although, since no one is minding the store,
the current stock seems to be a bit depleted. You notice an exit south marked
"EMPLOYEES ONLY" that appears to lead to
99367: The way back out is to the northwest.
99411: You pull back before falling into what appears to be a deep pit of some
sort beyond the south exit.
99489: You hear a grinding noise from behind you.
99526: It's rather heavy.
99546: It's heavy, but you manage to make it slide along the floor a bit.
99602: A portion of the door seal blocks the crate from going outside.
99651: You give the crate a good shove.
99698: You give the crate a good shove.
99743: You give the crate a good shove.
99799: You give the crate a good shove.
99842: You're at the north end of a short N-S hall. The hallway
99889: slopes sharply upwards to the south. You notice two dark doorways above
you along the northern wall, one above the other, but no obvious means of
getting to them
99988: travels evenly to the south. You notice a dark doorway above you along
the northern wall, but no obvious means of getting to it
100090: . To the north is an exit.
100114: mtprangn
The hallway suddenly creaks underfoot! The floor shakes
briefly and dust seems to rise from cracks near the walls. Apparently, your
unexpected presence has jarred some old mechanisms back to life!
100291: You hear a low grinding noise. The hallway underfoot suddenly shifts
and drops!
100351: You jump for a bit. The floor feels strangely unsteady.
100386: You're at the south end of a short N-S hall that seems to lead nowhere.
The hallway
100545: You hear a low grinding noise. The hallway underfoot suddenly shifts
and drops!
100607: You jump for a bit. The floor feels strangely unsteady.
100806: This is a tiny poorly lit room, that is covered in dust. An exit south
leads to a
100894: . Above, a hole has been exposed in the ceiling structure
100941: You can't go that way.
100976: You pull back before falling into what appears to be a deep pit of some
sort beyond the south exit.
101055: You hear a low grinding noise behind you.
101086: This is an exceptionally cramped attic, obviously unused for some time.
The floorboards are starting to crack.
101158: One section of the floor is particularly poor, and has a gaping hole
leading downwards into darkness.
101221: An exit heads south.
101280: You pull back at the edge of the exit. The floor, it appears, is too
far below you!
101349: You hear a low grinding noise behind you.
101471: They're nailed into the floor.
101508: The floor shakes a bit, but nothing else happens.
101550: The floor shakes under your abuse, and suddenly, a portion in the
middle sags considerably! But nothing else happens.
101639: You give the board a good couple of yanks. The board soon breaks off,
taking a small portion of the ceiling with it! After the dust settles, you
notice the rather poor remodeling job you've done to the ceiling.
101767: You'd need a good can-opener for that.
101794: The icebox is open.
101835: It is also empty.
101977: The box of cereal suddenly seems to dance with magic! Before your very
eyes, the box suddenly splits into three boxes! The magic fades, but the boxes
remain.
102075: The magic fights against the cereal box, but fails. I guess you can
only triplicate once.
102184: That doesn't quite fit.
102213: You consume the cereal. The sugar rush occurs five seconds later and
ends just as quickly.
102281: You eat the baking powder. Yuck.
102313: You eat the entire stick of butter.
102343: Your heart will no doubt thank you for that someday.
102470: You hear the door slam and lock behind you.
102516: You rummage through the cushions and a coin falls out!
102545: You find nothing of interest.
102573: The receptionist seems to be using it at the moment.
102604: The ledger reads:

" -- New signed petition for presentation and
coronation of new King delivered to Aragain Magistrate, awaiting word of event
schedule."

That's all. I guess the governor hasn't been very busy as of late.
102766: The receptionist gives you a rather menacing look.
102802: A small round desk-clock, with a set of bells on the top, and a small
pull-knob on the back. Strangely, the clock seems to be stopped. Two hands,
black and golden, are sitting at
103101: The receptionist suddenly jumps from her seat and rushes out of the
room, screaming "Lunchtime!"
103167: You see a woman rush out of the building to the southwest, and quickly
vanish.
103351: He gives you a somewhat unapproving look. "The ascetic-monk look is
out, you know. Here." He pins a rolled paper object to your clothes. "The
latest craze -- wearing magic scrolls. Beats using them nowadays, I hear. Now,
like I said, we're very busy." He goes off to the back of the store.
103535: recognizes you. "I've done all I can for you right now," he explains as
goes off to the back of the store.
103746: The knob turns -- barely. You hear a small clicking noise as well.
103819: The knob turns easily. You notice the golden hand on the front sweep to
103886: The desk is covered with a ugly waxy film. The governor looks extremely
annoyed and wipes the desk clean with a stack of papers.
103977: "Do you mind?" the governor says.
104123: The receptionist puts a hand in your way and says, "The governor is
currently busy."
104189: "Close it on your way _out_", the governor snarls.
104230: A tall lanky guy is here, holding two colorful skis. He seems to be
104278: Xnwaxing them with a scroll.
104333: "Dude, you must chill."
104368: The skier gives you the 'thumbs-up' sign. "Hey, dude."
104408: "Uh, whatever, dude."
104440: "Hey dude, can I borrow that?"
104465: "Uh, whatever, dude."
104503: "No way, dude."
104542: "I'm using it, dude."
104561: "Dude, I have no idea what you're talking about."
104608: "A rag makes an excellent ski-maintenance accessory, dude."
104665: "Something I found at the top of a run. Doesn't work too well, but hey,
I gotta wax."
104731: "My rad Grayslopes Slaloms. If you don't wax 'em every 30 seconds, they
lose their speed."
104829: The skier takes you aside. "Listen dude, between you and me, the slopes
here rot. They used to be way better. But you know, I hear there are some
_killer_ drops up north."
104934: "Dude, I have no idea what you're talking about."
104999: The skier gladly takes the rag and starts polishing immediately. He
lets the scroll fall to the ground. "Excellent man, thanks!"
105076: "No thanks, dude."
105093: At the moment, the skier is too busy waxing.
105145: "Dude, like, that scroll thing just vanished! What a cosmic
experience!" On that note, the skier opts to head for the slopes, and leaves to
the west.
105249: The skier polishes a spot on his skis.
105290: A pair of fluffy earmuffs the skier is wearing prevents him from
hearing the full impact of your sermon.
105358: splrangn
Without even looking up, the receptionist says, "The governor
is busy right now."
105426: The receptionist turns a page in the ledger.
105484: , without looking up, says "Can I help you?".
105551: in exn, without looking up, says "He's very busy right now.".
105603: The receptionist seems to be ignoring you.
105635: The receptionist, in a rather shrill voice says, "If you're gonna wait,
do it quietly," disrupting your chant.
105720: You make an unusually high-pitched noise. The receptionist, in a rather
shrill voice says, "If you're gonna wait, do it quietly."
105811: "If you want to spread germs, do it outside."
105847: "If you're gonna wait, do it quietly."
105881: "We're not holding auditions, you know."
105923: Obxn
The governor scowls as you enter. "What do you want?" he says, and
doesn't wait for a response. "Oh, I know. More complaints about the snow, I
suppose? Well look, I didn't ask for this job. Do you want it? I didn't think
so." He shoves something into your hand. "Here, buy yourself a cup of coffee,
and stop bothering me."
106222: fxnlooks up and notices you. "Don't you have anything else to do?" he
says.
106288: "Some key an important visitor forgot while visiting. Probably useless
now
106346: . You can keep it, for all I care
106379: "I think she's out to lunch," he says, with obvious annoyance.
106431: He looks at you suspiciously. "Never heard of him," he says.
106479: "I think my receptionist has it."
106511: "Please! I'm a very busy man!"
106536: "Sorry, that's not my problem. Now run along."
106576: The governor brushes you off. "Are you planning on running for office
or something?"
106635: As you make a threatening move, the governor presses some unseen switch
behind his desk. Before you know it, a hidden trapdoor opens in the floor and
you plunge to your death. A good politician is always prepared, it seems...
106779: "Sure, sure. Scram, will you?"
106817: "Yeah, sure. So what's your problem?"
106846: The governor is busy trying to look busy.
106878: Bribing a politician, eh?
106907: "Hey, return that to the receptionist!"
106932: "Please! I'm a very busy man!"
106974: "Oh sure, just go ahead and take things from my office. See if I care."
107036: Actually, the governor seems pretty glued to his seat already. In any
event, nothing seems to happen.
107104: The governor seems to nod off, but only for a second.
107143: You make an unusually high-pitched noise.
107215: The wrapper rips open with ease, and disintegrates, leaving the
contents behind.
107305: The chant, seeking wood to polish, fails.
107339: The chant, seeking a locus for triplication, fails.
107377: The chant, not designed for living creatures, fails.
107415: This violates certain unwritten laws of magic.
107451: The coin shimmers suddenly! You blink in disbelief as the coin seems to
split into three copies of itself!
107540: You notice there are now three coins where there was once but one!
107581: Suddenly, a financial nymph appears! She gives you a denunciatory look.
"Line 7234-6 of the Pierpont tax laws clearly states that repeated unauthorized
triplication of monetary items is strictly forbidden," she says, and takes the
the two newly created coins before disappearing.
107828: But, as you finish the chant, the mystic energy seems to fade, and the
copies coalesce back into one unchanged object. The chant fails.
107910: No one in the line seems to be paying you any attention.
107952: A few people doze off as you canvass the line. They are quickly
replaced by others.
108006: The sign reads:

"WELCOME TO ARAGAIN!

As today (and everyday
henceforth) has been decreed his royal lordship's birthday, we request that all
visitors respect good king Sydney Flathead's wishes and present a cake
appropriate for the occasion before entering.
108189: mtprangn"

Well, that's odd. If memory and Brother TuffBerry's Quendor
History lessons serve, the Flathead family died off more than a hundred years
ago.
108353: The guard shoves you away as you approach the gate. He points at the
sign. "No cake, no castle."
108418: It must weigh a ton, you can't seem to move it.
108480: You get the odd feeling that there's someone behind you, but when you
turn around, you see no one!
108552: From nearby, a museum curator walks up and abruptly stops your chant.
"Please don't disturb the other patrons," he says and walks off. There doesn't
seem to be anyone else around, however.
108684: You produce an extremely high-pitched noise. Suddenly, to the north, a
near-invisible wall of glass shatters into a million little shards
108794: !

From out of the shadows, a man dressed in black appears! He performs
a half-bow in your direction before deftly prying the painting off the wall!
"I'm a great appreciator of the arts, you understand," he says, as with a quick
twist of his cape, he melds into the shadows and disappears with the
painting!

As you reflect on the thief's actions, you can't help but notice
that he apparently dropped something while making his dramatic exit.
109071: Your blows have no effect, it must be quite thick.
109140: As you get close to the painting, you find yourself stopped by a
nearly-invisible glass wall!
109201: You notice a slightly loose part of the canvas in one corner, but the
painting is apparently bonded to the wall, which limits your investigation.
109289: You can't seem to move the painting at all. It's somehow bonded to the
museum wall!
109359: They both look so genuine! You can't decide!
109410: Search which one? Goodness, you can't decide!
109456: You notice a slightly loose part of the canvas in one corner. You
carefully peel back a part of the canvas from the back and reveal a hidden
scroll!
109560: A museum curator appears and graciously takes the painting. "Thank you
for recovering this priceless work." He gives you a coin. "The reward. We've
been a little short on funds lately." The curator somehow attaches the painting
to the north wall, and leaves.
109807: As you get close to the painting, you find yourself stopped by a
nearly-invisible glass wall!
109878: Strangely, it doesn't quite fit.
109916: You can't reach the vase, much less the contents of the vase.
110025: As you step onto the wood beam, it breaks with a shuddering crack!
110205: Amazingly, you float downwards like a feather, instead of falling to
your death!
110262: Unfortunately, you float slowly down to the bottom of the chamber,
which is filled with red-hot lava.
110323: You float down towards another network of floating cubes and beams.
110386: You pass between two giant floating cubes, similar to the ones you just
left. Sadly, no wood beam seems to connect these particular cubes, and you
float downwards
110532: You float to another wood beam and your feet land on it, perfectly
balanced!
110847: You step gingerly onto the wood beam...
112843: The towering fire spirit blocks your way!
112868: You close your eyes and jump straight into the hole! There is a bright
flash of light...
112950: The towering fire spirit is in your way!
112988: into the hole. There is a bright flash of light, and the object
disappears!
113054: I don't know how to do that to a giant hole.
113099: The towering fire spirit fills the hole currently!
113131: Looking through the hole, you can see a reddish haze far below.
113181: Suddenly, a flash of flame bursts through the hole in the center of the
cube! A living tower of flame attacks!
113329: ne sehn
The last blow from the fire spirit was too much for you, I'm
afraid to say. The spirit senses your weakness and engulfs you in flame.
113422: Xnsinges you with a jet of fire!
113542: As you speak the chant, the fire spirit falls back in fear! You finish
the chant, and the fire spirit dissipates into harmless smoke, banished!
113625: Crackling flame drowns out your chant.
113672: You strike the fire creature, but your attack passes harmlessly through
it! You hear a crackling noise that could pass for laughter.
113745: You attack the fire spirit, but miss!
113768: It's too busy trying to kill you.
113815: There's barely enough room to walk, much less jump.
113931: There's barely enough room to walk, much less jump.
114047: There's barely enough room to walk, much less jump.
114163: There's barely enough room to walk, much less jump.
114258: You're walking along a very narrow wood beam that runs east to west
into darkness. Above you can see a network of floating beams and cubes. Below
you can see a red glow
114376: mtprangn.

Your amulet suddenly gives off a bright flash, then fades!
114455: There's barely enough room to walk, much less jump.
114550: You're walking along a very narrow wood beam that runs north to south
into darkness. Above you can see a network of floating beams and cubes. Below
you can see a red glow.
114668: mtprangn.

Your amulet suddenly gives off a bright flash, then fades!
114747: There's barely enough room to walk, much less jump.
114865: You'll have to show me how you intend to do this, since you're standing
on the wood beam.
114918: The audience seems to be too busy waiting for something interesting to
happen.
114972: You give a marvelous sermon on patience. The audience seems glued to
their seats, which changes little.
115040: You give a rather overdone sermon on patience. A few people in the back
rows drop off to sleep.
115107: This is no time to be playing king.
115202: The wooden cabinet has been opened.
115251: It seems to be empty.
115266: It contains:
115319: The cabinet is covered in waxy build-up.
115386: , but the cabinet doors barely budge. The new-looking wood seems to be
rather tightly fitted.
115445: flon. The wax makes the doors open with ease.
115490: The cell stands open.
115533: Inside you notice:
115574: The cell is closed.
115615: Inside you notice:
115693: somen. You hear a lock mechanism in the cell door break!
115767: The guard stops you in mid-chant by blowing a rather shrill whistle.
"None of that priest mumbo-jumbo on my watch!."
115852: The guard stops you as you are about to blow the whistle. "I blow the
whistles around here."
115911: phnI'd advise against this. He's probably knows 101 ways to dismember
an opponent. Also, he's armed and encased in plate mail.
116015: "It's pretty simple. Give me a cake, and you get in. That's the rules."
116085: "Well, hand it over already."
116129: The guard looks at the pan, and hands it back. "I don't see any cake.
What are you, a wise guy or something?"
116215: The guard grabs the pan, and, to your annoyance, cuts himself a massive
slice of cake with his broadsword. The guard takes a bite
116341: and you hear a strange 'crunch'. He removes
116375: from his teeth. "What's this?" the guard says, clearly angry. "I oughta
report you to the 'Better Bakers Bureau'."
116455: , and chews for a bit. His eyes widen, and he spits the cake out. "Hey
pal, I taste
116580: , and chews for a bit. He frowns. "Sorry pal, this doesn't pass
inspection.
116704: It'd make an okay pancake, though."
116740: It's hard as a rock!"
116815: , and smacks his lips. "Finally, someone who can bake an acceptable
cake." He unlocks and opens the gate. "You can pass."
116895: oxn, and chews for a bit. He seems displeased. "I don't know where you
learned to bake, but there's definitely something missing here."
116979: The guard is amazingly good at ignoring distractions.
117025: yhn
A couple of dignitaries from Gurth push their way to the front and
present a flat object to the guard. The guard frowns. "A fish cake? I don't
think so." The dignitaries return to the line.
117151: The guard paces back and forth.
117177: A representative from Borphee steps up and presents a pile of baked
dough-bits on a plate to the guard. "Frobolli cake, eh? Well, this may be
popular where you come from, but it ain't popular here." The representative
walks off.
117327: The guard practices his menacing stares.
117361: The guard blows his whistle at some people in line.
117399: An official presents a nice morgia root pie to the guard. "A pie?" the
guard says, clearly exasperated. He points at the sign as the official leaves.
"Cakes folks, we're taking C-A-K-E-S."
117533: The guard polishes a spot on his armor.
117565: Some dignitary presents the guard with a strange green cake with the
words "EAT ME" written in frosting. The guard smiles, cuts himself a piece, and
suddenly stuffs it into the dignitary's mouth! "You boys are going to have to
do better than that," he says to the  now tiny dignitary, who stalks off.
117753: The guard hums a military dirge to himself.
117825: The Magistrate grabs the ledger and frowns as he reads it. "Fine, you
want a presentation?" He grabs a young boy who was hiding behind the throne and
shoves him forward. "Presenting his royal Highness, King Sydney Flathead, lost
heir to the Flathead monarchy!" The crowd reaction is somewhat mixed. "Well,
his head does look flat," you hear one person say.
118060: The magistrate moves with surprising speed and takes the key. "I was
looking for that!" he says.
118120: "Oh, very interesting." he says with heavy sarcasm.
118193: The magistrate takes the key. "I was looking for that!" he says.
118237: "I have no need for that!" he says with a sneer.
118269: The magistrate pays you absolutely no attention.
118341: uhn
A diplomat approaches the little boy with a document. The
Magistrate steps forward and stops him. "Sydney is much too busy to bother with
that." the Magistrate says.
118454: An impatient diplomat shouts out, "Bring out the King!" The Magistrate
smiles and says, "Did anyone make a petition for a royal presentation?" The
crowd is silent. "I didn't think so."
118618: You move quickly, but from nowhere, two royal palace guards appear and
wrestle you to the ground. "Lock this fanatic up!"
118696: You start to chant, but the magistrate has sharp ears, and recognizes
your magic! With a quick signal, two royal palace guards appear and wrestle you
to the ground. "Lock this babbler up!"
118811: Magistrate says with a sneer. The guards strip you of your possessions
and drag you down to the royal dungeons.
118940: . He's wearing a small red hat.
118986: The boy seems to miss the subtle nuances of your sermon. All that
happens is that now he seems even more nervous than before.
119070: Young Sydney Flathead only tucks his head lower and whimpers.
119114: Young Sydney Flathead only shrugs.
119157: Young Sydney Flathead doesn't respond -- he seems to find you a bit
frightening.
119211: "Hello," the young lad says, somewhat shyly.
119240: Young Sydney Flathead only stares at you.
119280: The young boy screams in terror as you move to threaten him (shame on
you!). Several guards appear out of nowhere, and club you to death for
attempting regicide.
119397: Tentatively, the boy takes the stuffed toy. You catch the glimpse of a
sad smile as he holds it tightly.
119460: Young Sydney cowers and shakes his head.
119526: Little Sydney smiles and removes the hat and hands it to you. You
notice his head is actually round, and the hat was cleverly hiding this.

"He's
no Flathead!" someone in the audience hall yells out. A distinct murmur of
discontent rises from the crowd. The Magistrate slowly backs away. "Wait! I can
explain!" the Magistrate starts, but soon runs screaming out of the hall, with
several angry diplomats hot on his heels!

"Thank you, kind sir," someone
behind you says. You turn around. Little Sydney is happily in the arms of a
kindly-looking couple. The woman continues. "Our son was kidnaped, a little
while ago. We've been waiting here, hoping to get him back. You did a very
brave thing." The man steps forward holding some small object. "A priest
fellow, such as yourself, told me a long time ago that one day, someone would
help us in our time of need, and that I should give him this." He gives you a
strange round object. "It's the least we can do." he says. The couple leaves
the hall, with the little boy laughing in their arms.
120158: Little Sydney shrinks back and holds on to his hat. He stares at you
fearfully.
120209: Little Sydney shrinks back and stares at you fearfully.
120246: Sydney shakes his head fretfully.
120301: You notice a soft yellow glow around the young boy. The glow fades.
120347: The place appears to be free of forgeries, at the moment.
120466: A small door labeled "STAIRS", of all things
120502: epn. Oddest of all is the fact that it isn't attached to anything!
120627: There's an unattached door lying on the ground here.
120799: Suddenly, out of the shadows springs a gentleman dressed in black! "How
did you get in here!" he cries. Quicker than lightning, he envelopes you in his
dark cape, which seems to fade into shadows, leaving you in...
120948: Out of the shadows, a gentleman dressed in black appears! He sees the
door to the east and seems somewhat annoyed. "Much too busy for unexpected
guests," you hear him say as he slips through the door and closes it behind
him. Moments later you hear the sound of a lock closing on the other side.
121155: Since the door doesn't currently lead anywhere, entering it seems
pointless.
121215: The door opens onto...thin air. Without a doorway to attach to, it's
not terribly useful, it appears.
121312: The door opens. There's a dark chamber on the other side, which seems
all but impossible, given that the wall previously appeared solid!
121402: You close the door, which at this moment means you turn the movable
door to a new angle. Without a doorway to attach to, it's not terribly useful,
it seems.
121528: As you drop the door, it leaps off the ground and flies towards the
eastern wall! Amazingly, it seems to attach itself to the eastern wall!
121615: You can smell scents of local cooking coming from the south.
121655: You smell rather nice floral scents coming from the east.
121690: There's a viewing telescope here, attached to the railing. One of the
lenses seems loose
121768: . Inside you see:
121815: You pry loose a lens.
121836: You push the lens back in place.
121949: exn and see a ship in the distance! Wait, perhaps not. It's gone.
122027: You can smell floral scents from the southeast.
122059: The bouquet of flowers is quite intoxicating.
122095: Don't pick the flowers.
122124: Suddenly, a few more flowers spring out of the ground!
122158: The toolshed is open.
122199: It is empty.
122331: You smell flowers to the west.
122362: The jungle seems a bit livelier now.
122526: _mtprangnYou reach out, expecting to get your hands wet, but to your
surprise, you feel a cloth-like substance. On closer examination, you realize
that the waterfall is a clever realistic-looking fake, made of cloth and wood.
Stepping around some low plants, you also notice the waterfall covers a passage
east!
122810: Moving the pot uncovers a small key hidden underneath it.
122877: The pot does appear to be sitting crooked. But you can't see whatever
is under it.
122971: You hear someone whistling nearby, but there doesn't seem to be anyone
around.
123036: You fish in the fountain for a bit and find a coin!
123118: emxq ouloqlhm. You also notice:
123178: Hoping for a little luck, I presume?
123211: You put the glasses on for a moment, and it's like looking through a
fishtank. Deciding against continuing your quest without adequate vision, you
take them off.
123306: Delbin's Pub has been a popular food and drink spot in South Anthar for
quite a while.
123370: Usually, you need to fight off barbarians to find a place to sit. At
the moment, however, the place is unusually quiet. A group of barbarians seem
paralyzed with fear near the back wall, glancing nervously at the front of the
bar.
123504: A group of barbarians are making a lot of noise nearby.
123537: The exit is to the north.
123568: The barbarians are a rather noisy bunch.
123609: Delbin calls out "Visit us again!" as you leave.
123684: The man in black makes a lightning fast move for the glass of ale, but
is countered by an equally fast move by the warrior. "Lose something, thief?"
the woman says. "No need to get violent, Morgan," the thief says.
123837: The wizard looks at his companions. "Say, did I ever show any of you my
famous disappearing glass trick?" He starts to take off his wizard's hat, but
the gentleman and ranger stop him. "Don't even try it, Frobar." the woman
warrior says.
124014: The female ranger fixates on the glass of ale. "Look you two, some of
us have better things to do, like fight wars." The wizard scowls. "Oh save it,
Morgan." he says.
124130: The barbarians are somewhat paralyzed with fear at the moment.
124168: The barbarians are far too busy telling rude jokes at the moment.
124220: The bar is covered with a waxy film. Delbin notices this and shrugs.
124295: You receive cold stares from the three individuals at the bar. "Get
your own," the Ranger says and pushes you back.
124367: You receive cold stares from the three individuals at the bar. "Get
your own," the Thief says and takes the glass from you before you can bring it
to your lips.
124467: You receive cold stares from the three individuals at the bar. "Get
your own," the Wizard says and prevents you.
124547: hits the glass and nearly topples it! A voice from the back of the room
says "Garn! He nearly ruined a perfectly good glass of ale, he did." The three
individuals at the bar turn to you with angry stares, but before you can
respond, some barbarians pummel you to death for poor bar manners.
124792: You quickly make the zemdor chant and watch the glass of ale start to
shimmer! In short time, there are three glasses filled with ale on the
bar!

Morgan the Ranger looks suspiciously at Frobar the Enchanter. "Is this
your doing, wizard?" Frobar shakes his head. "Surely not, you know I can't do
magic anymore." He glances briefly in your direction. "No matter," the thief
says, and raises a glass. "To the spirit of adventure!" The three down their
glasses quickly. Morgan smiles. "Now, that's good ale." She adjusts her
broadsword. "I'm off to the Egreth front. Want to help end a war, Frobar?"
Frobar chuckles. "Thank you, no. I've got, err, something to do at home," he
says and quickly leaves. "Well, then, what about you, thief?" Morgan asks, and
notices that the thief has already slipped away. She shrugs and leaves the bar
as well. "Good hunting!" Delbin calls after her.
125360: You begin the chant, but something about it gets the Enchanter's
attention. "If you have something to say, why don't you share it?" With a
subtle gesture, the Enchanter dispels the chant.
125479: You can hear the roars of a good crowd from inside the stadium. Must be
playoff season.
125545: You walk right into the stadium. The ticket-takers must be on strike or
something.
125601: As you head towards the entrance, a mob of crazed fans rushes out of
the stadium ("Isn't that Babe Flathead?" you hear someone scream) and tramples
you to death.
125736: Oddly, the statue seems to sit slightly tilted.
125791: You give the statue a shove, and it wobbles and falls, breaking into
useless dust! A passing sportsfan notices your act of vandalism, and says to a
friend, "Look at that. The guy wins one bout of Golem wrestling, and he thinks
he's better than Babe Flathead."
125953: The statue seems to be firmly fixed in place.
125986: You hear voices behind you, and suddenly, a small crowd of people pass
by, pushing a statue.

"Right there," someone shouts, and a few people position
the statue into the square hole.
126122: It fits neatly in place.
126195: "That's perfect," you hear a voice say, and the crowd murmurs in
agreement. Why, it's Babe Flathead himself! He saunters up towards the statue,
which is indeed a good likeness, and starts handing out cigars. "We'll get to
autographs later," he says while lighting your cigar as you try to protest.
Seconds later, the cigar explodes! You see sparkling stars, which seem to
change to purple flashes. You blink.
126467: The crowd is deafening.
126493: The burly man jumps out of his seat as you try to pass. "Hey buddy, I'm
saving those seats." He points to an entire row of seats below you. "I've been
waiting all season, and I don't want an obstructed view, so look for somewhere
else to sit." He sits back in his seat.
126677: The burly man jumps out of his seat as you try to pass. "Hey buddy, I'm
saving those seats." He points to an entire row of seats below you. "I've been
waiting all season, and I don't want an obstructed view, so look for somewhere
else to sit." He sits back in his seat.
126859: The crowd is deafening.
126892: A couple front row fans are getting a bit boisterous. Several of them
throw garbage and paper debris towards the field. You notice something flutter
down by your feet.
127003: The crowd is deafening.
127027: You can hear the crowd outside.
127055: You head for the showers, but the coach springs out and blocks your
way. "Come on kid, keep your head in the game."
127144: Someone in the crowd yells out, "Get him a body bag!" We assume he was
referring to the golem, not you.
127216: The crowd does 'the wave'.
127242: The crowd waves some strange colorful objects. Rather distracting.
127290: Someone in the crowd screams "Flathead that golem!"
127335: The crowd is deafening.
127363: The Christmas Tree Monster belts out a few bars of 'I'm dreaming of a
Black Cavern' arranged by Bing Frozby.
127445: The Christmas Tree Monster sings a few measures from Berknip's own
rendition of 'Silent Night', a rather morbid version.
127535: The Christmas Tree Monster hums a few notes from 'Dornbeasts Roasting
on an Open Pyre'.
127603: The Christmas Tree Monster whistles a part of 'Frosty the Snow Wight'.
127659: The Christmas Tree Monster sways in time to 'Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow'.
127725: The Christmas Tree Monster treats you to an abridged version of
Handel's 'Messiah'.
127784: The Christmas Tree Monster hums to itself.
127830: You'll need a gardening implement to do that.
127864: The gardener said he'd make you dig for slugs, and that doesn't sound
too exciting, so let's leave the tree alone.
127936: You being to clip a few of the lower branches of the Christmas Tree
Monster, who bellows in pain!

Out of nowhere, a short old man appears, wearing
full gardener regalia. He drags your hand away from the tree.

"What are ya
trying to do there, kill the thing?" he says.
128120: He pulls out a pair of glasses and puts it on. "Say, I don't know you,"
he says. "If you want to practice introductory horticulture, do it in someone
else's garden!" He grabs the clippers from your hands and stalks off.
128304: searching his pockets. "Confound it, lost my glasses again."
128359: He squints again, and says, "Well, whoever you are, the gardens are for
looking at, not practicing landscape design!" He grabs the clippers out of your
hands and stalks off.
128477: He looks at you again, and notices your cap. "You must be one of the
new boys. Here, look, I'm not going to show you twice." He takes the clippers
and delicately clips away several lower branches, all the while singing "It's
beginning to look a lot like Christmas". He finishes trimming the tree, leaving
a nice opening exposing the shrub next to it, and stops singing. "I'm starting
to hate that tune," he says under his breath. He hands the clippers back to you
and says, "Now if I catch you doing this wrong again, I'm going to make you dig
for slugs, understand?" He disappears as quickly as he appeared.
128846: You start chanting, but the tree starts singing "Plover the river and
frotz the woods" and you can't help joining in, ruining your chant.
128931: You song is drowned out by a boisterous chorus by the tree.
128980: The tree abruptly stops singing, and seems a trifle flustered for some
reason. Moments later, it resumes its chorus.
129052: The tree just keeps on singing.
129147: The small shrub looks rather poorly tended. Just a few green leaves
distinguish it from the surrounding soil.
129213: The small shrub looks quite healthy. A cluster of green leaves and
branches make a nice plant. It's still smaller than the tree, though.
129398: The shrub seems to shake suddenly! A new leaf grows, searchs for the
sunlight, and finds it! Another leaf follows, and soon the shrub is sprouting
new branches. In the sunlight, flowers appear, and a cycle of missed-out
seasons is made-up for in minutes! The shrub is now quite a thriving plant,
covered with tiny red fruit.
129598: The shrub shakes a bit, but the plant remains the same. For a Dornberry
bush, it's already probably the healthiest one you've ever seen.
129696: I don't think the shrub can support that.
129726: The plaque reads:
129909: You begin your sermon. The man starts to tell you to knock it off, but
starts to listen with awe. As you finish, the man tries to get up to shake your
hand, but realizes he is stuck fast. "They gotta start cleaning these seats,"
he says.
130051: You begin a description of the 1700 different kinds of holy water, but
the man seems so enthralled with the game below, he just isn't paying
attention.
130158: "You were amazing pal. Ever think of going pro?"
130206: "It's the three-golem special. One contestant versus three golems, one
after the other. Great stuff."
130276: "Give it a rest pal, I'm watching the game."
130310: An old fellow with bushy eyebrows and a gruff demeanor. He's dressed
like a sports coach
130374: . You also notice he's holding some sort of trophy.
130429: rangm
The coach looks up and notices you. "Oh, you must be the
replacement," he says. He drags you over to the field entrance. "Well, I hoped
you're warmed up, cuz you're up." He shoves you north. "Remember, these guys
are tough, so give 'em your best stuff."
130599: The coach looks up and notices you. "Where have you been? The ref was
about to default it to the golems!" He shoves you north. "Now get in there and
make me proud."
130735: The coach gives you a slap on the back that knocks the wind out of you.
"You did it! I didn't think you had it in you!" He hands you a small bag.
"Here's the winnings. I went ahead and took out my cut, of course."
130871: "You want a couple rounds with the old man too? Well, I'm ready." For
an old coach, he still looks like he's in pretty good shape. You decide against
violent action.
130983: The coach merely nods.
131010: "It's a beauty all right."
131038: "It's all there, count it if you want."
131076: The coach looks momentarily reflective. "Life is all about getting into
the game," he says. "Remember that, it's not about winning or losing, but
giving it your best shot."
131221: "A bowlful of that each morning is bound to make a champion out of
you."
131298: The coach looks lovingly at the trophy, and then at you. "Fair enough
kid, you earned it." he says, and gives it to you. "I've seen a lot of
golem-wrestlers in my time, but I gotta say, you're the best golem-wrestler
I've ever seen." He leaves the locker room to greet his fans.
131472: At the moment, it looks like the coach is too busy writing a Hall of
Fame acceptance speech to pay you much attention.
131551: "What's that you're saying? Speak up, I'm your coach, I'm hear to
listen."
131610: mtprangn
The ref blows his whistle and says "Round 1". The golem, not
needing any encouragement, jumps into the fray.
131695: Your opponent is the golem, not the referee.
131736: "Sorry, no timeouts!" the ref says.
131768: "It looked good to me."
131802: "You're in round 1."
131827: "You're in round 2."
131852: "You're in round 3, the final round."
131878: The ref makes some completely bewildering hand signal, that could be an
insult, for all you know about wrestling. In any event, nothing happens.
131979: You start to relate the advantages of Bingo over Double Fanucci to the
ref, and sooner that you can say "Zounds", the ref is fast asleep!
Unfortunately, the golem takes advantage of this opportunity and breathes
poison gas at you! You reflect on this display of poor sportsmanship as you
slowly lose consciousness.
132269: The golem staggers you with a punch that sends you reeling!
132394: The wood golem makes a swipe for you, and misses.
132444: The wood golem is suddenly covered with a waxy buildup! Greatly
embarrassed, he turns to call foul, and slips! With a great thud, the golem
hits the turf, and knocks himself out cold!

The ref says "Knockout!". The
crowd cheers in approval.

Several dwarves appear and cart the wood golem off.
Unfortunately, a stone golem soon walks into view!

The coach yells from the
doorway "You're doing great kid, just hang in there."

The ref says "Round 2!"
132787: With a thundering blow, you smash the golem into kindling!

The ref
says "Knockout!". The crowd cheers in approval.

Several dwarves appear and
cart the wood golem off. Unfortunately, a stone golem soon walks into
view!

The coach yells from the doorway "You're doing great kid, just hang in
there."

The ref says "Round 2!"
133043: . It didn't seem to slow him down, though.
133078: You swing, but miss.
133191: The golem hits you with a punch that sends you reeling!
133227: The golem jabs with his left, and misses!
133254: The golem tries to close, and misses.
133302: The golem is suddenly replaced with a pile of steaming linguini
alfredo!

The ref yells "Takeout!" The crowd goes wild! Several dwarves appear
and serve the pasta to the crowd on platters. Unfortunately, an iron golem soon
walks into view! 

The coach yells out from the safety of the locker room "Okay
kid, drop this golem, and we can celebrate."

The ref yells "Round 3!"
133595: With a thundering blow, you smash the golem into gravel!

The ref says
"Knockout!". The crowd cheers in approval.

Several dwarves appear and cart the
stone golem off. Unfortunately, an iron golem soon walks into view!

The coach
yells out from the safety of the locker room "Okay kid, drop this golem, and we
can celebrate."

The ref yells "Round 3!"
133825: Solid blow! Stone chips fly.
133859: . It didn't seem to slow him down, though.
133894: You swing, but miss.
133931: ne sehn
The iron golem jumps forward and flattens you, which feels
similar to getting mashed by a giant block of iron. Oww.
134013: The golem staggers you with a punch that sends you reeling! That felt
quite painful.
134067: The golem tries to flatten you, and you evade just in time!
134104: The golem tries to step on you, and you dodge.
134172: The golem suddenly develops many unsightly patches of rust. Mortified,
the golem calls for his oil trainer, but to no avail! It soon falls apart into
several rusty metal pieces!

The ref calls out "The winner!" and holds your
hand aloft. The crowd is on its feet! They'd probably be chanting your name, if
they knew it.

Several dwarves appear and drag off the rusty metal plates. The
ref explains that the prize money and a championship trophy will be awarded in
the locker room, and exits.
134545: With a thundering blow, you smash the golem into ball-bearings.

The
ref calls out "The winner!" and holds your hand aloft. The crowd is on its
feet! They'd probably be chanting your name, if they knew it.

Several dwarves
appear and collect the ball-bearings. The ref explains that the trophy will be
awarded in the locker room, and exits.
134757: Solid blow! You make a small dent.
134793: . It didn't seem to slow him down, though.
134828: You swing, but miss.
134853: There's a warrior-maiden sitting at the bar, her eyes riveted to the
glass of ale.
134905: Morgan the Ranger is here.
134950: The Ranger sees you approach and recognizes you. "Well met again,
Priest. I have need of your assistance to end the kobold border war that has
been going on far too long." She pauses. "To the west and east are two of my
lieutenants and their soldiers, cut off from the rest of us by previous kobold
raids. I have the power to end this war and call a truce, but to do so, I need
to inform both of my lieutenants to stop fighting via windcat message
carriers." She points to the two windcats in the wicker cage and the pile of
colored flags. "The 'red' flags indicate 'attack', the 'blue', truce. When my
lieutenants receive the instructions, they will verify my commands by sending
additional messengers with 'attack' or 'truce' instructions to each other.
Based on the two received messages, each lieutenant will act accordingly." She
slaps you on the back, jolting you to attention. "Herein lies my problem,
Priest. I know for a fact, that one of my lieutenants is a traitor, who will
disobey my orders. Any instruction I send to the traitor, the opposite will be
sent by the traitor to my remaining good lieutenant. The traitor will also take
the two orders he receives and do the opposite, if there is a majority, or
attack outright, if there are messages of 'truce' and 'attack'. Thankfully, my
good lieutenant will faithfully copy my instructions to the other lieutenant,
and will follow orders received, if there is a majority, or follow a 'truce' if
there are mixed messages. My greatest problem, Priest, is that I do not know
which lieutenant is the traitor! If you can bring peace once and for all to
Southern Egreth, many will remember your good deeds."
136026: She's well-armed and probably dangerous.
136064: A gracious gesture, perhaps, but she isn't interested.
136106: She nearly splits your skull with the flat of a huge broadsword before
you even get close. "For a man of the cloth, you've got a lot of nerve," she
says.
136239: "Right, the windcats. The speckled cat will find the lieutenant to the
east. The spotted cat will find the lieutenant to the west.
136483: i,." The wizard looks rather insulted. "Oh hush up, Morgan." the wizard
says.
136595: this fellow over here," she says and gives the gentleman a whack on the
back that nearly knocks his teeth out. "But I hear he's something of a thief."
"Nothing of the sort!" the gentleman protests.
136715: ixnthat thief fellow. I've been told he has a hideout somewhere, nearly
impossible to find."
136783: "The war wages on, priest, even though the battle was lost long ago,
and there were no winners, kobold or man."
136863: Morgan becomes momentarily thoughtful. "Some of the best dragon-hunting
I ever did was up in Frostham long ago. Those white frost dragons are quite a
vicious lot. Best not to wake a sleeping white dragon unless you have a weapon
handy and know how to use it!"
137033: "Sorry, I'm not sure about that."
137061: Morgan the Ranger appears to be thinking important thoughts at the
moment.
137115: "What's that you're mumbling there priest?"
137153: There's an old wizard sitting at the bar, his eyes riveted to the glass
of ale.
137233: You make a threatening move. The wizard practically yawns! "Just what
the world needs, another violent Priest." You stop, somewhat embarrassed.
137338: The wizard nods. "Hello, hello, and all that rubbish."
137386: The wizard is somewhat occupied at the moment.
137427: Frobar scowls. "Magic? We've seen the last of magic, let me tell you.
Does anyone remember what it did for us? Does anyone mention the Enchanters
that saved Quendor from certain ruin many a time? Of course not. A bunch of
ingrates
137581: . I just hope they're teaching the kids at Tech what magic was all
about, before we got all this 'new science' stuff everyone's blabbering about."
137695: Frobar sighs. "Golems used to be useful, you know. But now, without
magic to control them, they go off and get into all sorts of mischief."
137793: "Some fellow I've had some dealings with in the past. Not a bad chap,
but he does like to supplement his income, if you know what I mean. Far too
risky a profession for my taste."
137915: "Morgan Grueslayer, top military Ranger in her graduating class, I
hear. If she asks you to join her on one of her campaigns, just walk away. All
that fighting -- too stressful if you ask me."
138043: "Don't even get me started."
138079: The wizard is somewhat occupied at the moment.
138121: Frobar snatches the magazine out of your hands. "What are you doing
with my mail?" he says, irritated.
138187: "A magic scroll, eh? Doesn't do me a lot of good these days."
138258: for a moment. "Something more than meets the eye here. Couldn't tell
you what, though."
138322: "So, you're a carpenter too?" Frobar says, somewhat sarcasticly.
138384: "Hmm. Not very interesting."
138439: The wizard pushes your offering aside. "I'm somewhat busy at the
moment," he says, his eyes glued to the glass of ale.
138523: Frobar grabs the magazine. "What are you doing with my mail?" he says,
irritated.
138572: "No, thank you."
138585: "I'm rather busy at the moment."
138622: Frobar seems annoyed. "Get out of my bed!" he says, and drags you to
your feet.
138701: Frobar tends to the plant.
138777: Frobar pulls a book off the shelves, glances through it, and puts it
back.
138888: Frobar mutters to himself, "They didn't even invite me to the Last
Enchanter's Guild Meeting."
138960: Frobar mutters to himself, "Good old dependable Frobar. Bah!"
139013: ochc o,
Frobar leafs through a magazine he holds. "What happened to
Barsap? Hah! Did they ask me? No, of course not."
139097: Frobar checks his pockets. "What did I do with this month's 'Enchanter
Monthly'?" he muses outloud.
139349: Frobar glances over the term paper and his eyes widen. "Wilbur -- why,
that's my great nephew!" He takes the paper and reads. "So true, so true," he
mumbles and smiles. "A fine boy, perhaps he'll become a great man someday, if
he stops skipping class. He reminds me of my days at Tech -- all filled with
dreams and hopes." He pauses, and searches his pockets. "I even perfected a
spell, did you know? Good old loyal, boring Frobar perfected a spell, and, if
it hadn't been for that Snaboz show-off who had to go and perfect the izyuk
spell, I might have even tried to publish mine." He finds a scroll amongst his
robes and hands it to you. "You don't believe me? Here, see for yourself."
139801: There's a gentleman dressed in black sitting at the bar, his eyes
riveted to the glass of ale.
139869: You make a threatening move, but the thief seems to move twice as fast!
You find yourself looking at the sharp end of a stiletto. "I'm too much of a
gentleman to harm a Priest," the thief says, "so don't force me to make an
exception."
140024: The gentleman gives a sharp nod in your direction.
140068: The thief gives you a knowing nod. "The Aragain magistrate? A honorless
cur, if I ever saw one."
140138: The thief shrugs. "I hear there's a nice new painting on exhibit at the
royal museum. You might want to check it out."
140218: The thief shrugs. "Do I look like a locksmith?"
140272: Confused, the thief pockets your offering. "Quite generous of you,
sir." he says.
140324: The gentleman glances at you with dark suspicious eyes.
140367: You speak the chant perfectly, but nothing seems to happen! The
gentleman smiles and pats his dark cloak, which seems to glow briefly with
mystic energy, then fade!
140471: You speak the chant perfectly, but nothing seems to happen! The
gentleman smiles and pats his dark cloak, which seems to glow briefly with
mystic energy, then fade!
140579: Delbin cleans some glasses behind the bar.
140622: "You're welcome to that unsightly thing, sir. Been trying to get rid of
it for sometime."
140682: Delbin give you a curious look, but says nothing.
140726: Leave good old Delbin alone.
140761: "Welcome to Delbin's, good sir."
140799: Delbin refuses your offering. "Keep your change, sir. If you're looking
for a good tip, I can tell you what I hear."
140897: Delbin takes the rag and cleans a spot on the bar, leaving it in a
familiar place.
140948: Delbin politely refuses.
140979: "There's a good story behind that ugly thing. Maybe if you keep
reminding me, I'll remember it."
141095: "Quite a situation we've got sir. Those three at the front of the bar
all ordered a glass of Special Borphee Ale. Well, with the shutdown of the
Brewers Guild in Borphee since the Great Change, I can't keep that particular
beverage in stock, but I've got that one left there. Seems none of them's
leaving until they decide who gets the ale -- and let me tell you, those three
are folks who don't like to be disappointed!"
141358: Delbin smiles. "All out of ale sir. But I suppose ye already knew
that?"
141418: Delbin shrugs. "Sounds vaguely familiar sir, maybe I heard a rumor
about it once. Can't really say, though."
141500: "There's a good story behind that ugly thing. Maybe if you keep
reminding me, I'll remember it."
141568: "Not much more than a rag, sir."
141600: "I think that's the name of some old Antharian Sea Goddess. Like a
patron saint to sailors, in the old days."
141680: "Morgan Grueslayer's a skilled ranger."
141720: "Frobar's probably one of the last enchanters around. He's a regular
here."
141778: "Don't really know that fellow's name. He tips well, though."
141836: Delbin scratches his ear and says, "Yes, now, what did I hear..."
141892: "People tell me this new Flathead king is a fake, plain and simple.
Hasn't stopped people from trying to get on his good side, though. Now, I
haven't seen the fellow myself, but if you ask me, somebody somewhere is up to
no good."
142042: "They say the kobold war up north is gonna end real soon. I'll believe
that when it happens."
142133: You see that headdress over there? Well, this explorer fellow left it
here, along with quite a story. He
142218: claimed he found some lost ancient city in the Miznia jungles. Said he
made a map to the place, but lost it when bargaining for his life with some
jungle natives. I just nodded and let the poor man talk."
142340: "This crazy-looking old fellow stops in the other day. Said that he was
a professor, at GUE Tech, but that he was giving that all up! Something about
his research going bad, on something he called 'an ethereal gate'. What all of
that means, I can't say."
142502: "Say, you sorta remind me of this other Priest fellow who stopped by
here a long long time ago. Delbin never forgets, you know? This fellow, who
didn't give a name, told me he was on an important quest for something called
-- now what was it -- 'The Rod of the Ancients', or something like that. That
mean anything to you?"
142710: "An artist friend of mine tells me that this new Leonardo Flathead
painting they've recently discovered on display at the Royal Museum has a
special secret. They say that Leonardo painted over something else under the
canvas, but no one's saying what. They're keeping a watchful eye on it too,
just in case curiosity gets the better of some folk. In fact, I hear they've
already had a few people trying to steal the thing
143018: Delbin shrugs. "Guess I'm getting old, nothing comes to mind at the
moment. Maybe if you give me a moment, I'll think of something."
143116: You relate a fine sermon to Delbin about spirits -- both the liquid
kind and the not-so-liquid kind. Were Delbin sitting rather than standing
behind the bar, he might even be glued to his seat by now. "A fine speech
there, reverend."
143266: You relate a dull sermon to Delbin about the various types of wood
casks used in brewing Mithicus beer. Delbin, being a bartender, is a good
listener, and manages to stay awake.
143383: Your chant goes unanswered. It's not intended for living creatures.
143429: Your chant goes unanswered. It's intended for boats apparently.
143496: Your chant goes unanswered. You need a genuine natural storm, I
suppose.
143556: The chant backfires, and your feet feel numb!
143599: You speak the chant in clear tones. Initially, you feel no different.
And then, strangely, your back feels better than it has in years, and your step
seems lighter!
143741: You feet feel heavy again.
144002: A buzzer sounds, and some mysterious force prevents you from leaving!
144054: A strange force pushes your hand away.
144082: An vault labeled "INTEREST PAID" is open in the wall
144182: An vault labeled "OVERHEAD" is open in the wall
144274: An vault labeled "BASIS" is open in the wall
144362: An vault labeled "LOANS" is open in the wall
144455: The farmhouse is run-down enough already without you stomping around in
it.
144502: A coastline sand bar curves west a short distance here, ending in a
shoal of large rocks. Nearby, someone has dug some shallow holes in the sand,
probably farming for live Rotund Oysters, a popular Eastland delicacy.
144640: Unfortunately, the oyster beds are too far inland, and they appear to
be empty. A bit to the west you can see a small shoreline cave in the rocks.
144726: The oyster beds are filled with water (similar to a good portion of the
shoal) and look well stocked!
144795: Seawater is hardly a rare commodity these days.
144890: rangmdifficult to get there from here. Suddenly, a rock slips from
underfoot! You fall...
144981: Any remainder of the sand bar west is now submerged by a high tide or
rise in the sea.
145114: You find a couple immature oysters, and throw them back.
145159: Someone is obviously trying to use these holes for oyster farming. Best
to leave them as you found them.
145226: You seem to be in some underground cave.
145258: There are no visible exits. You feel rather claustrophobic. You also
hear some unexpected noises.
145320: There is a small dark tunnel leading south. You hear the sounds of
rushing water from somewhere nearby.
145393: You can't go that way.
145417: The dark tunnel becomes blocked after a short distance by a great tidal
swell! The sea has risen above the entrance!
145495: You crawl through the dark tunnel, which seems to snake back and forth.
After what seems like an eternity, you see daylight, and stumble forward. You
find yourself on the sand bar again! Looking back, you can't locate the tunnel
you just left at all!
145655: You hear the sounds of the sea all around you.
145711: A nice beach with lots of tall grasses hides behind a short dune here.
The Great Sea stretches out to the south.
145779: A deep marsh hides behind a short dune here. The Great Sea is making
some inroads here, apparently. That volcano in the water to the south may have
had something to do with it.
145880: From here, you can go north, west or east. You can just glimpse some
sort of tower-like structure far across the bay in the east.
145965: You'll have to get out of the sailboat first.
146009: You'll have to get out of the sailboat first.
146053: You'll have to get out of the sailboat first.
146103: The tides here make swimming unadvisable.
146139: The tides here make swimming unadvisable.
146175: A nice little sailboat that looks pretty sea-worthy. The word "MINIRVA"
is painted on one side.
146240: A badly damaged sailboat. Several places bear deep cracks, as though
the boat had been tossed in a violent storm.
146324: In it's current condition, this boat is lucky to be floating.
146493: That's too cumbersome to carry.
146518: You are sailing on Fublio Bay. A shoreline lies to the north. You could
probably sail out of the bay to the south, but I'd advise against it, the winds
aren't very strong. To the northeast you can see
146676: mxna partially submerged lighthouse tower. Also, to the southeast is a
small volcanic island where you could probably land.
146759: The winds blow the wrong way, and you end up back here.
146807: You can't go that way.
146840: A sudden gust of wind sends your small craft skimming out of control!
146900: The water's pretty deep here. I'd stay in the boat.
146939: Seawater is hardly a rare commodity these days.
147101: There appears to be a steady stream of bubbles coming from somewhere
deep in the water near you! Also, you see something dark rising from the depths
below you!
147205: You notice a few small bubbles rise to the surface of the sea.
147262: You're lost at sea. The winds are completely dead. They managed to take
you quite a ways out before they died, however, and it's currently hard to tell
which way land was from here
147370: mlpyou ipn. Oddly, there's a volcano far out to the south, still
smoldering from a recent eruption.
147452: The water's pretty deep here. I'd stay in the boat.
147491: Seawater is hardly a rare commodity these days.
147653: There appears to be a steady stream of bubbles coming from somewhere
deep in the water near you.
147794: in a clearing on a grassland peninsula. A trail leads northwest from
here, and another leads west. Off to the southeast, there's an entrance into
what looks like an old abandoned lighthouse, just at the tip of the peninsula.
147922: mlpyou yxnon the southeast tip of a grassland peninsula. A trail leads
northwest from here, and another leads west. Off to the southeast, you can see
the top of what looks like a lighthouse, partially submerged in the Great Sea.
148059: Looks like you'd need a boat to get out to that lighthouse now.
148106: You're inside an ancient lighthouse. The place must have been deserted
quite a long time ago, and is now a mess of broken stone, cobwebs and seabird
droppings. The rest of the peninsula is back northwest. You can see a hole
above where a stairway probably entered an upper floor of the place, but the
stairway itself crumbled into dust long ago
148310: mlpround kkedcu    mtprangn.

Your amulet suddenly gives off a bright
purple flash, then returns to normal!
148442: The toy volcano drops into the water and sinks like a stone.
148498: The umbrella seems to float on the water like a cloth dome for a short
bit, but eventually sinks into the water.
148645: It's just salty sea water.
148693: There's something down there all right!
148728: You glimpse a large grouper swimming under the water, and watch it swim
away.
148780: The water seems choppy and deep. You notice nothing beneath the waves
at the moment.
148891: jyouj 7e ak ne sehn
There's a massive explosion from the south! You
turn and rub your eyes in disbelief. There's a volcano rising out of the sea!
Unfortunately, there's also a large tidalwave headed your way (caused by
volcanic eruption at sea, no doubt) which engulfs you as you try to scramble
for higher ground! You struggle valiantly, but drown in deep water.
149117: You hear a massive explosion from the south! It sounded pretty far off,
but whatever it was, it was loud.
149291: ne sehn
You hear a large explosion off to the north! A massive tidal
swell rushes by and tosses your small craft violently, knocking you into the
water. As you watch the waves carry the boat away, a giant grouper swims up and
swallows you.
149550: You're on the outside of what looks like the upper part of a
lighthouse, sticking straight out of the sea. The lighthouse is broken in many
places, and several areas provide ledge-space to stand on. In fact, you could
probably climb into the lighthouse through one of many large cracks in the
walls to the east. The rest of Fublio bay is back southwest
149765: mtprangn.

Your amulet suddenly gives off a bright purple flash, then
returns to normal!
149833: You'll need to get out of the boat first.
149873: The water looks pretty choppy. I'd suggest you use a sea-going vessel
of some sort.
149941: The water looks pretty choppy. I'd suggest you use a sea-going vessel
of some sort.
150009: You'll need to get out of the boat first.
150047: Near a still-active volcano? Not wise.
150083: Near a still-active volcano? Not wise.
150119: You find that anything left to enter in the wreck has pretty much
decayed away.
150178: You perform a nice ritual to the Sea Gods, and before your very eyes,
the ship attempts to repair itself! But there's too much damage, and not even
the aid of the Sea Gods can fix this craft. The chant fails.
150332: Something about the old boat rings a familiar tune. You check near
something that might have once been a mast, and uncover a familiar green rod!
150429: The water spirit buffets you with water and prevents you from leaving.
150477: You drop through the hole, and land in cold dark water! Trapped in an
enclosed pool of seawater, with the hole too far above you, you drown shortly
afterwards.
150579: You hear some sloshing noises from below the floor.
150624: "'Forget zucchini,' they told me, 'Go into oyster farming. You'll make
a fortune.' Ha!"
150700: The farmer sees you approach and rushes to greet you. "I saw what you
did, sir, yes indeed. A mighty crazy thing to do, calling a volcano outa the
water like that. But you did it! And my oyster beds thank you kindly! I'd like
to repay the favor, but I'm only a poor farmer." He pauses, then searches his
pockets. "Here," he says, putting something in your hand. "Found it digging in
the sand. Don't know what it is, but I'll bet you can use it." He smiles and
disappears into the farmhouse.
151017: Something about attacking a down-on-his-luck farmer just doesn't seem
right, so you stop.
151088: The farmer nods in your direction. "How do, stranger?"
151140: "Did a foolish thing, sir, tried my luck with oyster farming this year.
The place is too far from the sea, and I can't get any oysters in my beds,
'cause there's no water to grow 'em in."
151266: "Hey, I seen something like that once."
151297: The farmer smiles, but shakes his head.
151324: The farmer is preoccupied with something as he squints into the sun.
151378: "I'm just a simple farmer, sir. I'm afraid you're losing me with your
fancy words."
151449: Suddenly, water seeps in from the west, and forms into a large
vaguely-humanoid shape before your very eyes!
151659: ne sehn
The last blow from the water spirit was too much for you, I'm
afraid to say. You sink to the ground, to weak to defend yourself, as the
spirit slowly oozes towards you for the final blow...
151982: As you speak the chant, the water spirit falls back in fear! You finish
the chant, and the water spirit makes one last attempt to smother you, but
dissipates with a splash!
152079: The creature makes a banshee-howl as you chant.
152239: It's too busy trying to kill you.
152278: The hermit stares at you and screams. "Demon, trickster -- you'll not
fool me again!"
152342: The hermit smiles at you. "Come to pay your respects to an old man,
Humboz? I know it's you."
152406: ihn
The hermit shrinks into a corner and weeps. "No more, no more. I
can help you no more."
152468: The hermit hums a little tune.
152490: ixn
The hermit talks to someone or thing unseen. "Closer, closer, nary
a sound betray..."
152556: The hermit grabs your shoulder. "I am hampered," he pleads with you,
"by the lack of an algebraic solution! That was where I went wrong!"
152650: The hermit babbles something about a shining tower on a hill.
152692: The hermit pauses. "Listen, do you hear them? The voices --
everywhere!"
152743: The hermit giggles for no reason.
152782: "We meet again, do we not?"
152821: The hermit laughs. "You want to leave already? Very well, you'll find
the exit where you came in."
152889: The hermit chuckles. "Forgotten where you came in? It hasn't gone
anywhere.
153032: "My friends of the deep, they sacrifice themselves for me, as I will
some day for them."
153085: "Many are the secrets you keep."
153170: . "Good, yes. I have something for you -- something you will treasure
as I have." He gives you a piece of parchment.
153246: "No, no, I already have many of those."
153284: The hermit cowers in one corner of the cave, screaming. You stop, and
reconsider.
153338: Tears run down the hermit's cheek.
153373: The hermit visibly salivates.
153392: The hermit gibbers maniacally.
153419: The hermit joins in with your chanting, and twists the meaning of the
words! You quickly stop.
153471: ne sehn
The hermit seems to recognize you through his madness! "You
have returned! The Big Man! Biggest of them all! Returned to deliver me from my
prison. I had never forsaken you!"

"Wait," you protest, "stop this
madness!"

But the crazed hermit continues. He prostrates in front of you and
babbles incoherently. "I put all my faith in you -- I have to leave here,
before I go insane! The others, they abandoned hope. But not me. No! You have
always had our best interests in mind."

He begins an eerie, frenetic song that
jars your very soul. You watch the water level start to rise near the southern
entrance, and wait for the end.
153870: Your chant goes unanswered. I guess you need pure iron.
153920: A number of people rudely brush past you and accidentally knock you
down. A kindly old lady helps you to your feet. "I think you dropped that," she
says, pointing to a paper object nearby that doesn't seem familiar. She walks
off, and is soon lost in the crowd.
154088: As you enter the small chamber, metal doors suddenly spring forward and
close behind you!
154142: The sign reads:

"ELEVATOR UNDER CONSTRUCTION
PLEASE USE STAIRS.
154279: Suddenly, the doors spring open! You dive out.
154327: Bridge-jumping carries a stiff fine around here.
154469: The group of soldiers won't let you pass.
154507: Forget it.
154516: The soldiers are a little too weary to pay you any direct attention at
the moment.
154571: You can't seem to pry open the cage door by hand.
154615: A soldier slaps your hand away. "That windcat messenger box belongs to
our Captain, Morgan Grueslayer, so don't mess with it!"
154708: You pull the lever and watch the cage door momentarily open, then shut.
154797: Morgan stops you and points at the windcats. "An instruction must be
sent with both of the cats, using the signal flags!"
154868: Morgan stops your hand, just as you are about to pull the lever. She
looks at the cats. "Are you quite sure, Priest?"

Now, that seems like a
reasonable question. So, are you?
154988: You pause, to reconsider.
155020: You nod and yank the lever. The cage door latch is loosened enough for
both windcats to break free! The spotted windcat tears off to the west, and the
speckled cat zips off to the east!

There is a somewhat stressful pause.
155188: Simultaneously, from the east and west, a three horn signal sounds!
Morgan smiles triumphantly. "A truce has been declared! The war has ended!" The
army soldiers yell a round of "Three cheers!" before heading off. Morgan shakes
your hand with almost enough force to break it. "Well done indeed, Priest. Your
wisdom only compliments your tranquil nature." She walks off, seeking the next
challenge.
155444: round:nSuddenly, from somewhere, a single horn note sounds! The sounds
of a fight to the north are soon heard. Morgan gives you a sad, tired look.
"Perhaps it was meant to be," she says, as she and the army quickly march north
to join their comrades.
155603: The windcat hisses and struggles until you desist.
155648: I don't think the windcat would appreciate that.
155695: I don't think the windcat would appreciate that.
155733: The windcat purrs.
155755: The windcat hisses and struggles until you desist.
155800: I don't think the windcat would appreciate that.
155847: I don't think the windcat would appreciate that.
155885: The windcat purrs.
155909: You're not getting past that bloody battle (intact).
155957: You're not getting past that bloody battle (intact).
156006: You give a yell and plunge into the battle, and get skewered by a
kobold arrow moments later.
156065: At the moment, everyone seems rather occupied.
156103: A light wind howls through this tunnel.
156135: The air smells a bit musty and stale.
156162: You are in a large man-made underground chamber, with a perfectly domed
high ceiling. Smooth stone archways lead to rooms to the north, south, east and
west. Stone cut steps lead down. In the very center of the ceiling you notice a
strange circular depression in the stone
156322: dcu    mtprangn.

Your amulet suddenly gives off a flash of purple
light, then fades!
156406: ceeghcdn   a,
Lord Duncanthrax and some of his soldiers are
here.

Duncanthrax looks up and sees you. "Who is that?" he asks. "Looks like a
priest," a soldier says. "Wonderful. First, the black paint, and now, a priest
breaks into my trophy room." He sighs. "Will no one rid me of this meddlesome
priest?" One of the soldiers takes the hint and knocks you out cold.

You awake
a short time later.
156724: That doesn't quite fit.
156849: You hear a click.
156880: That doesn't quite fit.
156919: You hear a click.
156952: That doesn't quite fit.
156991: You hear a click.
157024: That doesn't quite fit.
157063: You hear a click.
157093: Some students walk by. They must be upperclassmen, as they don't even
look in your direction.
157159: Some students walk by. They must be underclassmen, as some of them look
at you with puzzled expressions.
157231: You do a bit of exercise.
157257: You do a bit of exercise.
157288: The index is rather terse, try limiting your lookup to one word.
157346: Apparently, in 680 GUE, Duncanthrax grew increasingly withdrawn. At
this time, of foremost importance to him was his collection of various battle
trophys and awards he had bestowed to himself (for unusual valor on the field
of battle) over the years. He decided to construct a hidden underground chamber
south of Egreth to sequester this collection, which would be locked in a most
clever means. He decided to order the construction of a "four-room key" which,
when a miniature trophy was inserted and removed (once) in a special keyhole in
each of the four rooms (in a specific order), would unlock a holding chamber in
a center room containing his prized trophies. Priding himself on his logic
skills, he requested that two captured foreigners produce a logic puzzle
plainly inscribed in the four key rooms themselves that would detail the exact
order that the key rooms were to be "applied". A Prevaricon, who could not help
but write untruths, was given a can of gold paint, while a Veritassi, who could
only write the truth, was given a can of silver paint. Imagine Duncanthrax's
rage when he discovered that the two prisoners had secretly painted over their
gold and silver key phrases with _black_ paint! The prisoners were summarily
executed, of course, but Duncanthrax sealed off the chamber and researchers can
only guess at the final fate of the trophy collection of Duncanthrax.
158212: Zilbo the third was overthrown in the great revolt lead by Duncanthrax
in 659 GUE. The biographers suggest reading their companion text "How Zilbo
Came to Mithicus".
158494: In 666 GUE, Duncanthrax invaded Zorbel Pass in the Eastlands and
severely trounced a local militia of trolls armed with clubs and garlic. The
key significance of this victory on Duncanthrax's conquest of the Eastlands, as
well as the immediate recall of all vampiric soldiers in Duncanthrax's military
force, cannot be understated.
158716: In late 666 GUE, Duncanthrax was engaged in a fierce battle with forces
near Globby Hills. In a brilliant tactical move, Duncanthrax goaded the
opposing force into decided the fate of the battle on a single duel -- himself
versus their champion. Unfortunately for Duncanthrax, the Globby Hill champion
turned out to be an Ogre of immense size. In an attempted diversion,
Duncanthrax was quoted as saying to the Ogre, "It's all right, we're with
Silvermane." The Ogre was quoted as responding with "Huh?". Duncanthrax then,
perhaps in a moment of sheer bravado, was heard to say "Your shoes are untied."
As the Ogre bent down to examine his unshod feet, Duncanthrax gave the signal,
and the Ogre was buried under a massive pile of granola.
159188: Silvermane, the book notes, was the name of Duncanthrax's pet Dire
Wolf.
159246: There appear to be notable entries on "trophy", "Zilbo",
"Griffspotter", "Diablo", "Ogre", and "Silvermane".
159327: You can't find anything interesting about that.
159386: You dig through the mess and find an unopened can of coffee and a
sugar-cube.
159435: There's too much to carry.
159468: You mess with the mess. Nothing happens.
159521: Some strange invisible force stops you as you try to leave. The
librarian doesn't look up, but merely says, "If you want to check something
out, I'll need to see some ID first."
159668: Some strange invisible force stops you as you try to leave. The
librarian doesn't look up, but merely says, "If you want to check something
out, I'll need to see some ID first."
159815: Some strange invisible force stops you as you try to leave. The
librarian doesn't look up, but merely says, "If you want to check something
out, I'll need to see some ID first."
159974: As you open the door, an enormous hellhound jumps out! The unusual
watchdog creeps back into the room and closes the door -- after having mauled
you to pieces, of course.
160141: You can't unlock the door from this side.
160171: The cover reads "Ancient Mythology".
160531: indeed, legends state that on occassions, the brothers would seek ways
to actually destroy their own siblings, along with the forces of good. One
brother constructed a strange artifact that would have given him great power,
but was discovered by agents of good. He was imprisoned within the very object
he built. The remaining three, facing certain defeat without the combined
strength of their trapped brother, fled into planes unknown, but made a pact
that if the brother were ever freed, and the artifact of power returned to him,
the four would agree to make their final attack against the forces of good.
Kroonwatz points out the obvious parallels with various other mythologies that
foretell the end of the known world."
160982: As you open the book, a small card flies out and lands at your feet.
161026: You're at the very front of a large auditorium. From here you can look
south and sees rows upon rows of empty seats focused on the stage-like area
where you now stand. You can walk back into the seats to the south
161146: . A soft dim glow highlights your current area.
161199: You hear a click. A dim light now makes the nearby area less gloomy.
161245: It seems to be on already.
161266: mtpingi clo withc with,
A student creeps out of the shadows. He looks
at you sheepishly. "Sorry I haven't been to class all semester, Professor," he
begins. "Anyway, here's my final paper." He puts a notebook on the desk. "All
this stuff about the new 'science' -- I don't know what all the fuss is about.
Magic was okay too, wasn't it? There's a part in my conclusion where --" He
stops and looks at the notebook. "Well, anyhow." he says, and disappears back
into the shadows.
161587: The dim light fades.
161605: It seems to be off already.
161844: You close the door and hear some mechanisms spin.
161874: Three dials are in a left-to-right row. Above each dial is a tiny
square window with some number visible behind it. The windows currently read: "

right above the dials read: "FrobozzCo".
162066: A small dial. The window above reads "

163122: Nothing happens.
163309: Attacking librarians is not very becoming of a priest.
163358: "Thanks no, I already have a pair."
163395: The librarian snatches the ID out of your hand. "Where'd you get my
ID?" she says. "I've been looking for it everywhere."
163536: Harold," she says. "I heard you were going to be away for a least two
more years. Got tired of Mithicus, eh? Well, anyway, remember to return
anything you borrow after summer session is over." She scribbles something down
in a notebook.
163686: The librarian is currently too busy cataloging books.
163727: The librarian frowns as you start to chant. "Quiet! This is a library,
you know." she says.
163796: You make an unusually high-pitched noise. The librarian frowns.
"Please! This is a library, you know."

understand at all.
164160: The chant fails.
164186: You begin your chant, and the kobold seems stricken with fear. Soon,
however, the kobold stands up and looks at his healed shoulder with wonder. He
starts to say something, realizes you don't speak kobold, and stops. Puzzled by
your actions, he stares at you for a moment, then searchs his jerkin, finding a
small object which he tosses at your feet. He walks off into the deep forest,
and vanishes.
164429: You hear a strange intake of air from the hole above your head. Without
warning, a small tornado seems to flow in from above. It seems to be sentient!
164518: mo ne sehn
The air creature moves with amazing speed! It surrounds you
in a mass of whirling winds, and you find yourself spinning helplessly. The
speed increases, and you are soon torn apart!
164647: ne sehn
The last blow from the air spirit was too much for you, I'm
afraid to say. You are picked up and tossed against the wall in a lifeless heap
by a massive gust of wind.
164914: As you speak the chant, the air spirit falls back in fear! You finish
the chant, and the air spirit slowly dissipates and grows smaller, until the
creature vanishes completely.
165017: A sharp gust of wind practically tears your chant out of your lungs.
165173: It's too busy trying to kill you.
165203: Well, when you see a living creature made out of dough around here, let
me know.
165250: The chant fails. I suppose you probably need actual dough for it to
work.
165303: The chant searches for a body to heal, and fails.
165340: You speak the chant, and feel a warm glow surround you. In moments, you
feel physically renewed!
165478: You're knee-deep in a murky swamp. Huge swamp grasses wall you in
165541: ahn. Drier land is north or south.
165571: You can't go that way.
165640: You hunt around in the grasses for a while and find nothing.
165686: You check the jungle map. Sure enough, there's a loose patch of grass
that you could duck under to the west.
165760: Grasses don't grow much more than this.
165813: A single native tribesman breaks away from the group and approaches
you.
165878: The group of natives looks at you with distrusting stares.

lost on them.

166257: You start to push the statue north, and hear a strange click. Suddenly,
two enormous stone rolling pins slide down from the east and west sides of the
room! Desperately, you topple the statue and hide behind it. You hear a huge
crash!

You open your eyes, surprised to find yourself not squashed into
pancake. The statue has wedged itself neatly between the two giant rollers,
effectively blocking them!
166494: You can't push the statue that way.
166520: The statue rocks back and forth a bit, but is far too heavy to take.
166624: You head north, and hear a strange click. Suddenly, two huge stone
rolling pins roll down from the east and west sides of the room! Desperately,
you try to escape, but the hall is too long, and the stone rollers too fast.
You are crushed to jelly.
166768: You step over and around the jammed rollers and the statue and head
north.
166830: The rollers are huge and stuck fast.
167109: You stick your hand down the small hole, but it must be quite deep, and
you can't quite reach.
167174: You're in a bare stone chamber which is partially filled with a sunken
pool of dirty blackish water. Near the south wall is a depression in the floor
that was probably a drain for the pool, given the apparent water stains;
however the level of the pool is below the point where it would overflow into
the drain. Near the center of the ceiling is a small round hole, right above
the pool. An exit lies west

Your amulet suddenly gives off a bright purple flash!

167920: There's a strange gurgling noise as you finish the chant, and the black
water starts to glow! But, to your horror, the inky water seems to absorb the
light and return to its original blackness! The chant fails.
168050: You notice the water seems unusually cold as you enter the pool.
Without warning, something grabs your legs and pulls you under! In pitch black
liquid that seems to absorb all light, you can't defend yourself, or even see
your adversary, who devours you shortly.
168204: You can't see a thing, the water is blacker than night.
168253: You drop the toy volcano into the black pool and watch it sink. Moments
later, a large large bubble rises, and pops at the surface, followed by a
strange, belch-like noise!
168379: falls into the pool and slowly sinks into the black water. Suddenly,
168523: The open umbrella sits in the pool, floating on the surface like a
cloth dome.
168574: You are in a stone chamber that has broken and eroded walls in several
places. Broken stones and dirt are everywhere. It appears there was once an
open archway east, however the heavy stones that framed it have collapsed. A
tiny hole remains, but it would be an exceptionally tight squeeze. A stone
ladder leads downwards into a dark hole
168789: dcu    mtprangn.

Your amulet suddenly gives off a bright purple flash!
168869: You try to squeeze through the hole, to no avail. You're carrying too
much to fit.

much to fit.

169334: A jungle native with a rather elaborate costume make of bird feathers
and animal hides. He seems old, but wise
169408: . Unlike the rest of the natives, this one is not wearing a fancy
feather-and-fur headdress.
169500: You try to convey your desire for the map with gestures. The shaman
seems to understand. He points to the map, then you. Then, he raises his hand
in a 'stop' gesture. Then, he points to his bare head.
169617: The shaman does not seem to understand.
169666: The shaman takes the headdress and places it on his head. He smiles,
and gives you a strange map in return.
169729: The shaman smiles and shakes his head.
169764: As you make a threatening move, several of the natives step forward and
pierce your body with stout spears. It appears they've had bad dealings with
outsiders before.
169871: The shaman nods and points to the headdress, then himself.
169906: The shaman says something in a language you've never heard before.
169943: You can't seem to communicate with him; their language is completely
foreign to you.
170010: You begin the sermon, but the shaman and natives seem very puzzled by
your speech, and clearly can't understand a word you're saying. The chant
fails.
170102: The map is somewhat crudely drawn:
170585: Some of the dirt and mud in one corner stirs! A form made of mud and
earth suddenly rises to attack!
170791: ne sehn
The last blow from the earth spirit was too much for you, I'm
afraid to say. The spirit slowly sludges towards you for the final blow...
170890: exnclubs you with a heavy pseudopod made of animated soil and rock.
Ouch!
171058: As you speak the chant, the earth spirit falls back in fear! You finish
the chant, and the earth spirit collapses into a heap of dirt and mud,
banished!

171325: It's too busy trying to kill you.
171355: You see a brief flash of light, but nothing happens.
171574: You feel a slight rumbling overhead, but nothing else happens.
171685: Your chant goes unanswered.
171706: Your chant goes unanswered. It's intended for plants only.

171983: You hear muffled cries for help from somewhere inside the log cabin!
172459: The treant is covered with a waxy buildup, which washes off in the
rain. The treant, already rather incensed, turns his attentions to you and
mauls you with two giant branches/arms.

proportionately! He turns his attentions to you and pounds you with two huge
branches/arms.
172682: The treant seems to turn a shade of deep green, and the patches of
blight disappear! The ancient tree creature pauses, regards you solemnly, and
then walks off into the forest.
172834: apm. It looks slightly damaged.
172865: . It looks partially damaged, the roof logs are broken in several
places.

173047: The angry treant seems to be in the way.
173070: It's just a tiny log cabin that probably has nothing interesting
inside.
173128: The outside of the cabin is now covered with spots of waxy buildup.
173178: Moments later, a woodsman appears from the battered log cabin. "Much
thanks, sir," he says. "Appears I mistook that treant for a dead tree and tried
to cut it down. Can't say he took it too well." he says sheepishly. "Say, you
don't look like you're from around these parts. Kinda like this funny thing I
found in the woods the other day." He hands you a strange round object. "Maybe
you know what to do with it?" He hefts a small hatchet over his shoulder.
"Well, back to do a little logging," he says, as he walks off into the deep
forest, whistling.
173532: othhn

hustling off without so much as an apology. You notice he dropped something in
his hurry.

173969: You step into the street, and several locals give you strange looks.
The surrounding neighborhood seems new and busy -- various construction sites
mark the work of enterprising shop-keepers of the area.

"Watch out there!"
someone cries. A sudden pile of bricks falls from a nearby scaffolding, and
crushes you.
174206: From behind some scaffolding, a construction worker appears. He walks
to a part of the ditch and starts to make some finishing touches on part of a
low wall. He finds a brick nearby and applies it to the wall with a good patch
of mortar.
174352: Brushing himself off, he walks off and is soon out of sight.
174394: He looks at the patch somewhat unsatisfied, but shrugs, and walks off,
soon out of sight.
174490: It looks somewhat unfinished. Part of it is open into a dark recess in
the side of the ditch.
174552: The wall is a finished work of brick and mortar. It looks quite strong.
174600: The wall is a finished work of brick and mortar. You see a spot where
the brickwork seems a bit lower in quality.
174686: The wall is currently sealed shut.
174800: You kick at the wall. Unfortunately, it wasn't all that stable, and the
wall falls apart, burying you under a pile of loose bricks.
174889: You try to break the wall, but only end up hurting your hand.
174932: You knock on the weak portion of the wall, and produce a slight crack,
that no doubt will cause the homeowners some worry in the future.
175027: The wall seems to start to glow a purple color, and you step back, to
find your surroundings replaced by cold natural cave walls.
175131: It's smells musty down here, as though the place has been unused for
quite some time.
175186: There's an open metal box attached to the wall here.

near the box.

wearing rubber gloves!
175653: No need to put things in the foundation like that.
175694: You briefly search the decaying foundation, but find nothing.
175842: Strangely untouched and undamaged, a GUE-Automatic oven is sitting open
in a corner of the room.
175933: It seems to be empty.
175948: It contains:
176086: A round dial with small printed words. A line on the oventop marks
which dial setting is currently active, which at the moment is "
176228: The line is now pointing to "
176275: The dial has somewhat unusual settings. You'll need to turn to the one
you want.

into the dough.
177010: You mix in the new ingredients into the dough.
177058: You mix the contents of the pan around a bit, but some things don't
quite coagulate, and the contents remain unmixed.
177157: You start mixing. Like magic, in short time you have a doughy mixture
in the pan.
177296: It's somewhat scattered about in the pan right now, and you can't quite
remove it cleanly.
177368: The cake takes up the entire space in the pan.

the shell.
177632: Ugg. Raw dough.
177693: As you speak the chant, the dough seems to twinkle! With a sudden puff
of flour, the dough spins and neatly kneads itself many times!
177794: You roll up your sleeves and start kneading. The dough
178017: Not bad. Unfortunately, it looks like you can't have your cake and eat
it too.
178071: You taste a tiny bit of the cake.
178132: It tastes a little burned.
178156: It's a little too soft.

178264: The vial breaks into shards, scattering holy water all over the zombie.
The zombie shrieks, and crumbles into dust.
178341: Your attack knocks it back, but it seems completely unharmed, somehow!
178429: The zombie seems to regard the gloves, and slowly puts them on. It
proceeds to open the metal box and remove a loose wire, producing a few sparks
in the process. Finally, it places the loose wire on the floor, satisfied. It
slowly crumbles into dust, but you just manage to hear, "Thanks, I've been
trying to get rid of that wire for ages," in the faintest of whispers.
178651: Zombies are usually not very responsive to those among the living. This
one is no exception.
178746: As you finish the chant, the granite wall is replaced by a large mass
of pasta. A hidden section of the room is revealed, along with the mass of gold
coins it was holding! The coins spill out, and nearly flood the room.

In a
flash, a large group of financial nymphs appear on the scene. "It looks like we
found the missing GUS earnings," one nymph says to another. Producing large
sacks, they quickly collect the mass of coins and disappear with a
twinkle.

Moments later, a single coin falls out of a crack in the previously
hidden alcove, rolling to a stop near your feet.

a screeching halt, the doors open, and several people rush out and exit the
station.
180624: You hear a distant rumbling noise from the south.
180702: A few exit the train, and hurry out of the station. You hear a voice
from inside the train say, "Doors will be closing, please stand clear."

disapprovingly. "Broken again? I thought they just fixed it. Well, fine." She
seems rather annoyed. "We'll get someone to look at it, eventually. Bye!" She
disappears.
183292: You poke the wire in the slot for a bit, but nothing happens.
183345: You poke around in the slot, and manage to free something! There is a

cautiously.
192934: The thug is too busy being sinister.

to yawn. Soon, his eyes blink slowly, and before long, he nods off to sleep!
Two subway police officers, hiding until now, get up the nerve to capture the
snoring thug, and drag him off, disappearing into the throng of people.
193151: You give the thug a timely sermon on the folly of crime in a moral
society. He seems momentarily fascinated. Too bad he wasn't actually sitting in
anything.
193254: mtprangn

car, and approaches. "A priest," he says, "Just the person I was looking for."

takeovers.

guy says, 'I thought you meant my _wife_.' Get it? Wife?"
193639: Much as you'd like to, that's just something the Order would probably
frown upon.
193704: You give a sermon on the dangers of improper bathtub caulking, but the
yupple seems quite fascinated. "That reminds me of..." You cringe.
193796: You draw a stunning parallel between corporate morality and monarchy
ruling. The yupple's jaw drops. "I've got to tell my boss that," he says, and
tries to leave his seat, but finds himself stuck fast. Several passengers
nearby take the opportunity to remove the yupple (seat included) to a different
part of the train.
194008: Try reading about 'news', 'sports' or 'features'.

raiding groups. 

A second story details the shocking death of a GUE Tech
student found in the subway tunnels in Gurth City Station, the apparent victim
of a GUS train. "Don't know how he got in there." a subway worker is quoted as
saying.

stair seems to twist and move as you step on it, turning like a corkscrew,
until you are graciously deposited at the top, far above your previous
location.
194938: A sight to inspire even the most avaricious, this storeroom is filled
with all sorts of rare and precious treasures. A hallway leads east
195028: . You notice that the west wall appears to be made of solid granite
195085: The west wall is a solid piece of granite, which seems very odd,
considering the other walls are clearly made of slate.

no need for such materials of excess.
195327: You manage to stuff yourself with pasta, but there's still quite a lot
left.

thought of eating more is enough to make you queasy.
195466: A museum curator appears and takes the painting. With an expert eye, he
looks closely at it. "This is a fake! I warn you sir, art forgery is a
dangerous game." He leaves, much disgusted.
195603: They both look so genuine! You can't decide!
195649: One of the paintings is surrounded by a bright yellow glow, and
disintegrates!
195710: Search which one? Goodness, you can't decide!
195751: You step through and feel your stomach twist. You stumble past a set of
open metal doors into...
195827: You step onto the square, and before you know it, your surroundings
shift and start to fade! You feel a sudden chilling wind. The ice seems to
lengthen and stretch. The gray plane slowly turns white and bumpy.
195979: You step into the black hole. You stumble forward, surrounded by
blacker-than-night darkness.
196065: lifahm
You step out into an underground chamber. A burly uniformed
figure sees you exit the tunnel and yells, "Hey, no playing in the tunnels,
pal!"
196167: You hear a rumbling noise echoed from somewhere, and the entire tunnel
seems to shake! Then, all is quiet.
196304: Suddenly, a huge train car appears heading north! You barely avoid
getting pulverized! Strangely, you watch as the train continues north, and
seems disappear into blackness nearby. It's as though the train was simply
removed from the tunnel somehow.
196463: You step into the depression. Your very surroundings start to fade,
replaced by sunlight that makes you squint! The gray plane undulates and
buckles and turns into a great body of water before your very eyes.
196640: feel a great sense of dread! Surely, given the way you got here, this
must be the domicile of a dreaded Implementor! The entire place feels strange
and alien and, well, "modern". There's some sort of kitchen to the east. Long
curtains cover what must be a window to the south.
196894: You hear some faint noises nearby.
197015: It sounds like someone is talking to himself to the west. You hear:
"Now, wait just a second here, the player object is gone! How did that happen?"
197125: It sounds like someone is talking to himself to the west. You hear:
"That can't be right. I must be getting tired. Think I'll make myself a nice
hot cup of coffee."
197232: You hear someone whistling a merry tune to the west.
197266: You hear someone snoring loudly to the west.
197310: You hear someone walking nearby. The footsteps soon fade to the east.
197360: You hear someone walking nearby. The footsteps soon fade to the west.
197432: You hear an irritated voice say, "What happened to my coffee maker?"
Slightly softer, you hear "Well, I guess I'll have that iced tea."
197533: You hear a voice to the east say, "Looks like I've got coffee, thank
goodness."
197594: You hear a voice to the east say, "Great, I'm all out of coffee. Good
thing I still have some iced tea."
197659: Shortly after this, you hear sounds of someone to the east starting
some kitchen activity.
197715: You hear some brief busy noises from the west, followed by what sounds
like someone drinking something. Shortly thereafter, you hear the sounds of
someone walking into the area from the east.
197827: You draw back the curtains and see a sight that beggars the mind!
Through the windows, the night sky falls across some unknown landscape, dotted
with strange bright points of light. Tall buildings seem to be everywhere.
Whatever world you've stumbled onto, it certainly is not your own! You hastily
close the curtains.
198015: In an attempt to hide, you part the curtains.
198050: The can reads: "Brand-X coffee crystals"

"Rich, mountain-grown
flavor."
198115: You'd need a good can-opener for that.
198142: It's a strange metal box. On top, perhaps connected in some way, is
another metal box with a glass plate on the front. Strange wires seem to be
attached to the boxes somehow. In front of the boxes is an odd plastic flat
object with rows and rows of plastic buttons labeled every letter in the
alphabet
198317: mtprangm.

Looking closer, you notice curious glowing letters on the
glass plate. You read the letters, and feel drawn to respond...

199070: You open the door, revealing a small room with what must be an
Implementor sitting behind a desk. The Implementor looks up, startled. "You're
here?" he says, observantly.
199197: The purple light in the chamber seems to pulse with energy, and find
your way blocked by an invisible force!
199264: As you leave, a sudden tremor shakes the cave! You just narrowly avoid
a sudden cave-in behind you!
199388: The sphere pulses with angry energy! It seems to be fighting the silver
rod piece you hold! With a sudden burst, you feel your mind reel and your very
surroundings change!

rod piece you hold! With a sudden burst, you feel your mind reel and your very

199982: A purple blast of force throws you back!
200044: The skeleton crumbles into dust, as though many years of time had
suddenly caught up with it in one moment.
200135: You close your eyes and leap out of the cave! You plummet through
silent white winds. Moments later, you fall right into an enormous snowbank,
and roll downwards, into...
200301: You drop the green rod and watch it roll near a mast and get stuck in
the floorboards.

There's a load crack! The ship is breaking apart! Sailors
scramble in vain for safety! You hang onto the side of the boat, but the vessel
rocks wildly, and you fall into the waters. 

As you sink, you notice the
waters seem to change to a purplish hue, and you find yourself back in...
200526: The sailors are holding you fast, so you can't do this at the moment.
200573: The ship breaks asunder! Sailors scramble madly and fall into the
violent waves! You hear the captain scream "Blast! I can't swim!" before the
waters cover you completely.
200714: Echoing in your mind, you hear a voice, that you somehow know is from
the black sphere. "Give me the rod priest, and you shall be immortalized as a
symbol to an entire civilization!"
200831: ' onsu qa clo nok onk yxn

one of the more powerful figures of your time!"
201289: towards you! In your mind, you hear "Hesitation, foolish priest, was
the downfall of the Ancient Ones" before you feel the full force of the void.
201378: Some Implementor. Looks more like a oddly-dressed young man badly in
need of a haircut
201432: mlpyou a,. He's also sound asleep!
201538: You manage to rouse the Implementor from his slumber. He stares at you,
bewildered. "What are you doing here?" he asks.
201616: He appears to be sound asleep right now, and isn't very responsive.
201702: The door to the west suddenly flies open! A somewhat bedraggled
Implementor steps out! He spots you and his jaw drops. "You, here?" he says.
201908: grabs you by the shoulder! "What are you doing here?" he says.
202096: You hear a door close to the west.
202377: You hear a roar from the east! From out of the sky, a giant white
dragon descends! It draws near, spots you, and bellows in rage! You shrink
back, and pray for a quick but painless end.

There is a loud crack! The
dragon, in trying to land, almost impales itself on the obelisk marker! Part of
the marker breaks off, and the dragon flies off, whimpering in pain!
202609: You disturb the sleeping dragon, who promptly makes you wish you
hadn't.
202652: Best not to disturb the dragon, I'd guess.
202704: You suddenly realize that you are being held fast by two navy sailors!
The captain walks forward and points his cutlass near your ear.

"What we have
here, lads, is a stowaway!" Some sailor cries out "Overboard with the
stowaway!" The captain smiles. "Now, we was planning on feeding you to the
groupers, but we could use a scullion in the hold. One things for sure, ye
ain't finding passage on this ship if ye ain't aligned with the Antharian Navy
cause!" Some sailor cries out (unnecessarily) "The Antharian Navy cause!". "So,
tell us lad, are ye with us? If ye are true, you'll tell me the Antharian Navy
patron saint! So speak quickly, lad, if ye wish to stay dry!"
203126: "Speak up fellow! We havn't got all day!"
203169: The captain sighs. "Into the water with ye, then," he says, and the two
sailors push you roughly overboard. You land in the sea with a splash, and
struggle to stay afloat. The ship sails off, but oddly, moments later, it seems
to stall and start to sink! Before you get a chance to reflect on this, a large
grouper swallows you whole.
203367: The captain's a bit too busy trying to save a sinking ship.
203429: "Aye, that's right. Escort the new scullion down to the hold where
--"

The captain's orders are cut short by a sudden grinding noise, and the
boat rocks violently! "Reef, captain!" you hear someone cry. "Blast!" the
captain says, "quickly men, we've got to --" But it's too late. The boat starts
to tip and sway, and the two sailors release you and hastily try to help raise
the rigging!
203685: The sailors suddenly pale at the mention of Lord Duncanthrax. "A
traitor in our midst, eh?" the captain shouts and beheads you with one stroke.
203779: "Nay lad, me thinks that was a sailor."
203807: "Nay lad, that doesn't sound right."
203850: Given that you are in the grips of several strong navy sailors, this is
impossible.
203950: The black sphere howls in rage and is no more!
203995: You feel a strange foreboding feeling as the black sphere seems to
engulf the rod, then you! Your surroundings change once again!
204077: The black sphere is unresponsive.
204150: The smoke-filled sphere howls in rage and is no more!
204201: You feel a strange foreboding feeling as the smoke-filled sphere seems
to engulf the rod, then you! Your surroundings change once again!
204289: The smoke-filled sphere is unresponsive.
204370: The gray sphere howls in rage and is no more!
204413: You feel a strange foreboding feeling as the gray sphere seems to
engulf the rod, then you! Your surroundings change once again!
204499: The gray sphere is unresponsive.
204570: The white sphere howls in rage and is no more!
204615: You feel a strange foreboding feeling as the white sphere seems to
engulf the rod, then you! Your surroundings change once again!
204694: The white sphere is unresponsive.
204718: You speak the chant. Nothing seems to happen.
204751: You see a brief flash of smoke, but nothing happens.
204789: You feel a slight rumbling beneath your feet, but nothing else happens.
204914: Your chant goes unanswered.
204943: As you step onto the silvery disc, you feel a strange jolt run through
your body. A bright white flash blinds you momentarily!

You blink, trying to
register your surroundings.
205134: As you reach for the strange contraption, you notice white sparks of
something arc from the silver surface to your fingers! You hastily draw back.
205296: There is a dazzling golden light as you join the two rod pieces! What
remains is a new, strange rod piece!
205364: There is a dazzling burst of golden light. However, the pieces will not
join, and seem to be seeking out something else...
205440: Some strange purple flash of force blocks your efforts.
205556: There is a dazzling golden light as you join the two rod pieces! What
remains is a new, strange rod piece!
205624: There is a dazzling burst of golden light. However, the pieces will not
join, and seem to be seeking out something else...
205700: Some strange purple flash of force blocks your efforts.
205816: There is a dazzling golden light as you join the two rod pieces! What
remains is a new, strange rod piece!
205884: There is a dazzling burst of golden light. However, the pieces will not
join, and seem to be seeking out something else...
205960: Some strange purple flash of force blocks your efforts.
206076: There is a dazzling golden light as you join the two rod pieces! What
remains is a new, strange rod piece!
206144: There is a dazzling burst of golden light. However, the pieces will not
join, and seem to be seeking out something else...
206220: Some strange purple flash of force blocks your efforts.
206337: You wave the rod, and feel a sudden blast of force! The spheres howl in
terror and suddenly explode! The jolt of power from the rod sends you hurtling
through space, and you are lost in an endless tumble through the void...
206508: You feel a strange surge of mystic energy as you join the rod pieces.
206585: !

Time and space seem to grind to a halt.

Your surroundings and the
very ground you stand on shatter like planes of glass, revealing a strange, new
dimension...
206715: The last sphere howls in rage and disappears!
206743: ne sepn You scream in agony as the void that surrounds you seems to
implode! You feel yourself dissipating into the surrounding nothingness. "Is
this my reward?" you scream, "Is this, then, the end?"

A white light makes you
open your eyes.

You are lying on a beach. The Great Sea laps at your tattered
garments. Slowly, you rise to your knees.

The sun, like a bloated, radiant
bird, is sinking below the wave on the horizon. Another day is coming to an
end.

A voice startles you. "Tis a fine spot for watching sunsets." You turn to
see Morgan the Ranger, Frobar and the Thief nearby. The Thief helps you to your
feet, and Frobar glances your way. "I sensed a great upheaval in the fabric of
time and space not long ago. I gather you have quite a story to tell," he says.
"We probably can relate to much of what you have seen, although your unwavering
faith is something we desire to understand." Morgan explains, "Belief in the
face of the unbelievable is an enviable strength." The Thief chuckles quietly.
"Perhaps you will join us at Delbins, where we will partake in a belief of fine
cuisine while you tell all?" he says. He notices your weary expression and adds
with surprising seriousness, "Not that I prepose to offer advice from one as
myself, but humbly, I admit, that many a time, a belief in myself was often
sufficient." He pauses. "Gods or no, now, you make your own destiny."
207601: You currently lack the means to do that.
207632: a.
You find yourself floating through the flaming wall! As you pass
through you feel a gut-wrenching sensation. Well, perhaps you would if you
currently had a gut, or sensations for that matter. Let's just say you feel
something akin to a gut-wrenching sensation, and leave it at that.
207807: A wisp of smoke appears to the northeast, then fades.
207855: A wisp of smoke appears to the south, then fades.
207899: A wisp of smoke appears above, then fades.
207943: A wisp of smoke appears to the north, then fades.
208008: You currently lack the means to do that.
208048: a.
You find yourself floating through the flaming wall! As you pass
through you feel a gut-wrenching sensation. Well, perhaps you would if you
currently had a gut, or sensations for that matter. Let's just say you feel
something akin to a gut-wrenching sensation, and leave it at that.
208236: Hnlarge flaming sphere.
208310: You find yourself drawn into flaming sphere. The ball of flame engulfs
you completely, and you feel nothing as inky blackness surrounds you.

"You
have revived him!" you hear a voice say.

You open your eyes. You are lying on
a long wooden table in the Monastery Steeple room. Several members of the Order
are gathered around you, and Brother Joseph helps you to your feet.

"We were
able to bring you back to the world of the living," Joseph says, "but I fear
our powers are waning, and we may not succeed if we try again. Your quest
continues!"

The group files out, leaving you alone in the room.
208715: A blackness surrounds you, replaced by more blackness...
208804: A blackness surrounds you, only to be replaced by...
208895: Hmm, perhaps the Grues really are migrating with the Great Change.
208943: ne sehn
Well, don't say I didn't warn you. Something horrible with
slavering fangs lurks up and devours you!
209889: You make a prayer and feel no spiritual response! Have the Deities
forsaken you? Or have you found a place where even the Gods cannot provide
guidance?
210012: You make a quick but respectful prayer to the Deities above, asking for
Divine Guidance in your quest. A saffron glow surrounds you and you feel
spiritually and physically renewed!
210119: You make a quick but respectful prayer to the Deities above, asking for
Divine Guidance in your quest. You finish and feel spiritually renewed.
210215: You feel superhuman!
210235: You are in good health.
210255: You are near death's door.
210277: You feel extremely weak.
210299: You feel weak.
210339: You've been better, but you'll be okay.
210364: You feel okay.
210390: Such language from a priest such as yourself! The ground rumbles, and a
bolt of blue wrath from the Deities strikes you dead!
210463: Such language from a priest such as yourself! The ground rumbles
suddenly!
210515: Get a hold of yourself. No need to go around shaking living things like
that.
210560: Nothing happens.
210866: I fail to see what you're trying to accomplish by doing this.
210906: I fail to see what you're trying to accomplish by doing this.
210946: This doesn't seem terribly productive.
210974: You close your eyes and focus your mind inwards. Mere moments of time
seem to pass like eons. You open your eyes.
211042: ARRGH!
211054: You make a rather sickly noise.
211085: "Stop that!" Frobar says, "It's contagious."
211125: Tired?
211134: A hollow voice says, "Cool!"
211158: Please, no begging.
211174: Was it that funny?

212340: You can't go that way.
212408: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
212436: As good-looking as ever.
212476: A thin rod made from some undeterminable material.
212504: A piece of blank parchment.
212524: A small hard sphere made from some undeterminable material.
212564: A short square piece of colored cloth.
212588: It looks like a chiseled-out niche in the floor.
212668: A long thin wooden beam.
212696: A long thin balsa wood beam.
212728: A long thin pine wood beam.
212764: A long thin ebony wood beam.
212800: You are standing in a monastery chapel. All around you, fellow Brothers
of the Order are standing, chanting. The eerie droning voices seem to
reverberate into the air. At the front of the chapel, Brother Joseph stands in
deep concentration, holding the Rod of the Ancients.
212944: You are in your room in the Monastery. It is sparsely furnished, but
certainly feels like home. The exit is north.
213012: The note, in a hastily written scrawl, reads:
"Please stop by the
chapel as soon as you can.
-- Joseph"
213084: This is your sleeping pallet, a short portable sleeping roll made of
straw. It's softer than it looks.
213148: You are in a hallway running west and east. The vaulted ceilings are a
nice touch. Your quarters are to the south.
213212: You are in a hallway running west and east. Brother TuffBerry's
quarters lie to the south. Brother Palemon's quarters are to the north.
213292: You are at the east end of an east-west hallway. Brother Joseph's
quarters lie to the north, and Brother Toolbox's quarters lie to the south.
213368: It doesn't look like Joseph is in. Perhaps you can find him elsewhere.
213412: You are at the west end of an east-west hallway. There are stairs up
and down here, and an exit to the west.
213472: You are in the Monastery gardens, where various shrubs and conifers are
covered in a light blanket of snow. An open cloister lies to the west, while a
doorway heads east.
213572: A small area in the snow has been cleared for late winter planting, and
some sand has been sprinkled here and there.
213636: A handful of sand, nothing more, nothing less.
213668: You are in an open cloister, that runs along the Monastery gardens to
the east. To the north is the main wing of the Monastery. To the south is the
entrance hall.
213756: This is the large entrance hall to the Monastery. Many a devoted
visitor has passed through this place. There is an exit to the outside world to
the south, and the rest of the Monastery lies to the north.
213868: This is the main hall of worship in the Monastery. A large domed
ceiling hides some sort of lighting that create a warm yet serene atmosphere. A
covered walk to the rest of the Monastery lies to the south. To the north is
the Monastery chapel. A brazier sits in the center of the room.
214028: This is a silver incense brazier, somewhat similar to an ornamental
bowl on a tripod. Brother Palemon supposedly found it on one of his many
journeys.
214124: You are in the Monastery Chapel, the site of the recent appearance of
the legendary Anabais. Signs of the recent visit include the slightly scorched
walls, and the reek of brimstone. Wood pews are arranged in a circle around the
central altar. The exit is south.
214272: Brother Joseph is a pale man, with gray eyes, a fine beard, and a finer
disposition.
214316: This small golden amulet and chain seem to shimmer with a strange
mystic saffron energy. The pendant portion of the amulet is in the shape of a
small golden cube.
214412: The altar is roughly the shape of a five foot white cube. The top edges
appear to be singed black and there are cracks and chips all over.
214492: A small glass vial of holy water.
214516: This journal is very strange indeed. Brother Palemon seems to have been
very preoccupied up to the point of his disappearance with strange accursed
places that he claims are located all over Quendor. He also makes several
references to evil 'spirits' found in these places. You also notice that
several pages of parchment near the back of the journal have been torn out.
214736: You are standing in a small chamber that obviously hasn't been used in
quite some time -- the cobwebs and dust are several layers thick. There is a
short crawl east.
214832: You are in Brother TuffBerry's quarters, vacant since he undertook his
quest for Joseph not long ago. The exit is north.
214908: This page was apparently torn from a larger document of some sort. All
that is left now reads:

"...fear. Just today I heard again something below me
when I was meditating upstairs. It sounded like a person, or something alive at
least was just below, trying to quietly move around unnoticed. Clearly this is
impossible, and yet I cannot doubt what I heard. Palemon tells me I'm hearing
spirits, but little does he know that I once heard the same noises in his very
chambers! He was not around at the time, but to the west, behind the wall,
I..."
215240: You are in Brother Toolbox's quarters, vacant ever since he left the
order due to differences many years ago. The exit is north.
215320: "-- <944 GUE> Today Brother Joseph tried to explain the essence of how
we channel magic energy through our amulets. To me, this seems to pale in
comparison with the seemingly innate abilities of those who call themselves
Enchanters. Joseph did show me a nice trick, however. He brought the Rod of the
Ancients near my amulet, and the amulet gave off a sudden purple flash of
light! I'll have to try that one on the Acolytes tomorrow."

(there isn't much
else of interest until the very last entry, which is not dated)

"-- So long
diary. I'm now off to seek greater spiritual guidance in Thriff. I hear the
summers there are very nice too."
215716: You are in a hallway on the second floor of the Monastery. The hallway
continues east, while stairs lead downwards.
215784: You are in a hallway on the second floor of the Monastery that runs
east-to-west. To the north is the private meditation room. To the east is the
Monastery library. To the northeast is an entrance to the steeple room.
215908: You are in a small bare chamber that is used for private meditation and
worship. The only exit lies to the south.
215968: You are in the Monastery library, a cozy, almost cramped room with
shelves of various books. The exit is to the west.
216036: Just some bookshelves.
216050: This sacred tome details the teachings and beliefs of the Order, of
which it's certainly always good practice to re-familiarize yourself with. The
scriptures are divided into several sections. Sections that can be consulted in
greater detail include:

"Doctrines"
"Demons"
"Spirits"
"(Book of the)
Mystical"
"(Book of the) Planes"
"(Book of the) Ancients"
"Legend of the Rod"
216304: "...are real! I have seen much evidence in the jungles of Miznia,
marshes of Fublio Valley, the ruins of old Egreth and in Aragain itself! I
believe that they are associated with certain basic elements in the surrounding
area. But they dare not show themselves now, not while magic is strong! Woe
unto us, should the powers of magic cease, as there would be nothing to stop
their terror..."
216544: You are in a round room with colored-glass windows. Wood beams line the
walls and rise to form a short point in the peaked ceiling above. A small
walkway returns to the southwest. A long wood table sits in the center of the
room.
216672: You are on a very narrow ledge outside the Monastery steeple. The snow
and wind are doing their best to send you to a ungracious death below. The
steeple roof is quite sharply slanted.
216780: It's hard enough staying on the ledge.
216804: This long wood table has been used for various private meetings and
impromptu get-togethers between members of the Order in the past.
216888: You are in a hallway in the Monastery basement. The hallway continues
to the east, and stairs lead upwards.
216948: You are in the Refectory, the general dining area for members of the
Order. You grimace at the lingering scent of Brother Pufpistery's favorite dish
-- Borphbelly stew. Several large oak tables and benches adorn this otherwise
bare room. An exit lies to the west, the kitchen is to the north, and another
exit lies to the east.
217140: You are in Brother Pufpistery's domain -- the dreaded acolyte kitchen.
A huge soup cauldron sits unused nearby. The refectory is south.
217228: This large iron soup cauldron has the unmistakable odor of Borphbelly
stew. Ugg.
217280: A heavy wood table with a well-used look.
217306: It's a recipe torn from an issue of "Better Homes and
Caverns":

GUILDMASTER SNEFFLE'S PRIZE WINNING BIRTHDAY CAKE 

Ingredients:

--
1 small sack of flour
-- 1 large sugar cube
-- 1 packet of baking powder
-- 1
stick butter
-- 1 large corbie egg
-- Dornberries, to taste

Mix the
ingredients together. Fold the resulting mixture the correct number of times (a
single gloth spell should do the trick). Bake in a GUE Automatic oven on the
"cake" setting.

Guildmaster Sneffle claims that "the dornberries are the
secret to making a cake even the King would be impressed with." He also notes
that "improper folding of the dough will produce very poor results."
217764: You are in a small cramped storeroom, stocked with various crates and
barrels of foodstuffs. The refectory is west.
217836: A large wooden barrel labeled "DRIED PRUNES".
217884: A small sack of flour, all-purpose.
217908: You are in an low underground cavern, made of roughly worked stone. An
even lower tunnel travels east.
217968: A wooden trapdoor in the floor.
217988: A wooden trapdoor in the ceiling.
218008: A ten-by-ten slab of solid steel, this wall must be at least a foot
thick, and is accented by large steel rivets that bolt it to the surrounding
rock.
218096: To the southeast, a huge steel wall demonstrates a marked contrast to
the otherwise drab surroundings.
218152: You are standing near the top of a snowy mountain peak. The wind is
quite cold and is making your teeth chatter. The general vicinity is mostly
snow and rock; however, the entrance into the Monastery is to the north, all
but hidden from view by the enormous slabs of snow-covered rock that make up
the cliff face. There is a rough but obvious trail leading down the mountain to
the south. There is also another trail that winds even further up the mountain
peak almost hidden in the snow to the east.
218436: You are climbing up a small trail that gets periodically lost in great
bluffs of snow. The swirling snow makes seeing an unusual effort. The trail
leads downwards to a cliff face to the west, and rises towards the mountain top
to the north.
218572: You are standing on a snow-covered outcropping. You are almost
waist-deep in snow, and the blisteringly cold winds aren't helping. The
outcropping juts out alarmingly over the western edge of the mountain. In fact,
you can see the Monastery steeple below this ledge. The main portion of the
mountain peak lies to the east.
218756: You are on a rocky mountain trail that winds up and down a mountain.
Patches of snow can be found here and there. The trail continues down the
mountain to the south, or up to the north.
218860: You are at a snow-filled crossroads in a mountain trail. Paths lead
north towards the top of the mountain, east, west, and south towards the base
of the mountain.
218952: The path east is blocked after a short distance by a huge snow drift.
219000: There is a large stone marker here, in the center of the intersection.
219040: You are at a snow-filled crossroads in a mountain trail. Paths lead
north towards the top of the mountain, east, west, and south towards the base
of the mountain.

Something seems familiar, yet different, about this place.
219172: The path north ends after a short distance.
219200: The path north ends after a short distance.
219228: The path north ends after a short distance.
219256: The path east is blocked after a short distance by a huge snow drift.
219304: The top pinnacle from the stone marker. You notice that it's partially
hollow inside.
219352: You're at the top of a short downwards slope into a snowy area below. A
path leads east. You could also slide down the slope. A lone tree stands here,
overlooking the slope.
219456: A leafless, bare tree, with what might be a bird's nest in it.
219500: Even from down here, it's a pretty big nest. Thankfully, no big birds
seem to be present.
219556: You've made your way down to a small snow-covered clearing, ringed by
pine trees. The only exit is back up the slope.
219628: There's a large boulder here, sitting squat in the middle of the
clearing.
219668: A big, snow-covered rock.
219688: There's some broken eggshell shards here, scattered all over. Some
gooey egg stuff too.
219744: Some large pieces of shell is all.
219768: You're on top of the tree, on some lower branches that seem pretty
stable.
219808: Overall, there's nothing terribly special about this tree.
219844: Given the size and Brother Joseph's lessons in ornithology, you'd guess
that it's a corbie's nest. It looks abandoned.
219916: A large speckled corbie egg.
219936: Some leafless thin tree branches.
219960: Cold, white and not in short supply.
219984: You are standing just north of a frozen river (probably a tributary of
Lake Dinge). You can just see the south bank from here, where the trail seems
to continue. There doesn't seem to be a bridge, however. A trail also continues
north.
220120: You are standing on a wide smooth river of ice. The river 'runs' east
to west, and there are banks to the north and south.
220188: You slide eastwards, and lose your footing, going nowhere.
220224: You slide westwards, and slip, going nowhere.
220252: You are standing on a wide smooth river of ice. The river 'runs' east
to west. To the north and south are huge snow bluffs that obscure most of the
surrounding countryside.
220348: You step eastwards but lose your footing, going nowhere.
220382: "Red beats smoke,
Silver bests clouds,
Green defeats depths,
Brown
stops earth."
220444: The ice is thick and quite smooth.
220468: You are standing just south of a frozen river. You can just see the
north bank from here, where the trail seems to continue. The only way to get
there is across the river. A trail heads south into a valley.
220580: You are walking along a valley trail, just below a portion of the Gray
Mountain ranges. You can see the beginnings of a city to the south, while the
trail winds further into the mountain ranges to the north.
220692: You walk around the local area a bit, finding nothing of interest.
220728: You are in Frostham City, the famous winter-lover's haven. The once
booming ski vacation spot seems to be a bit more run-down than in times past.
The city thins out towards the north, while another section of town is to the
south. To the west is a large wood structure. To the southwest is a small
building. To the southeast is another small building, possibly a store.
220940: You walk around the local streets a bit, finding nothing of interest.
220980: A dust-covered crate.
220996: A mold-covered crate.
221012: A filth-covered crate.
221028: You notice a loose board, partially broken, hanging from the ceiling
structure.
221072: A portion of the ceiling boards has apparently broken loose.
221110: The can reads: "Frobozz coffee crystals"

"Rich, mountain-grown
flavor."

DECAFFEINATED.
221188: A rather old-looking icebox.
221208: A dust-covered icebox stands closed against the northern wall.
221644: A quantity of overly-sweetened breakfast cereal.
221696: A single-use packet of baking powder from "Port Foozle Bakers Guild"
products.
221752: A good-sized stick of butter.
221772: You are inside a large ski resort. Perhaps it's not ski-season, as the
entire place is basically empty. Frostham city lies to the east.
221856: You don't have a lift-ticket. Also, you don't have skis. Most
importantly, however, the slopes look pretty lousy.
221932: You are in a waiting room in the house of the Frostham Governor. The
carpet is surprisingly plush. The walls have been painted a rather bland
peach-like color. The furnishings are also colored peach, which complements the
walls without being too nouveau. The way out is to the northeast.
222096: A comfortable-looking peach-colored couch is here.
222132: It looks pretty comfy, but the color wouldn't have been your first
choice.
222180: The brochure has pictures of various cheerful-looking people in rather
cheerful-looking places. Bold lettering reads "FEEL BETTER IN MIZNIA", "IT'S
ARAGAIN, AGAIN", and "NEW BORPHEE, EVERYONE'S FAVORITE CITY"
222388: A small, pullable knob on the back of the clock.
222416: You are in a rather spacious office. The carpeting is quite plush, and
all the furnishings seem excessively lavish.
222484: A fairly impressive looking desk, made from a massive lacquered piece
of black oak wood.
222540: It's just a thick door.
222556: You're near the southern end of the city. The rest of the city lies to
the north. There's also a rather conspicuous stairway down here.
222628: You can't go that way.
222640: You walk around the local streets a bit, finding nothing of interest.
222680: A tall lanky guy, like I said. He's decked out in fancy bright winter
clothes.
222732: A receptionist sits behind a desk, engrossed in the ledger.
222772: A gruff-looking lady who apparently is far more interested in her work
than you.
222824: The governor of Frostham is sitting behind a desk here, trying to look
busy.
222872: A sour-looking man who tries his best not to notice you.
222908: A tiny plastic whistle.
222928: A small plastic see-through package.
222952: A strange thing indeed -- a miniature ceramic toy, that has been
painted and shaped in painstaking detail to look like a volcano.
223034: "Frobozz Instant Volcano"

(parental supervision recommended)

To use: 
Just add a good quantity of water! We suggest a very large safety radius."
223144: You are just north of the newly built Aragain City. The general
vicinity is busy with important-looking people. A stairway goes down here,
while a large walkway heads south into Aragain.
223256: Before you is a truly astounding sight. A huge metal gate to the south
blocks the entrance into the newly built Aragain Royal Grounds. Worse yet, a
seemingly endless line of people stands before the gate. They look like
dignitaries, diplomats, or just plain politicians. A walkway heads north.
223432: The only interesting place seems to be past that gate.
223460: A god-awful line of well-dressed people. You notice that many of them
are holding what appear to be round pastries of some sort.
223536: There is a large sign bolted to the gate.
223560: A solid steel gate, probably 40 feet tall, complete with spikes at the
top and close-set bars.
223620: The massive gate is open.
223636: The massive gate is closed.
223652: You're standing in a lovely courtyard with magnificent topiary designs
and real marble walkways. A large gate stands to the north. To the east is a
red stone building with spires and columns. To the west is a large flat stone
building. To the south is a huge entranceway into what must be the new Royal
Palace, which appears to be carved out of the face of a massive mountain.
223868: Cleverly abused shrubs in the shape of giant crowns.
223900: You're in the entrance to a museum. The lighting is rather dim,
throwing light shadows all over the walls. There are exhibit rooms to the north
and south, or an exit west.
223996: You are in a small exhibit room designed with dark wood floors and
plaster-on-stucco walls. The room is dimly lit by hidden lamps or torches
behind recessed wall niches. The exit is south.
224104: Yes, there's a glass wall covering the north wall, all right. It's
exceptionally smooth and transparent.
224192: There is a priceless painting hanging on the north wall.
224224: It's a beautiful oil painting of a dark stormy scene. On the horizon,
you can see the edges of mountaintops. Near the top of the painting, two winged
figures are carrying a lone individual towards a break in the clouds, where a
bright white light seems to emanate.
224412: You are in a square exhibit room with wood flooring and plain plaster
walls. In the center of the room is an exhibit platform made from a large slab
of marble. The room is lit brightly by hidden torches. The exit is north.
224540: It's a large flat slab of marble, polished smooth, in the center of the
floor.
224588: There's an ancient wood vase sitting on the marble platform.
224624: An extremely narrow short wood vase, possibly for holding long-stemmed
flowers. It's clearly of ancient origin, well preserved, with strange carvings
and designs of robed figures all over.
224740: You are in a long stone room, which is strangely warm. In the very
center of the room is a hole, with a ladder down. An outdoor courtyard lies to
the east.
224832: There is a large sign posted near the doorway.
224860: "Welcome to Barsap's Royal Gambit, a delight to entertain all guests to
the Aragain Royal Grounds. Please consult your tourbook for rules and
regulations regarding this area. His highness, Sydney Flathead, and those in
his employ, cannot be held responsible for any accidents or minor spills at
this location."
225056: You are standing on a large floating white stone cube in a very large
underground chamber. The entire place is dimly lit red from somewhere below.
225136: As far as you can tell, you are standing on a large white stone cube
that somehow floats without visible supports in a terrifyingly large
underground chamber. The entire place is dimly lit red from somewhere below.
There is a ladder up to a hole high in the ceiling here.
225288: You are on the surface of a floating stone cube. You can barely see
another cube floating far above you in the dim red light that illuminates the
entire area.
225372: You are on the surface of a floating stone cube. The red light from
below seems a bit brighter here.
225428: In the center of the room is a large round hole, going straight down
through the floating cube.
225480: A large round hole cut straight through the giant cube you stand on.
All you need is a huge square peg.
225540: Sitting on the floor is a short smoke-colored rod.
225572: It's a short section of a rod made of some undeterminable hard
substance, colored smoke. A piece of the Rod of the Ancients, no doubt!
225652: It looks like a tower of animated flame.
225680: You're walking along a very narrow wood beam that runs east to west
into darkness. Below, you can see the dark silhouette of a network of beams and
floating cubes. Much farther below you can see a dull red glow.
225804: You're walking along a very narrow wood beam that runs north to south
into darkness. Below, you can see the dark silhouette of a network of beams and
floating cubes. Much farther below you can see a dull red glow.
225924: You're walking along a very narrow wood beam that runs east to west
into darkness. Both above and below, you can see the dark silhouette of a
network of beams and floating cubes. Farther below you can see a dull red glow.
226052: You're walking along a very narrow wood beam that runs north to south
into darkness. Both above and below, you can see the dark silhouette of a
network of beams and floating cubes. Farther below you can see a dull red glow.
226180: A long thin wood beam, barely wide enough for both of your feet.
226220: A vast hall runs north and south in this massive palace. Royal
trappings decorate the walls and ceiling, and red carpet lines the floor. A
tremendous open archway exits to the north into some courtyard, while two open
solid brass doors mark the entrance south into some audience chamber. Two
smaller exits head east and west towards stairways up and down respectively.
226436: This is a giant audience hall, equivalent to a large auditorium with a
throne on the stage. The hall is filled with luxurious decorations -- red
carpeting, expensive chandeliers, sweeping gold-edged drapery. The hall is also
currently filled with a large number of dignitaries and important-looking
people taking up all the seats. Open brass doors lie to the north.
226656: Just your average throng of official-looking people. Interestingly,
many of them seem to be smeared with flour.
226724: A large throne.
226736: This might have once been a lavish bedroom for royalty. At the moment,
it seems like someone has converted it into a private lounge of some sort. A
stairway heads down.
226836: A shiny key.
226848: A wooden cabinet stands against one wall, clearly a new addition to the
room.
226896: "...truth. In fact, the truth too terrible to believe, but believe it I
must, for all the evidence I have found indicates that the Ancient Ones went up
against the evil elementals and lost! With the Rod in hand, they were defeated
by trickery! The Rod was broken and scattered into the world, but can be
regained and rejoined by any whose heart and spirit are pure! Did the Ancient
Ones forsake the spheres of..."
227152: Dark and spooky, the palace dungeons seem empty at the moment. The
north portion of the room is sectioned-off by iron bars that form a makeshift
cell.
227240: A cramped space with a wall of iron bars.
227264: A tough-looking palace guard is standing by the gate.
227296: Typical guard -- big, armed to the teeth, and a sour disposition.
227340: There is a royal magistrate here.
227360: A rather nasty-looking thin tall fellow with an evil grin.
227396: A little red hat with no brim. It's unusually flat at the top.
227436: A tiny perfect brown sphere, made of some strange unknown metal.
227476: You're just west of Greater Anthar on the island nation of Antharia.
The bright sunlight seems to make the city streets east of here glitter. A
stairway leads down.
227576: You are standing in a busy section of West Greater Anthar City. The
city seems to thin out to the west. A roadway heads east, the ever-popular
Flathead Stadium lies to the northeast, and a pub lies to the south.
227700: You walk around the area, take in the local scene, and find yourself
back here.
227744: You are standing in a busy section of East Greater Anthar City. The
city continues to the west. There is a large odd structure to the east, made
mostly of glass. The ever-popular Flathead Stadium lies to the northwest. A
short walk down to a waterfront area is to the south.
227904: You walk around the area, take in the local scene, and find yourself
back here.
227948: A pleasant waterfront walk is your current location. You can see the
Great Sea stretching out before you to the south, a breath-taking sight. A rail
runs along the south end, preventing an untimely fall into the rock shore
below. The city is back to the north.
228096: There's a viewing telescope here, attached to the railing.
228132: A nice tourist toy. Perfect for getting a good view.
228168: You stand before the entrance to a large public conservatory. You can
enter the greenhouses to the northeast and southeast, or walk back to Anthar to
the west.
228256: A nicely arranged collection of desert plants is here in the "Desert
Garden". Bright sunlight and a sandy ground enhance the overall effect. The
conservatory entrance is to the southwest, or more gardens lie to the south and
east.
228392: A rather lovely flower garden lies before you. The multi-colored
flowers are turning the air into perfume. The conservatory entrance is
northwest, or more greenhouse gardens lie to the north and east. A tiny trail
leads south past the flower beds.
228536: A lovely assortment of flowers.
228556: This must be a storehouse for the conservatory gardeners. There are
soil stains and plant debris all over. The only exit is north.
228636: A plain toolshed.
228648: A toolshed stands closed against the wall.
228672: A cap with an odd green emblem stitched on the front that looks like a
clover.
228716: Basically a long pair of scissors.
228748: A pair of yellow rubber gloves, slightly worn. Good for gardening, or
washing dishes, I suppose.
228812: "...is true that those who go by the title of 'Enchanters' need not
wear any holy symbol through which to draw magical power. Indeed, it seems as
though the very amulets we must wear are our only link to magical powers at
all. Worse yet, the powers are indeed granted from powers above, but the
Ancient Ones? I think not. For indeed, I have found places where magic powers
will not work, with or without the amulet. Likewise, I have found places where
magic works, but praying to the Ancient Ones goes unanswered! What this all..."
229140: You are standing in a small well-kept garden. The plots surrounding the
paths are filled with a variety of general ground-cover plants, all appropriate
for most discerning homeowners. Exits lie north and south.
229260: A garden path winds through this narrow greenhouse, which is stocked
with various forest plants. The path winds back to the west and south.
229336: You are reminded of a hiking trip you took once.
229364: A garden path winds through this long greenhouse, which is filled with
plants native to jungle settings. The environment is somewhat humid. The path
heads west and north from here.
229468: Reminds you of a picture you once saw of the Miznia jungles.
229504: This small back room is apparently the conservatory nursery. Bits of
soil and plant debris are everywhere, along with immature seedling plants. A
exit lies west, partially covered by some cloth.
229624: A small red-ceramic flower pot, ideal for small plants, I suppose.
229668: A tasteful fountain intercepts a north-south garden trail here.
229708: A stone basin with a central fountain spout shaped like a fish. There's
no water running currently.
229768: It looks like someone left their glasses here.
229796: Thick lenses and a heavy frame.
229816: A small metal key.
229832: A group of dirty barbarians. One of them sees you staring at them, and
gives you a dirty look.
229888: A gaudy headdress of some kind is hanging on a nearby wall.
229924: A large headdress made of animal fur and colorful bird feathers.
229964: A long flat wood bar that could probably use a washing.
230000: A small glass filled with an amber liquid.
230028: A slightly dirty cleaning rag.
230052: Here stands the entrance into the still popular Flathead Stadium, home
to esoteric sports activities you never fully understood. Walkways lie
southeast and southwest from here, or you can enter the stadium to the north.
230176: You appear to be in front of Flathead Stadium once again, however
something seems different. Even the stadium itself seems dissimilar, newer.
Walkways lie southeast and southwest from here, or you can enter the stadium to
the north.
230308: A strange feeling compels you to stay.
230332: A strange feeling compels you to stay.
230356: A stadium event sign is pasted to one of the stadium walls here.
230394: "Today's event:
GOLEM FIGHTS!!!

ALL CHALLENGERS WELCOME!!!
THREE
ROUNDS, THREE BOUTS!
BIG CASH FOR THE WINNER!

(All Golems have undefeated
records, so
only trained golem-wrestlers need apply!)"
230592: A statue depicting the legendary Babe Flathead greets all visitors in
front of the stadium.
230648: According to the inscription, this statue honors the legendary Babe
Flathead.
230696: In front of the stadium is a square hole.
230724: There's a large square hole in the ground near the front of the
stadium.
230760: You are near the top cheap seats of Flathead Stadium. The crowd is busy
cheering whatever is going on down on the field. Looking at the field, you see
two small dots. The Stadium exit is back south, or you can walk down to the
front seats to the north.
230900: You try to push your way through the fans, but fail.
230928: You climb over a few seats, but the crowd blocks any further progress
west.
230976: You are near the good seats in Flathead Stadium. The crowd is busy
cheering for the current event on the field. Looking at the field, you see two
large dots. The seats continue up and south, or you can walk down to the field
below.
231104: You try to push past a couple fans, but the angry looks make you stop.
231144: You try to push past a couple fans, but the rude looks make you stop.
231184: You are near a locker room under Flathead field. You can enter the
locker room to the north, or start the climb back into the roaring crowd to the
south.
231264: You are inside a locker room under Flathead field. You can hear the
crowds outside. The room is empty. There is an exit to the south, and the
entrance to the field is to the north.
231360: You're on Flathead field, in front of millions of zany fans, a lifetime
dream. Or not. Well, anyway, there's a locker room to the south.
231444: A Christmas Tree stands in one plot, swaying back and forth.
231484: The Christmas Tree monster has obviously seen some good years. It
towers above you, wrapped with tinsel that sparkles marvelously. The plastic
flamingo ornaments are a rather gaudy touch. Surprisingly, it seems to have
taken root in the soil.
231628: A bunch of tasty-looking red berries.
231656: A small plaque sticks out of the soil near the two plants.
231692: A big man who's apparently into sports.
231716: A stout looking man in a funny striped shirt.
231744: The wood golem stands at about twice your height, an animated statue
made completely of wood. He may move like an old cabinet, but watch those
hands!
231836: The stone golem is quite a towering piece of work. He looks like a
crude statue made of animated granite. He probably has all the finesse of a
giant boulder, so don't let him pin ya!
231948: The iron golem resembles a huge nightmare made out of iron. Towering at
least 30 feet high, this animated iron statue isn't something you'd want to
meet in a dark alley, much less in an arena filled with screaming fans.
232080: She's nearly twice your height, and probably twice your strength too.
She's armed and armored in typical military Ranger gear. She gives you the
impression of being the type who'd hunt dragons as a hobby -- assuming there
were any dragons left to hunt, of course.
232244: A wizardly old figure of a man.
232264: A lean crafty-looking individual, dressed mostly in black. He seems a
bit too scruffy to be a nobleman, but also a bit too distinguished to be a
common thug. Probably a thief, I'd guess.
232384: A coal-black cloak, which blends into the surrounding shadows.
232420: Delbin himself is standing behind the bar.
232448: Delbin is a stout bald fellow with laughing eyes and a heavy beard. He
somehow seems both young and old at the same time.
232576: scribed on the side. You notice three odd bumps on the bottom of the
circular base.
232624: A small cloth bag.
232636: You are in a southern region of Fublio Valley, where someone apparently
decided to start a city. So far, a couple huts and farmhouses are the result. A
rather run-down farmhouse lies to the southwest, a trail runs through
grasslands to the south and a smaller trail runs along the hills to the
southeast. To the north, you see a decrepit old building. There is also a
stairway into the ground here.
232860: You amble around the local area a bit, and return here.
232892: You're inside what must have once been a small branch office of the
once indestructible Bank of Zork. However, the place has clearly been
abandoned, and age has not been kind. Even the required portrait of J. Pierpont
Flathead has been pilfered. An exit lies south.
233056: Basically a hollow rectangular hole cut into the wall.
233162: all regular account vaults have no funds) then it must be ensured that
20 zorkmids remain in basis, for potential loan requests.

Otherwise, vaults
must be maintained as follows:

For interest waiting to be paid, the amount
must equal the amount held in the loan payments vault. If this amount goes over
the loan payments, talk to your local gnome manager to see about getting some
outstanding loans paid back.

Overhead should be kept at the amount in
interest, plus five.

Loan payments should be kept at a positive amount.

Make
sure that both the loan and interest vaults are maintained properly, and at the
same time, the overhead vault is maintained while the basis vault is kept at a
non-suspended bank amount. If this is not the case, you may need to put some
overtime in to straighten out the bank funds.
233652: You're standing in front of a small farmhouse. A trail leads northeast,
a sand bar lies to the southwest, and another trail heads east.
233728: A small farmhouse, barely a shack.
233752: The winds are dead, and you're not going anywhere.
233784: The hole is too far above you.
233804: Salty blue-green water surrounds you.
233828: You're on the north shore of a small volcanic island in the middle of
Fublio bay. A little more shore lies to the south. The bay spreads out before
you to the northwest.
233920: You're on a southern section of a small volcanic island in the middle
of Fublio bay. Most of the area here is lava-rock, still warm. You can see a
more open shore to the north.
234020: An old shipwreck is almost embedded in the lava here.
234056: It looks like an old navy vessel, stuck fast in the surrounding rock.
Its obviously been underwater for some time, as it is covered in barnacles and
seaweed. The hull has partially rotted apart in many places.
234180: You're inside an abandoned lighthouse, on what must be an upper floor.
The whole interior is lifeless and barren. There's a large broken crack in the
western wall. You also notice a hole in the floor nearby, which might have been
an exitway a long, long time ago.
234336: There's a tired-looking farmer here.
234360: It looks like he's been working pretty hard in the sun.
234396: It looks like a large moving mass of seawater, in a somewhat man-like
shape.
234440: He looks quite crazed -- his wild eyes are almost unbearable to watch.
His clothes are complete tatters, and he looks rather emaciated.
234528: A fairly large sack made of furs and animal hides.
234560: "...evidence that there are more demons like the evil Anabais! In fact,
I suspect that four demons, not one, faced the Ancient Ones in spiritual battle
at the dawn of time! To suspect this is..."
234680: In the center of the room is a short gray rod.
234708: It's a short section of a rod made of some undeterminable hard
substance, colored gray like murky water. A piece of the Rod of the Ancients,
no doubt!
234796: A tiny perfect silver sphere, made of some strange unknown metal.
234836: You're right in the middle of downtown New Borphee -- perhaps the
busiest, most crowded city you've ever seen. Huge brand-new buildings and
throngs of fast-moving people make the whole scene somewhat surreal. The
streets head north to a business district, while a set of stairs here leads
down.
235016: You walk around downtown a bit, are appalled by the sights, and hastily
return here.
235064: You're in a crowded business district filled with busy people. The city
thins out a bit to the north, while city streets head west and south. Directly
to the east is a building so tall it makes you dizzy just looking at it.
235196: You're on some busy side street in New Borphee. There's a crowded walk
back east. To the north is the entrance to some sort of open area, with a large
open arch.
235292: A large metal and stone arch. You'll have to get closer to see anything
more.
235340: You're inside a gigantic skyscraper. The marble and brass fixtures and
trim exude professionalism. There's a small open chamber to the north. City
streets are to the west.
235440: You can't go that way.
235452: There is a large sign posted near the small chamber.
235484: You are inside a cramped metal room, with featureless walls. There are
no obvious exits.
235536: The doors seem to be closed tight.
235556: There's a small paper sign attached to a wall.
235624: A suburb starts here, in contrast to the start of a big downtown to the
south. For a residential area, it's surprisingly crowded. A main street runs
north-south here.
235724: New Borphee stops here, although it probably won't for long. A rough
trail leads off into some woods to the northwest, or you can enter the city to
the south.
235816: Accardi-By-The-Sea is closed to visitors these days.
235852: Deep forest surrounds you. A rough trail runs north and southeast.
235888: You're on a nice new bridge crossing some large river below. Trails
lead north and south into woods.
235948: Just a large east-west river.
235972: A beaten trail cuts through some very dense forest running north and
south.
236012: A forest ravine opens into some sort of clearing to the north here, or
a trail heads south.
236064: A group of well-armed soldiers, who look a little haggard.
236104: A wicker cage, with two compartments, and a lever attached to the
front.
236152: A wooden lever attached to the cage.
236184: A red square of cloth.
236208: A red square of cloth.
236232: A blue square of cloth.
236256: A blue square of cloth.
236272: A sleek, speckled salt-and-pepper windcat, with large paws.
236312: A sleek, spotted black-and-white windcat, with large paws.
236352: A open clearing is surrounded by forest trees here. A ravine pass is to
the south, and a short trail heads northwest. You can just see a small cave
opening to the northeast.
236448: There's a violent battle taking place in the middle of the field.
236484: It's a fierce battle. Kobolds and soldiers are locked in mortal combat.
Getting too close would be certain death.
236552: There's a small area of forest surrounded by brambles and shrubs here.
A trail leads southeast.
236604: A small cave mouth enters into darkness to the north here. A clearing
lies to the southwest.
236656: You're in a natural cave tunnel running north and south. To the south
you can see a glimmer of daylight.
236716: Several natural cave tunnels intersect here, running north, south, and
east.
236764: A natural cave tunnel makes short twists and turns here, running south
and east.
236812: You're in a small cave with noticeably damp walls. Exits lie to the
west and south.
236860: You're in a windy tunnel that gradually slopes up to the east, or down
to the west. A cold breeze blows from a tunnel to the north.
236936: A strange wind seems to howl through this winding tunnel heading east
and west. A crack in the tunnel wall exposes an exit north.
237008: A bare cavern. The exit is west.
237032: "...places no mortal man should go, There are planes of existence far
beyond our own, that connect and interlace, so that even mortal man may tread
upon the featureless gray of <smudge>. But, I believe that there may be other
planes, perhaps where the Implementors are said to live. Are these places just
parts of existing planes or planes unto themselves? I do not..."
237260: You're in a stone hallway, clearly man-made. The dust and musty smell
indicate the place hasn't been used in quite some time. The corridor runs
north, while the south wall has a large crack, creating a dark opening.
237388: You're at the north end of a long stone hallway. You can follow the
hallway back south, or you can take a set of cracked stone stairs up.
237464: The ceiling is too far above you.
237484: It looks like a slightly recessed circular depression in the ceiling.
It's hard to tell from here if it was something cut out of the stone, or
perhaps it's a separate piece.
237588: You're in a small domed stone room. The only exit, unfortunately, is a
hole in the stone floor to a floor of another chamber far below. Engraved in
the wall is: "LORD DUNCANTHRAX'S PRIVATE TROPHY ROOM".
237732: You're in a small domed stone room. There appear to be no exits -- the
hole in the floor appears to have been sealed with stone. Engraved in the wall
is: "LORD DUNCANTHRAX'S PRIVATE TROPHY ROOM".
237872: This is a bare cubical stone chamber. Some worn black lettering on the
wall reads: "THE EAST CHAMBER IS NOT THE FIRST TROPHY ROOM". An archway exits
south.
237996: This is a bare cubical stone chamber. Some worn black lettering on the
wall reads: "THE NORTH CHAMBER HAS SILVER LETTERING". An archway exits west.
238116: This is a bare cubical stone chamber. Some worn black lettering on the
wall reads: "THE EAST CHAMBER HAS SILVER LETTERING AND I HAVE GOLD LETTERING".
An archway exits north.
238264: This is a bare cubical stone chamber. Some worn black lettering on the
wall reads: "EITHER I AM THE SECOND TROPHY ROOM AND THE NORTH CHAMBER IS THE
LAST TROPHY ROOM, OR I HAVE GOLD LETTERING". An archway exits east.
238464: You are in a large man-made underground chamber, with a perfectly domed
high ceiling. Smooth stone archways lead to rooms to the north, south, east and
west. Stone cut steps lead down. In the very center of the ceiling you notice a
circular hole.
238608: It's a small circular hole shrouded in darkness.
238640: You're standing under an open archway that has the letters "GUE TECH"
prominently displayed in twisted brass and copper. A busy street lies to the
south, and the campus quad opens up to the north.
238760: It's an elaborate metal and stone affair that probably cost a fortune.
On one side, an inscription reads "Forburn Gate".
238840: You're walking across a grassy field. More lawn lies to the north,
while an archway exits the area to the south. To the west is a low stone
building with the word "GYMNASIUM" etched in stone across the entrance. To the
east is a old brick building covered in ivy.
238996: The center of the campus is a nicely tended green lawn with a bronze
statue in the center. Paths lead north and south across grassy fields. To the
west is a small brick building. To the east is a large stone building with a
lintel roof and the words "WOOMAX LIBRARY" enscribed across the entrance.
239176: An old bronze statue of a wise-looking man in wizard's clothes with a
stern, disapproving look. An inscription at the base reads "BELBOZ AT
MITHICUS".
239280: You're walking across a grassy field. More lawn lies to the south,
while a large building that resembles a auditorium of some sort is north. An
inscription near the entrance reads "ENCHANTER HALL". To the west you see a
small house-like building. To the east you see a low stone building, clearly
new and rather modern looking in contrast to its surroundings.
239492: There's a large field house here, filled with gym equipment and helpful
rubber mats. The exit is east.
239552: Various things useful to those who exercise.
239584: Someone left a key here.
239600: A flat metal key with "102" marked on one side.
239632: You're in the humanities building, which is vacant and closed for the
summer. The exit is west.
239688: Someone left a history book here.
239838: bit about some secret trophy chamber that Duncanthrax had constructed
near the end of his reign, but for more details, I'd suggest "look up (word) in
book" specifically.
239944: A small cramped area with lots of tables and chairs and food stains.
The exit is east.
239996: Someone must've had a late night recently, as there is quite a mess of
coffee cups, napkins, and other junk on one table.
240084: A perfect featureless white cube (of sugar).
240116: A student library is here, filled with various texts. The exit is west.
240160: There's a wrinkled magazine ("US News and Dungeon Report") here.
240206: SPIRITWRAK Author notes:
3/96 -- Initial (beta) release. Functionally
complete, some nagging bugs and typos may still be present.
4/96 -- Second
release. Reported bugs fixed. A few puzzles added, some removed.
6/96 -- Third
release. Bug fix release.
240400: You're in a short hallway inside some student dormitories. The exit is
east.
240448: You wander the halls a bit and return here.
240472: There's a closed door to the north.
240492: There's an open door to the north.
240512: A wooden door with a keylock. A note attached to it says "DOING WORK
ABROAD".
240572: There's a closed door to the south.
240588: A wooden door with a keylock. A note attached to it says "BEWARE OF
DOG".
240644: A slightly dirty ID card. There's a picture of some woman with short
dark hair and glasses, and the name "Stephanie" on the front.
240724: An ID card with a picture of some young student and the name "Harold"
written on the front.
240780: A cramped room, mostly empty, with some bare furnishings.
240816: There's a closed door to the south.
240832: There's an open door to the south.
240848: An unremarkable wooden door.
240868: A forgotten textbook is lying in one corner of the room.
240904: You're at the top of a large auditorium which is empty. You can walk
down a long aisle to the front of the hall, or out to the south.
240976: There's a curious switch in the wall here.
241000: A small switch in the far wall.
241020: A long desk sits in the middle of this area.
241044: A plain white notebook with some loose pages.
241072: "Magic, so what's it good for?" by Wilbur Lunchbox. It's a long-winded
haphazard writing about the virtues of magic in a time of science. Some of the
topic sentences are particularly clumsy. However, there's an insightful bit at
the end about how under certain circumstances, magic and science become
indistinguishable.
241272: You are in a short hallway of some new building. The words "SCIENCE
CENTER" are painted on one wall. The hallway opens to rooms to the east, or you
can escape to the west.
241376: You shudder as you look around this area. Clearly a place of science,
piles of heavy machinery and strange delicate-looking tools and artifacts are
everywhere here. Hallways run west and east.
241488: "On the Structural Strength of Woods", a short, fairly dry research
paper. Apparently, the researcher was testing the breaking point of various
woods. The conclusions reached are summed up in the final paragraph:

"In
summary, our findings indicate that out of the materials tested, Ebony wood is
clearly the best choice, and Balsa wood clearly the worst. Balsa wood
structures broke immediately when even the slightest weight was tested on them.
Pine wood structures fared slightly better, holding light weights, but tended
to break on repeated stress. Ebony wood structures were approximately twice as
strong as Pine structures, holding up to at least one repeated stress test
before breaking."
241920: You're in a small office of some sort. The only exit is west.
241956: A small desk sits in one corner here.
241980: It's quite tiny really.
241998: Some loose handwritten pages read:

"...DAY 14)  We've put the artifact
in the south lab. Still 
             no idea what it does, but I'm sure I can
find 
             some lab student who can figure it out. 
    DAY 20)  My lab
assistant Peabody believes that it's 
             some sort of 'mystical
gate'. 
             Clearly this is hogwash. However 
             my grant
has been awarded, so I have allowed 
             Peabody to continue work. 
  
 DAY 25)  Peabody demonstrated something fantastic today. 
             He took
my briefcase and put it on 
             the artifact and in a white flash, it
was gone! 
    DAY 27)  This is my last entry. I am leaving the University 
   
         tomorrow. Peabody, in my request to retrieve my briefcase 
           
 stepped onto the artifact, and was gone! I've read 
             his recent
research notes, and if he's right, he's 
             now lost in a place
unimaginable! I've locked the  
             artifact away and destroyed the
combination -- I pray no 
             one ever sees it again!..."
 (The
journal breaks off here)
242736: A large door made of some shiny hard metal. There are no obvious
handles or hinges.
242784: There's an odd set of dials in the wall near the metal door.
242816: A small green button next to the dials.
242840: This is an odd room, cramped even by lab standards. The place seems to
have been cleared out recently.
242904: A young woman with short dark hair and gold-framed glasses.
242944: There appears to be a wounded kobold here, resting against a shrub.
242988: He's a pretty tough looking kobold. The large wound in his shoulder
clearly has him in a foul mood.
243048: It looks like a small, animated tornado capable of taking you for quite
a spin.
243096: There's a pen-marked scroll sitting amongst some books here.
243132: In the center of the room is a short white rod.
243160: It's a short section of a rod made of some undeterminable hard
substance, colored cloud-white. A piece of the Rod of the Ancients, no doubt!
243244: A tiny perfect green sphere, made of some strange unknown metal.
243284: The Great Change certainly hasn't changed the ultra-swank city of
Mizniaport. The entire place is filled with splashy color and a disturbing
sense of moderness. There's a stairway down here, while side walkways head west
and northeast.
243428: Overly cozy-looking homes sprout up all over the place here.
Ridiculously well-trimmed front lawns remind you that you're still in Miznia. A
nice pebble path heads east and west. You see the entrance to a swank-looking
boutique to the south.
243572: A ultra-swank accessory store, filled with flashy items for the
fashion-unconscious shopper. An exit lies north.
243644: The sign reads "PLEASE RING BELL FOR SERVICE"
243692: The city stops here abruptly. The Miznia jungle makes its presence
known for real here, forming a natural barrier. A path leads east, while an
almost overgrown path leads into the jungle to the southwest.
243816: Wild birds and wilder vegetation distract you from a faint trail
through the jungle here. The path leads northeast and southwest.
243888: You're in very deep jungle, just on the verge of getting lost. Your
surroundings are green and untamed. A path leads northeast, while a muddy path
heads south.
243980: Tall, thick swampgrass.
243996: The Jungle clears out a bit here, so you can actually see patches of
sky and walk ten paces without running into a tree. There's a path into the
jungle undergrowth to the north. You notice a group of jungle natives gathered
here.
244128: A group of jungle natives in elaborate feather and fur clothing. They
appear to be armed with large spears.
244192: Hidden here in some extremely deep jungle are the ruins of some ancient
civilization. Broken sandstone structures are nearly covered with jungle vines
and mosses. There is a partially intact structure to the north. It seems to be
a short pyramid-like building, with a single dark entrance hidden amongst
vines. Definitely a find to write the Monastery about, or at least your local
Archeology Guild.
244432: A damp, dark, unmarked stone room. You can hear the sounds of the
jungle from the exit to the south. There are dark passages north and east.
244508: A tiny dark chamber, with a passage west.
244536: A stone statue of some ancient warrior, probably intended to frighten
off visitors.
244588: This is an odd long hallway running north and south. The stone floor is
noticeably concave, sloping upwards to the east and west. It's like being in a
long stone channel.
244688: The floor gets too steep, and you slide back down.
244716: The floor gets too steep, and you slide back down.
244744: There are two stone rollers pinned against the statue.
244776: Massive stone rolling pins.
244796: You are in a bare stone chamber with passages leading north, east,
south and west. A stone ladder also heads upwards through a dark hole in the
ceiling.
244880: You're in a small bare chamber. On one of the walls, you notice an
engraving, almost worn away with age. It seems to be a picture of a jungle
village, and you recognize the pyramid you are currently in. An exit lies east.
245008: You're in a rather bare chamber. On one of the walls, you see a worn
engraving depicting a group of robed figures standing in some chamber. They are
carrying several long reeds. An exit lies south.
245116: You're in a small stone chamber. In the center of the floor is a
strange funnel-like depression, which starts as a large circular opening, and
narrows into a very small tunnel below, probably no wider than your hand. You
also see a small round hole in the ceiling above. An exit heads west.
245288: You'd never fit down that opening.
245308: You can't reach the hole, and besides, you'd never fit through it if
you could.
245352: You see a dark small hole in the center of the ceiling.
245384: A smooth funnel in the stone in the floor, that descends into darkness
as it narrows.
245436: You are in a bare stone chamber with passages leading north, east,
south and west. A stone ladder leads upwards and downwards into dark holes.
245516: You're in a small bare chamber. Engravings on the wall show several
robed figures in a low domed chamber. Some of the figures are pushing what
appears to be reeds down a small hole in the ground, while others stand by and
seem to be praying or engaged in some ceremony. In a separate scene, similar
robed figures can be seen throwing some poor bound individual off the top of
the pyramid, apparently in some sort of ritualistic sacrifice. An exit heads
south.
245776: You're in a small bare chamber. Engravings on the wall depict several
robed figures in a room mostly filled with water. The figures are watching
reeds that seem to fall from the sky and land in the water. Several reeds are
floating towards an apparent drain in the water, where a few reeds that are
thin enough fall through with the flow of the water. An exit lies east.
245976: You're in a rather small chamber. Engravings on the walls depict
several robed figures in a strange room with a circular depression in the
ground, filled with water. Water also flows into the pool in a thin stream from
some undrawn source above. With the stream of water, a few reeds appear to be
falling. A single figure is collecting the reeds as they fall and placing them
in a long thin vase or container. The significance of this is uncertain. An
exit lies north.
246244: You see a dark small hole in the center of the ceiling.
246276: A smooth drain opening in the stone in the floor, that descends into
darkness.
246324: You're in a tiny low room, dimly lit by strange glowing lichens and
mosses. A tiny exit lies west between some collapsed rock -- it looks like a
very tight squeeze. The room is otherwise filled with broken rock and the like.
A tiny round hole is in the very center of the floor.
246488: You can barely fit your hand in the hole.
246512: A smooth round hole in the stone in the floor that descends into
darkness.
246556: A stuffed toy has been left unattended on someone's lawn.
246592: A cute little stuffed toy alligator.
246616: You're in front of a rather swank looking house to the northeast. To
the southwest is the rest of Mizniaport.
246724: "Enchanter Monthly" has been somewhat lacking in quality content these
days (The absence of magic probably being a large factor behind this). For
filler, the editors have been turning in mostly tabloid drivel articles about
"What ever happened to so-and-so?". This month's cover story suggests that
Barsap the magician was actually turned into a tortoise during the Great
Cataclysm, and underwent a slow mutation into a newt.
246992: It looks like a large moving mass of mud and earth, in a somewhat
man-like shape.
247040: Partially buried in the mud is a scroll.
247068: In the center of the room is a short black rod.
247096: It's a short section of a rod made of some undeterminable hard
substance, colored an inky black. A piece of the Rod of the Ancients, I'd
warrant!
247264: A foggy sky covers the ever-busy city of Gurth. A road heads southeast
into a larger portion of the city, and stairs lead down here.
247348: Probably the safest district in Gurth, the North District is mostly
cobblestone roads and barricaded buildings. A main road heads south, or forks
northwest and northeast.
247452: Dark forest meets dark city outskirts here. The only exit is along an
old path to the southwest -- the forest is too thick for travel otherwise. Rain
falls periodically from a dark stormy sky.
247564: It does look a bit stormy overhead.
247588: Treants are basically animated trees. They are considered mythical
creatures, usually solitary and quite rare. This particular treant looks
similar to a great elm tree. You notice that it seems covered with spots of
some sort of blight.
247732: The famous Gurth Market District is as noisy, crowded, and dangerous as
it ever was. A cobblestone road heads north and south here.
247816: "Get out 'o me way!" some rude fellow says as you try to pass.
247856: "No push'n, no shov'n!" some old hag screams at you, and promptly
shoves you back.
247908: The general gloomy atmosphere is more noticeable than ever here, in the
extremely dangerous South District. The general area is filled with boarded-up
houses, and a few shifty-eyed characters are the only people milling about
here. A road leads north. To the east is an abandoned flat, probably in better
shape than the rest.
248104: You're standing at the rotting front steps of a small flat. The front
door to the east has been battered down and you could probably walk right in,
or return to the street to the west.
248208: You're standing near a small construction site. A city street lies
west, and a construction ditch is east.
248276: An old discarded brick lies nearby.
248300: An old brick, slightly cracked in several places.
248332: This is a long square ditch that is likely to be the starting point for
some building. It is framed by wood slats and short brick walls. The only way
out is to the west.
248428: A thick brick lies nearby.
248444: A thick brick, solid as a rock.
248464: You notice a foundation side wall in the ditch.
248492: A bare room, with peeling paint and rotting, water-stained walls.
There's a room to the east, and a rickety stairway down. The outdoors lie west.
248576: A musty, smelly basement. Stairs head up.
248604: There's a dusty metal box attached to the wall here.
248636: A dusty metal box, attached to the wall.
248664: A thin stiff string of metal.
248684: A large break in the wall exposes a good portion of the house's
foundation.
248732: Water damage, or simply age, has exposed a large hole in one of the
walls, through which you can see exposed wood and brick, part of the foundation
of the house.
248828: You're in the kitchen, by the looks of things. Some broken cabinets are
on the wall. Light from partially boarded-up windows lets you see the rotting
wood floors. Rooms lie to the north and west.
248936: Strangely untouched and undamaged, a GUE-Automatic oven is sitting
closed in a corner of the room.
249000: A FrobozzCo best-seller -- this small green oven is perfect for those
adventurers who want a home-cooked meal, but are short on time and space.
There's a dial and a button on the top.
249116: A small round black button on the top of the oven.
249144: This was once probably a pantry of some sort. It's now a bare
closet-sized room. The exit is south.
249204: It's a nice round flat-bottomed ceramic pan.
249244: A heap of white flour.
249272: Some sugar scattered about.
249312: A small pile of very fine white powder.
249352: The yolk and the white parts from an egg.
249376: There's a sticker stuck to the bottom of the pan.
249402: Frobozz Magic Baking Pan

HELLO, BAKER!

To mix ingredients placed in
pan, simply say 'MIX PAN'. Baked goods should be removed with a Frobozz Magic
Spatula.
249524: It looks like a nice beige lump of uncooked dough.
249556: A frightening gaunt member of the living dead, with pale skin, and even
paler eyes.
249608: A tiny perfect red sphere, made of some strange unknown metal.
249648: You are standing at the entrance to the Aragain Great Underground
Subway (GUS) station. The train platform lies past the gate to the southeast,
or stairs lead up into the city. Some lettering on the wall reads "TRANSFER
STATION".
249788: You are standing at the entrance to the South Fublio Valley Great
Underground Subway (GUS) station. The train platform lies past the gate to the
southeast, or stairs lead up into the city.
249896: You are standing at the entrance to the Greater Anthar Great
Underground Subway (GUS) station. The train platform lies past the gate to the
south, or stairs lead up into the city.
249996: You are standing at the entrance to the Gurth City Great Underground
Subway (GUS) station. The train platform lies past the gate to the southwest,
or stairs lead up into the city. Some lettering on the wall reads "TRANSFER
STATION".
250140: You are standing at the entrance to the New Borphee Great Underground
Subway (GUS) station. The train platform lies past the gate to the southwest,
or stairs lead up into the city.
250244: You are standing at the entrance to the Miznia Great Underground Subway
(GUS) station. The train platform lies past the gate to the southwest, or
stairs lead up into the city.
250344: A helpful subway worker says "Hey pal, get outa there!"
250380: A metal gate bisects the fence.
250400: It's an odd metal gate that only comes up to about your waist. Odder
still is the fact that there's no door on the gate, just two metal sides
250448: You see a rather small, thin slot that seems to be almost cut into one
of the metal sides of the gate.
250504: A pair of large metal train tracks.
250524: A helpful subway worker says "Hey pal, get outa there!"
250560: A helpful subway worker says "Hey pal, get outa there!"
250596: A helpful subway worker says "Hey pal, get outa there!"
250632: A helpful subway worker says "Hey pal, get outa there!"
250668: A helpful subway worker says "Hey pal, get outa there!"
250704: A helpful subway worker says "Hey pal, get outa there!"
250740: A helpful subway worker says "Hey pal, get outa there!"
250776: A helpful subway worker says "Hey pal, get outa there!"
250812: A helpful subway worker says "Hey pal, get outa there!"
250848: A helpful subway worker says "Hey pal, get outa there!"
250884: A helpful subway worker says "Hey pal, get outa there!"
250920: You are in an underground train car. Various people fill the train,
some in uncomfortable-looking seats.
250980: There seem to be a few seats that haven't been taken.
251012: You are in an underground train car. Various people fill the train,
some in uncomfortable-looking seats.
251072: You are in an underground train car. Various people fill the train,
some in uncomfortable-looking seats.
251132: It looks like a smooth metal fence.
251156: A thug, clearly. Some scrapper with an attitude, and the desire to use
it.
251204: A young yupple, immaculately dressed in a pinstripe three-piece suit
and tie.
251260: Standing on a tall pole next to the stairs is a circular sign.
251300: The sign reads "GUS", and has an arrow pointing down.
251336: "The Great Underground Subway"

            Adventurers who really need
to get where they're going in a hurry are going to love GUS! The new
underground high-speed rail system can be your personal ride to the major
travel points in Quendor, for just one mere zorkmid! For Eastland travel to
Frostham, Aragain and Fublio Valley, the Purple line is at your service! For
Westland travel to New Borphee, Gurth City and Miznia, just jump on board the
Green line! And for you folks who need to get across the Great Sea in a hurry,
don't forget the Orange line, stopping off at Aragain, Anthar and Gurth City!
Remember, there's no costs for transferring between lines either. So don't
delay, take the GUS today!
251788: There's a discarded newspaper in a seat nearby.
251816: A copy of "The Fublio Tribune", with news, sports and feature sections
to read about.
251876: You are in the Entrance Foyer of a small but tasteful home. The exit is
to the southwest. The general area is tastefully done in maroon carpeting and
brass fixtures. Another room lies to the north.
251988: You are in a very decorative parlor. Various furnishings of high
quality are arranged around an enormous rug with intricate golden symbols in
the weave design. Open doorways lead south, north, east and west.
252112: A large potted plant sits in one corner.
252140: A well-tended house-plant.
252160: A large room here apparently serves as a lounge for entertaining. The
walls and furniture all have interesting design work that gives an impression
of dignified age. A doorway heads east.
252272: This is a study room with fancy wood paneling and plush carpeting.
There is an exit to the west.
252328: A large bookshelf takes up most of the north wall.
252360: It's filled with odds and ends, mostly uninteresting.
252394: This is a short journal of notes that Frobar was keeping. The contents
are quite dull, mostly consisting of entries like "Remember to water plant" and
so forth. In fact, the only non-trivial entry follows:

"Perhaps today I will
go visit Barsap's latest creation. Then again, maybe I won't. This so-called
'Gambit' of his is supposed to be some silly diversion where people can hop
around floating platforms trying to reach the southeast corner platform on the
bottom level, just so they can get teleported back to the top, and start all
over again! Can this be a monetarily beneficial thing? I doubt it."
252772: "...understand. I, like many of the Order, have understood that the
greatest Saints of our Order were the Three, those Three that we know as the
Ancient Ones. Why then, do I find in ancient cairns, in hidden temples, and in
versions of the Scriptures found in unsettled lands, that _four_ beings that
called themselves the Ancient Ones did do battle with evil and were defeated?
This surely is not to be believed, but I..."
253032: A massive wood desk carved from a single block of wood.
253068: A nice cozy bedroom. The exit is south.
253092: A large comfortable-looking bed.
253116: An enormous spiral staircase seems to wind miles above your head in
this curious column-like chamber. Strange points of light brighten the chamber
from above. To the west is a small exit.
253228: You can't go that way.
253240: This must be an apartment or penthouse in the skyscraper. You are in a
very high hall, with black slate stone walls that seem to reflect shadows
everywhere. There is a room to the north. The southern edge of this room drops
off into the darkness, followed by a long spiral staircase. The ceiling
overhead seems to have tiny points of light like a night sky.
253448: This is an exceptionally grand entrance foyer, with sweeping arched
ceilings and sparkling chandeliers. The room is dimly lit. Open hallways lead
south and west.
253544: A tastefully overdone lounge with tapestries and gold enamel finished
walls. The room is dimly lit, although you see no windows or other sources of
light. Open hallways lead east and west.
253660: There's an open journal sitting here.
253682: This appears to be a short collection of notes:

"TIPS ON CRACKING THE
NEW FROBOZZCO 3-DIAL COMBO LOCKS: 
Remember, there's a slight flaw in the
design. For every correct number in the correct dial, pressing the opening
button with cause a small click. Dials with the correct number in the wrong
dial place will cause a small thunk. The lock mechanism scans for correct
numbers in correct places first, and then for correct numbers in the wrong
place in the 'remaining dials'. Simple! But don't forget, closing the locks
will automatically lock and reset the dials!

NEW FLATHEAD PAINTING: 
I've
completed making the copy of the new Leonardo Flathead painting, received
courtesy of the Royal Museum. Glad to say my skills in art forgery are
undiminished -- I can barely tell the difference between the two myself! I'll
soon replace the original with the copy, and no one will be the wiser!"
254268: Piles of rare gemstones, precious jewelry, priceless artifacts, and
other treasures line the walls here.
254336: A large pile of fettucini dripping in carbonari sauce.
254396: It's a beautiful oil painting of a dark stormy scene. On the horizon,
you can see the edges of mountaintops. Near the top of the painting, two winged
figures are carrying a lone individual towards a break in the clouds, where a
bright white light seems to emanate.
254544: Standing on a featureless gray plane that stretches to the infinite
horizon against a gray sky, you can only conclude one thing -- you're on the
Ethereal Plane of Atrii. Well, at least it fits the description Brother Palemon
gave you. It seems like you could go in any direction from here.
254716: An invisible force blocks your way!
254740: Flat, featureless gray is in every direction you look. Stranger still
is the upright rectangular hole in the fabric of space that stands in the
center of this area. Otherwise, you could wander this gray dimension in any
direction, it seems.
254876: An invisible force blocks your way!
254900: Surely you are in a place where the very laws of nature and the Gods
work by different rules! Here stands a rectangular hole, seemingly torn out of
the very space you stand in. You see some curious metal chamber through the
opening, but there is nothing behind the opening.
255052: Flat, featureless gray is in every direction you look. Stranger still
is the flat, glass-like square in the center of the 'floor' of this area.
Otherwise, you could wander this gray dimension in any direction, it seems.
255180: An invisible force blocks your way!
255204: It looks and feels like a perfect square of ice, flush with the
featureless gray surface you stand on.
255264: Flat, featureless gray is in every direction you look. Stranger still
is the large black hole to the south. Otherwise, you could wander this gray
dimension in any direction, it seems.
255372: An invisible force blocks your way!
255396: It looks like a large hole, probably twice your height. It's completely
black and featureless.
255460: You're in a large dark tunnel that seems to run north and south. To the
south you see light. There seem to be two metal tracks running along the
ground.
255540: You walk north, and run into a invisible force!
255568: Two long metal tracks, running north and south. There's something oddly
familiar about them.
255624: Flat, featureless gray is in every direction you look. It seems like
you could go in any direction from here.
255688: An invisible force blocks your way!
255712: "...now know that the Rod we believe is the Rod of the Ancients,
sequestered in our Monastery, is an artifact of evil! Imprisoned inside, true
to the scriptures (at least this much is, what isn't, I can nowadays say is
much) we know, is Anabais. What is worse, is that this very Rod is an artifact
of evil power created by Anabais, in the image of the True Rod of the Ancients,
which he planned to use to aid him in his evil gains! Were that evil one free
again, and had about him both his brothers and his Rod of Evil, we would
witness a reckoning greater than Quendor has ever known! I take relief in the
knowledge that he will never be freed, and he will never regain his implement
of evil; only an innocent being can break the false rod and free him from his
prison, and subsequently, the false rod cannot be regained by Anabais through
his own will, or another evil being. In fact, only a being of good again can
gather the resulting pieces, and only through this being can Anabais regain his
evil artifact, for..."
256332: Flat, featureless gray is in every direction you look. It seems like
you could go in any direction from here.
256396: An invisible force blocks your way!
256420: Flat, featureless gray is in every direction you look. Stranger still
is the odd-shaped depression in the gray plane here. Otherwise, you could
wander this gray dimension in any direction, it seems.
256540: An invisible force blocks your way!
256564: It's a large elongated depression in the gray 'floor'. The cavity has a
flat bottom, and somewhat cigar-like shape.
256636: Flat, featureless gray is in every direction you look. Directly
overhead, you notice odd streaks of light. From here, you could wander this
gray dimension in any direction, it seems.
256748: An invisible force blocks your way!
256772: Some heavy-cloth curtains along the south wall.
256800: A room that could be a kitchen, if it didn't seem completely strange.
Harsh bright lights seem to be coming from some unknown source. Strange-looking
white countertops and cabinets fill the area, along with a curious white
closet-like object. A room lies to the west.
256956: A white plastic device that seems to encase a glass pitcher or kettle
of some sort. Most odd.
257016: A very curious small bedroom. A white desk sits here amongst other odd
furnishings.
257072: A white desk, with a strange, modern look.
257100: A plain-looking door. A note attached to it says "DO NOT DISTURB,
IMPLEMENTOR AT WORK".
257180: You've entered a wondrous natural cave, lit everywhere by reflected
light from some sort of purple crystalline substance in the walls. A tunnel
exits to the northwest.
257280: There's a purple crystal sphere partially embedded in the rock floor
here.
257324: A large purple sphere that seems to pulse with strange energy.
257360: Lying in one corner of the room is a skeleton.
257388: Just some bones, not much else, is all.
258192: You find yourself in a huge cavern. To the west is a large exit that
looks out into a void of snow-covered mountains.
258260: You hesitate. The cave seems to just exit off the side of a mountain,
and all you can see below is whiteness. It could be a long way down.
258340: You are on a long open boat, riding the waves of some great sea. The
boat seems to be filled with sailors from some militia.
258404: A bunch of dour-looking navy sailors.
258428: Nothingness surrounds you. Yet, you feel like your conscious being
extends into worlds and dimensions never imagined. You float in a void of total
being.
258516: The absence of anything. Yet, at the same time, the sense that
everything possible is near.
258568: You stand on a single giant floating white cube, in the middle of some
dimly lit cavern. 

A small newt floats nearby, concentrating on
something.

The newt suddenly opens its eyes! "What?" it croaks in surprise.
"Who are you? You've broken my concentration on the spell, you fool!" the newt
croaks. You feel the cube shift, then stop floating! You plummet into the lava
you feared was below...
258802: You are on top of a pyramid in some ancient city. You see dense jungle
to the horizon. An ancient civilization spreads before you, in all its
mysterious glory.

Several robed figures surround you.

Suddenly, you realize
you are tightly bound! One of the figures points towards the horizon and makes
a complicated gesture. In a language you do not understand, he seems to make a
prayer to some nameless god! Fearing the inevitable, you struggle mightily, but
to no avail. In moments, the group of robed figures hurls you off the pyramid
to your death!
259132: A giant white dragon, the size of a small house.
259164: A rough-looking navy captain.
259184: A black sphere of energy.
259204: A smoke-filled sphere of energy.
259228: A gray sphere of energy.
259244: A white sphere of energy.
259264: A somewhat battered brown-leather briefcase.
259292: It looks like a large, slightly convex round disc made of some silvery
material.
259340: A strange short section of rod colored silver.
259368: A strange short section of rod colored red.
259396: A strange short section of rod colored green.
259424: A strange short section of rod colored brown.
259452: You are floating in an empty space. Surrounding you on all sides is a
great wall of flame. It would almost seem like you are trapped inside a ball of
fire.
259536: You are floating in an empty space. Surrounding you on all sides is a
great wall of flame. It would almost seem like you are trapped inside a ball of
fire.
259620: It's rather hypnotic -- a perfect sphere made entirely of orange-red
fire.
259672: It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
