13870: The game file has verified as intact.

perform the test).

16980: is now in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gives long
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
17082: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).

of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
17644: But it's dark.
17661: You find nothing of interest.
17697: But it's dark.
17788: You find nothing of interest.
18958: . Not bad.
18976: That was a rhetorical question.
19003: This dangerous act would achieve little.
19037: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
19073: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
19110: That seems unnecessary.
19133: Keep your mind on the game.
19158: What a good idea.
19177: You smell nothing unexpected.
19204: You hear nothing unexpected.
19229: You taste nothing unexpected.
19264: Keep your hands to yourself!
19289: You feel nothing unexpected.
19314: If you think that'll help.
19340: Digging would achieve nothing here.
19407: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
19440: You would achieve nothing by this.
19469: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
19502: But there's no water here to carry.
19533: Oh, don't apologise.
19555: Real adventurers do not use such language.
19590: Quite.
19601: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
19634: There's not enough water to swim in.
19665: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
19729: You achieve nothing by this.
19817: You wave, feeling foolish.
19967: You are unable to.
19986: Nothing obvious happens.
20009: That would be less than courteous.
20047: Is that the best you can think of?
20076: That's not a direction.
20099: Not that way you can't.
20131: Keep your hands to yourself.
20156: You achieve nothing by this.
20190: Futile.
20202: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
20254: You talk to yourself a while.
20281: This provokes no reaction.
20309: There is no reply.
20328: Nothing is on sale.
20347: Your singing is abominable.
20373: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
20410: Time passes.
20425: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
42734: Fool.
42742: Hands to yourself, buddy.
42778: What was it like back then?
42815: What are you, three months old?
42844: It doesn't look hungry.
42914: The world waits while you ruminate about your place within it.
42967: I believe kitty needs a breath mint first.
43003: Better not, he'd scratch your face off.
43048: You scratch under his chin, as he strains against you.
43087: You bend down to pet him, but he deftly evades your advances.
43140: The cat grumbles a bit as you hoist him up.
43176: Methinks there's more to this than that.
43212: The cat hisses and begins to flip out, so you decide against it.
43267: Words cannot describe the relief that the cat shows while being
released.
43527: The cat scratches at the door.
43580: i.
The cat lumbers into the room, then sighs heavily as he notices you.
43636: The cat saunters up next to you, as if to say, "I'm here now.  Go away."
43719: The cat makes his way down the stairway to the northeast.
43779: The cat scrambles up the stairway to the southwest.
43955: The cat looks around curiously, and sniffs the room for a bit before
spotting the glorious lump of cow parts you have so generously left for him. 
For a moment, you can see a glint of appreciation in his eyes as he devours the
treat. Then you remember he's got a respiratory infection which makes his eyes
perpetually runny.
44207: The cat goes over to the empty bowl, looks over it mournfully, then
turns and hisses at you.  What a lovely relationship.
44331: It only works once, doofus.
44361: A magic cheeseburger appears on it!
44397: The cat food bowl sits in the corner, wielding a lump of cat "food"
menacingly.
44459: There is an empty cat food bowl on the floor in the corner. Bits of old,
decaying, dried-up cat food speckle the rim.
44608: Or something.
44692: I'd leave the bowl there.
44729: Give the cat some sense of stability in his life.
44799: . system... "The cat food bowl is for cat food loading and unloading
only."
44871: You attempt to open the can telepathically from across the room, to no
avail.
44935: Your fingers pry at the lid, but it's most securely attached.
44999: I believe there are tools specialized for this sort of thing.
45057: You go get the glue and I'll just wait here.
45108: You'd rather not have to clean that up.
45144: Do you see a problem with this?
45182: Probably not a good idea.
45211: You deftly open the can with your trusty can opener, revealing some
really frightening cat food.
45289: It's bad enough to have to smell it, you don't want it on your fingers.
45402: The cat food slowly slides out of the can and into the bowl, making
quite the grotesque slurping sound all the way.
45483: Amazingly, you managed to get all the food into the bowl the first time.
45534: Put the what into the what, now?
45571: It's too unwieldy to carry while open.
45614: It's too hard to open while you're carrying it.
45725: There's no room, what with all that...stuff in there.
45906: There's just too much...STUFF.
45940: Hmmm... [shuffle, clank, rip] ...
46008: That's sure to be helpful, eh?
46052: Your very favorite plastic flashlight!
46099: You discovered you have way too much useless garbage.
46183: Fool.
46199: Your car keys dangle from the ignition.
46270: You'll have to turn the car off.
46318: The beam bursts forth from the flashlight, and momentarily grazes what
appears to be some sort of light switch on the wall.
46482: i'm guessing "on" and "off".
46742: You brave your way down the steps, gripping the handrail tight.
46869: You need to get out of here...fast.
47081: You might want to close the door, first, lest you fall out.
47146: You drive...
47159: Driving there would have to be considered stupid beyond belief.
47208: You put the pedal to the metal, and turn the steering wheel left and
right, yet the car fails to move, since it's not currently running.
47316: Hard to do that from the outside.
47346: The engine lets forth a horrible scraping sound as you try to turn it on
when it's already on.
47417: Hotwiring just ain't your style.
47551: Meowmeister doesn't like vehicles.
47586: Who are you, Lou Ferigno?
47618: You fire up its willing engine, responding with a roar.
47670: The engine sputters a few times and falls silent.
47730: By the way, your car was just stolen.  Probably shouldn't have left it
running.
47811: After spending several hours at your local watering hole, you come home
refreshed and relaxed.  That is, until you notice that you left your front door
open, and your cat has run away, and everything you own (which, admittedly, was
not much, but it was all you had) has been stolen.

After a few moments of
fervent introspection, you go down to your local pawnshop, trade your car in
for a gun, and blow your head off, right there in the store.

The last sight
you see, as your lifeblood spills over onto the pawn shop floor, is the
pawnshop owner grabbing a mop.
48224: As you head off into the distance, you see a large ball of fur in your
rearview mirror running out of the parking lot, and trying to follow you.  Its
progress is slowed, however, by a large van which is not able to stop in time,
and does unpleasant things to the skeletal structure of whatever animal it
was.

That's when it dawns on you that you left your cat outside.

Not able to
live with the guilt of your cat's untimely demise, you jump out of your moving
car into the middle of the road.

The van doesn't stop in time for you either.
48616: After swimming in the ocean for what seemed like an eternity, you come
home, happy, renewed, and ready to face the world.  What you weren't quite
ready to face was the sight of your cat lying dead in the kitchen, with his
food bowl next to him, severely scratched and dented from his futile attempts
to get nourishment from the plastic.  Starvation had finally taken its toll. 
After realizing that you really did love that cat, and he was basically the
only thing left in your life that you cared about, you head right back outside
and throw yourself over the railing of the walkway, head-first into the
pavement below.

It gets messy from there.
49068: You head off to the bowling alley for a few hours of relaxing pin abuse.
 While you're bowling, a gorgeous blonde supermodel notices your superb form. 
You get to talking, and it turns out that she just broke up with her
international-airline-pilot boyfriend, and is looking for more of a regular
type of guy, with a regular old apartment, and a regular old car.  And a cat. 
She loves cats.

You make plans to meet up later at a restaurant.  You begin
your drive home, walking on air, and smiling wider than you've ever before had
reason to.

As your mind goes over every inch of this goddess you've just met,
you go right through a red light.

A car hits you dead-on from the driver's
side, killing you instantly.

But at least you died happy!
49627: As we sew the tapestry of our lives, we work with only one thread at a
time.  Some are bright, some dark, some with colors we can't quite
describe.

At the moment, you are working with one particularly dull, frayed
thread, and one sorry excuse for a needle.  The events of the past year are
immaterial right now.  All you know is that "home" is not what it used to mean,
and this is not where you want to be.

If you could just get away... even for
an hour or two.
52106: You can't see a damn thing.
52280: Score:
52288: Moves:
52296: Time:
52304: You can't go that way.
52434: e09.  Its true symbolic magnificence is once again belied by its current
squalid nature.  You wonder for a while how anyone could actually live in a
place like this, until you remember that you pay the rent here.  The endless
white of the undecorated walls is interrupted only by a hallway to the south,
the kitchen to the east, and the front door to the north.
52684: He appears to be quite hungry, and not at all pleased with you.
52728: A large, selfish cat stares at you impatiently.
52764: He no longer seems hungry, but you can still tell he hates your guts.
52812: The door has seen better days, but it serves as an acceptable obstacle
between your apartment and the rest of the universe.
52896: The front door swings wide, clinging to squeaky hinges.
52936: The front door is closed, displaying its chipped, off-white countenance
with pride.
52996: Looks pretty boring to me, eh?
53020: Oooh, it's got a big magic cheeseburger on it.
53208: The living room is painfully visible to the west.
53272: What will they think of next?
53296: New "18 Lives", for the schizophrenic cat.
53336: It looks and smells a lot like cat food.
53504: a passage to the north leads into what would be called a "living" room,
if you had a life, and your walk-in closet is to the west.
53672: Just lots of little odds and ends.
53776: It will go unfulfilled, however, since all you have is old torn apparel
not even worthy of being folded.
54034: But then you remember to read the note from the author again.
54076: As one might expect, it's furnished with an on/off switch.
54120: It appears to be a standard light switch.
54152: A light switch adorns the wall of the closet.
54248: Gee, I wonder what it does.
54436: Down a rather shaky flight of stairs to the northeast, the parking lot
beckons, while the door back into the apartment <shudder> is south.
54536: They're worn down, like the rest of this place.
54966: The stairway leading up to the southwest seems to serve only as a
conduit between your cages of anguish.
55044: Your shiny blue car sits here idling, wasting valuable natural
resources.
55096: Your shiny blue car sits here silently.
55222: What?
55298: The note reads...

Hi.  Welcome to my "game", which exists solely to
help me learn the Inform language.  I apologize if you thought this was going
to be a real game.
