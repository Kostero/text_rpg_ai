claws at your mind.
53284: You hear only the sound of your own breathing and the sighing of the
wind.
53336: Perhaps it is a bit too late in the day to get religion.
53376: You hear the crackling of the fire.

53436: You hear only the sound of your own breathing and the sighing of the
wind.
53488: You hear only the sound of your own breathing.
53548: A crackling fire fills Professor Wilkens' panelled study with shadows
which leap and shift, giving you the unpleasant, but absurd, sensation of
furtive things moving just beyond the edges of your vision.
53692: An open desk sits against one wall. A single window looks out onto the
night. The study door is to the east.
53768: A closed desk sits against one wall. A single window looks out onto the
night. The study door is to the east.
53846: Professor Wilkens returns with a new bottle of his fine scotch.
53898: You attempt to conceal the map you're holding. Too late.

Wilkens merely
gives you a thin smile. "You're  a better journalist than you are a thief.
Bloody good job too."
54024: You're no longer certain that driving out into the fens was a good idea.
The cold, and damp and fog seems almost to have got into your soul.
54122: It was with some difficulty that you retraced the route Wilkens had
lightly pencilled on the map in a shaky hand. Each village you drove through
seemed more devoid of life than the previous. Probably just because  it was
late and the wind was getting up.  After a few wrong turns you  arrived here,
at twilight. Standing in front of your now securely locked van, you are aware
of the cold. Why you  suddenly felt impelled to lock the van in this
unpopulated spot you cannot say.
54456: On this cold and snowy night you would rather stay and sample
Wilkens'excellent single malt scotch.
54528: On this cold and snowy night you would rather stay and sample
Wilkens'excellent single malt scotch.
54600: Wilkens smiles ruefully. "A bit old to play the class dunce aren't you,
Lawrence?"
54664: On this cold and snowy night you would rather stay and sample
Wilkens'excellent single malt scotch.
54934: augustine of Hippo, the tongs Saint Dunstan used to grab the Devil's
nose. Your friend appears more gaunt than when you last saw him. Perhaps it is
the harsh firelight.
55054: You remark on the snowy weather.

Wilkens sighs, as if you were a slow
student. "I can't say I'm in the mood for chat, Lawrence. I expected you would
ask me about that thorn or the abbey or theology or even my scotch. Most times
you visit it's 'ask wilkens about this -- ask wilkens about that.' Those
journalistic tendencies of yours. Now I'm rather sorry I mentioned those
subjects. I expect it was the scotch."
55510: I can't vouch for the supernatural properties of the Glastonbury Thorn
myself, but I have seen one very like, located near a ruined abbey in the Fens.
I wouldn't look at that thorn bush again for anything in the world. I wouldn't
look at the abbey again as far as that goes."
55706: This ruined priory was in the fens, a few miles south of a village
modern map makers have apparently given up for dead. I tracked down the
location through Ordnance Survey maps and correspondence with several vicars in
the surrounding country. I would not give you directions  any sooner than I
would give you directions to your own grave. 

"I know your journalistic
nature, Lawrence. I hope you're not thinking of going out there. Just drink
your scotch and forget I mentioned it."

It seems to you that Wilkens glances,
reflexively, toward the closed desk.
56104: Wilkens stares into his tumbler. "Laphroaig. From Islay. Fifteen years
old I was working on that monograph about the Virgin's Girdle when this was
vatted."
56326: "You want to talk religion? You surprise me, Lawrence. I fear you picked
a bad time, however. I am re-evaluating my beliefs."
56424: "You're the journalist, Lawrence. Surely you know more about this town
than I do."
56488: "It reminds me too much of the evening I visited that ruined abbey in
the fens."
56548: "This will be a beastly night there. I would prefer not to think about
the fens. That abbey was in the fens."
56630: "Joseph of Arimathea? He supplied Christ's burial shroud, according to
the Bible."
56698: "Do we even know our own beliefs?"
56728: "I would have told you he was as real as Father Christmas. Now I'm not
so sure."
56792: Wilkens chuckles. "No, Lawrence.  You won't get directions out of me.
You don't want them either."

It is hard to be sure in the flickering
firelight, but it seems to you that his gaze shifts momentarily toward the
desk.
56954: I'm not sure I know myself any more.
56986: Wilkens gives that faint, pained smile which, you know, means the
question doesn't interest him.
57058: "Would you care to try the Lagavulin?" Wilkens says suddenly. "I have a
bottle of that out in the kitchen."

You watch as Wilkens walks out the door.
You hear his footsteps going down the hall.
57204: Wilkens shifts in his chair and looks out the window.
57242: Wilkens stares down into his tumbler.
57272: Wilkens gazes off into the shadows as if deep in thought.
57314: Wilkens swirls the scotch around in his tumbler.
57352: Wilkens appears to study the flames in the fire.
57388: Beyond the window a fine veil of snow catches the lights of Oxford and
casts upon the February garden a pallid glow that might be mistaken for
twilight except for the late hour.
57512: Nothing more than shadows -- always an excellent canvas for the
imagination.
57568: Both the chairs in the small study are covered in leather, which is
about all you notice, not being especially keen on interior decoration.
57664: An old fashioned roll top desk of polished oak.
57700: Wilkens frowns. "Really, Lawrence. I know you Fleet Street fellows have
a reputation for snooping but you can stay out of my desk. Nothing in there to
interest The Sun anyway."
57828: Feeling like a schoolboy risking a caning you place a hand on Professor
Wilkens' desk.
57892: You don't have time to play with Wilkens' desk.
57928: An ordnance survey map. Apparently an area of the fens. Someone has
marked a cross near a minor road far from any villages. Does it perhaps tell
you how to find the abbey Wilkens warned you about?

Of course, the initial
step on that journey is to go through the door to the east before Wilkens
returns.
58140: You feel, suddenly, that you shouldn't put anything but wood into the
fireplace.
58200: If you stare into the flames long enough you discern dark patches which
will not quite form coherent shapes.
58276: The scotch in the tumbler is the gold of distilled firelight.
58320: As you take a sip from the tumbler you feel a warmth in the back of your
throat matching the warmth radiated by the fire.
58404: A faint smokey odor. You might almost say the smell of burnt peat,
although that is probaly just your imagination.
58512: Better yet, drink it.
58602: Snow covers the ground but mists still hang above the ditches which take
the place of hedgerows in the area. To the east, a stone vicarage and church
are outlined against the sky.
58726: You have the feeling you're being watched.
58760: You seem to hear a footstep. Turning, you see nothing.
58802: You catch a movement from the corner of your eye. Or was it just your
imagination?
58864: The fens do not appear inviting, frigid and wrapped in mist.
58908: A no-nonsense vehicle. The van suits you. But it has seen better days.
Even the Grateful Dead decals in the back window are peeling. No use worrying
about your transportation. You're not leaving yet.
59052: A light coating of snow, almost as if the mist shrouding the fens had
crystallized and settled out of the air.
59128: Like icy dust, it melts away at your touch.
59160: Mists lie across the flat landscape like fallen clouds.
59316: But you are not going back there yet.
59448: rock pile. No light shows through the one window that is unshuttered.
Despite the cold, not a breath of smoke rises from the chimney.
59544: A plain rectangular Saxon structure, with a squat tower. It displays no
lights or other signs of life.
59814: rectangular mass from here. A churchyard lies to the north.
59890: There is no answer.
59940: The fens do not appear inviting, frigid and wrapped in mist.
59984: No one has bothered to sweep the snow from the stones, some of which
have been revealed by the wind.
60056: The vicarage, even up close, resembles little more than a dark ruin,
albeit a ruin which is still standing, shutters secured, door shut.
60152: From here you can make out only a few shadowy gravestones.
60214: he fading twilight turns the single unshuttered window into a gray
rectangle, but seems hardly strong enough to penetrate the glass. Where the
south wall must be there is a black gap you guess is a fireplace.
60356: The flames in the fireplace send shadows slithering along the walls. You
see now that the room is utterly bare, devoid of a single stick of furniture.
60540: In moments firelight has pushed the night into the corners of the room.
60592: You can't face the cold again now the fire is lit.
60628: There seems to be no way out of this room except for the door leading
outside.
60684: Dry sticks. Little more than kindling wood.
60716: On the ground beneath the brush lie some dry sticks.
60836: In moments firelight has pushed the night into the corners of the room.
60888: Just a gray oblong, like a patch of glowing mist.
60924: Orange firelight wavers on the old bubbled glass. Nothing outside is
visible.
60980: There is no fire. The fireplace is little more than a dark cavity in the
wall. It contains not a single stick of wood.
61064: The flames leap and dissipate. It is hard to discern their boundary.
61112: Little more than a dark cavity in the wall. It contains not a single
stick of wood.
61172: Flames leap and dissipate. It is hard to discern their boundary.
61220: Weak light from the gray rectangle of the door to the west and from the
tall, pointed windows along the walls, reveal a gutted interior. A stone
staircase leads up into the tower.
61344: If there is another door, you don't care to search for it in the
darkness.
61396: Veiled with dust they reveal nothing of the world beyond.
61436: The tower is an empty shell, like the rest of the church, dimly
illuminated by the twilight beyond the single window.
61520: The stairway down is the only way out of this dusty freezing box.
61568: Through the window you can see the unworldly mist wreathed fens. Your
van, beside the road, reminds you of a spacecraft arrived at some alien planet.
62038: one night a monk whose name has been lost, or purposefully obliterated, 
slashed a cutting from the thorn and he and a few disciples fled to the Fens.
Like the Cistercians, they preferred  a wild country where they would be
allowed to worship in their chosen manner. The cutting grew where it was
planted, and where it was planted the monks built an abbey. But the
supernatural properties of this thorn were different from those of the
Glastonbury Thorn."

There is nothing more. Either the story was never
continued or was discarded.
62412: In one dusty corner lies a book. It leans half open against the wall,
almost as if it had been thrown there.
62488: A pale wisp of motion catches your attention. A figure appears, seeming
almost to coalesce from the shadows as it approaches.

"I am the Reverend
Owen," comes the soft voice, sounding distant even though the speaker is right
beside you. "You must come into the vicarage. It is too cold to talk here. You
will want to ask me about the thorn."

[Press any key to follow vicar]
62762: Inside seems colder than outside.

"Why don't you make a fire." The
Vicar nods toward the fireplace. "I believe there are still a few warm embers
lurking under the ashes.  Some wood is all that's needed. Then you can ask what
you want to know.
62944: You feel, suddenly, that you shouldn't put the book into the fireplace.
62996: The dark, worn stones lead steeply upwards into the church tower.
63042: As you enter the churchyard, you are uncomfortably aware of the failing
light. Across the road, the snow covered Fens retain a dull, metallic sheen,
but objects nearer - the vicarage, the gravestones  in the churchyard - are
already growing indistinct.
63356: extends to the north. The church looms to the east.
63392: You do not care to wander out into the chill and misty fens.
63436: A wrought iron fence. The spiked ends of the pales are almost level with
your eyes. There are gaps where the fence has fallen.
63524: So cold the sensation is more like burning.
63556: Their markings are eroded and unreadable. The carved names of the
deceased survived their corporeal existence, but are vanished now as well.
63656: Cold. You can barely feel slight indentations that must once have been
names and dates.
63720: A plain wooden door.
63736: You hear the snow crunch underfoot as you walk further into the
churchyard. Suddenly a figure appears from the darkness. Then, from the corner
of your eye, you see another...and another. In an instant you realize you are
surrounded, not by phantoms, but cross-shaped monuments.
63958: you are surrounded, not by phantoms, but cross-shaped monuments. To the
west, in the growing shadows, you can make out what might be a ruin. The
churchyard extends to the south.
64084: You'd soon find yourself lost in the fens.
64116: You can make out only a shadowy mass from here.
64152: Eroded cross-shaped monuments, arms outflung, like stolid scarecrows or
the grotesquely frozen ghosts of the departed.
64236: You feel rough stone, rough lichen.
64264: The remains of an ancient abbey. Is this in fact the abbey Wilkens
warned you about?
64534: The churchyard lies to the east.
64560: You do not care to wander out into the chill and misty fens.
64668: to build the later church and vicarage, as usual. The remaining wall
might have been part of the frater.
64744: Some half dead brush.
64760: On the ground beneath you see some dry sticks.
64792: The ruined wall crumbles toward the end into broken rock and masonry. It
must have been lying here for centuries. All that remains are those pieces, too
damaged or irregular to have been of any use to anyone.
64936: So brown and dessicated it is hard to belief they were ever alive.
65082: trash is piled along the wall. Just beyond, growing from weeds and
rubble at the wall's end is a deformed and stunted looking thorn bush. The ruin
extends back to the east.
65204: The fens do not appear inviting, frigid and wrapped in mist.
65424: Sharp crystals of snow blow against your face. Then something touches
your leg. A barely perceptible touch -  like stiff fingers - or a frozen
branch.

You look at the bush again. It is motionless, unaffected by the
movement of the air around it. You are at least half a meter from any of the
branches.
65640: You begin to reach out but something stops you. A sudden revulsion. The
thought of touching the grotesque black bush makes you shudder.
65822: plaster wall a ghostly cross shape shows where a crucifix had protected
the plaster beneath from smoke. The only way out is the door to the west.
66048: The ashes in the fireplace are cold.
66076: A slightly stooped man of average height. His plain black suit fades
into the dark and his features are lost in shadow. You can make out his
clerical collar, however, glowing palely.
66204: The vicar's face is gaunt, his skin pale as the marble of a tomb. His
eyes reflect the blaze in the fireplace.
66282: You mutter something about the cold weather.

The vicar merely shakes
his head. "You haven't sought me out to talk about the weather. Surely there
are things you want to ask me about. Things you have seen this evening."
66566: You only need some wood."
66586: "The bush you were looking at just now really did grow from a cutting
from the sacred thorn at Glastonbury. But it did not have the
same...properties. It was cursed.

Maybe it was because the monks who brought
it here held different beliefs, or God had just changed his mind. The bush
budded, but the buds, few in number, never opened - - until one of the monks
died."

There was no predicting when those buds would open, not the season or
the year. Why should their presence have been so profoundly disturbing when we
are all waiting to die?
66974: "The ruined abbey dates to an ancient time, before even King Lucius, who
was our first Christian King.. The church and vicarage were built after the
abbey had fallen into ruin or been demolished. The villagers used stones
scavenged from the ruins. A common practice. At any rate, I believe those
stones were imbued with a curse --  by the supernatural thorn whose roots
spread beneath them -- and they carry that curse even today." 

The vicar
sighs. Very faintly. You cannot even see the misty exhalation of his breath
although your own breath forms clouds in the still frosty air inside the
vicarage. "When you step into the church or the vicarage you might as well be
stepping into that accursed abbey."
67472: "I thought I had destroyed those notes. They were written when I was
ill. There are things that should not be set down for posterity. Or so I have
come to believe."
67690: without power. There are things as ancient which still live."
67736: The vicar pauses for a long time before answering. When he speaks his
voice sounds strained. "Ah...our saviour. Now there is one, at least, who
should be certain in his beliefs. And not only certain but correct. Yet, on the
cross, did he not cry out asking why God had forsaken him?"
67940: "Once I thought myself on speaking terms with God. I was a foolish young
man."
68000: "People speak so easily of beliefs But how well do any of us know even
our own beliefs? What choices we will actually make, when the time comes?"
68104: Joseph of Arimathea was a good Christian, by all accounts. The thorn
that grew from his staff was a miracle. It was this other thorn, the thorn of
the heretics, that was something less than miraculous.
68248: "Isn't it obvious what I am? A poor vicar. I do not like to talk about
myself."
68308: The vicar shrugs."Fire or ice. It is all the same to me, now."
68376: he looks as if his thoughts are far away. Clearly the subject does not
interest him.
68434: When Vicar Owen has finished speaking you feel a sudden overpowering
lethargy. He bids you to rest, so you lie down before the fire, not feeling it
strange to do so.

[Press Any Key to Dream]
68580: You sleep. In your nightmares you are drawn into a terrible geometry
outlined by the twisted black branches of the thorn. 

You seem to hear
Professor Wilkens speaking, can almost see him, sitting in his study, sipping
scotch. "You should never have taken that map, Lawrence. Since you have, you
may as well know the story. There was an Abbot Worgren, they say, who began a
painstaking study of the thorn. He recorded the appearance of each bud, when a
newcomer arrived at the abbey, and each bloom, when a soul departed.

 For
every soul who stayed in the abbey, there appeared a bud. It blossomed at his
death.

One summer, though he was still a young man, Worgren fell victim to one
of those fevers that haunted the marshes. Sick as he was, he made his daily
visit to the thorn. Then, on St. Luke's Day - ironic, since he is the patron
saint of physicians - it was reported to Worgren that the thorn bore a new bud
which was swelling.

The fever intensified, as if the fires of Hell burned
inside his skull.  By the next morning Worgren began to slip in and out of
delirium.  In a rational moment he ordered two monks to carry him to the thorn.
He feared the new, swelling bud marked his own his own life, and that, come
morning, it would burst into bloom at the first touch of the rising sun. Would
blossom into his own death.

Worgren had come prepared. He pulled from his
robes a knife from the refrectory. He slashed blindly at the limb his monks had
indicated. He did not look directly at the bud, because it is said that one who
looks too closely at his own mortality is thenceforth held in thrall.
Nevertheless, he loped the bud off, or so he believed.

[Press Any Key to

70270: You wake. Chilled to the bone. Not sure whether you have had a dream or
a vision."
70334: The vicar glances around nervously.
70362: The vicar shudders, as if from the cold.
70394: The vicar rubs his hands together..
70424: The vicar lets out a soft sigh..
70450: The vicar looks at you expectantly.
70478: The vicar frowns as if in thought.
70506: The vicar glances toward the fireplace.
70538: You are drawn irresistibly back to the ruined wall, the incongruous
trash heap, the weeds and rubble and the monstrously twisted thorn. The harsh
morning light reveals what gentle dusk did not. A white scar on one of the
twisted black branches, still covered in frozen sap. A cut was made, only
recently.

You would have thought a Vicar, a man who believes in God, would
trust in the promise of an afterlife.  Yet Owen had followed Worgren's lead and
cut the bud off to prevent his own death.

You were talking to a ghost. How
many ghosts wander the ruins. Monks who took the same course - who preferred
even a cold, phantom existence in a world they knew to a promised Kingdom of
God they weren't sure of.

The vicarage in which you spent the night was built
with stones from the accursed abbey. Have you, then, come under the sway of the
ancient curse?

One particular black, gnarled branch, seems almost to beckon
you, asking you to examine it. You know, somehow, that if you pause, if you
truly look upon what you fear is there, it will have you in its thrall. Yet,
you need to know.  Don't you? The way home is to the south.
71422: The way home is to the south.
71526: The way home is to the south.
71548: Just miscellaneous refuse. Probably the rubbish heap for the vicarage.
71600: A broken bottle thrusts its sharp, jaggedly broken neck up out of the
garbage.
71656: A broken scotch bottle. Laphroaig. What's left of the neck is like a
razor.
71712: A broken bottle thrusts its sharp, jaggedly broken neck up out of the
rubbish beside the wall.
71780: You see something you didn't notice before. A broken bottle thrusts its
sharp, jaggedly broken neck up out of the rubbish beside the wall.
71876: A broken bottle thrusts its sharp, jaggedly broken neck up out of the
rubbish beside the wall.
71944: What possible use could you have for a broken scotch bottle? What you
need is one that's full.
72012: Just miscellaneous refuse. Probably the rubbish heap for the vicarage.
72062: You see what you feared, on what had been the  bare branches of the
thorn, just below the cut made by the vicar, a thing you will never dare to
look at again, nor raise your hand against - a single bright green bud.

You
have chosen to look upon your own mortality.
72248: You slash at the swelling bud with the broken bottle. In your panic, you
misjudge, miss. You raise the bottle, gouge again, until there remains on the
branch only a bleeding white wound.

It seems you feel the cut yourself.  Not
pain, exactly. More a sense of separation. Something being severed.  A long way
off. Between you and heaven.

You have refused to accept your own mortality.
72528: What do you intend to cut the thorn with?
72558: Now you sit again in Wilkens' study.  Neither of you mention the thorn.
You will never return to that ruined abbey.

The fire in the hearth is ebbing.
The bottle of scotch is nearly empty. From outside comes the snow muffled sound
of the ringing of Christ Church bell.

You have chosen not to look upon your
own mortality.
72790: You cannot bring yourself to examine the accursed thorn. You return to
the van, drive back to Oxford. At some point, you crumple the map and throw it
into the fens.
72912: The scotch, the flickering dimness, the snow outside the window, combine
to put you in a reflective mood. You and Wilkens went to school together.
Perhaps you should have followed his course, moved into the cloistered halls
rather than Fleet Street. Would you be more suited to a reflective life, rather
than rushing about on story assignments, deadlines forever looming?
73172: "You've heard of the Holy Thorn of  Glastonbury?" Professor Wilkens
takes another sip of scotch and leans forward in his wing chair. He looks at
you expectantly, as if waiting for a show of hands. You know from experience he
will expect you to ask him about this proposed topic, this strange thorn.
73632: , I tried, so far as possible, to avoid Adrift's more advanced features
and so there is a minmal ALR file and a few elementary variables and
events.

The game was ported to Inform as a learning exercise. Be forewarned.


This game was inspired and entered in davidw's 2003 summer Adrift minicomp.
74056: That's not something you want to do.
74084: "Looking for a grade then Lawrence?" You can almost hear Wilkens' voice.
"How much is a soul worth?"
74236: What if that's all anything is?
74260: To talk ASK character ABOUT something.
