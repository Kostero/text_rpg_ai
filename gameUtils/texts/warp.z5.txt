34599: . Not too bad.
34617: Did you say something?
34666: No way.

34725: What a good idea.
34748: You smell nothing unexpected.
34835: You hear nothing unexpected.
34864: You pervert!

35012: Are you enjoying yourself?
35037: Do you expect me to applaud?
35092: Oh, forget it.
35118: It is, isn't it.
35245: You wave, feeling foolish.
35365: Nothing happens.
35400: Is that all you've got?
35423: That's not a direction.
35446: Not that way you can't.
35478: Keep your hands to yourself.
35503: How singularly useless.
35534: Futile.
35563: You talk to yourself a while.
35590: This provokes no reaction.
35618: There is no reply.
35637: Nothing is on sale.
35656: Your singing is abominable.

53572: Time:
53580: You can't go that way.
54092: You can only do that to a human or living creature.
54128: Try a verb that's in my vocabulary, lest I start being sarcastic.
54176: I know your waist line has a bigger number than your IQ, but even you
can do better than that.
54732: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
54764: What, are you going to pull your eyes out of their sockets?
55216: Try a verb that's in my vocabulary, lest I start being sarcastic.
55264: I know your waist line has a bigger number than your IQ, but even you
can do better than that.
55568: Do you really want to restart now?
55748: Sheesh!
55756: That idea isn't very practical, but it is amusing.
55792: You're carrying too many things already.
55824: You can't put something on top of itself.
55856: That idea isn't very practical, but it is amusing.
55892: That might have worked in Infocom games, but not here.
55932: That idea isn't very practical, but it is amusing.
55968: That would scarcely empty anything.
56024: You can only get into something freestanding.
56056: But you aren't in anything at the moment.
56088: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
56128: is now in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gives detailed
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
56228: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives detailed descriptions
of locations (even if you've been there before).
56316: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
56404: You can't see anything while it is dark.
56576: That idea isn't very practical, but it is amusing.
56612: That idea isn't very practical, but it is amusing.
56648: This dangerous act would achieve little.
56682: You're not going to get any help from higher powers here.
56724: You smell just like you always did.
56752: That seems rather rude, doesn't it?
56780: That idea isn't very practical, but it is amusing.
56816: That idea isn't very practical, but it is amusing.
56852: That idea isn't very practical, but it is amusing.
56888: That idea isn't very practical, but it is amusing.
56924: Very good. Now you can go to the second grade.
56960: You would achieve nothing by this.
56984: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
57012: But there's no water here to carry.
57062: Better yet, try some bleach.
57084: That idea isn't very practical, but it is amusing.
57120: That idea isn't very practical, but it is amusing.

57228: That idea isn't very practical, but it is amusing.
57264: Try as you might, you can't seem to do that.
57296: That would be less than courteous.
57320: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
57388: Right.
57408: You'll die if you go to sleep now!
57462: What should I do now (dare I ask)? 
Well?
57500: Well, there's not much to see.
57538: You can't go that way.
57556: You're on a space station.  This is nothing special in itself, but for
some reason, due to your body's genetics, your very presence is causing the
station to become unstable.  Stay aboard, and the station will explode. 

You
wake up this morning, intending to leave.  Unfortunately, the station's
instability has already caused the station layout to change dramatically, and
no one on the station even recognizes you...
57858: Try not to mess up too quickly.
57978: The station explodes.
58004: You just started playing!
58024: Think about where you have to be before you are sent by a transporter.
58072: Strange as it may seem, don't shy away from wearing something extra.
58120: You must interact with the guard once.
58244: Learn how to use the "Transporter Boomerang".
58280: I'm very sorry, but you must start over.
58312: The trap door will open, but you must "PUT" an object there first.
58364: Help yourself to some fried chicken, Extra Crispy.
58404: If all else fails, usually a two-word command will work.
58444: The game recognizes the first nine letters of a word as significant. But
some words can be abbreviated.
58516: Aside from INVENTORY, HELP, QUIT, SAVE, RESTORE, and verb synonyms,
every verb in "VOCAB" will need to be used at least once.
58628: You don't necessarily need to solve every puzzle to win the game.
58676: Every object that you can pick up has some sort of use.
58714: Here is part of your vocabulary: 
INVENTORY, GET, TAKE, DROP, REMOVE,
WEAR, GIVE, FLIP, PULL, PUSH, MOVE, PUT, TILT, STRAIGHTEN, TURN, ROTATE, SAVE,
RESTORE, OPEN, GO, ENTER, HELP, LOOK, EXAMINE, and VOCAB.
59182: You are left stranded in outer space with no air and quickly die from
suffocation.
59676: as soon as your hand touches the ground, the effects accelerate, and the
room quickly dematerializes. You are left stranded in outer space with no air
and quickly die from suffocation.
60036: This is a modest bathroom with doorways leading east and southeast. You
can see a sink and a toilet here.
60112: Trust me - if there were anything in there, you wouldn't want to know
about it.
60204: This is a small walk-in closet with exits to the northeast and
northwest.
60388: There seems to be a book missing.
60412: The bookcase slides back into the wall, revealing a transporter.
60460: Strange...all the pages are blank.

60568: He has five rings on one hand, and four on the other.
60608: You can see a security guard here.
60632: You can see a security guard here.  He sees that you are wearing nothing
and arrests you for indecent exposure. 

Next time, show a little less vanity.
60740: The guard says, "Oh, thanks, stranger.  I've been looking for this." He
then walks off, leaving the east exit open. 

What he says distresses you.  Not
because he couldn't find the ring, but because he called you "stranger".  He's
Roger - your best friend for the past fifteen years.  No one on this space
station recognizes you.
61046: If you gave it a good pull, it would probably come right out of the
ceiling.
61100: The chandelier comes crashing down and breaks into pieces. A panel in
the west wall slides back, revealing an opening.

northeast or east.
61348: A security guard is firing lasers in your direction, to no avail.
61540: A ladder leads up.
61556: A pile of parts lies to the east.
61580: It turns out the pile of parts is emitting dangerous levels of
radiation...radiation that rips through you like an atomic bomb.
61668: This is someone's storage area, but it appears to have been abandoned.
The only exit is back down.
61828: Exits lead northeast, east and west.
61970: With no friends to check up on you, and your corpse still on board, the
station is left to explode.
62040: There's a cheerful little wall crusher to the west, and a nice little
Death Laser to the north to liven up the room.  Yeah.  This is great. 

By the
way, you may also exit to the southwest.
62176: This is a hallway leading toward the recreation area.
62216: You're nearing the recreation area, but a deadly laser from a security
beam quickly puts an end to your fun.
62292: You are walking through a trash compactor.  Exits lead north and east.
62344: The trash compactor starts to move inward, and before you know it, you
are a pancake.
62464: You are at an intersection in the corridor with exits in all directions.
62550: It cracks, and before you have the chance to scramble back, it breaks,
and you fall through into space.
62624: You have come to a dead end in the corridor.
62670: You have to go back the way you came.
62700: Don't ask ME how we got here!

63144: There is a trap door here.
63164: There is nothing to pull the door open with.
63196: The plunger sticks to the trap door.
63224: This room is full of vending machines, all covered in a thick blanket of
dust.
63280: You see defunct bags of chips, long-dead gum, and "matured" chocolate
bars, but more intriguing is a sticker on the side of one of them, which has a
code written on it: "
63400: This is someone else's bathroom.
63426: There is someone in the tub. 
He spots you, and ticked off at the
invasion of his privacy, picks up his gun from beside the tub, and perforates
you.
63532: You're in a room full of switches.  You can't tell just by looking what
each switch does, because they're laid out for the dimwit in Room 312. Most
switches will do you no good, but you see one that you remember being useful.
63692: Okay - I think something happened in a distant room.
63760: It is quite thoroughly stuck to the trap door.
63942: A doorway leads north.
64046: Paths lead east, south and southwest.
64122: After a second, the whirring stops.
64192: Machines block most of the exits, but there is an open passage to the
northeast.
64354: As a result, you have completely ceased to exist.
64406: You ran headlong into a pile of dead computer parts.
64530: Many of the things here cannot be identified.
64564: It has a keypad on the side.
64584: Enter the combination (A hollow voice says: "Bwahahaha!"):
64772: The clamp then disconnects from the boots automatically.
64812: The clamp appears next to your feet.
64840: That idea isn't very practical, but it is amusing.
64876: The two connect, so either object is referred to now as "CLAMP".
64970: You have to go back the way you came.
65000: Don't ask ME how we got here!
65024: There seems to be a button in the middle.
65056: The ceiling opens and a ladder descends.
65104: A ladder leads down and out.
65238: You bleed profusely, and very quickly but painfully die from the blood
loss.
65516: What a rude dude.
65566: An exit leads east, and hallways lead north and west.
65604: This is a passage through the shuttle bay leading east to west.
65678: Piles of junk parts line the west and east sides of the room, leaving a
very narrow north-south passageway.
65900: This is a passage through the shuttle bay leading east to west.
65978: A shuttle awaits to the west and passages lead south and east.
66054: Passages lead north to south. Junk parts line the east side of the room,
but there is an opening that you could go through...
66520: No, you're not alive enough!
66544: You have reached the shuttle entrance.
66690: The gravity is disabled, and all the security robots have floated to the
top of the ceiling.
66810: And I do mean "up".
66914: You have succeeded in escaping from the station, and you are alive!
67048: There is a smuggler here.  He sees you and levels his gun at you... 

He
keeps firing, but somehow the laser light bounces right off you and gets
deflected and ricochets off the walls right back at him, killing him.  There's
not a trace of him left.
67224: There is a smuggler here.  He sees you and levels his gun at you...


He's so trigger-happy that even after he's killed you he keeps blasting away
for hours and hours until the battery in his laser finally gives out.  There's
not a trace of you left.
67412: Okay, the gravity's supposedly off, but you don't notice any difference.
67464: Crazy, useless devices seem to be the norm in this room, but most of
what you can see in here is nailed down to the floor.
67622: Well, I told you it was strange!
67646: Well, you have the crazy thing now... 

Do you want to put it on? (y/n)
67704: Try as you might, you can't seem to do that.
