80122: A flying saucer is hovering before you, violently shaking the ground of
the area as its burning engines emit a deafening roar.
80209: There is a flying saucer parked here.
80255: You attempt to climb the saucer, but only slip off its smooth surface.
80306: The heat from the engines drives you back.
80356: You see no sign of a door on the surface of the ship.
80395: The heat from the engines prevents you from approaching the ship.
80459: Apart from producing a resonant metallic sound, this has no effect.
80508: The heat from the engines prevents you getting any closer to the saucer.
80582: The spaceship is far too heavy.
80605: The heat from the engines prevents you getting any closer to the saucer.
80663: The smooth surface of the saucer offers no good surface.
80815: A humming noise permeates the air.
80876: An intense whining sound comes from outside the TARDIS.
80926: A deafing roar shakes the ground violently as the saucer prepares to
blast off.
80991: A loud whining sound drifts through the air.
81059: A loud humming noise suddenly comes from over the side of the ledge.
81115: A loud humming noise suddenly fills the air.
81155: Without warning, the saucer begins vibrating violently as it starts its
engines. A loud humming fills your ears as the saucer smoothly rises from the
ground. You find it impossible to stay on top of the saucer, and you tumble
down its polished surface...
81466: A humming noise begins drifting through the air.
81513: A humming sound suddenly enters the TARDIS from somewhere outside.
81587: The humming from below the ledge intensifies into a deafening whine.

81950: The ground trembles slightly as you hear a muffled rumbling from
somewhere outside.
82027: A deafening roar fills the air.  Quickly looking up, you see a flying
saucer blasting upwards into the sky.
82109: A deafening roar shakes the ground as the spaceship's thrusters fire and
it rockets upwards into the sky.  Unfortunately, you do not fully appreciate
this spectacle, as you are burned to death by the blast from the engines.
82270: The earth tremors as a loud roar fills the air.  Looking up, you can see
a spacecraft blasting upwards into the sky.
82401: On the scanner, you just make out the form of a spacecraft rocketting
into the sky.
82532: You feel their heat on your face.
82611: The heat is nearly unbearable.
82651: The engines are far too hot to touch.
82693: Marks on the ground are hardly moveable.
82826: The saucer's surface appears smooth and unbroken.
83058: You suspect that whoever took the Brain of Morbius is in that saucer.
83121: The ship is far beyond your reach.
83391: You suspect that whoever took the Brain of Morbius is in this saucer.
83460: The sky above you is a murky brown colour, shrouded in perpetual
twilight.
83610: Attempting to hoist yourself upwards, you lose your foothold and slide
down the smooth, polished sides of the saucer...
83702: You slide down the smooth, polished sides of the saucer...
83758: The surface of the saucer is quite featureless except for a small hatch.
83824: You suspect that whoever took the Brain of Morbius is inside this
spaceship.
83891: Aside from making a resonant metallic sound, this has no effect.
83949: You can't move a spaceship!
83974: You see no sign of a door.
84018: The scarf is firmly attached to the signpost on the ledge high above.
84072: Attempting to hoist yourself upwards, you lose your foothold and slide
down the smooth, polished sides of the saucer...
84518: The hatch is already open.
84597: It appears you can't open it with your hands.
84690: You slam the hatch shut.
84709: The hatch is already closed.
84767: It is openable at one end.
84790: It is open at one end, revealing that it is empty.
84892: You'd rather not risk losing the acid inside.
84965: It's already closed.
85113: As it bounces down the sides of the saucer, it pops open at one end
spilling its acidic contents on the ground below.
85208: The sky above you is a murky brown colour, shrouded in perpetual
twilight.

85592: The sky above you is a murky brown colour, shrouded in perpetual
twilight.
85649: Beneath your feet is solid rock.
85740: It's bark is black and twisted, and the sight of its dead branches
snaking upwards into the dark sky send a shiver down your spine.
85884: None of the remaining branches are low enough to climb onto.
85940: As you heave yourself up onto the lowest branch it suddenly snaps off
the dead tree, and you land on the ground with a thud.
86040: The tree is firmly rooted.
86066: The dead branches snake ominously into the dark sky.
86168: The remaining branches are beyond your reach.
86219: The dead branch is jammed between the floor plate overhead and the shaft
floor.
86382: It's about 1.5 meters long.
86513: Just as it looks as if the branch is about to snap into two, the huge
boulder shifts and topples over the side of the plateau into the clearing
below.
86660: Looking over the side of the plateau you see the boulder rolling out of
sight to the east.
86880: Just as it looks as if the branch is about to snap into two, the huge
boulder shifts and topples over the side of the plateau into the clearing
below.
87027: Looking over the side of the plateau you see the boulder rolling out of
sight to the east.
87191: The branch breaks off with a loud snap.
87246: You pull the withered branch out from under the boulder.
87294: Taken.
87414: Taken.
87555: The branch breaks off with a loud snap.

twilight.
87653: Beneath your feet is solid rock.
87692: The sky above you is a murky brown colour, shrouded in perpetual
twilight.
87749: Beneath your feet is solid rock.
87778: You recognize this corpse to be the battered remains of the body created
for Morbius's brain by the brilliant but insane neurologist Solon. It's a
horrific conglomeration of the parts of several different creatures. Quite
unattractive.  Instead of a head, however, there is a plastic globe which acted
as an artificial brain-case.
88023: You can see the battered remains of a hideously disfigured creature at
the base of the cliff.
88088: The twisted body of Morbius lies here at the base of the cliff.
88138: That's truly sick.
88164: You'd sooner not touch the body.
88199: You have no chance of climbing such a massive cliff face.
88242: It's a transparent plastic globe, rather like a fish bowl.  When
Morbius' brain was housed in it, you could almost read his thoughts.
88347: Only now do you suddenly notice the absence of the brain within the
case!  You search around the base of the cliff, but find no sign of the brain
of Morbius.  Looking inside the globe, you notice that the nerves which
connected the grotesque body to the brain have been carefully severed with a
laser cutter.  Somebody has been here before you and stolen Morbius' brain!
88621: You'd sooner not touch the body.
88660: The sky above you is a murky brown colour, shrouded in perpetual
twilight.
88717: Beneath your feet is solid rock.
88752: What do you want with a pile of rubble?
88804: Searching through the rubble, you find a scalpel.
88841: You find nothing of interest.
88909: They lead upwards out of sight.
88932: Some stone steps lead back down the mountain.
89062: You'd have to move the mountain too.
89128: The sky above you is a murky brown colour, shrouded in perpetual
twilight.
89185: Beneath your feet is solid rock.
89224: The sky above you is a murky brown colour, shrouded in perpetual
twilight.
89281: Beneath your feet is solid rock.
89310: You seem to have reached a small plateau, which overlooks a rocky
clearing far below.
89504: The sky above you is a murky brown colour, shrouded in perpetual
twilight.
89561: Beneath your feet is solid rock.
89702: It won't budge.
89723: It's far too heavy.
89745: The sides of the boulder are too smooth to be climbed.
90075: "Warning, Master.  Power levels critical."
90124: "Warning.  Power levels low, Master."
90200: Its sides are worn smooth and round by the wind.
90272: It stands precipitously at the edge of the plateau.
90365: A long withered branch has been jammed underneath the boulder, its free
end sticking upwards at a steep angle.
90450: An enormous boulder blocks the trail to the southeast.
90489: Against the western rockface stands an enormous boulder.
90556: There's a tiny space between the boulder and the ground.
90609: One end of a long withered branch has been jammed under the boulder.
90668: It doesn't budge.
90688: Summoning all your strength, you push against the boulder, but it
refuses to budge any more.
90761: You push against the boulder with all your might and manage to roll it a
few centimeters towards the edge of the plateau, exposing a tiny space beneath
it.
90879: It won't budge.
90892: The boulder rocks slightly.
90920: The boulder is far too heavy to be carried.
90955: You merely slide down its smooth sides.
91279: "Warning, Master.  Power levels critical."
91328: "Warning.  Power levels low, Master."
91375: It's just a tiny gap underneath the huge boulder.
91412: One end of a long withered branch is jammed into the space, its other
end sticking upwards at a steep angle.
91501: The tiny gap is just too tiny.
91586: The other end sticks upwards at a steep angle.
91626: You see only darkness within.
91671: Solid rock is above you.
91694: Beneath your feet is solid rock.
91722: You're in a dark passage carved into the rock.
91860: Dim light comes from underneath it.
91927: Solid rock is above you.
91950: Beneath your feet is solid rock.
92044: The sky above you is a murky brown colour, shrouded in perpetual
twilight.
92101: Beneath your feet is solid rock.
92134: The doors are solidly locked.
92161: The doors are already closed.
92189: You know better than to antagonize the Sisterhood by breaking and
entering into their sacred temple.
92267: I don't think the Sisterhood would appreciate it if you stole their
front door.
92331: The sturdy oak doors resist your efforts.
92374: The doors swing open and you many hands grab you and drag you into the
Temple.  You are thrown at the feet of Ohica who looks down from her throne
lividly.
92574: have defiled our Temple. Begone!"
92751: There is no reply.
92766: The doors slowly creak open and one of the Sisters emerges. Upon
recognizing you, she stands aside and you step into the Temple...
93188: To the north, a passageway leads out of the Temple.
93240: Ohica addresses you:
    "Doctor! You have returned to Karn. Although we
owe you our gratitude for your help in the destruction of Morbius and for
restoring the Flame, we do not wish for the presence of outsiders on Karn,
particularly Timelords."
93431: Bidding farewell to Ohica, you are led out of the Temple...
93503: cuefpm onto the floor, Ohica frowns darkly at you.
  "Do not litter in
our Sacred Temple, Doctor!"
You shamefully pick
93610: Bidding farewell to Ohica, you are led out of the Temple...
93673: "Where do you think you're going, Timelord?" snaps Ohica.
93732: "Do not touch our sacred Wooden Door!" shrieks Ohica.
93797: "Do not touch our sacred Tapestry!" commands Ohica angrily.
94098: To the north, a passageway leads out of the Temple.
94149: You'd better watch your step here.  If the Sisterhood discover any trace
of your uninvited visit to their Sacred Temple, they won't be pleased.
94293: Without warning, you feel your body paralyzed by an invisible force. 
You struggle to free yourself, but in vain.  You feel faint as your
surroundings shimmer and fade around you.  Everything goes black and you pass
out.

When you awake, you are surprised to find yourself in the Temple of the
Sisterhood of Karn.  Ohica sits before you on her throne, her eyes blazing with
anger.  The rest of the Sisterhood crowds around you.
94647: From behind the closed wooden door, you hear the muffled sound of soft
chanting.  It seems the Sisters are performing one of their Sacred Ceremonies.
94759: The chanting from behind the door gets louder.
94799: You hear what sounds like a cymbal crash from behind the wooden door.
94867: You hear what sounds like a gong behind the door to the south.
94917: You hear what sounds like a glokenspiel behind the door to the south.
95034: The sound of castinettes comes from behind the wooden door.
95082: The sound of a triangle comes from behind the wooden door.
95130: The sound of a bass drum comes from behind the wooden door.
95239: You think you hear the sound of a kazoo from behind the wooden door.
95293: You think you hear the sound of a harmonica from behind the wooden door.
95351: You think you hear the sound of a whistle from behind the wooden door.
95407: You think you hear the sound of a flute from behind the wooden door.
95536: You hear what sounds like a drum solo from behind the door to the south.
95656: You hear what sounds like a tuba from behind the door to the south.
95710: You hear what sounds like a bass solo from behind the door to the south.
95771: You hear what sounds like applause from behind the door to the south and
then silence.
95840: The wooden door creaks open and Ohica marches into the room followed by
the Sisterhood.  You try to slip away, but find yourself paralyzed by an unseen
psychic force.  Ohica steps towards you with fire in her eyes.

"So, Timelord!
96283: You helplessly float towards the Flame of Life, suffering an agonizing
death...
96355: I wouldn't disturb the Sisterhood if I were you.
96397: Strange chanting comes from behind the door.
96454: The noise behind the door suddenly stops.
96485: You knock on the door.
96510: The doors are solidly locked.
96537: The doors are already closed.
96651: I don't think the Sisterhood would appreciate it if you stole their
front door.
96715: The sturdy oak doors resist your efforts.
96758: The chanting behind the door suddenly stops.
96835: From your previous visit to Karn, you know that the Flame of Life is
behind that shield.
96905: The shield has been swung open, revealing the Flame of Life.
96964: As you swing the shield open, you feel the heat from the Flame of Life
on your face.
97033: You swing the shield shut, concealing the Flame of Life.
97085: Ouch! Hot!
97444: A small amount of silver liquid flows out from beneath the Flame and
drips into the fluid link within the chalice below.
97714: It tastes horrible!
97733: It's odourless.
97777: You cough and wretch as you drink the foul-tasting liquid.
97905: You pour the silver liquid into the chalice where it mixes with the
colourless liquid.
97970: You recognize the chalice to be the cup from which the Sisterhood drink
the Elixir of Life.
98244: sending a ball of fire into your face.  Momentarily blinded, you drop
the chalice, spilling its contents onto the floor.
98414: It smells a little like stewed apricot.
98448: You'll have to pick up the chalice first.
98483: It has a strange yet familar taste.
98518: You smell a trace of stewed apricot.
98550: The murky liquid tastes horrible, but leaves an aftertaste of stewed
apricot.
98610: You'll have to pick up the chalice first.
98660: "Do not touch our sacred Shield!", commands Ohica.
98708: Ohica jumps out of her throne angrily.  "Blasphemy! You have defiled our
sacred Temple.  Begone and never return, Timelord!"

Several Sisters run into
the room, grab you and brusquely escort you out of the Temple...
98890: "Do not touch our sacred Chalice!", shrieks Ohica.
98938: Ohica leaps from her throne.  "Blasphemy! You mean to steal the Elixir!
You have defiled our Temple, Timelord.  Begone! 

Several Sisters appear to
brusquely escort you from the Temple...
99094: The tapestry is made of a thick rich cloth and is ornamentally decorated
with what looks like gold.
99370: You carefully draw the tapestry to one side, revealing a large chamber
to the west.
99434: You carefully draw the tapestry to one side, revealing a dark passageway
leading to the east.
99504: The tapestry has already been pulled open.
99549: You silently draw the tapestry back to its original position.
99599: It appears firmly attached.
99651: Ohica shrieks out, and the rest of the Sisterhood streams into the room,
quickly subduing you.  Ohica rises angrily from her throne.
   "Your actions
show us you have been sent by the Timelords to destroy the Sisterhood. My
Sisters, dispatch him!"
   Before you can react, the Sisters club you to death
with their high heels.
99892: "I'm not asleep, Doctor."
99961: "You have offended the Sisterhood with your poor sense of fashion. You
have defiled the Temple! Sisters, remove him!"
  Several Sisters appear and
rudely escort you from the Temple...
100143: "How dare you! You have defiled the Temple! Sisters, remove him!"
  
Several Sisters appear and escort you from the Temple rather discourteously. 
Just before you are thrown out, you glimpse the trace of a smile on Ohica's
face...
100405: "Impossible! The Sisterhood sees all that happens on Karn."
100468: "The Elixir of Life is the sacred gift of the Flame, and bestows us
with eternal life so we may worship the Flame."
100620: For this we receive the Elixir, for only those who worship the Flame
deserve eternal life."
100790: "Karn is a better place without that despicable creature."
100840: "Maron is dead, but her memory lives within the Flame."
100930: With your help, we were able to destroy him, forcing him to fall to his
death from a great height."
101008: "Your time machine is nothing compared to the power of the Sisterhood."
101068: "I suggest you avoid swimming in the lake, Timelord."
101146: We serve the Flame."
101179: "We know nothing of any spacecraft."
101210: "I do not obey the orders of Timelords."
101263: Ohica drums her fingers on the throne.
101299: Ohica sighs impatiently.
101327: Ohica figits restlessly.
101356: Ohica stands up.  "Doctor, we thank you for your visit, but we have
much Sacred Business to attend to.  We bid you farewell and trust that your
stay on Karn will be a short one."
   A rather tough-looking Sister enters the
room and escorts you out of the Temple.
101785: You can't see any such thing.
101822: The metal hatch is closed.
101848: Your hands are too full to climb down the ladder.
101940: The floor, walls and ceiling are constructed of a seamless metal.
102116: The metal hatch is closed.
102142: Your hands are too full to climb down the ladder.
102188: The metal hatch is closed.
102214: Your hands are too full to climb down the ladder.
102270: The reactor hums powerfully.
102368: With every passing moment, more heat is being produced by the reactor.
102436: The reactor is far too heavy to be moved.
102477: The sides of the reactor are warm, and vibrate slightly.
102518: Ouch! Hot to the touch!
102544: This reactor is a little more sophisticated than that.
102601: The glass bubble on the control bank turns blue and the reactor starts
humming loudly.  A metallic voice drifts across the chamber: 
   "Warning. 
Core temperature exceeded.  T-minus ten until shutdown."
102815: The humming increases and the room becomes noticably warmer.
102949: The temperature increases steadily as the reactor begins to vibrate
violently.
103085: Danger.  Cooling system failing."
103163: Smoke begins pouring out of the edges of the reactor.
103281: Critical.  Core implosion imminent."
103361: The reactor is shaking so violently that it looks as if it's about to
come free of its foundations.  The air is so full of steam and smoke that it's
nearly impossible to see.
103500: From outside the TARDIS, you hear a massive explosion as the reactor
core erupts.  The TARDIS is practically indestructable, but even it can't
withstand a massive anti-matter explosion within such close proximity.  The
last thing you see is a blinding white light as your body melts away...
103713: You hear a massive explosion as the reactor core erupts.  The last
thing you see is a blinding white light as both your surroundings and your body
melt away...
104088: You'll have to start pushing buttons.
104131: You heave against the control bank, but it won't budge.
104182: "I think this problem requires a finer touch, Master."
104228: I think this problem requires a finer touch.
104286: Nothing happens.
104314: You hear a muffled clunk from within the closed hatch.
104391: The hatch in the floor pops open with a loud groan.
104430: It's a tiny display screen, no more than one square inch in
size.
Currently, the display reads:
104518: The display reads:
104558: It's firmly embedded into the control bank.
104598: The light glows blue.
104615: The light glows yellow.
104650: It's firmly embedded into the control bank.
104687: The light doesn't shift.
104716: The metal hatch is closed.
104742: Your hands are too full to climb down the ladder.
104832: Beneath your feet, you can hear a muffled creaking sound.  You lurch as
the floor sinks a little.  Suddenly, you hear a snap and the floor falls out
beneath your feet, taking you with it...
105048: Oh dear.  The floor appears to be missing in this room.  You tumble
downwards...
105170: The bubble glows with blue light.
105199: The bubble glows with yellow light.
105250: The glass bubble is beyond your reach.
105283: Ouch! It's hot to the touch.
105306: There's no point trying to take the glass bubble.
105351: The doorway is empty, its edges charred and twisted.
105422: There's some lettering on its formidable surface.
105467: An empty doorway in the east wall leads into a corridor.
105508: An empty doorway in the west wall leads to a reactor room.
105630: On the west wall is a formidable metal door.
105760: How can you do that to an empty doorway?
105789: The solid door doesn't budge.
105891: As soon as you turn on the sonic screwdriver and point it at the door
the glass bubble above the door starts flashing and you can hear an alarm going
off.
106000: You sense a large figure looming behind you, but before you can turn
around you feel a painful blow to the back of your neck and everything goes
dark...
106116: Hearing some movement behind you, you spin around and see a Cyberman
standing before you.  Before you can react, it grabs you by the neck and
squeezes...
106238: Not even the sonic screwdriver can unlock this door.
106510: You sense a large figure looming behind you, but before you can turn
around you feel a painful blow to the back of your neck and everything goes
dark...
106626: Hearing some movement behind you, you spin around and see a Cyberman
standing before you.  Before you can react, it grabs you by the neck and
squeezes...
106743: You feel the heat on your face as the door buckles and twists. Soon the
door turns white with the intense heat and melts away into nothingness.
106869: "Warning.  Power levels low, Master."
106914: "Warning.  Power levels critical, Master."
106999: You climb up onto the metal table...
107051: The table slides across the floor a little.
107088: The table is too heavy to carry.
107122: You climb up onto the metal table...
107156: You push the table along the metal floor...
107261: V.
107265: As you attempt to move past the sensor, it swings around and blasts you
with a laser beam...
107364: As you attempt to move past the sensor, it swings around and blasts you
with a laser beam...
107475: As you attempt to move past the sensor, it swings around and blasts you
with a laser beam...

147785: The Cyberman enters the room.  Upon seeing you, it immediately points a
three-fingered hand in your direction. Sparks erupt from the tips of its
fingers and envelop you in electric death...
147954: A Galactic servant, that's what you feel like at the moment.  You'd
think that the Timelords would be pleased that you were not only responsible
for discovering that Morbius' brain had been secretly kept alive, but that you
were instrumental in destroying the revived villian.  Do they offer you their
gratitude?  No, they merely point out that you left the Brain of Morbius on
Karn and demand that you retrieve it and bring it back to Gallifrey.  That's
gratitude for you.

However, as you value your own freedom, you really don't
have much choice but to do as the Timelords request.  At least they gave you
the coordinates for Karn, but you did notice that they refused to give you
return coordinates for Gallifrey, saying you'd receive them once you'd procured
the brain.  So much for Gallifreyan hospitality...

Your thoughts are
interrupted as you hear a familiar thud.  The TARDIS has landed on Karn.
150584: FOLLOW ME

Compound commands can be created by
connecting single commands (like those above) with "THEN" or the punctuation
symbol "." to connect two or more separate commands.

Below are a few examples
of valid compound commands:

     TAKE THE THERMAL LANCE THEN PUT IT IN THE
TOOLKIT
     PRESS THE GREEN BUTTON.  TURN THE KNOB.

If the game understands
all of the words in your command, but still seems confused by the command --
then try to say the same thing using fewer words and a simpler sentence.  When
in doubt, simplify your commands as much as possible.  This also saves typing
effort.


SPECIAL COMMANDS:

The game uses a number of special commands for
various "housekeeping" chores.  These are all pretty standard for most
adventure games, specifically:

HELP           Brings up these
instructions.
SCORE          Will summarize your progress, so far.
INVENTORY   
  Will display a list of the items you are
               carrying, and those
items you are wearing.
               (also: I)
BRIEF          Will cause
location descriptions to be brief.
VERBOSE        Will cause location
descriptions to be 
               verbose.

LOOK           Will give you a
full (verbose) description of 
               your current location.
SAVE      
    Will save the current game status on disk.
RESTORE        Will restore a
previously saved game from 
               disk.
QUIT           Quits the
current game session.  Always exit 
               using QUIT
RESTART       
Restarts the game from the very beginning

Overall, just type in simple english
phrases (e.g. PUT BATTERY IN COMPARTMENT) and worry about correct phrasing if
the game has any difficulty understanding you.
152014: BACKGROUND INFORMATION: "THE BRAIN OF MORBIUS"
152140: This game is based on the characters and circumstances first presented
in the Doctor Who television serial "The Brain of Morbius" written by Robin
Bland (a pseudonym for Terrance Dicks and Robert Holmes), directed by
Christopher Barry and starring Tom Baker as Dr. Who.  First broadcast January 3
- January 24, 1976.
152383: Morbius was once the leader of the High Council of the Timelords (the
Doctor's race from the planet Gallifrey).  Using his exalted position, he tried
to lead the Timelords down a path towards destruction and conquest.  He
promised eternal life to his fanatical followers (who numbered in the millions)
and came to the planet Karn to seize the Elixir of Life from the Sisterhood.
152656: The Sisterhood guard and worship the Sacred Flame of Life, which
produces the Elixir of Life through a chemical reaction of volcanic gases and
heat, resulting in a clear liquid which the Sisterhood collect and ingest in
order to extend their lives indefinitely.  Uniquely in the galaxy, the
Sisterhood are equal to the Timelords in terms of mental prowess, and in the
past Timelords had use of the elixir occassionally.  The Sisterhood tolerate
the Timelords as they fear their power, but they remain skeptical of all
outsiders, assuming all visitors to Karn come to steal the Elixir.
153069: Eventually, the Timelords caught up with Morbius on Karn, but not
before the entire civilization of the planet was destroyed by his fanatical
search for the Elixir.  The Sisterhood was involved in Morbius' capture, and
many people came to Karn to witness his trial. Morbius was seemingly destroyed
in a dispersal chamber.
153300: When the Doctor originally arrived on Karn, he discovered that the
brilliant neurosurgeon Solon had somehow stolen Morbius' brain before his body
was destroyed, and had kept it secretly alive in a tank in his laboratory while
he tried to create a viable body to support the brain.  Eventually, Morbius was
ressurected in a grotesque bodily form constructed of the body parts of several
different creatures.  Aided by the Sisterhood, the Doctor managed to discover
Solon's plot.  Both Solon and Morbius were killed.  The last we saw of Morbius
was his plunge to a certain death over a high clifftop on Karn.
