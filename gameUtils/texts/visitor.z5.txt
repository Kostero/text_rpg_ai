Gladys has multiple responses for most topics, and
some notion of what has been said.
The idea for the portrait came from the many
elderly ladies I met doing voluntary work, and some of my Great Aunts.  I hope
I have done them justice.

this week."

51428: "Well can't talk about the weather all day, you know, much too english!"
twinkles Gladys.
51536: I get some physio for them." responds Gladys.
51572: "You been asking the staff?" asks Gladys suspiciously.
51612: "It was wonderful to go out and have a good natter." Gladys enthuses, "I

cake and all that." says Gladys. "Its my annual outing now, all I have to look
forward to."
51820: Gladys answers "Yes, it was a nice party, the day centre is warm and all
the balloons livened it up."

cards from her and the family." says Gladys quietly.
52680: "He's a nice enough chap, quite a catch for Jane, although I always
found him a bit reserved." says Gladys.
52760: "He has done well in the bank, in the head office in Edinburgh I think."
remarks Gladys.
52828: "I wish he'd let Jane come here sometimes." says Gladys resignedly.

52988: "He went to University you know, working with computers and whatnot.
He's now working in america, doing really well Jane says." says Gladys with
pride.

practically countryside, much cleaner air."
53872: Gladys answers "You know something, I never been to the British Museum.
Still I did see a lot of lovely shows in the West End."

54072: "Sorry what were you saying?" asks Gladys.
54104: Gladys does not respond at all, but blows her nose.
54140: "Err can't really say ..." mumbles Gladys.
54176: Gladys ignores you and turns to look out the Window.
54216: "Really, how interesting ..." says Gladys, but you can tell she is not
really interested.
54284: Gladys looks at you in bewilderment.
54312: Old and wrinkled with two bright eyes looking attentively at you through
glasses.
54368: Bony with bent fingers, you can just see a wedding ring on the left
hand.
