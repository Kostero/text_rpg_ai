45236: Your mind dissolves as it touches the pillow. Today has been a busy day,
and tomorrow will probably be no differant. But your not thinking about that,
because your mind has already dissolved.

Like liquid, your thoughts drip
together, falling from mist and mildew. Soon a dream forms. A small lizard is
dancing to bad jazz. He's on his hind legs, kicking like Russians must have
kicked during the Cold War. After what seems like minutes, he turns to you. His
tounge flickers like a dying candle. There are no sounds, yet his tounge's
writhing and curls seem to talk. "I am the Toe. Tips nil like math ah tame kill
in spit."  Then the tounge stretches over to your face and pokes your eyes.
Blinded, your nostrils suddenly become extrasensory as the scent of burn engine
oil streams in. Then your ears go into overdrive as a manic laughter surrounds
your being. The scariest part, is your not so sure that it's not you laughing.
You start running. Blindly.
