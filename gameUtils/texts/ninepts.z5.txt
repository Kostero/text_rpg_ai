43367: You are teetering on the verge of a discovery...
43435: In this short sample game, you are exploring your great uncle's house.
He was a treasure hunter, and you entered in hopes of finding some of his
valuables. Unfortunately, the house is very old; the lounge door jammed shut
unexpectedly....
43620: it's just something you keep handy, for your incipient ulcer. The label
says "Doctor Tung's Epicene Digestive Remedy!"
43714: The bottle is closed.
43757: The bottle is open, but empty.
43808: Xnone tiny purple pill.
44244: You swallow the pill. A wave of warmth soothes the turmoil of your
innards. Once again, you are terribly, terribly grateful to Dr. Tung and his
weird little herb shop.
44370: You swallow the pill -- probably a good idea, after the things you've
been eating.
44578: The old, warped door creaks peculiarly as you approach.
45052: you are standing in your great uncle's bedroom. There is an antique bed
on one side of the room, and a lot of antique furniture on the other.
45163: To the south is the door you entered by.
45202: The door to the south is closed.
45227: Light shines through a window to the north.
46147: you stretch up and look out the window. There's nothing out there but
the fire escape ladder.
46348: . It has been moved to reveal a passage to the east.
46412: ornate and well-crafted, it has small bits of ivory embellishing its
edges. Fake books on all subjects stand on the shelves, filling it completely
46561: . The bookcase looks like it's floating about two inches off the ground.
46619: It has been moved to reveal a passage to the east.
46669: you run a finger along the side of the bookcase. When you reach the
bottom, you notice slide-rails under the case.
46757: the bookcase is too big for you to carry. But it rattles slightly as you
tug it.
47194: Warily, you enter the inky blackness....
47344: Among the fake books is a loose book.
47376: There is a hole in the row of fake books.
47475: . You feel a loose book among the fake books.
47617: the spine is labelled "Murphy's Laws of Interactive Fiction."
47691: the book is labelled "Murphy's Laws of Interactive Fiction." It runs
through a list of funny truths about interactive fiction. Perhaps you'll read
the Laws later.
47828: Law #1: Examine everything, maybe even twice.
47883: Law #2: Any sentence that can be misunderstood, will.
47942: Law #3: Twisty little passages are always alike.
47989: Law #4: Take anything that isn't nailed down.
48158: Wow! The book whispers in your ear: "Getting pretty desperate, aren't
you?
48275: Yeah, that's right!  You don't need no stinking book!
48627: slowly, you push one finger into the darkness, followed by your hand,
then your arm up to your shoulder... You feel around; there must be a sizable
room back there. Too bad that bookcase is blocking the way in.
48921: A very large green plant sits in a pot in the corner of the room.
48970: A dirt-filled pot sits in the corner of the room.
49062: But wait, there's something hidden in the pot... a rusty key! You take
it and weigh it thoughtfully in your hand.
49407: you stick your tongue in the pot. Not bad.
49513: sure, why not? It goes down smooth. Well, smoothish.
49626: Whoa, Man... You are now high as a kite!
49687: you're no gardener. Just stuffing the plant back in won't help.
49736: you can't. The pot is full of dirt.
49911: But wait, there's something hidden in the pot... a rusty key! You take
it and weigh it thoughtfully in your hand.
50005: it bounces back and scratches your finger... Ow!
50059: The plant looks strange to you.
50377: with sensitive listening equipment, it is possible to hear the thoughts
of flora. You have no such equipment.
50461: you stick your tongue on the plant. It's revolting.
50837: Xnyou've found treasure!
51084: You guess that it's where your uncle kneeled to hide his journal under
the bed.
51244: it's the brass lantern your uncle has taken on so many of his
adventures. It has dulled only slightly over the years.
51332: It's somewhat damp now, however.
51627: one if by land, two if by sea... You would have made a great Paul
Revere, but you'd need one more lamp.
51790: You fumble over the lamp's surface; it takes a few moments before you
feel the switch.
51853: The lantern starts humming as it lights up.
52328: the bedroom is beyond the door to the north. You cannot make out much of
what's inside.
52401: man, you're touching everything in sight today... Good!
52571: you've already had one bad experience with doors jamming closed. Better
not.
52678: A scratching sound in the rafters unnerves you.
52720: Shadows flicker in the dim light.
53604: this lounge is incredibly plain. The only homey touch is a plush chair.
An archway leads north, to the hallway. To the south
53701: is the old trophy room, but the door jammed shut when you entered the
lounge. You've been searching for a way out ever since.
54231: It contains only water.
54284: There is a fish in it.
54670: The little red fish moves to the side of the bowl opposite to where you
touched it.
54745: .  The fish flops out of the bowl.
55076: Besides, the bottle is closed.
55608: the lantern dies. You think you just broke it.
55791: Hnyou are sitting in.
56145: you tickle the fish. You swear you can hear it laughing.
56241: The fish begs you with his glassy eyes not to eat him. 
Do you still
want to? >
56928: The fish wriggles excitedly. Its new life out of water doesn't seem to
bother it at all.
57051: ow! You prick your finger on the broken glass. Best leave it alone.
57105: You climb down the ladder and your imagination soars with thoughts of
what you're going to do with the money from the crown....

  Suddenly rough
arms slam you against the side of the house! "He's found it," mutters a low
voice. "Let's go." Something cracks against your head, and your head cracks
against the wall, and you barely see a golden Minoan sceptre clatter to the
ground beside you as you fall. "You never saw the crown. Keep this and be
happy," growls the voice. "And don't go asking questions -- if you know what's
good for you." And then you are alone.

  Your stomach hurts.
58090: Whaa? Oog.
58120: oiivhre. W'guh.

FHWIUOI rwevh TREYERY TWET WE mneggh!
58180: Mmmm... MmmmMMMMmmm... Omm....
58226: Coming down....
58395: This is a small game to get you started playing Interactive Fiction. It
has only a few rooms and a few simple puzzles.

    Most of the conventions in
this game are applicable to all IF. There are many differences between games,
of course. Other games created with Inform, Graham Nelson's excellent adventure
language, are very much like this one. Games created with other languages, such
as TADS, differ in some details, although the differences are small and not
particularly dangerous.
58765: Welcome to the world of Interactive Fiction. If this is your first time
playing an IF game, you'll want to read this section to get acquainted with the
basics quickly.
58891: If you've played IF before, you can still benefit from reading the rest
of this, because it will (probably) reaffirm everything you're thinking about
how to work this game; and who couldn't use a little positive affirmation once
in a while?
59069: If the last IF game you played had a two-word parser, reading this will
help waylay the embarrassing feeling you get when the parser doesn't understand
sentences like "LOOK CHICKEN" (which should be written "LOOK AT CHICKEN" or
"EXAMINE CHICKEN".)
59277: In an IF game, you are put in the position of the protagonist of an
interactive story. The game prints out a description of your location, along
with descriptions of objects in the vicinity and what they are doing.
59789: Commands are written as though you are ordering a troop brigade around.
For instance:
59885: This will cause you to look at the fish; the fish's description will be
displayed. Another way of stating this is:
59999: (Notice that you can omit the word "THE" -- the game doesn't mind. Also,
you don't have to use all upper-case for commands. The examples in this section
are printed in upper-case for visibility, but you can use any capitalization in
your commands, or none.)
60275: are allowed. The shortest way to state LOOK AT THE FISH, then, is:
60427: Here's an in-depth look at a few of the more important verbs in most IF
games:
60491: NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, DOWN, IN, OUT, NORTHEAST, NORTHWEST,
SOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST:
60963: GET (or TAKE): This causes you to pick up an object. Once you do, you'll
carry it wherever you do -- the object is "in your inventory."
61127: Yes, "inventory" is a terrible word, but nobody's thought of a better
one. You'll often want to check your inventory, which is why the next command
has a one-letter abbreviation:
61263: TAKE INVENTORY (or INVENTORY or just I): Prints a list of the objects
which you are carrying.
61353: DROP: Places an object which you are carrying down on the ground.
61409: ENTER: Go inside (or through) an object.
61451: EXIT (or GET OUT or GET UP): Leave an object which you are inside or on
top of.
61559: FISH a little shorter, if you've already used the fish in a command.
61615: Example:
61674: Taken.
61698: Under closer inspection, the hullaballooza is rounder than you thought
it would be.
61764: The IT in the second command is a nice shorthand for "the object that I
referred to in the last command I typed." You can keep using IT instead of the
actual name of an object until you need to refer to a different object.
61928: That covers the quick tutorial; there's a list of other commands in the
next section of the help.
62006: Happy Adventuring!
62072: ty" are objects available for you to use, either in the room or your
inventory. This is not a list of every command! Every game recognizes a few
special actions that only make sense in that setting. Experiment, and use your
imagination.
62569: Here are several useful system commands -- commands that control the
game itself, rather than telling your character what to do.
63107: When you're new to IF, it's easy to type a command which the game
doesn't understand. If you do, you'll get some kind of complaint. This is a
list of the more common complaints, and what to do about them.
63263: This is by far the most common message seen by new and experienced
players alike. It means one of three things:

    1) You tried to refer to an
object using a word that the game doesn't recognise.
    2) The author has
mentioned an object which, sadly, isn't really defined in the game, and you
tried to refer to it.
    3) You made a spelling mistake.
63530: Try using a different word -- preferably the word that the game itself
used. (If you can't find a word that works, it's the author's fault -- see #2.
That object probably isn't important.)
63678: Part of your input was understood, but the game choked on some other
part. This is usually caused by putting words after verbs that don't need
objects... like LOOK.

    LOOK HORSE

    I only understand you as far as
wanting to look.
63869: Rephrase your command.

    EXAMINE HORSE

    Sleek and valiant, this
is the fabled horse of Rock City....
64050: Try to GET the object.
64078: The first word in a command should always be a verb. If the first word
you typed is not recognized as a verb by the game, this message will appear.
64195: Try a different way of stating your command.
64237: Some verbs only work on living things. This message is shown when the
object is not alive, and you try to do something like TALK to it.
64348: Don't talk to rocks.
64374: This means that the object can be looked at, but nothing can be done
with it.
64443: Don't worry about it; the object isn't important.
64491: This occurs when several objects have similar names, and you typed a
command which could refer to any of them.

 Example:

    GET BOOK

    Which
do you mean, the red book, the green book, or the old book?
64660: Type a word or words that will distiguish the object you want. In the
above case:

    RED

    This will tell the game that it is the red book you
want. Or, you could just retype the whole command:

    GET RED BOOK

65547: ) whose presence can be felt everywhere, as he took our sloppy code and
made numerous beneficial changes. He also contributed to the game's atmosphere
with changes in the prose.
66149: But you're not leaving without some treasure.
66318: The coffee table is what we call a "red herring."
66464: But it's fun.
66525: You can't get the stuffing out of the chair.
66722: But you're not leaving without some treasure.

68304: You can't go that way.
68380: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
68412: As good-looking as ever.
68494: this north-south passage is dimly lit. The hardwood floor creaks wearily
with age. Backed against the west wall is a small coffee table. Your great
uncle's old bedroom lies to the north, and the south archway leads to the
lounge.
68734: beyond the southern arch is the lounge, where you came in. From here,
all you can make out is a large chair.
68814: you have never been in this hallway before today. It is lit by the south
opening leading to the lounge.
68890: this coffee table is bolted to the floor. Nothing is on it because the
glass top has been removed.
68980: You can't go that way.
69304: As you enter the bedroom, the door slams shut!
69556: Dude.
69564: Your stomach is horribly upset. If you don't do something about it soon,
you don't know what unspeakable thing might happen....
69656: You feel a twitch in your throat.
69680: You feel a twitch in your nose.
69704: You feel that same twitch in your ears... curious.
69744: Suddenly, but with ample warning, branches burst out of all the orifices
of your head, your skull cracks into three separate pieces, and you die.
69846: Given your uncle's bizarre tastes in furniture, this is a rather
tame-looking bed. It has been stripped of sheets, and four plain wooden posts
rise all the way to the ceiling.

  You notice faint marks on the floor by the
foot of the bed -- a slightly worn spot.
70494: a thick layer of dust covers everything in this room. There are many old
boxes and older bags. Your uncle's bedroom lies to the west.
70926: this ancient Minoan artifact is not only beautiful, but will also net
you a fine price. Of course, you still have to find a way out before you can
sell it.
71240: This chair is very comfortable.
71264: The fish in the fishbowl envies your comfort.
71296: The bare walls envy your comfort.
71320: Man, this chair is better than treasure any day!
71404: Your stomach is horribly upset. If you don't do something about it soon,
you don't know what unspeakable thing might happen....
71496: You feel a bloat in your stomach.
71520: You feel a bloat in your chest.
71544: You feel a rumble in your abdomen... curious.
71580: Suddenly, but with ample warning, a two-headed fish bursts out of your
chest.
71636: You fall to the ground, bleeding profusely, as the leviathan takes its
revenge....
