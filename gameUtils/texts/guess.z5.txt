105356: The smell of cotton candy, warm lemonade, and grass induces an exciting
sort of nausea in your stomach. This year (finally!), your parents have decided
that you're old enough to wander the midway of the Avogadro County Fair without
adult supervision. After sitting through the mandatory safety lecture (a small
price to pay for being spared the Hall of Farming Implements), you are sent off
to fend for yourself for two glorious hours.

Immediately spending
three-quarters of your allotted dollar on a corn dog, you find yourself
curiously drawn by the necessities of the plot to a brightly lit carnival booth
that invites you to...

black boxes. There are no prizes here; only the noun disambiguators,
verb-to-action sequencers, and speech synthesizers that help Lalrry make sense
of the world.
106424: Your parents are standing over you, looking down with expressions of
concern. They are greatly relieved to see your eyes open. Your father stoops

hug.

Come on,
107104: Guess The Verb!
107120: What is IF?
107232: What's Next?
107244: Interactive Fiction is a transgressive new art form used for exploring
relations between work and reader, for breaking new ground in storytelling, and
for challenging traditional conceptions of selfhood. It is not, under any
circumstances, to be used for the purpose of having a good time.

This
interactive fiction story, or "file" as those in the know call it, will change
your very mode of existence. As Dr. Chad Manmusk, workaday researcher at a
mysterious, secluded scientific facility, you explore the frontiers of genetic
engineering and virtual reality. But when your colleagues mysteriously start
dying, you are drawn into a web of deceit and lies. Somehow, your experiments
have gone awry, and the shocking events that unfold will force you to question
your own identity and the nature of reality itself.
107810: This IF text is written using Graham Nelson's "Informatic" programming
language and library. Informatic includes a natural language parser which takes
your commands (imperative English sentences) as input and mediates between you
(the "player"), and the "player character", who inhabits and acts upon (and, in
turn, is acted upon by) a "game world". If you are confused by this, the
following annotated diagram should confuse you some more.
108500: You [YOU] have got to be kidding me [PARSER].
108774: a," he says. I've [PARSER] got another command to process.
109004: The chocolate was poisoned!
109092: The parser is quite sophisticated, and can handle complex English
sentences such as the following:
109810: You can also interact with other people in the game:
110138: >STAN, CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU I LOVE YOU? I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE A THREE-NECKED SAKKVUN FROM SECTOR A0429 AND I'M A
FOOTBALL-FIELD-SIZED HOLOGRAM OF A POISONOUS TREE FROG, BUT THAT CAN'T STOP
THESE FEELINGS I HAVE FOR YOU. PLEASE, TRY TO UNDERSTAND.
110496: MOODY AND THE KITTY CAT, VERONICA. THE LAB FOUND YOUR DNA ON THE BLOB
OF CHEWING GUM AND I FOUND WHERE YOU HID THE HOME HARA-KIRI KIT. I'VE
ASCERTAINED THE TRUE TIME OF DEATH VIA TRIANGULATION OF HEAVENLY BODIES. I EVEN
KNOW WHO PUT THE BOP IN THE BOP SHA BOP SHA BOP. MY ONLY QUESTION IS, WHY,
VERONICA? WHY DID YOU USE AN IRON ON THE THIRD HOLE WHEN THE WIND WAS AGAINST
YOU AND YOU STILL HAD THREE HUNDRED YARDS BETWEEN YOU AND THE GREEN? WHY, YOU
CONNIVING SHREW?
111062: In the rare cases in which your command can't be modeled in the game
world, or might interfere with the plot later down the road, you're sure to get
a witty response back from the parser to mollify your disappointment:
111232: Sorry, I don't understand egg-sactly what you mean by that. Yuk yuk!
111324: Wouldn't you rather have that fried?
111402: From the looks of you, I'd say you've had quite enough eggs.
111528: Remember, above all, that IF encourages exploration, so long as you
don't try anything that doesn't fit in with the author's view of his or her
work. With that in mind, sit back, relax, and enjoy!
111738: Like a more human sage, the river seems a repository of an age's
accumulated knowledge, but says nothing beyond the continual rush of water as
the river rolls in from the northwest and keeps on rolling along to the south.
The river is wide, and, from here at least, uncrossable.
111936: A small balsa wood barge would be carried away on the current, were it
not for the rope holding it to a peg on the bank.
112022: There is a bag of potatoes here.
112050: A bale of cotton sits near the bank, its seeds forming a pile beside
it.
112106: A tipsy midget dressed in Victorian working-class styles dances a jig
on top of the bale.
112238: The midget sings a drunken rendition of "Lucky Lindy".
112346: Old Man River keeps on rolling along.
112378: You begin to sweat, and your muscles strain, as if in anticipation of
some impending physical activity.
112472: Your body is aching and wracked with pain. Your stomach is content.
112572: The midget jumps to the ground as you tilt the bale upwards, and looks
you over with a queasy eye as you lift it into your capacious inventory.
112690: The midget squeals drunkenly as you lift him, and you suddenly feel a
heavy hand on your shoulder. You turn to face the stern, mustached visage of
Riverville's finest, Police Captain Mickey O'Cop.
112836: "Well, well," he says in a rich brogue. "What have we here? A violator
of local bylaw 523.5, by the looks a' it. Here in Rivertown, you know, we have
a local sayin': ya gets a little drunk, and ya lands in jail!"
112998: You are hauled off in a paddy wagon, and find yourself...
113058: The cell is dark and lonely, and would be darker and lonelier were it
not for the rays of moonlight and the sound of water lapping against a nearby
riverbank, both of which come your way through the barred window above you. The
steel cell door to the north, barely visible in the dim light, is closed and
locked from the outside.
113304: You feel weary and sick of trying. Tired of living, but scared of
dying. Your stomach is content.
113404: Standing on your tiptoes, you look through the bars to see Old Man
River and the sleepy, moonlit town of Riverville.
113514: Old Man River, he just keeps rolling along.
113718: mcom/devel/if/gtv/). This is my entry into the 2000 IF Competition;
it's the first time I've entered the competition.
113814: I wrote the sort of game I like to see in IF competitions. It's short,
it's replayable, it's funny (I hope), and it's got lots of neat things to play
with.
113934: There are five scenarios in this game, not counting the main scenario
in which you start. In any given game, you can visit between zero and four of
the scenarios (2.72, on average). The scenarios are easy enough to beat (the
emphasis is more on atmosphere and exploration than on puzzle-solving), so you
should finish in less than the allotted two hours. I'm making the gamble that
you'll find the game fun enough that when you complete it, you'll want to play
it again and catch some of the scenarios you missed the first time. If not,
then at least I've saved you some time. It's a win-win situation.
114364: I encourage you to use the hints and/or walkthrough if you get stuck. I
know full well that I merely invite disaster upon my head by designing my first
game around the experience of poorly-designed games. (In particular, it's
possible to put the game into a dead-end state. If this keeps happening to you,
you might find helpful the second section of the walkthrough, or the hint
options dealing with your inventory.)
114654: A walkthrough is of limited value in this game, because of its random
aspects, but I can help you out if for some reason you just want to see one of
the endings to this turkey.
114780: Be warned that the following text will tell you exactly how to beat
every single puzzle in this game, except for the two Easter egg puzzles. So use
it if you're stuck, but first make sure that you really are stuck. Use the
hints before turning to the walkthrough.
114978: You start at the booth with a tarnished quarter. The goal is to pay
Lalrry, the booth's proprietor, so you can play his game. Unfortunately, Lalrry
is a fairly literal-minded fellow, and won't hear of anything but a shiny
quarter. Polishing the quarter does no good, and the quarter-shining machine to
the northeast won't work without two quarters. So go southeast, behind the
booths, and see what's there.
115270: That box looks suspicious. Almost as though someone put it there as
part of a puzzle. Experiment with the switches and Lalrry, and you'll find that
the switches affect the way Lalrry interacts with the world. The orange switch
causes him not to see or use nouns, and the blue switch causes him not to see
or use adjectives. You want him to accept your tarnished quarter, so flip the
blue switch and he'll accept anything that's a "quarter" as payment. Go
northeast and give the quarter to Lalrry. You might want to go back and flip
the blue switch again so you'll be able to understand what he's saying.
115696: Anyway, now that you've paid Lalrry, you get to Guess The Verb! Pick a
verb at random and GUESS [VERB]. If you guess it right, you get a tacky prize
and you get to spin again. If you guess wrong, you get sucked into (an
alternate universe?) (a fantasy world?) (a hallucination?) in which the verb
that showed up on the wheel is somehow essential to success.
115976: This version has five verbs, and therefore five verb scenarios, so the
walkthrough bifurcates in a bit. Before that, a few notes about your inventory.
116312: quarter", which you can take into the carnival scenario and use to
purchase another spin of the wheel. This is less confusing than it sounds. Just
take everything not nailed down, in classic text adventure style, and you'll be
okay.
116478: With that in mind, let's tackle the scenarios, in rough order of
increasing complexity.
116574: Not much to do here. WAIT a while, maybe talk to the computer. Be sure
to go OUT and GET THE SANDWICH QUARTER from the catering tray--it's your ticket
to another round of verb-guessing. WAIT until the airlock opens and then go
DOWN.
116766: It will come as an unpleasant surprise to you at this point that EXIT,
OUT and similar commands don't work. What kind of lousy game is this? No
worries--just DISEMBARK and your adventure will begin. More precisely, your
adventure will end--you'll find yourself back at the carnival.
117008: This is the only scenario with a time limit (about 20 turns). You have
to get the right kind of coffee for Dr. Prugrave before his monster comes to
life. The Bean-Wrangler 600 is a foreboding device, but never underestimate the
power of a well-chosen verb. SCRUTINIZE MACHINE and you'll find out the number
of the button to push. PUSH [NUMBER] to get the coffee. GIVE COFFEE TO DOCTOR
and the scenario will end... just in time!
117632: WAIT around there to see if anyone there has a similar problem. Put
your faith in the all-powerful verb, type RECONFIGURE FIRE, and you're suddenly
a system administration expert! Your triumph is short-lived, however, as you
are immediately moved back to the carnival.
118266: Okay, this one is quite complicated. It's not even strictly a
guess-the-verb problem, as you might have guessed from the fact that its "verb"
is UNDO. This a learn-through-dying problem; to win, you need to know which of
four strategies will be successful against the warlock, but you can't find out
which one without going into his study, whereupon he kills you.
118530: So go east and then UNDO one move. Make a note of what the warlock
said. You'll need to have three spells memorized (funyun, formic, and either
bismol or foobar), and you'll also need to have either the obnoxious parrot or
a demon friend.
118706: To get the obnoxious parrot, you MEMORIZE GEORDI and GEORDI PARROT. To
get the demon, you MEMORIZE AWKGREP and CAST AWKGREP.
118832: You can only carry around three spells at once, so memorize funyun and
formic, memorize and cast geordi or awkgrep, and then memorize bismol or
foobar. With your parrot or your demon, and your three spells, you're ready for
battle.
118996: Go east again. As before, the spell Do'papoc casts against you will
fail on a technicality, and he'll immediately begin memorizing another one.
Now's the time to FUNYUN WARLOCK. He'll memorize the wrong spell--a spell that
gets rid of the parrot or the demon (depending on whether you had to learn
geordi or awkgrep).
119232: Now he's mad. He'll summon either a goblin or a horde of rats. Your
response should be to BISMOL GOBLIN or to FUNYUN RATS.
119338: In the final round, the gloves come off. Do'papoc will summon a beefy
warrior to do his dirty work for him. FORMIC WARRIOR and you win.
119808: mcom). Thanks to Adam Kaplan, Frederick Lee, Dan Helfman, and Mark
Fasheh for allowing me to simulate them. And finally, thanks to those who have
come before, providing me with the raw material for my little pastiche.
119968: This game is written using Inform version 6. Portions make use of
hacked versions of the spellcasting system from Graham Nelson's example game
120080: and title bar code from the Inform manual. The hint system was
generated with the help of Nelson's Infoclues program. I take, take, take from
Nelson, and what do I give in return?
120344: and use portions in your own games without any restrictions. Any public
modifications to and bug fixes for this game should be channeled through me.
120446: Have you tried....
120466: Finding a way to actually get killed in a scenario?
120506: Figuring out how scenario changes affect your inventory?
120550: Showing everything to everyone?
120576: Playing as a member of the other gender?
120606: Finding amusing bugs in this turkey that I didn't catch?
120888: Listening to the doctor's whole speech?
120920: Pushing different buttons to get various kinds of coffee?
120982: Figuring out what synthebeast is made of?
121016: Trying to figure out the unprovided backstory for this scenario?
121064: Asking the computer about various features of the ship?
121176: Learning the perlsed spell in the first place?
121256: Casting geordi on the snail, rubber alien, and/or plush frog?
121304: Stay tuned for my next game, the Trofim Lysenko Cave Crawl! Here's a
thrilling sneak preview:
121392: A stream heads from north to south here, burbling along. Strange, white
fish blink their useless eyes at the light of your lantern. Everywhere is the
drip...drip...drip of water on rock.
121528: A little dwarf is in the room with you, brandishing a nasty looking
knife!
121706: The dwarf's papers on genetics are struck from circulation as he is
escorted away to continue his agricultural research in northern Siberia.
121852: You're trying to have some fun before your parents rejoin you.
121896: That's it.
121908: Eventually, you might be concerned with surviving.
121944: AH HA HA HA HA!
121964: Listen to his pitch.
121980: He keeps repeating the same stuff over and over.
122016: He's not a very flexible parser.
122040: He's probably programmed to do a match on "shiny quarter" when
accepting payment for the game.
122108: Your quarter is tarnished, not shiny.
122136: So Lalrry doesn't think he can accept it as payment.
122176: You need to use the quarter shining machine on the midway.
122220: It costs a quarter.
122236: But you only have the one quarter.
122260: In fact, at any given point in the game you will have at most one
quarter.
122312: Lalrry won't accept your quarter because it doesn't match "shiny
quarter".
122368: You can't change the appearance of your quarter.
122404: Maybe you could change the way Lalrry perceives your quarter.
122448: Have you been behind the tent?
122472: There's a box there with two switches.
122500: If you flip both switches, Lalrry freezes up.
122536: What happens if you only flip one?
122560: See what effect they have on Lalrry's pitch.
122592: Show him things and see how he reacts.
122620: The next hints will explicitly give away the puzzle.
122656: The settings on the box affects how Lalrry interacts with the world.
122704: The left switch (roughly) prevents him from seeing or using adjectives.
122756: The right switch (roughly) prevents him from seeing or using nouns.
122804: If you flip the left switch, Lalrry will accept any kind of quarter as
payment.
122860: If you flip the right switch, Lalrry will accept anything shiny as
payment.
122916: Flip the right switch. Give Lalrry the tarnished quarter.
122960: You can now guess the verb of your choice.
122992: No.
122996: You just had a streak of good luck.
123024: Or maybe you're expanding every single hint to see what it says.
123072: Try restarting the game and playing again.
123102: What am I trying to do?
     Why won't Lalrry accept my quarter?
    
How can I shine my tarnished quarter?
     So how do I get to play the game?
  
  So I win every time, is that your little game?
123272: What am I trying to do?
123292: Why won't Lalrry accept my quarter?
123320: How can I shine my tarnished quarter?
123348: So how do I get to play the game?
123372: So I win every time, is that your little game?
123408: I don't know.
123420: The game is deliberately vague on exactly what happens here.
123464: At any rate, there you are.
123484: But you just got here!
123500: Oh, all right.
123512: See the hints for the specific scenario you're in.
123548: In general, you need to use the verb that showed up on the wheel.
123596: You have a scenario-specific version of your previous inventory.
123644: You've got a bracelet-type item.
123668: If you had the corn dog, you've also got a food item of some sort.
123716: You'll also have any prizes you won from Lalrry.
123752: You'll also have any items you took out of previous scenarios.
123796: Obviously, you'll have them only if they were in your inventory before.
If you dropped them, you won't have them when you enter the scenario.
123896: When you complete a scenario, your inventory changes again.
123940: You get the stuff you had before entering the scenario, assuming you
still have its scenario counterpart.
124012: You might also have additional items, taken from the scenario.
124056: Unfortunately, such items are often not as interesting as they were in
the scenario.
124116: What happened?
     How can I escape?
     What happpened to my
inventory?
     What will happen to my inventory in the future?
124236: What happened?
124248: How can I escape?
124264: What happpened to my inventory?
124288: What will happen to my inventory in the future?
124324: You're trying to dock at a space station.
124356: The computer is negotiating a docking.
124384: Maybe something you can do would help.
124412: Is the airlock open?
124428: Are you in the airlock?
124448: Can't disembark, huh?
124468: Did you try DISEMBARK?
124492: Obviously not, since DISEMBARK works.
124528: So why did I phrase that as a question?
124556: Because it was a rhetorical question.
124584: You don't know.
124596: You'll find out later in the game.
124624: Or you would, if this were a full game and not just a scenario.
124668: What makes you think that?
124688: Oh, the DIAGNOSE message. Right.
124720: While I think that would be a cool plot twist, that doesn't happen in
this scenario.
124780: That message is just for atmosphere.
124808: What's going on?
     I can't leave the ship!
     Where are my
parents?
     Is this the sort of game where hostile symbionts infect my body?
124932: What's going on?
124948: I can't leave the ship!
124968: Where are my parents?
124984: Is this the sort of game where hostile symbionts infect my body?
125028: He's just doing his job.
125048: His job is to protest Dr. Prugrave's insane plans.
125088: It's good work if you can get it.
125112: He's preparing to activate his monster.
125140: The monster's purpose is to destroy those who cheese the doctor off.
125188: Now might be a good time to get on Dr. Prugrave's good side.
125232: Maybe by getting him the coffee he's asking for.
125268: You're not strong enough to stop him.
125296: You can't.
125308: Don't feel bad.
125320: It's Ernie's job to stop him, and even he can't do it.
125364: Maybe if you did your job, you wouldn't die.
125396: Push a button.
125408: Oh, you want to know which button?
125436: If you bought the game, you should be able to find the answer in your
Bean-Wrangler 600 manual.
125508: If you didn't buy the game, you're a no-good software pirate who
doesn't deserve to be helped.
125576: Oh, all right.
125588: Have you looked at the machine?
125612: Have you looked at it very closely?
125640: Have you scrutinized it?
125660: Have you SCRUTINIZED it?
125688: If you had, it'd tell you which button to push.
125724: Push the appropriate button.
125744: It's of no use inside the scenario.
125772: It's for giving to Lalrry later so that you can guess another verb.
125820: What is Ernie doing?
     What is Dr. Prugrave doing?
     How can I
stop Dr. Prugrave?
     I keep dying!
     I can't work the coffeemaker!
     I
don't know which button to push!
     What is the stone for?
126000: What is Ernie doing?
126016: What is Dr. Prugrave doing?
126040: How can I stop Dr. Prugrave?
126064: I keep dying!
126076: I can't work the coffeemaker!
126100: I don't know which button to push!
126128: What is the stone for?
126144: Fred is in sysadmin panic mode.
126168: Fire's nameserver configuration is shot to heck.
126204: That's a good question.
126224: Whatever it is that Mark usually does.
126252: Dan is working on his game, Hover Carnage.
126324: He is also complaining about things.
126352: Show him a thing and he will complain.
126380: Amazing, no?
126392: No?
126396: Sensa is busy sensing electromagnetic fields.
126428: That Sensa! Pure scamp!
126448: To have more fun with Sensa, play Suspended.
126484: Why not ask him?
126496: ASK LEONARD ABOUT WHAT HE'S DOING.
126540: Classified, eh? A whack to the head might "declassify" something
useful.
126596: Okay, that didn't work.
126616: Leonard is writing an incredible game called "Guess The Verb!" which is
destined to get 11th place in the 2000 Interactive Fiction Competition.
126724: He will choose as his prize a New Zork Times puzzle winner T-shirt,
which he will give to his girlfriend as a Christmas present.
126816: Of course, he doesn't yet know about any of this.
126852: Adam is trying to design a circuit, but is continually foiled by the
lameness of the circuit design software.
126928: John Ying and Leonard are supposed to be helping him, but they're
nowhere to be seen.
126992: The man needs caffeine!
127012: Can't you see he's a-jonesin' real bad?
127044: There are a couple sources of caffeine in the game.
127080: One is the chocolate in the donut (assuming you have the donut).
127128: A better one is the soda avaliable in the SEAS Cafe.
127168: You need a shiny quarter.
127188: But the quarter you have is tarnished.
127216: Wait... never mind.
127232: You need at least eighty cents.
127256: If you manage to solve fire's problem, Fred might reward you with the
neccessary funds.
127320: Probably not, though. He's a tightwad.
127352: He even brings his lunch to school every day.
127384: Actually his mom packs a lunch for him.
127412: Now that I've embarrassed Fred, I can tell you that there's no way to
buy the soda.
127476: It's a puzzle that was put in to make this scenario look like a small
part of a larger game.
127540: What good, indeed!
127556: You can get a funny message if you show it to Fred.
127592: You can get a funny message if you show it to anybody, but I'm singling
out the Fred message because Suzanne Britton, who otherwise did not care for
this game, said in her review of it that she thought that message was funny.
127752: So it must have something going for it.
127780: I personally prefer the Adam message, but it's probably not as funny as
Fred's if you've never met Adam.
127856: Uh, anyway.
127868: See the section on your inventory for possible uses of the paperclip.
127916: They are the score for the LUG's game of Make Dan Complain.
128020: Think about what you just said.
128044: Think real hard.
128056: Think about the Second Incompleteness Theorem.
128092: It won't help, but I think that's a really cool theorem.
128136: I believe you prove it by showing that if a consistency proof exists in
a consistent system, then one with a smaller Godel number must also exist in
that system, and that inductively a proof of zero length must exist, which is
impossible.
128300: I remember proving it that way, but it's been a while.
128340: Anyway, if you think long enough about the question "How do I
reconfigure fire?", the answer will come to you.
128420: But if you want me to, I'll spell it out.
128452: In fact, I already did.
128472: RECONFIGURE FIRE.
128496: What makes you think they need reconfiguration?
128530: What is Fred doing?
     What is Mark doing?
     What is Dan doing?
  
  What is Sensa doing?
     What is Leonard doing?
     What is Adam doing?
   
 How can I help Adam?
     How do I buy the soda?
     What good is the
paperclip?
     What do the numbers on the whiteboard mean?
     How do I
reconfigure fire?
     How do I reconfigure the other machines?
128824: What is Fred doing?
128840: What is Mark doing?
128856: What is Dan doing?
128872: What is Sensa doing?
128888: What is Leonard doing?
128908: What is Adam doing?
128924: How can I help Adam?
128940: How do I buy the soda?
128960: What good is the paperclip?
128980: What do the numbers on the whiteboard mean?
129012: How do I reconfigure fire?
129032: How do I reconfigure the other machines?
129064: Do you always think of people in terms of what good they are to you?
129112: He's good for companionship.
129136: He's got some tools that may prove useful.
129168: He knows quite a bit about the caves.
129196: You can learn a lot from him.
129220: But he's mostly there for atmosphere.
129248: A rope might be useful.
129268: Duran has a rope.
129284: But he can't seem to attach it to that hook.
129316: Why don't you give it a try?
129340: Wait until he says "I'll figure it out." and begins to pace around.
129392: TIE ROPE TO HOOK.
129416: Oops.
129424: PUT ROPE ON HOOK.
129448: Nope.
129456: Is there another way you might phrase that command?
129492: Maybe another verb might work.
129516: How about the one that showed up on the wheel?
129548: FASTEN ROPE TO HOOK.
129576: No one knows.
129588: Not even the author.
129604: He did it as a joke.
129672: show "Hogan's Heroes".
129692: That's an interesting question.
129716: They give you points.
129732: What makes you think you can?
129756: Maybe it's just there for atmosphere.
129784: Actually, you can get there.
129808: But that's one of the easter egg puzzles, and as such the solution will
not be revealed in the hints.
129880: What good is Duran?
     What is the tour guide for?
     How do I get
down the cliff?
     What is the significance of the number 13?
     What good
are the treasures?
     How can I get to the bridge?
130048: What good is Duran?
130064: What is the tour guide for?
130084: How do I get down the cliff?
130108: What is the significance of the number 13?
130140: What good are the treasures?
130160: How can I get to the bridge?
130184: You're near the end of a game.
130208: You have overcome many hardships with your book of spells and
conveniently placed clues.
130268: Most of them have already been used to solve puzzles.
130308: The quarter is so you'll have something to pay Lalrry with after you
beat this scenario.
130372: The bag of cookies can be used as a spell component for the perlsed
spell.
130424: You may need the parrot to finish the scenario.
130460: You can't. It's too complicated for you to learn.
130500: You can't. It's too complicated for you to learn.
130540: Actually, you can get it.
130560: This is one of the easter egg puzzles, and as such its solution will
not be revealed here.
130624: Geez, what am I, your hint system or something?
130660: Oh.
130664: Have you looked into why you keep dying?
130692: The jawbreaker thing, right.
130716: Maybe you could prevent him from casting that spell.
130752: Like causing him to cast another spell.
130780: Like casting funyun on him.
130800: Okay, that didn't work.
130820: Starting to get the picture?
130840: This puzzle is completely unfair.
130864: Fortunately, Do'papoc gives you a hint in his little speech.
130908: In fact, he tells you exactly how to kill him.
130944: You need a slate of three spells and a companion of some sort.
130988: Unfortunately, you can't benefit from this information because on the
next turn you die.
131052: Thus, the name of this scenario.
131076: Get the information, write it down, and then UNDO.
131116: Equip yourself, go back into the study, and kill Do'Papoc.
131160: You have a parrot, but it's not particularily obnoxious.
131200: You need the sorghum spell, "Make non-obnoxious object obnoxious."
131252: Alternatively, you could cast geordi on the parrot to make it come to
life.
131304: Cast funyun on the warlock.
131324: You need to have Tim or the parrot around to absorb the brunt of the
spell Do'Papoc will learn instead of brussel.
131404: Cast foobar on them.
131420: The rats will turn on each other.
131444: Cast bismol on him.
131460: He will flee.
131472: Whatever you do, don't cast formic on him.
131504: Cast formic on him.
131520: His mother will take care of both him and Do'Papoc.
131560: Have you tried scrubbing them out?
131584: You need the new, improved lemfresh spell!
131616: Nothing gets stains out like lemfresh!
131644: For whiter whites, brighter brights, it's lemfresh!
131684: Caution: continued use of lemfresh spell may cause dogs to explode.
131732: No, it wasn't.
131744: But when I played Enchanter a while back I was really annoyed by the
nature of the final puzzle, so when the time came for me to write my own game,
I dedicated my acid cursor to the topic of retaliation.
131888: Yes, I consider it a good use of my time to mock a seventeen-year-old
text adventure.
131950: What's going on?
     What are all these items for?
     How do I get
the lexyacc spell?
     How do I get the perlsed spell?
     I keep dying!
    
How do I get a demonic companion?
     Where is the obnoxious parrot?
     How
do I keep from being turned into jawbreakers?
     How do I get rid of the
rats?
     How do I get rid of the goblin?
     How do I get rid of the
warrior?
     How do I get rid of unsightly grass stains?
     This wasn't
really a guess-the-verb puzzle, was it?
132328: What's going on?
132344: What are all these items for?
132368: How do I get the lexyacc spell?
132392: How do I get the perlsed spell?
132416: I keep dying!
132428: How do I get a demonic companion?
132452: Where is the obnoxious parrot?
132476: How do I keep from being turned into jawbreakers?
132512: How do I get rid of the rats?
132536: How do I get rid of the goblin?
132560: How do I get rid of the warrior?
132584: How do I get rid of unsightly grass stains?
132616: This wasn't really a guess-the-verb puzzle, was it?
132944: A white plastic embarassment which your parents make you wear on those
rare occasions on which you are allowed off on your own. In little red letters
just above your wrist, it says "My name is
133080: . In case of emergency, call my mother's cell phone at (
133124: You can't. It appears to be cursed.
133152: The corn dog is a curious creature. Its life cycle begins when the
larval corn dog is cooked and put on a stick. The corn dog is dipped in batter
to form a cocoon and fried. Inside the batter cocoon, the baby corn dog
metamorphoses into an adult phase which is then purchased, slathered with
mustard, and eaten. The rumbling of your stomach tells you that the end is near
for this particular corn dog. We will miss you, corn dog.
133452: Most features of the coin are obscured by scratches and tarnish.
Washington stares stoically off into space as you hold the quarter between
thumb and forefinger.
133564: Your valiant attempt fails to noticeably improve the quarter's looks.
133612: A green and yellow plush copyright violation: a cartoon frog wearing a
top hat.
133776: A fuzzy plush top hat sitting atop the head of the fuzzy plush frog.
133824: A long rope of red licorice.
133844: You slurp down the red licorice. Not very tasty.
133880: Even if the licorice rope held, which it wouldn't, it's much too short
to reach the cave bottom.
133948: A rubber alien with googly eyes. Squeezing it produces a squeak.
133996: The rubber alien briefly vibrates, and issues a hideous "SQUEAK!", but
then lies still. It must not be a simulacrum of any existing animal.
134120: a batteries. The battery compartment is
134148: Nothing happens. There must be no batteries.
134180: You open the battery compartment, revealing no batteries.
134220: You close the battery compartment.
134280: The compartment will hold only batteries.
134312: A newly minted millennial Canadian quarter. You're not sure how you
ended up with it.
134376: A sixth-grade spelling book, with lists of words and definitions. Words
that are spelled oddly--one or two per lesson--are for some reason given the
name of 'snurks'. You're not really sure how you ended up with the book.
134536: Words like "through" and "knight" are snurks.
134572: A sugar-packed Buttertonsils bar, in its characteristic golden wrapper.
You're not sure how you got ahold of it, but they're not bad.
134668: The candy bar slides down your throat, and your stomach quickly is
full.
134720: The cramped, brightly-lit booth before which you stand is the field of
play for a carnival game with the improbable name of "Guess The Verb". Lalrry,
the
134980: The rest of the carnival midway lies to the northeast, and you can
scamper behind the booth to the southeast.
135104: You hear only the sounds of the midway.
135132: You hear Lalrry's mechanical buzzings and clickings, not to mention his
boisterous speech.
135196: The Guess the Verb booth is small and liberally stocked with stuffed
animals, gewgaws, jimcracks, heehaws, and spistacks, all intended as prizes for
successful guessers of the verb. A large wheel
135360: , and it is to this wheel that your friend the parser gestures quite
emphatically. One might even say spastically. "Spastically." There, I said it
135468: The prizes are a motley lot. Large plush copyright-infringing Looney
Tunes dolls, big stupid foam hats, ropes of red licorice, goofy feather boas,
sensible shoes (not the most popular prize), porcelain puppies, souvenir
ashtrays that say "Put Your Butt Here", isinglass curtains that roll right
down, et cetera.
135692: It takes a certain lack of perspective to steal carnival prizes.
135796: A sort of rotating pie chart, the wheel of fortune is about four feet
in diameter and attached to a frame which, in turn, is bolted to the side of
the booth. A plastic red arrow suspended over the top of the wheel indicates
136172: "I love that little!", Lalrry confides in you. "Always makes laugh!"
136226: "I love that guy!", Lalrry confides in you. "He always makes me laugh!"
136284: "I love that little guy!", Lalrry confides in you. "He always makes me
laugh!"
136402: slightly suspicious of your frequent wins, but he hands you your prize
anyway. It's an squeezable rubber alien.
136608: " I've got to get now--no use hanging around after the verbs are. I
hope you had fun."
136672: Lalrry shrugs and says "Guess that's! 'Ve got to get going now--no use
hanging around after all the are gone. Hope had."
136764: "Sorry!", says Lalrry with a shrug. "I guess that's it! I've got to get
going now--no use hanging around after all the verbs are gone. I hope you had
fun."
136880: Lallry begins slowly, methodically dismantling the empty wheel. You
stand and watch him for a while, an awkward figure working gracefully in
silence. Then you turn away and slowly walk into the humid night,
137028: "Sorry!", says Lalrry with a shrug. "Better luck next!"
137072: Lalrry shrugs and says "Luck next time!"
137104: "Sorry!", says Lalrry with a shrug. "Better luck next time!"
137152: And a man is about to flip a switch.
137180: And a little dwarf is in the room with you.
137214: You shrug too, and try to look nonchalant, but you feel a hollowness in
the pit in your stomach which is something more than simple disappointment. The
lights of the midway seem uncomfortably close, the music incessant and loud.
You wonder if you aren't coming down with something, and blink to clear the
glare from your eyes.
137444: You claw at the air, then at the unidentifiable blurs that race past
you, then at your own body, which is unaccountably absent from this mad scene.
You open your hypothetical mouth and emit a potential scream which never quite
materializes, and then with the feeling of suddenly waking up from a nightmare,
you are somewhere else.
137674: You close your eyes and brace yourself for the fall you feel is
inevitable. It isn't until your body fades away, leaving your consciousness
without any eyelids to shield it, that you realize that you have been falling
for quite a while. Before you have time to get properly panicked again, though,
you are somewhere else.
137900: You watch, only slightly disconcerted, as the fairgrounds waver and
fade away. You fall, but the fall is no longer frightening; it is exhilarating.
All the same, it is worrying just how far you are falling--it seems much longer
than last time--just as you begin to wonder whether something has gone wrong,
you are somewhere else.
138134: As your body fades away, you watch the fairgrounds do the same. Now
that you know what to expect, the fall is quite thrilling--like a roller
coaster a hundred times more exciting and dangerous than the rather dull
caterpillar ride you almost spent fifty cents on. Before you can really start
to enjoy and explore this feeling of noncorporeality, though, you are somewhere
else.
138398: As the fairgrounds dissolve beneath you, you suddenly realize that they
are getting smaller as well.
138472: You effortlessly soar upwards without any conscious control or
expenditure of energy. The starscape looms ever closer, then abruptly
disappears. You are somewhere else.
139170: o answer queries and to help people find treasures and kill trolls.
Nowadays, most parsers are working at Web start-ups. The fact that Lalrry is
working as a carnival barker does not say much for his language handling
capabilities.
139332: In fact, at the moment he doesn't seem to be functioning at all. He
stands statuelike, frozen in mid-gesture.
139412: Lalrry is much too heavy to carry.
139436: I suppose you think you can guess a verb when you're not in the
vicinity of a verb guessing booth.
139504: Lalrry doesn't seem to hear your guess.
139532: "Sorry, that's not on the wheel!"
139560: "Sorry," says Lalrry, "but I need a shiny from before can GUESS THE!"
139620: "But I need a quarter from you before you can GUESS THE VERB!",
stutters Lalrry suddenly.
139696: "Sorry," says Lalrry, "but I need a shiny quarter from you before you
can GUESS THE VERB!"
139772: "Hey, guess! And so I spin the wheel..."
139808: "Hey, good guess! And so I spin the wheel..."
139846: Lalrry gives the wheel a good push and it begins rapidly rotating,
spinning faster now, now slowly winding down until it...stops...on...
139952: Lalrry is in no condition to respond.
139980: "It's you who should be GUESSING THE VERB!"
140024: "It's you who should be GUESSING THE VERB!"
140068: "You have to GUESS THE VERB before I can spin the wheel!"
140120: "Have to GUESS THE before can spin the!"
140156: "You have to GUESS THE VERB before I can spin the wheel!"
140208: "But I need a quarter from you before you can GUESS THE VERB!"
140264: "Sorry, but need a shiny from before can GUESS THE!"
140308: "Sorry, but I need a shiny quarter from you before you can GUESS THE
VERB!"
140372: "I don't understand," says Lalrry.
140400: "I don't understand," says Lalrry.
140468: "I'd rather not, right now," says Lalrry confusedly.
140508: But Lallry cannot defend himself!
140532: But Lalrry only wants to be your friend!
140564: You sneak a kiss, and feel strangely unfulfilled.
140600: Human-natural language parser relationships inevitably end in
heartbreak. Best not to get one started.
140708: "Oh, I've been," says Lalrry, although he does not enlighten you with
what he's been.
140772: "Oh, 've been around," says Lalrry.
140804: "Oh, I've been around," says Lalrry.
140836: "GUESS THE VERB is the game ever!" says Lalrry.
140880: "GUESS THE is the best ever!" says Lalrry sincerely.
140924: "GUESS THE VERB is the best game ever!" He seems to really believe it.
140984: "Was a true," says Lalrry enigmatically.
141016: "Lazarus was a friend," Lalrry says simply.
141052: "I don't think I'm programmed to respond to that," says Lalrry sadly.
141152: "I don't think I'm programmed to respond to that question," says Lalrry
sadly.
141212: Lalrry's eyes light up, despite the fact that this is impossible.
"Wow!", he says, trying to sound nonchalant. "You could GUESS THE VERB with
that quarter!"
141336: "Yuck!", says Larry. "A tarnished!"
141456: Lalrry's eyes light up, despite the fact that this is impossible.
"Wow!", he says, trying to sound nonchalant. "You could GUESS THE VERB with
that quarter!"
141580: "How are, eh?", says Larry to the quarter. "Went to once on! Got some
maple!"
141644: "Sorry," says Lalrry. "American currency only."
141684: Lalrry's eyes light up, despite the fact that this is impossible.
"Wow!", he says, trying to sound nonchalant. "Could really GUESS THE with that
shiny!"
141804: "A paperclip," says Lalrry absently.
141832: "It's a paperclip," says Lalrry absently.
141864: Lalrry's eyes light up, despite the fact that this is impossible.
"Wow!", he says, trying to sound nonchalant. "Could really GUESS THE with that
shiny!"
141984: "Trophy," says Lalrry, stating the obvious.
142020: "Nice trophy," says Lalrry. "I didn't know you were a bowler."
142072: Lalrry's eyes light up, despite the fact that this is impossible.
"Wow!", he says, trying to sound nonchalant. "Could really GUESS THE with that
shiny!"
142192: "It's a stone, I'm almost certain."
142224: Lalrry's eyes light up, despite the fact that this is impossible.
"Wow!", he says, trying to sound nonchalant. "You could GUESS THE VERB with
that quarter!"
142348: "No, thanks," says Lalrry. "I'm not hungry."
142388: "Wow, a dog!", says Lalrry. "What's its name?"
142428: "No thanks," says Lalrry. "I don't like corn dogs."
142472: "What a pretty bracelet!", says Lalrry.
142504: "Did your boyfriend give you that?"
142532: "Thanks, but I don't need to see your identity."
142572: "I'll be sure to remember that number," says Lalrry.
142612: "I hope you enjoy it," says Lalrry
142640: "Hope enjoy," says Lalrry enigmatically.
142672: "I hope you enjoy it," says Lalrry.
142736: Lalrry gladly takes the quarter from your outstretched palm. With the
flair of a showman, he tosses it into the air and catches it in his shirt
pocket. Stepping back, he indicates the wheel.
142868: [To guess a verb, use "GUESS [verb]"; for example, "GUESS DISLIKE"]
142944: "Yuck!", says Lalrry, rejecting your offer. "A tarnished!"
143040: ," he says, handing the coin back to you. "This is not a shiny
quarter."
143096: Lalrry gladly takes the quarter from your outstretched palm. With the
flair of a showman, he tosses it into the air and catches it in his shirt
pocket. Stepping back, he indicates the wheel.
143228: "I don't understand what you're trying to do," says Lalrry, rejecting
your offer.
143336: ," he says, handing the coin back to you. "I only take American
currency."
143392: Lalrry gladly takes the paperclip from your outstretched palm. With the
flair of a showman, he tosses it into the air and catches it in his shirt
pocket. Stepping back, he indicates the wheel.
143528: "What would I want with a paperclip?", asks Lalrry, puzzled.
143576: "What would I want with a shiny paperclip?", asks Lalrry, puzzled.
143628: Lalrry gladly takes the trophy from your outstretched hands. With the
flair of a showman, he tosses it into the air and fails to notice as it crashes
to the ground inside the booth. Stepping back, Lalrry indicates the wheel.
143784: "You earned that trophy, you should keep it," says Lalrry.
143828: "I didn't know you were a bowler!", says Lalrry. "You earned that
trophy, you should keep it."
143900: Lalrry gladly takes the small stone from your outstretched palm. With
the flair of a showman, he tosses it into the air and catches it in his shirt
pocket. Stepping back, he indicates the wheel.
144036: "That's a nice stone," says Lalrry. "You should keep it."
144084: "That's a pretty cool stone," says Lalrry. "You keep it."
144132: Lalrry gladly takes the sandwich quarter from your outstretched palm.
With the flair of a showman, he tosses it into the air and seems not to notice
as it splatters on the ground. Stepping back, Lalrry indicates the wheel.
144288: "I don't need to eat," says Lalrry. "You should eat that sandwich."
144340: "I don't need to eat," says Lalrry. "You should eat that little bitty
sandwich."
144404: "Earned, keep," says Lalrry enigmatically.
144440: Lalrry politely declines your offer.
144502: "Step up, step up!", says Lalrry with a touch of a stutter.
144550: "Step right up, step right up!", says Lalrry with perfectly synthesized
heartiness.
144614: "Come and GUESS THE VERB, folks! You won't believe your organs!"
144674: "Come and GUESS THE! Won't believe your sensory!"
144720: "Come and GUESS THE VERB, folks! You won't believe your sensory
organs!"
144784: "Quarter," mumbles Lalrry to himself. "One quarter..."
144830: "One shiny...", mumbles Lalrry to himself.
144868: "Quarter," mumbles Lalrry to himself. "One shiny quarter..." You don't
think he knows what the word means.
144950: "Fabulous verbs, fabulous prizes, fabulous fun!"
144990: "One shiny quarter gets you a spin of the wheel!"
145030: Lalrry makes a long speech which you can't understand at all.
145076: Lalrry makes some rather dubious claims about the beneficial effects of
his carnival game on malaria, food poisoning, and the common cold.
145172: Lalrry briefly pulls you aside.
145196: "The heads have guessed verbs at booth," he says confidentially. "The
Mum was on PARTITION, although the King would hear of nothing but JUMP--SAUTER,
rather, I should say." You nod in what you hope looks like agreement.
145368: "The crowned of have guessed at my," he says confidentially. "The Queen
was quite on, although the of would hear of but, rather, should say." You nod
in what you hope looks like agreement.
145504: "The crowned heads of Europe have guessed verbs at my booth," he says
confidentially. "The Queen Mum was quite keen on PARTITION, although the King
of France would hear of nothing but JUMP--SAUTER, rather, I should say."
Somehow you doubt this.
145694: Lalrry makes a long-winded, heartfelt speech which you can't understand
at all.
145754: Lalrry reminisces about a friend of his, a medical expert system named
Lazarus.
145814: Lalrry babbles a bit about some computer game or other.
145856: Lalrry tells you about the text adventure he's writing, to be titled
"Leisure Suit Lalrry".
145932: GUESS THE!", declares Lalrry, who apparently know what he means.
145984: "It's time to GUESS THE VERB!", declares Lalrry, although he offers no
evidence to back this up.
146064: As your fleshy eye momentarily catches Lalrry's roving, metallic one,
you suddenly become his most important (not to mention only) potential
customer. Lights flash on his status panel as he loads a new pitch into
extended memory.
146228: "Hello, little boy or girl!", bellows Lalrry in the alarming tone used
by adults who are trying to be friendly. "Wait a minute... are you a boy or a
girl? Are you a BOY or a GIRL?"
146368: "Type mismatch!", says Lalrry mournfully. "Are you a BOY or a GIRL?"
146644: very suspicious indeed of your conspicuous failure to misguess even one
of the verbs on his wheel. He searches the now-empty wheel, feeling it for
hidden weights. He checks his camera wires for flaws and hidden taps, and
briefly stoops into the back of the tent to look at something you can't see
146872: . Finally, convinced that nothing is amiss, but still very suspicious,
he hands you your prize--a computerized chess game.

"I guess you've cleaned me
out," says Lalrry. "Enjoy it. I can't say that I envy you. I wish I'd had a
chance to--well, winning isn't everything, you know. I guess the game will
teach you that."

Lalrry looks dejected for a moment, then brightens.

"Well, I
gotta get moving, and your parents are probably looking for you. Take care,
147212: . Maybe I'll see you again sometime."
147244: Lalrry begins slowly, methodically, dismantling the empty wheel. As you
walk back towards the midway, clutching your prizes, you wonder what he meant.
Didn't you win every time? Didn't you get all the prizes? This frog is gonna
have some fun singing and dancing for your stuffed dinosaurs, that's for sure.
As for the chess game, it's about time you learned how to play. After all, how
hard can it be?
147536: Lalrry's straw hat has a red ribbon around it and is placed at a rakish
angle on one corner of his head. He probably thinks it gives him a dignified
appearance, but all it does is make him look less like a human and more like a
stylized hatrack
147736: The red ribbon circumnavigates Lalrry's straw hat.
147780: Lalrry's tie is a loud red-on-yellow affair which recalls school food.
147888: Lalrry's nametag reads "Hello! My name is LALRRY."
147932: The cable disappears down into the booth.
147964: The series of green lights flickers in a traffic flow monitoring sort
of way.
148020: The speaker is small, with a black mesh grille.
148056: The cameras are mounted on top of the Ethernet hub. Each can move
independently.
148116: A heavily modified Ethernet hub. Its effect is to give Lalrry a manic,
straight-across grin.
148184: You are in a shadowy alcove, surrounded by the canvas backs of several
carnival booths. The music and bustle of the midway seems very far away, and a
harvest moon illuminates the wet grass of the fairgrounds and the makeshift
walls that surround you.
148356: The light from the harvest moon seems magical tonight. If Neil Young
were here, he would undoubtedly write a song about it.
148444: The grass is Kentucky Bluegrass, a hardy variety well-suited to having
carnivals erected upon it. It is faintly wet.
148528: The canvas walls of the booths are constructed according to an ancient
carnival ritual involving a variety of swear words and a certain amount of duct
tape. They look a bit rickety, but they'll hold until the carnival moves on.
148684: The canvas walls give slightly to your touch.
148716: The cords run from either end of a metal box up into the booth.
148760: You can't pull the cords very far.
148788: The glinting tip of a small metal box peeks out from beneath the verb
guessing booth.
148846: The metal box is about the size of a deck of cards and is decorated
with black plastic trim. An LED and two switches (one orange, the other blue)
are mounted on the front of the box, and a cord runs from either end up into
the booth.
149016: Both switches are in the off position.
149044: Both switches are in the on position.
149100: The cords are connected to unknown things inside the booth. You can
pull the box away from the booth wall only about an inch before meeting
resistance.
149204: As you flip the switch, the LED suddenly goes dark.
149248: As you flip the switch, the LED suddenly lights up green.
149296: As you flip the switch, the LED suddenly lights up green.
149340: A small, round slot in the coin tray. It would just hold a quarter
149388: . In fact, it currently does hold a quarter
149420: That won't fit into a two-inch slit. It also won't fit into the coin
slot.
149476: Just more booths.
149492: Just more booths and rides.
149512: Just more booths.
149526: You head back to the Hall of Farming Implements, where a man in bib
overalls is demonstrating how milk yields can be improved considerably. You
reach for your mother's hand, and she squeezes yours.
149668: The lights and noise of the midway seem hollow and dull compared to the
aura of excitement you felt at the verb guessing booth. You survey the sights
around you as though through different eyes: the merry-go-round, the concession
stand--they seem so pedestrian now. You feel a strange attraction pulling you
back towards the southwest, as though a ham-handed author were trying to place
hints into the room description that the game would progress a lot faster if
you went back to the verb guessing booth already.

If you really want to,
though, you can go east to rejoin your parents and end the game.
150084: The dull lights cast their feeble, unexciting glow upon the midway.
150132: The merry-go-round does not seem as merry to you anymore.
150176: The concession stand offers a variety of deep-fried and/or sugary
items, for a price.
150236: You no longer have the money to spend on unhealthy food.
150276: The other machines aren't important.
150304: You can't help but notice a small but obtrusive quarter shining machine
squatting here.
150364: The quarter shining machine sits in the middle of a line of similar
machines which accept coins of smaller denomination, like pennies, and do more
interesting things to them, like smush them up and imprint them with touristy
slogans. In the face of such intense competition, the quarter shining machine
has taken to mimicry, hoping to trap unsuspecting coins intended for a less
boring (if also less shiny) fate in another machine.
150662: Its innards are exposed, an unnecessarily complicated mesh of shiny
gears and pistons. A prominent notice on the side of the machine assures you
with alarming urgency that the practice of quarter-shining is legal under
federal statute BH-2510958. The coin tray has two quarter-shaped slots; the
left one to contain payment and the right to contain the quarter you want
shined and dropped into the receptacle near the bottom of the machine.
150976: To put something into the machine, try, eg., PUT GUNKY QUARTER IN LEFT
COIN SLOT or PUT ASIAN ELEPHANT IN RIGHT COIN SLOT.
151104: It's a small, square receptacle, the output of the quarter shining
machine.
151160: That won't fit into a two-inch slit. Uh, I mean, it won't fit into the
receptacle.
151224: There's already something in the receptacle.
151256: The coin tray has two slots for quarters. The left one contains payment
for the shining service, the right contains the quarter to be shined.
151356: To put something on the tray, try, eg., PUT GUNKY QUARTER IN LEFT COIN
SLOT or PUT ASIAN ELEPHANT IN RIGHT COIN SLOT.
151480: You push the tray into the machine. When you let go of it, it pops back
out
151536: , payload intact. I don't want to seem intrusive, but you might want to
look into that empty coin slot.
151612: . Drawing upon my extensive experience in user interface design, I
think I can say with confidence that you should put quarters in the coin slot
if you want things to happen.
151732: At one time, you had a score, but Dr. Prugrave took it away to do
something with it and never gave it back.
151808: You are underfed but not tired. Your nerves are on edge from the
loudness of the chugging machines.
151878: As Dr. Prugrave pulls the breaker, the laboratory is momentarily
plunged into darkness. A sinusoidal hum accompanies the returning flicker of
the overhead lamps, and several metallic tools are pulled through the air to
impact with clanging noises upon the spinning electromagnets.

"At last," crows
the aged geologist, "my crowning achievement takes shape! At last, revenge will
be mine! My colleagues!"--he spits. "How they have tormented me these many
years! Now their torment will be my triumph!"

The mad doctor's laugh rends the
night. "Ernie!", he cries, pointing an accusing finger at his hunchbacked
assistant. "Ensure a constant flow of magnetotrons! And you,
152496: I don't know what you mean, old chap.
152524: Dr. Prugrave notices you trying to escape and fixes you with a steely
glare. You cautiously back away from the staircase.
152612: The loud, dull chugging of machines and motors.
152648: Dust. Lots of dust. It tickles your nose and keeps you constantly on
the verge of sneezing.
152716: The laboratory of Dr. Sapient Prugrave is a reflection of the man
himself: disorganized and loud. Insurance calendars and charts of the geologic
column hang from the walls; rocks, books, fossils, and tools litter every flat
surface. The layer of old
153004: The centerpiece of the laboratory is a large operating table, on which
lies a foreboding figure made of stone. A hulking coffeemaker stands against
one wall, and stairs lead upwards.
153132: Miscellaneous rocks and petrified wood. Most of it is only for
atmosphere, having been purchased at rock shops along Route 66.
153224: Reading material is scattered all around the room. There are books (to
name a couple:
153336: , by Dr. Piebald Hubris, mad obstetrician), technical journals (
153620: The fossils are mostly trilobites and tiny fish. There are a couple
dinosaur bones, but they're not much to look at.
153936: Old copies of the local newspaper, put on the floor to accumulate dust,
which task they accomplish admirably.
154012: Boring charts of the various time periods in Earth's geologic history.
Each is heavily annotated with "corrections" to bring them more into line with
Dr. Prugrave's rather unconventional theories.
154152: Most of the tools around the lab are currently stuck to one of the
electromagnets, but there remain some non-magnetic alloy hammers and chisels,
as well as a few ceramic items of unknown (to you, though presumably not to Dr.
Prugrave) purpose.
154324: The fluorescent lamps hang from the ceiling, casting a sterile light on
the bizarre scene below.
154428: Beyond noticing that the apparatus are in various states of chugging,
you cannot begin to fathom their function.
154508: As far as dust goes, it's fairly attractive. Originating from a
plethora of mundane, semi-precious and precious stones, it glitters and
sparkles in thick, multi-hued layers.
154632: The dust slips through your fingers.
154660: The heads of the hammers are apparently made out of some non-magnetic
alloy. All the handles are colored bright orange and labeled "Lab Depot". They
rest on a shelf well out of your reach.
154796: The chisels are sorted according to the atomic weight of the element
most dominant in their makeup. They rest on a shelf well out of your reach.
154896: Two electromagnets, covered in small metallic items from around the
lab, one on each side of the operating table. Both are attached to a motor that
rotates them at high speed, and each emits its own characteristic contralto
hum. The hums go in and out of phase with each other in a way that you find
extremely irritating. Dr. Prugrave is clearly a great believer in "magnet
power", if he thinks he can get his monster to come to life in this way.
155204: Apart from the fact that it has been structurally reinforced to
(barely) accommodate the weight of a crude three-ton granite statue of a man,
and the fact that said statue is currently occupying it, this is a completely
nondescript operating table.
155376: A rickety stairway leading up into Dr. Prugrave's house.
155420: Dr. Sapient Prugrave storms around the laboratory, lab coat flapping.
155470: He's mad, I tell you! MAD! In both senses of the word. He's clearly not
on this side of mental health, and he's also quite angry with you owing to your
unaccountable failure to get him his coffee. Not a good combination, by any
standard.

Madness aside, Dr. Prugrave does cut an impressive figure in his
starched lab coat (impeccably white despite the filth of his laboratory). His
bristly moustache, like his hair, retains only a little bit of black to offset
the grey; he's old, even for a grown-up. He carries a clipboard which he
glances at occasionally.

You can't say that you enjoy working for him, but at
least it's never boring.
155932: Dr. Prugrave is not a large man, but he's a lot bigger than you are,
and he's also used to fending off attacks from the you-sized Ernie. He easily
shakes you off his leg and dispatches you with a stream of invective and a blow
from his field clipboard.
156108: I can come to no other conclusion than that you're trying all sorts of
pointless things and hoping you'll get funny messages.
156196: It really might work better all around if you simply gave the coffee to
Dr. Prugrave.
156256: The utility of that action seems doubtful.
156288: Dr. Prugrave snatches the coffee from your upstretched hands, takes a
sip, and quickly spits it out. "Fools!", he roars. "Knaves! Idiots! I am
surrounded by! I ask for Mesozoic Sedimentary, and I am given
156696: ! Bah!"

In his fury, Dr. Prugrave flings the full cup of coffee onto
156772: , adding to the mess. "Do not fail me again!", he warns, shaking a
crooked finger in your face. You cower from the sight of his glowing eyes.
156874: Dr. Prugrave snatches the coffee from your upstretched hands, takes a
sip, and sighs. "Aaah," he says, contentedly. "The great taste of Mesozoic
Sedimentary."
156996: Suddenly there is a crunching sound from the table as the rocky figure
lurches upward into a sitting position. Ernie shrieks and pulls you behind one
of the electromagnets as the giant up in a shower of stone flakes. Its ruby
eyes burn with an unearthly light.
157176: Dr. Prugrave does not share Ernie's concern. In fact, for the first
time you can remember, he seems to be smiling. He beams at his creation over
the wax-paper cup in his hands, breathing the steam that rises from the coffee.
157338: "You know," he says, as his giant slowly flexes its granite fingers,
"This truly is a special moment."
157418: Unfortunately, the special moment does not last long. As you watch, the
monster silently turns and heads towards its creator, knocking trays and
equipment aside. You hear Ernie's gasp as the stone creature reaches for Dr.
Prugrave, and you shut your eyes in time to hear an anguished scream.
157628: "The stairs!" cries Ernie. "It's our only hope!" He leaps up and tries
to pull you along with him to the stairway, but you find yourself unable to
move. You are hypnotized by the motion of the spinning electromagnet, rotating
counterclockwise so fast that you see it as turning clockwise, ever so
slowly...like a wheel...

A wheel...
157872: Dr. Prugrave glares at you with caffeine-starved eyes.
157912: Dr. Prugrave glares at you with caffeine-starved eyes.
157952: Dr. Prugrave touches the face of his stone creation. "Soon," he
whispers. "Soon."
158016: "They laughed at my theory of tidal erosion! They belittled my studies
of Devonian river shales! They mocked my plan to build a super-race of
anthropomorphic rock-men! And now they will pay dearly for their mockery!"
158170: "For now I, Doctor Sapient Prugrave, will unleash this monstrosity of
my own design to seek out and to destroy those who called me mad!"
158272: "Master, I beseech you!" Ernie cries out in his high, tremulous voice.
"This whole destruction at the hands of your fiendish creation of those who
called you mad business--doesn't it just demonstrate to the world that you are
in fact mad?"
158444: "Silence, craven fool!" bellows Dr. Prugrave. "What know you of
madness? Only what you learned from me! The laughing and the vowing revenge and
the horribly impractical scheme bits! But my dance with Dame Madness is much
more intricate than you suspect or even dream!"
158638: Ernie cringes and screams as Dr. Prugrave brings down an imaginary whip
upon his back. Dr. Prugrave doesn't actually have a whip, being for some reason
too embarrassed to buy one, but neither employer nor henchman are willing to
forgo the traditional rituals of mad science.
158832: Having unleashed his anger, Dr. Prugrave grows quieter and more
reflective. "I blame my parents," he says. "If you tell a child not to put his
finger in the socket, does he not do it as soon as your back is turned?"
158988: "They wanted me to benefit humanity! They wanted me to expand the
frontiers of knowledge! So they sent me into geology, thinking a geologist
could never go mad! 'Whoever heard of a mad geologist?', they thought. And so I
went mad--just to show them!"
159170: "Master!", pleads Ernie, tugging at Dr. Prugrave's lab coat. "Listen to
the voice of reason!"
159334: ] "My life has been spent in the pursuit, the worship of Reason! To
stamp out those false idolaters who mock and jape at me from their positions of
power and tenure! Nay! Reason shall triumph, for I, Doctor Sapient Prugrave, am
the champion of Reason!"
159518: "A lonely life it is, Ernie. Scorned by those in power--because I hold
the truth! A truth they covet even as they spurn!"
159612: "And yet soon... how quickly that will change! When the whole globe
cowers before my magnetic monsters, how willingly they will acknowledge the
truth about certain Permian limestone deposits!"
159750: The whine of the electromagnets grows louder. Dr. Prugrave takes this
as a cue for a round of evil laughter.
159830: "Just imagine the look on their faces!" says Dr. Prugrave, apparently
doing so in great detail. "When they behold my army of rock-men, then will they
bow down to my measurements of oxygen isotopes trapped in igneous rocks!"
159992: The doctor seems lost in a fantasy world--more so than usual, I mean.
"And who will deny my grant applications, lest I cause the very earth to rise
up and smite them?" Ernie rolls his eyes; the two of you have heard this one
just a little too often.
160172: Again, Dr. Prugrave's attention turns to the supine statue on the
table, putative agent of his vengeance-by-proxy.
160256: "There he lies--my magnificent creation! Dead matter now, but in
moments, truly living rock!"
160326: "His heart is sandstone, his body granite, his eyes rubies, his mind a
perfect geode! He breathes sulphur, eats quartz, and magma flows through his
veins!"
160440: The figure on the operating table gives a sudden lurch. "Soon!", says
Dr. Prugrave. "Soon my creation will rise up and destroy!"
160538: "Master, this whole 'rise up and destroy' thing--I really must
protest!" Uncharacteristically, Dr. Prugrave ignores his assistant, preferring
to crow over his twitching creation.
160672: Suddenly there is a crunching sound from the table as the rocky figure
lurches upward into a sitting position. Ernie shrieks and pulls you behind one
of the electromagnets as the giant stands up in a shower of stone flakes. Its
ruby eyes burn with an unearthly light.
160858: "It lives!", shrieks Dr. Prugrave, throwing his hands up in triumph.
"It lives, and I am vindicated!"
160944: The creature lurches around, attracted to the pull of the
electromagnets, then notices you and Ernie huddling. With a grinding sound like
an avalanche, it begins to move toward you. Grabbing your arm, Ernie makes a
desperate run towards the staircase, but the creature is too fast, and too
powerful once it reaches you...
161172: A battered field clipboard with miscellaneous notes attached to it. You
looked at it once while Dr. Prugrave was on the phone, and couldn't understand
half the words on that thing.
161300: A starched, white lab coat with a mass of pens and pencils sticking out
of the breast pocket. Dr. Prugrave's coat always stays clean, which is quite a
mystery, as he wears it everywhere--even to go shopping.
161448: There are about 20 pens, pencils, and markers sticking out of Dr.
Prugrave's breast pocket, but there's nothing special about the pocket itself.
161552: Giveaway pens from booths at mad science conventions, mechanical
pencils from the general store, Magic Markers once used for labelling
plaster-covered fossils, clickable erasers. Possibly other stuff, but you've
never gotten a good look.
161720: Dr. Prugrave's moustache is like his hair in that it is bushy and
predominantly gray. It differs from his hair primarily in matters of size and
location.
161828: Unfortunately, Dr. Prugrave has veto power over anything you might
choose to do with his moustache.
161900: Ernie Gore, professional hunchback, wrings his hands as he trails his
pacing master.
161960: Although his extreme stoop brings him to about your height, Ernie is
much older than you. His working relationship with Dr. Prugrave predates your
birth. Your common oppression by the mad doctor has created a bond between you
and Ernie, and you consider him your best--not to mention only--friend.
162172: Ernie takes his duties very seriously, and is, as always, dressed in
his best rags. His pleas for sanity and mercy on his master's part are destined
to go forever unheard, but he doesn't mind. "That's the henchman business," he
always says. "I could have gone into public policy, but it would have been the
same thing."
162400: "As evil masters go, he's not bad. Sure, he works me hard, but I get
new rags and a bit of extra time off at the holidays, and he always asks after
the family. The whole rock angle is a bit over my head, but hey."
162552: "Bert has a first-class paperclip collection."
162588: "Doc's been working on that for years now."
162620: "I leave all that high-brain stuff to the master. I'm more of a
cringe-and-cower man."
162684: "You've been a great help to me. I'm not as young as I used to be, you
know! I hope you grow to like it here in time."
162772: "He lives three castles south of here. Decent fellow."
162812: "I'm afraid those have to stay on for now, at least until the master
trusts you a bit more."
162880: "Don't worry, that staircase is not as rickety as it looks. Better keep
off of it for now, though."
162952: "I'm not a big fan of watercolors of barns. But then, I've always
preferred the Impressionists."
163024: "I can never remember all that technical stuff. The coffeemaker manual
will answer all your questions."
163100: "Whatever you do, don't lose the manual. It's almost impossible to
operate the coffeemaker without it."
163176: "Not the healthiest breakfast, I know, but you'd better eat up. You
need your strength."
163244: "Study hard, and one day you too may be a great mad scientist."
163292: "You'd best keep that hidden before the master sees that you've swiped
it."
163348: "Not very good for you, I'm afraid."
163380: "Most mad scientists experiment on such creatures, but not Doc
Prugrave."
163436: "Never seen a real alien before."
163464: Busy with various henchman duties, Ernie does not take time to reply.
163516: Unless it can further his career as a henchman, Ernie is not
interested.
163568: Ernie wears his tattered rags with style; they bring a certain roguish
playfulness to his stagger. As always, Ernie's clothes (such as they are) are
clean and pressed--you seem to be the only one around here who ever gets dirty.
163732: A sinister figure, humanoid, roughly carved out of granite. Its weight
stretches to near the breaking point the reinforced operating table on which it
lies. Two dull red points serve as eyes; there are no other facial features.
163964: A pair of handcuffs dangles uselessly from your left wrist, their
half-worn state the result of Dr. Prugrave's conflicting desires to
gratuitously mistreat his assistants and to enable them to actually get work
done.
164116: Not without the key, which you haven't seen recently.
164156: This is your lucky stone, filched from under Dr. Prugrave's nose. You
rub it sometimes for good luck.
164232: A shiny stone with smooth contours.
164260: You rub the stone, and feel a bit more confident.
164296: Field geology, unlike high-energy physics (or high-energy prop comedy,
for that matter), does not afford its practitioners the luxury of fiddling
around with terribly complicated and expensive equipment. A mad geologist like
Dr. Sapient Prugrave must therefore find some other outlet for the rabid
technophilia that marks the mad scientist.

Thus, the Bean-Wrangler 600. Flashy
gauges marked in obscure units display the number of Tasmanian Mocha Beans
remaining, the barometric pressure inside the whipped cream unit, and the
current distance from Jupiter of the Galileo spacecraft. A small, nondescript
tray sits below an elaborate mechanism which dispenses everything from the
wax-paper cup to the chocolate shavings. The bulk of the front side of the
machine, however, is taken up by six hundred identical buttons, each labeled
with a number and each dispensing a different type of coffee.

(Those of you
who have obtained your copies of "Guess The Verb!" through legitimate means may
feel free at this point to have a good laugh at the expense of those
unfortunate souls who have simply downloaded a pirated copy of the game off the
Internet. Such unauthorized users of our software lack the uproariously witty
and well-laid-out "Bean-Wrangler 600 Operation Manual and User's Guide" which
you doubtless found in your gray-and-silver "Guess The Verb!" box. Unable to
determine which button to push in order to satisfy the mad doctor Prugrave,
they will meet untimely deaths whilst you skip merrily on to the next
puzzle.)

(To use the coffeemaker, PUSH BUTTON [number] or PUSH [number].)
165436: Fighting the panic that Dr. Prugrave's bellowing injects into your
blood, you meticulously scan the huge panel of buttons for some clue as to
which is the one you push several times a day to get the mad doctor's coffee.
165664: . This must be the one you press every few hours
165700: Another search of the panel only strengthens your resolve. Button
165748: Each of the 600 buttons is small, red, and labelled with a number. They
are arranged in a perfect square of 24.49487 by 24.49487 buttons (No, I don't
know what that looks like either).
165892: You need to specify which button to push, eg. "PUSH BUTTON 489229"
165952: You've already made some coffee; better to see how Dr. Prugrave reacts
to it before making another cup.
166028: You've already tried that button, with disastrous results.
166072: The Bean-Wrangler 600 suddenly comes to life, chugging, hissing, and
grinding away. Lights flash on the display panels, and
166224: a metallic voice sings "Coffee, coffee man/I've got to be a coffee man"
166296: a synthesized voice says "Up and at 'em!"
166416: drops from the bowels of the machine onto the tray. It is soon followed
by a stream of
167044: The hastily-assembled ingredients briefly swirl around the cup before
settling.
167132: ," says a robotic voice. "Your taste in coffee is clearly unmatched."
You take the hot wax-paper cup from the tray.
167220: A nondescript plastic tray built into the coffeemaker. It houses the
wax-paper cup during the coffee preparation process.
167304: Flashing lights, turning dials, spinning gauges. You'd almost think
this machine did something important.
167380: A most unappealing brew. Still, you're no judge of coffee, and Dr.
Prugrave might like it, even if it doesn't smell like his usual blend.
167480: Not a familiar smell, but as unpleasant as Dr. Prugrave's regular brew.
167532: To your peasant taste buds, all coffee tastes the same--terrible.
167580: You remember the smell of this coffee well. For a brief moment you
wonder how you could have ever forgotten which button was the correct one to
push for Dr. Prugrave's coffee. It really makes no sense whatsoever that you'd
forget how to carry out your most basic duty around here.
167776: This is it, all right. You remember this oily scent well. It probably
has real dinosaurs in it.
167844: To your peasant taste buds, all coffee tastes the same--terrible.
167892: Your breakfast is a randomly occuring event with a variable outcome.
Today brings you a cold toaster strudel--a little better than average. Dr.
Prugrave must have just recently done his shopping.
168032: The strudel sticks a bit going down, but you've certainly had worse
breakfasts.
168088: Whoa!!!!...

You know, I could have sworn that there wasn't a
bottomless pit anywhere around here. I guess the cave really is a different
place when the lights are out.
168212: The current value of your treasures and heroic deeds:
168250: points of a possible 350. The current time is
168288: "Oh, there you are," says Duran.
168316: Duran seems surprised to see you vanish.
168346: He's relatively young, as dwarves go; only about a hundred or so. At
first he starts, surprised to meet a human one-on-one, but he quickly remembers
his manners, and, doffing his miner's helmet, bows low. "Duran son of Czadhan,
at your service."
168532: You return the bow to the extent your heavy sack will allow. "
168576: "By the load you bear," says he, indicating his own bulging backpack,
"I see the factors that brought me to scenic Wyrmsworth Caverns have been at
work upon you as well."
168700: "Love of the underground realms," you reply.
168736: Duran nods, and, with a twinkle in his eye, acknowledges the one
strongest commonality, so often unstated, between human and dwarf.
168832: The grand archways are natural stone formations.
168868: The floor of this room is covered with shattered pieces of slate,
peeled off from the ceiling above. The glow of
168948: is swallowed up by the dark material of which the ceiling, floor, and
walls are made. There is a wide, rounded portal to the northwest, a narrower
entrance to the south, and a passage to the north which opens up after a little
way.
169108: Pieces of slate! Pieces of slate! They're large, dark, and not very
interesting.
169168: The slate stains your fingers, and is insufficiently valuable to carry
around anyway.
169284: The Sack of Infinite Capacity is truly a wondrous device. No matter how
many things you put into it, it never fills or becomes too heavy to carry. The
depressing thing is that this makes the sack much more valuable than just about
anything you might find to put in it.
169504: "Restricting the capacity of a Sack of Infinite Capacity, (eg., by
closing it), will cause a Minor Spatial Paradox, which in addition to its
normal area effect will destroy the sack and its contents."
169652: The Sack of Infinite Capacity is much too valuable to leave lying
around.
169704: Duran the dwarf stands beside you.
169728: Even at your unassuming height, you tower over Duran. But he is older
and more experienced, his pack battered with the experience of many adventures,
well schooled in the use of the axe that hangs at his belt. His beard is
well-trimmed in the fashion of the Northern dwarves, and a savvy evident in his
bearing makes you confident that sharing treasure with him would be more
profitable than going it alone.
170008: Upon closer inspection, Duran appears to be carrying something bulky
under his cloak.
170068: Duran fends off your attack with ease.
170096: That would be like kissing a crusty old forty-niner.
170136: "The son of Czadhan, at your service. A humble dwarven explorer."
170188: "A brave explorer. He lost his axe to a human in the caves, and died
soon afterwards. I hope to bring honor to his name with the treasure I find
this day."
170300: "No dwarf should ever be without his axe."
170332: "There's nothing like a good adventure."
170364: "Much like the one I used to learn English."
170400: "These caves hold many treasures for those, like us, who are willing to
explore its secrets."
170468: "As a threat, dragons are highly overrated. All the same, I'd rather
meet one in the zoo than in the caverns."
170548: "There is gold nearby somewhere - I can smell it."
170588: "Geodes can be quite beautiful. You should have seen the one I obtained
recently for this doctor fellow. It was perfect!"
170676: "The secret to tasty coal is the seasoning."
170708: "I'm sure we can find some treasure by working together."
170752: "A far cry from the trolls found in the tales of my grandfather. Still,
it seems his hearts are in the right places."
170836: "In tales of yore, the trolls are fierce fighters; barbaric but
honorable. Though no craftsmen, they are fine engineers, and I look forward to
the day when the long animosity between our two races is ended."
170984: "The elves have created many things of wonder, which delight even the
practical eyes of a dwarf. 'Tis said they are immortal, though when it was my
privilege to fight alongside them I saw them fall by the arrow and the sword."
171144: "The traditional enemies of dwarves. Brutish and stupid, though I have
hope for their descendants."
171216: Duran bows low. "I've no quarrel with your race, young one."
171264: "Humans often talk of hobbits, but where is the proof?"
171304: "A sorry lot. Weekend spelunkers who have traded their pickaxes for
picture-boxes. They dishonor these caves with their slack-jawed presence. Ah
well, more treasure for us, I suppose."
171440: "Never sit on a stalagmite. I learned that lesson early in life."
171488: "I once saw one as long as a dragon's tail!"
171524: "It is said that idol grants upon its bearer either good fortune or a
terrible curse. The legends are not particularly clear on that point. Exquisite
carving work, either way."
171648: "An invaluable resource for any adventurer. I have one myself."
171696: "A fascinating treasure," says Duran.
171728: "I read that book many a time as a young dwarfling."
171768: "This rope of mine has served me well. I should upgrade it soon,
however."
171824: "Although some would argue, I assure you that the dwarves of the North
are the hardiest in the land."
171896: "Crossing that bridge will be tricky, I wager."
171932: "I know not what the number signifies."
171964: "I'm not leaving without the gold."
171992: "An invaluable resource for any adventurer. I have one myself."
172040: "A fascinating treasure," says Duran.
172072: "I read that book many a time as a young dwarfling."
172112: "No thanks, I'm saving room to carry gold."
172148: "I hardly think that would work."
172174: "Perfect!", says Duran, spotting the iron hook and gauging the distance
between it and the cliff bottom. "I'll just tie rope to hook, here..." Hastily
tying a loop into one end of the rope, Duran slips it over the hook and begins
to tighten the knot.
172358: Duran peers at the rope in his hands, which has inexplicably slipped
off the hook and become untied. "That's odd..." Retying the knot, Duran mutters
the incantation "Tie rope to hook!"
172496: Again Duran finds himself holding an untied knot. "Okay, let's try
another one," he mutters. "Put rope on hook!"
172582: Duran looks dismayed, and pokes at his ill-behaved rope. "That's always
worked before," he mutters, "so there can't be anything wrong with the rope.
Don't worry, I'll figure it out."
172720: "Put rope on hook!" Duran loops the rope around the hook. It
immediately unravels and falls onto the floor.
172798: "Attach rope to hook," says Duran, doing so. The rope almost seems to
leap off the hook and back into his hands. Duran is genuinely puzzled.
172902: Duran stands on tiptoe to scrutinize the hook.
172938: "Maybe there's another hook," says Duran. But examination turns up
nothing.
172998: "Tie rope to hook," says Duran halfheartedly. It doesn't work.
173050: "Maybe the knot is wrong," says Duran, tying a slight variation. "Tie
rope to hook!"
173118: "Maybe if I used the other end... no, they're the same."
173166: "Don't worry, I'll figure it out," says Duran.
173208: "Wonder if something else in my pack might be of use," muses Duran. He
doesn't seem optimistic.
173280: "Wrap rope around hook," says Duran halfheartedly. The rope simply
drops off the loop.
173344: "Fix rope to hook!" Duran's valiant attempt fails.
173384: "Tourists!" Duran snorts derisively, lowering his voice. "They come to
the caverns and what do they do? They take pictures! I don't know why the cave
trolls put up with it. These orcs and Southern dwarves know nothing of a good
adventure."
173558: Duran takes a lump of coal out of his pocket and offers you a piece.
When you decline, he shrugs and bites into it, chewing with gusto.
173656: Duran strokes his beard a moment in thought.
173688: "Did you catch the game last night?", asks Duran. "Borak's lubbing was
fantastic!" You're not sure what game Duran is talking about, so you nod
noncommittally.
173808: Duran rests his hand momentarily on the haft of his axe.
173848: Duran leans over the ledge, shining his headlamp into the murky
darkness below. "Gold!" he exclaims, rubbing his hands together. "Thousands of
points worth!"

The dwarf pulls a coil of rope from his backpack. "I knew this
would come in handy," he says, hefting the coil in his hands.
174054: As Duran enters the room, he lets out a chuckling roar. "By the gods!",
he murmurs. "This splendid room would make a dining hall worthy of the dwarves
of old!"
174174: Duran whistles appreciatively at the crystals, even though they are
valueless quartz. Apparently dwarves can appreciate beauty even unalloyed by
riches.
174282: Duran hums impatiently, edging towards the cliff edge.
174324: Duran hints that perhaps the two of you should descend the ledge.
174370: "You know, someone else could just climb down that rope and get all our
gold." Duran seems nervous at the possibility.
174460: A yellow hard hat, reinforced with steel. A headlamp is embedded into
the plastic, and shines brightly.
174544: A trusty axe with a wooden shaft and a sharp double blade. An orange
plastic grip covers most of the shaft, and bears the runes "Cave Depot".
174652: An old, battered dwarvish backpack, full of use and treasure.
174752: You went through all that trouble fastening the rope and you want to
unfasten it before going down?
174820: Duran waves you off. "I got it," he says.
174852: Duran shrugs and hands you the rope. You quickly tie a rudimentary knot
and loop it over the hook. Your knot seems to melt away as the untied rope
slips back into your hands. You hand back the ill-behaved rope.
175000: Duran waves you off. "I got it," he says.
175032: Duran shrugs and hands you the rope. You quickly tie a rudimentary knot
and loop it over the hook. Amazingly, the knot holds!

"Astounding!" exclaims
Duran. "'Fasten'--who would have thought?"
175176: You can't climb the chasm walls.
175200: You are in a chasm, studded with stalagmites, running from the north to
the southeast. A swaying rope bridge runs from west to east, far above your
head.
175308: Made of ropes and wood, the bridge sways high above your head.
175352: The bridge is far above your head.
175376: Rocky cones, pointing upwards.
175400: One stalagmite near the center of the room has a "13" carved into it.
175452: A particularly large stalagmite. Apart from its size and the crude "13"
carved into it, it is unremarkable.
175532: The chasm ends here, its walls narrowing to nothing. You can only
proceed back to the northwest.
175600: There are rare stamps here!
175620: Misprints, first-day covers, you name it.
175652: The large quartz crystals that cover the rounded walls of this small
room give you the feeling of being inside an oversized geode. The lamplight
reflects, and reflects, and reflects again from the glittering display that
surrounds you. The crystals are clear near the ceiling at the far end of the
room, but gradually take on a purplish sheen towards the exit to the southeast.
175912: Myriad glittering crystals cover the walls and ceiling of this room. An
awesome sight.
175972: This room is so large, it makes you claustrophobic. You cannot help but
think how far underground you must be, that a cave ceiling might be so
impossibly high without opening to blue sky. The tremendous mass of empty air
above you seems to press harder than mere rock ever could. But you cannot look
away, for running down the walls are breathtaking waterfalls of stone, enormous
calcite formations that seem to have been formed from the discarded candles of
a million million visitors. Sloping arches form stone awnings over paths to the
south and northeast, and a tight crawl leads west.
176376: The stone waterfalls are mesmerizing in their ancient beauty.
176420: A towering row of variegated stone cylinders.
176452: A winding stairway reaches up into the blackness here. Another natural
chimney; about a hundred feet up, it opens up to a large room to the southwest
(accessible to you through an arch). Far above you, you can hear the sounds of
someone, as yet invisible, slowly rappeling down.
176648: Skilled trollish engineers were engaged to make this impossibly long
stairway creaky and rickety-looking, but also strong and stable enough to
support generations of lawsuit-happy tourists. It stretches up into the
darkness. Presumably there is a gift shop on the other end.
176840: You and Duran climb the stairway for several minutes, but seem no
closer to the cave exit than before. Winded, the two of you rest a while and
come back down.
176952: You climb the stairway for several minutes, but seem no closer to the
cave exit than before. Winded, you rest a while and come back down.
177048: They may not be much to look at, but they outnumber you.
177088: The tourists consult their guidebooks, see that you are not in it, and
carefully step away from you.
177160: The orcs are typical of orcs these days - strong as ever, but highly
domesticated by the introduction of television into their culture.
177256: The few elves in the tourist group seem a bit high strung. Still, they
blend in nicely with their Hawaiian shirts.
177336: A group of tourists sloughs its way through the caverns.
177376: A group of fat, belching tourists congregates around a frazzled
trollish tour guide who reluctantly explains the wonders of treasure-laden
Wyrmsworth Caverns. Most of the tourists are dwarves or orcs, and each appears
to have won his or her local Loudest Hawaiian Shirt competition before moving
on to the regionals here in the cave.
177608: A young bleary-eyed troll points out interesting formations to the
spellbound tourists, occasionally dropping hints relating to the wondrous
treasures to be found in the Wyrmsworth complex. His flip-flop sandals slap
against the cave floor as he walks slowly backwards, gesturing and pointing.
177812: Trolls are close relatives with rocks and have skin as tough as that of
a rhinoceros.
177872: That would be like kissing a rock, and then being beaten up.
177916: "There are still many treasures to be found in the caves," the guide
replies, a hopeful look crossing his face.
177996: "The cave itself has existed in lore for about nine thousand years, and
archaeological evidence shows that it has been populated by trolls and dwarves
for about three thousand. It wasn't until 1973, however, that tourism first
began on the upper levels."
178176: "Blah blah blah, an amazing natural formation, blah blah blah."
178224: "Millions of years of geologic activity to form, yadda yadda yadda."
178274: "The former slate mine provided a much of the state's slate from 1941
until the cave complex was made a national park in 1973. It's not the best
slate in the world, but its adequate for some purposes."
178424: "I don't have much use for them."
178452: "Quartz can be very attractive, but it doesn't have much value. Except
perhaps to certain new-age types. Heh heh!"
178536: "For more on that topic, please see the book section of the gift shop."
178588: "The Cockatoo's Egg Diamond is a flawless blue diamond, considered
priceless by many," says the guide. "It's indicative of the many treasures
still to be found in the caves." He gives you a theatrical wink.
178740: "The cool hive owl may take you there," the guide whispers to you.
178788: "No one knows the real meaning of the carving. Or if they do, they're
not telling."
178852: "Those form on the cave ceiling."
178880: A look of distaste crosses the guide's face for a moment. "They travel
all the way out to the caves and what do they take? Pictures! It seems no one
is looking for an adventure these days."
179016: "Orcs are useful as guard dogs and about as bright," whispers the guide
surreptitiously. "Not to mention too tough and gamey."
179108: "Flittery beings, elves," says the guide. "They have their good points
though," he adds, glancing at the elves in his group and wiping away a bit of
drool from the corner of his mouth.
179240: "Dwarves have a good head for treasure and little else. Probably why I
dislike them so little."
179308: "Pesky creatures. Seems like every year there are more of them around."
179360: "Hobbits are totally mythical. A bedtime story mothers tell their young
trolls when they want them to go out and dig up the hillside the next day."
179464: "Your companion seems like a first-class plunderer to me," says the
guide approvingly.
179528: "Gaining and receding flood waters played an important role in the
formation of this cave system."
179596: "You look like you might stray from the tour. Excellent."
179640: The troll says nothing in response.
179668: "A useful device - if you're hunting for lodestones."
179708: "Keaton! Now there was a man with a sense of adventure."
179752: "Good to see this is still required reading."
179788: "Mmmm you could fit a lot of treasures in there, yes indeed!"
179832: The guide's eyes sparkle with delight, and he gives you an approving
nod.
179884: The guide admires the shifting treasure and raises his eyebrows in mock
surprise.
179980: "That's been lost to the mists of legend for years! Eight years, to be
exact."
180040: "I see you are an adventurer of rare talent!"
180076: The guide takes a look, but says nothing.
180108: "You better hold onto that. You never know when it might prove useful."
180184: You hear echoing voices from below.
180212: Something is wrong with the tour!
180284: "Okay," says the new guide, "here we are near the winding stair, where
our tour of the lower levels will begin and end -- should take about thirty
turns."
180396: "You'll notice the calcite formations here at the bottom. These were
formed in the same way as the ones you saw on your way down, but they look a
little different because these have the floor to work on as well as the walls.
They're also a bit more eroded, meaning that the shapes are more advanced."
180604: "If I could get you to all move through this archway to the southwest,"
says the guide, "I can show you some more of this type of formation."
180708: The crowd oohs and aahs at the space in this room. "This whole cavern
is joined to the one to the north, and was formed over millions of years by
gaining and receding flood waters," says the guide.
180848: The guide indicates one of the more prominent features of the room.
"This is one we call 'The Organ', due to the variegated 'pipes' you can see
running up there."
180968: "Now if you'll all follow me to the south, we'll visit the slate room."
181020: "The slate room, here, was once a mine which provided much of the
state's slate, from 1941 until the cave complex was made a national park in
1973."
181130: A dwarvish child trips over a thick slab of slate, skinning her knees.
The guide and the child's parents help her up and dust her off.

"Um, to the
northwest, here," says the guide, "we have one of the most spectacular sights
to grace Wyrmsworth Caverns."
181316: "This is what we call the 'geode room', because it resembles the inside
of a geode. It's not really a geode, though. The quartzite crystals are part of
a quartz vein that runs through this area, and were caused by
dwaeomer-oxidization as this whole section of rock was undergoing magical
erosion about twenty thousand years ago."
181548: "I'd like to point out that the stunning beauty of the geode room is
reminiscent of the great riches that are hidden within Wyrmsworth, waiting to
be discovered by intrepid adventurers. In fact, as recently as 1996, a diamond
the size of a cockatoo's egg was found near here." The guide pauses, searching
his audience for signs of interest.
181788: "Well," says the guide. "This is just about the halfway point on our
tour... follow me, please."
181864: A disappointed look momentarily flashes across the guide's face as he
surveys the tourists. "Well," he says, "this is just about the halfway point on
our tour... follow me, please."
181996: "Will we be seeing any stalagmites on this tour?", asks an elderly orc.
182048: "Yes, of course," says the guide. "After all, what would a cave tour be
without stalagmites? Actually, we're on our way to the stalagmites right now,
if you'll just follow me up this slope." The guide glances behind him, not
anxious to trip over a chunk of slate as he walks.
182246: "Here are, uh, the stalagmites," says the guide, waving in their
direction. "These were formed by gradual accretion of--"

"Excuse me," says an
elf, pointing a delicate finger toward a stalagmite nearly as tall and thin as
she is, "I thought these were stalactites, these on the bottom."
182460: "No, that's a common misconception," says the troll. "Stalactites are
formations that accrete from the ceiling. Stalagmites are those that accrete on
the cave floor, such as this one, Stalagmite 13."
182608: "This chasm we're in extends a little to the south," says the guide,
pointing down the narrowing gulf. "Er, southeast, I suppose. But we'd never all
fit down there, so this is as far as we'll go there. We'll start making our way
back to the stairs, now."
182796: "How long has Wyrmsworth been operating?" asks an orcish tourist with a
particularly loud Hawaiian shirt.
182872: "The cave itself has existed in lore for about nine thousand years, and
archaeological evidence shows that it has been populated by trolls and dwarves
for about three thousand. It wasn't until 1973, however, that tourism first
began on the upper levels." The guide stumbles as he heads towards the north
exit, but catches himself before falling.
183116: A camera flash goes off among the group, capturing the grandeur of this
room on film. The guide looks exasperated, but says nothing, simply trudging
towards the northeast.
183236: "There's another group coming down," says the guide, halting his
group's approach toward the staircase. "We'll just wait a bit until they get
down here."
183348: Echoing footsteps on metal grow louder as a new tour group files into
the cavern to join the group that just finished its tour. The two guides
exchange pleasantries as the last of the huffing tourists descends the stairs.
183500: "Okay," says the old guide, stepping onto the stairway. "Let's get back
up to the higher levels, so you can transfer to another tour or visit the gift
shop."
183616: As the old tour group begins to disappear into the darkness above, the
new guide clears his throat, preparing to begin his tour.
183704: The sandals are extra large to fit trollish feet.
183738: You and Duran scramble through a short crawl, and find yourselves...
183792: You scramble through a short crawl, and find yourself...
183836: A stooped, gravely crawl that tightens to the west. The sloping tunnel
at the west end would be impassable for an adult, but a determined
eleven-year-old should be able to squeeze through it. (What luck! You happen to
be a determined eleven-year-old!) Even if you weren't, you'd still be able to
back out to the east, where the crawl abruptly opens up into a much larger
room.
184104: There is a bowling trophy here!
184128: A dented but shiny bowling trophy of bronze. Inscribed on the base are
the
184180: You shimmy down the rope, Duran following you...
184220: I assume what you meant by that command was "Stay as far away from the
edge of the ledge as possible." Rest assured that you are already doing that.
184324: Few people ever visit this subterranean clifftop, since few can get
here in the first place--the wandering children of tourists, perhaps, or of the
trolls who inhabit these caves. Hopefully, none are too young to know that
those who play too close to the edges of cliffs inevitably end up as object
lessons to others.
184624: Duran says it's gold, but you can't tell, it's too far down for you to
see.
184680: The cliff is sheer and dangerous-looking. I wouldn't attempt it without
a rope.
184740: Oddly enough, this hook is a completely natural iron precipitation.
Although rusty, its fusion to the rock wall stands any test of strength you can
think to apply to it
184856: . There's a sturdy rope tied to the hook
184888: A rusted iron hook protrudes from the wall above the cliff.
184930: A cliff looms above you, here; you can ascend via a rope that dangles
before you, or follow the pebbled path of an ancient and long dry waterway to
the north or the southeast.

There are many gold bars here!

Duran drops off
the rope and struts around, admiring the piles of gold. "Fabulous!", he
exclaims, shaking your hand and insinuating a gold bar into your pack. "We make
quite a team!" Excited, the young dwarf begins to sort the bars into two piles,
but when he looks up, you are gone...
185288: A white book with a blue spine, entitled "Dungeon Exploration". There's
a picture of a giant clamshell on the cover, thus the nickname. Flipping
through the book brings nothing to your eye that seems relevant to your current
situation.
185456: An old family heirloom.
185476: A combination wristwatch and compass, indispensable for any adventurer.
The current time is
185540: You can't afford to lose this watch, since you have no other way of
getting compass directions.
185612: It seems to shift under your gaze--now an ankh-shaped amulet, now the
deed to an orphanage, now a piece of futuristic machinery. In another world,
perhaps, this item would complete your quest. Now, however, it is merely one of
many treasures you wish to find.
185796: A jade idol of a great and terrible god, probably once an integral part
of some ritual ceremony. Oh well, defilement is all in a day's work!
185896: A canister of celluloid, labeled "Nov. 1921 - B. Keaton." Not the sort
of treasure one normally expects to find in a cave, but valuable nonetheless.
186008: A small box of apple juice, the sort that goes into your lunchbox when
you're not on vacation.
186076: You should probably drink it instead.
186104: The apple juice slides down your throat, and your stomach quickly is
full.
186156: You stand in a slight depression in the middle of a Y-shaped junction.
Tunnels from the southwest, northwest, and east converge onto this spot.
186260: A slight depression in the rock.
186284: That would be a fruitless endeavor.
186312: The junction is Y-shaped.
186332: C'mon, that hasn't helped in one single annoyingly gimmicky maze since
the original.
186392: You are in a directed graph of twisty little edges, all alike.
186436: It looks like every other directed graph you've ever been in.
186480: Which do you mean, the twisty edge or the twisty edge or the twisty
edge or the twisty edge? Get the picture? The edges are twisty, and they are
all alike.
186592: Little more than a hollow in the rock. The only exit is to the
southeast.
186644: There are Pokemon cards here!
186668: Almost a complete set.
186684: The gate is closed.
186700: Certain suicide.
186712: A hallway to the west flares out here into a ledge that overlooks a
chasm. A wooden bridge to the east is guarded by a gate with a metal sign
hanging from it. The gate, in turn, is guarded by a bored-looking young troll,
who stares at you with the look of someone who has been here for a long time.
186948: . There seem to be a number of people down there
186984: . There seems to be someone down there
187048: Made of ropes and wood, the bridge sways before you.
187088: A wooden gate, white striped with red. It's closed, and a rusty sign
hangs from it.
187148: A metal sign, spotted with rust.
187228: A young green troll stands here, staring absently at you. From one of
his many piercing rings hangs a nametag. His webbed hands and feet indicate
that he'd be happier swimming in an underground lake.
187368: Trolls are close relatives with rocks and have skin as tough as that of
a rhinoceros.
187428: That would be like kissing a rock, and then being beaten up.
187472: "Pass, ye may, if the gold ye have."
187500: "I am troll. Trolls build things. One day I will build things."
187548: "Gold I require, if ye are to cross, but golden eggs I cannot accept.
Company policy."
187612: "Trolls build things. I am troll."
187640: "The small delvers. My respectful enemies."
187676: "No friends of caves or water, they."
187704: "I have yet to see they who remain unseen, above yet under ground. A
great mystery."
187768: "Source of life, my slippery home."
187796: "A friend of mine. We met over the Internet."
187832: "I hold to the four principles, yes."
187860: "The gate I guard. The bridge the gate guards. The chasm the bridge
guards. The treasure the chasm guards. Heh!"
187944: "Symbols of my adherence to the four principles."
187980: "Not for your understanding, I fear. A place for humans in the Plan
nonetheless."
188040: The troll shuffles from foot to foot, saying nothing.
188080: . "Gold alone," he says, handing
188108: It says "MY NAME IS UHGRU--HOW MAY I HELP YOU?"
188236: Taking computers moves one's actions out of the realm of text adventure
exploratory activities and into the realm of outright theft. Besides, the
system administrator is right here.
188434: /100. This gives you a rank of See Me After Class.
188480: A grown-up with curly blond hair and glasses appears out of thin air,
shouts "I like beans!", and promptly vanishes.
188636: erminals runs parallel to the south and west wall, ending in a Windows
machine and an old Macintosh (for contrarians) in the northwest corner. A couch
makes the environment conducive to overnighters and software design bull
sessions. The exit is to the east.
188816: An old couch, missing quite a bit of stuffing.
188852: You could do that, but what would be the point?
188948: edu is CSUA's main machine, and hosts hundreds of user accounts. From
the way Fred keeps frantically switching between configuration files, you get
the feeling that something is wrong with that machine.
189090: Your hands seem to fly over the keys as Fred steps aside for you.
Obscure knowledge wells up from deep inside you as you change configuration
files left and right. When the dust clears, fire is back on the net!
189240: Fred offers you his congratulations, but the room has begun to spin and
fade away. You can hear Mark say, "You know, there was a Deep Space Nine
episode where--" and then you find yourself back at the...
189408: edu, is the hosting machine for the UCLA Linux Users Group, and for the
standing LUG Nethack tournament. Green shapes flicker on its screen as Dan
tests the latest additions to his game.
189556: medu is the old LUG machine. Mark is using it to surf the Web.
189604: rei is an older machine primarily used as a terminal. Leonard is
currently using it, editing Inform source files in an emacs session.
189696: It's much too heavy and awkward for anyone to take, much less an
eleven-year-old such as yourself.
189812: A rollable whiteboard, intended for scratch work, mounted on casters so
as to be pushed about. It's covered with geometric diagrams on one side and the
de facto API for a group project on the other. There is also a scoreboard of
some sort: "DAN
190112: login banner, enticing passers-by to make use of the cut-rate circuit
simulation software within. The only exit is to the west, and it looks quite
inviting.
190224: A shiny paperclip lies noticed (by you) on the floor.
190264: Well, I guess now that you've examined it, it's no longer unnoticed.
190316: A shiny paperclip lies unnoticed on the floor.
190436: T. This does not add to their interest.
190510: To the north, Bill Gates is counting his money.
190556: Adam's notebook is filled with hand-drawn schematics, Karnaugh maps,
and hastily scribbled notation.
190628: But Adam needs it to do his project!
190656: An unsightly pile of empty cups that once contained coffee and empty
bottles that once contained sparkling apple juice.
190740: You have no need for the empty cups and bottles.
190776: The Cafe is normally a busy, boisterous place, but midterms have
brought a horde of students swarming in to lay waste to the land, purchasing
practically everything on the large wire racks and in the refrigerated
containers, and otherwise reducing the number of objects which must be
implemented in this game. Only the arcade games in the corner and the geeky
drawings on the walls bear witness to the Cafe's previous glory.
191068: The cashier blocks your way and will not let you leave! Maybe you
should pay for that cola first.
191136: A bottle of cola is the only item of merchandise remaining.
191180: A twenty-ounce bottle of cola, cold to the touch. According to one of
the myriad pricing signs on the wall, it costs eighty cents.
191272: You have no money. Yet the cola is not free.
191304: You should pay for the cola before drinking it.
191340: She is sitting behind the counter near the cash register, reading a
book on soil mechanics. Her primary concern right now seems to be passing her
midterms.
191448: A surly cashier sits beside the cash register, studying for her
midterms.
191500: The cashier is protected by the counter.
191528: "It's cold. It's caffeinated. It's brown. It's also eighty cents," she
responds, not looking up from her book.
191612: "It's not as boring as some things I could think of if given enough
time. Say, thirty years."
191680: "Everything is sold out, except for that cola."
191716: "He's from Tennessee. Works on a bridge. I met him in a chat room."
191768: A chilling look from the cashier suggests this is not the time to
engage in idle timepiece banter.
191836: "What I know about paperclips, I don't have time to tell you."
191884: "They're not bad the first seven hundred times you look at them."
191932: "For some reason, everyone paid with shiny quarters today."
191976: "The cola costs eighty cents. Cash only. No checks, Bruin cards, credit
cards, or barter."
192044: Absorbed in her reading, the cashier does not reply.
192084: The cashier eyeballs the donut. "You didn't get that here," she says.
192136: "Ah, a model X-J112 medium clip. Standard college issue in southern
California."
192200: "Uh-huh," comments the cashier, not looking up from her book.
192248: "The soda costs eighty cents," says the cashier disinterestedly.
192296: The cashier looks you over with a decided lack of interest.
192340: It's a book on soil mechanics. I don't care. Neither does she. Neither
should you.
192404: A formica counter with a cash register on top of it.
192440: It's a thirty-two-bit register, holding multiples of four dollars.
192488: They say things like "TRAIL MIX 80 CENTS" and "ALL CHEWING GUM 10 CENTS
OFF". They are largely moot at this point.
192596: This is the enumeration of the arcade games: Street Fighter, Galaga (in
a Ms. Pac-Man casing, oddly enough), and the old favorite Bust A Move. All of
them are currently in demo mode.
192732: Mostly renditions in marker of popular anime characters. A few American
comic strip characters also make their appearance. Pretty good, artistically
speaking.
192844: Some of the wire racks reach close to the ceiling. They normally
contain candy bars, trail mix, muffins, potato chips, styrofoam bowls of ramen
noodles, over-the-counter medications, and other necessities for studying. They
are completely bare, and will be until restocking tomorrow.
193044: When they are not empty, the refrigerated containers keep the soda,
sandwiches, and salads cold. Since they're empty right now, they're of little
use to you.
193156: There's nothing in them, and therefore no point in opening them.
193202: If a character as unlikely as Frederick Lee did not exist, it would be
necessary to invent him. Computer science students are common enough, but Fred
possesses that most uncommon trait among computer science students, a lust for
free software. Indeed, he has gone so far as to swear eternal vengeance against
any and all forms of proprietary code--a move previously unheard of. His thick
glasses, buzz cut, and casual mode of dress give him a look unlike any nerd you
have ever seen.
193544: Fred is currently logged into fire, sweating over the nameserver
configuration.
193600: Four computer geeks are here; Fred, Mark, Dan, and Leonard, by name.
193656: Fred looks at you. "Do I know you?"
193684: "He's over there," says Fred, pointing to his right.
193788: Fred looks briefly at you, then back at his screen.
193824: Fred holds you off with one hand, typing with the other.
193864: "Hmm," says Fred, not taking his eyes off the screen.
193904: Fred catches the donut and eats it.
193932: The paperclip bounces harmlessly off of Fred.
194000: "I suppose that thing answers your questions when you need help."
194048: "Yeah, yeah, I know I should be in class," says Fred.
194092: Fred ignores you, concentrating on the screen.
194128: and wolfs it down. "Thanks," he says. "I didn't have any lunch."
194180: Fred eyes the paperclip with disdain. "If I wanted a paperclip, I'd use
vigor," he says.
194246: "Okay, it should work now," says Fred.

Mark types in a command and
shakes his head. "Nope."
194320: "What could be wrong?", wonders Fred.
194350: "Maybe the nameserver's down," says Fred. "Can somebody ping east?"

"I
can ping east," says Dan.
194432: "It must be something in the host configuration,", says Fred.
194478: "When was the last time anybody managed to get onto fire?", asks
Fred.

"Last night," says Mark. 

"Earlier this morning," says Dan.

Fred
shakes his head.
194604: "I can't figure out what's wrong with the configuration," says Fred,
pounding on fire's keyboard.
194676: "I don't understand it," says Fred. "I thought I'd set up fire's
configuration to rid of this problem, the last time this happened."
194776: "I wonder if something's wrong with the firewall," says Fred.
194824: "No, that didn't work," says Fred to himself.
195412: Dan isn't paying attention to you.
195440: "Somehow I think you're the expert on that."
195476: "The guy with glasses," says Dan, pointing to his left.
195520: "The guy with long hair," says Dan, pointing to his right.
195564: "Over there, by the end of the table," says Dan, pointing to his right.
195620: "Fred's working on it," says Dan. "The stupid network is always going
down."
195680: "I wish this machine had a decent video card," says Dan.
195724: "Those terminals are pretty junky."
195752: "I'm glad the LUG got xorn--kuato's a really old machine."
195832: "Connectionless protocols are on their way out."
195868: "I feel an obligation to come out against the categorical imperative."
195920: "Good ol' Arizona Central Lutheran," says Dan.
195960: "Store-and-forward? Too many opportunities for eavesdropping. Of course
if you don't use encryption it's your own fault."
196052: "What's with the hole? Can't you make a bagel with no hole? What are
they trying to do, rip us off?"
196128: "Man, what a poorly designed language. Torsion will be much better."
196224: Dan fends off your clumsy attack. "Violence is the last refuge of the
incompetent," he says.
196292: "That's nice, kid," says Dan detachedly.
196324: Dan catches the donut and eats it. "Man, that donut sucked," he says.
196376: Dan catches the candy bar and eats it. "Not enough tonsil flavor," he
says.
196432: Dan catches the licorice rope as it wraps around him. "These things are
nothing but corn syrup," he says, wolfing it down.
196520: The paperclip bounces harmlessly off of Dan.
196552: "I'll take that, if you're offering it," says Dan.
196592: "Those things focus more on rote memorization than on building language
comprehension," notes Dan.
196664: "That's a poorly made frog," says Dan."
196696: "Man, what a cheap toy," says Dan."
196728: "Paperclips break too easily," says Dan.
196760: Dan expounds on the inefficiencies of a base-60 time system.
196844: Dan accepts the donut and eats it. "Man," he says. "I thought donuts
were supposed to taste good."
196920: Dan accepts the candy bar and eats it. "Not enough tonsil flavor," he
says.
196976: Dan reluctantly accepts the licorice rope. "These things are nothing
but corn syrup," he says, wolfing it down.
197056: "I don't need a paperclip," says Dan disinterestedly.
197096: Dan isn't paying attention to you.
197124: "What's the volume of the intersection of a cone and a circle?", asks
Dan, in case someone has this fact memorized. No one has.
197216: Dan sketches a diagram on some scratch paper.
197248: "I have this bizarre feeling that I keep saying the same things over
and over again," muses Dan. "And I know I've written this function before.
Maybe there's something to Nietzsche's idea of eternal recurrence."
197404: Dan toys with the idea of starting his paper on Berkeley, but decides
against it. "It'd only disappear when I wasn't working on it," he says
resignedly.
197516: Dan expresses his regret that Descartes and Hume were not
contemporaries of the pay-per-view cage match.
197592: A confused light show erupts from xorn's monitor as Dan runs his game
with a gravitational constant of 0.
197668: . Dan smiles the manic grin of one who enjoys tormenting his data
structures.
197724: "Hover Carnage only has 24 classes now," says Dan.
197764: The winner of every Richard M. Stallman look-alike contest ever held
(an astounding zero), Mark Fasheh is determined to make a name for himself in
the software world. Somewhat pointless, as he already has a perfectly good
name, but that's Mark for you. Mark wears long pants and a Skinny Puppy
T-shirt, his nervous tic and permanently bloodshot eyes bearing witness to a
lifetime of caffeine abuse.
198050: Mark is currently logged into kuato, and is fluttering between surfing
the Web and hacking Newsbruiser, a program of Leonard's that Mark uses on his
home page.
198168: "I'm not much for legacy systems."
198196: "If you want to ask Fred about fire, he's over there," says Mark,
pointing to his left.
198264: "Dan's right here," says Mark, pointing to Dan's shoulder.
198312: "He shouldn't even be here, since he graduated last quarter," says
Mark.
198368: "You can't get onto fire yet," says Mark. "Fred's fu--uh, messing
around with the configuration files."
198448: "That's a pretty nice machine," says Mark.
198524: "This is my old machine. It's served me well."
198560: "You want a piece of me?" says Mark.
198588: "Aren't you a little young for that?"
198616: Mark looks bored. "I don't see why I should care," he says.
198664: The paperclip bounces harmlessly off of Mark.
198696: "I could use a donut," says Mark.
198724: "Looks like good sugar," says Mark.
198752: "You're probably too young to have seen those cartoons."
198796: "Reminds me of that one Deep Space Nine episode."
198836: "You think I don't already know how to spell?"
198872: Mark looks at the paperclip, unable to fathom your interest in it.
"What about it?"
198932: Mark looks briefly at your watch and then back at his screen.
198976: "I could get a hundred paperclips if I wanted," says Mark.
199056: session and restarting.

"Use lynx," suggests Fred.
199096: Mark takes a break from his hacking to extol the virtues of
Python.

"Python doesn't suck as bad as some other languages I could mention,"
says Dan. From him, this is high praise.
199226: Mark stifles a laugh.

"What are you laughing at?", asks
Leonard.

"This post on Slashdot."

"Ah yes," says Fred.

"I didn't think it
was that funny," says Leonard.

"It was all right," says Dan.
199388: "Did I tell you about my internship with VA Linux?", asks Mark of the
room in general. No one seems interested, and Mark soon goes back to his
terminal.
199500: Mark loads the Cruel Site of the Day into his web browser, and laughs
hysterically.
199560: Heedless of your youth, Mark lets fly an expletive. The offending verb
is echoed a moment later, in indignant tones, by Fred.
199652: Mark obsesses about the next UCLA LUG meeting.
199692: Mark curses the 405 freeway, bane of his commute.
199730: Mark asks, "Leonard, why are NBCGI and NBHtmlGenerator different
classes?"

"I don't remember," Leonard responds.
199824: In addition to being a sensitive yet manly human being, Leonard
Richardson is a musical genius and a coding god. This is primarily due to the
fact that, as the author of this game, it fell upon him to write the previous
sentence. His T-shirt advertises the Second Annual Lake Arrowhead Rubber Ducky
Race (1988).
200052: Leonard is currently logged into rei, and is working on a text
adventure which he hopes to enter in the 2000 Interactive Fiction Competition.
At the moment he is attempting to program a random dialogue engine for four
particularly fanciful characters.
200228: "Fred is always having to mess around with fire," says Leonard
ponderously.
200284: "I roomed with him last year," says Leonard.
200320: "Mark's a good guy, although completely insane," says Leonard.
200368: "Boy, what a fix he's in," says Leonard overdramatically.
200412: "Those machines don't do anything."
200440: "You're getting warmer," says Leonard.
200472: "I've still got the highest Nethack score on that machine," says
Leonard.
200576: "That's classified," says Leonard.
200604: You clobber Leonard from behind, sending him to the floor. As the
universe suddenly folds in on itself, you realize that killing the author of
the game is a bit counterproductive...
200732: "I don't think that's appropriate," says Leonard.
200772: "Irrelevant," says Leonard, without really thinking about it.
200820: The donut bounces off Leonard. "Yeah, just throw donuts at the author
of the game, that's a sure way to win," he mumbles.
200908: "Cold, cold, cold," says Leonard. "You're never going to solve this
puzzle at this rate."
200976: "The donut corresponds to the corn dog," says Leonard.
201016: "I see you've guessed at least one verb," says Leonard.
201060: "I see you've guessed at least two verbs," says Leonard.
201104: "I see you've guessed at least three verbs," says Leonard.
201236: "I see you've been to the warlock's castle," says Leonard.
201280: "You need that after you finish this scenario," says Leonard.
201328: "That corresponds to your identity bracelet," says Leonard.
201372: Leonard eats the donut. "Bleah," he says. "I should have made it a
better-tasting donut."
201440: Leonard eats the candy bar. "Tasty," he says.
201476: "Don't give that to me, you need it," says Leonard.
201516: Time suddenly seems to slow down, as you look over Leonard's shoulder
and see him writing this very sentence. Your act of looking and his description
of it chase each other around chains of causation and precedence, until Leonard
suddenly stops writing this paragraph, allowing you to look away. "I'll get
back to that later," he says, although you get the feeling that he already has.
201784: "This part of the game is a little too self-referential for my taste,"
says Leonard, indicating an especially indulgent monologue on his screen. "In
fact, I shouldn't be here at UCLA in the first place, since I graduated before
I even started this game--so did Adam, incidentally. But authorial
self-insertion is a time-honored IF trope, and it seemed a shame to miss such a
golden opportunity to make use of it."
202084: "Actually," Leonard confides to you, "this scenario setup is perfect.
It lets me write a college game in the manner of
202240: "Hey, I want to be in the game," declares a man whom you suddenly
notice is standing in the room. "Okay," says Leonard, and the man abruptly
disappears.
202412: "You know," says Leonard, "I could write a better IF language than
Inform."

"That's the spirit!", says Dan.
202572: Inform uses a colon to divide parts of a 'for' loop specification.'
Why?"
202628: "Oops!", says Leonard, and taps some keys. "There was no way to get
from the balcony to the snack bar. I put in some stairs. Sorry about that."
202736: Adam Kaplan seethingly regards the schematic on his screen.
202780: Normally, Adam is an amiable and pleasant fellow. But now, he is at
war. At war with a hypothetical piece of hardware, and an all-too-real piece of
software. The workstation he has claimed is surrounded by empty coffee cups and
apple juice bottles
202956: , having done his part to extinguish the Cafe's supplies earlier today.
Now,
203012: his head hangs heavy as he contemplates the mess of pixelated wires on
the screen. He has not slept for a while.
203092: Adam clenches his teeth and regards his monitor.
203128: "I think you'd know more about that than I would."
203168: "He's a cool dude. I've played a couple sets with him. Wish he was here
helping me with this."
203240: "John and Leonard are supposed to be helping me on this project," says
Adam.
203296: "I think he's with CSUA," says Adam.
203328: "That's Leonard's roommate," says Adam. "Ex-roommate, I guess."
203384: "Just call me 'The Dude'," says Adam. "'El Duderino', if you're not
into that whole brevity thing."
203464: "That's where I get my email," says Adam. "Usually, I mean."
203548: "I don't know anyone named Rei," says Adam."
203584: Adam looks up. "Total Recall, right?"
203656: "I don't know what you're talking about," says Adam.
203696: Adam seems on the verge of losing patience.
203728: Being much bigger and stronger than you, Adam easily fends you off.
"Dude, calm down!" he says.
203800: Adam ignores you, preferring to click with his mouse.
203840: Adam catches the donut and eats it. "Man, that's dry," he says. "I need
something to wash that down with."
203964: "I had one of those this morning," says Adam.
204000: "Leonard keeps making up weird stuff about that guy," muses Adam.
204048: "What'd you win that at a carnival or something?"
204084: "Never seen one of those before," says Adam. "It's like one of those
stupid parody T-shirts."
204156: "Yeah, it's a paperclip, all right."
204188: Adam eats the donut. "Man, that's dry," he says, swallowing hard.
"Definitely not of Krispy Kreme quality."
204272: Adam eats the candy bar. "Tastes pretty much like the real one," he
says.
204328: "The Dude does not require paperclips," says Adam.
204368: "What am I supposed to do about it?"
204396: Adam clenches his teeth and regards his monitor.
204430: Adam drags some wires around with his mouse.
204464: Adam consults a notebook filled with hand-drawn schematics.
204508: "I wish Leonard or John were here," says Adam.
204546: "You know," says Adam, "it really sucks that we finished this project,
and I graduated, and now I have to come back and do it again just to provide
one of the puzzles in this game."
204680: "This software is draining my power!", says Adam in a squeaky voice,
mimicking a cheesy kung fu movie.
204756: "Y'know," says Adam, casting his eye in your direction, "I may or may
not have items you might find valuable which I might or might not trade for
certain services once performed in the classic text adventure fashion."
Somewhat embarrassed, he looks back at his screen.
204948: Adam tries to check his email, but fails. "I guess fire is still down,"
he says.
205008: "Sure wish I could check my email," says Adam. "Anything to distract me
from this lousy design project."
205086: Adam flips absently through the specification for the computer he's
implementing in simulation-land.
205160: "I need some more caffeine," says Adam. "Too bad SEAS is all out of
coffee."
205222: "I wonder what's wrong with fire," says Adam. "I'd really like to check
my email."
205288: Adam curses under his breath as the circuit design software,
predictably, does The Wrong Thing.
205358: Adam reminisces about times spent playing guitar in coffeehouses.
"Those were the carefree days," he says wistfully. "Before midterms."
205460: Adam reduces a logical expression in his head, then checks it on paper
with K-maps.
205520: Adam recounts a strange experience he had late one night in the lab,
when a dark-robed figure offered to make the simulation software work properly,
in exchange for his soul.
205642: "Export to EDIF?!?!", shouts Adam. "I will not export to EDIF!"
205702: Adam picks up one of his empty coffee cups and peers inside, hoping
that he missed a little the first time around. No such luck.
205794: Adam scribbles into the notebook on the desk.
205830: Adam expresses his wish that he were in one of the classic Infocom
games, instead of this amateur effort.
205906: Adam does his side-splitting impression of Brian Kernighan.
205952: "Please!" says Adam in a nasal English accent. "It's a private issue!"
He seems to find this hilarious.
206032: A balcony to your east overlooks the garden at the center of Boelter
Hall. Palm trees planted there reach for the sky but are dwarfed by the brick
structure that surrounds them on all sides.
206166: pen double door to your west bears a sign saying "CSUA - We Make the
Digital Future Happen". Another doorway lies to the north.
206262: You climb the stairs a bit, and end up...
206296: I suppose you think there are stairs or something.
206332: The downwards stairs lead only to classrooms and maintenance rooms.
206380: I suppose you think there are stairs or something.
206416: Jump off the balcony? Truly the mark of madness!
206452: The 3rd floor balcony overlooks the garden at the center of Boelter
Hall.
206504: The modest garden features shrubs, flowers, and palm trees. Meandering
paths, laid out with wood chips, lead to occasional benches.
206600: There is nothing interesting about the double door.
206636: Someone inside the lounge yells "Don't close the door!"
206680: The palm trees rear up into the sky like excited French poodles.
206728: The trees are out of reach, and too thin to climb anyway.
206768: The sign is a printout reading 'CSUA - We Make the Digital Future
Happen'.
206828: The strains of punk rock emanate from the door to your west, the
entrance to the SEAS Cafe. A bulletin board nearby is covered in flyers, posted
by people who share the quixotic goal of making engineering students think
about something other than classes and projects. A hallway to your east leads
into the South Campus quad, and stairs lead down.
207070: You take the stairs down a bit, and end up on the...
207112: The stairs up only lead to aerospace engineering and math.
207282: , well, actually, I guess killing you for that is a bit extreme. Off
you go now.
207340: You walk down the hallway to the south, but soon return, not because of
any world-limiting desire on the part of the author of this game, but just
because the fifth floor of Boelter Hall is not a very exciting place to be.
207496: You walk briefly down the hallway for a bit, but turn back, feeling
that you still have some important task to perform in the engineering building.
207600: The flyers on the bulletin board attempt to entice students to play
broomball, attend a job fair, or join the Marines.
207752: the dreaded digital design class. Somehow you have found your way to
this foreboding place, a place so desolate that there is a door leading east
and a hallway leading west to the balcony. (I know that made no sense, but I
had to tell you that
208012: Some are dry and technical, some flush with the thrill of discovery;
some use flashy graphics to try to cover up the fact that the research in
question is something a sophomore might cook up over winter break.
208156: Yes, brilliant idea. Steal the posterboards, both completely useless
and impossible to conceal.
208256: A basic, no-frills digital watch.
208284: If you take off your watch, how is that cool clock in the status bar
supposed to work?
208344: A chocolate donut with chocolate sprinkles. As chocolate donuts go, it
doesn't look too appetizing.
208528: You have so much buzzing around in your head, though, that it's likely
something may have been forgotten in the shuffle.
208676: for a while. Since spellbooks cannot be destroyed or damaged except by
carrying them into bodies of water, this has no adverse affects, and is great
fun.
208960: I suppose you think you can memorize a spell without looking at a
spellbook.
209012: You have no text of that spell to copy.
209040: You haven't learned that spell, if indeed it is a spell.
209080: You haven't access to that spell, if indeed it is a spell.
209304: The spell seems to have no effect. If I were you, I'd look into the
complete and shocking lack of any animal simulacra on or around
209428: Absolutely, positively nothing happens. More nothing has never happened
in the history of spellcasting.
209596: The spell dissipates into the air and is quickly eaten by ambient
microbes.
209704: suddenly looks edible. In fact, it looks downright tasty.
209792: As you utter the strange words of the spell, an unearthly howl fill
your ears, and a whirling green vortex of smoke shoots from your index fingers.
Abruptly dissipating, the smoke reforms into glowing words:
209996: The spell has no effect. Maybe you should direct it at someone.
210136: What do you hope to accomplish by that? Nothing happened, by the way.
210264: The awkgrep spell is not a spell like funyun or geordi that you cast on
a person or object. You just cast it with CAST AWKGREP.
210360: There is a puff of smoke, and Tim the demon appears next to your
shoulder. Noticing the parrot on your head, Tim buzzes frantically and vanishes
back into his native plane.
210480: Tim is suddenly transported from your left to your right shoulder. He
chitters confusedly.
210544: In a puff of smoke, Tim the demon appears next to your shoulder.
"Tim!", he says, indicating himself. He shows no sign of recognizing you from
previous summons, but begins buzzing around your head, awaiting your
instructions.
210724: The spell is much too complicated to even attempt.
210760: The perlsed spell is not a spell like funyun or geordi that you cast on
a person or object. You just cast it with CAST PERLSED.
210856: The ground rumbles, but nothing happens. Perhaps you have neglected the
material component of the spell.
210930: The ground rumbles and a chill fills the air as you behold a dark shape
that rises up in thick spirals of creamy evil to tower over your head. It would
appear that you have summoned Yog-Shogurt, Beast of a Thousand Sprinkles. The
summoner's death generally follows this rash act.
211130: Before noticing you, however, Yog-Shogurt sees the other large demon
approaching you. A hideous frozen smile of recognition appears on Yog-Shogurt's
face, as the two demons clasp pseudopods.
211280: '!", exclaims Yog-Shogurt. "SO MANY AEONS AGO DID WE WALK THE HELLISH
HALLS OF THE OLD ALMA MATER!
211448: ' as the two fiends exchange the secret college handshake. "HOW FAR WE
HAVE PROGRESSED SINCE THAT DREAM-FILLED DORMITORY, EH?"
211576: Discussing old times, the two demons casually walk through the eastern
wall of the study, pausing only to smear the warlock into a thick paste on the
ground. You turn away, averting your eyes, but you are already fading...
211736: In this instance, however, Yog-Shogurt seems content to allow the rats
first chance at killing you, which they accomplish with style and efficiency.
The demon chuckles as he watches, little realizing that they're saving him for
dessert.
211992: you regret having messed around with demonology spells without first
taking the proper precautions. It's not the death, per se, that's so bad; it's
the embarrassing fact that this is exactly the sort of cheesy scenario so
popular in those magic safety films you had to watch in PE.
212192: Tim the demon is a tiny red humanoid hovering around your right
shoulder. His prehensile tail grips a pitchfork the size of an ice cream sample
spoon. Although he does not speak your language, he seems to understand your
intentions, and takes a curious interest in your activities.
212388: Tim phases out as your attack cleaves through the space he used to
occupy. A moment later, he reappears.
212464: Kissing a demon is a federal offense.
212492: Tim cocks his head, not understanding you.
212522: There is a pop, and Tim is gone from this plane.
212560: Tim sharpens his pitchfork, jabbing it into his arm to test its
sharpness.
212614: Tim perches on your manual of demonology and begins to read, taking a
keen interest in the spell that summoned him.
212696: Tim swoops downwards, pulling up just short of the floor.
212738: Tim scratches his back with his pitchfork.
212772: Tim makes a quick call to his broker.
212800: Tim yelps and turns cartwheels in the air, his tail spinning like a
ship's propeller.
212860: Tim buzzes and waves his pitchfork, but does not seem affected.
212904: With a screech, Tim flies out of the range of your spell. Once its
effects have harmlessly dissipated, he hovers near your ear and chitters
angrily.
213008: A squawking parrot paces around your head.
213040: While a humble simulacrum, the parrot was a genteel if unwieldy
companion. Your gift of life seems wasted on it, as the animate parrot is
smelly, raucous, prone to shed feathers, and fond of perching on your head.
213188: The parrot squawks and pecks at your hand.
213218: Few people kiss parrots. Fewer still would kiss this particular parrot.
Nonetheless, as your humble servant I will attempt this action.

The parrot bit
your lip. I hope you're satisfied.
213356: The obnoxious parrot seems disinclined to obey any orders from you.
213404: The parrot flutters upward, then settles back onto your head.
213448: With a final screech, the obnoxious parrot reverts to its inanimate
form and plummets lifeless to the ground.
213524: As you reach for it, the parrot bites you on the finger and flies out
of your reach, cursing.
213592: The parrot swears a terrible parrot oath, flapping its wings violently
and fluttering around before settling back on your head.
213680: You're the closest thing the parrot has to a mother, and you're already
here.
213736: The parrot leans down and stares you in the eye.
213772: The parrot begins gnawing on its own leg.
213804: A frog dances manically on the cobblestones.
213836: A born showfrog, it seeks only to entertain you through
vaudeville-style song and dance routines.
213904: You're the closest thing this frog has to a mother, and you're already
here.
213960: But the frog is only trying to entertain you!
213992: The frog isn't interested in renumeration. It's just gotta dance!
214040: The frog ignores you, caught up in the dance.
214072: The frog does not have time for hanky-panky. It's gotta dance!
214120: "Hello my darlin', hello my sweetheart, hello my ragtime gal!"
214168: "If you refuse me, honey, you lose me, then you'll be left alone!"
214220: "Oh, baby, telephone, and tell me I'm your own!"
214260: The frog completes its song with a flourish, seems to stiffen, then
drops lifeless and plush to the ground.
214336: The frog dances out of your reach.
214360: The frog starts violently but continues its routine.
214396: Frogs legs, huh? If only you could catch the little guy.
214440: A shiny top hat of the sort favored by W.C. Fields.
214480: A horde of rats swarms toward you!
214504: A few more rats appear out of nowhere and join the multitude.
214548: Terrible squealing sounds fill the air as the rats, smelling a scent
more savory and closer than yours, begin to turn on each other. Only a few,
extremely bloated rats survive the ensuing carnage, and these crawl painfully
off into the nooks and crannies of the castle.
214736: A cringing goblin slowly approaches you, knife shaking in his hand.
214784: In a puff of smoke, a wizened old female goblin appears. Surveying the
scene, she chastises her son furiously in the guttural goblin tongue. The
youngster's objections fall on deaf ears. Finally, summoning his every ounce of
courage, the younger goblin rushes to you and plunges his blade into your
heart.
215000: The goblin squeals and leaps into the air, clutching his posterior.
Waving his knife, he flees through a side passageway into the depths of the
keep.
215104: A terrifying demon approaches you, tentacles and clawed arms questing
for your blood.
215164: Hideous, mutated, slithering, towering. Ugly, even. Describing all its
disturbing features would take hours, and by then you would be playing a
different game and it would just distract you.
215298: The demon wraps its tentacles around you and begins to bend, fold,
spindle, and mutilate.
215404: A tall warrior strides toward you, hefting his ba... er, broadsword.
215456: A tall, muscular warrior from the land across the sea (just a guess).
His chiseled features, bare chest, and curly dark hair give him the look of
someone who really ought to be posing for the cover of a pulp romance novel
rather than here, about to cut you in half.
215640: The warrior bears down on you, raising his sword...
215680: "Bernie Michael Angor!" A voice from behind the warrior causes him to
stop in his tracks. His hands drop to his sides, the weapon swinging uselessly
as he turns around, cringing.
215810: "Look at you, young man!" The old woman, dressed in drab reds and
flamboyant necklaces, is not pleased. "Going out without a shirt! What are you
trying to do, die of cold? Maybe give your mother a heart attack? What do you
think you're doing with that sword? You're going to kill someone with that
thing, and what would your father think?
216056: "And you, Mr. Warlock! Terrorizing the countryside! Killing off the
peasantry! Turning the land black with oppression and woe! What do you hope to
accomplish, huh? Didn't you ever have a mother to tell you what's right and
wrong?
216226: The aged woman grabs Do'papoc and her son in an ear lock (she may be
short, but she's got long arms, and a strong grip), and begins to drag them
both, painfully, into the anteroom. Passing you, she turns and addresses you.
216392: . This is no place for someone like you." She nods at you, and you fade
away...
216456: A sword of a certain description, glinting in the dim light.
216500: I'm afraid you can't learn magic in this game.
216536: To learn, eg., the wajkcol spell, LEARN WAJKCOL. To cast it: CAST
WAJKCOL, CAST WAJKCOL ON PUPPY, or just WAJKCOL PUPPY. SPELLS will show you
which spells you have memorized.
216700: You are not at all hungry, thirsty, or tired. You can keep up to three
spells memorized at any one time.
216776: You haven't access to that spell, if it is indeed a spell.
216818: Uh-oh, you can see your hands. The invisibility potion must have worn
off! Your tactic for getting past the giant crab quickly changes from quietly
sneaking to running like mad for the oaken door on the opposite side. Hearing
the crunch of your sneakers against the shell-ridden floor, the crab
frantically scuttles around toward you, but you have reached the door. It's
unlocked! You open the door a crack, dart through, and slam it shut again.
217134: A dull thud echoes from the other side of the door, followed by a soft
scratching. Breathing a sigh of relief, you turning around, noticing for the
first time just how close you are to the end of your quest. For this is the...
217296: There's a door in the way. And unless something has changed (from the
muffled scrabbling sounds emanating from the other side, something hasn't),
there's a vicious crab on the other side of that door which you no longer have
any way of dealing with. Thus, I recommend not opening that door.
217500: The stone walls on either side of you reach high into the darkening
sky--the smell of fresh air is exhilarating after your travails within the
depths of the castle. This short hallway was once covered in lush red carpet,
but its exposure to the elements and its proximity to a trigger-happy warlock
have scorched and rotted it, exposing the cobblestones beneath. Black mold
grows on the few patches of carpeting that remain. West is the large oaken door
you so recently fled through; east you can see into the the lighted study of
the dread warlock Do'papoc.
217884: You hear the whistling of the wind, and a faint scrabbling from behind
the door to the west.
217948: Fresh air with a hint of ozone. Damp mold and rotting wood, the kind of
smell found under logs.
218016: A large, barred oaken door. You can hear scrabbling sounds from the
other side, probably made by a certain giant crab of your acquaintance.
218116: Making edible the only thing that stands between you and a ravenous
giant crab strikes you as a spectacularly bad idea.
218200: Scritch, scratch, scritch. You know, if I didn't know better, I'd say
there was some sort of huge crustacean on the other side of that door.
218304: Smells like real oak, with just a hint of seafood.
218340: Perhaps you were too quick to judge the giant crab in the shell room.
After all, first impressions can be deceiving. Gestures of friendship on the
crab's part may have been misinterpreted by you as attempts to cut your body in
two and feast on your internals.
218524: Bearing this in mind, you fling the western door open, allowing the
crab to bear down upon you with incredible speed. As the crab's enormous
pincers grab hold of your torso, you feel that maybe opening the door was a bad
move. I guess first impressions are often not at all deceiving.
218720: The black mold is in an advanced state of growth.
218756: The surviving bits of the red carpet are covered in mold.
218796: The exposed cobblestones are smooth and worn by the passage of time.
218924: Your feeling of apprehension only increases.
218956: Somehow, you feel apprehensive at the thought of learning new spells.
219004: Ouch! I suppose you think that's funny.
219036: I don't think you are an animal simulacrum.
219068: Since you are already edible (as your close encounter with the crab
demonstrated), the spell has no effect.
219144: Although it might be better if you were sharper, you are not a pencil,
so the spell has no effect.
219212: Since you first gained the formic spell, your mother has taken to
wearing a Ring of Anti-Teleportation so that you won't be summoning her every
time you're faced with a minor problem like a deadly warlock. Nothing happens.
219368: Drawing its power from the Kinda-Sorta-Semi-Quasi-Para-Elemental Plane
of Citrus, this magical bracelet grants you immunity to all citrus-based
attacks. Its gemstones sparkle the color of lemons, grapefruits, and oranges.
219532: The bracelet glows momentarily, and you smell the tart scent of
grapefruit.
219584: After that harrowing experience with the rampaging lime, you feel more
comfortable leaving the bracelet on.
219660: You manage to touch your teeth to the bracelet, but the taste of
grapefruit is much too tart for you to actually take a bite.
219748: This slight, spiral-bound tome has "
219778: Spellbook" written on the blue cover. It contains seven spells,
laboriously copied from your school textbook. Unfortunately, your school
textbook, "Harry Potter and the 2000 Middle School Magical Education
Standards", tends to focus less on the "cause mighty warlock to tremble in
fear" type spells and more on the "subject target to sharp kick in pants" type
spells. In fact, "subject target to sharp kick in pants" is probably your best
spell, apart from "open even locked or enchanted objects", which you can't even
memorize anymore, since you got strawberry jam all over the runes.

Your
spellbook contains the following spells:
220314: Cthulu, summonable in eight deadly colors. The spells of summoning have
bizarre names like "lexyacc" and "perlsed", and are very complicated, some
requiring material components. Only one spell near the beginning seems even
remotely comprehensible to you:
220496: This parrot looks real enough to have been alive at one point, but it
may simply be a well-crafted construction. In any event, it's not alive right
now. Lovely plumage, though; brilliant blues, greens, and yellows. Now that
you've separated it from its perch, it has no particular orientation, and
dangles upside-down from your hand. Its glass eye stares at you balefully,
blaming you for subjecting it to the rigors of gravity.
220800: The parrot is not sensible enough to reply.
220880: Tim buzzes in alarm as the parrot eyes him. His concerns are suddenly
justified as the bird lunges for him, its claws digging painfully into your
scalp. Tim vanishes in a puff of orange smoke just as the parrot's beak is
about to cleave him in two. The parrot coughs briefly, then, embarrassed, goes
back to preening itself as though nothing had happened.
221128: A quarter from the sprite nation of Carelka. It glows with a magical
light.
221184: A blob of wax about six inches in diameter, the melted remains of the
snail candle. The wick is probably still in there somewhere.
221276: The wick is embedded deep inside the shapeless remains of the candle.
221324: The candle slowly becomes cold and slimy, but the blob of matter you
now hold is not a proper snail. It twitches lifelessly in your hands and then
is wax again.
221434: It looks like a normal book, "Lup's Compendium of Tales Most Ancient".
Opening it up, however, reveals that the book is completely blank, except for a
few lines of verse in the middle of a page near the beginning:
221896: It's a bag of Eldritch Farm cookies -- "Remember when the sun guttered
out and inky slithering blackness engulfed the earth? Eldritch Farm remembers."
The instructions on the bag indicate that the chocolatey cookies may be eaten,
or used as spell components when summoning demons of unimaginable power. There
are
222116: You eat a cookie. Chocolatey, yet evil.
222148: That was the last cookie, so you throw away the bag.
222188: This humble crouton is all that remains of your once-mighty loaf of
bread.
222240: That tasted great, and there's still some left.
222276: This tiny crumb is all that remains of your once-mighty crouton.
222322: That tasted great, and there's still a little left.
222364: This carbohydrate molecule is all that remains of your crumb. It smells
bakery fresh.
222424: That tasted great, and there's still a bit left.
222460: It's got six protons, six neutrons, and six electrons. In tiny letters
on the atom you can make out the slogan "100% ORGANIC".
222560: That tasted great, but there's not much left.
222660: ) makes its velocity proportionally indeterminate. However, I'd guess
it's probably pretty much like any other quark.
222744: You run for the door, but the rats overtake you...
222784: You run for the door, but the tall, fit warrior is faster...
222828: You run for the door, but the goblin, summoning his every ounce of
courage, leaps onto your back and drives his dagger home...
222918: You run for the door, but are halted as Do'papoc points at you and
utters a word of power: "brussel-junior!"
223004: A tingling sensation comes over your body, which quickly fades as you
disintegrate into 7,908 individually wrapped jawbreakers. If it's any
consolation, all those jawbreakers are going to be very difficult to hunt out
from under the desk, bookshelves, and so forth.
223190: The sumptuously decorated study of Do'papoc is decorated in
bookshelves, full of tomes radiating power. A large, bone-white candle drips
wax onto an oaken table, shedding light on a large, ancient spellbook and a
terribly inaccurate globe.
223360: The extreme inaccuracy of the globe suggests that the cartographer
became weary of research and started making things up as he went along.
223456: The bookshelves line the walls and are weighed down with books of all
shapes and sizes.
223516: The tomes radiate with the ancient light of power. Titles include
223716: You can't help but notice that the warlock's spellbook is a lot thicker
than yours. If a book could have an expression, this one would be smirking at
you.
223930: An aged man dressed in black robes sits at the table. Looking up from
his book, he chuckles, shaking his head.
224012: "You poor, miserable fool!", he says. "If only you had found
224204: Before you can react, the warlock casts a spell at you! It tingles a
bit, but its most noticeable effect is its complete and utter failure at
turning you into so many as ten individually wrapped jawbreakers.
224350: Do'papoc looks extremely embarrassed and hastily consults the online
documentation for the brussel spell. "Blast!", he spouts, tearing at his beard.
"The brussel spell is for ages 12 and up! Local Sorcerers 503 was clever to
send a mere child to do battle with me!" Reaching for his spellbook, the
warlock becomes calmer and more pensive. "No matter," he muses with a snarl.
"I'll simply make use of 'brussel junior', the brussel spell for the younger
set!"
224686: Do'papoc turns to his book and begins furiously memorizing a spell!
You've only got one shot at this--whatever you do, it'd better be good!
224792: The warlock Do'papoc stands at the table, lips moving silently as he
quickly memorizes a spell.
224860: The warlock Do'papoc stands at his table, watching you with amusement.
224910: Do'papoc points at you and utters a word of power:
224952: A tingling sensation comes over your body, which quickly fades as you
disintegrate into 7,908 individually wrapped jawbreakers. If it's any
consolation, all those jawbreakers are going to be very difficult to hunt out
from under the desk, bookshelves, and so forth.
225140: Unsurprisingly, nothing happens. The bokbar spell is "turn human into
parrot", and since there is already a parrot in the vicinity, the enchantment
has no effect. (Wow, I guess those arbitrary, inconvenient limitations on
spells cut both ways!)
225316: There is a squeal and a pop, and Tim disappears. The collam spell must
be some sort of banishment magic, affecting natives of another plane in
preference to you!
225428: A tingling sensation comes over your body, which quickly fades as you
disintegrate into 3,008 individually wrapped gumballs. The last image to cross
your mind is that of the warlock stamping his feet and tearing out huge chunks
of beard; the last word you hear a bellowed "GUMBALLS?!?!"
225636: Do'papoc is not pleased, and, shamelessly disregarding the rules of
turn-based magical combat, casts another spell at you. Suddenly,
225840: a sheepish-looking goblin carrying a dagger appears and cowers in the
corner. "Kill!", demands the warlock, pointing at you, and the whimpering
goblin begins a valiant attempt to approach you menacingly without ever
reducing the distance between you and him.
226020: The warlock Do'papoc stands at his table, looking a little steamed.
226068: The rats swarm over you, nipping and pulling at your flesh...
226116: "Kill!", bellows Do'papoc, slapping the goblin on the back of the head.
The startled goblin flees his master, only incidentally running towards you,
and only incidentally goring you with his knife.
226260: "Bah!", expectorates the warlock. "Enough of this! I will destroy you
and your pathetic but exceedingly well-chosen spells with one mighty blow!"
226432: a dread and doleful incantation -- "vigzip!"
226468: The dust bursts into flames, and from the roaring fire rises a demon so
hideous that describing it in all its ugliness would take more time than you
have left to play this game. Better not to chance it. Let's just say that it's
pretty darn hideous.
226888: a summons of great power -- "borax!"
226920: The dust explodes, filling the air with smoke, and from the billowing
black clouds emerges a bronzed warrior, clad in equally bronze mail and
carrying a decidedly steely bast--er, broadsword. He looks at you with a smirk,
and, nodding his head in acknowledgement of an unheard order, begins to stride
purposefully towards you.
227148: Your current score is 8 of 100 points, giving you a rank of Stowaway
Second Class.
227210: You are not at all tired.
Your stomach is content.
No hostile symbionts
inhabit your body.
227280: , I'm negotiating a docking. It may take a few minutes."
227326: The ship may or may not still be moving. You haven't a clue how to read
the sounds of the engines.
227400: You can't go that way.
227420: You can't go that way.
227440: You can't go that way.
227460: You can't go that way.
227480: Compass directions have no meaning on a ship; there is only up, down,
in, and out. Should artificial gravity fail, even up and down would be
inconsistent.
227592: The hum of inaccessible engines and machinery.
227624: With its traditional designs, this walk-in navigation room exudes a
feeling of confidence and control, of man and machine working in perfect
harmony. The manual controls are hidden behind wall panels, leaving only a
computer pop and communication screen. You can go out to the common room.
227824: The panels are set into the wall at about the level of your neck.
Presumably they will fold down in cases of computer failure, revealing manual
controls.
227932: A video screen, used in non-emergencies for informatory purposes,
rather than for guiding the ship. In addition to the usual diagrams of your
current location in space, there are details on the
228156: A round, symmetrical common area, a computer pop on the wall opposite
the entrance to the navigation room, a round white table in the center.
228256: Open hatches lead up to the sleeping quarters and down to the airlock.
228304: An open hatch leads up to the sleeping quarters, a closed one down to
the airlock.
228362: You climb down the hatch into the...
228392: A round table, intended for discussion and recreation as well as
dining.
228444: The metal tray is a relic of yesterday's catered lunch.
228484: A triangular quarter of a catered synthemeat sandwich, left over from
yesterday. It might still be edible.
228560: A triangular quarter of a slightly ripe but probably edible meat
sandwich.
228612: Mmmm...that tasted just like scrumptious synthebeast.
228652: You eat the sandwich. Let's just say that you've had better.
228696: Only the computer can close the hatches.
228724: Only the computer can open the hatches.
228752: An open hatch, leading upwards.
228776: Only the computer can close the hatches.
228804: A spartan quarters with sanitary facilities and three microgravity
bunks, two unused since yesterday. A hatch leads downwards.
228892: An open hatch, leading down.
228916: Only the computer can close the hatches.
228944: The three identical bunks nullify the ship's artificial gravity to
ensure a good night's sleep. There's something about machinery to cancel out
artificial gravity that's never quite resonated with you, but now is not the
time to ponder such things.
229116: Generic sanitary facilities of the sort that are mostly there for
completeness.
229172: The airlock would be cramped, were it not for the need to accommodate
entrance into the ship of any of the six species and nine classes of droids.
The outer airlock door opens out into the interior of the space station, and
the inner door leads up into the
229356: . A pop is in one section of the cylindrical room, although it probably
doesn't see much use.
229422: You climb up the ladder, ending up in...
229456: You step cautiously out of the airlock onto the carpeted floor of the
station. As soon as you are fully out of the airlock, you feel the sure tug of
a particle beam. It's a trap! You try to cry to the ship's computer for help,
but your vocal cords exist now only as information being sent somewhere else.
The rest of your body soon follows...
229708: is small and spartan in design. The predominant color is white, with
eggshell highlights. It seems the spacefaring equivalent of a motel room;
comfortable, bland, and strictly a temporary affair. No one spends any major
part of their life aboard this ship--except for the pilot computer.
229912: A computer's point-of-presence consists of a camera lens and speaker.
Except when controlling a droid, the pops are a computer's only way of
interfering with the real world.
230036: The computer is physically located somewhere deep inside the ship. You
can speak to it through a pop, but that's about it.
230124: The computer is physically located deep within the ship.
230164: "I'm sending our clearance code to the harbormaster."
230204: "The harbormaster doesn't seem to realize that this in an emergency.
I'm trying to impress upon him the gravity of the situation."
230296: "Okay, I think I've gotten through to him."
230332: "We'll be docking immediately."
230356: A faint shudder runs through the ship.
230384: "We are now docked. Cycling air in airlock."
230418: You hear a hissing sound underneath your feet.
230454: With a snap, the outer hatch of the airlock opens, revealing a ladder
down.
230512: "Airlock is now opened."
230572: "I've piloted diplomats from four of the six species."
230612: "I once transferred a shipment of frogs."
230644: "A standard model popular among humans, I understand."
230684: "Certain symbionts can be quite nasty. I recommend you perform a
background check before entering into a symbiotic relationship."
230850: 142855. How's my driving? Call 1-301-286-2000."
230908: is a thirty-meter transport craft. The ship has been in service for
nine standard years, and I've piloted it for the past four years."
231004: "My eyes and ears on the internal area of the ship."
231044: "As I'm sure you're aware, it is quite serious."
231084: "I can't imagine what you're talking about."
231120: "Getting clearance to dock is usually a painless procedure. Usually, I
said."
231180: "It's my opinion that this harbormaster is in need of a full
maintenance overhaul."
231296: "Synthebeast is completely vegetarian, the flesh of a bioengineered
animal made of soy proteins."
231364: "The microgravity bunks ensure a good night's sleep, or so I
understand."
231420: "SaniSuck Generic Facilities. Don't use them, myself."
231464: "Regulations forbid opening of the airlock except when safely docked or
in emergencies requiring spacewalk."
231540: "Should I be destroyed or incapacitated, manual controls will become
available in the navigation room."
231616: "I'm afraid my social programming doesn't enable me to converse on that
topic."
231676: You'd have to go to the actual location of the computer to do that.
231724: "Fascinating... it represents an unknown species."
231764: "A previously unknown species of tapeworm."
231796: "An astounding archaeological find!"
231824: "I'm afraid that's beyond my capabilities."
231896: A host of black, near-microscopic organisms that live below the
epidermis of your wrist. They can form the patterns necessary to establish your
identity, and in idle moments they can act as ad-hoc tools. The black spots
currently form the numbers of a digital clock on the back of your wrist, the
numbers flowing into each other as the organisms respond to preprogrammed
stimuli.
232156: There's no way to get rid of the tattoo without irradiating the
symbionts and then undergoing a painful skin abrasion. You have neither the
inclination nor the tools for this.
232324: . A blob of white goo rests on the slide.
232356: You smear the goo back onto the slide.
232384: A featureless blob of white goo.
232408: Mmmm...that tasted just like scrumptious fluoride toothpaste.
