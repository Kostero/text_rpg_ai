3565: Don't see that.
3581: Huh?
3800: Be more specific.
5530: Can't do that.
5776: Carrying:
5829: Taken.
5864: Not portable.
5906: Carrying too much.
5933: It is.
5957: Dropped.
6003: Can't go there.
6075: Can't go there.
6287: You see:
6528: It lies to the south.
6544: A rusty iron lamp post.
6620: They go up and down.
6666: The pencil is now sharp.
6687: That doesn't sharpen it.
6730: You rest for a while on the cot.
6807: The alien takes the sunglasses.
6878: Nobody to give the gloves to.
6902: The paper is blank.
6928: It's already repaired.
6956: You lack the skill.
7071: The alien doesn't follow you.
7118: He cowers from the open door.
7241: The pencil won't write.
7310: You wave.
7362: Can't.
8088: Can't go there.
8096: It's me!
8104: You are standing at the edge of a large wheat field.
The field stretches
off to the north.
To the south you see a barn house.
8166: You are standing outside a small barn house.
You can just see the edge of
a wide field to the north.
8212: There is a single shard of sharp broken glass inside.
8240: The sharp glass bites into your hands.
8260: With the gloves you carefully lift out the shard of glass.
8292: You are standing inside a rustic barn house.
Stairs lead up and down. The
exit is to the north.
8342: You are in a damp, musty cellar.
The smell of mildew is
everywhere.
Stairs lead up.
8396: Half rotted but still unused as it has never been sharpened.
8434: Half rotted. The pencil is sharp.
8452: Be more specific about how you want to sharpen it.
8482: You are in an abandoned underground bunker deep beneath the house.
8522: Nobody to give the sunglasses to.
8540: The alien seems interested, but...
8562: The alien takes the gloves and with them is able to repair the orb
damage.
8596: You are in a small, quaint bedroom.
The morning light is streaming in.
8638: A map of the crop circle maze is drawn on the map.
8662: You can see a huge field. In the middle of the field
is a softly glowing
orb. You see an expansive series of
crop circles that carve out a twisty maze
in the wheat field.
Looking closely, it seems as if you could navigate
the
twists and turns if only you could memorize the complex maze.
8822: You are at a clearing in a large field.
The wheat seems to be burned away
in a perfect circle here.
There is a glowing orb situated in the center of this
area.
The barn house lies somewhere to the south.
8930: You point out the damage to the alien.
He attempts a fix but is shocked
by the wires!
8980: A rather large sphere. It would be perfectly round
except for the small
tear near the underside with
a few wires exposed. The orb is glowing and
seems
to glow brighter as you approach.
9088: As you approach, a thin outline of a door appears.
You step into the orb
and WOOOSH!
9142: The damage looks extensive. Wires are sparking.
9168: You are inside an orb.
There is light streaming in from the door you came
through.
9212: There is an alien cowering nearby.
9230: The alien is no longer cowering and is now facing the door.
9262: The alien follows you out into the sunlight.
9288: A thin gangly creature with a large oval head.
9318: He looks stylish in his new sunglasses.
9342: The Alien stands at the orb door threshold and waves to you.
9376: It's you. The overalls look stunning.
9400: You awake to a thunderous boom. Looking out your window
you see what
appears to be the moon - full and bright.
Only the calendar shows a new moon
cycle. This is something
else... And soon you realize that the "moon" is
drifting.
Falling, in fact, rather quickly and this ball of light
crash lands
in your field. You head out just as dawn breaks.
9606: Using the map allows you to navigate the mathematically complex crop
circle maze.
9648: You enter the field and find several areas
where the wheat is burned,
forming passages.
However, the passages are twisty and circle
back often and
you end up back where you started.
9750: You just can't see enough of the maze to draw a map here.
9780: Using the paper and pencil, you make a detailed map of the field.
9814: You lack the tools to create a map.
9832: and then steps into the orb.
The door disappears and the orb lifts from
your field.

You have won this Miniventure!
