27370: That was a rhetorical question.

91028: Closing comments.
91048: In an interview C.E.Forman had with Matt Barringer a few years back, Mr.
Barringer commented on how awful the game was. It's made him something of an
(in)famous legend in the IF community. I suspect that, if he were to do
"Detective" now, he'd definitely do it differently.
91252: Matt probably can't help but cringe every time he has "Detective"
mentioned to him. It makes "Inhumane", by Andrew Plotkin, look good. Matt was
two years younger than Zarf when he did "Detective", Zarf being 14 when he did
"Inhumane". Personally, I like "Inhumane". It's a fun diversion for a few
minutes. "Detective", unfortunately, cannot even claim that.
91520: Andrew's gone on to much bigger and better things, such as "So Far" and
"Space Under the Window". Matt didn't. A shame, really, as he obviously learnt
from his mistakes.
91712: Property value not routine or string: "

92252: To view a footnote, type "FOOTNOTE #", where # is the number of the
footnote you wish to read.
92330: manual' in this game means "manual pronoun assignment", which is the
process of assigning 'it', 'them', 'her', and 'him' only to objects that you
type. If it is off, the objects in the same room as you or that you are
carrying will be assigned pronouns after an 'inventory' or 'look' command. To
use it, type 'manual pronouns on' or 'manual pronouns off'. It defaults to on.
92602: You can't go northeast from here!
92630: You can't go northwest from here!
92658: You can't go southeast from here!
92686: You can't go southwest from here!
92716: Limbo is a special room, not intended to be visited.
92834: 3 am. I want you to solve it before we get any bad publicity or the FBI
has to come in. "Yessir!" You reply. He hands you a sheet of paper. Once you
have read it, go north or west.
92968: You are in a closet. There is a gun on the floor. Better get it. To
exit, go east.
93032: You are outside in the cold. To the east is a dead end. To the west is
the rest of the street. Papers are blowing around. It's amazingly cold for this
time of year.
93152: You are still on the streets. To the north is a restraunt where the
mayor ate often. To the east is the Mayor's home.
93236: You are about to enter the restraunt when two guys jump you. They take
your wallet and beat you a bit. Then you flash your badge and that riles them.
Your body was discovered in a river 10 miles away.
93376: You are in the house, at the scene of the crime. You enter and flash
your badge before a cop. He admits you. To the north is the upstairs. To the
east is the living room and to the west is the dining room.
93520: You are in the dining room. You look around and see a note on the table.
You can go back east.
93588: You are standing in the living room. You see a battered piece of wood.
You wonder "Should I pick this thing up?". Well, whether you do or don't the
only way out of the room is back west.
93724: You are in the hallway of the large house of the mayor. It is an
amazingly large house. You can go north, south, east or west.
93816: You are in a closet. The closet is of the walk in variety, with about
thirty pairs of tennis shoes, ten pairs of heels and about ninety coats and
shirts. You start to get claustrophobia. Better get out.
93960: You are in the first bathroom, out of the 5 there is. You notice that it
is almost as big as your apartment. You see a knife on the floor here.
94064: You are at the end of the hallway. To the north is a room, while to the
west is the rest of the hallway.
94140: You are in a closet. There is no reason to be in here. Go south.
94188: You are in the hallway. To the north is more hallway, and to the east is
a door marked "Guests".
94386: while comfortably propped up in bed. You see nothing of intrest, you
should go west.
94448: You are STILL in the hallway. There is EVEN MORE hallway to the north,
and a room to the west and a room to the east of you.
94544: You are in a closet. There is no reason to be in here. Go west.
94592: You are in a small closet. The room is bare. Why not go east and get
back to the situation at hand?
94664: You are still in the hallway. You can go north to where there is a
police officer who will let you outside, or you can go east or west.
94760: You are in a guest room. You see that there isn't much here, the
murderers ransacked the room. You can go west.
94840: You are in the bedroom. You noticed that there was a guard guarding the
stairs to the 3rd story, because there is remodelling going on there. You see
nothing of importance. Go east.
94968: You pass the guard. He nods at you. You are now outside standing on the
street. You can go north and east, your choice. To the north is more of the
street, and to the east is a video store.
95104: You are at a dead end. You can go south or west. Which way?
95148: You are in the so called "Murderers Lounge". Unfortunately, there ARE
murderers here, and when you check around, they get angry. But, that's life. Ya
lose!
95268: You are in a video store called Brickbuster Video. There are about 3,000
videos here. You can go north, or east.
95352: You are in the backroom of Brickbuster Video. You see a small video on
the floor, but you dismiss it as having no potential value to the crime. You
can go south.
95468: You are still in the video store. You can go north, or east.
95512: You are in a closet. There is no use for being here. Gotta go south.
95564: You are outside. You can go north, south, east or west.
95608: You are in a McDonalds. You pay the guy behind the counter. Now there is
a hamburger there. When you have picked it up, go north.
95704: You enter the house. A man charges down the stairs. Before you even have
time to say anything, he shoots you. You lose!
95792: You are still outside. You hit a dead end, then notice that you can go
east only.
95852: You are in a music store. You ask the man behind the counter if he knew
any information. "Uhh... nope! But the guy back there might be able ta help."
You politly thank him and head to the back. You can only go north.
96008: You are in the back of the music store. You ask the guy who's looking at
the cool tapes. He looks up at you. "Duh.. no... don't t'ink so... lemme
see..." You decide that he's no help. To the west there is a dazed looking man
and to the north there is an exit.
96200: You walk over to the guy. He jumps up with a wild look, and says
"Freeze!". You stop. He motions you to the exit. But you know he'll probably
just kill you. You NEED to get the weapon from him or kill him. Best chance:
use your gun.
96428: <HICKUP>.". You just walk away. You can go north, east or west. Your
call.
96494: You are in a druggies house.
Guys look over at you. "Hey! It's a cop!
Get 'im!" One yells.
They all grab their guns and aim' em at you. When the
police find you 2 days later, you are scattered across the room - literally.
96868: You are in the 3rd precinct police station. This isn't your station. You
get admitance from the guy at the desk and go to the holding cells. You ask
each offender if they know anything. You promise a lighter sentence for the
ones who help. But one guy really sets you straight. "I got caught wit' t'ree
ounces o' crack. I'm supposed to get 20 years but I'll be out in 2. You can't
make me talk cuz it don't matter to me. If I squeal, da guys who did it are
gonna come lookin' for me. I know but I ain't gonna tell ya. Now git outta my
face.". You are surprised but used to it. You can go north to the outside,
south to go back to the alley and west or east to talk to more guys.
97356: You are talking to more guys. But none of them tell you what you want.
You can only go east.
97424: You are talking to more guys. But none tell you what you need to know.
You can only go west.
97504: it's bitter cold and you pull your jacket around yourself. To the north
is a nice, warm Holiday Inn hotel, where the killer is rumoured to be staying.
Or you could go to his favourite hang out, the Wall, to the west, or to the
east is the place where he is supposed to be working, the Doughnut King.
97716: You don't see him here. You ought to go east.
97752: You are in the Doughnut King, where the greasiest doughnuts on earth
reside. He isn't here, no one seems to be for that matter, so you should go
west.
97860: You are in the Holiday Inn registration room. You talk to some
suspicious guys, but they don't talk until you hold your gun to their side.
"Alright! Alright! I'll talk! He's on the 15th floor! That's all I can tell
ya!" You shove them away. You walk up to the registration desk and show the
woman there your badge. She gives you the master ring. You now have access to
all of the facilitys on the 15th floor. But the problem is that the 15th floor
is the suite level, and there are 30 suites, and 5 pools, 2 saunas and 5 game
rooms. Big problem! Well, you have all night. You get a picture of all on the
15th floor, the people up there have to show their drivers license to be
admitted, and the license is secretly xeroxed. You look at them all. Well,
better get started. You see one person who stands out. You get his room number
from the lady. Room 30. Now you have to find it. To get started, go north.
98516: You go up the elevator. When you step out, you see the wallpaper is
pink, with little flowers on it. You can go east or west.
98608: You hit a dead end. There is a fire extinguisher here, but it is of no
importance to you. You can only go west.
98688: You are in the hallway. You see many doors...
98724: boy, you have a long way to go. You can only go north.
98764: You are still in the hallways. You can go west or east.
98804: You are at a dead end. There is nothing to do but go west.
98848: You are in the hallway. You see numbers flash by as you run through the
halls.
98936: You are in the hallway. You feel the heat from the sauna to the west,
and to the east is a door marked "Pool A". To the north is more hall.
99036: You are in the sauna when from the steam steps the killer.
"So ya
thought ya could get me eh?" He flashes a gun. Well, let's not get into
details.
You lose.
99152: You are in the pool when the killer shoots you from behind. You lose!
99204: You enter room 30... after a harrowing gun battle you conk him on the
head and take him in. You get promoted and suddenly, with the "Jurrasic Park"
theme song playing in your head, you feel proud to be an American. For special
info about Exile Games, and to leave this darned game, go up.
99788: That's difficult unless your eyes are prehensile.
99824: He is a dazed guy. He says "One more minute mom!"
99864: The dazed man seems to calm down for a moment, but suddenly attacks. Its
mouth opens to reveal teeth grotesquely out of proportion to the rest of its
body, a fact you notice as those same teeth tear your flesh into tiny pieces.
100020: The dazed man seems to be getting angrier!
100052: You aim the black pistol at the dazed man and pull the trigger. It's a
direct hit! The dazed man screeches angrily, and writhes in agony and fades
away in a cloud of green smoke.
100176: The black pistol soars through the air toward the dazed man. It's a
direct hit! The dazed man screeches angrily and writhes in agony as he fades
away in a cloud of green smoke.
100720: It is a piece of white paper.
100744: It is a small black pistol. It has 10 bullets in it. You must use them
wisely.
100802: The note was written on a computer obviously this murder was planned
and it says:
We have acclaimed Justice! The Justice of the future! Our next hit
is the governer! You CAN'T STOP US! The note sounds like the killers are a
group and that they are vigilantes (look it up). You are now getting a bit
worried.
101032: It is a note. With writing on it.
101060: You look at it closely and figure that the guys in the forensic's lab
would be better at this than you.
101132: The hamburger slides down your throat, and your stomach quickly is
full.
101184: It is a hamburger. If you eat it you'll have satisfied that little
hunger in your stomach. Go north.
101292: %BEveryone%P should know just how bad "Detective" is. There are some
IF-ers out there who have never played an AGT game, and so only know
"Detective" from it's MiSTing. So, I stripped out the commentary and created
this.
101464: Be under no illusions - this is a %U%Rvery%P bad game. It's not a
serious thing, this, it is just to compare it with the original AGT version, my
MiSTing, and the AGT port of the MiSTing.
101612: I had the (mis)fortune to play the original game a few years back,
still rather naive and new to the IF scene. I %Bhated%P the game. I found Mr.
Cree's port of the MiSTing (then maintained by C.E.Forman), and that introduced
me to the idea of taking the mick out of games.
101816: Of course, some may take the view that porting "Detective" to the
Z-Machine is a crime with a punishment worse than death. I say "No, it isn't.",
and for the reasons I list above and below.
101956: This game is pretty close to the original, barring the Inform parser.
The Inform parser doesn't help the game, though, just the player.
102056: "Detective" could have been much better than it is. Unfortunately, it's
painfully obvious Matt Barringer put %Bno%P effort into planning out this game,
and %Balmost%P no effort in writing it.
102204: There are one-way doors, there are objects still described after you've
picked them up, there are objects you can see but not interact with, and there
are atrocious spelling and grammar mistakes.
102340: For an example of how %Unot%P to write an adventure game, look no
further.
102400: However, bad as "Detective" is... there are %Bworse%P games out there.
Much, %U%Bmuch%P worse than this one.
102520: Born in a hospital in Worcester (on May 26, 1977), currently I live in
West Malvern.
102684: I looked at it, played with it, but ultimately I replaced it with
Inform. It was version 5.5, and it had no manual. I struggled on with it,
learning until I gained a basic understanding of the language. I got Inform
6.15 (with all the mod-cons) as soon as I could. And I am %Bvery%P glad I did.
103164: om%P is available. I endeavour to reply to each and every e-mail I get.
Bug-reports and criticisms welcomed.
103244: Watch out for further IF projects!
