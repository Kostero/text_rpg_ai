53685: Nothing to do!
53720: o. You have won
53819: It is now pitch dark in here!
53846: I beg your pardon?
53910: Sorry, that can't be corrected.
53939: Think nothing of it.
53992: As good-looking as ever.
54024: You can hardly repeat that.
54049: You can't begin with a comma.
54163: I didn't understand that number.
54192: You can't see any such thing.
54228: You aren't holding that!
54270: I'm not sure what "
54322: That's not a verb I recognise.
54351: That's not important here.
54377: You can't see "
54485: Nothing to do!
54502: There are none at all available!
55400: Please answer yes or no.
55426: Are you sure you want to quit?
55471: Failed.
55491: Restore failed.
55536: Save failed.
55551: Ok.
55595: Transcripting is already on.
55661: Transcripting is already off.
55719: Score notification on.
55740: Score notification off.
55763: You have visited:
55791: Objects you have handled:
55816: None.
56196: You are carrying nothing.
56245: Taken.
56256: You are always self-possessed.
56783: Dropped.
56891: Removed.
57030: You lack the dexterity.
57107: Done.
57369: Done.
57599: Wrahn seem interested.
58128: You stand.
58244: You can't go that way.
58738: But it's dark.
58755: You find nothing of interest.
58789: But it's dark.
58880: You find nothing of interest.
59984: . Not bad.
60000: That was a rhetorical question.
60054: That seems unnecessary.
60077: Keep your mind on the game.
60100: What a good idea.
60119: You smell nothing unexpected.
60146: You hear nothing unexpected.
60171: You taste nothing unexpected.
60206: Keep your hands to yourself!
60231: You feel nothing unexpected.
60256: If you think that'll help.
60365: Oh, don't apologise.
60395: Quite.
60406: Violence will not aid you here.
60456: Surprised?
60496: You achieve nothing by this.
60584: You wave, feeling foolish.
60730: You are unable to.
60749: Nothing obvious happens.
60799: That's not a direction.
60822: Not that way you can't.
60854: Keep your hands to yourself.
60879: You achieve nothing by this.
60912: Futile.
60941: You talk to yourself a while.
60966: This provokes no reaction.
60994: There is no reply.
61011: Nothing is on sale.
61030: Your singing is abominable.
61064: Time passes.
72578: Dropped into the dark.
72635: o. You have won
82986: It's already unlocked!
83080: The door is closed.
84966: You'll have to be more specific.
86149: It's empty.
88336: It's not empty.
89175: It's a little brackish, maybe.
89198: The water is clear.
89221: It's wet.
89236: It'd slip between your fingers.
89294: Tasteless.
89397: You stir around the water.
89471: You drop the egg into the water.
89698: The ice is solid.
89741: You do not even scratch it.
89870: Cold.
89886: Coffee-flavoured.
89904: Tasteless.
89913: Your tongue peels away again.
89940: It has an ice smell.
89961: The ice is too hard to snap.
90158: The ice melts clean away.
90622: The foil bag makes a poor cup.
90664: That would just be messy.
90754: Are you mad?
90794: The petrol boils away rapidly.
91540: Are you crazy?
92814: So it would appear.
92829: You nearly had me fooled.
92931: "Hello there, young man."
93097: "Excellent!" Giles bleats.
93136: "Are you sure?"
94210: It is on.
94222: And there was light.
94246: It's off right now.
94270: The torch switches off.
94323: Right now, it's broken.
94348: Right now it's off.
94459: No point getting it wet.
94520: There's no entrance here.
94557: It's solid stone.
94576: UL.
94598: The marble is cold.
95078: That doesn't fit the lock.
95168: You use your fist instead.
95459: It fits, but not to any purpose.
95490: How strange.
95501: The crack is too thin.
95605: Nothing happens.
95843: The needle would snap.
95996: Down steps? Not a chance.
96057: Stairs that way - no good.
96278: It's quite horrible.
96354: You step onto the river.
96454: There is the icy river below.
96482: It's frozen into the river.
96509: The barrel's empty now.
96568: The metal is too strong for you.
96732: . And you spill
97092: Cold!
98028: The stone is very cold.
98156: It's pretty cracked-up now.
98179: The stone is tougher than that.
98469: Ow!
98548: The laces are tight.
98567: Don't bother untying them.
98643: Rglxnwest.
98919: You wander over to them.
99142: The vent is quite hot.
99470: . To the south is a pantry.
99559: Donk.
99578: There is a broken oven there.
99644: That would have little effect.
99745: The oven is black inside.
100492: They are afraid.
100618: Don't go carting them around.
100776: The shutter has no keyhole.
100906: You can barely reach it now.
101024: Silence.
101051: Its door hangs open.
101103: Nothing happens.
101201: That wouldn't fit in the slot.
101678: It's frozen rigid.
101715: The robot is totally inert.
101789: It is held down by a bung.
101848: It's part of the robot.
101880: The bung is in the way.
102031: This panel is open.
102074: The door does not budge.
102102: There is no keyhole.
102223: It already is!
103084: There is a little light here.
103283: You get off the crate.
103309: You get off the desk.
103335: You hop down onto the crate.
103517: The button is out of reach.
103551: Click. Nothing happens.
103632: You collect your torch first.
103824: It is closed.
104030: Iqxn A red light glows on its front.
104353: Connecting that does nothing.
104401: The clips hang loose.
104476: You unclip the clips.
104695: There is a chime from the desk.
105000: You can't reach it from here.
105237: Nothing.
105246: It is humming quietly.
105286: It is way out of reach.
105373: Nothing more there.
105776: It's well out of your reach.
105831: The stone is firm.
105856: Hf.
105964: The can sloshes.
106000: The can rattles.
106056: That would be madness, surely.
106250: . There is darkness beyond.
106542: Darkness.
106555: It's too high up.
106628: Very firm under your fingers.
106660: North or south? Up or down?
106704: It's fixed.
106944: It's large, and heavy.
107340: The jars are closed, thankfully.
107440: You step onto the river.
107787: Don't clutter it.
107805: You replace the foil brick.
107901: The crate is far too heavy.
108084: You step onto the river.
108237: It's hot.
108372: No point getting it wet.
108422: It's fixed to the boiler.
108502: No luck. The power is off.
108543: It is buried deep in the stone.
108601: Don't disturb him.
108696: You find in his pocket, a key.
108737: He looks peaceful right now.
108766: It's a little to late for that.
109201: He's dead.
109689: He is wearing his shoes.
109711: He is not wearing any shoes.
109789: He's dead.
109827: You don't need it.
110182: Well - forget Mulldoon, then.
110342: Sharp.
110353: That would be unwise, surely.
110457: You must be joking.
110711: Don't go spoiling it.
110759: A door.
110766: Just shadows.
110878: You return to the foyer.
111016: They're out of reach.
111060: They're not designed for bipeds.
111170: It doesn't appear to open.
111198: It doesn't seem to move around.
111276: "I can't do that right now."
111318: "I THINK NOT," he booms.
113672: "Are you sure, then?"
113789: He's too heavy to lift.
113999: That could never work!
114122: You've already got him skewered.
114184: That would hardly be fair.
114323: That would hardly be fair.
114418: Giles is unresponsive.
114505: Giles is unresponsive.
115017: Giles' eyes flip open briefly.
115322: Giles ignores you.
115439: "They're closed. So are we."
115670: "MINE MINE MINE MINE!"
115717: k,"This way is not open to you."
115798: He's dead.
115809: Hi there.
116245: You scramble higher.
116286: You leap to the ground.
116396: Dropped.
116452: You're stood on it already.
116800: There's no way down any more!
116901: Dropped.
117116: You are stood on it already.
117171: But you're carrying it!
117199: It's six feet long!
117290: You swing open the car door.
117316: Cnpxn...Are you quite finished?
117526: You're in it.
117553: Time to go, maybe?
117867: . It is just like the others.
118006: The belt is fastened.
118021: The belt is loose.
118071: The belt is already fastened.
118095: You fasten the belt.
118126: The belt is already unfastened.
118152: You unfasten the belt.
118517: The ground is hard earth.
118580: You wait a while.
118655: It is part of the wall.
118808: The moss is cold but tasteless.
118835: The only smell is damp.
118951: You do not smell a breeze.
119314: They cannot hear you.
119333: They cannot see.
119363: They do not notice.
119391: Some fluid passes within.
119410: They are far from your reach.
119581: That wouldn't fit.
120104: Please. A fly egg?
120357: It's firmly stuck.
120465: Very hard.
120609: . It's empty.
120622: It is sealed.
120642: You tear open the bag easily.
120672: Very soft.
120701: The foil would make a poor cup.
120762: It is open.
120792: You can't close it.
120888: Giles is right beside you.
120937: You have no-one to follow.
121310: The dispenser is pretty solid.
121544: That's part of the dispenser.
121785: It's sturdy enough.
121851: That doesn't fit in the slot.
122577: There is no dial to control it.
122606: You would not want to break it.
122635: You do not want to lose it.
122671: The metal is hot.
122719: The lens lights up, briefly.
122813: The man is here in front of you.
123105: It is bright outside, daytime.
123146: It is black.
123169: It is too high up.
123184: It's out of your reach.
123350: You need a tool.
123370: Your tool is poor.
123417: It is just an image.
123468: It is getting ever darker.
123489: It is brilliant white.
123527: It is just intangible light.
124484: The curtains are closed.
124818: Thick velvet curtains. They are
124902: I was enjoying the view!"
124921: At least I have some view!"
124950: You spread the curtains wide.
125101: You are in the curtain already.
125476: The General does not notice.
125634: Coalhill - 1485.
125657: Basingstoke - 1496.
125704: Waterloo - 1974.
125835: You can't find that battle.
126012: His eyes mere paint-dabs now.
126057: He looks at you intently.
127425: . What was the year?"
128492: You nod your head.
128595: "Well, then, tell me!"
128614: "I see you, boy. Hello!"
128640: You shake your head.
128932: You mumble an apology.
128951: You leap back in surprise.
128988: He's hung quite securely.
129034: k."Now stop that this instant!"
129507: The General is not looking.
130109: Clump. Dropped.

134836: As with The Mulldoon Legacy, there is one final puzzle (though it's
somewhat easier): Find another way past Giles, in the stone tunnel near the end
of the game.
135084: "The Mulldoon Legacy"
135804: bringing back Mr. Mulldoon
136104: Score:
136112: Moves:
136120: Time:
136128: You can't go that way.
136452: Please give one of the answers above.
136480: [You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
136516: [Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
136552: "Oops" can only correct a single word.
136580: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
136612: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
136668: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
136712: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
136752: I didn't understand that sentence.
136812: You seem to have said too little!
136836: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
136872: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
136908: You excepted something not included anyway!
136940: You can only do that to something animate.
136972: I didn't understand the way that finished.
137004: Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which exactly?
137156: Are you sure you want to restart?
137180: The game file has verified as intact.
137204: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupt.
137244: Attempt to begin transcript failed.
137272: Attempt to end transcript failed.
137296: You're carrying too many things already.
137328: You can't put something on top of itself.
137360: You can't put something inside itself.
137388: You feel strangely full, that's true enough.
137420: That would scarcely empty anything.
137476: You can only get into something free-standing.
137508: But you aren't in anything at the moment.
137536: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
137572: is now in its "brief" printing mode, which gives long descriptions of
places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
137664: is now in its normal "verbose" mode, which always gives long
descriptions of locations (even if you've been there before).
137748: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
137848: An absence of light to see by.
137920: This dangerous act would achieve little.
137948: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
137980: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
138012: Digging would achieve nothing here.
138040: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
138064: You would achieve nothing by this.
138088: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
138116: But there's no water here to carry.
138144: Real private eyes do not need such language; they use sarcasm instead.
138196: There's not enough water to swim in.
138220: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
138248: That would be less than courteous.
138272: Is that the best you can think of?
138296: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
138336: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
138368: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
138420: You are blind by dark, and see nothing more than powders and shifting
hazy grey.
138476: You are a private eye, and a good one at that. You're dressed in your
usual fashion.
138536: You'll have to specify what you want to fill up with.
138632: A key would be a start, at least.
138672: You cannot find a way in that direction.
138700: There is something blocking the way that you cannot see.
138736: You submerge the coffee powder in water.
138764: The powder spits up with a Foom! and is lost.
138796: The sawdust absorbs up the liquid greedily.
138824: You can't really dip things there.
138848: That wouldn't help your taking it at all.
138880: You can't fill anything from there!
138908: There's no liquid to fill anything with here.
138940: You can't fill anything from there!
138968: It'd be a long process getting rid of it all, and a pointless one too.
139020: It would slip through your fingers.
139076: The water freezes hard onto the ice.
139102: The water turns a murky brown, and gives off a rich smell. You've made
coffee.
139160: The water bubbles vigorously, with great billows of steam.
139312: freezes solid into ice. Incredible!
139340: At the bottom of the water is a heap of coffee.
139372: The water has a dark and murky coffee flavour.
139404: That wouldn't make a good stirrer.
139432: The coffee doesn't mix in, just moves around in a sludge.
139472: The water freezes hard onto the ice.
139496: A little water evaporates at the spark.
139568: It is sweating, ever-so-slightly.
139596: Inside you can just see something orange.
139624: It's frozen to a dirty-brown colour.
139652: It is extremely cold on your tongue, almost a non-sensation. Then you
realise your tongue has gone numb, and you take the ice quickly away.
139744: You further the cool the oven, though it doesn't need it.
139784: You place the ice-lump on the oven handle, and it sizzles sharply,
sending up a wave of steam. But the ice is frozen very solid indeed, and is
only half-melted by the time the handle has cooled right down.
140096: . A moment later a thin haze of ash rises.
140128: Do you need more? Where's it all gone, anyway?
140224: Something is bobbing in the water.
140248: A few objects are submerged in the water.
140288: Soft brown powder - instant coffee.
140316: The coffee is mingled in the water now.
140344: The coffee is mingled in the water now.
140372: The sparker fires, a little coffee ash twirls upwards.
140408: You dab your tongue on it - and it tastes very sour indeed.
140448: Thick black petrol.
140464: It would most likely explode if you did.
140492: You feel a jolt and hear the bang, and that's it.
140528: The blue powder gums onto the ice.
140552: A spark leaps across the sparker, and touches the powder and both quite
quietly vanish, as if cancelling out.
140628: You touch the powder with a fingertip - and you feel a pinprick of
numbness on the skin. When you look, there is a fine blue-black dot there.
140724: You dab your tongue onto the powder - and the tip goes completely numb.
And stays that way.
140786: The metal of the flue is so hot the blue powder burns, becoming nothing
but smoky ash.
140860: A fine blue powder.
140880: A handful of sawdust.
140896: A few grains of sawdust frazzle and drift away at the spark, ashen.
140944: The sawdust has gummed to the ice quite firmly.
140976: It would slip through your fingers.
141008: Thick black coffee.
141024: Ah - heated by sparker! You get that at all the best coffee-bars.
141072: It smells heady, and wakes you up a little.
141104: You saw how much coffee is in there. If you drink that, you'll not
sleep for a week! (Not to mention, you know where the water you used came from
too.)
141206: The coffee is boiling away nicely - good and hot.
141292: A thick, sloshing chemical.
141312: A little potion evaporates at the spark.
141340: It has a slightly sweet smell, like a flower.
141372: And shaking... you take a sip, cursing yourself with every movement of
your hand. It tastes like cherryade. For a moment you notice no change, and
then suddenly the room around you blurs...
141500: You liked it so much last time? A little more confidant, you take
another slug.
141556: Maybe this stuff is not lethal, but it seems like it's addictive.
141604: You take another shot of the purple gunk, and your head spins.
141648: And again.
141660: But the world here is dark, still, though now that dark is thicker,
blacker, more like shifting tar than simple non-light. And through it your
heart beats faster,
141788: and something is coming to get you. The thing is like a nightmare that
lives beneath your skin. It is a horrible, horrible half-hour-day before you
feel the effects wearing off and you resurface, into a friendlier dark around
you.
141940: The world is a montage of pink and blue.
141972: And then gradually, the real world settles back around you again.
142016: Slowly, the world resettles.
142036: It takes a moment, but eventually you feel well again.
142074: It seems that knock was too much. The torch bulb flicks out.

You are
in darkness.
142132: A violent explosion rocks the floor!
142158: There is a colossal clang from the bottom of the oven, which
reverberates a while.
142216: A lump of stone rockets out of the hole in the floor and clobbers you
straight on the temple. Everything goes quite black.
142300: You nearly had me fooled, you know.
142324: "BYEBYEBYEBYE," Giles chants at you. "IT'S CLOSING TIME NOW."
142392: "HIHIHIHI," Giles chirrups like a six-foot songbird.
142436: "I see," Giles says with eyes closed.
142468: "Well then, ask away ask away," Giles replies, his arms waving out to
the sides as he blurs around the room.
142544: "GOING GOING GOING," comes the booming response.
142588: "Yes, you want me to get you coffee?"
142616: "So you want coffee?"
142632: "You are indecisive!" Giles giggles. "Do you want coffee?"
142676: "No, you're not sure you don't want me to get coffee?"
142716: "So you are sure you want don't want me to get coffee?"
142760: "We will become one, for the greater good"
142920: It is cold here.
142932: You shiver, feeling a breeze.
142956: The air around picks and moves, just a little.
142988: A chill wind blows over you from the north.
143020: A breeze drifts around you, tingling-frozen.
143052: You feel a stir of chilly air from the north.
143084: You shiver.
143096: Uneven ground crunches underfoot.
143120: There is a red dot in the far distance, and all the rest is dark.
143164: There is no moon, no stars, and now no torch. All around is soft
darkness, in the shadow of building and wall.
143240: Without your torch for light, all you see is powdery darkness.
143708: A nice, sleek black number with a real sharp light.
143744: The sundial time-telling days are over.
143772: It seems, then, it is half past four.
143800: You don't want to lose it in the dark.
143828: You rattle it around, but to no avail.
143856: The torch rattles a little. It's perhaps not that sturdy, so you stop.
143904: You dance torchlight madly around the walls.
143936: It seems broken, or the power has gone.
143964: Everything falls dark around you.
143988: Standard issue to the cops, and on retirement you get a nice silver one
like this - or you did, anyway, and the Chief is unlikely to miss it as he
never looked in that drawer much. It's basically a long thin metal blade, with
various hooks, knobs and twiddles in it. Visualize it as a post-modern-art
nailfile.
144248: The steps are the same. From atop them you see a white glow, shining
from the dragon's pillar, but that is all.
144324: The steps to the imposing front of the museum lead up to the north,
shimmering orange in the reflection of the streetlamp's light. The facade is
dull and flat like a concrete tower block but for this portico, which has a
couple of sculptures. Here by your feet, for example, are a couple of stone
crocuses. Further up are some gargoyles on pillars.
144552: Leaving. Tempting. But you've got a job to do; in the museum, to the
north.
144608: The stone flowers are quite prettily carved, but haven't weathered well
- when the wind blows, rain would be swept onto them. One - the one on the left
of the stairs - is half-filled with rainwater, in fact, from the shower earlier
today.
144768: It's solid stone, but the water inside has a murky odour.
144808: The crocus is half-filled with water; its surface black in the
half-light.
144860: You're not here to steal the art.
144884: The water is cold, and a little brackish.
144912: "The Mulldoon Museum," says the A-Z. No-one seems to know what it's a
museum of, though; no-one even seems to know when it's open. Last visitor it
had appears to be the man you're looking for, who in turn was looking for the
museum's owner: the enigmatic Edgar Mulldoon. Last seen - two days ago, in a
supermarket.
145136: Hopefully you won't have to search the whole thing. It's massive.
145184: Much is the same still, the stone underfoot, the keypad, the doors. But
you notice motion either side of you, you sense light, and turn to see the
unicorn and dragon, carved on the pillars. They are alive, somehow. The dragon
glows with blinding white light from the crack that runs down his length. The
unicorn rallies its hoofbeats, as though riding on the spot. Their eyes seem to
glow.
145436: The museum doors are north.
145456: The doors are closed, and locked as well.
145484: The glass doors are in front - north, closed, locked.
145520: The glass has shattered before your blow. The museum is open to the
north.
145568: The steps to your south lead back to your car. The bushes you crawled
through earlier are to your east.
145636: The marble walls and floor have fallen into shadow from the overhang,
low over your head and near enough to touch. It is supported by two wide
pillars, one either side - carved with a dragon and a unicorn. Quaint. To the
north are the glass double doors of the place; there's a keypad in the wall by
them. Bushes grow right up to you to the east.
145864: There are no more stairs left to climb.
145892: There's nothing that way, just the front drive of the museum (and your
car, parked diagonally on it).
145960: The doors are like jet, and reflect your own haggard face, and the
leering statues either side.
146024: Through the door you can see the large packing crate; hulking like a
four-foot, very squat and fat guy.
146096: You see the road, the streetlights; the way out.
146130: Once more, the dartgun fires, and you stumble, heavily this time. The
world spins, slides like oil on water, like butter on a frying pan base, but
you don't care because you've fallen and the world is very black.

This time,
the nausea fades but you do not return from the darkness.
146320: You step through the doors. You hear a
146352: from above you and a feel sting in your neck. The dartgun --! You reach
up a hand, and pull out a half-inch needle, dripping purple, from your skin.
The world spins, shakes, shudders; you feel yourself about to faint.

Suddenly
the Christmas tree is moving inside the Foyer. The packing crate has vanished,
so has your car, it is raining. The stone crocuses look like urns in the dim
light. There are fairy lights and they are dark...

You stumble, the world
spins for time uncountable. Finally though, you wake. Panting, sweating,
crumpled in the doorway. The needle has vanished somewhere, rolled away from
your fingers.
146764: Giles is still completely in front of the door, right up against it,
and as you step near he swipes viciously at your legs with one hand. You leap
back and he growls.
146876: Giles is unflinching as you approach the door, ramming backward and
forward. You are less courageous, and do not want to get mown down. "
146968: IT'S CLOSING TIME!
147024: " he screams. You cannot get by here.
147052: They're firmly locked. You have no key.
147080: You ram your fingers into the gap and try to draw the doors open... but
no, they're firmly locked shut.
147152: The lockpick turns in the lock, but the mechanism doesn't seem to be
connected to the door, somehow, as nothing happens.
147232: The key turns, but does not catch the mechanism somehow. The doors
remain
147280: The glass fractures, falls into a thousand on the ground. The museum
lies open.
147332: So Mulldoon is dead. There's still no good reason to go around,
vandalising his property.
147396: All right, so you could easily break the glass into a million pieces
like that. But paying for the damage will cost more than your paycheck.
147488: You don't have anything firm enough to break the glass. Besides; paying
that back to miserly old Mr. Mulldoon will cost more than his grandson's wife
is paying you.
147604: The bushes form a sprawling wall from the eastern edge of the museum
portico, down to the road, where the outer wall curves around to the north and
east. Here, though, they're scraggly; losing their leaves, like a hedgerow in
Transylvania. Through them you can just about see the other side.
147796: The hedge is thick, and wiry, tough and strong like your old Mom. So
much so, you can't uproot it.
147864: You water the hedges. The wood just soaks it up moodily, refusing to
get any healthier.
147924: The stumpy runts don't go anywhere.
147948: Enough of the games, enough of the crawling. Enough of it. You blew up
a sculpture room, after all. There's nothing to stop you walking in.
148042: You crash through the bushes. What a life.
148076: The unicorn is exceptionally well-carved: tossed mane, coiling horn,
reared hoofs ever-so-slightly-cleft, and little sparks of spittle at the jaws.
The dragon was perhaps once well carved too, but it has caught the rain, and
cracked horribly along the front. It looks like the work of water and frost,
splitting it open.
148292: They are up the steps, to the north.
148316: The stone is cold under your lips. You hope no-one on the street was
watching, too.
148372: You hit the stone, and unsurprisingly, it's your hand that gets hurt.
148420: A crack as thin as a hair? You'd need to take a serious diet-program to
do that.
148480: The crack is just a frost-crack. You know: water gets in, water
freezes, stone breaks. It's nothing exciting.
148584: Is it just you, or is the stone really, really cold? Good thing you
didn't lick it.
148644: You aren't going to be so dumb, as to waste your time, having every
comment you make in thick-tongued-speak.
148720: The keypad looks a little dead: its screen is dark.
148756: The keypad has a little one-line screen - dark - and four buttons:
CALL, SELECT, OTHER and DISPLAY. You get the strange feeling that if this came
with a manual, it would be in Japanese-only.
148904: There are no contacts visible that you could power up.
148940: Nothing. The keypad seems to be dead. Maybe the power is off inside.
148988: There's no clear way to do that; and by the darkness of the museum, the
problem may be further inside.
149056: You bang hard on the keys, and they dent, ever-so-slightly.
149100: You tug, but the pad is securely fastened into the wall.
149138: A 3-foot-cube packing crate sits here on the step, unopened.
149184: Dim light escapes through cracks in the slats of wood.
149220: Stencilled across one side is: "FRAGILE". However, the crate looks
pretty sturdy - it could take your weight if you jumped on it. And getting it
open would probably require some major flame-thrower. Or just a screwdriver;
depending how cinematic you feel.

It could probably be dragged around, too.
149432: It probably wouldn't be wise to open it under you.
149468: You cannot see through the sides - the little cracks are all welled
with light.
149524: You wipe at a little of the sawdust, and get a splinter, so stop.
149568: It's too wide and heavy to carry.
149592: You'd need something sharp to lever it open with.
149628: Your lockpick is pretty stumpy really, and can't fit in the cracks.
149676: You try... but it's no good. The gnomon simply isn't long enough for
you to get a decent leverage on the slats of the crate to force them apart, and
isn't thin enough to wedge inside.
149800: You slide the chisel blade between two slats, and with great effort,
force the wood apart until it sunders. Light leaps from the gap, making your
eyes water. You attack further, ripping out more wood, with the glow growing
stronger as more escapes. Eventually, you are amidst a pool of debris with the
crate's contents -
150016: That wouldn't get the crate open.
150040: You bang heavily at the wood, but it's sterner than that.
150080: Don't go clambering around in the dark.
150108: The crate slides - not easily, but it slides. Perhaps if you had a
direction in mind?
150168: Through the hedge? Camel. Eye of needle. Work it out.
150208: The door is too thin for the crate.
150232: The top is covered in a film of sawdust.
150260: The top is smeared in a thick black sludge.
150292: You hop up onto the crate, and think: "You dirty rascal," in your best
James Cagney.
150352: You mix the petrol and the thick layer of sawdust to create a black,
sludy lump.
150408: The sawdust is a thin covering over the top of the crate; which is to
say, you find the top of the crate there.
150480: The top of the crate is sprinkled over with sawdust.
150516: Thick, oily, sludge.
150560: It would slip through your fingers.
150584: You feel a jolt and hear the bang, and that's it.
150620: Suddenly you are hemmed in, by bushes on the west side, the museum
building to the north, and a tall wall to the south. Your torch light flicks
around the space, dragging a lit circle with makes your eyes sting; flecking on
the unkempt grass under your feet.
150792: The ice upon the river is gone - and a watercourse laps at your feet
with simple elegance in its curves. From nowhere, a grate now covers the wall
of the museum, thin and rusting. Otherwise - the tall wall, the monolith of the
museum - they are all the same.
150960: The bushes are west, and the path continues - beyond the river - to the
east.
151012: The wall is far too high to scale.
151036: There's no way into the museum from here.
151064: Leaning near the river is a metal canister, the side ominously split.
151112: The canister has a logo and label reading: "MAXWELL'S SALT-DEMON". It
lies a touch too far off the ledge, but is frozen into and held up by the icy
river. That end is split open, the metal jaws twisted and ripped, and on closer
inspection is stained a pale blue. Apart from that, the barrel is empty.
151328: You spot a black oily sludge, on the river just under the canister.
151376: One end of the canister is sealed in by ice.
151436: The rent is permanent, it would seem.
151464: Is that what they taught you in narcotics?
151492: The crack is only thin. Besides, God knows what was in there.
151608: The ice is too solid. And you'd catch your death!
151644: The river is frozen solid. You couldn't get any water from there.
151688: Across the river runs a plank of wood.
151716: Gummed to the surface is a path of sawdust.
151748: You lay down the plank across the river.
151776: You sprinkle the sawdust over the ice, and it gums down.
151816: The ice is pretty solid, and cold. However hard you pummel you fail to
make any cracks.
151876: The river cuts the garden like a sword buried in a ribcage, running
from an arch in the wall to another into the museum. The water has, somehow,
frozen, which is curious - it's not that cold now, and it certainly wasn't
earlier either.
152032: is the dagger-blade of a stream, running through a low arch in the wall
under the museum itself. It has frozen solid
152112: . A thin path of sawdust has been laid down
152142: Across the river is laid a plank.
152276: Whoops! You collapse right into a heap, not getting anywhere across the
ice.
152372: The river is unfrozen, and the bushes to the southeast have become a
bower. The garden looks longer, and darker around the corner, more scary. You
are suddenly aware of how cold the night is, and how far away your car is.
152516: The gardens run west to northeast here, with a door into the museum to
the north.
152568: This a corner of the gardens, by a corner of the museum. Tangled bushes
grow in a heap in the pinch of the wall, starting right at the bed of the
frozen river to your west. The gardens continue - cold, dark, and who knows how
big - up rising ground to the northeast. A more comforting sight is the door to
the north, which leads inside.
152788: Just a clump of bramble, or something. There's nothing of interest in
there.
152840: You poke your head between the branches. Well, there are the ashes of a
fire tramped into the soil. Maybe someone had a picnic here, once. Under a thin
wood-wicker canopy, beneath the stars... stupid place to light a fire.
152992: The bushes aren't high enough for you to scale the wall, and you don't
even want to do that particularly.
153064: The door from the back of the museum to the gardens is green, and looks
vaguely like a shed door. And as such, it doesn't fit its frame properly, with
about an inch gap between the door and floor.
153196: The key is in the lock, on the other side.
153222: You push open the door, and something glints at you from above; a tiny
pin-prick red light. You squeeze your eyes - it's hard to focus in the gloom -
and make out a thin cylinder above the garden door. You recognise it. It is a
dartgun, like the device in the Foyer. You did not notice it earlier.

Hand
shaking, you reach to feel the back of your neck. Nothing. But further down -
in your upper arm, punched through your coat: there, a needle. You draw it out
with a sting, and the world wobbles around you. The waxworks seem to move -
they seem to be people, walking along a dusted street - and they freeze once
more. The hut flaps blow in a second's wind, given just a glimpse to live. Your
feet feel heavy. You look at the dartgun, at the needle with its purple-pointed
tip.
153744: What the hell is this god-forsaken place?
153776: You drop the things in your hands, and run. Run through the garden,
crash through the bushes, down the steps, over to your car.
153860: You can see the key in the keyhole as a shadow.
153892: Under the door you can see a key, which you take.
153924: The keyhole seems to be blocked with something - presumably it's the
key, on the inside.
153984: You'll need something to poke it out with.
154016: And lockpicks aren't like keys; you can't shove them in, they're
designed to slide around pins and wedge between things, and so won't be able to
grip or knock out the key.
154136: You shove in the chopstick and with a clink the key falls out on the
other side of the door.
154196: Well, it fits still. Doesn't do anything, though.
154232: You slip the garden key into the lock - but it doesn't turn!
154276: The grass turns into a path of small pebbles here, as it runs uphill in
a tight tunnel between the museum to your west and the perimeter wall. The path
branches, and twists in a figure-eight around two sculptures. The first is a
stone plinth - a sundial - looking more like a treestump in the dark. The
second took a while to notice. It's a mosaic, across the grass.
154516: The mosaic has erupted into colour! What was, before, just blank
squares - is now detailed drawings, art on the grass. You stare enraptured at
the images - a dark cell, a burning tower, a plan of planets; each picked out
in tiny stones in precision and finesse. When finally you raise your eyes the
sundial is telling you the time, using the shadow of shade for its mark.
154762: A glint of torchlight shines off the sharp point of the gnomon.
154808: Yeah! It's a rubbish mosaic, and deserves to be stomped upon!!
154856: There is no way into the museum from here.
154884: The wall is too high to scale.
154904: The path heads north-south here.
154928: . The stone is cracked by a webbing of ice, and without its gnomon its
more like a bird-bath than anything else.
155008: , with a sharp triangular gnomon. It reads no time, because it is
dark.

The stone around the gnomon is meshed with cracks.
155092: enough to lever apart stone. Which makes you wonder - how have the
cracks formed in the first place?
155220: You splash the water over the stone and powder. It freezes hard into
the cracks, already deep and dark.
155288: You splash water over the cracked stone and blue powder. It drains into
the cracks, freezing solid as it goes, and the ice forces apart the marble with
a searing noise. The surface parts in a pattern of collapsed hexagons. The
gnomon slips easily away and falls to the grass.
155468: into the cracks on the sundial stone. It collects in little pools, but
does not freeze like you might have hoped. Gradually, it dribbles away
155592: There are fine cracks around the base of the gnomon, which suggest it's
loose - but it's not loose enough to just tug out. You'd need to force them
open with something. You cast around for a lever - something thin, sharp -
something like the gnomon itself...
155768: The surface is now quite slippery, with all that ice.
155804: The gnomon looks a painful thing to fall on.
155836: A sharp metal triangular blade, about the size of your palm.
155876: It's pretty firmly fixed into the stone.
155904: You cast your eye over it, but in truth, it's a pretty rubbish mosaic.
It has no pictures at all, just four areas of colour. Yes, they're bright and
vivid - red and silver, that sort of thing - but rather dull. You wonder quite
why anyone would have bothered to collect that many coloured stones so
meticulously just for this.
156124: You step onto one of the quadrants of the mosaic.
156160: The stones are glues down firmly enough.
156200: Two shoes, empty, almost parallel but slightly splay. Just a couple of
inches apart, as far as if there were someone stood in them right now. There is
something odd, and it takes a moment to place - then you see it. The laces are
still done up, quite tightly. It's as though the wearer had just vanished. Of
course, someone has just slipped them off without unfastening them, but it's a
little eerie out here in the dark.
156480: Two shoes. Not your size, much bigger.
156508: They have lots of little holes, where the laces go, that would make
them bad for filling.
156568: You can't really shine worn rumpled leather, only peel it away.
156612: They'd make a pretty silly handbag.
156636: They're too big for you. Besides, you have shoes. Who would wander
around here without them, after all?
156708: And here is the far end of the garden, at the top of a hill which has
buried one floor of the museum beneath it. This spot is a cafe, though it can't
get much custom. The furniture is spartan - just one table - and shabby, mouldy
from being out in the rain. The wall to the east dimples to hold a group of two
trees, and then continues north until it curves to meet the wall of the museum.
156964: The river unfreezes and flows quietly, lit from above by a swirling red
vortex of light, like pictures of Jupiter just hovering quietly by the wall.
Otherwise, the Cafe is unchanged - still dingy, still unkempt, still rotting.
157116: There is the river, then the wall, and no way beyond.
157152: There is the river, then the wall, and no way beyond.
157188: There is a high wall there.
157208: The garden continues south, and there is a door to the west.
157248: The river forms a band of ice just by the north wall which joins to the
back of the museum, and lies just downhill to the north. There must be rocks
submerged or something, as the surface is cracked and broken into fist-sized
chunks.
157400: Past the cafe the land slopes down again, and the river re-emerges from
the museum, running along the bottom of the north wall and away. It is still
frozen solid, but the surface is cracked.
157528: Across the river is laid a plank, going nowhere really.
157568: That wouldn't be a good place to carry the ice.
157602: The surface of the river is covered in fist-sized chunks of ice.
157648: You've got enough ice already, surely.
157676: You pick up one of the chunks of ice. It's frozen solid, and doesn't
even wet on your fingers.
157788: You stand steady on your bridge. But there's nowhere to go from here.
157836: Tall beech trees growing side by side, their branches intertwining like
a chess-player's fingers.
157904: The furniture is old and beginning to grow lichen, but still as
comfortable as lightweight plastic chairs can be, I suppose.
157988: You look through the hole and see the ground.
158020: Well, they're not strictly too heavy to carry, but they're certainly
too bulky. And pointless.
158088: You sit briefly, but no-one comes to offer you a drink, so you stand up
again.
158144: The furniture shifts easily. So easily, you're surprised the weather
hasn't played more games with them.
158216: This is just a patch of long grass between the trunks of two large
beech trees, with the rest of the gardens back west, and the wall looping
around on all the other sides.
158328: The trees remained unchanged. The vent of the boiler room has sunk
though, like it were being viewed from very far away, to just a griddle on the
grass which leads somewhere darker. Then you leap back, as a pair of dark
shaded fingers reaches up between the bars ... they are hairy. "Brother,"
whispers a voice from below.
158544: The only way is back west.
158564: The trees are almost as tall as the museum, and scale up into the sky
beside you. It's a little like standing between a giant's legs.
158652: There are no branches low down enough to even try.
158688: And here's what the trees are covering - between them is a large metal
vent sticking two feet from the ground. It steams slightly - presumably it is
attached to a boiler in some underground room.
158820: Green metal, and a little like the funnel on a steamship. The very top
is a grille, but you can't really look down because of the steam and heat from
below. It's all pretty solid.
158940: It's hot here!
158954: The vent wisps with steam, a ghost of white in the night air.
159028: over the vent. With a sharp hiss, it boils away!
159064: There's too much heat floating out of the thing to make that wise.
159108: The grille is firmly closed - indeed, firmly welded down.
159148: The metal is all very securely welded together.
159180: There is a room down there, of course, but you can't really see through
the wisps of steam.
159258: chopstick. It'd be just a plain stick if it weren't for the pictograms
inscribed on the handle.
159404: The only way out is back east.
159424: Coils of grainy black smoke rise from the oven, and you smell them - it
is achingly familiar somehow. From behind you hear a quiet swish of wind in
leaves. Part of the wall has collapsed to the northwest.
159560: The small kitchen of the cafe is barren, understocked, and totally in
keeping with the age of the furniture back east. There is a single worktop, and
beneath this is a
159668: hole in the floor. Nearby is the oven, looking sullen
159704: The hole is far too small for you, and the drop far too far.
159744: There is a dark hole in the floor, just under the worktop. Perhaps the
bottom of the oven exploded away at some point.
159820: You pop your head through the door, but the pantry is empty.
159860: Plasticated wood.
159876: You don't feel like playing Igor today.
159908: There is a hole in the floor there.
159932: The door to the oven is shut, and blackened. It's set a little
cock-eye.
159984: The door hangs open like a drunk man's jaw. Inside it is black, as
though something had exploded in there.
160056: You pour water over the oven-handle, sending up a wave of steam.
160100: Of course, the oven isn't on, so wouldn't be any good for cooking.
160148: Do you look like a repairman? Well, perhaps - but that oven's beyond
your saving.
160208: Ow! The oven handle is blazing hot!
160236: There is a hole in the floor under the cooker.
160268: You've moved this oven about as far as you can.
160304: You push the oven back under the worktop.
160332: With great effort, you haul away the oven, revealing a hole in the
floor underneath.
160400: In doing so, the oven catches on the chopstick and pulls it away. It
tears just in time for you to see the other half of the pair of disposable
chopsticks falling away through the hole. It seems they were trapped either
side.
160548: You turn the cooker on, but nothing happens. Partly because the power
in this place seems to be off, and partly because the switches are hanging off
on broken springs.
160660: A hand-held sparker; a handle of plastic with two metal prongs.
160708: It seems to turn on intermittently, with no way of turning it off.
160754: You drop the sparker through the hole, and it lands below with a thick
splosh. Nothing else happens.
160826: From inside the ice comes a muted flash of blue.
161002: Your breath is baited, but all is quiet.
161036: You zap your tongue. A tear wells in your eye as a result.
161076: One puny spark isn't going to melt all that ice.
161110: Wait... wait... Ow!

There, happy?
161144: Sticking out from under the oven is a chopstick.
161180: The chopstick appears to be a caught on something.
161216: The chopstick comes away with a snap as you tug it free.
161256: Crick.
161264: You have the uncanny feeling that the waxworks have moved.
161304: Nothing seems to change. The figures are still the same, the hut also.
You have a sensation - in the corner of your eye - that something has
disappeared, but that is all.
161420: The waxworks leer at you in green-tinted light. They stand in strange
poses, some flinching, others hiding, all scared by the fall of rocks in the
room to the north, like a frozen tidal wave upon them. But enough of such
things. The door to the gardens is to the south, it is closed.
161604: Unsettling waxworks fill this squat room. In any other museum, they
would be against the walls, or behind glass; here they just mill around the
floor-space. A couple half-block the doorway to the north. Another is tying his
shoe-lace just by the
161772: door to the gardens. Most stand in a shambolic and arguing queue
outside a hut built against the east wall. They're watched by two fellows who
sit on a set of stairs heading west into a metal shutter. All faces are frozen,
and too-smooth in the shifting
161940: The floor is covered in tracks, like conveyor-belts, near invisible
black on black.
161996: That way is blocked with fallen stones.
162024: You fumble with something cloth but find no opening.
162060: Three poles of wood in a Stonehenge arch; cloth draped across the top
and then pinned up to the wall. It has the appearance of a small dark circus
tent. You could step easily inside - the waxworks won't notice you pushing in.
162212: The cloth will not move, it's only long enough to hang as it does.
162260: You could probably tear it down. But that's not really why you're here.
Maybe if you find you need a parachute, then you could get it.
162352: They are not all that lifelike - the painting of the faces uses far too
bland colours, and the sculpting is rough. Their clothes are good - real
leather, mostly; long tunics, sandalled shoes. But if there is anything curious
it is their poses. They are not captured doing things one would expect to see
in a museum. They look too ordinary. Some look bored. One is staring off into
space. Another appears to be halfway through explaining something to his
friend, who is not really listening. Hell, one of the men is staring at one of
the women from behind. It's as though they'd just frozen a crowd; and in the
half-light the effect is eerie.
162780: The figures fill the room in their various poses. The men in the queue
all seem to be clutching wax silver coins.
162852: The coins are firmly melded into the waxworks fists. Partly because
they, like the palms which do the gripping, are made of wax.
162936: The wax melts a little at the sparks. In fact, you notice one man has
his shoulder quite badly deformed in a similar way.
163016: A few men in the queue are carrying (painted) silver [wax] coins in
their fists.
163076: One has dropped a short twig under his sandal.
163108: The wax is pretty solid and hurts your knuckles.
163140: There is a sudden grating noise in the floor and the waxworks move,
sliding along tracks built into the floor and shifting their positions.
163232: It would take powers you don't have to do that.
163266: "Have you seen a kid called 'Mulldoon' round here?"

The waxwork
refuses to talk. Maybe you should bribe him.
163348: You're seriously trying to bribe a waxwork?!?
163384: The metal shutter to the west is impassive, and rolled down to the
floor.
163432: The shutter is rolled up into the ceiling, revealing a room to the
west.
163480: The shutter is like that already.
163504: You haul at the metal but cannot shift it.
163536: Without the tablet, you can't get it to move.
163568: The metal clangs loudly but does not bend.
163596: Nothing happens as you press the tablet.
163624: The shutter unrolls to the floor.
163648: The shutter rattles away into the ceiling.
163676: The garden key is made of brass.
163700: It's a brass key.
163716: The hut is only half a hut, cut down the middle by the bleak white wall
of the museum. Underfoot is a brown felt carpet, to give the impression of mud.
Drapes hang around all about, making the place shadowy but for the exit back
west.
163872: The doorway is west.
163888: The white wall is solid.
163904: And suddenly the illusions are real. You are on soft turf, under a
swirling canopy of a tent, and across the table from you is a woman both
beauteous and shadowy, her silken cowl shading her features. She smiles a wide
smile like sparkling stars and whispers quietly: "Greeting, friend." Her voice
is ash on the wind, it is a pattern in the ripples of a river of snow. It is in
your mind. Her fingers pass through the air, and the air ripples behind
them.

"You will fail too," she says finally, sadly.
164244: The teller is cackling madly, and whirring.
164276: A low round table, attached to the back of which is the half-mannequin
of the fortune teller.
164340: Under the table is the box-base of the mannequin.
164380: The fingers are delicately carved, the fingernails painted red, and cut
along the lifeline of the palm is a thick slot. The hand lies palm upward on
the table, with a tail of the robot's cloak pinned to it as though an arm lay
underneath - but it sags a little too much to maintain the illusion.
164576: You try to shake the hand of the robot; but it's just wood fixed to the
table.
164664: It falls to the floor beneath the table.
164692: She must not have an inbuilt mass-spectrometer then, to tell the
lockpick is silver.
164752: You hear a heavy clunk, the robot woman's jaw clangs twice heavily, and
the recorded voice says: "Pick a card... pick a card." Gears whirr and the
cloth 'arm' slides across to reveal three cards on the round table.
164904: Sitting at a low round table is a crude mannequin of a fortune teller.
164952: The robot woman is frozen in place, leaning sharply backwards, as
though she had just been struck in the face. Her lower jaw hangs emptily. Her
painted eyes stare up at the ceiling. She'd fall over, if she weren't secured
to the huge box which forms her lower body.
165132: She is only half there; below the level of the table she is just a box,
and above she is made of blocks of wood with thick string for hair. Her eyes
and face are painted, her lower jaw is a flapping loop of metal.
165276: She is dead still.
165378: Little motors slide the torso back and forth, woozily.

One side of its
cloak is pinned to the table, as though an arm lay underneath, and a carved
wooden hand sticks out the end.
165504: "Pick a card!" shrieks the loudspeaker.
165536: The mannequin's head rolls back and forth, nodding at the cards on the
table.
165588: "Choose one, choose wise!" drones the recorded voice.
165628: "Take a card, pick a card, take a card, pick a card..."
165676: The fortune teller robot rocks back and forth sharply.
165712: "Tell your fortune! Tell your fortune!" squawks the robot from a
speaker in the wall.
165772: Clack clack! goes the jaw of the robot.
165800: The mannequin's jaw flaps emptily.
165824: "Read your palm! Read your palm!" comes a recorded voice.
165868: The woman's painted eyes stare glazedly at you.
165900: "Spy your future! Spy your future!" rattles a loudspeaker.
165944: "Cross my palm with silver! Cross my palm with silver!" she shrieks.
165996: "Trying too hard! Trying too hard!" cackles the robot's empty voice.
166048: It'd be incredibly heavy, don't you think?
166080: It's moving so sharply you'd risk breaking your hand.
166120: It's just a painted block of wood!
166148: The robot cannot hear you; it just judders backwards and forwards on
its base.
166204: The button is a round and depressable, about the width of your
fingertip.
166252: It is currently sticking out a little from her back.
166292: You push the button into her back.
166316: The teller stirs to life, waving and flapping around, and jerks sharply
away from your finger. At this she falls dead, and you soon see why - the
button has come out of its depression again. It seems it is not catching.
166464: Again, the teller begins to move, for as long as you have your
fingertip holding the button into her back. But she's moving so sharply you
can't keep it in place, and when it slips out, and the button pops up, she
falls dead once more.
166620: You can't get the bung out any more, it's stuck.
166656: That wouldn't fit the socket of the button.
166688: . The teller stirs to life briefly, but the button does not catch, and
so she dies once more when you release it.
166762: You push the button, and wedge it into place with the bung.

The teller
jerks to life, mouth flapping, torso rocking sharply back and forth.
166856: A large three foot cube, presumably containing the gears and motors
which run the mannequin squatting atop it. On one side is a flap with a small
handle.
166960: No need to vandalise her further.
166984: A large battery, about a foot cube, with two metal contacts at the top
which extend and could be wrapped around a wire.
167064: You'd need to connect it to something.
167092: The gun itself is out of reach, but the wire running to it would be
easily connectable.
167152: You couldn't usefully connect it there.
167208: You'd need the battery on the floor to connect it really; it's quite
fiddly.
167264: You disconnect the crocodiles clips from the bared wire first.
167308: You attach the battery into place.
167332: The mannequin makes no reaction.
167356: There is a quiet hum from the east.
167380: The door clunks heavily, mechanically.
167408: A small red light illuminates on the needle-gun set above the
doorframe.
167460: A small red light illuminates on the needle-gun set above the
doorframe.
167544: The mannequin seems unaffected. Its problem must be mechanical, not
electric.
167600: The door clunks heavily, mechanically.
167628: The light on the needle-gun goes out.
167656: The light on the needle-gun goes out.
167714: Currently the contacts are secured to the top of the box, into the
mannequin's inner workings.
167780: The contacts are attached to the small terminal.
167814: The contacts are secured to the wires of the door.
167850: The contacts are attached to the crocodile clips of the grey wires.
167904: Three cards - left, centre and right - all with uniform black backs.
167952: "One at a time!" shrieks the parody of a voice through the speaker.
168000: All the cards are the same - face down, uniform black backs.
168044: The card is, of course, stuck to the table-top.
168076: The card is firmly stuck to the table-top.
168104: "Just choose, just choose," barks the speaker suddenly, making you
jump.
168156: "No no no no," rings out the robot's recorded voice, with the clanging
of the jaw like a spoon on a saucepan.
168232: Suddenly the Christmas tree is moving, whirring down into the room to
stop above a low dais. It is wrapped in fairy-light, like a ball-dress on a
debutante. They are not lit, but somehow you know they are so very, very
bright, if only they would work...
168404: Passages lead west and northeast, and the glass doors are south.
168448: You're on the ground already.
168496: Still too far.
168544: The lantern-light casts a sickly glow around the passages in leading
away, west, northeast. The glass doors reflect its light as though algae grew
there, as though you were behind the porthole on a long-sunken vessel. Which is
more or less how you feel about this case.
168720: Thin planes of light escape from between the slats of the crate.
168764: Your eyes are granted few details in the gloom. Dark-mouth passages
lead northeast and west. The glass doors shine a tiny shimmer. All is powder,
all is night.
168872: The foyer of the museum is a expansive space, completely empty of
billboards, or posters, or people. A long reception desk runs by one wall - it
is barren, not even a computer screen or a cash-till on its surface. It ends
just by the steps going up to the northeast, heading for the sculptures
169068: light can almost reach in the gloom. Another passage goes west. To the
south are the glass doors of the museum, and you can see the night outside
through them.
169172: There is a large hole in the centre of the ceiling. Below on the floor
is a black button.
169232: The tree whirrs back upwards through the hole in the ceiling.
169272: Click.

With a whirr, a Christmas tree, suspended upside-down on a
cable, descends from the ceiling.
169344: You probably don't want to do that. Get your torch first; it'll be dark
upstairs.
169404: , and the tree whirrs back up into the ceiling. Once through, you leap
down into the new room. You're a little nervous - after all, how exactly are
you going to get down?
169588: The panel is open, from inside spills out the wiring of the keypad.
169632: Set into the wall by the glass doors is a metal panel. It is right
where the keypad would be on the other side. Some sort of mechanism, perhaps?
169728: Don't go attacking the wiring. At least, not without some more
precision.
169780: You give the panel a firm whack, which hammers it even-more-tightly
shut.
169832: Now that you've sprung it open the latch is broken it seems, as it
refuses to do anything but hang open.
169904: The panel is stiff, and firmly rammed closed. There are gaps, you could
perhaps lever it.
169964: The lockpick is too flimsy to pry open the panel with.
170000: The key is the right width, but it's too small; you can't get a decent
leverage behind it. You need something longer.
170084: The chopstick is too wide to fit in the gap.
170112: You'd need something thin, and sharp, to lever it open with. And maybe
you should find it soon? You've not got so much time to just loiter here, after
all.
170220: You slip in the edge of the gnomon, and flick! the panel flies open.
170268: The panel is already stuffed with wiring.
170296: From inside, a tangle of wiring spills out like a split pig.

These
wires emanate from holes drilled in the bricks at the back of the recess behind
the panel - presumably there they link into the keypad - and disappear into the
side of the door. However, the wires have been skinned in the middle
170516: . Nearby dangle the crocodile clips from the end of a grey cable
170620: The wire with the crocodile clips runs from the panel through the wall,
and emerges by the small needle-gun set into the top of the doorframe.
170712: After some scouring you find where the grey cable reappears as it runs
through the wall - it emerges just by the doorframe. You follow it around,
eventually finding it plugged into the back of a small, needle-like device,
which points down to the centre of the doors, as though welcoming visitors.
170912: The bared wires run from the back of the panel - where presumably they
feed into the keypad outside - and then away towards the door. They are
presumably connected to the locking mechanism.
171036: They form the hub of a network of wiring - the battery contacts are
attached here, as are the crocodile clips of the grey wires.
171120: Connected to the bared section are two crocodile clips, on long grey
wires that feed into the wall.
171188: The battery's contacts are extended and wrapped around the bared
section of wire.
171244: The wires are not connected to anything.
171272: You touch the wire -- and pull back sharply from the shock! The battery
must be quite powerful!
171340: There is little slack on the wires, certainly not enough to pull them
out with.
171392: You'll have to be specific - the bared wires are connected to the
battery and the crocodile clips.
171460: The bared wires are not connected to anything right now.
171500: The wire with the crocodile clips runs from the panel through the wall,
and emerges by the small needle-gun set into the top of the doorframe.
171592: The clips are attached to the bared wire inside the access panel.
171636: The clips are currently attached to the battery contacts; as a result
of which, the needle-gun is active, with a small red light glowing at one end.
171736: There is little slack on the wire.
171760: The wires run through the walls, so you couldn't take them with you.
171804: The light on the needle-gun goes out.
171832: The clips are not connected to anything right now.
171868: The clips are already connected to the bared wire.
171902: You clip the crocodile grips to the bared wires.
171940: A small red light illuminates on the needle-gun set above the
doorframe.
171992: Connecting the clips together doesn't do anything.
172028: The reception desk is bare. There are no chairs behind it. It is really
just a great slab of furniture, more ritual than functional.
172116: The desk is moulded into the wall.
172140: There's nothing of note under there, though you have a good scout
around.
172188: Nothing - perhaps the mechanism is warming up once more.
172228: A thin red light scans across the desk, and when it encounters the
card, it is swallowed by a small hatch.
172300: There follows a low groaning honk.
172324: Then, with a cheery ping! something is placed on the desk. It's
172412: The cable of the tree runs away through the hole, but its easily large
enough to take the tree up with it too.
172484: The hole is wide - a metre and a half, maybe - and dark. Something
hovers there, just out of view.
172552: The hole in the ceiling is way out of reach.
172580: The hole is almost within your grasp - but not quite. The tree ends
just too low down.
172640: Half-way from the ceiling to the floor hangs a Christmas tree,
suspended upside from a long cable which snakes away through the hole above
your head. Its tip points to a button on the floor.
172768: The tree is quite large, and fills the space from the ceiling to about
halfway to the floor as though it grew there. But it doesn't, and it spins
ever-so-slowly one way then the other on the thick black cable which suspends
it from a hole in the ceiling.
172936: The smell of the pine is terrific.
172960: You're already clinging on as best you can!
172992: You put down the plank. Then, shoving
173042: scramble up the branches of the tree. Fir flies, in your mouth and
eyes, but you eventually establish a decent grip.
173120: You're far too busy just clinging on!
173148: The tree is about three or four feet off to one side.
173184: The tree is about two feet out of your reach.
173216: The wood is quite frail under your fingers, but doesn't snap.
173260: There's no good way to hang that on the tree.
173292: A small cylinder, the size of a lipstick, with a needle protruding from
one end. It is pointed toward the centre of the door like a sniper rifle
trained on the only entrance. There is some kind of vial section at the back of
it, in which purple liquid is visible. A single pearl of this hangs on the very
end of the needle currently loaded into place.
173524: Set above the door frame is a small, loaded needle-gun.
173562: A small red light glows near the front like an eye.
173600: You can't smell the liquid from here.
173628: You miss - the target is small, and firmly set into the doorframe,
after all.
173680: Even if you shifted the crate closer, it'd still be out of reach - it's
quite a high doorframe.
173748: You wander around the stones in that direction, but find nothing of
note.
173800: There is a hole in the ceiling, above the trough - but it's both tiny,
and far away.
173856: The rocks are back around you, only there are less of them, and they
are no longer body parts but rather flowing rivers and
worn-down-weathered-walls. The camera is also resurrected; its beady eye
spinning back and forth in a hoop of stone around the room. The trough by your
feet has grown into colour in fragments and shards. This room is one of bright,
wide red light, that you find both fascinating and soporific. You stare a
while.
174196: The floor is level here - level but cluttered.
174264: This room is a flat wasteland of little rocks and scree. The debris
stops toward the west, where the hallway continues, and through the doorway
south.
174364: This room is the eastern end of a long hallway, and although further up
it spreads out a bit, here it is just a dense field of rocks. Angular and
jagged, smooth and wind-worn, there must be every kind of stone here, and each
one touches every other, shoulders it and demands more space. Paths snake in
and out and around; your torch light dripping down avenues both left and right
like water along the cracks in paving.
174644: There is a freshness in the air, from the north.
174676: You try a path through the stones... but it leads nowhere, just a
dead-end, and you turn back.
174744: You try a different route, and though it seems to be going the right
way, then it winds round and ends in a big rock dead-end, shaped like a cupped
hand. No luck.
174856: Then you find a way - and head off purposefully. You catch a movement
in the corner of your eye, the red light of the security camera swivels round
and a shutter pummels to earth blocking off the hallway west, but two feet from
your nose. You step back, your way blocked, and the shutter rises up once more.
175056: West - camera - shutter - retreat. Just as before.
175096: You step northwards, tentative. But you know there's a wall there,
there's no point in trying, and you stop.
175168: You stumble further northwards, each step crunching the ground.
Eventually you emerge into light, and look about you.
175248: You touch a finger tip to the ground beneath. It is cold, and hard.
175296: The stones are rough, jagged, piecemeal and smooth.
175404: A thin red light shines from one corner, where a security camera
watches the room with an impassive eye.
175476: The camera is set halfway up the wall, and a little red light indicates
it - unlike everything else in this place - is on. It scans the room, twisting
back and forth slowly, the line of light sweeping over the stone statues.
175624: You lob the block of vacuum-sealed coffee, and it strikes the camera
firmly! But of course, it doesn't damage it, only bounces sharply away. To
break that thing, you'd probably need a shard of solid metal, or stone, fired
from a cannon; or a least a decent sling.
175808: just won't fly well enough or hard enough to do any damage. You'll need
a serious projectile fired at high speed to break that thing. Of all the
evenings to need your gun -- of course, it's at home with the wife.
175954: Your failed projectile falls back down to earth.
175992: They are strangely smooth and deformed. Perhaps they are carved, and
not just weather-blown. The more you look, the more patterns grow from their
bulk. There: a head, a face. And there: arms, entwined around a body - legs
bent at the knee. Figures kneeling. Figures pirouetting (and hung on a wire,
you suspect). It is like a gallery by Henry Moore and Dr. Crippen.
176240: These hulking great masses? Not likely.
176268: Most you could clamber on, but behind each of those is something sheer.
If you were a mountain-climber this would all be no trouble, similarly if you
were a demolitions expert. But you're neither.
176400: In the centre of the room is a wide sculpture like a trough.
176444: The trough is too small for you to stand in comfortably.
176480: A small can of petrol - not much use for anyone, really. It might hold
enough for a skilled arsonist, but not for a motorist in trouble. The nozzle is
thin.
176588: The ice lump is too large to come out of the nozzle of the petrol can.
176636: The neck of the crocus is too thin to let you scoop up with the nozzle
of the can. A cup would be fine; this is not.
176716: That wouldn't fit in the can's nozzle.
176744: You'd have trouble getting it out.
176772: You pick it out of the trough, wondering how it got there.
176812: The two chopsticks fit together perfectly at the top - like most
disposable chopsticks, they were joined at the top and have been ripped apart.
By the splinters - quite recently too.
176960: It's covered pretty firmly by the broken oven.
176992: It's covered pretty firmly by the broken oven.
177024: That might not be wise, until you know where it leads.
177064: You don't want to lose your lockpick.
177092: You probably don't want to lose it.
177168: About an inch-deep layer of stones which covers the entire floor of the
room.
177220: You find more stones, and nothing else.
177248: You collect up one of the larger stones.
177276: They are all pebbles, scree, no good for anything bar lining fish
tanks.
177324: Sitting on the plank is a stone, thrown here by your explosion.
177368: A large rectangular stone, roughly cubic, and indented a little on
either side. It's rather like half a brick.
177444: A set of eleven, metal stairs, with a metal banister rail. Otherwise,
it's a single moulded tunnel, like an escalator down to the Underground, only
not very underground. At the top, to the south, is a small door. You can make
out little of the room to the north.
177620: The stairs are now stonework, the banister old and rotting wood. Carved
upon the steps is a legend: "We shall become one, for the greater good."
Ridiculous.
177728: Eleven metal stairs.
177744: It's a little lower than you'd want it.
177772: And suddenly, you are in a different world. "Stay calm, Slick," you
think. "Suddenly this is a case for the Gurner family jaw."
177864: Archways lead out in three cardinal directions, and the north is taken
up by a impromptu workbench and chemical lab. In the floorspace in between, and
in the corners, are bell-jars. There are at least eighteen of them, filled with
a syrupy green liquid and each containing small figures. Some might be only
embryonic, others are clearly babies. None are moving. All is dead still. You
shiver. What the hell is this place?
178144: A stone room, built into the very foundations, with archways leading
east and west and steps away to the south. Perhaps it was once a wine cellar,
but since then it's been heavily done over.

One wall is a bank of machinery,
with gadgets and trinkets for mixing and shaking chemicals. This is next to a
workbench full of flasks, which runs above something that looks like a fridge.
By the other wall, and in the corners, and filling the floor, is a rack of
bell-jars. And these keep your eye, because they are filled with small bodies.
178508: And there is nothing here now but stone - stone walls, stone floor,
stony silence but for the ripple of water from the southeast. A table in the
corner is set with papers and a candle, nothing more. Upon the table is written
a message in flowing handwriting
178764: But you peer and lose interest, and the lines of the stone blocks start
to reform into outlines once more.
178836: Archways lead east, west, and south up some stairs.
178872: Mixers. Fridge. Test-tube-racks. Flasks, burners, pipettes. The list
goes on - and you're an ex-cop, a private eye, and not a scientist; you've no
idea what it's for. You can only hope it's keeping people alive.
179024: Some of it is broken - not much though. Most of it is untidy, unclean,
hardly that of a precise man. Nothing is active; the burners are off, the
mixers are still, the fridge is not humming - and its light is off. It seems
whoever used this place has packed up and gone.
179238: One vat sits off to one side, clear and filled with a liquid of a deep
purple colour. Premangled Possum, maybe, not that your school chemistry was any
good.
179352: There is little room on the bench for more.
179380: The vat seems very full of a deep coloured liquid. There is a tap at
the front, like it were just a home-brew kit.
179456: A large vat of purple liquid sits on the workbench.
179492: The vat is not open, and doesn't seem to have a lid either.
179532: The tap turns, a little purple liquid trickles over the floor. Rather
than waste it all, you turn it off once more. If you need to fill anything,
you'll be able to get more.
179648: Purple liquid sloshes around inside.
179676: The jars are each a couple of feet high, filled with liquid, and
plugged by a rubber tube at the top. Etched onto the glass near the bottom is
"FreekaPlastics" - must be a manufacturers stamp. Further, they have numbers
marked on in thick black pen - 81 through 98. 83 is empty. Inside each is a
twisted figure.
179892: These jars are large, probably heavy, and very much tied up in
machinery.
179940: The bell-jars are numbered, 81 through 98.
179972: Funny. There is no jar number 90.
180024: . Marked beneath the number is a pair of symbols:
180108: The figure in the jar is much like the others.
180136: Destroy these horrible things? It's tempting - but then, you don't know
what would happen if you did. You hand hovers, but stays.
180228: You peer closely at the figures, recoiling in horrible fascination.
None of them seem quite right - one has no nose, and the left eye is shrivelled
up. One has its legs fused together. One is too long and too thin, one is
almost a ball. And all have the same face.
180408: Maybe they could hear you if shouted, but... it's not likely.
180452: This is nothing but a thin ledge by the now-frozen river - the metal
walls of the lab just stop. No doubt this stream was handy, for disposing of
dangerous chemicals - and disposing of bodies. But it has become firm under the
low stone ceiling. Over on the other side, to the southeast, you can see a
boiler room.
180660: The river stretches away, under the low roof of the tunnel. But there's
no point going that way - you know where it goes, and you can get there much
more easily on foot.
180772: A dazzling sunlight strikes you from above! The roof has gone, instead,
you are stood at the base of a dizzying tower, around the rim of which large
trees grow, latched into the walls to form a tangle of trunk on stone. Vines
hang down from in centre, drifting back and forth on currents of air. You watch
a monkey, flitting its way from one to another. You watch butterflies, birds,
twitter around the leaves. And right at the very top is a large dome, which
slowly moves and shifts as though alive.
181104: By the side of the river is an open crate, stacked with foil bricks of
vacuum-sealed coffee.
181168: The crate must contain around three hundred coffee-bricks, all stacked
neatly together.
181228: They are very firm indeed, these foil bricks.
181260: The crate is quite firm (held so by the foil bricks).
181296: You've got a coffee brick already.
181324: You pick up one of the coffee bricks. It's solid, even though it's only
cased in foil.
181384: The crate isn't very high, or likely very stable.
181420: The river is a little wider here, frozen solid under a low arching
tunnel which runs roughly north-south.
181492: Gummed to the surface is a path of sawdust.
181524: Across the river is laid a plank.
181548: This part of the river is too wide to jump, especially with the ceiling
so low. You try - you fail - you slide, and crawl back to the land once more
181648: Whoops! You collapse right into a heap, not getting anywhere across the
ice.
181700: The river lies back to the northwest.
181724: This is a small dark hovel in one corner of the museum, seemingly
inaccessible except across the wide river to the northwest; and that would be
impassable if it weren't frozen solid. Still, no-one would want to come here.
It's noisy and hot, filled by a large boiler and a chimney flue which stretches
upward to the night outside. And there is nothing else here.

There is a
persistent soft slithering noise.
182000: The flue is too high to climb.
182020: The boiler has gone, the floor space is empty, and above you feel a
cool draft through a gap in the ceiling. You are in an air-raid shelter, a
solid wooden door behind you and the river flowing fast outside, beyond a
tangle of tree roots. The sound of squawking monkeys comes to you, along with
heat. It seems that paradise is just outside... but you are not.
182272: The slithering sound seems to come from behind the boiler.
182312: The room smells like rotting laundry.
182340: A large, squat, gas-powered water boiler. It has a large wheel at the
front to operate the door on the bottom of the flue, for cleaning.
182432: You slam the door shut, and spin the wheel closed.
182468: You turn the wheel, and there is a blast of heat as the flue-door
opens.
182516: Behind the boiler is a run-off pipe, leaking a stream of water over the
stones.
182572: The flue stretches up and out of sight. There is a little hatch at the
base.
182624: The brick seems to shudder as it heats, until with a horrible force it
explodes, smearing coffee powder all over the inside of the flue. Tendrils of
brown smoke wisp up on the thermals to the vent way above. The smell is
terrific.
182776: A run-off pipe, only a finger width off the ground, presumably for
excess water in the boiler. The thing is clearly set up wrong, too, because
there's a steady trickle coming from here.
182900: The water is lukewarm and tastes like sucking a shirt-collar.
182944: Water trickles out, that's about it.
182972: And this room is walled by old sandstone, well-worn blocks dating back
several hundred years. There is no lighting beyond your
183060: , as everywhere, and the cracks in the mortar are long and deep. It
seems to have served as living quarters. It is spartan - nothing beyond an
angle-poise lamp, protruding from the south wall - a glass insect tank in one
corner, and a pallet of old wooden slats with no mattress by one wall.

Lying
on the bed is
183268: an old man. He is sleeping, he is very still.
183300: The walls remain the same, perhaps there colour lightens a shade like
that of the sun with every minute past dawn. And the sun glints brightly, too,
a gleam that dazzles your eyes so you look away first and then look back - it
is a gleam of silver, coming from a bright blade, buried deep into the stones
of the wall. It is heavy, ponderous, and magic.
183532: The door from the room is east.
183552: Hinged so as to bend and reach across the room. It is off.
183592: You swivel the angle-poise around for a while.
183636: He seems to have died recently, maybe a couple of days ago. His eyes
are closed, his hands arranged neatly on his chest. He is not covered by a
blanket.
183752: An old man, with raven-like features and a heavy-set brow. His hair his
white, his eyebrows thick, his eyes closed and he is not moving. Two things hit
you, all at once. Firstly: the old man is dead. Secondly: you've seen the old
man before. It's Edgar Mulldoon.
183936: He's already wearing shoes - well, sandals.
183968: This corpse will have to wait for the morticians - you left your
cadaver-sheet at home, keeping dust off the television.
184048: Leave him be. You're not here for him anyway.
184084: Look. He's dead. What don't you understand?
184116: Call yourself a detective. You fail to have detected something pretty
fundamental here.
184312: Good grief. Give up.
184444: It's good to see you have a mature attitude to death.
184484: A note lies near the bed.
184516: "To whoever should find me:

"The last one nearly worked - he looked
right, and he lasted longer than those before him. But still, he died, I think
somewhere above the foyer. I still overtook him. I have others nearer
completion -- but my time is over, and my experiments have failed. My bloodline
dies with me now; there is no cure.

"Let them know I was Edgar Mulldoon. I
leave this place - my legacy - to my grandson's wife, as my will states. It
should be split between each of them."
184856: Well, then. Looks like the one you want is just above the foyer, then.
184904: The key is marked "MASTER" in carved letters along its length.
184988: Oh, they're small and spread out and sharp. Leave them.
185032: Thick shards of broken glass.
185056: The floor is thick with teeth of broken glass.
185088: Oh, they're small and spread out and sharp. Leave them.
185126: You scan your torch around this room. It is a shop - the shelves are
full of trinkets marked with four coloured squares like the mosaic outside. It
is large too: you wander through and explore, avoiding the tables and glass
cases which fill the floor space.

The doors at the front are tightly shut. To
one side of them is a line of bookcases, so you head off that way, exploring
the space available. If the doors are closed now, the doors may have been
closed when Mr. Mulldoon was here two weeks ago. If so, he would continued on
this way.

Between the bookshelves you find a photocopier, and on the floor
nearby are fifteen copies of a hand, pressed on the glass. In one wall is a low
door. You open it and duck through.
185608: You seem to have reached a limbo room of sorts, through some low
cunning.
185660: There's no way down back west, you know that.
185692: Only this is no generator room -- You are lying on your back on hard
stone, rounded like cobbles. Light, firelight plays over the black-painted wood
ceiling. Shrouded figures bend over you. You hear in the distance a resonant
singing, like whalesong. You -
185866: A tight crawl-hole, reached by a small door from the west, back to the
burying bookshelves outside. But here is what you have been looking for, for
lying at your feet, by a large generator machine - it is Mr. Mulldoon. He is
face-down, one hand around the throw-switch of the machine; and he is
dead.

The mouth of a chute gapes to the south.
186100: His face matches the photograph you were shown earlier this evening. He
looks vaguely like an expressive turkey, or a seagull that's flown into a
window. He's dead, though a cause is not clear.
186232: Sticking from the back of his neck is a short, inch-long needle.
186280: You slip his shoes back on his feet.
186306: You would not steal from him - and give the pendant back. Well; that's
your work here finished.
186376: Don't go lugging his body around. That's not your job; that's for the
police and the ambulance men, when they arrive.
186460: You really want to take it back? What, as a souvenir? You're sick.
186510: His pockets are nothing but nick-nacks - there's nothing there that you
could take of any meaning. What are you going to do? Lug the whole corpse home?
And then you spot a tinkle of reflected torch light, and reach around his neck
to produce a large glass pendant. It sparkles tiny rainbows as you spin it,
gather it up, and slip it into your pocket.
186748: Sticking from the back of his neck is a short, inch-long needle.
186792: He's holding nothing interesting.
186816: The pendant consists of a circular sheet of faceted glass set into a
copper ring, only an inch or so across; all slung on a plain string. It
glitters and shimmers with beauty.

This is the pendant that his wife said he
always wore - so often he usually forgot it was there. Well, he won't miss it
now, of course.
187028: As the string touches your neck nerves run electric down your spine.
187076: You slip the pendant around Mr. Mulldoon's neck. It suits him - but it
does not make a difference to his eyes.
187156: You'd best not lose it - this is your proof.
187188: The surface tingles a little, as though charged with static.
187228: Everything looks kaleidoscopic, broken up, fragmented and twisted into
a myriad of hexagonal pieces which rearrange themselves constantly. And the
mists inside spell "
187376: It heads away south.
187392: You hear a sharp crack! from below.
187420: Wait - you came here to find Mr. Mulldoon; and you have. But you ought
to take something with you, to give to his wife. Something to show for your
trouble.
187528: You slide down the chute into a well of darkness below. With a thump
you land onto the floor.
187592: You slide down the chute - into the sculpture room below - and come
flying off the celery stick!
187660: A large generator, filling most of this small room. It has a funnel up
top, near a fuel gauge which sulks on empty. At one side is an enormous coil of
wire. In the centre is large throw-switch, like Dr. Frankenstein might employ.
The machine is quiet, and still. The power is clearly off.
187856: The machine's switch does nothing - because there is no fuel in the
machine. Its petrol was presumably all in that can, which you blew up.
187948: That wouldn't do the machine any good.
187976: You slide out the needle from his neck.
188004: An inch long, like a long pine-needle, only made of metal. It is finely
hollow inside, and there hangs, even now, a drip of purple around its inside.
This is a needle from the gun in the doorway downstairs. Perhaps it means he
was murdered - it is hard to tell.
188180: You should be careful with it; it could be dangerous.
188220: Not a room any more, but a torrent of broken slabs and rocks and
enormous stones the size of cars. They pile down like a fallen rack of dominoes
from a tunnel mouth to the north, right through the room to spill out
southwards. Whatever force cast them here is still dying - you feel its heat,
and some of the smaller stones are even glowing with a throbbing red hum. There
is no way past, or through, only back, westwards.
188500: You try to pick a path through but they are like a forest, or a
cliff-side.
188552: Something large has been destroyed, and thrown these pieces like
matchsticks into a heap that could be cairn to a Titan. Perhaps it was an
aftershock of the explosion you caused.
188672: There are gaps of air, but nothing could survive the fall - not a
statue, and not a man.
188732: You hunt a moment, and then find one stone, with the remains of what
might be a carving - a boat, and a man. But it is hard to say for sure.
188828: The room looks just as before; and the celery sculpture looks no less
deranged. In fact, it is better lit.
188904: This is the western end of a long hallway, and where the rubble of your
explosion stops, strange sculptures start. But these sculptures aren't stone -
they're blocks of plastic, bits of cloth, squares of foil. The most striking is
the large celery stick reaching up to the ceiling.
189092: Behind this is a door, leading to shadowy steps to the north.
189136: A few stairs lead down to the southwest, out of this particular
exhibit.
189186: You do a double-take. Yes - a doorway has opened up, behind the celery!
189240: You land sharply, and the torch flies out of your hand, hitting the far
wall with a crunch, and rolling to a halt by one wall.
189328: There's no way to go that you can see.
189356: The shadows of the celery sculpture - but you can see nothing.
189400: You don't want to risk climbing anything in the dark.
189436: You walk down three stairs to the southwest.
189468: Most are ugly. All are cumbersome.
189494: A large, half-cylinder sculpture like a children's slide or a giant
stick of celery. It starts here by your knees, and disappears up through the
roof. Quite what it's supposed to symbolise is beyond you.

The chute is
clearly not too stable; it's held upright by a complex scaffold-frame which
slots between it and the south wall. This bears the weight, so that the mouth
of the chute is a few feet off the ground, pointed directly at the south wall.
189800: You hump the cannonball onto the celery. It rolls just a fraction,
falls off the end, and thuds to the floor.
189872: You scramble a little way up - then slide right back down again.
189916: A solid ceramic mug - very tasteful - with "GILES IS BOSS" painted on
it.
189976: A low doorway, painted the same colour as the wall.
190010: And you are no longer in a dead-end.

This is a corridor, east-west
from Foyer to an exhibit housing large bulky machinery - not exciting, they
resemble photocopiers. But to the north is something of greater interest - a
door hangs open, and beyond it is a dusty passage of old stone. The ground
there is thin sand. And within swirls a bright circle of red light, like a
boxer's eye or a Stop sign. It spins, and crackles, and seems to be alive...
190316: The light from the crate reflects dimly on the white walls, and the
dark cupboard to the north. The foyer back west is a pool of black.
190404: Just a dead-end; there is nothing here bar a closed heat-vent high out
of reach. Otherwise - three blank white walls and the foyer back east. You're
stood inside a milk-carton, tipped onto its side.
190544: A dead-end, leading to the east, with a high heat vent in the south
wall. Well: dead except for the cupboard that's set into the north wall.
190640: Still - just a dead-end. The walls are solid. You run a hand over each,
for secret doors, triggers, anything to explain where that robot came from. But
there's nothing. Nothing at all. Just the foyer to the east and inexplicability
underfoot.
190804: You find a passage leading eastwards!
190832: Nothing - you find nothing at all.
190856: You try to find something. But there's nothing there now, nothing.
190904: The only way is east.
190920: The slats are closed. Good thing too - it's freezing out there!
190964: You can't prise them open, the mechanism is too strong.
191004: A small walk-in closet, containing nothing bar a small terminal off to
one side, and a strange set of catches and straps on the wall. The passage lies
off to the south.
191116: There is nowhere else to go.
191136: The straps hang from the wall in place to secure Giles' head, arms and
unicycle stick. A catch below grabs the spokes of the wheel on either side. He
is
191240: present at present, and appears to be "off".
191300: "Please don't do that," Giles intones suddenly, giving you such a shock
you leap away.
191360: "No, really, please don't," he repeats. You desist.
191400: The straps secure on easy buckles. You play with them a while.
191444: They're firmly fixed into the wall.
191602: IN".
191608: "It's closing time now. They Stay Way Are."
191644: "Doors not opening now. Not right."
191672: "Come now, I'm not a mindless robot," he chides you.
191712: "Waiting for my coffee," he mumbles.
191740: "Follow follow follow," Giles exclaims.
191840: What you tell me I think not!
191864: You suppose I no no no no!
191884: Such things are not!
191900: I move for no MAN!
191948: Giles is strapped into the wall, unmoving.
191976: Dangling from a belt, you now notice a small black tablet.
192068: . His face is therefore buried into the floor, his jaw stuck mid-flap.
192116: He looks quite strange in this tight stone tunnel, with his carnival
painting and puppet-show mechanics. But not so unreal as not to get in your
way.
192216: Giles looks quite sedate, rolling here and there, his arms spread like
a swooping bird.
192276: Giles has shock-white hair, a wide mouth, a hooked nose, and a label on
his old tweed jacket that reads: "Old Giles". He stands very straight, his arms
out either side as if his joints were too stiff at the elbows. The torso is
tubular, the head swivels freely from side to side and the lower jaw, a hinged
piece of wood, bangs up and down like a heartbeat. His voice comes from a
speaker set in his neck.

Below the waist he has no legs; but rather one single
bicycle wheel, with two small stabilising wheels on struts protruding from the
axle. This is attached to his body by a straight metal pole. He is constantly
moving, the wheel constantly turning to keep himself upright, his arms are out
for balance. He stares glassily at you through painted eyes.
192784: There is the bat-call squeak of Giles' wheel as it turns.
192824: Giles is humming quietly to himself.
192852: Giles is chattering almost incessantly.
192880: Giles is flat out on the ground, tapping his fingers in annoyance.
192926: Giles is strapped into the wall, unmoving.
192958: Giles lumbers around the tunnel is a slow procession.
192998: Giles zips in figure-eight around the tight stone tunnel. "You shall
not pass," he intones. "This place is no longer open to you."
193092: A wafting umbrage before the doors is Giles, wheeling back and forth on
a squeaking wheel.
193156: Giles runs back and forth in front of the closed, locked museum doors.
"It's closing time, now. Closing time. We're closed..." he chatters in a
stream, his jaw flapping every time he turns a half-circle.
193300: Old Giles is balanced against one wall, looking at the old man.
193346: Giles rolls calmly around the room.
193374: Old Giles is here, zooming around on his unicycle wheel.
193418: From out of the passage behind comes a clattering noise. You wheel
round, and are almost bowled over by a white-haired figure who races out, arms
wide, heading straight for you! He loops you twice on a unicycle wheel,
exclaiming: "WELCOME TO THE MULLDOON MUSEUM" at the top of his voice. You catch
a glimpse of a name-tag on his third run around the room. It reads "Old Giles".
193704: Giles winds back and forth across the floor, quite leisurely.
193748: Old Giles meanders around the corridor.
193776: "I'd far rather it if you didn't pass," he comments soberly.
193824: Giles fills the corridor the way a good basketball player fills a
court.
193872: There appears to be no way past him.
193896: Giles rockets back and forth, side to side, everywhere. You need to
take him down.
193956: The spokes of Giles' wheel whirr past in a blur.
193990: Giles lies flat out of the ground in front of the doors, and is not
happy about this.
194056: Giles zooms back and forth in front of the doors.
194092: Giles marches by the door like a soldier.
194120: Old Giles patrols the glass doors without flinching.
194160: "Would you pick me up please," Giles whines, face-down on the floor.
194212: A grinding from Giles' wheel indicates he is trying to force his way
through, but the stick is holding and he is just burying his face further in.
194312: "Really, I'd appreciate it if you would," Giles adds.
194352: "Just come over here and give me a hand, please please please," the
robot says from the floor.
194420: "NOW! NOW NOW NOW!" Giles screams.
194456: Giles is tapping his fingers impatiently on the ground.
194494: Giles rolls off to the foyer.
194518: Giles bounces improbably up the steps to the celery room.
194560: Old Giles rolls right up to the celery sculpture, and disappears behind
it!
194614: Giles bounces down the steps, hopping on his wheel.
194652: Giles veers between the bell-jars, his arms up like a ballerina, and
goes west.
194708: Giles rockets into the room, shouting about coffee.
194744: You hear the robot chattering somewhere to the west.
194780: "Do you want coffee, Granddaddy?" the robot whispers to the old man.
194830: "Granddaddy? Are you sure you don't?" Old Giles pleads.
194876: The robot whizzes twice around the room and chants: "So you're not sure
you don't? Well, I'll get you coffee then."
194958: Giles wheels toward the north wall. But there is more to it than that,
as a door swings open, revealing a cupboard space beyond. He slips inside, and
fumbles around with something.
195082: Old Giles rolls off westwards.
195112: Giles hovers at the edge of the scree-rock to the east.
195152: "Need coffee can't go need coffee cannot go," Giles mutters, as he
patrols the eastern edge of the room.
195228: "WHERE IS COFFEE. I don't know," Giles mumbles.
195276: Old Giles is clearly peturbed that he cannot continue eastwards.
195322: Old Giles rolls away into the Foyer.
195352: By extending and retracting his pole, Giles bounces up the stairs.
195400: Giles veers between the bell-jars and heads for the stairs.
195442: Giles strolls off to the east.
195466: Giles rockets into the room, shouting about coffee.
195504: Giles rumbles quietly into the room.
195530: "I'm not following you out there!" squawks Giles irritably.
195580: Giles tries to follow, but the debris fouls up his wheel and he quickly
spins back round.
195640: "DO YOU WANT A CONVERSATION?" Giles screams at you from the Sculpture
Room, but he does not follow.
195724: The robot cannot follow you through the debris, and so spins away out
of sight to the Foyer.
195788: Giles whirrs after you, his arms outstretched.
195820: Old Giles rockets past you into the room.
195848: Giles almost mows you down as he follows you.
195878: "So, laddie, what are you doing here this evening then?" the robot
asks, almost conversationally.
195948: "Well, laddie. I bet you're wondering what this museum is for," Old
Giles rabbits through his speaker.
196024: "WELL I WANT COFFEE NOW," Giles barks.
196068: "Would you like a cup of coffee?"
196092: "You want me to get you coffee, yes, that's right?"
196132: "So you're not sure, no, you don't, no, want me to get coffee, that's
right?"
196192: Old Giles zooms around the room on his unicycle wheel, arms out like a
puppet.
196248: Old Giles zips an inch from your nose, flapping his jaw.
196288: Old Giles spins three times on the spot, looks like he's about to fall
over, then careers off toward a wall.
196364: He's far too heavy - and fast - to lift.
196396: You pick Giles up. "Thank-you boy, Thank-you," he says icily. You do
not remove the stick, however, and when you let go, he drops straight back down
onto the floor with a grunt.
196520: . In a second, Giles pushes up with his arms, the wheel whizzes round,
and he zips backwards and upright, flips round and stares straight at you. "
196672: You do that once more...
196724: It's too wide to fit between the spokes.
196808: You slip your stick between the spokes at the bottom of the wheel.
Giles zooms onward, the stick whips round, and slams up against the metal pole.
The wheel catches, Giles keeps going, his body hammers downward and his head
hits the floor with a smack.

"Ha ha," intones his voice, muffled by the
ground.
197012: That wouldn't fit between the spokes.
197040: "Come now, none of that," Giles says calmly, as he slips out of the
way.
197092: into Giles, and he wobbles on his stabilisers, zips his wheel round
faster so the spokes are a solid blur, but stays upright. "NOW THEN NOW THEN,"
he intones at you harshly. "NONE OF THAT."
197266: You wouldn't kick a man when he's down. But Giles is clearly not a
man.

His head skids a little across the floor, and he whines.
197360: You give Giles a sudden push, and he waves his arms frantically, trying
not to overbalance. But his stabilisers - though each one is only the size of a
two-pence coin - keep him upright, and he rolls away from you on his wheel.
197516: He can probably still hear you. Well, maybe.
197548: He's very very very awake already.
197576: You clip the tablet back onto Giles. "Thank you very much," he drones.
197628: "Please just give that back, sir," he snaps.
197664: He looks bored. "That has no effect on me. I'm not real."
197708: "You aren't going to bribe me, oh no!" he exclaims furiously.
197756: "COFFEE!" he exclaims, quite distracted from his guard-duty, and
snatches it away, furiously 'drinking' it. Then, little by little he slows
down, until he looks at you remarking: "You know, I really ought to not let you
past. Coffee or no."
197928: "Don't think you can bribe me no no time to go time to close."
197972: "I'd better ask Edgar if he wants some wants some wants some first
yes?"
198024: He's not looking at you right now.
198048: "I'M ASKING EDGAR FIRST YOU NINNY!" he screams.
198100: "Coffee!" exclaims Giles happily.
198128: He spins once around on his wheel in merriment. "I wanted coffee that's
what I wanted yes I did oh thankyou!" He even manages a full bounce on his
wheel. He flips a catch on his arm, a section of his back flops open, and he
places
198288: inside. His eyes spin once.

Then he says, much slower: "That's so much
better, thankyou."
198352: "IT'S BIT DRY ISN'T IT???" he wails.
198392: "That's not coffee that's a building material!" he complains.
198440: "You just want me to eat it?" he sulks. "No fun."
198480: "But there's no COFFEE there!" he wails.
198516: "The code is for the reader of course. I couldn't tell you it though,
you might cheat."
198576: "Ooh, win a prize! You need three - do you see - three three three.
That's three! Hee-hee!" he exclaims, in a sing-song fashion.
198672: "What would I want with that?" he screeches.
198708: "Why would I want that? Do I look like I want that?"
198752: "Now, now, it wouldn't be real," intones the voice from his neck
speaker.
198804: "I'm not talking till you help me up," he grumbles.
198844: "I can't hear you from down here," he snarls, a touch sarcastic.
198892: "You'd better give me a hand first," he mutters.
198928: "Poor old Edgar passed away, I think. It was very quiet, it was while
he slept. He's down in his Lab, that's where he loved to be after all. So sad."
199036: "I look after the exhibits in this place. It's all very dear to me."
199084: "I'm a great fan of people," Giles remarks. "I'm interested by them.
199136: "He's a great fan of Modern Art. I think it made a nice change for him
- after all, he has to put up with seventeenth century portrait-style more than
most!"
199248: "I look after the doors, yes. I keep a very strict schedule, you know!"
199300: "That's one of my favourite exhibits. It's not working at the moment -
we're having trouble with the power thanks to a meddling guest recently. I like
to have the controls to hand, though."
199432: "I'm very pleased you chose to visit our museum. You seem an
interesting man."
199488: "I find coffee very relaxing. It is one of my real pleasures in life."
199540: He looks a little embarrassed. "I don't think Edgar wanted those to be
noticed, but," he shrugs. "You're more perceptive than our last visitor, it
seems."
199652: "The last one believed in magic. So Magic he was given!"
199692: "That's my door control. Please don't play with it."
199732: "They are my collection. We're very proud of them. Edgar has been
working hard on those."
199796: "I'm very proud of my museum. We are building up a fine collection."
199848: "Edgar loved his lab, and worked there all the time on his projects."
199896: "This way is not open to you. Not like this. You may only enter like
the others."
199952: "I've always thought of it as symbolising a limb of some sort," he
remarks distantly.
200016: "A lovely room, wonderful smell."
200044: "The code is for the reader of course. I couldn't tell you it though,
you might cheat."
200104: "We shall not talk. You shall not pass."
200136: "Please, my friend. I'm trying to rest."
200168: "Edgar is a nothing, just like you."
200196: "I DON'T KNOW," shrieks the robot. "I've not seen Edgar for a while now
but I'm sure if you went to look for him you'd find him upstairs in the
Botanical Room that's in the northeast corner of this place and I'm sure he's
around you really ought to look though he'll be back shortly -" and on that the
robot swivels to face you, pauses, and the lower jaw flips round to reveal a
picture of a smiling mouth. Then he whizzes away again.
200652: "I'm a curator here, just like your Grandfather. I lock up - I open
doors - and I lock them. It's important!"
200732: "I get to close them when we close you see."
200764: "Isn't it pretty? PRETTY PRETTY PRETTY."
200808: "YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU," the robot exclaims helpfully.
200856: "I have an awful time getting that open don't you think?"
200900: "Ooh, win a prize! You need three - do you see - three three three.
That's three! Hee-hee!" he exclaims, in a sing-song fashion.
200996: "GOING GOING GOING COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE," Giles reports.
201060: "Do you like coffee I like coffee."
201088: "People are like me and they are Mine to like!" Giles chitters.
201136: "That's a very important part of Edgar's work," he says, shortly.
201188: "The flies eat foil. Crazy things crazy crazy."
201224: "People are interesting, aren't they, don't you think?" he replies,
strangely.
201280: "FAR AWAY BUT WORTH THE TRIP," he exclaims. "BIT LIKE THE HIGHLANDS."
201360: "What goes up must come down! Hee-hee!"
201392: "What's a building without people?" he asks. "But you're not welcome
now."
201448: "We're closed now," he replies flatly.
201480: "This is a museum of Magic. My Grandfather makes magic, and people.
Magic people!"
201540: The first board is way in the air.
201564: The first board is just beyond your easy reach.
201596: The first board of the scaffold is way up.
201624: It's too high to get a grip on, though you might be able to put things
there. And of course you could climb the bars to the roost.
201712: You can't really do that from ground-level.
201744: The scaffolding is a mesh of pipes behind the celery sculpture, cupping
its curve in a coordinate grid. There are two main levels to it
201868: , each set with a single board. The lowest is within climbing distance.
201916: The celery stick is supported from behind by some complex scaffolding.
201964: It's somewhat absolutely enormous.
201992: You balance the plank back on the scaffold.
202024: The first board of the scaffold is now way out of reach.
202064: You can't really see it from down here.
202092: The first level has no board, and the second is way too high to reach.
202138: You scramble up the pipes and pull yourself onto the first board.
202184: The scaffold is pretty sturdy, it seems.
202212: The metal all seems fairly sturdy.
202236: You stand on a plank of wood, with one above, and a short drop to the
floor. The celery stick cuts through the lefthand side of the pipe-work as it
slides its way down.
202348: Not with that cannonball you don't.
202376: Not with that cannonball you don't.
202404: Up or down?
202416: Sturdy enough, you hope.
202436: Perhaps messing with it whilst stood on it is a bad idea.
202476: And have it come crashing down on your head? That's not a good idea.
202524: A large, half-cylinder sculpture like a children's slide or a giant
stick of celery. It starts here by your knees, and disappears up through the
roof. Quite what it's supposed to symbolise is beyond you.
202664: You hump the cannonball onto the celery. It rolls as soon as you
release it, accelerating downward
202732: , clearing a path as it goes. Then it
202912: and smashes into the south wall!

To your delight, the wall buckles,
falling inwards in a great cloud of plaster-dust. When it clears - and you
finish coughing - there is a ragged hole, through which the General's smiling
face is visible.
203074: You slide back down to the ground.
203104: Now things are a little hairy. The floor is quite far away, and your
light only picks out a little of the monkey-frame you've scrambled up to get
here. The celery stick runs right through the middle of the plank on which you
stand.
203256: You clamber onto the lower board.
203280: Are you crazy?!? It's about twelve feet down!
203316: Not with that cannonball you don't.
203344: You are more or less at the top of the scaffold now.
203380: There is little space to roam here.
203404: A six-foot plank of wood. It looks a little old, and a little warped.
203454: A few feet below is the plank of the first level.
203492: It's not serving as a floor right now.
203520: Don't be crazy! You're standing on it!
203552: You reach for the plank - it wobbles - and then crashes to the floor
below!
203604: The objects resting on top quickly follow.
203636: It's not anywhere exciting to be.
203660: The car park of that mad-house. Yours is the only car - now there's a
surprise.
203716: The car park remains exactly the same - except your car disappears, and
you are left standing, somewhat impatient, by empty tarmac. A pause and a
pause, in which you notice a white glow from outside the museum's entrance.
203862: Enough of these games then. You step out of the car, and walk back up
to the museum one more time.
203958: You hop into your car. You throw yourself into the seat, slam the door,
fasten your belt.
204020: A rather nice black Honda. It's an automatic, and they're pretty rare
in Britain.
204080: Your car is open, and ready for you to get away.
204116: The door is not locked.
204132: Your car will start without that; it's a good machine.
204172: You're hardly in the mood to mess around.
204200: There is no steering wheel. On the dashboard are three buttons, green,
orange and red; labelled: "Drive", "Park", "Reverse".
204292: You are in a wide field - there are three trees about you, and beneath
each tree is a cube of resin. There is a right choice, you think. But such
things are not always the case. The tress spin about you and you sense a great
smell in your nostrils. Not sweet, not perfumed, but acid.
204480: You are strapped down by a seat-belt. It holds fast your arms and your
legs.
204532: Enough of these games then. You step out of the car, and walk back up
to the museum one more time.
204604: A voice whispers in your mind. "Choose..."
204636: The voice comes again. "Choose one."
204676: "It is not difficult. Choose."
204700: The voice comes again, demanding that you choose.
204732: A rather nice black Honda. It's an automatic, and they're pretty rare
in Britain.
204792: Let's assume you know how doors work.
204818: Three buttons: Drive, Park, Reverse. That's it. Nothing more; just
smooth plastic.

These weren't here before, you know that.
204912: Your finger hovers a moment. How can you be sure what's the right thing
to do? If this is just a trick of that place?
204996: "You have chosen well," returns the voice, and from then the windscreen
shatters, the tarmac turns to grass, and things become very strange indeed.
205116: . And you are left, staring outward at the sky. It is filled with
coiled black clouds, curved and bent. They seem to make shapes. They seem to
say: E8. You stare at the green world around, and eventually breathe your last.
205264: "I did not make you right," the voice responds sadly. "Perhaps my next
will fare better." With that a green fog descends all around, and it is
strangely interminable. You fall asleep.
205392: None of it seems real. You are staring at the dashboard.
205436: And perhaps the museum is now lowering its guard, for you are somewhere
else entirely. A low stone tunnel, not made of bricks but carved out of solid
rock. A seam of blue copper sulphate runs on one hand like a bolt of lightning.
Light floods in from behind you, from the south, where outside there is
sunshine - but it is too bright to see more. Your path is clear; into the
building, northward, into this god-forsaken flytrap.
205724: The tunnel heads north.
205740: Giles tries to block you, but he's moving in such a leisurely fashion
he doesn't really manage it. You step easily past.
205824: Giles bowls into you as you try, and you are forced back. "NO PASS," it
screeches from its little neck speaker. His spokes whirr away, glinting in the
sunlight.
205936: You hear a soft whispering echoing from the north.
205972: No going back, surely.
205988: A thick, short stick lies here.
206012: A branch of pine wood, as wide as your index finger, as long as elbow
to thumb.
206068: This is no wand. Nor is this time for magic.
206100: Here the stone cavern branches into a fork, with paths both northeast
and northwest. Two ways - three, if you count the passage behind you, back
south. Each are dark, unmarked, there is nothing to tell one from the other.
How are you supposed to know the way to go? How are you supposed to choose?
206296: A large celery sculpture protrudes from ceiling, beside the north wall.
You know this room well, and watch in fascination as the stone walls flicker in
and out of view.
206416: You hear nothing past your own breathing.
206444: There is no breeze, the air is still and dank.
206476: You can tell nothing of the passage, beyond the dark.
206512: The roof of the tunnel is within reach, but solid.
206548: There is no tunnel in that direction. There is only northeast,
northwest or south.
206602: You head that way for a few steps, and feel the air getting colder. In
the distance is a vivid green light. And unperturbed, you step further, one
foot after the other. It is not before the light surrounds you and you hear the
stone whisper that you realise you have made the wrong choice.

So you lie on
your back, staring at the clouds, watching the skies slowly darken. Idly you
wonder how long you will wait.
206872: You wait, as though hoping for inspiration. None comes, it seems.
206920: By the east wall is a boil of rounded rock, forming a small plateau a
foot from the ground.
206984: The east wall bulges out a little, or in; as though curling under your
feet. It forms a low table, or a doorstep, the stone smooth and not too wet.
207084: You lean back against the stone wall, but it is strangely soft, and
parts under your weight. Looking closer, you see the the wall behind your rock
is covered in thick moss.
207200: The stone is smooth, and quite dry.
207224: You sit upon the stone, which is not uncomfortable.
207316: The moss is damp to the touch, and grows in a thick patch like a
curtain.
207364: The moss is very soft under your fingers.
207392: You have peeled away all the moss from the tunnel mouth.
207432: You peel away the moss, but most is not attached to the stone. Why?
Because there is no stone behind. The rock by the east wall is a doorstep, to a
low tunnel which leads away into darkness.
207560: The tunnel was once covered by moss, and its mouth is stained a pale
green. It leads away eastwards into the dark.
207636: You cannot see far, into the dark.
207660: A wide stone chamber, deep underground. It is lit from luminescent
vines wrapped all around the walls, woven in and out like thread, and the light
hangs down soft-green over the figures. And there are many - standing frozen in
a circle around the rim of the room - some seated - some fallen - all still,
unmoving, and staring straight ahead toward
207916: the centre. And there lies a pyramid.
207944: "What is a building without people?" whispers the pyramid.
207988: "What is a museum without art?"
208012: "What is a mission without purpose?"
208040: "What is a collection without collection?"
208072: "Who am I?"
208084: You slide past the moss, and crawl down a short tunnel, until finally
emerging into a grand space. There is light here, and a moment passes before
your eyes adjust once more.
208200: There is no way to leave from here.
208228: The figures around whisper quietly.
208252: You hear voices, whining to each other and echoing under the roof.
208296: You hear one heavy breath, and it is not your own.
208330: They are all dressed differently - some in tunics like the waxworks
from the museum, but not all. One wears a long trenchcoat, one the habit of a
monk. No doubt they all saw it different - just as you saw it as a murder and a
madman; maybe for them it was the tangled streets of Wartime Vienna, or a
monastery in time of strife.

Two of the men you recognise - Mr. Mulldoon,
stood erect but staring, impassive
208636: . The other is Edgar Mulldoon, far older than his grandson but no less
alive, and no less dead.
208700: You have difficulty trying to give Mr. Mulldoon his shoes, as he will
not lift his leg. Eventually, you give up.
208780: You have been there. You do not wish to be there again.
208820: They do not seem to notice as you shake them.
208852: They do not seem to want it, though they follow it with their eyes.
208896: The vines are thick, sloshy, and filled with a shifting green light
which plays over the entire room.
209044: . Its base is a little buried in the dust, as if it had been here for a
long time.
209100: The pyramid is tetrahedral, a point above a triangle.
209136: The eyes of the figure flitter back and forth as you wave the pyramid.
209184: You raise up your arm - the eyes follow. Then you hurl down the
pyramid, a meteor smashing to earth.
209252: You stab him clean because you know he is not there.
209288: It hits and splinters, cracking from base to tip into pieces which
pirouette away, spiralling out like streamers. The sound echoes around the
domed rock.

And they blink - blink again - and one moves.
209422: You lift the pyramid - it is surprisingly light. The eyes of the
figures follow silently. Beneath the pyramid is revealed a cross, cut into the
stone below.
209528: You are stood upon a hillcrest, the grass leaning in a light wind.
Shade is cast down by the hulk of standing stones, their ring around the centre
slab, upon which lies the man. He has a face that is familiar, and he stares
toward you emptily. You raise the flint-knife way above your head, and call out
for them to hear. It is as though the stones are watching, the grass is
waiting, and the sun is just about to rise at your command. A little syrup
light catches on the blade. Your arm begins to drop.
209864: In the centre of the floor is a cruciform slot. In each of the four
quadrants it marks out there is a painted a coloured dot.
209948: You place - or replace - the shoes on top of the cross slot.
210028: Through the hole is dark down there, and cold. Around the rim is
painted four coloured dots - the same colours as the museum's mosaic.
210120: It's too thin for you to hide in.
210144: It is just a hole in smooth stone.
210168: The tank is a habitat of twigs and leaves, scattered about with
twinkling shards of silver foil and a few pebbles. A moulded plastic pond sits
at the base. The air inside the tank is thick with flies, which flurry and wash
in a swarm like swirled coffee back and forth beneath the valve set into the
top.

On the front of the case is a plaque.
210392: You top up the pool in the tank a little.
210420: You grit the base of the tank a little.
210448: Your pour in the thick potion. Perhaps the flies are moving more
dizzyily? It's impossible to tell.
210516: The powder falls into the pool at the bottom, which immediately freezes
solid!

After a long pause it melts, revealing a clump of eggs whose colour has
darkened to a hazy brown. In a sudden fit of splurge, they all hatch, releasing
a huge swathe of flies into the tank.
210696: That'd never fit through the valve.
210724: You feed the empty foil through the valve, and it falls into the tank.
There is a sudden maddy flurry from the swarm of insects inside, and as though
torn by a smoke hand the metal is ripped, threaded and destroyed! Shards of
paper-metal fall like rain.
210892: You'd only lose it; you could never get it out again.
210932: Though the flies would probably have loved the food.
210968: Inside the tank are scraps of foil, that were perhaps once whole but
have been shredded somehow.
211036: The glass is sealed all round, to prevent the insects escaping. The
only way in is the valve at the top, which is already open.
211120: Probably not a good idea to release the swarm.
211156: The flies buzz and swirl inside the glass tank.
211188: The glass tank is black with flies.
211212: The flies, as one, bang into the glass with a shudder.
211248: The insect tank makes a grating hum.
211272: In the valve you notice some tiny eggs. You take one.
211312: A tiny egg, the size of your thumbnail, its shell made of glutinous
gel.
211360: That probably wouldn't be good for it.
211388: As you hold the egg by the ice, it seems to change colour
ever-so-slightly. But you're going to need to have it a bit colder, and
probably longer, to do anything major.
211504: You could crush it dead so easily - that you're inclined not to.
211548: The little egg has changed colour now it's thawed out. You watch,
slightly worried, as it pulsates a little, growing darker, and ever so slightly
larger. Then it appears to fall still - only to explode in a small capsulet of
phlegm! From this shower, a tiny fly emerges.
211732: It is dragged almost instantly upwards on a thermal, and disappears
from sight.
211788: From above you hear a sharp 'boom'. Poor fly - if he was caught in
that, he probably didn't make it.
211860: You listen for any sound of vacuum-seals breaking - but there is none.
He must have missed the bag, probably because he was wooshing upwards so fast.
211962: The fly buzzes around briefly, as though looking for something, but
eventually he gives up and disappears, pulled away upward on a thermal.
212112: "SIFTER FLIES: Live near rivers, sifting for the particular metallic
elements upon which this rare breed feeds. Life cycle is usually short, longer
in captivity. Eggs are laid in late autumn in water, and tend to hatch just
after the first thaws.
212284: A brick of vacuum-sealed powder, in thin silver foil wrapping. It's
coffee.
212340: You've had too much coffee now, and feel ill.
212372: The sparker flares, leaving a black streak on the foil, but nothing
more.
212420: The foil brick isn't open. Though you can feel the coffee inside.
212464: The foil is too tight to tear, because of the sheer pressure of coffee
behind it. What you really need is something to just puncture it slightly.
212620: The chopstick is Chinese, and so the tip is blunt.
212656: The brick depressurizes with a "boff!"
212684: The foil refuses to puncture, due to the pressure of coffee behind it.
But then your instrument is crude.
212752: A soft foil bag of coffee powder.
212776: The foil bag is already full of coffee powder.
212808: The bag's full of coffee right now.
212832: A scrap of foil doesn't make for a good container.
212904: Painted solid white.
212920: By the south wall is a dispenser machine. Next to it is a bin.
212964: A large dispenser, labelled "Play the Mulldoon Challenge!". Its main
body is a sheet of glass, behind which are three stacks of scratch-cards, and
beneath each stack at the base of the machine is a button. The cards are
basically identical - red, painted with a swirling vortex around which are
placed four scratch-away foil panels. A caption reads "Get THREE to
travel!".

Each card has a number in the lower corner - the current cards are
from left to right:
213284: Through the glass are the cards, from left to right:
213320: The top of the dispenser is sealed.
213344: There are three buttons, left, middle and right.
213376: It's time to kick that gambling habit.
213432: onto the ground, which you pick up. The next card in the rack slips
down into view.
213488: The buttons run left to right, each below a row of cards. The current
cards are numbered
213548: It's a bin for used - and unlucky - scratchcards. It has a thin slot on
top.
213604: You slide it in. There is a Foosh! and a tiny line of smoke arises from
the slot.
213660: It's not really wide enough to stand on.
213692: With such a thin slot you can't see inside.
213744: The scratchcard instructions read: "Claim your winnings at the front
desk for a great prize!" You've scratched away the panels here, they show
213840: The scratchcard pictures a swirling red vortex of light, with four
scratch-away foil panels on it. "Get THREE to travel!" it reads in large
letters. Instructions on the back read: "Scratch away the panels. Get three
symbols to win. Claim your winnings at the front desk for a great prize!". In
the bottom corner of the card is its serial number:
214080: There is a flurry of excitement from the insects, who are upon it
before it even reaches the bottom. After a few mad seconds they calm down a
little, revealing a worse-for-wear scratchcard: the paper is bent and creased,
the colour is peeling. All the foil panels have been eaten away too,
uncovering:
214280: The card falls into the tank, and is set upon by the insects. Behind
the panels is revealed:
214340: The insects perform quick work, revealing the sequence on the card was:
214388: You guess that was a winning card. Shame it's now behind solid glass.
214440: The card slowly sinks to into the muck and morass at the bottom of the
tank and is lost.
214500: You hold the card up to the light, but can see nothing through the
foil.
214548: This card has been scratched already.
214576: You scrape at the card with your fingernail, but the foil is too thin
and smooth.
214664: You tear the card into a hundred thousand little pieces!
214720: A small, unmarked silver coin.
214744: Blank.
214752: Also blank.
214764: A thick lantern, of dirty oiled steel. It is burning away with a
green-tinged flame, which makes you wonder if it is oil burning inside, or
something else, but the glass is too smoky to see through.
214900: Light dances around the wall like reflections from the sea.
214940: The General's eyes swivel to the lantern in your hand, the pupils
shrinking to points. "I see you've found your way, my boy," he says quietly.
"Remember what I've told you. I forgot." And then he falls still.
215088: A small black plastic tablet, about an inch square and a finger width
deep. It's rather a like an infra-red key-ring for a car, even more so thanks
to the little red lens at one end, and the button in the centre.
215232: "Please don't steal that," Giles says calmly. "That's my control." You
do so anyway.
215300: The cavern is now dark, the skylight just a sore score of red against
the smooth dark of the stone. The air is warmer than it was, darker, and
stuffier. In a shallow way it occurs you might be trapped down, here, buried
under whatever has fallen above - perhaps the tunnel, leading away southward,
will not set you free.
215512: You stand in a stone-hewn cavern, the moist walls shining in light from
a cruiciform skylight, high above. It is cold here, very cold; the ground
underfoot is thick with ice-crystals, many inches deep. The cavern descends
into darkness to the south - back to the sculpture room, no doubt emerging in
some secluded part of the gallery you had not spotted before. It ends not far
to the north.
215772: You are still underground, in a damp passageway. At one end is a buried
room - it is a graveyard, somehow you know that. In the other direction it
leads away into darkness. The world has spun here, though, and north is no
longer north. You suppose. It is hard to tell, under the ground.
215964: The cave does not continue much further. It probably hits the side of
an Underground tunnel, or a sewer, or something.
216044: The cave leads away southward.
216064: There is a sharp tang of sulphur in the air.
216092: There is a searing sound, getting louder.
216120: You hear the gentle tap-tap of chisel on stone.
216156: You hear a quiet mumur, nothing more.
216184: You follow the tunnel southwards a good few metres, your light playing
from wall to wall, looking for some way out. You do not find anything - indeed,
when you shine your torch ahead it seems the cavern continues forever. You must
have become lost somewhere, missed something - so you turn on your heel and
step back into the light from above.
216412: You turn on your heel. At the sound of crunching ice the carver turns,
suddenly. He balks in alarm, throws his chisel away and bolts down the tunnel
to the south, rushing right past you!
216536: You follow the tunnel southwards a good few metres, the reflection of
daylight on snow providing thin guide to your eyes, but enough to make out the
shadowy walls in the dark. You go a good way, following the footprints of the
man, but there is no change. The tunnel goes on for as far as you can see. You
turn back, back to the pool of light, thinking that you must have missed a
turning somewhere back.
216800: A cold wind whips down the tunnel with a low moan.
216836: A chill breeze springs from the air to eddy around you and be gone.
216882: Icy breaths weave between the tunnel walls.
216916: The ice is a thick layer of frozen snow - a million tiny balls of it,
each just touching and sealed by frost together. Every step you take sinks low,
destroying some tiny cathedral construction.
217048: The rock floor is there, somewhere, buried away from you now.
217088: The ice is loose crystals, all held together in a sheet with air gaps.
You cannot break it up.
217152: A long slot in the stone, with a shorter cross bar near its top, the
skylight does not reveal easily if it is carved or natural.
217240: It frames only heavy darkness, and the slow trickle of dust.
217284: Beyond it is the sun, shining very brightly casting a brilliant cross
upon the ice.
217340: The light outside is growing dimmer. Perhaps clouds are rolling in.
217388: A heady red glare comes through the cross-slot, as though an angry eye
bored down on you.
217448: The man taps away at the stone wall.
217474: The man shifts his stance to carve lower, and you move to see. At the
crunch of the snow beneath your feet he turns, suddenly. His gaze meets yours
for a moment, then another; then he flees, flinging away his chisel and racing
down the corridor.
217638: You hear a slight whine in the air.
217666: The cross of light over the carving gets dimmer. You feel a breath of
warmth amidst the stone.
217732: The sky is turning to black, and here it is getting hot. A sudden red
glare through the cross-slot picks out the carving in a highlight of blood.
217830: With a smash that undoes the world, the cross-slot falls black.
Something heavy has struck - you feel the push of air like a great hand, the
force of heat upon your breast - you fall backward into the softening snow. A
great spear of stone flies from the ceiling, from the skylight, smashing to
pieces against the carving in the wall, where the man was stood but moments
before.

Then all is still, and you pick yourself to your feet.
218114: Under the cross of light cast by the arrowslot, a strange man stands,
carving a picture in the cave wall.
218186: The carvings on the wall are shattered and torn.
218222: Lit by the cross of light is a carving in the cave wall.
218264: The carvings depict a boat, long and slightly curved, upon which stands
a man. Beneath is some animal. The rest is unclear.
218348: You chisel half-heartedly at the wall, to no great success.
218392: The etchings are not deep, and are damp like the stone.
218428: The image been obscured by the crater and rubble of the missile from
above. There is nothing left visible, but for four pinpricks like stars, in an
arc above the remaining noise.
218544: A cross of light falls from the arrowslit upon the grey snow.
218588: He is a man - or perhaps he is an ape. Hair covers his body, falling in
thick unkempt waves from his head, like a sea spilt with oil. His brow
protrudes forward, and is knotted in concentration, as he grips his chisel and
hammers at the wall.
218752: At the sound of your voice, the ape-man turns round. He stares into
your eyes a moment, before throwing running away, throwing his chisel away into
the ice as he goes.
218864: At the sound of your voice, the ape-man turns round. He stares into
your eyes a moment, before throwing running away, throwing his chisel away into
the ice as he goes.
218976: As you approach, the ape-man looks sharply up. He stares at you for a
long moment, before casting away his tool and bolting down the tunnel to the
south.
219080: As you approach, the ape-man looks sharply up. He stares at you for a
long moment, before casting away his tool and bolting down the tunnel to the
south.
219184: A stone chisel sticks from the snow.
219212: The chisel is as long as your cubit, tapering from a thin flat point to
a wide base. It is a good tool, if a little crudely carved from green-black
flint.
219316: It is not sharp, exactly; the blade is flat.
219348: Wide feet, unshoed, five toes. They are a stride apart.
219388: Your feet are far smaller than his.
219416: It's just a footprint, move absence than presence.
219452: The cloths and hardwoods of the General's office reflect your soft
green light in quiet shades. There is something of a pause in the air, as
though a lull between storms. The General himself is frozen still, standing
quite erect, his face haunted, in the large painting on the south wall. You can
wait here - and then the shutter leads eastwards, down a few steps and back to
the battle-fields.
219712: This room is dressed up as a General's office, maybe from Napoleonic
times, perhaps before. It is quite plush, coloured by muted reds and browns. A
bookcase stands by one wall, and velvet curtains hang over a mock window to the
north. Facing that is a large painting, dominating the room, at least eight
feet tall. The only incongruous element - aside from yourself - is the shutter,
leading eastwards down a few steps.
219996: A room painted up to be a room from the trenches, in one corner sits
the General himself. Or rather, a mannequin of the man. His jaw flaps and he
wobbles backwards and forwards on his pedestal, clutching his stomach. He seems
a jovial man indeed.
220188: The mock window only appears to open onto a field.
220224: "Wait a minute! You've got my book!" the General exclaims as you pass
his field of vision. "Put that back IMMEDIATELY!" You do so, sheepishly.
220340: Dirty rotten scoundrel, stealing my belongings! Now you've put it back,
may we can treat each other with some respect?
220424: Again? Tut. Shall we put it behind us? Will you do that? I do hope so!
220476: You're pushing me too far!
220496: MUTINY I SAY!
220524: "I hope that's not how you solved my problem! Disgraceful! Alternative
tactics, I don't approve!" He continues to rant as you leave.
220624: "I hope you've not been cheating! Well, in case you have!"
220668: "Wait! At least leave the curtains open!"
220722: The curtains are drawn together.
220746: The south wall contains a ragged hole.
220776: The window has been broken open in a ragged hole, through which you can
see some modern art.
220838: There is something thick, soft and cloying that way, but you fight
through it.
220894: You fight and fidget your way through the curtain.
220932: It's not a real window, you know.
220956: You can't see much, because the curtains are closed.
220992: Through the hole you can see the General.
221020: Either side of the window hang thick velvet curtains.
221056: Through the ragged hole in the centre window you see the end of the
celery sculpture. It's like looking down the barrel of a gun.
221140: The view itself is of pleasant rolling fields, and lush hillsides
stretching away. Smoke rises from behind most of these hummocks; you can only
assume that's where the war is being waged.
221268: You widen the hole a little, tearing at the plaster.
221400: "That's a pull door," the General remarks helpfully.
221442: "That's a pull door," says a voice behind you. You turn - but there is
no-one there but the painting.
221560: "I appreciate you trying," the General remarks. "I used to have such a
lovely view when that was open."
221636: You draw the heavy curtains across the window with a swish.
221678: "No, don't do that," the General complains. "
221716: "Much better!" the General beams.
221744: There is nothing of note behind the curtain.
221776: The curtains are securely pinned.
221798: You hide yourself in the curtain.
221824: "What are you doing?" ask the General calmly.
221860: You pick the book from the shelf without the General noticing.
221904: You reach for the book. "If you do that, you'll feel very guilty, you
know!" the General chides you.
221972: Before your hand touches it:

"That's my historical tome! You can see
it here in this picture, too, on my table. Very worthy." The voice comes from
the painting. You leap back in shock.
222104: "Dont you go stealing the books, or I'll never tell you how to win!"
exclaims the portrait sharply.
222172: Solid mahogany, its varnish a little scratched.
222220: Perhaps the most depressing book you've ever seen. It's an alphabetical
list of battles, listing dates and level of carnage. You could look one up; or
you could drink bleach.
222340: "How rude! Not to introduce yourself first!" exclaims a voice from
behind you, before you open the volume.
222412: "I see you're eager to learn. Here - I'll ask you a question," the
General says.
222472: "I hope you didn't just look it up," the General says sourly.
222516: The General's eyes, swivelling around the room, settle upon you and the
book. "NO CHEATING!" exclaims the General, forcefully. "If you just read it
from there - well, don't think I'll be helping you ONE BIT!"
222692: . "Battle of Coalhill, 1485, deathtoll - 1,200."
222736: . "Battle of Basingstoke, 1496, deathtoll - 3,000."
222804: The entries in the book aren't listed chronologically.
222840: Hastings - 1092.

How odd. Maybe this isn't one of those books which is
supposed to be educational.
222912: Agincourt - 1872.

Hmm. Not likely.
223084: The General's portrait is eight feet high, framed in gold-painted wood,
and directly faces the mock-window. He is depicted standing by a table, with
one hand resting upon its surface near a book and the other holding a rolled-up
scroll. He looks very serious. He has a long black moustache, a triangular hat,
and several medals.
223308: He is staring out of the window intently.
223340: His eyes are strange - and then you see why: they bulge out from the
surface of the painting!
223404: His eyes roll quietly in their sockets, like air-bubbles floating under
cling-film.
223462: "I'd appreciate it if you put my book back down," the General remarks.
You do so.
223524: "What are you doing with that book, you scoundrel!" exclaims the
General sharply. "Put it back!" You do so.
223604: "I hope you didn't just look that last one up!" His eyes flurry madly.
223656: "You cheat! Well, we can't have that!"
223686: The General waggles his eyes in a friendly greeting. "
223806: The eyes in the painting move slowly around the room. "Hello, there,
young sir. I am the General, nice to meet you," says a voice.
223900: "Well? Aren't you going to say hello?"
223932: "I said hello, boy."
223948: "Don't you have any common courtesy?"
223976: "Here, boy. I bet you'd like to know how to win, wouldn't you?"
224028: "Well? I'm a General! I know these things! I can tell you how to win!"
224084: "Would you like me to tell you how you win?" the General asks.
224128: "Listen boy, yes or no. Shall I tell you how you can succeed?"
224172: "You'll never do it without me! So - yes or no?"
224212: "Look. Let's start again, shall we? Maybe one of the other ones has
come back to you now."
224276: "Let's see, shall we?"
224296: "Let's try another, then."
224316: "Something easier, perhaps?"
224340: "You're not very good, are you? Here's a different one."
224516: But his heart isn't really in it, and as he waits, he turns to stare
out of the window, becoming transfixed.
224590: The General looks away to stare out of the window.
224632: The General's eyes roam listless around the room.
224668: The General hums quietly to himself.
224694: "I'm a great fan of art you know."
224724: "I asked to be hung facing this way."
224754: "Used to have a lovely view," the General complains.
224796: "It's very boring, you know, just hanging around here, with nothing to
look at."
224860: Come on then, boy!
224876: Well?
225020: The General's gaze is fixed ahead.
225044: The General stares through the broken window, at the art beyond.
225088: The General's eyes are on the celery sculpture just visible.
225132: The General looks straight ahead, away from you.
225168: Well, boy?
225176: Any thoughts on the question?
225196: Have you got an answer for me?
225292: There is no response from the painting.
225320: The General is not looking at you.
225344: "What a funny way to say hello!" he bawls.
225376: "Excellent! Now - a good general knows his history. Do you know your
history?"
225432: The General is not looking at you.
225456: "What a funny way to say hello!" he bawls.
225488: "Very well. Let me know if you change your mind!" His eyes fall still.
225538: "Don't know it? No, no, you don't seem to." But he does not give up.
225596: "Don't look so sour, lad. Chin up."
225624: The General is not looking at you.
225648: "Well, hello there sir!" exclaims a voice suddenly, which you realise
is coming from behind the painting. The eyes of the image swivel round to look
at you.
225752: "Yes, yes, boy. Hello! I can see you!"
225784: There is no response as you threaten him.
225812: "That's mutiny!" the painting barks suddenly.
225848: It's difficult to be affectionate to a painting.
225884: You want to carry around an eight-foot painting? What, do you think
you're in a Laurel and Hardy film?
225956: The painting is firmly flush with the wall and will not move.
225996: You leap away, realising the voice has come from the painting.
226040: There is no response from the general.
226066: You kiss the General's ring respectfully.
226100: "Very good," he replies irritably. "Do get up."
226138: "How very formal!" remarks the painting, making you jump.
226184: at the painting. "Hello there!" it exclaims back.
226220: The General's eyes, settle upon you and the book. "CHEATING! You've
been CHEATING! Why, you scoundrel! You vixen! You hussy! That's disgraceful!
PUT MY BOOK DOWN!!!" You do so.
226372: "I'm going to hope you didn't use that book earlier. For the sake of
your soul!"
226428: "Well, if you've been forced to cheat, we'll have to give you a
different problem."
226488: "That's my historical tome! You can see it here in this picture, too,
on my table. Very worthy."
226560: "I'm very grateful to you, for opening that up."
226596: "The window had such a wonderful view when it was open. I'm a great fan
of art, you see. Modern stuff especially. I'd stare for hours."
226692: "You should see the damage we did at Verdun we that."
226732: "It's good to see you putting it to the old use."
226768: "What's that? Oh, not very interesting."
226800: "Yes, yes, but do you want me to tell you?"
226832: "I don't understand," the General replies. "How's that an answer?"
226884: "I don't understand what you're saying," the General replies.
226930: "Correct! Congratulations, boy! It's good to see someone who knows his
onions. Now - here's how you win. Here's the secret.

"You're given three
options - you advance, you hold, you flee. Never choose one of the three. Don't
do it, boy! The fourth option, the one you don't see at first, that's what you
want. The fourth option. Maybe it's to cut a supply line. Maybe assassinate
their leader, like we did back in '
227220: . But whatever it is, you've got to find it, and take it."

He nods
sagely, and adds: "Here's an example." A white card flutters to the ground,
from the bottom rim of the frame.
227348: The General peers at the scratchcard. "No, that's wrong!" he announces.
"That's not it!"
227416: You bawl even louder.
227432: You cry out at the top of your voice, but it's still no good.
227476: "I can't hear you, boy. I see your mouth move, but no words. Speak up!"
227528: Maybe he's deaf.
227544: The voice comes from the painting. You leap a little in surprise.
227588: How exactly do you wake a painting?
227612: A playing card, blank white on both sides.
227644: "You chooooose you choose!" chimes the robot, hovering back and forth.
This seems to have got it excited, as its rocking becomes more violent, firing
back and forth until it is almost a blur. The jaw clacks manically, dragged
along by the movement. You step back a wary pace. She flies backward. She flies
forward - so hard she almost cracks her head on the table. She rears back --
and then all is still, quite suddenly.
227932: You lay the card down next to the others, in a neat row.
227972: Lumped in a corner is a large iron cannon-ball.
228008: Its surface is rusted and mottled, and many faceted like a soccer ball.
It is very, very heavy - it may not be perfectly round, but it is perfectly
solid.
228304: You drop the ball, and the plank shivers alarmingly at the impact.
228348: "Impressive bit of equipment, isn't it?" The voice comes from the
painting.
228408: No spring chicken, is it?
228428: Not exactly lightweight, eh?
228448: I had my men carting those back and forth all day!
228516: Bit strenuous for you, maybe?
228552: Your arms are hurting within seconds.
228580: Not with that cannonball in your hands you don't.
228616: You take this excuse to put down the cannonball. It
228680: You take this excuse to put down the cannonball.
228716: There's no way to go in that direction.
228744: Roll it on the slope? Probably not a good idea.
228780: There's stairs that way. No thanks.
228808: The ball won't roll, it gets lodged in the broken stones.
228848: The hole is too far off the ground to roll it through.
228884: You can roll the ball, hand over hand.
228912: It's far too heavy to throw anywhere.
228940: A small orange rubber bug, about the size of your second toe. It's made
of rubber, which is quite sticky from being slightly damp. It's the sort of
thing you've seen used to seal test-tubes.
