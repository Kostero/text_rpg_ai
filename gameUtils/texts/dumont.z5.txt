122860: You can only do that to something animate.
122892: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
122940: I didn't understand the way that finished.
122972: Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which exactly?

123676: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions

123880: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
123912: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
123944: Digging would achieve nothing here.
123972: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
124000: You would achieve nothing by this.
124024: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
124052: But there's no water here to carry.
124080: Real adventurers do not use such language.
124112: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
124140: There's not enough water to swim in.
124168: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
124196: That would be less than courteous.
124220: Is that the best you can think of?
124244: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
124284: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
124316: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
124372: It looks frighteningly like you!
124396: You push down from the ceiling but float back up.
124432: You flail your arms, swimming through the air, suspended above the
ground. Unfortunately, you make no progress.
124512: You can't see where you're going!
124572: It's tough to say since it isn't around.
124604: A serious question, to which you have no answer.
124640: You're probably human, but one can never tell these days.
124684: That's not a 'who', it's a 'what'!
124716: Hmmm... I'm not sure there's such a thing in the game.
124760: You got me. Try something else, like a direction.
124796: Well, that was fun. What next? Pogo sticks?
124832: And the cow jumped over the moon, too, but it didn't do her much good,
either.
124888: On top of smoke oldie, all covered with snow. I lost my poor mind...
er... well, you try and make up lyrics like this.
125020: I am the eggman, they are the eggmen, I am the walrus! Goo goo ga joob!
125072: Why do we never get an answer. When we're knocking at the door...
125152: but nothing special comes to mind. Not surprising, given your current
state.
125448: Hints have been disabled.
125466: HINTS disabled.
125666: "Yes, hello dere."
125752: You don't have to give it to him--just show it to him.
125792: "That's nice," he says.
125814: "Don't show that to me," he says, "Or I'll want one for myself!"
125868: "Very nice," he says.
125888: It might be best to not try that.
125912: You are on the Kite Race course. The grass is a deep blue-green,
beautifully groomed, tightly cropped as though it were a putting green on a
golf course.
126024: The kite banks left and right, then takes off out of sight.
126068: In a burst of speed the kite takes off to the north, then heads off to
the south.
126124: The kite performs a graceful banking turn and sweeps off to the east.
126172: In a frenzy of motion, the kite soars straight up and then down.
126218: Turned.
"Nicely done," the desk-voice intones inside your mind.
126272: Parti is so impressed with your key handiwork, he finally loses that
bored expression for a moment and waves your diploma. He presents it to you
with a twinkle in his eyes.
126392: It's not in a position to be turned.
126420: The key has already been turned and cannot be removed from its slot.

126760: You can't go in that direction.
126864: is giving one of his crash courses in physics and you swore this time
you'd get the stuff down cold.

As you approach the classroom the smell of
popcorn wafts through the door, and you find Dumont inside, showing a Marx
Brothers movie to an empty room.

"Oh! So we have a class! Welcome!" Dumont
says excitedly as he ushers you in. He looks at the film for a moment,
chuckles, then switches it off. "Since it's just the two of us, and it's a nice
day, why don't we walk over to the Research Zone? I'm working on an experiment
there," Dumont says, scratching his wild frizzy hair then reaching for his
coat. "We can consider it a lab class."

The Research Zone, shrouded in mystery
since the last big experiment blew the roof off the billion-dollar facility,
has been off limits to students. You are honored that Dr. Dumont is allowing
you, a lowly physics student, access to a privileged area.

After walking for
what feels like miles down the brightly lit twisty hallways of the Research
Zone, Dumont stops abruptly and opens a door. Fumbling for a light switch
inside, you hear him cursing under his breath, "Ah, here it is!" and the room
is washed in light.

Inside there are mounds of books, magazines, popcorn,
clustered around a massive wooden desk while across the room is a curtained
area. Dumont sees you eyeing the curtain. "Shall we see what's behind curtain
number three?" he asks you with a sly smile.

He pulls the curtain back briskly
and a chill runs up your spine. There, amidst a tangle of wires, computers and
a huge wall poster of the university's underground particle smashing cyclotron,
sits a gleaming, black, human-shaped shell the size of a sports car. The lid is
open.
129712: omewhere, but you know I'm afraid the metaphors will be too personal
for just anybody to make sense of them, too much of my own personality, my
likes and dislikes."

He shakes his head, "But who knows?!! They won't let me
try it out! I could be the first human to experience sub-atomic life, but do
they give me that honor? Nooooo!" Dumont gestures wildly as he talks. "They've
decided to train a subonaut, someone who will be groomed for the mission."

He
throws back his mane of wild hair and laughs. "Subonaut! Sheesh!" He paces
across the room then turns to you. "The experience will take only a few
moments, but it won't feel that way to the person inside the shell. Time will
be suspended and drawn out, rather dramatically I suspect."
130246: Dr. Dumont leans forward, peers at you as if to see whether you've
taken it all in, then steps over to the shell. He adjusts a wire inside the
shell.

"If I could just make a few adjustments, but the darn subonaut hasn't
been selected yet..."

He turns his piercing blue gaze on you, "Would you mind?
Getting in the shell I mean? Just for a moment? I only need the physical
dimensions of a body, yours will do fine," he says happily, gesturing to the
awaiting interior.

You look at the black acrylic shell, not so chilling as
when you first laid eyes on it. Dumont seems so intent on adjusting those wires
in the shell, you feel compelled to help him out. Maybe this will even boost
your grade, you speculate, as you slide into the contours of its inner
dimensions. Dumont reaches over you to bring down the biolink electrodes,
attaching the small wired disks to your temples, your arms, torso, and
legs.

"Now, where did I put that screwdriver?" Dumont ruminates, as he
disappears out of sight for a second.

The second draws out. You get fidgety.
You hear the deep thrumming of the particle accelerator, feel its vibrations
through the shell. Dumont doesn't seem to be returning. As you pull yourself up
for a peek, your hand hits something along the outer edge of the shell and you
hear an ominous click. The black shell quickly begins to close as you get a
glimpse of Dumont running across the room shouting, "Oh my Gosh! Stop! Wait!"
and then the shell lid clicks securely shut.

The last thing you hear is Dumont
shouting, "This isn't going to get you an A, you know!" before you black out.
131407: Good move.
131476: Hmmm... an interesting concept, but doomed to failure.
131516: You push down from the ceiling but float back up.
131552: You flail your arms, swimming through the air, suspended above the
ground. Unfortunately, you make no progress.
131632: You can't see where you're going!
131660: You can't see much of anything with these glasses on.
131700: "I'm you," you hear yourself say to yourself.
131736: You think about it and think about it.
131764: Come on. You mean you don't know who you are? At a time like this?
After what we've been through together?
131844: Wouldn't you like to hold onto them? I mean, they might just come in
handy.
131900: I've heard of dropping one's jaw...
131928: Chewing on a nail or two is one thing...
131960: As you turn your mind inward, you begin to get a headache.
132004: Hmmm... lifeline looks okay. Looks like you could use a manicure,
though.
132058: Try "ask <someone> about <something>".
132100: "Here you go, paisano," he says. You take
132136: It's a key for the desk in the School of Thought.
132172: Yep. It's a wall, all right.
132196: It looks like a black, shiny, brightly-polished floor.
132236: It looks like the pattern is vaguely familiar, one of overlapping
circles.
132288: You can't see anything down there. Not even your feet.
132328: You see nothing special about the floor.
132356: You see nothing special about the grass.
132384: It's up there. Or so it seems to be...
132416: You can't see anything up there through the swirling mist.
132460: It's a deep, beautiful blue, reminding you of a perfect day you once
spent at the beach.
132522: You swim through the mist, your feet touching the floor as if your were
walking in head-high water...
132598: You wave at the mist with your hands, trying to part it, but it's too
thick to see where you're going.
132674: Like pea-soup fog, the mist parts around you then fills in the place
where you just were.
132740: You're disoriented by the thick, moving mist. You take a few steps and
then stop.
132800: The mist is thick and cold on your face, making it difficult to see
where you're going.
132862: You take a step, stop, take another step, and find yourself disoriented
by the thick, swirling mist.
132936: The mist is so thick, you feel as if you're floating in it, your feet
not even touching the ground.
133008: You're in a bedroom. Everything about this room seems normal on one
level and yet oddly different on another. A quick scan around the room makes
you ill-at-ease, as if you don't belong here. Or perhaps the room itself
doesn't belong anywhere. A dresser complete with a mirror lies off to one side,
against a white, featureless wall. A door is off to the west while to the
south, through a doorway, you can see what must be a small bathroom.
133316: Well, to start with, it's not really there. To end with, it's not
really there.
133376: It's a frosted mirror. You see a hazy blur there, a featureless face,
much like you feel after a hard night of partying.
133464: And get seventy-eleventy years o' luck? All bad?
133500: You see a hazy blur there. Which isn't bad, considering how you feel.
133550: You hear the door shut and click behind you.
133584: It's a comfortable-looking but plain bed. The sheets are white, the
blanket is white, the pillows are white.
133664: Leave the bedding alone. It's not bothering anyone.
133704: Leave the nap to the carpet's nape.
133732: On closer examination, you realize the dresser drawers are fake, merely
painted on the front. A chill runs up your spine. You wonder how you could have
mistaken it for something real.
133860: Not bloody likely. Take a closer look.
133898: computer is doing the best it can to create a reality for you here. But
after all, you have only so many neurons, and overloading them would
necessitate a call to the Brain Police.
134024: They're convincingly painted drawers.
134052: Not bloody likely. Take a closer look.
134090: computer is doing the best it can to create a reality for you here. But
after all, you have only so many neurons, and overloading them would
necessitate a call to the Brain Police.
134216: You are in the middle of a living room. The room is sparsely furnished
in modern, chrome and black acrylic furniture. On one of the walls is a curtain
with an oddly familiar patterned fabric draped from floor to ceiling. Open
doorways lead off to the west and south, while a door lies off to the east.
134424: It is covered with a tiny, tight overlapping pattern of circles. The
curtain is
134480: You draw aside the curtain and see a window made of clear, hard
acrylic.
134532: You close the curtain. It falls silently back into place.
134576: You push it aside, see a window behind it, then let it fall silently
closed.
134632: It's overlapping circles which vaguely remind you of something you
might have seen in one of your physics classes.
134712: It's a clear, hard acrylic pane, mounted in the wall.
134752: It's just a sheet of plastic. You can't open it.
134788: You'll hurt your hand. The window isn't made of glass, you know.
134836: You see a large, crystal pyramid, surrounded by soft, blue grass.
134884: Who told you it was open? Certainly not I.
134916: Much as you'd like to take souvenirs from interesting places, you can't
take the window.
134980: It's far off in the blue grass.
135004: Your hand doesn't get past the acrylic window.
135040: It appears to be a pyramid made of crystal that glistens in the
sunlight.
135092: It's so blue, you think it might be water.
135124: You've heard of Kentucky Blue Grass? Well, this stuff makes that stuff
look green.
135188: Your hand doesn't get past the acrylic window.
135224: The chair is a futuristic chair, like a large egg with a large piece
taken out of its shell. Looks comfy.
135300: A nice way to break some fingers.
135324: You must have more than 10 toes! That hurt!
135360: This coffee table is little more than a slab of granite sitting on four
legs.
135416: The couch is a horrific design, little more than cushions on a
platform. The fabric is interesting, though not something you would have picked
for yourself.
135524: The fabric is cluttered with arcs and lines of what seem to be random
lengths, intersecting each other in what seems to be random chaotic patterns.
This is anything but inviting.
135648: You're in the dining room, complete with a dining room table and
chairs. There are three doorways here--one to the north, one to the west and
another to the east.
135764: This hardly seems normal... The doorway is just painted on the wall!
135816: The chairs are swept-back, graceful chairs unlike any you've seen.
135864: It's made of smoked grey acrylic. Tres chic.
135900: You're standing in the kitchen of the apartment with a doorway to the
east. Cabinets line the wall, broken by a large refrigerator beside a range.
The place looks sort of like your own apartment, but the floor is a wild
circular pattern and the ceiling is a light blue.
136088: On closer examination, it looks like the blue of the sky, with small
patchy white areas that might represent clouds. Still, art appreciation is not
your major, so you could just be seeing patterns where none exist.
136236: It's just a cube of metal with a door painted on its front.
136280: Howzat? There's no real door in it!
136308: It seems to be part of the incomplete image the computer is creating in
your mind. Too many objects, too few neurons.
136392: It's pretty hot. You sure? (Y/N)>
136424: Okay. I'll forget you even asked.
136452: The range elements emit a dull red glow.
136480: The range is completely warmed up now.
136508: Phew! Is it getting warm in here, or is it just me?
136548: You'd better think about getting off the range, amigo.
136588: Well, east is east and toast is toast, and warm though you might feel,
sitting on the range top for so many turns has rendered you unable to walk or
sit properly, now and in the future. What do you say we call it a day, okay?
136774: is no more. Burned to a crisp and then some.
136812: They're there, all right. Three-dimensional objects hanging on the wall
just like good kitchen cabinets should be. Only there are no doors on them.
136916: You'll have to teach me how to do that sometime. It's a little beyond
me!
136988: I computer's attempt to provide you with something reasonable here, but
it is obviously incomplete in its ability to image in your neurons.
137084: You are in the entry way to an apartment. The walls are white, the
floor a neutral beige. To the west lies a humming and buzzing corridor which
dissolves into a thick, foggy mist. Off to the east is the living room.
137236: You hear buzzing and humming as if from some highly-charged electrical
field.
137292: You're in a plain, old-fashioned bathroom. Painted on the wall, with
alarming detail, is a sink as well as a cabinet and a toilet. A real bathtub,
however, complete with claw feet, sits on the floor against a wall. A doorway
heads off to the west, through which you can see a dining room, while another
one leads off to the north, to the bedroom.
137536: This hardly seems normal... The doorway is just painted on the wall!
You press against it with your hand to ensure it is just an image and,
satisfied that it is, back away from it.
137664: It's clearly a well-rendered painting or photographic image and nothing
more.
137726: computer is doing the best it can to create a reality for you here, but
is probably overloaded. After all, it has only so many circuits and so much
memory.
137834: You put the jeans in the tub, swish them around until they're clean,
then remove them. They seem to dry immediately.
137920: You manage to clean the jeans using the soapy water in the dish.
137964: There's no convenient place to wash them.
137996: There's no need. There's already water in it.
138032: Sitting in the tub is some soapy water.
138060: As you ease your way slowly into the tub, your jeans become clean.
138130: nto it slowly. Ahh.
138148: They're typical of Victorian tubs and are just a set of feet supporting
the tub.
138204: Tepid soapy water isn't the greatest refreshment.
138240: You can't take the quantity of water.
138268: You are in a laboratory, buried deep within the Research Zone. Parts of
the lab seem oddly familiar, though most of it looks different from what you
remember. The walls are made of a strange translucent material which seem to
generate their own light from within. A black, acrylic shell which occupies the
center of the room lies
138496: . Passageways, like misty tunnels, spoke off the octagonal room in all
eight compass points.
138564: You jump up into the air, but can't seem to sustain any lift. So, for
now, you can't go in that direction.
138644: A little tough to manage with the lid shut.
138676: You're in a shell lit by an eerie, greenish glow. You feel very
claustrophobic.
138736: You hear a solemn click from within the dark womb of PARTI.
138780: As you lie down on the cold acrylic, your skin tightens into a thousand
goosebumps.
138840: A hologram of the lab appears before you. In it you see Dr. Dumont
busily monitoring equipment.
138908: As you open it, a bright flash of light momentarily blinds you. As your
sight returns, the room melts before your eyes. For an instant, eternal insight
into life is yours. A moment later, the Brain Police arrive.
139060: They're just a pair of coily wires.
139100: You can't connect the wires to that.
139128: The pair of wires is already connected.
139156: The pair of wires is already connected.
139184: The generator is creating electricity and it wouldn't be a good idea to
touch it now.
139244: They're electrified, so you touch the insulated part. You feel nothing
unexpected.
139304: They're electrified, and taking them would require your touching their
exposed, uninsulated areas. Not a good idea unless you see yourself as a piece
of burned toast.
139420: You detach the wires and take them.
139516: They're just two coily wires.
139540: They spring up out of your hands, yanked up to the ceiling and out of
reach.
139596: They're coiled up too far out of reach.
139624: The wires are yanked from your hands and coil up below.
139664: They're coiled up below, too far out of reach.
139700: You need to specify what you want to attach the wires to.
139740: You are floating like a cork in the water, bobbing on the air currents
at the top of the lab.
139804: You push down from the ceiling but float back up.
139840: What you dropped falls to the lab floor below.
139872: A white mist envelops you in mid-stride. The floor beneath you drops
away and you feel as though you are falling through space.
139960: It's dense, swirling mist unlike any you've seen before.
140004: A white mist envelops you in mid-stride. The floor beneath you drops
away and you feel as though you are falling through space.
140092: You are on a small front porch of a white clapboard building. There is
a small sign mounted on the wall. To the north is the front door into the
building, while a short pathway to the south dissolves into a white mist.
140244: The door is closed.
140260: The door is open.
140276: The sign says, "Welcome to the School of Thought, Professor Parti in
Residence."
140340: You are in a room that feels like a one-room schoolhouse, complete with
log walls and an old scuffed wood floor. In the center of the room is a
solitary student desk. The doorways to the north, east and west have small
plaques mounted over their door jambs. The northern plaque is gold, the western
one is silver, while the eastern one is crystal. An unlabeled doorway lies to
the south.
140700: You sit down. The viewscreen glows. Under the translucent acrylic,
thousands of pinpoints of colored light swirl in a strange dance like frenetic
microscopic creatures. They quickly coalesce into words.
140844: It's a square-inch pad of liquid crystal under soft plastic. It can be
pressed like a button.
140925: Good move.
140932: opalescent colors swirl under your fingers from the pressure. The
shapes on the viewscreen shift and change.
141008: It's made of a thick, clear acrylic.
141036: As you read the viewscreen, a strange yet pleasant voice reads along
with you, inside your mind. It's not your voice, either.
141160: "Congratulations! You have passed the DNA requirement which qualifies
you for the exam. Your genes are clean. Be advised: Cheating will result in
insanity."
141276: "Sorry, but you don't have clean jeans. You have failed to qualify for
the exam. Testing procedures suspended."
141360: Welcome to the School of Thought. To qualify for the exam, place your
palms on the viewscreen. A DNA scan on your jeans will ensue. You will feel no
pain. Have a nice day.
141758: pad to receive your first koan. Good luck. And have a nice day.
141804: We have an effect on what is viewed at the subatomic level. Observation
of the macrocosm may help you understand the physical manifestations of the
true Zen mind: emptiness. Here is your first koan: "What effect can one have on
something which doesn't exist?"
141988: A by-product of accelerating a particle, an atom, or a molecule is
heat. Here is your second koan: "Why does one speed to create a nectar which
brings one to rest?"
142108: All objects are divisible. Even subatomic particles. In theory, you
could divide the smallest thing in the universe infinitely. Here is your third
koan: "What is the sound of one duck quacking?"
142248: To enter the core of Reality is to know all potential paths for all
potential particles simultaneously. This includes all the potential "yous."
Your fourth koan is: "How can one be two places at once when you're not
anywhere at all?"
142416: As a physicist, you know that matter cannot be created or
destroyed--only transformed. As a metaphysicist, you must learn that death,
too, is only a state before another transformation. Here is your fifth and
final koan: "How can one be on time when dead?"
142598: As you finish reading the final koan, a small card about the size of a
credit card appears on the desk.
142674: You place your palms on the screen. The text scatters like a swarm of
fireflies, replaced by a warm, soft, purple light. The light passes beneath
your palms in a narrow band, warming them, and the tiny dancing lights reappear
and merge into words. You take your hands away from the screen.
142880: The plaque over the doorway reads, "Zen".
142912: The plaque over the doorway reads, "Philosophy".
142948: The plaque over the doorway reads, "Metaphysics".
143072: . An instant later, you are back in a classroom. The walls, ceiling and
floor appear to be singing, vibrating, humming, bursting with inner light.
Along one wall is a long chalkboard with writing on it.
143232: Chaos Cohen, attending professor."
143272: Lorenzo Buck Way, to show you the way of Zen."
143320: Gravity's Kite Races."
143340: Just as your lips finish moving, the amazing Doctor Gravity puffs into
reality in a wisp of tutti-frutti smelling smoke. He floats a few inches off
the floor, spots a hook for his black professorial robe, and makes a strange
hand-wave. The robe floats from his shoulders and settles on the hook near the
ceiling.
143560: It's a professor's robe, black, similar to a graduation gown. A little
tag on the collar says, "Come fly with me."
143644: The robe floats up and out of your reach as you think of doing that. It
then cautiously floats back down onto the hook.
143728: You slip the loose-fitting robe over your shoulders.
143768: You bob like a cork on the water, a few feet in the air.
143892: The robe has been known to help people be light on their feet.
143936: The handbook creates a hologram before your eyes of a robe floating
down from a hook. Before you realize it's happening, the robe is by your feet.
144040: You see an image of a diploma, minus the astronomical student loans,
floating before you.
144104: You are in a small, stark but modern classroom. The floor is black,
made of a highly polished acrylic; the walls are made of the same material. The
room looks more like a stark office in a modern office building than a
classroom. A green chalkboard, with writing on it, covers a whole wall.
144308: He could be a twin brother to Professor Parti, but he wears wide-rim
glasses, has bushy eyebrows, sports a huge cigar and has a greasepaint
mustache.
144414: Chaos Cohen wiggles his eyebrows and paces nervously around the room.
144468: "You are sort of absolutely sort of correct about that, so here you go.
Perhaps it will serve you better than it served me. Then again, perhaps not."
He shakes his head. "It's yours, in either case."
144616: "Please! No more answers! I'm confused enough!"
144656: "That's easy for you to say," he says. "As a matter of fact, it's easy
for me to say, too. Maybe it's easy for anyone to say. I don't know... this
philosophy stuff is so confusing."
144792: "Sure sure. Take off just when things were getting frustrating," he
says.
144848: "Well, it's interesting you should ask that. Did I say that? Did I say
interesting? I meant vaccinating." he says.
144936: "One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas," Chaos says. "What he
was doing in my pajamas, I'll never know."
145020: "Did I just hear the secret word? Nah, I bet that was some other game,"
he says.
145080: "You can have it as long as you tell me what's in it," he says.
145128: "Well, it's interesting you should ask that. Did I say that? Did I say
interesting? I meant vaccinating," he says.
145216: "Why, it's a book for the hands, a focus, you might say. Or I might
say. Wait, that is what I said."
145296: "I was born in a humble log cabin, or at least a virtual log cabin.
Beyond that, I couldn't tell you. Well, I could," he says, "but I won't."
145404: "You? Why, you look like yourself, talk like yourself, and mostly are
yourself. What more could a self ask for?"
145488: "I use it to unteach students what the world has taught them," he says
philosophically.
145552: "You've got the brain of a four-year-old boy, and I'll bet he was glad
to get rid of it," he says.
145628: "I never forget a face, but in your case I'll be glad to make an
exception," he says.
145692: "One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas," Chaos says. "What he
was doing in my pajamas, I'll never know."
145776: "Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana," he says.
145824: He turns as if talking to someone else in the room. "He may look like
an idiot and talk like an idiot but don't let that fool you. He really is an
idiot," he says.
145940: Scared by an early film called "Phantom of the Opera," Chaos Cohen
patterned his life after the chaos of the Marx Brothers. He would rather answer
a question with a joke than with anything serious.
146080: The hardback book has the word "HANDBOOK" printed on its cover. The
cover has strange openings along the bottom edge which form the "wrist part" of
the outline of a human hand. These openings look like gloves sewn onto the
cover.
146248: You open it, leaf through the blank pages, then close it.
146292: Perhaps if you were holding it, it might make reading it easier.
146340: I don't think there's anything written in it.
146376: You open it, see blank pages, then shut it.
146408: In real estate, the main thing to remember is, "Location, location,
location." In meditation, the only important thing to remember is, "Focus,
focus, focus."
146528: This room is eerie in its silence since it is filled with students.
They appear to be in some kind of trance. Each student sits in the lotus
position on a tatami mat on the floor, eyes closed. Behind one row of students
is a long chalkboard with some writing on it.
146712: Consider yourself off your feet.

In a "poof" of purple smoke and a
harp glissando, Lorenzo "Buck" Way appears. With a child-like innocence, he
silently ogles all the pretty blonde women in class.
146856: It's made of straw.
146872: According to ancient ritual, tatami mats must first be on the floor.
146920: In real estate, the main thing to remember is, "Location, location,
location." In meditation, the only important thing to remember is, "Focus,
focus, focus."
147040: They seem not to hear you. Their eyes are shut in deep meditation.
147088: What are you doing, making a vodka martini? Leave them alone!
147132: None of them seem to even notice your presence, let alone want to
answer your queries.
147192: You put on the wig and have the sudden impulse to chase a few blondes.
147276: You remove the wig and feel more like yourself.
147312: This wig is bright red, curly and a fine addition to anyone's wardrobe.
147364: This membership card reads, "The bearer of this card is a member in
good standing in the association associated with bearers of this card. In
addition, the bearer of this card is entitled to all the benefits and
privileges associated with the bearer of this card, this card itself, and all
associated associations' cards and bearers of cards." The bottom of the card is
signed by Peerof Rayjuh, Confucian Department, Infernal Affairs.
147668: ," Parti says. "One of the elite! Pardon me." And with a flash of
teeth, shown in a smile, he "poofs" out of view.
147756: ! Not everyone gets one of those," he says. "As a matter of fact, I
wouldn't mind having one myself."
147832: This membership card shows you're a member in good standing, sitting or
reclining.
147890: He's small, with dark hair, dressed in a vested suit with a thin black
tie.
147948: Professor Parti appears in a puff of emerald-green smoke.
147992: He strides over to the front door and closes it.
148104: "When you're ready, be seated at the desk," the professor says, "so you
can start your exam. Make sure you take the whole thing, as it will help you
focus your observations."
148264: "His genius is all but forgotten in the annals of his story," Parti
says. "Some day I wish to be just like him. And today's the day!"
148364: "What a cornball! All he can think about is moo, moo, moo!" he says,
laughing.
148424: "It's no housecat, I promise you that. It does like to take catnaps, as
do we all," he says.
148496: "Now there's a fine figure of a man, if I do say so myself. And I do
say so myself."
148560: "God bless them. And while we're at it, God bless me, too. And you,
too, especially, for buying this godforsaken game!" he shouts.
148660: "You've heard of the nectar of the gods? Well, IF is the 'game of the
gods'" he says.
148728: "An amusing little diversion. You might want to call upon Zork sometime
in your wanderings."
148796: "Ah, what I wouldn't give for a good five-cent cigar," he moans.
148848: "Why, that means, 'Way' or 'Path.' You must have been visiting my pal
Buckie!"
148912: "Why is it that when you drive by a herd of cows (yes, I've heard of
cows) you are compelled to go 'moo'?"
148992: He waves his arms before him. "Danger, Will Robinson! Warning!"
149044: "Like all the 'isms', Buddhism is the study of what isn't apparent," he
quips.
149104: "What can I say about myself which hasn't already been said?" He
ponders this a moment. "Well, I'm one hell of a dancer!"
149196: "Your exam will be presented and graded on the desk," he says. "Just
follow its instructions."
149268: "Ah, the exam," he says. "We must prepare for the observation by
ensuring you are in the proper frame of mind. That is if any frame of mind can
be proper."
149380: "The petting zoo is the place I go to get rid of the cares and worries
of my life, such as it is."
149452: "He's my kind of coder," Parti says. "And your's, too! We who have
hopelessly confused you owe him a great debt of gratitude."
149548: "He was the best beta tester ever. Why, without him, I'd be nowhere, as
opposed to virtually nowhere."
149624: "These koans are useful in creating a state of mind which releases you
from your standard mode of thought," he says. 'They help you better think about
the problems at hand. Or feet. Or any other part of the body, for that matter."
149788: "Well it's first, that much I can tell you."
149824: "Hmmm... let me think about that," he says. "Does it follow the first?"
149880: "Oh, come on, now. Isn't this line of thought getting old?"
149928: "We seek observations which are not in the normal frame of mind," he
says. "That is your goal, and all of our tasks here are to help you achieve
that."
150036: "Nice installation, isn't it?" he asks. "Well, not every virtual
reality has such a nice projector."
150112: "It's made by the Goto Corporation. Nice piece of work. We also use it
for laser light shows."
150184: "Uhm, well, the Aggies come in from the hinterlands to have some fun
there," he says.
150248: "We store all kinds of useful exhibits there. My favorite is the
three-legged animals. Unfortunately, it was removed after they could find none
with which to populate it."
150456: "Ah yes, Zen. The opposite, and so equal, to chaos. An opportunity to
think and observe the world through a different set of eyes. Though yours are
quite nice."
150572: "He's a nice enough sort of guy. If I'm not mistaken, he doesn't miss
much."
150632: "Be careful when you take the quiz. And remember the 'Tao,' or 'Way'
you're on."
150696: "It's a focus aid. You should drop it, sit on it, and think about
something to help you better understand it."
150776: "Linked to Zen and Physics? Linked to Meta and Physics? You look it up
and tell me!" he says.
150848: "Once you're genetically scanned, the desk will give you the exam you
need to help you better understand what you'll see."
150936: "I just love doors. The way they close by themselves, the way the open
when you open them," he says.
151008: "You ain't goin' nowhere without that sheepskin, baby," he says.
151056: "Be kind to your web-footed friends," he says, "and they'll be kind to
you."
151116: "Get down," he says, grinning. "Or at least, get feathers."
151164: "Yes sir, step right up to nibblet a giblet. Why, a finer club wouldn't
have me for a member."
151236: "What's to know, Junior. You know what a pinata is, don't you?" he asks
indignantly. "Don't you?!?! he shouts. He then smiles and leans toward you,
whispering, "If you find out, you will let me know, won't you."
151400: "Why, it's where we teach you what you need to know, and where you
teach us what you've seen. See? Si!"
151480: "Why, a finer looking particle I've never partied with, particularly
its partitioned pie-shaped...er...well, I like 'em!"
151576: "You're here to help me, and I'm here to help you. Nice the way that
works, eh?" he says.
151644: "What are you bothering me for? And when did you learn to talk?" he
asks.
151700: "Don't listen to him," Parti says. "I never do."
151740: "Funny, you look a lot like him," Parti says.
151776: "Let me think about that." He poses as if thinking. "Okay. Now it's
your turn." He waits a few moments, and then says, "Cohen is like a brother to
me. The idiot brother I never wanted."
151916: "He may look like an idiot and talk like an idiot but don't let that
fool you. He really is an idiot."
151992: "Why, they unlock the door to the imagination. Err... perhaps that was
learning." He shakes his head. "Just fetch the keys after reading the exam.
It's so simple, a child of five could do it." He turns to his left and shouts,
"Fetch me a child of five!"
152180: "You can't tell the players without a scorecard, so this is my way of
telling who's who in playerville," he says.
152264: "What, did you get one? A speeding ticket for thinking too fast? Watch
out for those Brain Police," he says, winking.
152352: "What's the matter with you? Can't read, eh?"
152388: "Never heard of him! Have you? Have you what? What's that? Never mind,
you lost me," he says.
152460: "Genius! Sheer genius like hers has never before been seen!" He leans
in and whispers to you, "You think she heard that? Now maybe we can get on with
the game at hand, eh?"
152588: "Genius! Sheer genius like his has never before been seen!" He leans in
and whispers to you, "You think he heard that? Now maybe we can get on with the
game at hand, eh?"
152712: "Geniuses! Sheer genius like theirs has never before been seen!" He
leans in and whispers to you, "You think they heard that? Now maybe we can get
on with the game at hand, eh?"
152840: "It's like this, junior," he says, "one minute you're a vibrant, living
virtual being, the next you're nothing but a series of ons and offs on a... oh,
I guess you mean for you, eh?" He sees you nod and continues, "Well, after you
see what God... er... Dumont has sent you here to see (great guy, that Dumont),
the system starts it's shutdown phase. You don't want to see that. Best close
your eyes to that."
153144: "You want me to say I'm just a shell of my former self? Is that it?"
153196: "I stay out of there. Too scary for me," he says.
153236: "Dumont is the big to our small, the great to our average, and one hell
of a smart guy," he says. "And he's probably listening right now."
153336: "Red is such a flattering color on you," he says, batting his
eyelashes.
153388: "An interesting and deep subject. Worthy of your study, no doubt!" he
exclaims.
153446: "Funny you should ask. I just happen to have a list of them right
here!" he exclaims.
153512: "Hmmm... Let me ponder that for a decade or two. In the meantime, make
yourself comfortable. And while you're at it, make me one, too."
153616: "Well, that's an interesting question, as questions go," he says. "So,
just how do questions go anywhere at all?"
153700: "I'd like to think about that for a moment. Okay, I thought about it.
What an unrewarding experience."
153776: "You would ask me that, and after all we've been through together."
153828: "It's nice to meet me! In fact, it's nice to meet you!" he says
gleefully.
153884: Parti says, "Earn it and it's yours."
153916: Professor Parti has been known to be in two places at once and not
anywhere at all, at the same time. He can't leave well enough alone, butts in
when least expected, and watches everything you do. I don't mean to make you
paranoid, but as the old adage goes, "You don't have to be paranoid to have
someone following you."
154144: It says, "The bearer of this diploma is a graduate in good standing
from the School of Thought, we think. Good for one graduation ceremony."
154248: Why, as anyone knows, a diploma is the key to your future.
154290: Doctor Gravity is a light-hearted, jovial fellow with short, curly
black hair. He wears a funny, conical hat made of soft felt and has quick, dark
eyes. His teeth blind you when he smiles. When he stands still, he seems to
float as though his feet never quite touch the ground.
154488: Doc Gravity bobs like a cork a little off the floor.
154526: Doc Gravity floats a few inches off the ground, drifting about on the
balmy breeze.
154588: "She's a nice," he says, "but I know nothing about that."
154636: Doc shakes his head. "These-a mine," he says.
154672: Doc Gravity shakes his head. "It's-a mine," he says.
154716: The Doctor releases the kite into the wind. "Good-a luck," he says.
154768: Doc shakes his head. "These-a mine," he says.
154804: Doc Gravity shakes his head. "It's-a mine," he says.
154848: "I no know nothing about-a that. That's-a Buck's domain."
154896: "It helps-a me with my diet. Keeps me light off my feet." He grins.
154948: "I need-a them to see what I can't see," he says. "See?"
154996: "When you ready to race, you just say, 'DOC, RELEASE KITE' and the
race, she be on!"
155068: "I hope-a you like it. We spent a lot of time making it up," he says.
155120: "You a nice enough guy. You're observant and quick. Quick enough? I
don't-a know," he says.
155192: "That's-a the way you stay inna course. You rave the kite in there."
155244: "You read the banner, you find out what's-a what," he says.
155292: "I'm a nice-a guy. I bet you think I'm a nice-a guy. Of course, I like
betting on anything."
155364: "Yes, that's-a where you are! Who could be luckier? Well, I think about
it and get back to you."
155440: "Why, it's a nice thing, you know. Keeps me grounded," he says.
155492: "Why it's a simple thing: You race the kite. You win, you get a prize.
You lose, you get to try again!"
155572: "Why, he's a good man, almost like," he pauses for a moment, "a brother
to me."
155632: "That's-a what I teach, no? You wanna teach it, you be my guest!"
155684: "Ah, it's a no tough. It's a fun exam. You take it and learn!"
155736: "It's a my class. An I got plenty of it," he says.
155776: "The keys she unlocks the brain, after you put them in the desk and
turn them."
155832: "You earn it and she's-a yours," he says.
155864: "Whataya want I should say, eh? Meet me afta you win the game and we
chat then," the doc says.
155936: "Well, that's-a interesting, but I no can help you there," he says.
155988: "Whataya want I should say, eh? Meet me afta the game and we chat
then," the doc says.
156052: Doc Gravity is a lighter-than-air kind of guy who grew up in
Levitatown. Always on a diet, his favorite food is celery. He once looked at a
cheesecake and couldn't get up for three hours.
156186: Lorenzo "Buck" Way, "Buckie" to his friends, has a mass of tight, red
curly hair and a child-like face. He doesn't say much of anything. Ever. He
does, however, run around a lot tooting his own horn.
156338: Lorenzo Way seems highly amused as he leans against a wall.
156384: He scrunches up his face to form a "gookie" face and looks like he's
very upset! He does calm down quickly, waggling his finger at you in an
admonishing manner.
156496: With that question, Lorenzo does a fast burn and looks totally hot
under the collar. He huffs and puffs a few times as he tries to form the answer
and words, then explodes in a blast of fucshia-colored smoke! A curly red wig
floats to the ground where he had been standing.
156688: He smiles innocently, points to his mouth, then shakes his head.
156736: Lorenzo nods his head, makes his lips into a big "O", squints his eyes
shut, then runs around in circles.
156812: Lorenzo is a man of conviction, committed to absolute silence in his
search for "Truth." He meditates on life, liberty and the pursuit of blondes,
brunettes and redheads.
156932: A white mist envelops you in mid-stride. The floor beneath you drops
away and you feel as though you are falling through space.
157020: Before you stretches a prairie of soft, blue grass that melts into the
horizon. Off to the east towers a huge pyramid made of glistening crystal,
while off to the southwest the trail disappears into a dense, white mist.
157172: You stand before a gleaming pyramid that rises up and blocks out the
sun. As you shift your head from side to side, sunlight is refracted and
reflected in a prismatic display. A long, blue prairie stretches out to the
west while a barely-worn path starts up, leading off to the east.
157368: Before you can do anything, Doc Gravity arrives in a puff of earthy
smelling smoke. He snaps a finger in time to some unheard melody, grinning and
chuckling. He appears to be reading a flyer.
157504: It's a pyramid made of crystal, like the pepper grinder you gave to
your folks on their anniversary. The opening is carved right into its south
side.
157608: It's a monument to crystalline structures all over the world.
157652: You see an image of an Egyptian wearing glasses standing before a huge
bear.
157708: You are outside a corral with a fence which goes all the way around it.
Doc Gravity stands by the fence, smiling, watching the clouds drift by on the
gentle breeze. A banner flies overhead.
157840: "That's-a nice you winnagen, but I got-a no prize for you," he says.
157896: Doctor Gravity smiles his crooked smile. "Hey, that's-a great! You
win-a the race! Here. For your reward," he says, holding out his glasses.
158006: You look around and see Doc Gravity holding the kite. Somehow, the
thing beat you over the finish line.
158084: The banner reads: THE INCREDIBLE KITE RACES!
158132: A wooden fence blocks your way but for the southeast, south and
southwest.
158184: A wooden fence blocks your way to the west, northwest and north.
158236: A wooden fence blocks your way to the north, northeast and east.
158284: A wooden fence blocks your way except for the northeast, east and
southeast. There's an exit through the fence to the west.
158384: A wooden fence blocks the way in every direction but the southwest,
west and northwest.
158444: A wooden fence blocks your way to the south, southwest and west.
158496: A wooden fence blocks your way to the east, southeast and south.
158544: A wooden fence blocks your way in all directions but northwest, north
and northeast.
158604: You are inside the crystal pyramid, standing before a crystal pedestal.
The sunlight streams in through the walls. Each wall has hundreds of thousands
of facets, and each facet creates dazzling kaleidoscopic effects and reflects
countless images of you. The reflectivity of the walls and facets begin to
disorient you as the images seem to have a life of their own.
158856: No matter where you go, there you are!
158884: You try, but your vision is so confused, your hands close on empty air.
158936: It's almost impossible to distinguish it from the facets!
158976: You try, but your arms swing on empty air.
159008: It seems to be some sort of support structure for an exhibit or
something.
159060: You need to ge holding it to give it a really good hug.
159100: You hug the teddy to your chest and could swear you feel it hugging
back. You feel at ease and calm.
159172: . In the back of the bear is a yellow key
159204: An image of the little Teddy Bear you had as a child floats above the
book. You start to feel sleepy and long for a comfortable bed.
159296: It's a yellow key. Its shaft is in the shape of a triangle.
159340: They're made from prisms and work like a teleidoscope.
159378: This is the same flyer as was included in your game package, you lucky
devil, you! The cover of it reads:

*** Come one Come all***
The Grand and
Glorious
but not too dangerous
Rules to the
Kite Races
are on the
reverse side!
159560: An image of your game package comes to mind.
159592: It's just some kite made from paper, sticks and string.
159632: That would violate the race rules.
159656: You think about the tachyon. In a flash, the book shows you the
following:
159712: A white mist envelops you in mid-stride. The floor beneath you drops
away and you feel as though you are falling through space.
159800: You are standing on the sidewalk, directly outside the entrance to a
large, ancient building. Above the entrance is a sign which says, "Science Art
Museum." The sidewalk continues off to the south along the west edge of the
building.
159968: The grass has been recently watered.
159996: You're at a corner on the sidewalk which travels around the Museum. The
sidewalk goes off to the north and east. To the south and west are beautiful
lawns of manicured grass.
160120: You are in a northwest corner of the Science Art Museum. Before you is
a small but interesting exhibit.
160196: The exhibit is made up of a bubble wand and a soap dish. The
instructions say "Dip the wand in the soapy water and then blow on the wand.
The soap film catches the light and creates beautiful prismatic displays. Have
a nice day."
160356: Hey, this is one hi-tech piece of equipment: a piece of plastic with a
loop on one end of it.
160424: Fairy tales can come true... it can happen to you...
160464: Bubbles appear and then are immediately popped by some invisible
particle traveling at near lightspeed.
160536: It's a thin chain which prevents people like you from walking off with
pieces of the exhibit.
160600: Who do you think you are, Hercules? And besides, this isn't a pen
chained to a counter in a bank.
160672: It's a wide but shallow dish, perfectly designed for dipping the bubble
wand.
160728: It's sudsy water, perfect for dipping.
160756: You can't have the water. What would others play with?
160796: Come on! You have any idea of what soap will do to someone? It's not a
pleasant experience.
160864: You are in the northern area of the Science Art Museum. Before you,
behind glass is a laser exhibit. Sitting on a little pedestal is a computer
terminal.
160976: A small sign on the terminal reads: To access laser, type your security
clearance codeword.
161040: The Brain Police arrive, shake their fingers at you, then carry you
away for regrooving.
161104: Don't mess with a security device. The Brain Police won't like it.
161156: You type the word again. Nothing happens.
161188: As soon as you type the security code, the laser's case pops open,
giving you access to the laser.
161308: Hmmm... seems to be made out of some unbreakable acrylic.
161352: It's an Acme All-purpose Genuine Laser, just like the cardboard one you
cut out from the back of the cereal box you had as a child.
161448: The laser is locked up in the exhibit.
161476: You are in the northeast corner of the Science Art Museum.
161518: You leave the wires behind as you leave the area.
161556: Sitting on the floor is a crystal pyramid. Etched into the crystal is a
picture of a laser.
161620: Sitting on its point in precarious balance is a large circular slab of
glass.
161676: Connected to the slab are a set of wires.
161708: The wires trail off to the south.
161732: Littering the area are thousands of sharp shards of glass.
161776: Looks just like a pedestal made of crystal, which really isn't that odd
since that's what it is.
161844: You can see tiny wires running through it in a tight grid. On one end
of the slab is a piece where you can attach wires. Its balance looks precarious
at best.
161956: Attached to the slab are a set of wires.
161988: The wires head off to the south.
162012: The tiny wires inside the slab light up like a liquid crystal display,
and show you the following: Type the following codeword for security clearance:
162140: i computer, no quote marks are necessary. Have a nice day.
162182: The glass slab totters for a moment, teeters for a moment, and then
falls from its balancing point. * Tinkle. Crash. * Oh oh. This can't be good.
162384: Ouch! Very nasty, very sharp. Leave 'em be!
162420: You are standing by the entrance of the Science Art Museum. The hall is
tremendous in proportion, stretching out in all directions. The ceiling towers
high overhead. To the west is the exit.
162556: You're in the center of the Science Art Museum. Before you stands a
pedestal on which is mounted a guide to some of the museum's exhibits.
162716: in the center of the hall with the words, "You are here." The northwest
part of the sign has the word "Particle Generator" over it, the north portion
has a label of "Light Exhibit" while the east side says, "Progress through the
Ages." The southwest corner of the sign says, "Early Edison," while the south
portion is labeled, "Our modern oasis."
162972: You are in the east side of the Science Art Museum. Before you, sitting
along the wall, is a long table. The table houses two exhibits: a generator and
a waterwheel. The generator sits on the northern end of the table and is
connected to the waterwheel by a leather belt.
163162: You leave the wires behind as you leave the area.
163200: Water rushes out of the pipe over the waterwheel, turning it. The
leather belt connecting the waterwheel and the generator turns.
163292: The belt connects the generator to the water wheel.
163328: A set of wires is attached to the generator.
163360: It's a scaled-down generator, capable of putting out electricity. One
end of it is connected to the waterwheel, while the other has a place for
connecting wires.
163476: A pair of wires are connected to the generator.
163512: The wires head off to the north.
163536: A pipe leads into the side of the chamber from the east.
163576: A pipe is mounted high on the wall, right below the ceiling. The pipe
heads off to the north and the west.
163652: Directly over the waterwheel exhibit is the mouth of a pipe. The pipe
goes up to the ceiling, then turns off to the south.
163740: A steady stream of water comes out of the pipe and turns the
waterwheel. The belt on the waterwheel then turns the generator, powering it.
163836: You are in the southwest corner of the Science Art Museum. Before you
is a small plaque.
163900: "These rocks are marvels of nature. They naturally fluoresce for hours
once exposed to natural light."
163972: The exhibit is of glowing rocks of the world.
164004: If you didn't know better, this rock could have been included in some
text adventure's package you played just a decade or more ago.
164096: Beats me. It's some phosphorescent rock.
164164: You are in the south area of the Science Art Museum. Before you, to the
south, stands a huge chamber made of steel plates riveted together. An
oversized door is visible in the structure. Beside the door is a small dial. A
drain is in the floor by your feet.
164346: Water drains out of the chamber, over the door's edge, and out a drain
in the floor.
164412: The chamber extends into the room and looks like it's very sturdy. It's
big enough to hold several people with ease.
164496: It's a heavy door made of steel. The
164524: A rush of water empties from the chamber and into the drain.
164568: A surge of water rushes out the door and knocks you over. You splash
around until you regain your feet.
164640: A huge wall of water rushes out of the door, pushing you backward where
you smash into the directory.
164712: Like a tsunami, an immense wall of water rushes through the doorway,
smashing your fragile body to the hard ground.
164876: 0". The needle points at the
164900: You are in a huge chamber made of steel. On the south wall you can see
a large hole, near the floor, going out of the chamber. Mounted on the wall
right next to the pipe is a small handle. On the chamber's east wall is a small
hole which leads out, no doubt connected to the pipe in the museum. Adjacent to
this hole is a handle. Beside the door on the north wall of the chamber is a
huge wheel alongside a huge pipe which comes down from the ceiling.
165212: Water rushes out of the huge pipe which comes down from the ceiling.
165260: The water drains out the hole in the south wall.
165296: The water drains into the museum.
165320: The water seems to be filling the chamber.
165352: A solitary drop of water comes out of the huge pipe overhead and
quickly disappears.
165412: It's like the handle to a faucet, made of brass.
165448: The handle is in the open position.
165476: The handle is in the closed position.
165504: What can I tell you about a hole? Let me see... it's rather empty, by
definition, and it lacks any content, by definition...
165600: Well, it's the lack of something, or an opening through or into
something.
165656: You are in the southeast corner of the Science Art Museum.
165700: You're midway down the east-west sidewalk, outside the museum, on the
south side. Off the sidewalk, to the north, is a narrow dirt path.
165800: You're at the east end of the sidewalk. All around you but to the west
is carefully manicured grass.
165872: You are at the north end of a small dirt path, standing directly in
front of the wall of the Science Art Museum. In the wall, about a meter off the
ground, is a small faucet attached to a pipe. The pipe goes down into the
ground.
166064: Let's face it. You ain't no guppy. So you drown.
166104: It looks like the pipe heads out of the south wall of the building and
down into the ground.
166168: The lawns are being watered by an underground sprinkler system.
166212: A white mist envelops you in mid-stride. The floor beneath you drops
away and you feel as though you are falling through space.
166300: You are standing in the theater entrance, a narrow alcove. A ticket
window to your right is manned by an odd-looking "gentleman." Directly across
from the window is an encased bulletin board. The top of the board bears the
label "Cultural Events." A set of swinging doors lies off to the south, leading
into the theater, while a misty passageway can be seen heading off to the
north. A narrow alley, going alongside the building, starts up to the
southwest.
166624: Oh oh. Here come the Brain police! Told you so! Nyah Nyah!
166672: Don't be a trouble-maker. The Brain Police might be right around the
corner.
166728: An image of you and Parti striding through the doors floats above the
handbook.
166784: The window has a round opening for speaking into and a small,
half-circle opening at its bottom for passing things back and forth.
166876: You see an odd-looking man behind the window. Needless to say, he looks
vaguely familiar.
166940: The ticket taker (and manager of the theater), Ty Kett, is dressed in a
handsome, maroon cardigan.
167014: The manager for the Point of View Theater, Ty Kett, sits behind the
glass, smiling expectantly.
167088: Ty shakes his head. "Sorry, but the Fred, A Star, Dance Night is sold
out. There are a few reserve seats for grads of SOT, but you've got to show
your DOT--Diploma of Thought, that is."
167232: He gets a slightly crazed look in his one good eye and then quickly
engages you in conversation. He chats about Point of View and its importance in
creating reality, and nearly bores you to tears until he gives you a Stage Play
Magazine.
167400: He expounds on all the virtues of goodliness, a full tank of gas, and a
clean windshield.
167464: "He's quite the performer, but I would warn you that getting to see him
isn't all that easy," he says.
167540: "I heard that you can earn one at the School of Thought," he says.
167592: "Oh, it's published to help people better enjoy the programs," he says.
167644: "It's the last one available for the SRO show of Fred, A Star," he
says.
167704: "You seem like a nice enough person," he says.
167740: "He's my favorite guy," he says. "A little brilliant, a little
eccentric, but nice none-the-less."
167816: "What's to say?" he asks. "I just sell and take tickets."
167864: "There is where it all happens, you know. Or perhaps you don't know.
But I know, and that's what counts." He looks at his hands. "Well I count on my
fingers when I have to, but I don't usually have to, you know. Or perhaps you
don't," he says.
168048: "You need a backstage pass to get back there, but there isn't one, so
you'll have to figure out some other way to get back there, you sneaky little
devil, you."
168164: "The best seats in the house are in the Main Seating Area," he says.
168216: "Don't make me tell you about those, please?" He looks at you with
puppy dog eyes, then sees your relentless glare. "Okay. There's the Bluegrass
Special, Dr. Gravity's Kite Races, Zero-Gravity Racquetball, and the Aggie
UnFair at the Fair Grounds. You might want to attend the School Of Thought
Graduation Ceremonies right here, after you get your diploma, of course."
168492: "Gee, I don't know much about that. But there's a bubble blowing wand
in the Science Art Museum."
168568: "My contract prohibits my talking about such subjects," he says,
anxiously glancing over his shoulder.
168640: "Gee, as far as I know, she's Fred's dance partner."
168684: "Hmmm... I know little about that. Very little, in fact. They don't
tell me much," he says.
168756: "Well, a new grad! Mind if I join you?" he asks, peeling off his
sweater to reveal his suit beneath. A "SOLD OUT" sign appears at the booth.
"Let's go! There's plenty of seating in the main area!" Parti says,
dematerializing from inside the booth then materializing at your elbow.
168964: Ty seems completely uninterested in that.
168996: Ty likes his job as the ticket salesman at the Point of View Theater.
He gets to see most of the shows that take place here, so you might say his
motto is, "Observing is the better part of working."
169136: It's a Stage Play Magazine for Dance Night with Fred, A Star, at the
Point of View Theater. It's followed by a short bio.
169232: Perhaps you should take it from Ty, first?
169584: It's in the magazine, which you don't seem to have.
169624: Perhaps you should take the magazine first?
169656: The bulletin board is inset into the wall and has cultural listings
tacked up inside of it that you can read.
169730: Fred, A Star, live on stage at the POV Theater! Dance Night is Sold

169992: Well, you can't see much more unless you enter it.
170096: You're standing at the bottom of a massive, carpeted staircase. The
staircase rises up to the south, while a set of swinging doors lead out of the
theater to the north. Two other carpeted hallways slope down from here-- one to
the southeast, the other to the southwest. The fixtures, including the
banisters, are gold-leafed. The walls are covered with thick flocked wallpaper
in deep red.
170368: There are two halls going down. Better use a direction.
170408: You're standing at the top of a massive staircase. The steps descend
out of sight to the north. To the south is a large balcony, complete with what
look like plush, comfortable seats.
170536: You are in the theater's balcony, overlooking the main seating area
below. There are plenty of empty seats here.
170616: I've heard of breaking a leg... but that's going to far.
170660: They're beautiful, imitation red velour.
170692: Only Siskel and Ebert can sit here. These are reserved!
170736: You're at the bottom of a gentle, sloping hallway that goes upward to
the northeast. Off to the east, through an ornately-carved, baroque archway, is
the west side of the main theater's seating area.
171020: You are in the east side of the main seating area of the theater. The
central seating stretches off to the west, while the stage starts to the south.
An open doorway lies off to the east.
171152: The orchestra pit prevents you from going there.
171188: You're in the middle of the theater, in the main seating area. The
orchestra pit, before the stage, lies off to the south.
171276: The orchestra pit prevents you from going there.
171312: You are in the west side of the main seating area of the theater. The
central seating stretches off to the east, while the stage starts to the south.
An exit door lies off to the west.
171440: The orchestra pit prevents you from going there.
171476: They're beautiful, imitation red velour.
171506: As soon as you sit, Parti sits beside you. The house lights dim as he
jabs you in the ribs with his elbow. "Get ready!" he whispers. You can hear the
tension and excitement in his voice.

Suddenly, the orchestra pit is filled
with musicians and a huge fanfare sounds. The stage is instantly packed with
dancing women, all with ultra-long legs, like Rockettes, dressed in almost
blindingly red sequined costumes. They kick their legs in wild abandon. Then, a
silver ball, about the size of a beachball, rolls onto the stage! Legs sprout
from its bottom as it colorfully spins and charms its way across the stage in a
soft-shoe number. It sports a top hat and a cane and you realize it's got to be
Fred, A Star!

Fireworks begin and Fred vanishes.

Parti springs to his feet.
"I think that was just what I needed to see, amigo mio," he shouts. "I'm going
backstage to see that new performer on my own. Thanks for your particular
help!"'

Three rows back, Paul Newmanski jumps up from the audience and shouts,
"Fire!" in German. The walls melt. Everything melts. Rockettes red glaring and
people twist and shout.

You leap to your feet and run for your life. You make
it outside.
172356: You are standing by the northeast edge of the theater at the start of a
north/south alley. The theater alcove lies off to the northeast while off to
the west is a shimmering misty area.
172484: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
172516: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
172548: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
172584: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
172620: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
172656: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
172692: You are standing midway down a north/south alleyway. Off to the east is
a stage door, beside which stands an old, rusty fire escape.
172788: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
172820: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
172852: The stage door is locked.
172872: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
172908: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
172944: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
172980: It looks like many fires have escaped using this structure.
173024: It's a locked, bolted, screwed and welded-shut stage door. Let's hope
it's not a fire exit.
173092: You are on a landing on a fire escape. Further movement up is out of
the question since the fire escape looks pretty unstable. Beside you, to the
east, is a window.
173208: You try the fire escape and realize it would never hold your weight.
173256: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
173288: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
173320: Better use the fire escape.
173340: Better use the fire escape.
173360: Better use the fire escape.
173380: Better open the window first. Glass shards can damage the skin.
173428: You are on the west side of a metal catwalk. Beside you, mounted in the
wall, is a black, wrought-iron ladder which goes down to the backstage area.
The catwalk spans the backstage area off to the east while a window lies off to
the west.
173596: It's a long way down.
173612: It's a long way down.
173628: It's a long way down.
173644: It's a long way down.
173660: It's a long way down.
173676: It's a long way down.
173692: It's a catwalk made of steel.
173716: A catwalk is a narrow walkway usually suspended high above the ground.
173764: It's a black, wrought iron ladder.
173792: You are on the metal catwalk. The catwalk spreads off to the left and
right.
173848: It's a long way down.
173864: It's a long way down.
173880: It's a long way down.
173896: It's a long way down.
173912: It's a long way down.
173928: It's a long way down.
173944: It's a long way down.
173960: This is an extra-large cat, complete with long fangs and a twitching
tail. It reminds you of a saber-toothed tiger.
174044: A large cat lies on the catwalk, purring gently in its sleep.
174088: A terrifying large cat paces before you, snarling and spitting.
174132: The immense cat stalks you, its fangs barred. Its amber eyes have you
transfixed.
174272: The cat snarls, springs, then lands with a flashing paw on your throat,
tearing it out in one fluid motion.
174348: Sure beats me. Looks like something between a bobcat and a saber-tooth
tiger.
174404: You are on the east side of a metal catwalk. Beside you, mounted in the
wall, is a white, wrought-iron ladder which goes down to the backstage area.
The catwalk spans the backstage area off to the left.
174548: It's a long way down.
174564: It's a long way down.
174580: It's a long way down.
174596: It's a long way down.
174612: It's a long way down.
174628: It's a long way down.
174644: You are in the backstage area of the Point of View Theater. Off to the
south is a dressing room. The wall beside the doorway has a big glittering star
on it. Beside you, on the east wall, is a white ladder, securely mounted to the
wall. The stage starts up off to the west.
174840: The orchestra pit prevents you from going there.
174876: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
174908: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
174940: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
174972: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
175004: The orchestra pit prevents you from going there.
175040: It's a tacky little star, meant to inflate the tiniest of egos.
175088: Well, like all dressing rooms, this one has a star on it, and this is
that star.
175148: All you see form over the book is the image of a ball bearing about the
size of a beach ball.
175212: You're standing on the stage, facing an empty house. Off to the right,
to the east, is the backstage area, while the stage continues off to the west.
175320: The orchestra pit prevents you from going there.
175356: The orchestra pit prevents you from going there.
175392: The orchestra pit prevents you from going there.
175428: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
175460: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
175492: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
175524: You are standing at center stage.
175548: The orchestra pit prevents you from going there.
175584: The orchestra pit prevents you from going there.
175620: The orchestra pit prevents you from going there.
175656: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
175688: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
175720: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
175752: You are on the west side of the stage, peering out into the empty
seats. The stage stretches out to the east here.
175832: The orchestra pit prevents you from going there.
175868: The orchestra pit prevents you from going there.
175904: The orchestra pit prevents you from going there.
175940: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
175972: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
176004: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
176036: You are standing backstage in the Point of View Theater. The stage
stretches off to the east, while a dressing room lies off to the south. The
stage door lies directly to the west, while a black ladder goes up to a catwalk
overhead.
176198: You seem to merge with and then pass through the door!
176240: You seem to merge with and then pass through the door!
176280: As soon as you take a step, a strange man materializes before your eyes
and bars your way. "Show me your backstage pass," he demands. "Oh, you don't
have one, do you?" Before you can react, he disappears!
176428: This must be a dressing room. There's a small vanity and a casting
couch in the otherwise Spartan room. A frosted mirror is mounted to a brick
wall.
176532: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
176564: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
176596: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
176628: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
176660: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
176692: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
176724: You bump into the brick wall. Good move.
176756: It's a small table used for applying makeup.
176788: It looks a little like a paintbrush, but it's used for applying makeup.
176840: It's just an old studio-type couch.
176868: It's a pretty tacky pillow case with some writing on it.
176908: Embroidered on the pillow case is: "Viva Lost Wages."
176950: To Ginger:

I never had a more beautiful co-star.
Can't wait 'til our
paths cross and we collide!

With love,
X.
177040: This must be Fred, A Star's dressing room. There's a small vanity table
where he no doubt applies his stage makeup. The walls are plain brick, simple
decor for a star of such magnitude.
177172: It's a small table used for applying makeup.
177204: The front of the clock has no hands or numbers. Its face is a slowly
spinning galaxy--the longer you stare at it, the more entranced you become by
it. Engraved in its back is the following: "Noalarm Clock.
177352: Set for Eternity." It emits crackles and hums as if it were highly
charged with electricity.
177420: Sitting in the back of the clock is a small red key.
177460: This is a cross between an alarm clock and an energy-focuser. Energy
focusers are a Dumontian invention, the very things which blew the roof off the
Research Center the last time.
177588: In a surreal vision, you see time itself melting.
177624: The key is red aluminum, toothless, and has a rectangular shaft.
177672: Zizzzzz and pop! Mental Krispies(tm) move over! Seems your medulla is
dulla than you thought! Touching this with your bare hands sent quite a jolt
through you! Would you like to fry again?
177806: Great! Better luck last time! Zizzzzz...
177844: You reach for the key but the robe causes you to float up too high.
177892: An arc of energy jumps from the clock to the ground! Taken.
177936: You're at the southern end of a long, narrow, north/south alley beside
the theater. The alley starts up to the north here.
178024: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
178060: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
178096: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
178132: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
178168: You are floating in a strange, transparent bubble. You look down and
see your body, an immobile form stretched out on the floor below. A silvery
cord leads down from your bubble to your form, to the east, while a trail of
glistening, prismatic bubbles leads up, to the west, into a bright white light.
178380: It looks like you're fast asleep.
178404: You are standing in the middle of a round room. Before you, an
odd-looking person paints a strange painting. There is a doorway off to the
east.
178508: It looks like a clock, melting over a rock. Sticking up into the air is
a cactus, out of which grows a paint brush. Looped over the brush is a key.
178612: I don't think you can. Each time you try, your hands pass through it.
178662: Sal Dolly wears a paint-smeared smock. On closer examination you
realize she is not a real person but only a painting of herself, done by
another likeness.
178776: So, you've taken to talking to images of people now, have you? A little
too much stress, perhaps?
178848: Sal is quite a gal. She often can't imagine her image being quite so
clear as when she's working on a self-portrait.
178932: You're in a meltdown area, standing in a narrow theater alcove. The
ticket window to your right is gone, melted like the wax on a candle. The
bulletin board which was once there is replaced by ashes. The door to the
theater has been closed--a sign across it says, "Meltdown Area. Stay Away.
Steer clear. And that means you, buddy. The Brain Police." The only way out of
this area appears to be through the mist to the north.
179236: You better not. Meltdowns are messy things.
179268: No, I don't think so. Better take the northern path.
179308: You're starting to have some trouble concentrating. You better get some
rest.
179364: You think you're starting to develop a serious fever. You should get
some sleep.
179424: You're having real trouble controlling your mind and body. Nothing a
good nap couldn't cure.
179492: You're starting to melt down yourself. Lullaby and goodnight...
179540: Hey, looks like Parti pulled your plugs! See ya in the afterlife!
179592: A holographic image of him appears over the handbook. Fred looks like
an overgrown ball-bearing, a chromium, high-tech whirlwind of almost pure
energy. He's tough to pin down as he flits in and out of places with incredible
speed. He brandishes a top hat and wears a round tuxedo.
179788: A white mist envelops you in mid-stride. The floor beneath you drops
away and you feel as though you are falling through space.
179876: You are in a dark and quiet area, in what appears to be a lobby to a
rather large building. A barely-readable sign on the wall says, "Welcome to the
Planetarium." The only light here filters in from the northeast mist, making
the lobby's darkness almost palpable. The walls are painted a matte black and
seem to absorb every photon of available light, as if they were covered in
soft, plush black velvet. Off to the west the lobby vanishes into deep, inky
blackness.
180204: You thought the entrance to the Planetarium was dark, but this inner
hallway makes that feel like the bright outdoors. You can reach out and touch
the hallway walls, but that's the only way to know they're there. Before you is
an exhibit, a little pedestal, lit by a tiny light. It's labeled, "The Vacuum
of Space." To the east is the main lobby, while a sloping aisle heads down to
the west. You peer down into the darkness but can make out nothing at all.
180528: You are in the hallway for the Planetarium. Before you is an exhibit, a
little pedestal. It's labeled, "The Vacuum of Space." To the east is the main
lobby, while a sloping aisle heads down to the west.
180676: It's a pedestal which supports the vacuum exhibit.
180712: It's a small pedestal with a glass jar on it.
180796: . The splinters shred the robe into non-existence, though
180840: You smash the jar. Since there was a vacuum inside it, the air in the
room rushes in to fill the vacuum. This implosion causes the glass jar to break
into many small glass pieces. The jar then explodes, throwing many glass
slivers into your body. Alas. Much glass, no luck.
181032: at the jar, but it just grazes it before falling to the floor. (A good
thought, though. Clever.)
181104: Sitting in the glass jar is a violet key.
181136: A faint image of the jar floats above your book. The jar seems to be
covered by something, though, which obscures your view of it.
181228: This key has a circular shaft.
181252: Ouch! That glass is sharp! Leave it be.
181284: You are in the seating area for the planetarium, standing beneath the
outer edge of the huge domed ceiling. Down the aisle, to the west, sits a huge
projector used to make points of light on the pitch-black ceiling. There are
more seats off to the northwest and southwest.
181472: From this distance, all you can tell is that it looks like two spheres
connected by a center tube.
181540: The dome is a deep inky black, like the night sky itself.
181580: A small rectangular patch seems to be missing.
181616: You're too far away from it to do much of anything with it.
181660: You are in the seating area for the planetarium, north of the huge
projector. There's more seating off to the southeast and southwest.
181756: You are in the seating area for the planetarium, west of the huge
projector. There's more seating off to the northeast and the southeast. An
almost invisible ladder, its rungs painted matte black, leads up the wall here,
heading into a hidden room.
181932: The ladder has sixteen rungs made of metal. Don't ask how I know
that--I just do.
181992: You are in the seating area for the planetarium, south of the huge
projector. There's more seating off to the northeast and the northwest.
182088: You are in the control booth for the planetarium. Before you, through a
slit in the dome, you can see the entire area below. There are two buttons
mounted on the control board--one of them white, the other one black. The
ladder leads down to the main seating area.
182276: The control board is nothing more than a long piece of metal with two
buttons on it. A small plaque is mounted to it, though.
182470: I computer hasn't a clue.
182492: The plaque reads, "Manufactured by Brainwave Creations(tm), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Cascade Mountain Publishing."
182584: The lights go out in the planetarium.
182612: The lights go on in the planetarium.
182640: You press the black button, but alas, nothing happens.
182680: Pressed. The projector comes to life, filling the black dome with a
myriad of diamond points, stars glistening and twinkling in a deep night sky.
The laser starts making a strange high-pitched noise and starts outlining a
rectangle on the ceiling. It traces the path hundreds of thousands of times in
a few seconds until, somehow, a piece of the "sky" starts to float down into
the room below. The further down it floats, the more it resembles a black piece
of cloth about the size of a blanket.
183024: You are in the center of the seating area, standing before a huge
monstrosity of complicated machinery, a star projector. With its modular
construction, it looks like something out of a science fiction film. Seating is
easily available to the north, south, east and west.
183212: There is a huge projector permanently mounted on the floor.
183256: The projector seems to be lacking one of its major components.
183300: The laser is mounted in the projector making it operational.
183344: The projector looks like two globes connected by a tube. Holes dot the
surface to let light through and create the star patterns on the ceiling.
183444: A major component seems to be missing from its center portion.
183488: Mounted to the projector is a laser.
183552: This is a projector used to create images of the night sky on the
overhead dome.
183608: Well, for one thing, it's missing.
183636: The laser is correctly inserted into the projector.
183672: The tube creates a bridge which connects the two spheres.
183712: A major component seems to be missing from it.
183744: You close your eyes and see a deep summer sky, studded with millions of
tiny points of light.
183808: It's a black piece of soft, light-absorbing cloth. Having it near you
makes you feel safe, secure and sleepy.
183888: An image of yourself as a small child nestled and sleeping beneath a
dark velvety blanket appears before you.
183964: A white mist envelops you in mid-stride. The floor beneath you drops
away and you feel as though you are falling through space.
184052: You're at the northern edge of a small pond. A light mist dances over
the surface of the clear pond, touching down then swirling up in a dance played
out on the soft breeze. A grassy path runs along the pond's edge to the
southwest and the southeast.
184228: Watch out. You ain't no ducky.
184252: Like a curious puppy, the duck starts rooting around in the cattails.
All of a sudden it starts quacking its little beak off, pointing to something
with its wing.
184364: You wade a few steps into the water when Professor Parti *poofs* into
existence beside you. "You have a permit for swimming here, I take it? No? I
didn't think so." And with a wave of his hands you find yourself back on dry
land.
184532: Lying at the bottom of the crystal clear pond is a bright green key.
184580: in the pond, and decide against it. After all, you don't want to
pollute.
184636: Let's not pollute what's natural, eh?
184664: Let's see, how should I approach this? It's a small body of water? It's
just a pond.
184728: The vision of an animal, too fuzzy to make out clearly, appears
floating above the book. The creature seems to be feeding on the bottom of the
pond.
184832: Its shaft is in the shape of a square.
184860: The duck quacks then leaps into the pond. She paddles around for a few
seconds, then dives down deep, coming up with the key in her bill. She swims to
the shoreline and drops the key at your feet, panting as only a duck can pant.
185020: It's under water, in case you haven't noticed.
185056: You're at the western edge of a small pond. A light mist dances over
the surface of the clear pond, touching down then swirling up in a dance played
out on the soft breeze. A grassy path runs along the pond's edge to the
northeast and the southeast. A narrow path through a park area starts up to the
west here, while an entrance to a golf course can be spotted to the southwest.
A small clearing is off to the northwest.
185348: Watch out. You ain't no ducky.
185372: You wade a few steps into the water when Professor Parti *poofs* into
existence beside you. "You have a permit for swimming here, I take it? No? I
didn't think so." And with a wave of his hands you find yourself back on dry
land.
185540: You're at the southern edge of a small pond. A light mist dances over
the surface of the clear pond, touching down then swirling up in a dance played
out on the soft breeze. A grassy path runs along the pond's edge to the
northwest and the northeast.
185716: Watch out. You ain't no ducky.
185740: You wade a few steps into the water when Professor Parti *poofs* into
existence beside you. "You have a permit for swimming here, I take it? No? I
didn't think so." And with a wave of his hands you find yourself back on dry
land.
185908: You're at the eastern edge of a small pond. A light mist dances over
the surface of the clear pond, touching down then swirling up in a dance played
out on the soft breeze. A grassy path runs along the pond's edge to the
northwest and the southwest. The path to the east dissolves into mist.
186112: Watch out. You ain't no ducky.
186136: You wade a few steps into the water when Professor Parti *poofs* into
existence beside you. "You have a permit for swimming here, I take it? No? I
didn't think so." And with a wave of his hands you find yourself back on dry
land.
186304: The duck sees you approach and quacks wildly, waddling toward you.
186352: You are on a little narrow path which winds through a pretty park area.
A small clearing sits off to the north, while a petting zoo can be seen off to
the northwest. To the south is the entrance to a golf course. Off to the east
you can see a little duck pond. The path continues to the west.
186556: You are standing on a deserted street that reminds you of a
neighborhood you lived in as a child. On a lawn sits a purple cardboard dog.
Beside it sits a cardboard cut-out of a small child who looks like Dr. Dumont
must have looked at the age of seven. A narrow pathway starts up to the east.
To the north is the entrance to a petting zoo.
186792: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
186828: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
186864: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
186900: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
186936: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
186972: It's a piece of cardboard cut into the shape of a small boy. It looks
like what you imagine Dr. Dumont looked like as a small boy.
187064: It's a piece of cardboard cut into the shape of a small dog. It looks
like what you imagine Dr. Dumont's dog looked like when he was a small boy.
187225: Good move.
187272: You are standing in an abandoned petting zoo. There are several empty
nests here for nesting animals and corrals for corralling animals. Off to the
south is a street, while a clearing lies off to the east.
187416: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
187452: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
187488: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
187524: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
187560: The eider duck sees a nest and waddles over to it. It starts pulling
out its down feathers to feather its nest, making it comfortable. (Now you know
where the phrase "Feathering one's nest" comes from. Glad to have helped.)
187720: They're here expressly for the animals.
187748: They're just nests. Nothing more.
187776: These are fences arranged to make it hard for the animals to escape the
incessant attention of little children.
187852: Petting zoos are where parents take their offspring to meet and torture
half-starved wildlife. With the child carrying a bag of feed, the animals
usually take an unusually large interest in the child, scaring it half to
death. Usual sounds in the petting zoo, beside the munching and grinding of
food between the animals' jaws, include children's screams of panic as an
animal approaches for a handout.
188132: You are near a big oak tree in the middle of a small grassy clearing. A
pond is off to the east, while a narrow pathway travels along to the south. Off
to the west is a small petting zoo.
188264: A thicket of shrubs and trees block your way.
188296: A thicket of shrubs and trees block your way.
188328: A thicket of shrubs and trees block your way.
188360: Dense bushes block your way.
188380: Gnarly. Oaky. Woody.
188400: Don't bother. There's nothing up there.
188432: Now, isn't that sweet? I've heard of tree-lovers, but isn't this taking
that a little too far?
188504: Dangling from the tree is a large pinata in the shape of a sphere.
188552: It's a large and colorful sphere.
188576: Parti, dressed as a forest ranger, materializes before you.
188620: "Fore you go hittin' any wildlife, you best show me somethin' that says
you're allowed to hit 'em," Parti says.
188704: You smash the pinata with the golf club and it breaks apart. From its
interior spill out thousands of tiny ducks, each wearing a Groucho mask. All
but one little quacker quickly and noisily take to flight.
188848: Parti appears in a puff of violet smoke. He smashes the pinata with a
golf club, then disappears. The pinata breaks apart and from its interior spill
out thousands of tiny ducks, each wearing a Groucho mask. They all take flight
but one little quacker.
189024: Parti gets tired of waiting around. A golf club appears in his hand and
he smashes the pinata to pieces before your eyes. The pinata breaks apart and
from its interior spill out thousands of tiny ducks, each wearing a Groucho
mask. They all take flight but one little quacker. He then vanishes in a poof
of smoke.
189244: Pinatas (pronounced pin-ya-tas) are typically filled with sweets and
little toys, and are hung from trees. A child is then tortured by being
blind-folded and rotated in a clockwise direction until he can barely stand.
The adults nearby chuckle at the child's discomfort. The child the swings
wildly, typically with a stick, hoping to burst the pinata and thus get lots of
goodies. If he manages to break apart the pinata, all the nearby children rush
in and get the "best stuff." So what the child who hits the pinata gets is
usually frustration by the boatload.
189636: You are north of a miniature golf course. To the northeast you see a
thicket of cattails waving in the wind. To the northwest you spy a street. The
golf course is off to the south.
189764: Dense bushes block your way.
189784: Dense bushes block your way.
189804: Dense bushes block your way.
189824: Dense bushes block your way.
189844: Parti *POOFS* into existence before you in a puff of salmon-colored
smoke. "Say, there, that memento is for players only." And with that, he takes
the club and replaces it in the rack. Needless to say, he disappears in the
same manner in which he appeared.
190032: They're cattails. What more can I say?
190064: These weeds often grow wild along the shores of lakes and ponds.
190108: They're pussywillows. What more can I say?
190140: These weeds often grow wild along the shores of lakes and ponds.
190184: Before you stretches out four holes of miniature golf; torturous,
boring, yet compelling, complete with a windmill, little bridge, Hydra and
lighthouse. The path to the north leads back to the entrance, while a
shimmering mist obscures the way to the south. Standing by your side is a rack
designed to hold miniature golf clubs.
190416: You can't get through the wall of shimmering mist.
190484: The hole has a large windmill whose blades turn slowly, obscuring the
path to the hole about half of the time. As you examine the hole carefully,
bending down, you can see that it's pretty much a straight shot.
190632: As you stand up, a golf ball magically *POOFS* into view on the little
rubber tee.
190700: This hole has a large Hydra whose heads branch off, each one extending
out over a separate hole. Since there are no rules posted, it's impossible to
tell if you're supposed to get the ball into one hole or all the holes at the
same time.
190864: When you glance down, a golf ball magically *POOFS* into view on the
little rubber tee.
190932: The lighthouse towers over the tiny hole. It would seem to be an easy
shot, but every few seconds, the lighthouse beacon spins around madly, blinding
you for an instant.
191052: When you look down to avoid the glaring light, you spot a small golf
ball, sitting on a rubber tee.
191124: This hole has two water hazards, both of which are spanned by a
complex, interwoven network of bridges. The water hazards, however, have dried
up. You trace the path a ball might take with your eyes, winding its way
through the bridges, avoiding the empty water hazards, only to drop down into
the hole.
191336: As you look back at the tee, you notice a golf ball has appeared there.
191388: It's a little rubber tee. Printed on it's side is the following: "I am
a rubber tee. Tee hee."
191460: It has more dimples than Shirley Temple.
191492: As soon as you reach for it, it seems to sense your intentions and
immediately *POOFS* into non-existence.
191574: The Windmill Hole: A Lesson in Humanity.
You strike the ball and it
careens wildly off the sideboards, and heads right for the rotating windmill
blade. Fortunately for you, the ball screeches to a stop right before hitting
it, waiting for the blade's rotation to clear the path. Once accomplished, the
ball turns back, looking over its "shoulder" and winks at you. It then scurries
onto the path, under the windmill, and falls directly into the hole. Though a
little stunned by your great stroke of luck, you think to recover the ball.
Unfortunately, it vanished as mysteriously as it appeared.
191996: The Little Bridge: A Lesson in Humidity.
You strike the ball firmly,
imparting enough acceleration to the ball to launch it into orbit. Thankfully,
the ball puts on its brakes and slows itself down. You watch it make its
winding way to the hole where it eventually drops in, *POOFING* out of
existence.
192220: The Lighthouse: A Lesson in Humility.
The ball, nicely struck by you,
decides to take matters into its own... er... hands and turns around.
"Now,
just what do you think you're doing? How would you like it if I struck you?" it
asks. It hitches up its... well... pants, sort of, and then, glaring at you,
*POOFS* out of existence.
192476: The Hydra: A Lesson in Division.
You strike the ball with what seems
like a reasonable amount of force. The ball travels up a ramp to the top where
the ramps split into three, each one heading for a different head. At that
instant, the ball splits into three smaller balls, each one heading for its own
separate head. The balls then fall into their respective holes and disappear
with a *POOF*.

"Nicely done," a voice in your head intones. "Three holes in
one."
192812: Etched onto the club's handle, in fine scrollwork, is the name of the
club: "Smashie Mashie Model 1.01A/Wr11(tm). A Brainwave Creation."
192920: A small book lies nestled among the cattails and pussy willows.
192964: There is a picture of a curled up sleeping cat on its cover. The title
of the book is: "Bedtime for Kitty."
193044: You don't want to rouse it, now, do you? Remember the old adage: "Let
sleeping cats lie."
193112: You read the story to the cat. It purrs and curls up at your feet,
gently falling asleep.
193176: You read the story. It's a tough story to grasp since it's written in
catscript.
193236: You open the book, glance at it, then close it again.
193276: It's a book with pawprints on the cover, with inscrutable script
inside.
193328: This little lady is an eiderduck, wearing a Groucho mask. Looking at
her brings back a long forgotten memory of when your dad brought home a box
filled with little quacking ducks as a surprise for you. Needless to say, while
you greatly enjoyed playing with the box of ducks, your mother had a few choice
words for your father.
193556: You pet the duck and could swear you hear it purring. But you know
that's impossible.
193616: It quickly waddles away, out of your reach.
193648: Be kind to your web-footed friends.
193676: The quacking sounds like "Momma, momma."
193716: uackle? Mackle spackle. Le quacker!
193744: "Quack," she says.
193760: "Quack quack," she says.
193780: "Quackle-de-quackle," she says.
193808: She looks at you with a puzzled look on her face. "Quack?" she asks.
193860: "Quack, quack, quack," she quacks.
193888: The duck quacks a teary-eyed farewell.
193916: The duck waddles along, quacking to some duck top-40 number.
193960: The duck bobs along, snapping her pin-feathers to some ducktune she
hums.
194012: The duck quacks the lyrics to "Boogie Bayou" as she duck-walks along.
194064: The duck waddles and bops to some quacked-up humming.
194104: The eiderduck is long known for its soft, downy feathers. People the
world over (okay, maybe not all over the world) seek out pillows filled with
its feathers.
194216: You see the duck diving into the pond.
194244: They're soft as duck down. Which is convenient, since that's what they
are.
194300: There are far too many feathers to carry in your hands. The feathers
fall between your fingers, drifting back down in a soft, rocking arc.
194396: You better open the pillowcase first so you'll have some way of
carrying them.
194452: There are far too many feathers to carry in your hands. The feathers
fall between your fingers, drifting back down in a soft, rocking arc.
194548: They're already in the pillowcase.
194576: A white mist envelops you in mid-stride. The floor beneath you drops
away and you feel as though you are falling through space.
194664: You are standing beneath a huge banner. Odd carnival music drifts
through the air, putting you in a festive mood. The path to the west leads into
the fairgrounds, and beside this path stands a small booth. The path to the
southeast seems to melt into an area of thick, swirling mist.
194860: Barker looks you over and smiles.
194884: "I see you got some milk to drink before you sleep," he says.
194930: "Too bad it's so cold. No one could drink this and fall asleep."
194982: "Too bad it's still chilled. Not at all warm enough for a bedtime
drink."
195040: "It's perfectly warmed! Here!" Barker removes the key from the ribbon
and gives the key to you.
195112: "Too bad it's scalded! No one could drink that."
195150: "Too bad there's not enough to make it worth drinking."
195194: "Nice to see you again," he says.
195224: Around his neck is a ribbon with a blue key dangling from it. The
ribbon says, "Milky Way Title Holder."
195302: Barker is a stocky guy in his bib overalls and straw hat. You half
expect a piece of straw to be dangling from his mouth.
195392: "You've got to earn that," Barker says.
195424: "You've got to earn that," Barker says.
195456: "It's a fun place to hang out. Then again, so is anyplace. Fun to hang
out, I mean."
195520: "Well, I know I've been entrusted with it, and that anyone who earns it
can have it."
195584: "And a wonderful time was had by all whose stomachs could handle it,"
he says.
195640: "Nothing like it," he says. "I like a few sips of it before
nighty-night time."
195700: "I know next to nothing about that." He looks around to see if someone
is listening. "But I hear Fred, A Star, is making an appearance. But not here."
195812: "I try to be unfair," he says, "or fair. Depending on the weather."
195864: "You here for the UnFair? Well, you look like you're in the mood for a
good time, anyway," he says.
195940: "Well, I'm stuck in here while you get to explore and roam around," he
says.
195996: "A natural-born huckster if I ever saw one," he says.
196036: "Great prize, if you ask me. Which you just did."
196106: with caramel added. What a marketing ploy!"
196140: "You know, we were going to add machines in there, but we ran out of
virtual objects."
196204: "Nothing like it to whip up one's energy levels," he says, winking.
196256: "It's had it's ups and downs, but we know how to take the heat."
196304: "Every time I ride in one of those things, the collisions get me hot
under the collar."
196368: "The quiz? What do you need to know, the answers? If I told you, they'd
smash me into particles."
196444: "That's a fun thing to do. And you're bound to win a prize," he says.
196496: "Don't ask. He's got cows on the brain. We tried talking to him about
it but he just kept chewing and looking at us with those huge eyes of his. Sad,
really."
196612: "This is an unfair," he says, "so I'm tryin' to play fair. So, in all
fairness, I gotta say I don't know much about that."
196708: Barker is your gateway in and out of the unfair grounds, a man who
carefully monitors people who arrive and leave. He has been entrusted with the
blue key and has been instructed to present it to the first person showing
himself worthy.
196872: Its shaft is in the shape of a diamond.
196900: It's a piece of blue ribbon.
196924: It reads "Welcome to the Agricultural UnFair, where all's fair except
love and war."
196988: You're at the eastern edge of a midway which seems oddly deserted,
especially considering the noise and lights. Circus and calliope music drift
down the midway from the west, caught on a balmy breeze from some forgotten
childhood day. The smell of cotton candy is in the air, as well as roasted
peanuts. Off to the east is the exit from the unfairgrounds. To the north is an
arcade, while a booth lies off to the south.
197280: You hear the gay sounds of a calliope.
197308: This is the ring toss booth, known far and wide for being a push-over.
Everyone who plays a game of ring toss seems to win something. The game is
manned by a gentleman who wears a name plaque which reads "John Boothe". Off to
the north is the midway.
197484: "Hey, wait a minute! I need that," Boothe says, pointing to the
ring.
You smile and say, "Oops. Sorry," then toss it on the counter.
197588: "Wait a minute there, partner," Mr. Boothe says. "You gotta win to get
one."
197648: Parti materializes in a puff of orange smoke. "Er... that water is for
the wildlife. Best leave it alone," he says, then immediately vanishes.
197752: You think better of it since the water looks a little dirty.
197796: It's a large mug with cows painted on it. Its interior is lined with a
thermos-type liner.
197860: This is a prize for accomplishing the ringtoss.
197896: It seems like the perfect thing for holding warm or cold liquids.
197944: It looks like a kewpie doll, but it's in the shape of a cow.
197988: This is a prize for accomplishing the ringtoss.
198024: An image of a road-side cafe pops into your mind. You wish it hadn't.
You got a case of food poisoning there.
198104: The vase is a stylized replica of a cow's head.
198140: This is a prize for accomplishing the ringtoss.
198176: A holographic image of the vase filled with flowers appears, floating
above the book.
198236: They're painted salt and pepper shakers.
198268: This is a prize for accomplishing the ringtoss.
198304: Nothing spicy comes to mind. Hot-cha-cha.
198336: You turn it on, but nothing much happens.
198368: Sure. Since nothing was happening with it anyway, consider it off.
198416: It's a lamp in the shape of a cow's head.
198448: This is a prize for accomplishing the ringtoss.
198484: Nothing enlightening comes to mind.
198512: It's a large ring, like a hoop, you use in a ringtoss game.
198556: You casually toss the hoop toward a prize post but as it leaves your
fingers, it seems to come to life. It does a mid-air spin, gets caught in a
dynamic updraft, bounces off the ceiling, off the floor, then one of the side
walls, and finally stops, perfectly centered over the prize post! "I seen it
all, now," Boothe says. "You just earned any prize from the shelf."
198816: He's a slim little guy with hazel eyes. An actor if I ever saw one.
198868: "What do you want me to say? That this ring represents the circle of
particle acceleration? The circle of life? Well, I won't. So there." He sticks
his tongue out at you.
198996: "Well," he says, smiling, "we don't have tickets here, but you might be
able to present something that shows that you're entitled to the privileges to
which you're entitled."
199124: "I thought I asked you not to ask about nothing?"
199160: "I'm just here to man the booth."
199188: "We've never met before, have we? I don't think so."
199232: "Why, you're not talking about the ring toss, are you? It's not rigged
too much, is it?" He looks at you questioningly, then smiles. "You must be
talking about the whole Aggie UnFair, eh? Fun, isn't it? If you haven't already
been, you should try some of the rides. And take the Milky Way Quiz if you
haven't. It's tough, though."
199480: "Well, it was built a few nanoseconds ago. When you leave it'll be
deconstructed. Of course, when you return, it'll be reconstructed. Keeps the
circuits busy, you know."
199604: "Better win something to put them in," he says.
199640: "What's to say? A perfect nighttime drink. (Personally, I prefer diet
root beer.)"
199704: "You should really think about that. You don't want me to spoil your
fun by telling you my favorite prize, now, do you? I thought not."
199804: "Why, it's simple as simple can be. You just throw the ring and hope
for the best," he says.
199872: "I just man the ring toss booth. Don't ask me nothin'."
199916: "I already punched it," Mr. Boothe says.
199948: John Boothe takes your card, punches a tiny hole in it, then returns it
to you.
200004: John Boothe is the manager of the ringtoss booth, a man of
unquestionable inner balance. Not easily surprised by most things, he knows a
winner when he sees one.
200116: You're in the Dollar Arcade. (Nothing costs a penny anymore, so what's
the point?) All around you are arcade machines, or at least the images of them.
As you glance around the place, you realize all the fixtures and equipment are
simply a part of your memories of a similar place you were in as a child. The
midway lies off to the south.
200356: Looks like they're not really here. Still, if they were here, you would
have had a great time.
200424: You've reached the westernmost edge of the midway, the place where
things seem to be faster and more frenetic. There's a taste of desperation in
the air as the rides in this area are more violent, noisier and dangerous. To
the south, standing high overhead, is a shaky structure, a roller coaster built
of wood. To the north is a more modern ride, The Whip, which seems to do just
that to the cars at the end of it's arms.
200720: You're at the westernmost edge of the midway. The unfairgrounds stop
here.
200776: You are standing on a little platform. Before you, to the north, is a
ride which looks rather frightening--people and faces whiz by so quickly
they're little more than a blur. The midway is off to the south. Beyond that,
towering overhead, further to the south, you can see the top of the gigantic
roller coaster.
200996: If you want to enter the ride, just say so.
201028: The Whip is a bunch of seats suspended around a central axis. Clearly,
the idea of this ride is to generate a lot of acceleration and centrifugal
force.
201148: You climb into one of the cars and hang on for dear life. Your body is
pinned to the left wall and then the right wall of the little car by
centrifugal force. By the end of the ride, you feel like you've trained for a
NASA mission! You feel pretty hot under the collar.
201344: You're standing by the clanking mechanism of a roller coaster, right
outside the cars which sit to the south. A sign says, "Enter Ride. Have ticket
ready." That's all very interesting, but you wonder if taking such a dangerous
ride is good idea. Wooden coasters are, at best, wobbly and scary.
201556: If you want to enter the ride, say so.
201584: The sign reads, "Enter Ride. Have ticket ready. Then say bye-bye to
your cool demeanor."
201652: Looking at a roller coaster never properly conveys anything of the
experience. It "looks" about as scary as you could ever hope.
201756: You enter the roller coaster and hang on tight! The car you're in is
pulled up the long first hill, then plunges headlong down the other side. Your
stomach remains at the top, however, and eventually catches up with you three
hills later. While that's nice of it, you think it might have been better if it
had stayed at the top of the first hill. You start to regret having taken this
ride. By the time it's over, you've broken into a sweat and sworn off them
forever.
202092: You are standing before a booth manned by the great Kon Karni. A
curtain of pearlized beads hangs down, fringing the booth's front window.
Inside the booth an opalescent paper lines the walls giving the place a pearly
white glow. A sign overhead reads, "Karni's Korner. Overseen by the Milky Way
Bureau of Weights and Measures." To the north lies the midway.
202350: "You look like a semi-intelligent person," Karni says.  "Don't just
stand there with your mouth agape--take the quiz! If you get all the questions
right, you get a prize!"
202480: "I see you're back! For your knowledge, here's your reward!" Karni
says. He places four frozen cubes of milk on the edge of the booth.
202580: "Welcome back!" Karni says. "How about finding something to put your
prize in?"
202644: The sign reads, "Karni's Korner. Overseen by the Milky Way Bureau of
Weights and Measures."
202716: "One to a customer. Moo-ve along." he says.
202752: "You've passed! You milked that for all it was worth! For your
knowledge, here's a reward!" Karni says. He places four frozen cubes of milk on
the edge of the booth.
202872: "You've passed! You milked that for all it was worth! For your
knowledge, there's a reward!" Karni says. He holds four frozen cubes of milk in
his hand. "But I'll hold onto them for you since they'll quickly melt."
203032: "Your answers moo-ved me but not enough to pass. Better luck next
time," Karni says.
203094: Karni cuts a magnificent figure in his turban and flowing robes.
Stitched to the left breast of his robe is a tiny cloth figure of a cow.
203192: "Well, I strike a fine figure, eat a strict diet of cheeses, yogurt
and, of course, steak."
203260: "You're here to take the quiz, aren't you? You look like you are."
203312: "It curdles my mind, the whey these questions are whipped at me."
203360: "I'm glad you asked about that. My apparel is apparent. What more can I
say that I haven't already said?"
203440: "You moo-ve me with your question," he says. "Since we don't sell
tickets at the unfair, you must re-moo-ve any barriers by showing me something
which indicates to what you're entitled."
203576: "See, the whole thing, skimming off the top, you understand, isn't
worth talking about," he says, grinning maniacally.
203664: "I already punched it," Kon Karni says.
203696: Kon Karni takes your card, punches a tiny hole in it, then returns it
to you.
203752: Karni is obsessed with, well, cows, in case you haven't already
noticed. His wife left him after a bitter fight over the last pat of butter. He
takes his coffee light, with no sugar, and his bedtime ritual includes a nice
glass of warm milk.
203924: The cubes are frozen cubes of milk.
203952: You take the cubes but they quickly melt in your hands.
204044: Done. The milk quickly disappears, though.
204076: Just having the milk is comfort enough.
204104: It's not something you can take unless you have webbed fingers.
204148: The cubes have melted into a milk puddle.
204180: You're midway down the midway, between the calmer booths of the east
and the more frenetic activities and rides to the west. Before you, to the
north, is the entrance to the Bumper Car ride. To the south is a booth called
Karni's Korner.
204348: You are standing behind a turnstile, watching the bumper cars. A
whirring of motion, barely visible except from the corner of your eye, catches
your attention. A small sign beckons you to enter the ride.
204492: If you want to enter a car, say so.
204520: The sign reads, "Don't be cool, warm up on the best ride in town!"
204572: They're just cars you get into and drive around, bumping into the other
cars in the ride.
204648: You enter a car and then suddenly all the other cars are filled. The
faster your car goes, the more collisions you seem to get into. The more cars
your car hits, the further your car seems to bounce. Some fun, eh? As soon as
you leave the ride, you feel rather flushed.
204844: The sign reads, "Enter ride. Have ticket ready."
204884: This is sign. I mean, it's not that tough. Have you examined it?
204932: "Show me something entitling you to a freebie, first,"
204972: The ride attendant looks at your card, smiles, punches it, then returns
it to you.
205060: Is the Milky Way 3.7 parsecs from Earth?
205092: Is a 3 Musketeers a Milky Way without caramel?
205128: Is the Milky Way a galaxy containing almost 100 thousand stars?
205176: Is our solar system near the center of the Milky Way?
205216: Is "Cow Tao" another way of saying "milky way"?
205256: Does the Milky Way have at least 10,000 galaxies?
205356: Good question.
205368: Didn't you listen to Dr. Dumont at all?
205400: That's not going to get you a good grade, you know.
205600: It does this so your mind can help it understand how to view Particle
X.
205652: You're trying to find and observe Particle X.
205688: Typing "SCORE" might give you some interesting hints.
205732: If you have explored around a bit, that is.
205764: Obviously, you need some keys...
205832: Explore around a bit. The meaning will become quite clear.
205876: Have you been to the School of Thought yet?
205908: Have you been to the Exam Room yet?
205936: Have you examined the desk there?
205960: Have you tried to take the exam?
205984: By finding the five keys, you will have found the answers to the five
koans.
206040: If you really need to know where all the keys are, look in the "As a
last resort" section of the hints.
206116: You need those elements to "prepare yourself for shutdown."
206160: Now what could that mean?
206180: Listen to Dr. Dumont carefully...
206264: "The human can go home and get some sleep!"
206296: You'll need five elements that help you go to sleep.
206336: If you really need to know what or where they are, look in the "As a
last resort" section of the hints.
206412: There are five power plants strewn across the metaphorical landscape.
206460: They, too, are very metaphorical.
206488: So metaphorical, in fact, that they don't even exist.
206528: Are you beginning to suspect something?
206556: You're right...
206636: The Brain Police, founded in 1967, are notorious for a high level of
paranoia.
206696: When you do something you should not, or rather, "think" something you
should not, the Brain Police make their appearance.
206884: Just do not annoy them.
206904: That's not entirely true.
206924: Some things are very definitely real.
207008: However, its neural network has a limited capacity.
207099: Good move.
207144: Be sure to pick them up.
207164: They're rather dirty, aren't they?
207192: You might want to get them clean before wearing them, though.
207236: There are two possibilities.
207256: Every good apartment has a bathroom...
207336: Oh, you're locked out of the apartment?
207368: Don't despair, all is not lost.
207392: Where else could you get your jeans clean?
207424: In the Science Art Museum, perhaps?
207496: Have you tried...
207552: You can't open the window.
207572: Don't worry, you'll get in again when you need to.
207612: Go on playing the game.
207632: Unless you've forgotten to take the pair of jeans with you.
207676: In which case you will have to RESTORE, RESTART or UNDO.
207728: You can put objects on the range and heat them.
207764: Or burn them, in certain cases.
207788: You'll know when to use it later.
207812: There is nothing to see here. Keep going.
207844: The fog is like a tunnel that leads in two directions.
207884: One is the direction you came from...
207956: It's the equivalent of the machine you entered in Professor Dumont's
Research Zone.
208020: In other words, the P.A.R.T.I.
208048: That's "Particle Accelerator and Reality Translation Integrator," in
case you weren't paying attention to Dumont earlier.
208140: You weren't? Shame on you.
208164: In any case, using it is not a good idea.
208196: You do want those, yes.
208216: However, that's not as easy as it seems.
208248: Trying to take them springs them up out of your reach.
208288: You need to find something that lets you reach the ceiling.
208332: You can find that "something" in the School of Thought.
208376: The floating robe.
208392: WEAR ROBE when you are in the lab to float to the ceiling.
208440: One pair of wires, ready for taking.
208468: There is.
208476: But the teacher will not arrive until a bit later.
208512: Ask the game.
208524: Ask him.
208532: He is a valuable source of information throughout the game.
208576: He will also pop up and help (or annoy) you in various other locations.
208628: But what's most important is that he's carrying the Diploma of Thought.
208680: You'll need to pass the exam to get it.
208708: You will need to pass an exam to get the Diploma of Thought from Parti.
208760: SIT AT DESK to start the exam.
208788: Follow the instructions.
208808: You'll need to wear a clean pair of jeans to continue.
208848: See the previous hint section to find out where to get that.
208892: Once you have a clean pair of jeans, PUT HANDS ON VIEWSCREEN to
continue.
208956: Again, follow the instructions.
208980: Read through all the koans.
209000: By putting a key into its slot and turning it.
209032: You'll need to find five keys.
209056: That is, in fact, one major goal of the game.
209092: When you've turned all five keys, you pass the exam.
209132: Koans are Zen story-paradox-riddle-jokes.
209164: You'll need it in various places. Check for hints there.
209208: Meditate.
209216: Sit on the mat.
209228: Aha!
209232: By the way, it's yours for taking.
209260: Ask the game.
209272: That is the way of Zen.
209292: It also saves a lot of coding.
209316: You need something else to channel your thoughts.
209352: Something which is also in the School of Thought.
209388: The handbook from Philosophy.
209412: Once you have that, consult your manual about how to meditate properly.
209464: Chat a little.
209476: Isn't that an interesting handbook Chaos Cohen is carrying?
209520: I think you might want to have it.
209544: Ask the game.
209556: ASK COHEN FOR HANDBOOK.
209588: Answer his question, and it's yours.
209616: Don't know what to answer?
209636: Make something up.
209652: Just say anything. It will work.
209676: Have you examined it?
209692: You can wear it.
209704: You need it to channel your thoughts.
209732: Wear it while meditating.
209752: Consult your manual to see how.
209776: It's a little empty, isn't it?
209800: Maybe read a little while you're waiting for Dr. Gravity?
209844: The board, for example?
209864: Aha!
209868: Ask the game.
209880: You could have guessed that by now.
209908: Maybe you don't want it hard enough.
209936: You must concentrate all your thoughts on the robe.
209972: You could try meditating about it.
209996: Consult your manual about this.
210020: Don't stay too long.
210036: You can only stay for a few turns.
210060: Long enough to do what you need to do, though.
210096: A figment of your imagination?
210120: Be quicker than him!
210136: HIT GEORDI WITH TWO-BY-FOUR.
210172: TIE GEORDI TO CORE.
210196: EJECT CORE INTO SPACE.
210224: Oh, COME ON. You're not scaring me.
210256: It has something to do with how you got here.
210288: Reactor leak? Mutant atomic rats? Nuclear? Geordi?
210328: What game are you playing?
210380: You should have one in the feelies that came with the game.
210424: Don't have one? Then go buy the game!
210452: You race against a kite. Whoever is faster, wins.
210488: All you need to know is on the back of the flyer.
210524: Just follow the instructions.
210548: If you don't have the flyer, go buy the game!
210584: What are these strange numbers?
210640: You might want to follow the numbers in that order.
210676: The numbers show the path you need to take to win the kite race.
210720: Read them like a map.
210736: For example, if 2 is southeast of 1, you go SE.
210776: Follow the path from 0 through 6, then return to Gravity.
210820: Get your prize! What are you waiting for?
210852: Have you meditated about it?
210872: The fourth koan may be of some help in understanding.
210936: Who in the vicinity has glasses you could wear?
210972: You need to get Dr. Gravity's glasses.
211004: By winning the Kite Race.
211024: In the pyramid, WEAR GLASSES to be able to get the bear.
211088: Aha!
211092: There's a key attached to it, by the way.
211124: You'll need that key for the exam.
211152: A lot.
211160: Look around a bit, then read the specific questions.
211200: It's perfect for blowing bubbles with.
211228: Let's see... sudsy water. Soap film bubbles. Perhaps useful for
something?
211284: It's perfect for cleaning those dirty jeans.
211316: It's written on the glass plate in S.A.M. NE.
211356: Of course, you need to make it visible.
211384: The password is randomly generated with each new game.
211424: See the hints about the generator and the glass plate.
211464: Have you examined it?
211480: Have you broken it? I hope not.
211521: Good move.
211580: Looks like you can attach wires to the slab.
211612: Those wires, when supplied with current, form a pattern that tells you
the password for the terminal in S.A.M. North.
211700: Wires that lead, say, to a generator?
211728: Of course, the generator needs to be running.
211760: See the next question for more hints.
211788: Examine your surroundings carefully.
211816: There's a pipe.
211828: Its opening is right above the waterwheel...
211900: Get some water flowing so the waterwheel turns.
211936: See the next question for more hints.
211964: Be brave. Open it and find out.
211988: Oops. Hope you did a SAVE first.
212016: Examine the dial to see how much water is in there.
212052: You need to get some water out of there before you can safely open the
door.
212104: Have you been outside the entire museum?
212132: Take a walk along the path.
212152: There's a faucet! What might it do?
212180: OPEN FAUCET.
212196: The chamber will now empty slowly as the water feeds the sprinkler
system.
212248: What do piranhas like?
212264: Blood.
212272: In this case, your blood.
212292: BREAK GLASS SLAB.
212316: GET SHARD.
212332: CUT HAND WITH SHARD.
212360: HOLD HAND OVER PIRANHAS.
212392: Then, when they're all fighting among each other...
212432: THROW TOASTER IN AQUARIUM.
212468: Too bad the toaster has a fuse built in.
212496: GET TOASTER. OPEN IT.
212524: REMOVE FUSE WITH PLIERS. DRY TOASTER.
212572: CLOSE TOASTER. TURN MAIN SWITCH ON.
212648: There! The piranhas are toast!
212672: Piranhas? Toaster? Aquarium?
212728: Play with the controls a little.
212752: You want to get the water running into the pipe opening.
212792: TURN THE WHEEL to get the water running.
212828: You also need to TURN THE HANDLE. This shuts off the feed to the lawn
sprinklers.
212896: Of course, the door is still open.
212924: So exit the chamber and close the door.
212952: Wait a little while...
212972: EXAMINE DIAL... and wait for it to reach "1."
213016: Bingo! The waterwheel is now turning!
213044: You don't want to be eaten by a lurking Gru... er... Brain Policeman,
do you?
213104: Are you sure you should be playing a text adventure?
213140: YES.
213148: You need the Diploma of Thought to get in through the main door.
213196: You can still get in, though.
213220: Take the side entrance.
213240: Down the alley.
213252: It's locked?
213264: There's always the fire escape.
213288: Enter through the window.
213308: Take it along.
213320: There's something in it...
213372: What goes inside a pillow?
213392: Feathers.
213400: See the Pond area hints for more information.
213432: You'll need to find another way around him.
213464: Like the catwalk.
213480: Put it to sleep.
213492: Not what you think!
213508: Don't you have anything that could appeal to it?
213544: From the Pond area?
213560: Go there, and see if you can find something.
213592: The book the duck showed you.
213616: Read it to the cat.
213680: I assume you're talking about the clock.
213712: It's quite strange, isn't it?
213736: The fifth koan may help you understand it better.
213812: There's a hint in the astral rooms on how to disable it.
213852: Look at the picture Sal has painted.
213880: A paintbrush... a clock... a key.
213908: Get out of the astral rooms, and you're back in front of the clock.
213956: You'll notice it has a key in the back.
213984: GET KEY WITH BRUSH.
214008: Don't forget to take the clock, too. It's safe now.
214048: That was funny only once. But I did get you to look!
214088: There are three places you can sit.
214116: In West Seating, Main Seating or East Seating.
214156: You can always change the channel.
214180: There's the ever-popular "closed-captioned" version.
214220: Come on, now!
214232: Bring some light.
214248: You can find a light source in the Science Art Museum.
214288: Like the glowing rock.
214304: Break the jar.
214316: UNDO.
214324: Think about what the first koan said. It helps you better understand
what's in the jar along with the key.
214400: You'll need to cover the jar to not get hurt.
214432: With a blanket.
214444: Or your robe, if you're feeling lucky.
214472: See the next questions for more hints.
214500: One of it's major components.
214524: Okay, so you knew that.
214544: What might fit?
214556: What kinds of shows are put on in Planetariums besides Astronomy
programs?
214608: How about laser-light shows?
214632: The laser from the Science Art Museum.
214664: Can't you find anything out by yourself?
214696: The white button turns the lights on and off.
214728: The black button turns the projector on and off.
214764: Only when the projector is working, though.
214796: Don't read on until you've been to Power Plant North.
214836: Don't read on until you've seen the reactor core.
214872: Don't read on until you've overloaded the reactor core.
214912: Don't read on until you've asked Geordi about the core.
214952: Don't read on.
214996: The third koan may be of some help here.
215024: You're no ducky.
215040: The duck is, though.
215056: Destroy it. You know you want to.
215084: You'll need the golf club.
215104: Parti won't let you?
215120: What could you show him that would satisfy him?
215156: The membership card.
215172: Now try again.
215208: As a memento of your playing, the club shouldn't be that hard to keep.
215260: Parti wants to make certain you've played all the holes.
215388: Ever heard of Konrad Lorenz?
215412: He found out that ducks follow the first person they see after birth.
215484: Take it for a walk. Everywhere.
215508: What's that it finds? A book?
215532: It also leaves feathers at the Petting Zoo.
215564: Notice anything odd about the duck?
215592: It behaves rather like a dog.
215616: Maybe it could get the key for you?
215644: POINT AT KEY.
215660: This IS an UnFair, you know.
215684: Prove to him that you're worthy, and you'll get it.
215724: Each time you approach him, he will comment on whether or not he
believes you are worthy.
215788: The second koan may be of some real help, here.
215824: Show Boothe something entitling you to a freebie.
215860: Like your membership card.
215880: Then toss a ring! What fun!
215904: Have you meditated about all the items available?
215940: Have you done the Milky Way quiz?
215968: What keeps milk warm?
215984: You'll need the mug.
216000: Show Karni something entitling you to a freebie.
216036: Like your membership card.
216056: Now TAKE QUIZ. When you're done, don't forget to DROP QUIZ. (Just
kidding.)
216124: Answer the questions correctly.
216148: You only have one try.
216164: It's not hard, however.
216184: It's a trick quiz, in fact.
216208: Have you asked Professor Parti about the quiz?
216244: The astronomical questions are all wrong.
216276: That leaves the other questions.
216340: Get your prize.
216352: And be sure to keep it safe.
216372: Is it too cold?
216384: Here's where an understanding of the second koan comes in handy.
216432: Seen any warming experiences around here?
216464: Take it for a ride!
216480: Several rides, actually.
216500: Just don't scald it.
216516: Use the range from your kitchen, then.
216544: Just don't scald the milk.
216564: They're fun! Enjoy!
216580: They also serve a practical purpose.
216608: It's not only you who feels hot after such a ride.
216644: The milk does, too.
216660: Just don't scald it.
216676: He does not.
216688: He only wounds you.
216704: Use the cow vase to catch the blood. You can use it for the Piranhas,
later.
216760: Come on! What knife-thrower?
216816: Don't panic.
216828: Return to your beds, citizens.
216852: See the next question for more hints.
216880: Time to go to bed!
216896: Be sure you have everything you need to go to sleep.
216932: You can tell by typing "SCORE."
216960: You'll find the bedroom door unlocked.
216988: Enter the bedroom.
217004: SLEEP.
217012: Yay! You win!
217024: He doesn't like your looks.
217044: You need a disguise.
217060: WEAR WIG. WEAR GROUCHO MASK. WEAR FELT HAT.
217116: SHOW FUNNY BONE TO BOUNCER.
217152: ASK BOUNCER ABOUT MARX BROTHERS.
217192: ASK BOUNCER WHY I AM READING THIS HINT.
217272: I just said!
217284: Type "AMUSING" now.
217304: Wait... you must have typed that already, or you wouldn't be reading
this hint.
217364: Unless you're reading ahead.
217388: Shame on you.
217400: HA ha.
217408: WARNING! Read the following hints ONLY AS A LAST RESORT! Doing so
without really needing to may completely spoil the game for you!
217516: Red: In the alarm clock, backstage in the Point of View theater.
217564: Green: At the bottom of the pond.
217592: Blue: Around Barker's neck, at the fair.
217624: Yellow: Attached to the teddy bear, inside the pyramid.
217664: Violet: Inside a glass jar in the observatory.
217700: Now if you only knew how to get them...
217732: WARNING! Read the following hints ONLY AS A LAST RESORT! Doing so
without really needing to may completely spoil the game for you!
217840: Blanket: Observatory, after activating the projector.
217880: Milk: The fair, after winning the quiz, throwing rings and taking two
rides.
217936: Alarm Clock: Backstage in the Point of View theater.
217976: Teddy Bear: Inside the pyramid, after winning the Kite Race.
218024: Stuffed Pillow: The pillowcase is backstage at the Point of View
theater, the feathers are in the Petting Zoo.
218104: Now if you only knew how to get them...
218136: WARNING! Read the following hints ONLY AS A LAST RESORT! Doing so
without really needing to may completely spoil the game for you!
218244: You get points for...
218712: There's only one you really need to know.
218744: And it's from the original adventure.
218772: Try typing WIN.

As you step out of the black shell, removing the metal discs from your
skin, you feel strangely light. You look around the room.

Dr. Dumont looks the
same as when you left, moments ago in the lab. He celebrates his triumph with
laughter and little whoops of noise. You notice a strange smell, then buzzing
and crackling sounds. The walls of the lab appear to glow. You blink your eyes
then look closely. The air, the walls, the lab equipment--even Dr. Dumont--it's
all the same as it was before.

Except, you can see the molecules in everything
dancing, dancing, dancing.
221016: Even though you have everything, you can't sleep. You know you forgot
to do something.
221080: How can you sleep without all of your nighttime things?
221120: You toss and turn but cannot get to sleep. Perhaps you're not

221828: The wires you were holding are yanked from your hands.
221868: The duck quacks a teary-eyed farewell as you vanish in a puff of
lemon-scented smoke.
221930: Excited by your impossible magical return, the duck quacks excitedly on
seeing you.
221992: And slip and break your neck? I wouldn't want to be responsible for
that!
222044: Whee! You twirl around in gay abandon. That was fun!
222084: You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself about.
222120: Let's see... one, two, cha-cha-cha!
222152: Let's twist again, like we did last summer.
222184: Inspired by slam-dancers, you throw yourself at the ground.
