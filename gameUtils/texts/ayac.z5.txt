15672: o. You have won
15756: It is now pitch dark in here!
15783: I beg your pardon?
15847: Sorry, that can't be corrected.
15876: Think nothing of it.
15929: As good-looking as ever.
15961: You can hardly repeat that.
15986: You can't begin with a comma.
16100: I didn't understand that number.
16129: You can't see any such thing.
16165: You aren't holding that!
16207: I'm not sure what "
16259: That's not a verb I recognise.
16298: You can't see "
16406: Nothing to do!
16423: There are none at all available!
17333: Please answer yes or no.
17359: Are you sure you want to quit?
17404: Failed.

18129: You are carrying nothing.
18178: Taken.
18189: You are always self-possessed.
18722: Dropped.
18830: Removed.
18969: You lack the dexterity.
19050: Done.
19316: Done.
19536: Wrahn seem interested.
20175: You can't go that way.
20735: But it's dark.
20752: You find nothing of interest.
20788: But it's dark.
20879: You find nothing of interest.
22007: . Not bad.
22025: That was a rhetorical question.
22079: That seems unnecessary.
22102: Keep your mind on the game.
22127: What a good idea.
22146: You smell nothing unexpected.
22173: You hear nothing unexpected.
22198: You taste nothing unexpected.
22233: Keep your hands to yourself!
22258: You feel nothing unexpected.
22283: If you think that'll help.
22392: Oh, don't apologise.
22422: Quite.
22491: You achieve nothing by this.
22579: You wave, feeling foolish.
22729: You are unable to.
22748: Nothing obvious happens.
22798: That's not a direction.
22821: Not that way you can't.
22853: Keep your hands to yourself.
22878: You achieve nothing by this.
22911: Futile.
22940: You talk to yourself a while.
22967: This provokes no reaction.
22995: There is no reply.
23014: Nothing is on sale.
23033: Your singing is abominable.
23067: Time passes.
46594: Oh no!
46942: It's already open.
46961: Strange. The door won't close.
47038: That doesn't fit.
47130: M.
47164: Mmm ... pizza.
47264: . Inside the pot
48182: Discreetly taken.
48294: There's no phone here!
48317: There's no dial tone.
48358: Probably pointless.
48410: This is Dorm A, right here.
48509: A hollow voice says, "No."
50932: in" or "notin
50948: opmhas" or "hasnt
51090: }" at end of "objectloop

52904: Please give one of the answers above.
52932: [You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
52968: [Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
53008: "Oops" can only correct a single word.
53036: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
53068: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
53128: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
53172: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
53212: I didn't understand that sentence.
53272: You seem to have said too little!
53296: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
53332: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
53368: You excepted something not included anyway!
53400: You can only do that to something animate.
53432: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
53480: I didn't understand the way that finished.
53512: Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which exactly?
53664: Are you sure you want to restart?
53688: The game file has verified as intact.
53716: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupt.
53760: Attempt to begin transcript failed.
53788: Attempt to end transcript failed.
53812: You're carrying too many things already.
53844: You can't put something on top of itself.
53876: You can't put something inside itself.
53904: That would scarcely empty anything.
53960: You can only get into something free-standing.
53996: But you aren't in anything at the moment.
54028: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
54068: is now in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gives long
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
54164: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).
54248: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
54424: This dangerous act would achieve little.
54452: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
54484: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
54516: Digging would achieve nothing here.
54544: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
54572: You would achieve nothing by this.
54596: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
54624: But there's no water here to carry.
54652: Real adventurers do not use such language.
54684: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
54712: There's not enough water to swim in.
54740: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
54768: That would be less than courteous.
54792: Is that the best you can think of?
54816: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
54856: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
54888: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
55084: This pile of ash might be the remains of some other objects.
55128: Leave the horrible dirty ash alone.
55432: Wait ...

Something feels different. It's only a vague, almost
imperceptible feeling, but the whole atmosphere of the MUD has changed subtly.
It seems somehow more serious, more urgent, more real ...
55584: Just down the corridor, the way is blocked by a fall of rubble.
Evidently, the Auditorium of Tomorrow is yesterday's news.
56128: Strangely, you can no longer find any way to enter the monolith. You're
sure you've done it before, but you just can't remember how.
56224: This area seems to have been subjected to the same brutal truncation as
much of the rest of the MUD. Now the road simply peters out, with nothing in
sight except the terrace back west.
56352: It's a perfectly ordinary phone booth. Strangely, however, the door,
which you always thought had been welded shut, is now open. I still wouldn't
try your luck at picking it up, though.
56484: Such a stupid action doesn't even deserve the usual paragraph about how
you pick up the phone booth and are crushed by its weight. Let's just settle
for:
56592: On the inside, the phone booth looks just as normal as it did on the
outside. The only difference is that the phone, instead of having a slot for
coins, appears to have a small hole for cork nuts.
56848: That would probably gum up the inside of the phone with melted cheese.
56896: You hear the cork nut fall down inside the phone.
57056: A small card is taped to the inside of the phone booth.
57096: It's jut one of those big flat boxes pizzas come in.
57134: Taken.

A hollow voice says, "All our pizza boxes are made from
super-biodegradable materials, and hence do no damage to the environment.

The
pizza box transforms into fine silver dust, which vanishes.
57282: One lousy slice of pizza? Is that all their free offer is worth?
57332: Trying to stick things back on the pizza is stupid, not to mention
impossible.
57386: Mmm ... delicious. You finish off the whole slice of pizza, fully aware
that you probably just made the game unwinnable or something. But man, it was
worth it.

Don't worry. You haven't really made the game unwinnable.
57548: Mmm ... cheese.
57568: Eating the lump of congealed cheese is kind of disgusting, but highly
enjoyable.
57624: Awwwk! Want cheese-covered cork nuts!
57652: Eaten.

Awwwk! Want more cork nuts!
57684: Like most anchovies, it's probably just a fish-shaped lump made of salt.
57736: You force the horrible anchovy down.
57764: They look just like most other roasted pumpkin seeds.
57804: Black olives.
57816: Kind of shrivelled, like cooked tomatoes often are. It must have fallen
off the pizza.
57878: This room is brilliantly lit from all directions. In fact, it is unclear
where the walls and ceiling end. A doorway leads to the west, and tunnels lead
in most other directions, although all but one are boarded up. An archway
stands at the south end of the hall.

Visible exits: south (to Dorm A), west
(to the Adventurer's Lounge), southwest (to the Big Dig)
58140: The note reads: "We regret that the Round Room, Coder's Tavern, Open
Chamber, Carousel Room, Clay Cube and Rocky Room, as well as parts of other
areas, are closed while the MUD undergoes review."
58292: The Bulletin Board is mysteriously blank.
58326: Rough-hewn tunnels surroud you on all sides. It looks like more digging
has been done here, although the original exit to the northeast is still
visible. More recently, though, several of the tunnels appear to have caved in,
and the ladder which once led up to the hole in the ceiling has
disappeared.

Visible exits: down, northwest, northeast (to the Long Hall),
southwest
58592: This is a simple room. The only interesting features are a transporter
pad by the south wall, and a doorway leading northeast. There are no visible
controls for either.

Visible Exits: northeast, step on transporter pad
58748: A silvery-grey metal pad. Step on it to be teleported.
58788: You step onto the pad, and the room around you glimmers and shimmers and
flickers.
58846: Strange. This isn't where the pad normally leads. Perhaps this is the
closest part of the MUD to the space station that's still accessible.
58952: This tiny, barren room once housed the intake for the MUD incinerator.
Once garbage incineration was outlawed, though (when it was discovered that
when you burn things underground, the air just fills with soot), it became just
a place where people drop old stuff to be recycled.
59148: Pillows are strewn about this lavish chamber. Incense and candles burn
in the four corners of the room, and two pillars rise near the center of the
room. There is a small sign mounted on the left pillar. Scratched into one wall
are the words: "THE END IS NIGH!"
59340: It reads: "The Oracle is on extended sabbatical."
59380: The transformer, while it consists of simply a plain black box,
nonetheless manages to radiate an aura of terrible menace.
59464: The pot is an exact replica of the one from the game. It's standing
directly below the hole in the ceiling
59540: It's dead! Murderers! Savages! Iconoclasts!
59576: Just paperclips.
59588: One octopus (dead).
59604: Luckily, robotic parrots don't need a lot of living space. Nor do they
need an elevator to get down from here, so if you were a robotic parrot, it
wouldn't matter much to you that the one that used to be here has gone.
Unfortunately, you're not.
59776: Far below, you can see the hole in the makeshift new ceiling of the
lounge, which was evidently erected to keep this magnificent but unlikely perch
out of the sight of the evil suits. If you dropped stuff, it'd probably fall
right down into the lounge.
59978: Hmm ... potato, monkey, octopus, cabbage, paperclips, tomato. Unless
you're mistaken, that's all the ingredients. Maybe you should head down to the
lounge and check what's happening.
60116: Well, if you insist ...

You take a flying leap from the perch and
plunge down through the air. Fortunately, you pass out as you are falling, so
you never hear the sickening crack your body makes as it lands.
60264: Mmm, cork nut.
60276: You take just the tiniest nibble from the cork nut. It's a cork nut
alright. But maybe you should check it's a cork nut all the way down to the
bottom.
60384: Mmm ... cork nutty goodness. You probably just made the game unwinnable,
but who cares?
60448: The once-proud lounge has been gutted right down to the bare stone
walls. All the exits have been bricked up, except for the one to the east, and
a hole in the ceiling is all there is to show that an elevator once lead
upwards. An uncomfortable-looking steel chair sits in the centre of the room.
60654: The middle suit demands, "Are you Dan Shiovitz, also known by the
criminal alias of 'inky'?"

inky nods mutely.
60742: "Do you admit that you have often in the past frequented this ..." - the
suit looks around in disgust - "place? This den of idiocy, frivolity and wanton
fun?"

inky nods, still too terrified to speak.
60892: The second suit smiles mirthlessly. "Then we may begin. As you can see,
your companions have already stood trial, and been sentenced."
60990: The third suit produces an unpleasant-looking device and waves it at
inky. "This is what we in our no-nonsense way like to call a transformer. It
can transform dangerous miscreants such as yourself into simple and serious
things like vegetables. Vegetables have never been known to give us any
trouble."

The first suit mutters, "We like vegetables."
61240: The second suit asks, "Does the phrase 'You are a chef!' mean anything
to you?"
61302: The third suit waves the transformer threateningly. "Answer him!"

inky
inclines his head a fraction of an inch.
61386: "Do you deny that you are the author of the, ah, game" - the suit
grimaces, as if the word leaves a bad taste in his mouth - "'You are a
chef!'?"

inky shakes his head, still remaining silent.
61530: "Do you recognise, therefore, that you are one of the most dangerous
sources of lunacy ever tried before this collective?"

inky speaks for the
first time. "Lunacy?"
61652: "Come, come, Mr. Shiovitz," growls the first suit, "you must surely
recognise the utter disregard for everything serious, sensible and ordered,
everything, in short, which we stand for, which your travesty displays." 

inky
does not respond.
61828: "No? Very well then, Mr. Shiovitz."

The second suit produces, as if
from nowhere, a large pot, which he places on the ground. Into it he drops
several paperclips, a monkey and an octopus.
61968: "Now, Mr. Shiovitz. If you can prove to us that it is possible to cook
anything edible using thse unlikely ingredients, we may just spare your
miserable life."
62084: The first suit continues, "Obviously, this, ah, MUD will have to be shut
down. We can't allow places like this to continue acting as the catalysts for
insanity they so obviously are."

inky mutters something.

"Your friends, Mr.
Shiovitz? Honestly, what did you think we were going to do with them? Let them
go to waste?"

You hear the sound of one of the suits' stomach rumbling.
62364: inky struggles in the chair for a few moments, then slumps in defeat.
"Oh, there is no escape, Mr. Shiovitz," says the second suit.

"Only one
question remains ..."
62612: The three suits are watching inky.
62636: Iron safe falls from the sky! It lands on top of second suit and breaks
him open!

The third suit stops pointing the transformer at inky and rushes to
attend the remains of his colleague. As he kneels down by the bloody pulpy
mess, inky takes advantage of the distraction and transforms the two remaining
suits into toads. As is always the case, the moment the bad guys are defeated,
their works are un-done and the vegetables all transform back into the MUDders
you know and love. Quickly, the wizards repair the damage done to the MUD, and
all returns to a state of blessed happiness and fun.
63100: . The suits look doubtful, but remains calm as the second instructs,
"Very well, Mr. Shiovitz, now eat
63176: under the owlish gaze of the three suits. They continue to watch him for
several minutes until it becomes obvious that death is not immediately
imminent.

"Very well, Mr. Shiovitz," says the first suit, "you may go."

From
his pocket he produces a carrot named Alex and considers it briefly. "Shame to
let all these vegtables go to waste," he reflects. "Shut down this thing and
we'll have a stew."
63464: The elevator is gone.
63480: The ceiling is lower than it was before, a layer of panelling put up
just above head height. Although the elevator which once led up to Alex's perch
has gone, this is evidently a recent development, as a hole in the new ceiling
marks where it once was.
63656: It looks exactly like the sort of chair you strap people in to
interrogate them. This is because that's what it is.
63736: inky has a hunted look to him, as if he's being interrogated by evil men
in suits who want to turn him into a vegetable. There is quite possibly a
reason for this.
63884: Apart from some minor differences in height, the three suits are
identical. If they had little wires coming out of their ears, they'd look just
like agents from
63996: Three suits stand in a semicircle around the chair.
64032: You can't reach the pot without alerting the suits.
64068: You couldn't do that without giving yourself away to the suits.
64112: Maybe you should work out what's going on first.
64148: It might be wise not to draw any attention to yourself.
64188: It's a banana.
64200: You peel the banana. After a few seconds, the skin grows back.

  Once a fix or enhancement is in place, it will be announced
on the 
  channel '#mud-updates'.
65500: You can't make a telephone call with that!
65532: A recorded voice announces, "That number is not available. You have not
been charged for this call."
65604: A friendly voice from the pizza parlor answers and explains that as
their one millionth caller, you are entitled to a free pizza. You barely have
time to wonder at this extremely fortuitous and unlikely coincidence before you
hear a screech of tyres from outside and the noise of something flat and made
of cardboard hitting the ground, followed by the click from the phone of the
pizza person hanging up.
65880: You fruit on the spot, jumplessly. No, wait, that isn't right.
65928: You apply a great deal of concentration, and find yourself walking into
another place.
65990: For some reason, the usual jollity of your homemsg fails to manifest
itself.
66048: You are obviously confused. Please be kind to yourself.
66088: You don't want to upset those nasty men in suits by materialising in the
middle of the lounge. Maybe you should just walk there.
66180: For some reason, you have a really bad feeling about doing that. Maybe
it would be better to head for the lounge in the normal fashion.
66276: A hollow voice hands you a banana.
