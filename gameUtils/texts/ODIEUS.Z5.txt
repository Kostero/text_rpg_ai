35327: A big empty cup.
35340: A big cup that's always filled to the brim with water.
35394: Youch!! The water is so boiling hot that you can't bring the cup near
it.
35460: The water begins to fill the cup and doesn't stop till the whole pond
dries up. It is amazing how the cup manage to hold all that water.
35566: The cup is already full.
35684: It is as polished as it can be.
35707: Your best polishing effort has no effect on the dusty plate.
35754: The wooden cabinet has been opened.
35807: Its shelves are empty.
35878: The contraption is made of stainless steel, has a slot about six inches
long, a lever is attached to it's side, and a sign is pasted onto it.
36135: That started the machine humming. A few moments later it quiets down and
the lever springs back to its original position.
36240: The dwarf seems to steal glances at you while you're not watching.
36289: "HiHo, HiHo...", hums Gruffy, the dwarf.
36349: Giving the silverware to the dwarf must have caught his attention, since
he tosses you his axe in return and walks jubiliantly away. You hear him mumble
something about the ingenious financial abilities of magicians.
36503: He's the one holding the axe, not you!
36537: "Touch me and you die."
36622: The tremendous oak sways, hovers dangerously, then topples to the ground
with a loud CRASH.
36704: The oak is too heavy for your puny muscles.
36735: The oak tree is firmly rooted to the ground.
36780: The branches are beyond your reach.
36840: Lying on it's side amidst the tall grass is a huge oak.
36891: At the very tip of one long branch dangles a diamond encrusted key!
36938: Just like any other ordinary oak tree you've encountered.
37026: There is no fire to light the branch.
37058: The wood is already burnt up.
37093: Lighting the branch turns it into a handy torch.
37133: Your torch finally burns up.
37158: A double-edged axe is embedded in the ground.
37199: It is wiser to heed the sign.
37338: Hnpond of cool water.
37371: You take a few sips and find the water refreshing.
37413: The only thing you will get is wet if you don't use a container.
37478: A surreal idea.
37494: The greenhouse contains a variety of exotic plants, tropical greenery.
In the middle of some purple-black shrubs sits
37655: Someone has stolen all the bananas from the tree. It is now as bare as a
new-born baby.
37718: It is bulging with banana clusters, all of which are as hard as rock.
37775: You can't put anything on the banana tree.
37810: Some green bananas are scattered around.
37847: Try as you might, you are unable to remove the peel.
37923: A tall, healthy, and bright green beanstalk stretches high into the
heavens. It is bursting with enormous beans and leaves, all too large to
handle.
38030: There is a four-foot-high plant occupying the plot.
38080: I think the plant has enough water for the time being.
38144: The plant shudders visibly, then all of a sudden shoots up in a long,
green streak of leaves and zips through the ceiling. You cannot see where it
ends.
38290: You walk in holding the polished plate over your face. The sphinx
catches sight of it's own face reflected in the mirror-like surface of the
plate and turns to dust.
38413: Facing you is a deadly stone guardian-sphinx. It has you fixed with it's
fatal stare. You recall from your college lectures the result of meeting the
sphinx's gaze - instant stonification.
38641: A few seconds after planting the beans, a greenish plant emerges and
struggles to a height of about four feet.
38718: You threw the bean into the bubbling hot water and waited. A minute
later, the water spits out the green bean which travels in a graceful arc and
lands right back into your hand. Nothing else interesting has happened.
38945: The bubbling recedes and at length ceases. After a while, the steam from
the hot springs disappears.
39016: As soon as you planted the blue bean, the temperature of the greenhouse
started to fall rapidly. Somewhere an alarm sounded, and the soil spits out the
blue bean which travels in a graceful arc and lands right back into your hand.
Nothing else interesting has happened.
39220: A portly gorilla emerges from the Pit's depths and bars your
way.

"Comin' to see the old boy, eh?" the gorilla chuckles, "Jolly good! Er -
there is the small matter of a tiny fee, of course. Purely for entry purposes,
you understand..." He beams good-naturedly.
39422: A hairy arm blocks your way. "The fee, sir?"
39522: There is a stout gorilla here, waiting expectantly.
39574: The gorilla looks at your offering disdainfully. "Surely, you can do
better than that," he yawns.
39661: The gorilla's nostrils open wide. "Umm...er...that'll do nicely," he
manages, relieving you of your fee. He stumbles over to the side and stares at
it, drooling in admiration.
39797: The lost of your flingshot must have affected your brain.
39843: "An entry fee, sir, not a sexual favour!"
39912: Bought anything for me?"
39961: "I'm sorry but I was expelled from the obedience school the old boy has
send me. I wasn't good at following orders, you see."
40106: Xnscratches his armpits.
40172: The bird wakes up, finds itself in familiar surroundings, and goes back
to sleep again.
40241: With a deafening SKRAKIT, the bird spreads its wings and flies away.
40379: The lions chase you out of the den but go no further...
40426: An oval table and satin seats mark this room as the dining room. The
exits to the east and west are labeled, respectively, living room and den.
40534: A section of the wall has opened to reveal a closet to the north.
40598: It resists your attempts to move it. Maybe you should twist it.
40663: The section of the wall slides smoothly close and the closet disappears
from view.
40734: A section of the wall slides smoothly open. There is now a closet to the
north.
40911: The lions growl hungrily.
40957: Whoever said that "Music sooths the savage beast" obviously didn't know
about these lions. They stare at you in disbelief as you blow your silly little
horn.
41087: The lions stop growling.
41124: Removing your fur coat is a big mistake. The lions soon realised that
they have been tricked. The only consolation is that your death is swift.
41294: The ferocious-looking lions are glaring at you for disturbing them.
41353: The lions seem to hold the wearer of the fur coat in awe. In fact they
looked terrified.
41416: They seem ready to tear you to pieces any time.
41460: .
The lions
41495: decided that they cannot wait any longer. What follows is a little
gruesome, let's say it involves some screaming and a bit of bloodshed. One
thing is for sure:
41650: The lions frown as if they vaguely recognised the fur coat. The frown
was soon dispelld by growls as hunger overrules the attempts to think.
41788: They back off in fright, leaving you clear passage to the doorway.
41835: The lions will tear you to shreds. Definitely.
41882: Leave the frightened kittens alone, you big bully!
41919: There are too many lions to be dealt with by one throw.
41970: Don't push your luck.
41987: Losing your head, aren't you?
42015: These lions are definitely not circus-trained.
42083: It is doubtful that the lions will appreciate your show of generosity.
42134: This is the living room. It is rather strange, since everything here
seems to be alive. The chairs are singing, the lamp fixture is sweeping the
carpet, and the air conditioner is
42375: The door's black mood is suddenly replaced by a cheerful one. "Trying to
get through?" it observes, "my pleasure." It opens wide.
42474: Someone left a black horn on the floor.
42517: Only a reed can fit into the horn.
42564: As you play the horn, you feel a sense of calm over you.
42610: This area appears to be the power source for the entire Pit complex.
Pipes and wires are strewn about, and there is a series of holes on the far
end, all occupied
42751: About an inch in diameter. It
42825: All the holes are occupied.
42881: The object is a perfect fit. In fact, it seems to be stuck in the hole.
And, oh yes, the entire room has lighted up.
43021: The door closes and you feel yourself moving for a few minutes. Then the
door slides open again.
43099: You explore the rest of the cavern, carefully avoiding the 30 feet
radius that contains the giant, but find no other exit.
43250: A disgusting idea.
43289: As you enter the cavern, a strong draft smelling of beer blows out your
torch...
43378: The eyes of the giant open wide. Then, upon catching sight of you, they
open wider. Wildy and speechlessly gesticulating in horror, it bounds to its
feet and scrambles bellowing out of the room.

As the dust settles, you see a
flight of stairs that was covered by the giant.
43580: I wouldn't go within ten feet of those socks if I were you. You could
die from the stench.
43672: This is Blackwing's safe. Buried among his various treasures is your
precious flingshot. You grab the flingshot (with a fair helping to some spoils)
and fling yourself back home.
43812: The keyholes are of the wrong size.
43864: The bananas are now in the holes. I know this is difficult to believe,
but the bananas acted as a key and caused a secret passageway to open revealing
a staircase leading downward.
43994: The secret passageway disappears.
44027: You almost broke your tooth: this banana is made of gold.
44075: Just say "up" or "down" will do.
44107: It is prudent not to cut the plant that you're on.
44361: Cursing and Spell Flinging.
    Just two zifs ago, your bitter archenemy
Blackwing son of Blackfeather has deviously contrived to seperate you from the
most important instrument of your field - your magic flingshot. Being an expert
Filcher, he has successfully executed his evil designs. But you don't panic,
you keep calm. Only after scrambling through the village yelling at the top of
your lungs and frantically searching through every nook and cranny for a clue,
do you finally decide to consult your friend and fellow Flinger, Zinness son of
Zinnesess.
    Having reclined liesurely on his plush velvet sofa and chatted
comfortably for about half a zif, he advises you to pursue Blackwing and obtain
eternal vengeance. You bravely undertake the mission and declare your absolute
confidence, but oddly you can't stand up since your knees are shaking too much.
When you recover, Zinness takes you into his flingroom and transports you
somewhere near Blackwing's abode; that is, the Pit.
45306: Enchanter.
45320: Master Flinger.
45338: Effective Curser.
45398: I wouldn't consider this a suitable place to start your agricultural
experiments. Perhaps some other place where the environment is friendlier.
45548: Frankly, your bare hands will do the job.

45872: You can't go that way.
45940: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
45972: As good-looking as ever.
45992: This cool grassy area is where Zinness flung you. Apparently you are
somewhere near Blackwing's Pit. To the south a glass structure glints in the
sun, and a dismal cottage lies to the east.
46128: The cottage's interior is rather nice, actually. A heavy marble table
sits among ruby tiles, gold trimming lines ornate pillars, and the sapphire
studded ceiling is garnished with a crystal chandelier.
46268: There is a setting of beautiful silverware here.
46304: A fine set of silver pieces.
46324: A dusty plate lies disconsolately in a dusty corner.
46360: A wooden cabinet is fixed to the wall. It is closed.
46412: I'm sorry, it's written in Polish.
46440: This is the beginning of a pleasant meadow that continues to the east.
Tall grass is swept with soft zephyrs, whistling through the elegant yews which
surround you. There is a particularly large oak on your right. A glass
structure glints in the sun to the west.
46624: Sitting on a nearby tree stump is a gruff-looking dwarf.
46664: Huge fingers stroke a fiery red beard as he hums a gruff tune. A double
edged axe is strapped to his side.
46740: A thick piece of branch that was broken off from an oak tree.
46784: A very sharp tree-chopping tool.
46808: You have reached the end of the pleasant meadow that started from the
west. The grass over here is curiously singed at the bottom.
46960: Crystal clear, probably drinkable.
46992: This grey area is filled with stone sculptures of all types of
creatures. Upon closer examination you note they are extraordinarily well
carved. A strange feeling you usually don't get in museums comes over you.
47140: A warning sign hangs above the entrance to the west.
47176: The sign depicts the usual skull-and-crossed-bone sign. It is carved out
of stone.
47236: Too life-like to be sculpted by hands.
47264: The room you've just entered is totally bare of all furniture. It is
colored grey, and filled with dust.
47340: This is a small cell whose walls are composed of a massive inter-twining
of trailing vines which convene above you in a big tangle of leaves and ivy.
47444: You recognize them as part of the magic bean family, classed by the
revered magi-biologist, Jack son of Jackyl, under Aurius Stawcus. Two of them
have different properties, but you can't remember what the properties are.
47600: You recognize them as part of the magic bean family, classed by the
revered magi-biologist, Jack son of Jackyl, under Aurius Stawcus. Two of them
have different properties, but you can't remember what the properties are.

The
blue beans are cold to the touch.
47788: Before you, spiralling downward, lies the great black maw of Blackwing's
Pit.
47844: The gorilla is covered with black fur, skin, muscles, veins, and
whatever else gorillas are usually covered with. Most of his face is covered
with a stupid grin. You assume he is stronger than you are.
47988: You are standing in the grand hallway of the Pit. Faint light comes from
an opening above you. Large open doorways beckon from three sides. A fireplace
burns behind you.
48108: The fire is blazing brightly. It warms the room cheerfully.
48152: The object is about one inch long, round, one inch in diameter, and
threaded at one end.
48216: This appears to be a taxedermist display area. Stuffed creatures abound
everywhere with plaques marking them below.
48296: All written in Latin and you cannot understand a word of it.
48340: Oddly enough, there is a bird here who is very much alive. It is
sleeping.
48396: The bird has a long beak, blue-green feathers, and sharp talons. It is
presently asleep.
48460: A brass ring is attached to the east wall.
48492: This is obviously the den. A family of lions are presently occupying the
room. Behind them to the northeast is an open doorway.
48592: You interrupted a conversation going on between the door and the window.
That made the door quite furious, and I doubt he'll let you through.
48692: To the north, a door is hob-knobing with the fixtures.
48732: It seems to be a musical chair, since it is participating in a chorus of
other chair-voices.
48796: Seems to be in poor health.
48816: A rather diligent fellow.
48836: The lovely black horn comes from the goat species Quatikus, and, if
fitted with the proper reed, it supposedly will calm all anger and sooth savage
beasts.
48944: You are behind the den of lions. Whatever they were placed there to
guard must have already been removed, as there doesn't seem to be anything of
value about.
49064: Someone has scribbled something on it: "All keys grow on trees.
49112: You are in a tight closet, presumably the elevator. A red button is on
the wall.
49172: Big, red button. Designed to be pushed.
49208: A coat has been carelessly discarded on the floor.
49244: Oh my, a fur coat sewn from an entire lion skin.
49280: This is a tremendous cavern. There is a stifling stench in the air. The
elevator is back south.
49348: A 20 feet tall, wide and deep giant is snoring gratingly over here.
49396: A 20 foot tall, wide and deep giant is snoring gratingly over here. At
every breath you are consumed by a fog of beer-black breath. In addition to his
breath, his socks give off an odor that almost knocks YOUR socks off.
49556: A flight of stairs plunges downward.
49584: This is the bottom of the rickety staircase.
49616: Before you stands a wooden wall, studded with many large keyholes.
49664: The keyholes run from bottom to top, and are extraordinarily big.
49712: This room is shaped like a hexagon. It is colored red, the overhead
lights are shattered, and the floor has a colorful mosiac.
49800: You're on a beanstalk! You can only go up or down this gigantic plant.
49852: You are about one quarter up the tall beanstalk, and 200 feet above the
greenhouse.
49912: Down is more likely.
49928: This is where the tall beanstalk thins out. Only the tip emerges amongst
the fluffy white clouds. It is rather silent up here.
50016: There is a golden banana here, glistening in the light.
50056: Pure gold. Clouds may not have a silver lining but they sure have golden
bananas.
