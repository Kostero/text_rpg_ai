52616: Bribe Randal with porn.
52636: No, with GOOD porn.
52656: I don't know.
52668: She is pure evil.
52684: Asian design major my ass.
52704: Go to Blockbuster and rent *Clerks* already.

53508: Why is Ed Mueller such an awesome bloody programmer?
53772: Far off toward the northwest, a small, oddly shaped building sits atop a
small hill.
53832: Being a pumpkin, you lack things like feet, legs, and brains.
53896: Best to leave them alone, buddy.
53920: It's an old church, an unpainted, one-room affair, a monument to the
hard toils and simple, humble devotion of the pioneer-folk who hand-built it. 
Recently the Cow-In-A-Box corporation bought it and turned it into a burger
stand.  The Son Of God hangs from the roof, offering salvation and condiments
to all. 

This late in the afternoon, there's something disquieting about the
shadow that the steeple casts.
54472: Miller? 

The shadow resembles a pumpkin monster.  Woooooo, pumpkin
monster!!!!
54552: Wooooooooooooooo.
54568: He planted you.
54580: Bored now.
54600: Round.
54606: You feel like such a whore. 

First they washed you.  They rubbed your
skin with a soft cloth, made you clean and gleaming.  Then they painted you a
face, a cute little 'hello, sailor' smirk.  After examining your weight, luster
and overall beauty, they determined your price. 

Then they put you out with
the others, to wait for passers-by.
54860: It's okay to kill them cause Americans don't have souls.
54916: Roundish.
54924: Being a pumpkin, you have no hands.
54952: Unfortunately, this is not a text adventure game.
55002: How cuuuuuute.
55114: The road is to the east.
55132: "I just wanna take a whiz in your cornfield," you tell the farmer. 

He
snorts.  "Field's for paying customers only."
55238: Now go beet off.
55380: The road continues north.
55904: Tax dollars at work my ass.
55924: The back door is open.
55940: The back door is closed.
56016: A shiny key.
56216: Jesus died for somebody's sins, but not yours.
56252: Unlike most tables, this one has four legs.
56284: It's mostly beef lips. 

Leave it alone; this won first place in this
year's science fair  [Footnote Ten].
56418: Footnote Ten].
56432: Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. 

Wow, you haven't felt an electric weenie that
good since your Paris summer with Andy Warhol.
56616: A chemistry lab is south, and a cafeteria is to the west.
56754: Another hallway is north.
56776: A large, metalish cart to organise and shelve plates and what-not.
56824: The cart is too heavy to pick up.
56924: A nurse's station is southwest.
57138: You can see Turtle, the friendly turtle mascot here.  Someone has
painted mean and hateful slogans on his shell.
57220: Yes, yes, tell me about your childhood.
57252: Well, unfortunately, that's what Turtle gets for being openly gay in a
rabidly right-wing podunk town like this.
57492: All the world's a fucking stage.
57532: Woooooooooooooooo.
57546: Oh my Goddess!  It's the story of a psycho-killer who wanders the halls
of a high school, strangling the cheerleaders and shit!  Is this foreshadowing?
 Postshadowing?  Charcoal shading?  Cubis 

Oh, forget it. 

Do-over! 

Oh, my
Goodness.  It's the story of a teenage girl, coming of age in a sleepy Southern
town at the turn of the civil rights movement.  She befriends an aging,
alcoholic ex-prostitute, and together the women embark upon a journey of
self-discovery.  Until some psycho killer picks their asses off.
57924: Taken. 

Touch it again and I'll break your damn arm.
57966: Imagine the gymnasium at wherever you went to high school at.  That's
exactly what this place looks like.  A hallway is south.  The girls' shower
room is northeast.  If there were a boys' shower room it'd be northwest, but
there isn't, cause nobody wants to see that.  The AV Club room is west.


(Okay, *I* don't want to see that.)
58216: What part of BLEACHERS don't you goddamn understand?
58314: DUI!
58376: This game!
59082: But there's nothing in here.
59220: You can see a buxom blonde cheerleader here, all naked and soapy and
humming to herself and blithely oblivious to your presence.  Her neck is all
soft and exposed.  She has the words DESIGNATED VICTIM tattooed on her butt
[Footnote One].
59852: If spam were silver.
59898: Fuck.
59904: Smells like teen spirit.
60044: Wooooooooooooooo.
60060: She helped bring you into this world, and she can take you back out of
it.
60320: He planted you.
60332: He brought you into this world, and he can take you back out of it.
60380: Bored now.
60400: Round.
60678: You can see Britney Spears here.  She has a boo-boo.
60722: Nooooo!  What the hell is wrong with you?! 

Britney is afraid and sad
and begins to sniffle. 

Poor Britney! 

Love on the Britney!  Noogie on her
head!  She was good today.  She ate all her peas and when she colored she
stayed inside the lines.  Yay!  Good Britney! 

Britney claps her hands and
giggles.  :) 

"We're all special cause God don't make junk!" Britney says, and
blows you a kiss.
61020: "You're special!" Britney says, and chews on her tail.
61064: Etc.
61068: A customer walks into the patch.  He begins examining you and your
neighbors.
61124: The customer eyeballs a fat pumpkin to your left.  He thumps it gently,
checks its ripeness.
61190: The customer shakes his head, and checks out another pumpkin to your
right.
61246: The customer shrugs, scratches his chin, and gazes at you.
61292: The customer bends down and picks you up.  Seconds later, his head falls
off, and he expires.  The farmer screams.
61376: The farmer grabs his wife's arm.  "Dangit, maw, your wicca study group
ain't been practicing no hexes on them punkins again, have ya'll?" 

The wife
blushes.  "Sorry!  It were supposed be a high-profits spell, not a
deeeee-capitation spell."
61556: The farmer and wife walk over, prop up the man's corpse, and grab his
head. 

Just before the wife can attempt a reattachment spell, however, a
teenage boy ambles into the area. 

"Kickass jack-o-lantern!"  he says,
pointing to the customer's head.  "It looks just like a severed head!  How much
ya'll want for it?" 

The farmer consults with his wife a moment.  "Eight
bucks," they finally decide. 

"Sold!"  The kid hands the farmer a wad of
bills, takes the head and disappears.
61910: The wife gazes about a moment, then grabs you and slaps you down onto
the corpse's neck.  "Pa," she shouts, "go get my carving knife, this one gonna
need a real face." 

She begins chanting. 

Everything goes all dizzy-like...


There is a flash of bright light, and then you realize you are still standing
in...
62144: She rules.
62152: Foo.
62164: harvey asks, "Is this desire?"]
62200: harvey says, "You're not rid of me."]
62280: harvey whispers, "You oughtta hear my long snake moan."]
62332: harvey shouts, "I'm one big queen!"]
62420: harvey hisses, "You leave me dry."]

MEGA-GOLD HINT MENU, please type HINT at the prompt.)
64016: Yes, yes, we are all quite thoroughly impressed.
64136: You can see a cheerleader hanging out here, practicing for next week's
talent show.  Sounds like... 'Mack The Knife.'  Mouth wide open, eyes closed,
the cheerleader fails to notice that you have entered the room.
64610: Go figure.
64620: There is absolutely nothing funny about eating disorders.  Nothing at
all.  The fact that while thousands of third-world kids starve to death, this
cheerleader here sticks her finger down her throat in fear of gaining half a
pound, this in no way strikes you as being a situation worthy of ridicule.
65544: If she'd been a cornflake girl, this is not really, this is not really,
this is not really happening.
65616: You can see a cheerleader hanging out here, toking on a bowl of herbal
refreshment.
66378: An adorable, brunette waif of a cheerleader is here, making odd moaning
and wailing noises for no apparent reason.
66460: You kissy-kissy on her face. 

"Mmmm," she says.  "I'm soooooo tense. 
Why don't we go to the shower room?  You can give me a massage.  I want to be
NEKKID and STEAMY STEAMY HOT.  I am ever-so ever-so delicious.  Gee, but what
if my friend is in there?"   She giggles.  "Well, I guess she can join in-"


"Wait, wait, wait," you say.  "This is starting to sound like a porno."


Bjork is confused.  "This is a porno.  Why do you think all these
cheerleaders are all over the place?  Hello, script-impaired much?" 

"Oh. 
Gee."  You shrug.  " Damn," you say, "is my face ever red.  Sorry 'bout all the
murder.  I assumed that was what I was supposed to do." 

"Actually," Bjork
says, "your face is orange." 

"Oh, stop nitpicking, silly-head," you say, and
kill her anyway.  But by then, the porn-flick's director has called the cops,
who haul your ass off to the electric chair. 

Mmmmmm, pumpkin pie.
67156: You attempt to attack the waif. 

Idiot!  Haven't you examined *any* of
these cheerleaders you're trying to kill off?  You can't murder BJORK! 
[Footnote Fifty]  She gives you a spinning roundhouse kick! 

Bjork goes bjerk!
 She lets loose with a high-pitched Icelandic wail, sending shivers up and down
your spine till your head (and all the glass in the immediate area) explodes!
67440: You attempt to bite the waif. 

"Hey!"  Bjork shouts.  She gives you a
hard swat.  "Stop that!  Somebody help me!" 

Ozzy Osborne dashes into the
room, and grabs you.  "I am so incredibly and unbelieveably fucking drunk," he
announces, and bites your head off.
