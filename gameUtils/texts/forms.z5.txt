19289: o. You have won
19450: fhn[Your interpreter does not provide "undo". Sorry!]
19547: Please give one of the answers above.
19578: It is now pitch dark in here!
19605: I beg your pardon?
19623: dxn[You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
19665: ehn[Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
19737: Sorry, that can't be corrected.
19766: Think nothing of it.
19787: "Oops" can only correct a single word.
19821: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
19872: As good-looking as ever.
19896: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
19959: You can hardly repeat that.
19984: You can't begin with a comma.
20012: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

20374: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
20414: I'm not sure what "
20449: You excepted something not included anyway!
20485: You can only do that to something animate.
20520: That's not a verb I recognise.
20550: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
20604: You can't see "
20647: I didn't understand the way that finished.
20742: Nothing to do!
20759: There are none at all available!

21924: Ok.
21942: Save failed.
21957: Ok.
21975: The game file has verified as intact.
22007: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupted (unless you
are playing it with a very primitive interpreter which is unable properly to
perform the test).
22137: Transcripting is already on.
22194: Transcripting is already off.
22243: Score notification on.
22264: Score notification off.
22289: You have visited:

22344: None.
22730: You are carrying nothing.
22779: Taken.
22790: You are always self-possessed.

24006: Done.
24305: Wrahn seem interested.
24524: You can only get into something freestanding.
24646: But you aren't in anything at the moment.
24760: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
24862: You can't go that way.
25048: is now in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gives long
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
25150: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).
25238: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
25552: Darkness, noun. An absence of light to see by.
25683: But it's dark.
25700: You find nothing of interest.
25736: But it's dark.
25827: You find nothing of interest.
26997: . Not bad.
27015: That was a rhetorical question.
27042: This dangerous act would achieve little.
27076: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
27112: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
27149: That seems unnecessary.
27172: Keep your mind on the game.
27197: What a good idea.
27216: You smell nothing unexpected.
27243: You hear nothing unexpected.
27268: You taste nothing unexpected.
27303: Keep your hands to yourself!
27328: You feel nothing unexpected.
27353: If you think that'll help.
27379: Digging would achieve nothing here.
27446: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
27479: You would achieve nothing by this.
27508: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
27541: But there's no water here to carry.
27572: Oh, don't apologise.
27594: Real adventurers do not use such language.
27629: Quite.
27640: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
27673: There's not enough water to swim in.
27704: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
27768: You achieve nothing by this.
27856: You wave, feeling foolish.
28006: You are unable to.
28025: Nothing obvious happens.
28048: That would be less than courteous.
28086: Is that the best you can think of?
28115: That's not a direction.
28138: Not that way you can't.
28170: Keep your hands to yourself.
28195: You achieve nothing by this.
28229: Futile.
28241: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
28293: You talk to yourself a while.
28320: This provokes no reaction.
28348: There is no reply.
28367: Nothing is on sale.
28386: Your singing is abominable.
28412: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
28449: Time passes.
28464: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
42291: That's not something you can take.
50482: It's a long way down.
50504: Your voice echoes weirdly up and down the shaft.
50595: The sea; and stone; and springtime-fields.
50698: That jacket's awfully warm in this heat.
50740: You clamber out onto the roof.
50768: The window is shut, and thus blocks your passage.
50811: You sit down and play INFIDEL for a few minutes, but you're stuck at 360
points.
50878: Simply a sheet of polished glass; it is unframed. Your reflection moves
flat and two-dimensional, as if you -- or a flipped, spun, and flattened you --
have been captured in the glass.
51071: Wait. The smudge has moved towards the center of the mirror.
51121: Odd. The smudge has vanished from the mirror.
51220: As you reach for the mirror, you freeze: the world behind your
reflection has begun to move, to change. There you are, reaching for the
mirror; but behind is a dim blur of light and dark, tall verticals and thick
horizontals, a hole of vertigo and an unmoving gravity.

You spin, but all that
is behind you is the familiarity of your room. When you look back, the mirror
is unchanged.
51542: Again, you reach for the mirror. The blur returns, and sharpens as your
hand draws closer. You see a dim deep shaft, falling down endlessly.

You touch
the glass: it feels cool and slick. Then the smudge leaps at you, growing,
shifting. You try to draw away, but it runs up your arm, over your body,
through your very consciousness --
51832: -- And you emerge on the very edge of space. Reeling, you fight for
balance. For a stretched instant you think of falling, but finally you regain
equilibrium, to find yourself cowering on a narrow ledge, inches away from an
endless pit.
52039: The glass feels slick under your fingers, but nothing else happens.
52127: The window, dirty and scratched, is open.
52158: The window, dirty and scratched, is closed.
52207: Outside, it is an autumn evening, dusk creeping in and the light growing
dim.

The main campus lies to the east, up a steep hill. A short piece of roof
covers the porch, with a leaf-crowded gutter.
52375: Through the window you see the inside of your room.
52439: With a grunt and a heave, you manage to lift it open.
52483: The window slams shut, nearly bashing your fingers.
52541: Try as you might, you can't do it. It must be jammed in the frame.
52598: You smash the glass, driving your arm through the pane. A splinter of
window slashes its way up your arm and through an artery. A slow cold seeps
through your body, and you fall, slowly, away from the world...
52752: Through the window, you see other houses, and beyond those, the athletic
fields.
52818: Gratefully, you crawl back inside.
52847: The window is closed.
52866: You come out of the closet.
53113: You shiver as you remove the jacket.
53169: The jacket pockets are empty.
53259: Putting a lit torch in the jacket somehow strikes you as a bad idea.
53313: You can't put the jacket in its own pocket!
53350: There is a light switch next to the stairs.
53414: This room is used for storage: cardboard boxes bleeding onto the floor,
rusty flat-tired bikes, and other junk dating to the distant past.
53520: A cluttered desk rests in a cramped corner.
53556: The desk has been moved away from the wall.
53594: The desk belongs to the janitors, who come down here every six months or
thereabouts. Papers and clutter cover most of it. You leaf through them
quickly, but don't find anything interesting.
53734: There's about a six-inch gap between the desk and the wall.
53779: There's about an eighteen-inch gap between the desk and the wall.
53850: You manage to tug the desk another foot away from the wall, revealing a
dark hole!
53909: You can't move the desk any further; it seems to be stuck.
53991: The gap isn't wide enough to see anything.
54022: Behind the desk you can see a dark hole in the wall.
54089: around you as you enter. A sense of speed, and distance, and a curious
pain all surge through you, and then --
54219: -- Then you are elsewhere. Sun makes you squint, and you hear the crash
of surf, shrills of gulls, and all around there is loss.
54440: falls into the shaft, away from sight. You listen, but never hear it
strike bottom.
54568: It is too cold to move. You curl up, shivering, on the cold metal of the
ledge. Everything grows black, and warm, and peacefully quiet...
54680: Your whole body is shivering with the cold.
54759: You're starting to feel the ache of the cold.
54802: It's pretty cold in here.
54826: You find yourself carrying something you weren't before.
54878: You clamber down the rungs.
54908: You notice that a thin horizontal line runs around the shaft between the
levels.
54974: You crawl up the rungs to the next level.
55010: You clamber further down the rungs.
55044: Another line runs around the shaft, separating the levels.
55094: You crawl up the rungs to the next level.
55134: It's a long way down.
55156: Your voice echoes weirdly up and down the shaft.
55274: You hold your breath and squeeze into the crack. For a terrifying
second, you think you are trapped -- but you manage to push through to the
other side.
55402: You hold your breath and squeeze into the crack. For a terrifying
second, you think you are trapped -- but you manage to push through to the
other side.
55520: You can't fit through the crack carrying anything.
55563: The crack has widened, and permits easy movement.
55600: The crack is absurdly narrow; you don't see how you'll fit.
55671: You manage to roll the wheel into the crack and through.
55735: You manage to roll the wheel into the crack and through.
55794: You manage to shove the rod through the crack.
55850: You manage to shove the rod through the crack.
56007: Something must have been jarred outside, for the crack is now entirely
too narrow.
56071: The crack has widened with all the movement, and you fit through easily.
56131: You squeeze through the crack again, and again, you are almost trapped.
But you make it, and breathe a sigh of relief.
56230: You squeeze through the crack again, and again, you are almost trapped.
But you make it, and breathe a sigh of relief.
56319: You can't fit through the crack carrying anything.
56378: The control panel has three dials on it.
56503: As you set the final dial to zero, the control panel sparks!  Smoke
pours from the edges and a series of coughing explosions can be heard behind
the panel.

Meanwhile, you feel the room shift around you, as if it were moving
somehow. Then there is a deep click -- the sound of something settling, with a
grateful finality -- and all is silent.
56772: None of the dials will move.
56875: The dial seems to be stuck.
56982: You feel a sense of great weight above you.
57033: The sphere radiates cold. Your hand slips through its surface for a
moment, and you jerk it back.
57115: The sphere expands around you, hungrily, as you enter it. For a second
you understand what nothing really means, as you are annihilated, your
existence forgotten. Then something -- or someone -- creates you again, and you
are pulled to somewhere --
57348: -- You scrape your knees as you fall. Wind caresses your face, and the
smell of dry grass fills your breath. It is a summer afternoon, and you are
sitting on the side of an empty road.
57513: -- Then you are elsewhere. Sun makes you squint, and you hear the crash
of surf, shrills of gulls, and all around there is loss.
57702: Something has been added to your inventory.
57751: You hear the cries of gulls, and the pounding of surf.
57794: The trail dips down gently here, through wildflowers and scrub, as it
continues to the northeast. The air is sweet with late-spring warmth. A
weathered frame of wood stands by the side of the path, with weeds enshrouding
its base.
57964: You have uncovered a hole underneath the frame.
58006: The frame consists of four posts, arranged in a two-foot square. Four
two-by-fours connect the posts at their tops. A metal rod runs through holes in
two of the two-by-fours. One end of the rod is bent to form a handle.
58177: A segment of rope, three feet long, dangles from the rod.
58225: A long rope has been tied to the rod, and lies coiled underneath.
58281: A long rope has been wound up around the rod.
58321: A long rope has been tied to the shorter segment of rope. The excess
coils up on the ground.
58395: A long rope has been tied to the shorter segment of rope. The two have
been wound up around the rod.
58533: The long rope, tied to the shorter rope, dangles down a hole underneath
the frame.
58621: You find a hole in the ground, under the center of the frame.
58666: You find nothing further.
58701: The rod, though rusted, is still sturdy.
58749: You turn the rod a few times. It creaks, and rust rains down into the
weeds.
58814: You turn the rod, and wind the long rope up around it.
58892: You turn the rod, and unwind the long rope into the hole.
58938: You turn the rod, and unwind the long rope.
58981: You turn the rod, and wind the ropes up around it.
59057: You turn the rod, and unwind the ropes into the hole.
59101: You turn the rod, and unwind the ropes.
59155: You turn the rod, and wind the rope back out of the hole.
59221: You turn the rod, and wind the ropes back out of the hole.
59296: You turn the rod, and unwind the long rope into the hole.
59369: You turn the rod, and unwind the ropes into the hole.
59419: The rope is tied tightly to the rod. Its other end is frayed, as if cut
with a dull instrument.
59491: The rope is about three feet long. One end is frayed, as if cut with a
dull instrument.
59566: It's tied to the rod.
59595: With some effort, you untie the rope from the rod.
59650: The rope is already tied to the rod.
59683: You tie the rope back around the rod.
59803: The light bar fades to black as it falls.
59834: As you bring the light bar near the hole, you notice that it flickers
and fades. Maybe it wouldn't be a good idea to drop it down there.
59974: You feel around in the dark hole, and find something:
60096: The light bar is out of your reach.
60134: You untie the bar from the long rope and take it.
60188: E\rvapnYou tie the light bar to one end of the rope.
60231: That would do you no good.
60273: You untie the light bar from the rope.
60314: You leap forward off the ruins, and run north, through the tall grass of
the plains. Energy strums through your veins, and you feel nearly godlike.

All
right, just kidding. Actually, you can't go north.
60461: You can't go that way.
60482: About fifteen or twenty feet of good, sound rope.
60524: The light bar is tied to one end of the rope.
60583: The rope is tied to the metal rod.
60637: The rope is tied to a shorter segment of rope that dangles from the rod.
60704: It's out of your reach.
60762: It's already tied to the rod.
60815: You tie the rope to the metal rod. The end disappears into the hole in
the ground.
60892: You tie the rope to the metal rod. The other end coils up on the ground.
60974: It's already tied to the old rope.
61031: You tie the rope to the shorter segment. The end of the long rope
disappears into the hole in the ground.
61124: You tie the rope to the shorter segment. The other end of the long rope
coils up on the ground.
61206: You tie the light bar to one end of the rope.
61286: You untie the light bar from the rope.
61322: It's not tied to anything.
61367: You untie the rope from the rod.
61400: You untie the rope from the rod, unwinding it first.
61447: You untie the rope from the shorter rope.
61486: You untie the rope from the shorter rope, unwinding it first.
61539: You untie the rope from the rod and pull it up out of the hole.
61594: You untie the rope from the shorter rope, pulling it up out of the hole.
61655: You untie the rope from the rod, unwinding it first.
61702: You untie the rope from the shorter rope, unwinding it first.
61768: The light bar flickers, and grows dimmer.
62002: You stumble around in the dark, but get nowhere.
62043: A plipping noise, like water on rock, echoes from all around.
62104: As you leave the cave, the light bar glows fitfully back to life.
62176: As you leave the cave, the light bar glows fitfully back to life.
62254: You stumble around in the dark, but get nowhere.
62301: It's out of your reach.
62355: the window, somehow. The other side is cold, and bitter: you jerk your
hand back, quickly.
62573: -- the window. A coldness washes over your body, penetrating your skin,
your cells, your very fabric of being. Then, with a jerk and a twist, you are
thrust away --
62750: -- You scrape your knees as you fall. Wind caresses your face, and the
smell of dry grass fills your breath. It is a summer afternoon, and you are
sitting on the side of an empty road.
62915: -- And you emerge on the very edge of space. Reeling, you fight for
balance. For a stretched instant you think of falling, but finally you regain
equilibrium, to find yourself cowering on a narrow ledge, inches away from an
endless pit.
63127: Again, you find yourself with something new.
63192: You grab a branch, and haul yourself up.
63234: With the grace of a squirrel, you clamber down to earth.
63286: The outcrop's shadow cools this side of the road. Across the asphalt is
a grassy field, rippled by wind.
63369: A tunnel leads south into stone.
63398: You scrabble up the outcrop.
63431: You scrabble up the outcrop.
63466: You are halfway up the outcrop. Above, it steepens and becomes
unclimbable. The air is hot up here.
63546: A tunnel now leads into the rock beneath you.
63604: You dig around in the loose rock for a while. After a few minutes, you
uncover something metallic, protruding from the rock itself.
63707: You find nothing further among the rock.
63738: A lever protrudes from the side of the outcrop.
63802: The lever moves down with a click. Immediately, the outcrop shudders:
you lose your balance and tumble down, through dust and flying rock.

When you
clamber to your feet and shake the dust from your eyes, you see that a tunnel
now leads south into the outcrop.
63994: The lever moves with a click, but nothing further happens.
64049: It's too far away.
64162: With a sigh, the torch burns down and out.
64207: You are trapped in the darkness.
64238: The torch begins to sputter and fade.
64301: You'd best wrap this up quickly.
64418: But the torch is already lit!
64441: You can't reignite the torch.
64490: The gel sticks to your fingers, but you manage to scrape some of the
wall.
64567: The device sticks in the groove for a second, then falls out.
64621: The wheel fits, but won't stay in the groove.
64747: The device fits neatly into the groove and holds fast. The machine
rumbles for a moment, but then is still.
64834: You've already put some grease in the groove.
64875: You smear some of the grease into the groove.
64957: As you push the bump, it rises from the side of the machine, and then
sinks back in. As it disappears, the groove deepens slightly.
65076: You screw one end of the rod firmly into the hub of the wheel. They fit
together seamlessly.
65158: You screw the other end of the rod into the wheel's hub. They fit
together seamlessly.
65306: You can't screw the rod to that.
65353: You screw one end of the rod into the circle. They fit together
seamlessly.
65425: You screw the other end of the rod into the circle. They fit together
seamlessly.
65521: You screw the other end of the rod into the circle. They fit together
perfectly.
65583: You can't seem to take it apart.
65629: You screw the other end of the rod into the wheel. They fit together
perfectly.
65691: You can't seem to take it apart.
65722: The device is assembled already.
65752: You can't seem to disassemble it in any way.
65790: The device has been attached to the side of the machine.
65839: As you turn the device, the machine belches to life. Smoke billows from
pipes, gears mesh, pulleys turn, and valves open and close frantically.

Then,
beams of azure light spill forth from holes in the sides of the machine. They
wash over you, bathing you in iridescence. You feel your mind slipping away,
into a trance-like state, a stupor, sleep...
66313: The device is assembled already.
66343: You can't seem to disassemble it in any way.
66387: Outside seems much more appealing.
66417: You step outside into the fading sunlight of a dusky autumn evening.
Fallen leaves crackle underfoot, and the trees are glorious oranges and
yellows.

You shake your head: what just happened is unclear. It seems like a
dream in the last seconds before waking; but you cannot be sure. Images remain
behind, of ruins tossed aside like blocks, and eternal descending....

Never
mind, you tell yourself firmly, and set off towards campus. Maybe some of your
friends are here early.
66811: At the moment, even the simplest questions confuse you.
66985: It is now pitch dark. I wouldn't wander around if I were you.
67035: You stumble down a slope and break your neck!
67122: Some amusing things to try in OF FORMS UNKNOWN include:

     Going any
direction but down from the tree.
     Typing CHEAT or WIN.
     Using magic
words, such as XYZZY or PLUGH.
     Going north from Top of Ruins.

There may
be others, but they are left as an exercise for the player.
67375: Summer on a college campus is rarely exciting, and this year is no
exception. Your fellow students won't be returning for three more weeks, and
the endless grind of your job at the computer center is not anyone's idea of
entertainment.

Yesterday was the first of September, and autumn is moving in.
But the long drag of classes won't start for weeks. Restless would be one way
to describe your mood; bored sick would be another.

Last night, you had odd
dreams: a circle, turning endlessly, and carrying you on its back across
strange lands; yourself grown double, and dueling with cold-blazing swords; and
others, stranger yet.

Then the alarm went off, and you emerged into another
mundane day. Maybe something will come along to entertain you....
67970: There's no score in this game.
68075: Season:
68295: is written by Chis Markwyn, and is freely made available to all. It is
my entry in the 1996 Interactive Fiction Competition.
 
This is a game of
medium difficulty: clear thought and logical thinking should help you finish it
succesfully. Unclear thought and illogical thinking may be more fun, but will
get you nowhere in
68529: OF FORMS UNKNOWN.
68555: If you are really stuck, type "help" and you will be given a menu of
hints to choose from.
68779: How are you going to do that?
68806: How are you going to do that?
68854: How are you going to do that?
68878: You vent your frustrations.
68902: Not here.
69172: Hints have been disabled.
69202: Hints disabled.
69227: Once hints are disabled, they cannot be turned on again.
69268: Help has not been disabled.
69445: was begun on 24 September 1996, and finished on 14 October. It is
heavily influenced by, and indebted to, Andrew Plotkin's masterful game SO FAR,
which I finished on 23 September. Don't, however, expect it to be much like SO
FAR. In final content, it is far different.

OF FORMS UNKNOWN has a troubled
design history. Originally, it began as a game trying to emulate SO FAR:
psychological, allegorical, with a non-traditional plot. However, time
constraints from schoolwork and other responsibilities and the approaching
deadline of the contest (despite the several delays of that deadline) didn't
allow time enough for me to do what I wanted with the plot.

So OF FORMS
UNKNOWN became a standard solve-the-puzzle game. In places, this gives the game
a schizophrenic feel, and accounts for the lack of plot or motivation for the
player. Had I more time, I might have tried to repair the plot and fit it
better to the new style. But since I already did all the work for the main
puzzles, I don't want to see it go to waste. Therefore I decided to go ahead
and enter it in the competition.
70268: You'll find out.
70352: Whoops. Time for a new hint section. (No, not a very original puzzle --
but it moves the game along.)
70444: TURN ON LIGHT.
70493: Someone left a key in the gutter.
70601: Time for a new hint section!
70640: Go exploring.
70681: See the question about the alcove.
70854: Put your objects in the pockets. Then go through the crack.
71094: A-ha!
71116: ENTER THE SPHERE.
71256: Walk towards it.
71453: TURN THE ROD to lower it down the hole.
71543: There's not much else to do, besides pick things up.
71626: See the question about the frame.
71681: Try SOUTH.
71764: PULL THE LEVER.
71826: It's a nice view.
71882: Well, no, I haven't either.
72076: Now you can put the device into the groove.
72163: See the next question.
72222: Just GO EAST.
75024: Score:
75032: Moves:
75040: Time:
75048: You can't go that way.
75148: The catwalks are the only way you can move.
75180: It's a long way down.
75196: The ruins are too rough to climb.
75220: There's no way to go down.
75240: You wander through the ruins and end up where you started.
75280: Clutter and mess spread their way across the floor of your smallish room
in Wall House, just west of the main campus. A door leads south to the hall,
another west to the closet. Windows face east and north. Your desk sits against
one wall, next to the north window.
75468: The window is closed.
75488: A simple wooden desk, supplied by the generous people of the college. It
functions as a useful flat surface on which to pile things.
75628: still runs gamely. You've been working on your paper on it, in between
playing INFIDEL.
75696: Your old computer sits on the desk.
75724: A mirror hangs on the west wall, by the closet door.
75764: A black -- or is it? The color seems to shift and ripple -- smudge that
is embedded, somehow, in the glass itself.
75848: There is something distinctly odd about your image, captured in spun
glass and light. It looks disconnected from the world behind, as if it did not
belong; or, perhaps, it is the world that is out of place.
76076: The window is relatively clean and fully closed.
76112: You stand, shivering and gingerly balanced, on the roof outside of your
room. A window to the west leads back inside.
76196: The only way back is west.
76216: Your few clothes hang here dejectedly in this walk-in closet, your
room's only luxury. A bare lightbulb on the ceiling provides light.
76312: A warm jacket hangs here from a hook.
76340: Olive green, with lots of pockets, and well-lined.
76388: The peeling paint on the walls creates a elegant counterpoint to the
stained greenish carpet. Stairs lead down, and your room is north.
76484: The front door leads you east and outside, while stairs go up and down.
76536: You can't bear the thought of facing the outside world yet again.
76584: Boxes, furniture, and other clutter make this dingy basement
claustrophobic. Stairs lead up.
76650: Simple, really. One way is on, the other off.
76688: There is a light switch next to the stairs.
76720: A hole: an entrance into nothingness. It gapes, dark and inviting,
offering just enough space to enter.
76796: Nothing that's good for anything.
76820: A chipped wooden door, unpainted and rough.
76852: A closed wood door blocks your passage.
76880: The basement door stands ajar.
76904: Packed with leaves and filth; no-one seems to clean it.
76948: Metal, with a faded label reading STORAGE ROOM.
76992: Someone lost a key in the gutter.
77016: A giant shaft, over fifty feet wide. It stretches up and down beyond the
limit of vision. The walls glow, somehow, with a soft, pervasive light.
77120: You cling to the side of a vast shaft that rises and falls beyond sight.
A narrow ledge is all that keeps you from falling. Narrow catwalks running
northwest and southwest provide the only egress.
77256: The ledge here is slightly wider, and a recess in the shaft wall allows
you some range of motion. Catwalks span the shaft to the south and southeast.
77360: Rungs embedded in the shaft wall lead up and down. The wall here is
scarred and pitted. To the north and northeast, catwalks run.
77452: You climb for a long time, but no more ledges appear. Eventually, the
rungs disappear, and you are forced to retreat.
77536: They seem sturdy, embedded as they are in the hard metal of the shaft.
You tug on one, and it holds.
77608: The catwalks are made from some transparent, metallic substance. They
glitter placidly in the soft light that comes from all around. At their widest,
they are a few feet across; at the narrowest, a mere handspan.
77760: The ledge is wider than any on the level above; you can almost relax.
Catwalks lead northeast and east, and rungs lead upwards.
77852: The edge of this ledge is chipped and scarred; in some places it appears
almost melted. You can scramble over the catwalks to the southwest and
southeast.
77960: Worn metal rungs go downwards here. Catwalks stretch to the northwest
and west.
78016: These catwalks are made of dull metal, hard-edged and solid. They
stretch across the shaft, a uniform two feet in width.
78104: The rungs lead up and down from this ledge. You can take the catwalks to
the north and northwest.
78172: The rungs go down forever, it seems. You tire and climb back to the
ledge.
78228: This ledge is the widest you have seen, with nearly enough room to lie
down on. Catwalks go to the south and southwest.
78312: The walls of the shaft are scraped smooth here, though unpolished.
Catwalks lead away both northeast and southeast.

A narrow passage -- not much
more than a crack -- leads west.
78440: It's a long way down.
78456: The catwalks are made from polished marble, and stretch in elegant arcs
across the depths. They are breathtakingly narrow, perhaps three finger-widths
across.
78568: This tiny alcove, not more than a few feet in diameter, is cramped to an
extreme. You feel almost buried alive. The only exit is a narrow crack running
east.
78680: A control panel of some sort is embedded in the west wall.
78720: The control panel is black and burnt-out.
78752: The panel has been charred and warped; none of the dials will move.
78800: You stand on what appears to be the bottom of the shaft. Above, the
walls stretch to the vanishing point and beyond. There seems to be no way up. A
wide crack leads west, and a ladder leads down into a hole.
78948: A dim passageway stretches out of sight to the east. There is a ladder
here, leading up.
79012: The passage from the west ends here in a perfectly square room. The
walls and angles have been worked until they are near-perfect.
79104: In contrast, a dead black sphere floats dead-center.
79144: The sphere seems to suck in light. It is absolutely black, as if denying
the very possibility of light, or brightness, or color.
79234: Waves crash endlessly against the beach far below as you stand on the
edge of a cliff, looking out across the steel-gray ocean to the west. Headlands
stretch to the north along the shore, and a structure of some sort, built of
great stones, rests on the furthest. A trail winds northerly towards the
structure, and a treacherous path leads down to the shore.

Birds wheel about,
overhead the structure.
79520: Sea gulls, you think.
79536: The ocean stretches endlessly to the west, always rolling towards you.
79588: The weeds are tall, and hide the ground around the frame.
79628: The rod is half an inch in diameter. It has been rusted by wind and
rain.
79684: It's a long, narrow shaft that leads as far down as you can see.
79732: A trail from the southwest ends here at the base of a gently steepening
hill, rising to the northwest. The top of the ruined structure -- for you can
now see it is indeed in ruins -- peeks over the top of the hill; the sun glows
behind it, casting odd shadows across the land.
79928: Clouds pearl the sky above. The hills continue to the north; on the next
the ruins loom. A trail winds back downward and southeast.
80024: The ruins before you stretch towards the sky, but fail. They lie in
shambled heaps, as if toppled by great tremors, or wrecked by war. Amazingly,
an archway still stands, beckoning to the northwest.
80172: They hint at the shape of a fortress; oddly familiar, as if you had seen
them in a dream.
80236: Tumbled blocks of stone lie scattered all around, as if left here by
some careless child. Paths wind through them in many directions, and an arch
leads out to the southeast.
80356: A path from the north meets a path from the northeast here. Three
blocks, stacked in an arch, create a shadowed recess to the south.
80448: The recess is too small to enter.
80472: The hole is dark, and only a foot or so wide.
80504: It is a thin bar of some strange glowing substance; hard to the touch,
yet flexible. It casts pale light in a ring around you.
80596: You stand in the middle of an east-west junction. The ruins look
climbable to the north.
80660: The path dead-ends here in a cramped cul-de-sac. The only way back is
west.
80716: The stone is uneven beneath your feet, and you must steady yourself to
keep your balance. North, a plain stretches to the horizon, curving west around
the ocean.
80828: A coil of rope has been left here on the stone.
80864: The tips of breakers tickle your toes as you squish through the sand.
The sun gleams purple-red off the crests of waves. The beach stretches far to
the south; to the north you can just make out a cave, or hole, in the side of
the cliff.
81032: You walk for a while, but don't get much of anywhere.
81072: The endless ocean stands in your way.
81100: Darkness filters from the cave before you and casts a pall over this
sliver of beach. A cliff rises nearly vertical above you.
81188: Into the cave or south; those are your options.
81224: Dim light filters in through a narrow crack to the northeast; you just
might be able to squeeze through. A steady plipping noise echoes from the walls
around you, and the air is chill and damp.

You can see a glow through the
crack in the wall.
81396: A cramped bubble of air in the side of the cliff. A crack in the wall to
the south provides a way out. Above, a few haggard beams of light trickle down
from a hole in the ceiling.

A light bar, tied to a rope, dangles through the
hole above you.
81568: The hole is at least twenty feet out of your reach.
81604: It dangles through the hole.
81628: Impossibly, an opaque window floats here in mid-air.
81668: A simple wooden frame encloses a sheet of black glass. The glass
distorts the light, like old stained glass, or oil on a pond.
81756: A four-lane road, split in two by a wood-and-metal divider, runs
northeast to southwest here. You stand on the north side, on a narrow strip of
grass. A grassy field, dotted by trees, lies behind you. The other side of the
road is bordered by a steep outcrop.
81940: The road continues on for quite a ways, and you don't get much of
anywhere.
81996: The road climbs a steep hill to the southwest. You consider climbing it,
but turn back.
82060: Grass and weeds surround you with the dry smell of a summer afternoon.
Insects buzz and chirp invisibly around you. A road passes by to the south, and
a tall tree breaks the field just northwest.
82196: The field runs on forever.
82216: A wild oak, branches all a-twist, spreads its shade over this small part
of the field. To the south, a road wends its way through the land.
82316: The road is back to the south.
82340: You sit on a wide branch of the oak, some ten or so feet off the ground.
To the south, you can see the road. It runs to the horizon to the northeast,
and climbs a hill to the southwest. The field stretches all around.
82492: You can't climb any higher.
82512: Down seems more likely.
82532: Old and wild, the tree stands sturdily amidst the lesser vegetation.
82580: Fossiliferous limestone, you think. It looks climbable.
82620: The asphalt is cracked and potholed. Waves of heat shimmer in the
mid-day sun.
82676: The divider splits the road in two. The wood has begun to splinter and
the metal to rust, but it is still sturdy.
82756: The outcrop is too steep above you.
82784: Fossiliferous limestone, you think. Your feet slip on the loose rock,
and you are constantly forced to shift your balance, or fall.
82876: It's a metal lever, a few inches long and a quarter of an inch wide. It
seems to be embedded deep in the solid rock of the outcrop.
82968: The field across the road stretches to the horizon. Trees spread above
the grass, their branches moving with the wind.
83052: This small tunnel leads south through damp rock, and north to sunlight.
83104: A torch burns here on the wall.
83128: Steps, rudely carved from the stone, lead down. A narrow passage winds
off to the east.
83192: A nondescript little room off the main tunnel. The only way out is west.
83244: Some greasy gel sticks to the walls.
83272: Thick and opaque, it looks sticky.
83300: Out of place is the best term to describe this room. A vast machine
fills most of this high cavern. You can slip around it to the southeast or
southwest.
83408: Behind the machine, there is a little more space, and you can breathe
more easily.
83468: There is a shallow groove on this side of the machine.
83508: It's a circle nearly a foot in diameter and a half-inch deep. There is a
bump in its center.
83576: It just pokes out of the side of the machine.
83608: A riot of tubes, wires, gears, pulleys and valves, all thrown together
as if by some mad mechanic. You have no idea what it's supposed to do, or even
how it works. You can tell, however, that it no longer functions, for it merely
squats in the cavern like a carcass.
83796: A thin wheel, perhaps a foot in diamter, wrought of some light but tough
metal. Four spokes run from a central hub to the outside.
83888: The hub is threaded clockwise.
83912: The spokes radiate from the hub at ninety-degree angles, dividing the
wheel neatly into quadrants.
83980: The rod is made of strong steel. Both ends are threaded clockwise.
84032: This odd device consists of a metal circle (threaded clockwise) from
which four hinged dowels stretch.
84104: A solid piece of metal, grooved with threads on the interior.
84148: Carved from a light-colored wood, and linked to the circle with tiny
metal hinges.
84206: A thin wheel, wrought of some light but tough metal. Four spokes run
from a central hub to the outside.

A steel rod has been screwed into the hub.
84314: This odd device consists of a metal circle (threaded clockwise) from
which four hinged dowels stretch.

A steel rod has been screwed into the
circle.
84428: The construction consists of a steel rod joining a metal wheel to a
smaller metal circle. Four dowels descend from the circle to the wheel, where
they fit into previously unnoticed slots.
84560: The front door leads you east and outside, while stairs go up and down.
84612: Yourself; but beyond that, all is unclear.
84848: That Time will come and take my love away.
84902: "Help" will give you a menu of topics to choose from, including clues as
well as general information about the game. (But you should know that already
if you're reading this.) "Help off" will disable hints for the remainder of the
game.

"About" or "info" gives a general overview of the game.

"Quotes on" or
"quotes" will enable the printing of the boxed quotations that pop up every so
often. "Quotes off" turns them off. By default, they are on.
85228: Several people deserve to be thanked here: Julian Arnold, Andrew
Plotkin, and Greg Falcon, who provided me with answers to my naive questions on
rec.arts.int-fiction; Graham Nelson, for writing such a wonderful program as
Inform; my girlfriend, Nicole Maxwell, for not making fun of me; and the whole
crowd on r.a.i-f, who I first encountered three years ago, and kept my love for
these games alive.

Bugs were reported by Carl Muckenhoupt.

85808: Why don't you ask the game?
85828: Examine it closely.
85844: Strange mirror, eh?
85860: Maybe you could clean off that smudge...
85892: Interesting. Look at the mirror again.
85920: The smudge has moved. Try cleaning it again.
85952: What usually turns on lights in a house?
85980: There should be a key somewhere.
86004: Check out the windows in your room.
86032: Have you looked at the desk?
86052: There's a gap between it and the wall.
86080: Maybe there's something behind it.
86108: Try moving the desk.
86124: Aha! There's a strange hole.
86148: Try entering it.
86160: In a shaft, evidently.
86180: They seem to demarcate the levels.
86204: Maybe they do more than that...
86228: The crack's awfully narrow...
86252: You can't get through it if you're carrying anything.
86292: There are two solutions to this puzzle.
86320: Maybe you could push something through?
86348: Try ROLLing or PUSHing objects through the crack.
86388: The other solution has to do with an object from the house.
86432: It's the jacket.
86448: Have you noticed its pockets?
86472: They can hold an awful lot of stuff.
86500: Have you tried going through the crack while wearing the jacket?
86544: You can fit!
86556: Examine the panel.
86572: Do the dials make you think of anything?
86600: Do the numbers remind you of anything?
86628: Three numbers...
86672: Have you mapped out the shaft accurately?
86704: The levels are not aligned, you'll notice.
86736: Perhaps the numbers reflect that somehow.
86768: They are angles, 120 degrees apart...
86820: Could you align the levels somehow?
86848: Try changing the setting on one of the dials.
86880: Try setting the dial to 0.
86900: The shaft shakes. What could that mean?
86932: Try setting all three dials to 0.
86956: Same thing you do with the other odd things in this game.
86996: Bundle up!
87004: Slip into something nice and warm!
87028: WEAR THE JACKET.
87048: Might as well go see.
87064: Don't read on until you've been to the beach.
87100: There's a dark cave down there, and no way to light it.
87140: Have you mapped this region thoroughly?
87208: Have you looked at the base of the frame?
87240: The weeds conceal a hole.
87260: What if there were another room in the cave, directly below the frame?
87312: What if you could lower something down there to light it?
87352: Have you been to the ruins?
87372: Have you found the long rope?
87396: Have you looked in the recess?
87420: Maybe you could lower the light bar down the hole...
87460: You could tie it to the long rope.
87484: You can then tie the long rope to either the rod or the old rope.
87532: You can wander around.
87548: You can search the recess.
87568: That light bar will come in handy.
87592: Have you found the rope?
87612: Have you found a light source?
87636: You can't take the light bar into the cave.
87668: Maybe you could get it there another way...
87700: Make sure you look both ways.
87724: There doesn't seem to be much traffic.
87752: You can examine it.
87768: You can climb it.
87784: You can dig around in it.
87804: Wow, a lever!
87816: Any good adventurer knows what to do with one of those.
87856: You can examine it.
87872: You can climb it.
87888: But you can't dig it.
87904: You can play with the gel.
87924: It sure is sticky!
87940: Have you seen anywhere you could use it?
87968: Have you looked at both sides of the machine?.
88004: Have you examined the groove?
88028: Do you have anything that might fit there?
88060: Strange objects keep appearing in your inventory.
88096: They must have some purpose.
88116: Try putting the wheel in the groove.
88188: You might be able to put the objects together.
88220: Try screwing the rod to the wheel and the device.
88256: Now you're getting somewhere! Can you put the new device in the groove?
88308: No? Did you notice the bump in the middle of the groove?
88348: Did you try pushing it?
88368: The groove sinks into the machine. Interesting.
88404: Have you put the machine in working order?
88436: Maybe you could do something with the device.
88468: It is a wheel, after all.
88488: Try turning it.
88500: Well, you're back in your house.
88524: Try moving around.
88540: A walk outside does sound nice, doesn't it?
