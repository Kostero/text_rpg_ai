60724: That's plainly inedible.
60757: Not bad.
60773: That was a rhetorical question.
60801: This dangerous act would achieve little.

61333: Oh, don't apologise.
61355: Real adventurers do not use such language.
61391: Quite.
61403: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
61437: There's not enough water to swim in.
61469: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
61503: You can't usefully blow that.
61581: No, you can't set that to anything.
61644: But you aren't holding that.
61709: It is fixed in place.
61731: You are unable to.
61751: That would be less than courteous.
61776: Nothing obvious happens.
61805: Is that the best you can think of?
61835: That's not a direction.
61854: Not that way you can't.
61904: You achieve nothing by this.
61935: Futile.
61942: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
61991: You talk to yourself a while.
62014: This provokes no reaction.
62042: There is no reply.
62062: Nothing is on sale.
62108: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
62146: Time passes.
62162: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
62578: THEATRE was designed and written by Brendon Wyber. However, THEATRE
would not have come to existence without the efforts of several people.
62689: Graham Nelson created the Inform compiler, which is the text adventure
game development system used to create this game. Because Inform is such an
integral part of the game system Graham gets co-author credits, but please
don't bother him with problems about the game itself, it wasn't his fault.
62900: Theatre was valiantly beta-tested by Paul Janzen, Michael Kinyon, J.
Larios, Paul Lebeau, Mike Oliphant, Andrew C. Plotkin, Gareth Rees, Steve
Salter, Richard Scipione, Andy Smith, Stephen Van Egmond, and The Adder.
63075: "Post-release debugging" was performed by Richard Barnett, Bozzie,
Robert A. DeLisle, Robert M. Dickau, Paul David Doherty, Martin Dunstan, Jason
Dyer, Chris Malone, Michael S. Phillips, Nyuchezuu Shampoo, Dan Shiovitz, Todd
from Virginia, Jacob Solomon Weinstein, Gerry Kevin Wilson, and many others.
63318: Mark Howell wrote the interpreter (known as ZIP) which is commonly used
to run this game.
63387: The Implementors from Infocom designed the ZMachine, which is the
standard used by Inform and Zip.
63462: And finally, Joel Furr wrote a short story on the Lyric Theatre, which
inspired this game. This story is included in the game under the topic
63597: Any comments or bug reports are always welcome. Cave Rock's internet
email address is the quickest and easiest method for contact, however a mail
address is also given.
63925: This is is the second release of THEATRE. It has been recompiled to use
the latest version of the inform library and language. This has fixed several
bugs, [and probably introduced a few more :-)]. Several corrections have been
made fixing both grammar and spelling errors as well as some bugs found in the
first release.
64160: This version contains some new responses to unanticipated inputs but
contains no new locations, puzzles, or objects.
64499: This is the first release. Enjoy!
64546: All rights reserved.
64565: The Lyric Theatre short story is Copyright (c) 1989 Joel Furr.
64620: THEATRE is copyright but permission is given for this game to be freely
distributed by any and all possible means. Note, no costs may be charged for
except for the distribution costs. In the author's opinion, if you paid for
this program and you didn't get it on a CD-Rom filled with other programs, you
have been cheated.
64853: Although this game uses the data file format of Infocom's ZMachine it
contains no code that was written by them.
64938: [When you see the "[More]" prompt (or something similar) just press any
key to continue...]
65030: is a text only adventure game. These are basically large and complex
logic puzzles presented in a form of a story in which
65124: are the central character. In Theatre you are a property developer who,
in the progress of attempting to sell an old disused theatre, leaves an
electronic pager in the basement. Later on, when you come back to retrieve it,
you become trapped by the theatre's denizens. To win you must escape, but
before you can do that you must learn its secrets.

When you play Theatre, the
computer will describe to you your surroundings and then you type in, at the
">" prompt, what you want to do, pressing return or enter when finished. No
time will pass in the game until you press return or enter, so you can take
your time deciding what to do.
65573: Since it is easiest to learn from example, what follows is a transcript
showing the typical things that can happen in a game like Theatre. Note that
this is a made up example and the following does not appear in Theatre. The
comments which appear
65887: Ly MATTER which CASe you use.
65920: Before you is Wellington House, site of the famous Red Lady ghost. You
now regret your bet to stay overnight in this miserable dump, but you couldn't
really back down in front of everyone after opening your big mouth about how
ghosts could never exist. Now you have to stay in the cold all night, with
nothing to look forward to except the inevitable break in by the others and
their lame attempts to scare you. Lets hope they bring some decent beer with
them...

66396: Weeds choke this overgrown driveway, obscuring the view of the house.
Tall trees surround you giving you an intense feeling of isolation. The
driveway winds north.
66577: Before you is Wellington house itself. Once this place would have been
very regal and grand, but now after years of neglect it is ruined. Vines cover
the house in a thick web. The large front door, leading in to the north, has a
brass knocker on it. The driveway leaves to the south.
66939: The large front door blocks you way.
67007: The large front door is locked, and you do not have the key.
67093: The door does not budge.
67153: The door look pretty solid. Violence isn't the answer.
67526: Before you is Wellington house itself. Once this place would have been

67778: You knock on the door but your knuckles produce only a soft rapping
noise.
67910: The brass knocker mades a loud and deep knocking noise that revibrates
throughout the entire house.

You can hear a noise from inside the house.
68048: Time passes...

You can hear something moving towards the door. It is
making a slithering hissing noise.
68162: Time passes...

You can hear a slithering from just behind the door.
68250: Time passes...

The front door opens and a madness-inducing mass of
tentacles and slime emerges. You are paralysed with fear and cannot even scream
as the tentacles close around you..

Version 6.66. New
players should type in HELP.
Dedicated to Level 9 Computing fans everywhere.
69056: Weeds choke this overgrown driveway, obscuring the view of the house.
Tall trees surround you giving you an intense feeling of isolation. The
driveway winds north.
69227: Before you is Wellington house itself. Once this place would have been

the house in a thick web. The large front door, leading in to the north, has a
brass knocker on it. The driveway leaves to the south.
69475: They looks rather sturdy and completely entangle the house.
69580: You are high up on the roof of Wellington house. You can see all around
you the overgrown and neglected Wellington estate. Vines lead down, while an
open window leads west.
69749: It is too dark in here to see anything.
69828: You are high up on the roof of Wellington house. You can see all around
you the overgrown and neglected Wellington estate. Vines lead down, while an
open window leads west.
70076: You are carrying a tourist's map of Paris, a flashlight, and a set of
cards.
70184: You brought these along in case you got bored.
70278: You thought this may come in handy. It is currently switched off.
70384: The flashlight emits a steady beam of light.
70459: The attic is a maze of old storage boxes and other dust covered junk. A
closed trap door leads down.

On one of the boxes rests an old bird cage.

A
cupboard sits in the corner.

A ladder rests again the wall.
70719: Old and wooden. It is currently closed.
70867: You open the cupboard, revealing an old robe, a suitcase, a umbrella,
and a small mirror. You also notice some writing on the cupboard door.
71013: "Shelter I offer, to the cursed, unlucky, or damned."
71105: Strangely, as you attempt to enter the cupboard you seem to be repelled
by a strange unseen force.
71751: Strangely, you are allowed entry now into the cupboard. As you get into
it you notice it seems quite deep. You move further into it it seems to get
even bigger and bigger until you realise it has become another place...
71923: You are in a large wooden hall....
72154: Here is a list of some of the most common and useful commands that are
used in Theatre.
72232: To move about you simple say GO and supply a compass direction, i.e. GO
NORTH. You can also GO UP and GO DOWN. ENTERing and CLIMBing things may also
move you about.
72373: Since movement is so common the current abbreviations are provided.
72648: To redisplay the current location go LOOK AROUND or L. You can also
EXAMINE objects as well as LOOK UNDER, LOOK BEHIND, and LOOK INSIDE them. Extra
descriptions may be given by LOOK UP and LOOK DOWN. Of course there are also
other senses than sight. LISTEN, TOUCH, and TASTE will also work. Other things
might require a bit of a SEARCH to uncover their secrets.
72988: Scattered about the Theatre are several objects that will help you. To
get then you simply TAKE them. Naturally when you don't want an object any more
simply DROP it. Some objects are containers which you can OPEN and CLOSE. To
see what you are carrying type in INVENTORY or I.
73205: Some objects come in containers. You can always TAKE one object FROM
another as well as PUT an item INTO a container. Other things might be so big
that you can ENTER them and others you can push from location to location with
a simple PUSH object NORTH.
73431: When you have had enough you stop the game by typing QUIT. You can also
RESTART the game from the beginning as well. However Theatre is a large game so
you may want to SAVE your current place in the game so you can RESTORE it
later. When saving a game, you will be prompted for a file name.

Saving a game
allows you to store a "snapshot" of the current game, remembering your score,
where you are, and stuff like that. Using save you can avoid having start from
scratch all the time.
73815: The parser is the computer algorithm used by the game to process what
you type in into something the game understands. Generally the game will
understand the following types of sentences.
74717: It is important to remember that you aren't talking to a real person, so
it will not understand everything. The game will generally tell you when you
have typed in something it doesn't understand, however it may misinterpret your
meaning.
74886: Below is a list of just some of the verbs it does understand.
75398: Note, this list is not complete; there are others as well.
75466: The following are special commands.
75544: BRIEF: When you first enter a location it will display its description,
but from then on, when moving about, it will not.
75637: FULL SCORE: Displays the current score, and also says where the points
come from.
75704: HELP: Displays the help menu.
75733: INVENTORY (abbreviated I): Will display what you are carrying.
75806: : Displays the current location description. All of it, regardless of
current BRIEF/SUPERBRIEF/VERBOSE mode.
75903: PROMPT: Turns the "What Now?" prompt on and off.
75948: QUIT: Quits the current game.
75977: RESTART: Restarts the game from the beginning.
76018: RESTORE: Reloads a previously saved game. You will be prompted for a
filename.
76083: SAVE: Saves the game to disk. You will be prompted for a filename.
76138: SCORE: Will display what your current score it.
76179: SCRIPT: Will start saving the actual text of the game, either saving it
to a file (in which case you will be prompted for a filename) or sending it
directly to the printer, depending on which computer you are running this game
on.
76346: SUPERBRIEF: In superbrief mode the game will not display the full
location descriptions unless you type in LOOK.
76437: TIME: Tells you what the current time it.
76474: UNSCRIPT: Will stop the computer from scripting.
76517: VERBOSE: In verbose mode the computer will display the full description
of a location when you move about. This is the default mode.
76618: VERSION: Displays the version information about the game.
76742: 1. Draw a map. It should list the location names and the objects in
them. It helps to stop you forgetting about things.
76831: 2. Pick up everything you can. It could be useful later.
76876: 3. Examine everything. Looking closer at the scenery may reveal hidden
things and clues. Don't forget you can LOOK UP and LOOK DOWN, as well as LOOK
BEHIND and UNDER things.
77021: 4. If you are really stuck you can always look at the HELP menu again.
You will notice that it will change to reflect the current state of the game.
77130: 5. Play with a friend, err, play the game with a friend. What is
difficult for you may be obvious for them.
77211: 6. The author is a big fan of secret doors. There are three near the
start. And also, what may seem to be an impassable barrier, might not be.
77316: 7. There are some things that you cannot do until you become trapped
inside the theatre. Going up the lobby stairs is just one example.
77426: You have barely begun the game! Just get the pager and leave the
theatre. It really is that simple.
77518: There are some secret areas, that are accessible, that you haven't been
to yet. Keep looking around.
77630: There are some hard to reach places that you haven't been to yet. Go
back to some places that seem blocked. They may not be that impassible.
77740: Remember. Look everywhere and take everything.
77787: Since this game is set inside and doors are everywhere, just ignore
them, unless they are given special mention.
77875: Necrophilia is not your style.
77906: Dead men tell no tales.
78027: The dead will only wait.
78051: The dead aren't big on personal possessions.
78114: This is a rather long story that inspired this game. I would recommend
that you turn on scripting with the SCRIPT command, before viewing this, so
that you can reread it more easily later on.

Do you still want to view this?
78395: I wrote this a long time ago -- a non-fiction, chatty account of a cool
old theatre. It's not immortal prose but I still get requests for it, so here's
a repost for old times' sake.
78533: The Ghosts of the Lyric:
79310: Beth had been a classmate of mine in high school, though we really
hadn't become chatting friends until after graduation. She'd married Bud
Bennett, four years her senior, in the summer of 1988 and the two of them
worked days at the Virginia Tech library and then spent Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday evenings running the theatre. They hated the necessity of spending
three evenings a week watching the meager crowds trickle in and out, but since
they worked unpaid it permitted the theatre to stay open a little while longer.
Profitable once, the days of competition with the eight-screen cineplex at the
mall and the burgeoning video-rental businesses had reduced the Lyric to the
point where the bank account balance spiralled downwards rather than creeping
upwards or staying even. Without the clout to get the must-see movies, they
showed what they could get, often having to show several also-rans as part of
the package that brought them their rare popular film.
79987: I wondered why the Kelseys kept the place open, since they knew full
well that they would never make a profit again. One day I asked. Beth explained
to me that, to be quite honest, it was only until her grandfather died. Without
the Lyric, he'd have no reason to exist; even in his advanced years he would
wander down to the theatre in the evening and poke uselessly around for a while
before leaving.
80272: Evenings spent chatting with Beth and Bud while we waited for the late
showing of whatever dubious blockbuster they had that week to finish generally
included at least a half hour of extensive complaining about the Virginia Tech
students who vandalised the building during the day, when the University leased
the space for large lecture classes. Each evening's crew would find a few new
depredations, whether it be Coca-Cola syrup emptied out onto the snack counter
floor, or wooden lap-boards shoved up under the carpet, or graffiti written on
the bathroom walls in magic marker. We called the students "ingrates" out of a
sense of irritation with the casual way they destroyed property that belonged
to people who had never done them any harm. After Beth and Bud got that out of
their systems we'd chat about life for a while, and then the movie would end
and the twenty or thirty patrons would wander out and we'd close up.
80913: I felt odd about staying after closing with them, worried that they'd
think that I had nowhere else to be, but I did enjoy talking and truth to tell
they were about the only people outside my cluster of fellow students with whom
I did get to talk on a regular basis. And it was interesting getting to go in
the places most patrons wouldn't even know existed: the back stairwell that
must have been used decades ago by black theatre-goers, the vast empty stage
behind the movie screen where once, long ago, theatrical plays had been
presented; the eerie crawlspace under the stage where no one had much desire to
explore; the boiler room with Russell's 55-gallon drum of stale popcorn; the
odd crawlspaces
82546: There were certain things that had to be done each evening and
eventually I learned them and was able to help out. They had to make sure
everyone was out of the place, then lock up. Then Bud would go up to the
projection booth and start the movie feeding off the big platter it had
collected onto and backwards onto another platter for the next showing. Or, if
the movie was being shipped out in the morning, we'd collect it into two
massively heavy movie canisters and lug it down the back stairs to the street
entrance. Beth would go down to the right-side emergency exit passage and get
the piles of wooden lap boards out for the students to use in classes the next
day, and wheel out the overhead projector and microphone and slide projector
and get them all set up. We'd take all the cups and napkins from the snack bar
and lock them in a closet so the students wouldn't fill them with soft drink
"post mix" (the syrup that gets combined with soda water to make the actual
beverage) and splash it around, as they had done back in the days when Beth and
Bud didn't know better than to leave the cups sitting out.
83315: Fortunately, the actual cleaning of the theatre was not a chore we had
to do; that was taken care of by an extremely old, senile man named Russell.
Russell came in late at night, usually long after we left, and would clean up
the spilled candy and popcorn and drinks and clean the restrooms and all the
other distasteful things that one has to do in a place frequented by sloppy
college students. Russell liked to collect things; Beth and Bud laughed
hysterically when it occurred to them to show me his fifty-five gallon drum
full of stale popcorn. Apparently he took all the leftover popcorn from the
evening's showings and collected it in the aforementioned drum which he kept in
the boiler room, a room accessed by a mostly-hidden panel located in one of the
emergency exit passageways. Beth had asked him about the drum-ful of popcorn
and Russell had told her that he saved it up for his "pups." "Pups?" Beth had
asked, and Russell had assured her that the dogs he raised for sale loved to
eat the stale popcorn. Beth never failed to go into conniptions if you
mentioned Russell's corn-fed "pups."
84084: Russell also collected used drink cups, combs, burned-out fluorescent
light tubes... assortments of all of these would turn up in closets and storage
areas and the back stairwell to eventually be thrown out by Beth or Bud or one
of the other theatre employees. Once, he had retrieved some burned-out, dusty,
singed-looking fluorescent light tubes from the garbage, had stuck them in a
box, marked the box "new," and placed them safely away in a closet for future
use. Beth and Bud eventually stopped trying to understand why he did these
things; they simply took each newly-found cache as a pleasant discovery to be
examined for possible actual usefulness and then disposed of once the diagnosis
had come up "negative." Russell never seemed to mind; in fact, he seemed to be
pleased when he noticed the absence of his prizes and would take it as an
impetus to search for new and even more interesting treasures.
84754: This narrative will shortly take a turn into a more mysterious vein, but
before I got to that part, I wanted to explain to you what kind of place the
Lyric Theatre was when I was spending some evenings there chatting with my
friends. It was a nice old place, although it was disintegrating slowly. Beth
and Bud were nice too; they were big Grateful Dead fans, frequent wearers of
tie-dyed shirts, the sort of people who I figured would always be fairly happy
no matter what they were doing. I was glad that I got to visit with them, and
happy also that I got to look around the theatre and find out about all the
little cubbyholes and dark corners that I'd never known about back when I was a
kid and attending movies there.
85265: Let me begin this part of the narrative by saying "I don't believe in
ghosts." It's almost obligatory, I think, to begin a true-life account of a
"haunting" with that disclaimer, so as to keep the reader from thinking that
they're in for another credulous narrative from an under-skeptical lunatic.
85480: I really don't believe in ghosts. I've never heard of any "documented
evidence" on the subject of ghosts that didn't turn out to be misinterpreted or
manufactured upon subsequent examination, and you'd think that if there really
were such things someone would have been able to call in scientists and settle
things for once and for all.
85715: However... (long pause, deep sigh), I do have a few stories to relate
that strike me as being pretty close to saying "If there aren't such things as
ghosts, you tell me what it was I heard that night." I present them here not as
evidence of the existence of ghosts but rather out of a desire to share my
puzzlement with the reader.
85952: At first, it didn't occur to me to be spooked about all of the old
out-of-the-way places I came across while exploring the Lyric. I was generally
not the sort of person to get myself all worked up over creaks and cold drafts,
especially when there were neat things to be looking at. I really did like
poking around, so I wasn't going to spoil things for myself by imagining
haunts.
86221: All this changed in a hurry one night when Beth and I were in the
projection booth, high above the theatre, watching Bud do what he had to do to
get the movie off the platters and back into the cans to ship out the next day.
It was a quiet night, and we'd long since shooed everyone out and locked the
doors and gotten the stuff out for the morning's classes. All that remained was
to stow the movie away and we'd split, perhaps to go over to the nearby Cellar
beer joint for a pitcher of something cold and effervescent. Then, during a
lull in the conversation, there came a loud shriek, basically what one would
expect to hear if you had a banshee close at hand, coming from just outside the
booth and over to the right hand side of the balcony. All three of us reacted
in the same way: we blinked and snapped our heads around to stare in the
direction the noise had come from.
86828: "What the hell was that?!" I asked, extremely startled by the volume of
the shriek coming from what I had every reason to believe was a completely
deserted balcony.
86947: Beth and Bud looked at each other, then at me, and then Beth shrugged,
and said "We hear things like that all the time."
87038: "What is it?" I wondered if it was some sort of equipment in the walls
rasping against something. Ever the skeptic, I was looking for a reasonable
expectation before jumping to the conclusion that it was ghosts.
87189: Bud spoke up, matter-of-factly. "We assume it's a ghost. Like, there's
no one in the theatre and even if someone had hidden in the restroom and then
snuck up here to scare us they'd have no way to get out without coming to us
and saying 'Can I get out?'" This was true, since even the emergency exits were
locked at night for reasons I wasn't sure of.
87444: Intrigued by the bland way Bud accepted the fact that a loud shriek had
come from a deserted balcony in an empty, locked theatre, I wondered what else
had happened in the past to accustom them to such things going on?
87597: "We assume that there's a woman's ghost haunting the building. Every so
often we hear her screaming from over in the direction of the ticket booth."
Beth pointed down through the floor and to the right, in the approximate
direction of both the ticket booth on the floor below and also the direction
the scream had seemed to come from. I'd thought of it as more or less on the
same floor as us, but then again it hadn't lasted long enough to stop and
triangulate its position.
87928: "No kidding," I said. "Does she ever say anything, or does she just
scream?" I was being facetious, not expecting the answer I got.
88029: "No, sometimes she says 'Let me out, let me out.'" I thought Beth was
kidding but from the look on her face, I realised that she wasn't.
88134: Now I began to get the impression that there really was more going on
here than I had originally thought. I was still mostly expecting to go
downstairs after Bud finished and find something parked out on the street that
could have made the noise we'd heard, but Beth and Bud seemed to take it as
just another odd occurrence in a string of odd occurrences. The fact that all
three of us had heard it and registered shock was another point in favour of it
being something requiring more explanation than I had handy.
88491: Bud finished his work and he and I each carried one of the heavy movie
canisters down the back stairway to the street door. On the way, we passed many
little openings stuffed full of old flyers and boxes of junk, and a door that
was nailed shut, and more boxes of junk, and an opening that led off to a dead
end, and so on down to the door. Where once I'd just poked around and wondered
what all that stuff was kept lying around for, now I was eyeing the door and
the dead-end opening with a little suspicion and a little edginess. Bud, for
all that he had much more experience with the noises, could just as well have
been walking down Main Street at high noon as using the dark, cluttered back
stairway of a haunted theatre at eleven thirty in the evening. He didn't seem
nervous or worried so I just shrugged and went on down and out to the street,
where we met Beth coming out of the main doors and locking them behind her.
89134: "Do you really hear things like that often?" I asked?
89177: They maintained that they did. For two people who had to work three
nights a week in a place where they regularly heard eerie screams late at
night, they were pretty composed, I thought.
89310: We were all fairly tired that particular night, so we didn't stick
around to discuss the "ghosts." Beth and Bud went on home and I went off home
too and mulled it over.
89433: The next night, after class, I came back and sat in the foyer with them
and we talked about the ghosts. Beth said that there were actually three or
four places within the theatre that had ghosts or ghostlike phenomena
associated with them.
89602: The first was the screaming woman, who usually just shrieked wordlessly
but sometimes screamed to be let out of wherever it was she was trapped. For
some reason, Beth and Bud focused in on the origin of the sounds; they both
went to great lengths to explain how it had seemed to come from the direction
of the ticket booth. They usually heard it when they were up in the balcony,
but one time Beth had been in the ticket booth itself, which sat just in from
the street in a large entranceway open to the weather, and had heard the
screaming coming from directly above her, from the other side of the ceiling
and perhaps coming from the rooms directly above.
90057: I asked the obvious question: did they know of anyone who'd been walled
up alive in the theatre? I asked this facetiously, of course, but their story
seemed to indicate that a spirit of a woman was trapped in some way in the
offices or ceiling above the ticket booth.
90315: Not the answer I'd expected, but it did make me stop and think. If
ghosts did haunt the place they died, it might mean that some of the
"paranormal activity" in the theatre might be caused by the ghost of that
workman.
90472: And, in fact, there were some stories that made one think again of this
workman who'd been killed there. Beth said that she sometimes heard a man
stomping around on the stairs leading up to the balcony and sometimes on the
old back steps leading from the balcony and projection booth to the street.
90679: A good place to hear and sometimes see odd things was the balcony steps,
they said. If you stood on the steps up to the balcony, still in sight of the
candy and drink station in the lobby, you could often feel a chill brush past
you and now and then you'd be able to hear and see faint mutterings and shadows
from up above.
90904: Bud had several stories concerning voices he'd heard in places where he
could definitely attest that no customers or Lyric employees had been. He said
that he had once or twice been up in the balcony and heard a voice speaking
quietly to itself down in the main seating area, in the area of seats nearest
the screen. He'd looked out from the balcony and seen absolutely no one
anywhere out in the seats, and yet here was this quiet voice speaking to
itself. With the Lyric locked up tight so no one could get out without a key,
it would have been tough for someone to hide there to fake the "ghost" and then
sneak out after Bud had left. And what would have been the point? Beth and Bud
were both so blase' about the whole mess that anyone who stayed behind in the
Lyric night after night to try to startle them would quickly have gone mad
watching Beth and Bud yawn and lock the place up and leave night after night.
91537: A similar story involved a man and woman talking in the balcony one
night when Bud was tidying up downstairs. He started up the balcony steps to
take care of the movie and heard them talking and waited a few minutes for them
to resolve their conversation and head on out. When they didn't come down past
him, he went on up and found the balcony area empty. Since the back steps
leading down to the street required one to use a key to get out of the
building, the people couldn't have gotten out, so either they had hidden
themselves in one of the dead-end passages off the back stairs or in the
crawlspace above the projection booth, neither of which sounded likely, or they
had vanished into thin air.
92094: worth stealing, but it didn't. The projectors were these massive,
far-too-heavy-to-move pieces of equipment that used carbon arcs for lighting.
Wandering into the projection booth was like wandering into a mad scientist's
workshop and if a thief had found him or herself there, the first reaction
would likely have been to curse at the junk and head for the exit. Vandalism
was by far the greater problem for the Lyric management and employees. People
would tear most anything apart if it was left out for anyone to get their hands
on the next morning. That nothing substantial ever turned up smashed or wrecked
by some "stay-laters" makes me think that some other explanation was needed to
explain the Lyric "ghosts."
92595: None was forthcoming at the time, and since Beth and Bud had no
explanation either save that it might possibly have something to do with her
great-grandfather who had spent a lot of time in the building during his life,
we went on to talk about other subjects.
92778: A few nights later, Beth and Bud were in fairly perky moods when I
dropped by, and Bud asked me if I wanted to see what was behind the screen.
92883: "Sure," I said, not really expecting anything in particular but willing
to look.
92946: Once we had closed up, Bud led the way to the right-hand emergency exit
passageway and opened a locked panel a few feet above the floor in the
left-hand wall. Beth hopped up, and then I climbed up, and Bud followed. We
were behind the screen, in the vast emptiness of the old stage. It was fairly
dark but Bud turned on a few lights that revealed just how large it all was.
High above us, if you turned to look, there were openings that led into rooms,
or something, but there was no way to get to them. I pointed and asked and Beth
told me that those were the old dressing rooms, used when the theatre had
offered stage productions. The stairs and catwalks that led to the dressing
rooms were long gone. Bud said he had been up and in them, finding nothing all
that exciting to look at, but I didn't think to ask how he'd gotten up there
because he was leading us over to another locked panel, this one in the floor
of the stage near the middle of the screen.
93615: Bud opened the panel, and looking down into the opening, I saw just
blackness. Bud said that if you jumped down you'd find yourself in a tunnel
leading along underneath the stage.
93744: "Hmm," I said, for some reason none too enthusiastic about jumping down
into a pitch-black tunnel leading into the bowels of a darkened theatre.
93849: "A friend and I once got some flashlights and went down there. It was
spooky as hell." Bud placed a great deal of emphasis on the phrase "spooky as
hell." I could see why. It was dark down there. "We crawled down the tunnel
until we got to this grate. It felt cold. Like there was something just beyond
it waiting for someone to come through." Anticlimactically, he finished, "We
got the hell out of there."
94144: "Why don't you shut the hatch?" I suggested?
94183: Beth grinned at me and Bud shut the hatch.
94218: Once it was shut, Bud pointed out that the old orchestra pit was still
down under the theatre. If you stood in the front row of seats, there was a
semicircular area of floor between the seats and the screen where the old pit
had been covered over. Bud theorised that the tunnel beneath the stage might
well have led to the covered-over orchestra pit; the grate might have been the
entrance to the pit. We had just been talking about the voices in the seats
that Bud had heard one night, and I think we all started to wonder if there
might have been any connection between the voices and what I privately thought
of as the "malevolent force" beyond that grate. Perhaps someone was buried
under the floor in the old orchestra pit. Once our thoughts started down that
avenue we could keep coming up with new ways to scare ourselves, so we got out
of there and locked the stage access panel back.
94835: Before we left that night, Bud showed me the boiler room, located
beneath the stage and accessed through a panel at the back of a little niche
that seemed made for a garbage can to sit in, there in the emergency exit
corridor. That was when I found out about Russell's popcorn. The drum was
three-quarters full and a whole stack of empty, soiled popcorn tubs was sitting
next to it. I wondered how an aged man such as Russell would be able to get the
drum of popcorn out when the time came to take it off to feed to his "pups."
Perhaps he emptied it into smaller containers. One might never know. One day
the popcorn would be there and the next night it would be gone.
96001: I climbed back up and past the stack of records and looked over a low
wall of cinder blocks where the projection booth wall continued on up past its
ceiling, and looked out over the top of the theatre. In the dim vastness of the
theatre, I could see metal struts and beams, all supporting the weight of the
ceiling and lighting, and far across the theatre, at the stage end, I could see
a catwalk of some sort. Once I'd noticed it I could see it running back toward
me, stopping part-way across. I assumed that it might have been there for
changing of lights or something. For some reason, though, my imagination
started to click, wondering who or what might be out there on the catwalk.
Before I knew it I was half-imagining something coming along the catwalk toward
me, something headless and dark. I ducked back down and into the projection
booth, having actually seen nothing but having managed to spook myself
considerably nevertheless.
96656: Back down in the balcony after we left the projection booth, I asked Bud
what was on the other side of a door that one could see in the balcony wall,
half-blocked by chairs and painted over. I'd asked this before but forgotten
his answer. He replied that it led to the offices, he thought, although he
didn't remember which office had a door that didn't go anywhere. I'd never been
up in the Lyric offices, which looked out over the theatre marquee, since there
wasn't any way to get from the Lyric proper into them. You had to go out to the
street, down past Carol Lee Donuts, and back in another entrance that led to a
stairway and up to the offices. Bud said he'd take me up there sometime. It was
nothing all that exciting, he said, but I just wanted a look around.
97199: So, a couple of weeks later, I asked Bud if he'd show me around up
there, since he'd just gotten through telling Beth that he'd come in early the
next afternoon to set up a new movie. He said "Sure, come on by and we'll go
look." So, I did. I found Bud up in the projection booth, about five thirty in
the afternoon. He left what he was doing and we went back out to the street and
up to the offices. The offices themselves were pretty humdrum, typical dusty
old offices with pictures and things from Beth's father's high school days and
even further back than that. Bud then showed me the rest of the rooms, after
having showed me each of the offices. We went into a storeroom full of junk,
passing right by another door as we went. I stopped and opened the door we'd
passed by.
97752: Dark. That was my first reaction. The hallway was none too well lit and
the room beyond the door was not lit at all. More than that, it seemed to be
full of a kind of inky blackness. I kid you not when I say that I felt a kind
of awareness in the room. I was still standing there, staring worriedly into
that room with the hair on the back of my neck standing up, when Bud came back,
having noticed I was not following behind him. "Joel, I would close that door."
I closed it.
98093: I looked at Bud and said "Ack." He nodded and said "I know. That was why
I passed that door by."
98170: I looked at him, then at the door.
98199: "Wow," was all I could say.
98226: We poked around a little more, but it really wasn't that impressive a
place; it was just a set of offices with old movie schedules and projector
parts and boxes of cups sitting around. Except for the Door.
98373: When we left and went back into the theatre, I was thinking furiously.
For one thing, that room was just precisely situated to be on the far side of
the painted-shut door in the balcony wall. For another, it was more or less
right above the ticket booth. For a third, it seemed alive, or perhaps dead
would be a better way of putting it. Well, whatever it added up to, I left the
theatre that day certain that I would not go into that room for any amount of
money. Not unless I had about six floodlights and a Bible and a crucifix and
about six gallons of holy water with me. I don't know what works against ghosts
but I was fairly sure one was in there and that was good enough for me.
99690: tried to keep the Lyric open, using the old Lyric staff who'd worked for
Beth and Bud and the Kelseys, but even with staff that knew the operation there
was just no way you could make money at it. Even without having to pay
themselves rent, the amount that they had to make to pay off the movie
distribution companies each week before they could make any profit was way more
than they could take in each week. Eventually the Lyric closed its doors for
good and wound up being used only when Virginia Tech needed it for some reason.
The Virginia Tech Union showed films there for a while (even going so far as to
sell the incredibly stale candy that had been left over from when the Kelseys
had owned it) but when the student center on campus re-opened that was it.
100221: Since the Lyric occupies the center of a block, with apartments above
parts of it and stores all around it, no one can just go in and demolish it and
build something on the site. So until someone comes up with the money to gut
the insides and put something else there, or comes up with the wherewithal to
restore the theatre and use it for theatrical productions or something people
would come to, the Lyric will remain closed and shuttered, with only its ghosts
for company.
101046: Another birthday has come, and this time Mother has given me this
diary, probably an attempt on her part to encourage my writing habits. I do
promise to correspond with her, now that I am leaving for the City.
101198: My salvation has come, in the unexpected form of Trent. He saw the more
involved changes I had made when he visited the building site. Apparently,
despite Horton's death, they are still building that damned theatre. Later on,
he broke into the Horton estate and he saw
101430: He has told me to return home to Melissa and my family and to forget
that this ever happened. I shall do this.

Farewell, my diary, I am about to
give you to Trent. He has promised me that he will throw this chronicle into
the foundations of the theatre and that he shall see that Elizabeth will not
survive to see her theatre completed.

I shall return to my true love,...
     
    ...Melissa.
101752: The page is from a journal with these entries:
101792: The pages form a journal with these entries:
102092: You have no time to explore what lies up the stairs.
102128: Your pager lies down in the basement.
102163: Just leave, now that you have the pager, or you will be late meeting
the others.
102211: Just get the pager and get to the opera.
102258: A quick check determines that the thug is still out there.
102303: You are not leaving without your pager.
102330: Actually, this room is two stories high. You can see a landing going
around the walls. The staircase goes to this landing.
102414: A circular window is in the southern wall above the theatre doors.
102454: The southern wall above the theatre doors in shrouded in darkness.
102503: There is nothing but dust behind the posters.
102569: Did you read the introduction?
102599: You have to find your pager.
102625: You left it in the basement. Type in compass directions to move about.
102734: Just get the pager and then leave.
102758: You have found what you came for, so just leave.
102785: No car? Better get back into the theatre is see if you can get some
help from inside.
102838: Once, people would have hung up their coats and hats here, but now the
hooks lining the walls are home only for cobwebs.
102912: One particular hook is cleaner than the others.
103029: You can't go that way.
103087: You pull a couple of the hooks at random but nothing seems to happen.
103203: A secret passage opens, leading down. Hmm, this is great, you can slap
a couple of grand onto the price tag.
103282: The passage opens, again.
103309: The passageway closes.
103384: You have no time to explore what lies down the secret passage.
103426: Your pager lies down in the basement.
103459: Just leave, now that you have the pager, or you will be late meeting
the others.
103507: Just get the pager and get to the opera.
103538: Judging from the desk and lots of papers everywhere, this must have
been the manager's office.
103598: Doors lead to the southeast and to the north.
103637: Doors lead to the southeast and to the north, while a hole in the wall
leads south.
103691: Doors lead to the southeast and to the north.

The southern wall has
been plastered over.
103757: G.

The desk has an open drawer containing
103828: You have no time to explore what is north of here.
103864: Your pager lies down in the basement.
103899: Just leave, now that you have the pager, or you will be late meeting
the others.
103947: Just get the pager and get to the opera.
104035: You go to pick up the papers but decide not to bother in the end, they
are just too boring.
104090: The desk, like the rest of the office, is covered in papers. However,
you do notice it has
104146: Pma closed drawer.
104288: This is a small old-fashioned safe with a dial and a handle on it.
104346: Hmm, perhaps if you turn the dial, you might hear something.
104389: The safe is locked.
104417: The markings on the dial are all worn away. The dial turns quite freely
104636: Click... Click... Click... Clunk...
104679: Click... Click... Click... Click... Click... Clunk...
104735: Click... Click... Click... Click...
104770: The dial clicks faintly as you turn it to the left.
104831: Click... Click... Clunk...
104881: Click... Click... Click... Clunk... Rumble...

The door swings open.
Looking inside the safe you can see
105004: . The safe door swings shut, seemingly of its own accord.
105044: Click... Click... Click... Click...
105079: The dial clicks faintly as you turn it to the right.
105130: The plans are for the front end of the theatre. Commissioned by Nelson,
Meldrew, and Grahams in 1955, they covered an extension to the front of the
theatre
105226: . Strange, according to the plans, there is a ticket booth to the south
of the office
105304: to ihn
Actually, looking closer at the wall, you can see where the
southern wall has been plastered over. Hmm, you would never have been able to
spot it if you hadn't looked at the plans.
105480: It was through here that you left your pager.
105547: The plaster has been broken and an exit leads south.
105580: The southern wall has been roughly plastered-over.
105624: You have already done enough damage!
105655: You are not going to start ruining the building without a good reason.
105701: The plaster breaks away leaving an exit to the south. You recoil away,
as a pocket of rotten-smelling air is expelled from the newly formed opening.
105793: An aroma of rotting flesh emits from the hole.
105827: To see whats inside just go south.
105866: Well, if the markings on the dial have warn away then you couldn't open
it even if you had the combination.
105938: So, it looks like you will have to break into it. In the movies bank
robbers traditionally used dynamite. However, that would probably be a little
hard to come by here.
106050: In spy movies, however, sometimes safe crackers used a little more
finesse.
106147: They are too dirty to see through.
106177: You try to polish the windows but it is ineffective. Most of the dirt
must be caked on from the outside anyway.
106251: You would never fit through them.
106281: The electrical panel is mounted on the wall. On it you can see a
switch. The switch is
106460: display. This particular model was designed for long range and
durability, which is just as well considering all the things that you have done
to it.
106556: At the moment it has no message on the display.
106585: Currently a message flashes across the display...

         Hurry up,
slow coach! The Opera is about to start!
106682: You give a little jump of fright as suddenly your pager emits a series
of high pitched beeps.
106751: If you want some popcorn just take it.
106868: It's the type of switch that you turn off or on, not push or pull.
106919: You turn the switch on. It emits a low hum but nothing special seems to
have happened.
106977: You turn the switch off. It stops humming.
107011: Hmm, it is bland and flavourless. Still it is surprisingly crunchy.
107100: You are carrying enough popcorn as it is.
107195: You scoop up the popcorn (there is plenty more in the barrels).
107237: You scoop up the popcorn.
107263: Sorry, the rest of the popcorn is congealed into a large mass.
107306: The neighbourhood outside the theatre has deteriorated steadily over
the last three decades, to the state of a slum (not that you would ever use
that word, of course). Now a slight mist covers the litter-strewn streets. The
street heads east and west into the murky twilight.
107470: You stop for a moment. Something is wrong with this scene. Your car is
missing. Your car is not here. Your car is gone. There is a big space where
your car was once parked. It's absent, vanished, vacated the premises,
disappeared, ... stolen. Someone has stolen your car! How typical, in order to
save an annoying little pager, fate has robbed you of your car. That car has
been part of your life for years and now it is gone. It looks like you could be
late for the opera, after all.
107774: Unfortunately, your car has not miraculously reappeared.
107833: You retreat into the theatre.
107859: Great, now you are trapped in the theatre. Perhaps there is a phone
somewhere here.
107928: As you start to head back into the theatre you smell something
unpleasant and then hear laughter behind you.

You stop and turn around. 
Before you stands a nasty-looking thug wielding a sharp knife.
108061: The thug blocks your path.
108083: Not in this neighbourhood! Perhaps something back inside the theatre
could help you.
108145: The thug blocks your path.
108167: Not in this neighbourhood! Perhaps something back inside the theatre
could help you.
108227: What an entirely perverse and unpleasant idea!
108268: The only treat the thug is after seems to involve you and that rather
sharp little knife he has.
108333: It would be foolish to provoke him.
108363: The thug mumbles some obscenities back at you.
108403: The thug obviously has a poor choice in cologne.
108439: The thug is rambling on. It is difficult to make out what he is saying.
108493: "Wozzamadda", the thug mumbles, "Loozzuming? Hee hee!"
108541: ihm
"Iwannayafomezelf...", your companion continues, waving his knife
about.
108663: Now that his little speech is over, the thug steps toward you and you
notice that his grip on the knife is tightening.
108741: The thug begins slashing the knife at you. He seems to be trying to
drive you back into the theatre.
108803: ehm
"Goinzid", the thug growls at you, "oraslashya!"
108851: The thug slashes his knife at your face, barely missing you. "Nekstime
yawonbe saluckee", he threatens.
108927: The thug promptly impales you in the throat with his knife. Death is
mercifully quick.
108995: You can retreat into the theatre.
109025: But that is what the thug wants you to do.
109066: The street thug cannot be passed. To escape you must solve the
Theatre's secrets first.
109143: The whole place emits the aroma of rotting flesh.
109183: Don't bother. They are solidly boarded up.
109214: Obviously the source of the smell, you can see a human skeleton lying
in a ragged heap in the corner.
109394: No way. Let the dead lie.
109420: I don't think you can put anything in the skeleton without it falling
to pieces.
109481: No way. The rags would just fall to pieces.
109527: Perhaps you should take a closer look at the dial.
109565: The pocket watch is connected to the skeleton by a chain. You could
remove it if you really wanted to, but you don't feel comfortable disturbing
the body.
109670: Actually, it looks like a pretty flashy pocket watch for its age, and
it has a little dial on it. It currently says it is about
109794: It is one of the dials that you can turn, and also push and pull it.
109842: It has been pushed all the way in.
109928: You have already pulled out the little dial as far as it will go.
109968: You pull the little dial out of the watch, a little bit.
110013: The dial is pushed in as far as it will go.
110043: You push the dial in a bit.
110072: The watch clicks a bit as you turn the dial.
110111: The hour hand turns around, (you notice that the minute hand is
jammed). The watch now says it is
110189: The dial is firmly attached to the watch.
110234: Here, the boxes have recently collapsed, creating a large pile of junk.
The air is very musty here.
110304: A large pile of carpet rolls have fallen over, effectively blocking the
way north, but you can go back to the south.
110378: The hallway continues north past some carpet rolls and south.
110432: A pile of carpet rolls block your way north.
110471: The carpet rolls have been pushed aside to allow passage to the north.
110517: The rolls, although precariously balanced, manage to block the way
north.
110576: You pushed the rolls as far as they can go.
110614: You give the pile of rolls a solid push, and they collapse freeing the
passage to the north. You suddenly realise that there was a body under the
pile!

You look closer at the body. Bloody Hell! It's Rienhart, one of the
Mulluer executives you were showing around earlier. The body has obviously been
crushed by the rolls.
110814: Rienhart's crushed corpse lies on the ground.
110937: . He possesses
110972: Every budding cannibal knows it's best to cook 'em up first.
111057: Rienhart's corporate greed days are over.
111096: You drag poor Rienhart over your shoulder.
111137: You gently ease poor Rienhart into the coffin. He, somehow, looks more
comfortable in there.
111219: You quickly browse through the appointment book. It seems to contain
the normal entries, appointments and "to do" lists. Today's entry mentions the
appointment you had earlier. You notice that in big red letters circled next to
the appointment is...

   "Collect Phone"
111395: If only you could find that cellular phone.
111428: Rienhart left his cellular phone here! If you can find that, then you
can call for help!
111498: The door has been nailed shut and nothing is going to open it.
111545: The doors seem to be locked from the inside.
111630: ehn. There is nothing in the rubbish bin that appears to be useful.
111671: . Amongst its rubbish is
111717: It is far too heavy to lift.
111837: ehn. There is nothing in the rubbish bin that appears to be useful.
111878: . Amongst the rubbish is
111938: A voice hisses out "You are too late! The show has already started over
half an hour ago.".
112004: A voice hisses out "You are too late! The show has finished.".
112052: A voice hisses out "You are far too early. Come back later."
112100: There is a sudden gust of cold air and you find yourself...
112156: Your old ticket flutters down beside you.
112207: A whisper echoes around you. "Enjoy the show!"
112256: c."I like it here",
112291: c."Hi there, sexy",
112323: She ignores your request.
112345: You take her in your arms and give her a kiss.
112379: "Oh, I'm so wet", she moans softly. "Take me..."
112423: She is getting aroused.
112449: You slowly slide your hand over her graceful curves.
112487: "Oh, I'm so wet", she moans softly. "Take me..."
112531: She is getting aroused.
112605: After your initial foreplay she is hot and ready to go. You settle in
for some hard love making. Your passion is infectious and soon the others join
in. Hours of pleasure later, you all relax, your lusts sated for the moment.
112835: The large portrait blocks the way north.
112867: The portrait is huge! You would never be able to carry it.
112907: The portrait is firmly attached to the wall.
112939: It seems very realistic in places.
112969: It has an irregular feel with lots of ridges, particularly around the
area where the painted door is.
113041: The surface of the painting is bumpy.
113073: The surface of the painting is bumpy.
113105: The surface of the painting is bumpy.
113137: It feels very real. It feels as if you could just open it.
113207: Surprisingly, the painted door opens easily, revealing a passage
leading north.
113283: You can hear something out there. It seems to be very close and comes
from all around you.
113336: You can't see the ghostly presence to do anything to it, but somehow
you can feel that it is near.
113475: You get no response.
113490: You can't see the ghostly presence to do anything to it, but somehow
you can feel that it is near.
113566: You hear a faint whisper from out of the darkness, "Ticketsss,
pleassse".
113622: You hear a shallow breathing from nearby.
113654: You hear a faint whisper from out of the darkness, "Ticketsss,
pleassse".
113710: You hear a shallow breathing from nearby.
113742: You hear a harsher voice echoing out of the darkness, "Ticketsss, now!"
113796: Suddenly, from the darkness, a cold grasp reaches out...
113847: Perhaps you should give him what he wants.
113883: You don't have it? Perhaps you should just run away.
113925: And come back later when you do have it.
113953: The voice maybe a ghost. Who would it be a ghost of?
113999: Hmm, I wonder how the ghost can tell the time.
114041: You need a definite plan of action to work things out.
114140: That is too far away. Try going down the stairs.
114211: For a moment you think you hear footsteps echoing up from the lobby
below, but when you look down you see nothing.
114286: Below you is the theatre lobby.
114310: Actually you see that the light shining through the window has made a
spotlight on the lobby floor below.
114388: Now that you have opened the curtains you can see the window behind
them.
114427: Behind the curtains is a patterned circular window, which I suppose you
can get at more easily if you just opened them.
114538: You open the curtains revealing a curiously patterned circular window,
illuminated by the street lights behind it.
114639: There is no apparent way to open it.
114667: No way! That patterned window is meant to be unique and irreplaceable
feature of the theatre front. Besides, you would hurt yourself on all the
broken glass.
114770: You might as well try to reach out and grab the moon.
114813: The spotlight is on you now, but your new found fame changes little.
114901: You put the clear lens into the direct centre of the spotlight. Somehow
the pattern seems to get burned into the lens!
115010: The patterns make no sense to you at the moment.
115050: Try looking down.
115160: You can hear that something else is in the room with you.
115219: A sudden burst of cold air stops you in your tracks.
115271: This is not the time or place for a rest.
115392: You can hear that something else is in the room with you.
115451: A sudden burst of cold air stops you in your tracks.
115503: This is not the time or place for a rest.
115579: There is nothing special about that at all.
115695: As you take the photo there is a burst of bright light as the flash
goes off. The shadow creature gives a loud scream and vanishes!
115797: A shadow forms out of the gloom and stops you, driving you back with a
wave of cold air.
115859: The shadow blocks your way.
115882: Amongst the gloom you can see a shadowy outline moving about.
115941: There is a burst of light as the star crystal hits the shadow creature,
and you can see the light destroying it. Unfortunately, the ensuing explosion
slays you too.
116053: You get no response.
116103: You feel a cold presence touch you.
116134: Shadows are formed from darkness.
116166: And the opposite of darkness is...
116329: Looking through the stuff you see little of interest; some coins, a
pencil, and little bits of paper.
116435: You cannot make out anything distinguishable.
116514: The voices came from above you.
116547: You hear voices from above you, but you can not make out what is being
said.
116601: You hear a mumbled conversation above you.
116662: You are in the eastern balcony overlooking the theatre auditorium,
where once the elite would have been seated enjoying the shows on the stage
below. Far across from you to the west you can see the other balcony seats. The
only exit for those who cannot fly is down to the south.
116907: This is not the time or place for a rest.
116934: Yes!
116950: But you need to have a girlfriend called Jane.
117022: It is too far away.
117045: It is too high up.
117166: You grab hold of the Chandelier and swing across. Below you the seats
become an endless blur. You see the western wall and balcony approaching
rapidly. You close your eyes and let go. After a painful landing you find
yourself...
117323: You grab hold of the Chandelier and swing across. Below you the seats
become an endless blur. You see the eastern wall and balcony approaching
rapidly. You close your eyes and let go. After a painful landing you find
yourself...
117477: You grab hold of the chandelier but nothing much happens. Perhaps if
you tried pushing it.
117544: As you grab the chandelier its gentle swaying stops altogether.
117591: As the chandelier swings by you grab hold of it. However you jumping
onto it seems to have robbed it of most of its momentum. Perhaps if you were
higher up.
117691: You polish it a little, but your effort is wasted. It is just too
dirty.
117757: Ahn
The chandelier comes to a stop.
117800: The chandelier swings a little more gently now.
117847: Below you, the auditorium's chandelier has been lowered to the ground
level.
117897: The chandelier has been lowered to ground level for easy access.
118018: The chandelier is gently swinging back and forth.
118127: . According to a dial you have
118190: If you want to take a picture of something type in PHOTOGRAPH OBJECT.
To advance the film just WIND THE CAMERA.
118284: If you opened the camera, it would ruin the film.
118349: You have run out of film!
118367: You wind the camera, advancing the film on.
118424: It seems unused.
118447: You catch a glimpse of something moving in the corner of your eye.
However, when you whirl around there is nothing there.
118527: Don't bother. The stage doors have been securely sealed forever.
118575: A quick pull of ropes determines they are sturdy enough to climb.
118621: You clamber up the rope...
118655: You could play Tarzan for a while, but the only exits still remain west
or down.
118726: Due to your precarious position here, you don't want to muck about. You
have two options, going back down to the stage, or going west.
118810: You clamber back down to safety...
118843: The locker moves a little as you push it.
118927: As the locker goes over the doorway, it tips and then falls down to the
stage below with a loud crunch.
118996: Pushing it would be easier.
119030: As you reach into the locker, the snake strikes, biting you in the
hand. The stinging sensation soon stops as you expire.
119109: It's a bit too heavy to lift up.
119152: As you open the locker you hear a nasty hiss. Inside is
119217: The snake hisses at you as you close it once more inside the locker.
119262: You give the locker a sturdy push.
119303: It is too big and in too many pieces.
119344: I don't think the snake will let you do that.
119392: As you reach for the snake, it strikes at you biting your hand. You
stumble backwards and collapse to the ground as you find it increasingly more
difficult to breath...
119525: The snake ignores you.
119542: Well, going near the snake will probably get you bitten by it, so
perhaps you should deal with the problem from another angle.
119626: Or perhaps another place. Now you just have to get the snake there.
119694: This is a miserably dank underground passage lined by old brick walls.
The passage heads up to the west and continues to the east to
119845: Despite their appearance, the brick walls are firmly mortared.
119890: The iron door looks quite sturdy. It is currently
119926: Hnlocked tightly shut.
120018: It is pretty simple. You just need to find the key for it.
120066: And then you can just UNLOCK and OPEN it.
120102: In the centre of this huge cavern-like room is a large pit, somewhat
reminding you of an empty indoor swimming pool. A passage heads off to the west
to
120323: You hear a loud snoring coming from down the pit.
120389: You can hear some sort of growling beast in the pit.
120425: A savage roar issues forth from the pit.
120452: You can hear something large moving below in the pit.
120491: You haven't got enough of anything to fill the pit with.
120531: For a closer look, you will have to go down into it.
120627: You hear a curious sniffing sound from down in the pit.
120670: You hear a deafening roar of pain from the pit and then there is a
tremendous explosion. Several tons of burning theatre collapses on top of you.
(On the bright side, you did kill the monster).
120796: adnlj. You can hear some awful crushing sounds, like bone grinding on
bones, coming down from the pit
120939: Hzbzse to         ger,
Above you can hear a loud clang as the iron door
slams shut!
121022: It seems that the snoring was a cruel ruse by the beast to lure you
into the pit. Sadly, feeding it Rienhart's body only gave it a taste for human
flesh.
121113: With a howl the creature charges you. You are unable to see or resist
its onslaught.
121174: Its been in the pit for a long time. Perhaps its hungry.
121224: You could feed it yourself, or perhaps you could give it something else
to eat.
121278: The traditional monster food is meat.
121312: The creature, however, can eat a lot, so you will have to make the meal
last a while.
121399: There seems to be no immediate way to open it.
121465: You are as close to the sewage as you want to get!
121559: You push the lever with all your might but nothing happens. Perhaps if
you pulled it?
121619: The lever slowly gives as you pull it. You hear a grinding sound from
the west, and realise that the sluice gate is opening. There are loud sloshing
noises as hundreds of litres of sewage pour through the gate, into the trench
121800: The lever slowly slides back into position as the gate automatically
closes.
121965: The rats hiss viciously at you as you attempt to go that way.
122022: As you attempt to walk through the archway, it suddenly lights up and
you get thrown roughly backwards, as if by magic.
122100: As you attempt to walk through the archway, it suddenly lights up and
you get pushed gently backwards. You notice that the amulet gently glows.
122187: The amulet gently glows as you walk through the archway.
122306: No, I don't think so.
122383: Gross!
122404: The rats ignore you.
122434: The rats seem interested in the popcorn.
122498: The rats are too far away.
122520: There are too many of them.
122548: Angry little rats swarm all around you.
122582: To the east you can see a swarm of nasty little rats.
122622: To the west you can see a swarm of nasty little rats.
122667: To the east you can see a swarm of nasty little rats.
122707: To the west you can see a swarm of nasty little rats.
123063: One of the rats jumps up at your face, biting at you. While you defend
yourself a couple of others, taking a running jump, knock you over. As you can
pick yourself up, you can see one of the rats disappearing into the distance
with the jewelled dagger!
123226: One of the rats grabs the jewelled dagger and runs away with it.
123288: With squeals of delight the rats consume the popcorn.
123331: In the distance you can see the rats are eating something.
123496: At 9kca  Ehn
The rats jump up at you excitedly, theirs noses twitching.
123554: The rats swarm about your feet occasionally biting you.
123596: The rats screech at you.
123643: The rats scurry about, chewing at the nearby dung.
123759: A large swarm of rats scurries out of the southeastern tunnel, their
noses twitching excitedly.
123886: A swarm of rats slithers in from the northwest.
123922: The rats disappear down the southeastern tunnel.
123961: The rats disappear from the eastern end of the sewer.
124053: The rats move closer and now swarm all around you.
124091: The rats scurry towards you, down the drainage trench.
124185: The rats move closer and now swarm all around you.
124267: The rats move further away from you, to the eastern end of the drainage
trench.
124321: The rats move away to the eastern end of the sewer.
124369: The rats move further away from you, to the western end of the drainage
trench.
124467: The rats move closer and now swarm all around you.
124505: The rats move away to the western end of the sewer.
124548: The rats scurry towards you, down the drainage trench.
124588: The rats move closer and now swarm all around you.
124714: You will need to get rid of them somehow.
124750: Stay by the rats for a while. They should do random things.
124798: If they don't, and do one particular thing all the time, then that is a
clue.
124856: They will react to something you are carrying. Give it to them.
124904: Hmm, perhaps if you try elsewhere.
124930: Read the description more carefully.
124969: Perhaps you need some protection. Try looking closer backstage.
125013: You need an object you haven't come across yet. Try tackling another
problem.
125089: Despite the fact it seems to be very, very heavy, it is also far to hot
to touch.
125151: It is hot to the touch.
125171: Actually, a rather pleasant odour comes from the cauldron.
125260: The popcorn is dissolved into the bubbling liquid.
125402: . The statue is holding a jewelled dagger.
125434: The statue depicts a woman that is both hauntingly beautiful and
frightfully savage. Her near-perfect beauty is blemished by an elongated
forehead, which has four eye sockets forming the shape of a diamond.
126227: You have a feeling that something really bad might happen if you just
put the pearl into the socket without knowing into which one it should go
into.

Do you really want to do that?
126339: Better safe than sorry.
126405: As you place the eye into the socket the statue recoils backwards as if
the pearl was burning hot. It takes a moment to recover and then it stabs you
with the dagger.
126565: As you place the eye into the socket the statue recoils backwards as if
the pearl was burning hot. It takes a moment to recover and then it stabs you
with the dagger.
126910: . The jewelled dagger falls to the floor.
126942: It is one of those curved ceremonial types, with strange hieroglyphics
inscribed on the blade. It appears to be made of silver, and encrusted with
gems, while a
127153: You will need to free the dagger from the statue first.
127200: You will need to free the dagger from the statue first.
127240: That doesn't fit in the hilt's depression.
127320: The dagger is firmly attached to the statue.
127357: It would just seep through your fingers, and you don't have a container
that could stand the heat.
127415: The liquid smells quite pleasant.
127469: You take a tentative sip of the liquid. Although it is rather hot it
has a very pleasant taste. Relaxing, you gulp down another couple of mouthfuls,
not realising how hungry you really were. Its only on your third mouthful that
you see the
127633: float to the surface of the liquid. You gag uncontrollably and then
vomit into the corner of the room.
127705: You were carrying it around with you before and it wasn't that
important, so why would you want it now.
127784: Looking closer at your vomit you notice something unusual in it.
Grimacing, you reach in and take out a small metal object. Wiping it clean, you
can see that is a ring. You will certainly remember to chew your food properly,
the next time you go gulping down unknown casseroles.
127957: You don't remember eating half of that.
127989: Lets not get carried away. Remember the rules of social etiquette frown
on playing with vomit.
128057: That is so gross that the author doesn't want to even think about it.
128286: The pearl is perfectly round, and almost two centimetres in diameter.
Embedded in it is a small
128882: You will need to get the statue to let go of the dagger.
128926: The dagger is being gripped by four hands. What else has the statue got
four of?
128986: We are not talking fingers or toes here.
129024: The statue has four eye sockets. Perhaps there is a connection.
129074: Four eyes have been scattered about the theatre here. You need to find
them and return them to their rightful sockets.
129150: Having problems knowing which eye belongs where?
129194: Perhaps you could ask for some help.
129223: You can't make out the chanting that well, as it seems to be in a
unfamiliar language.
129286: The chanting sounds awfully sinister in that direction.

Are you sure
you want to go that way?
129352: Perhaps it is for the best.
129370: Not if you have something better to do first.
129398: "Perfect timing", she cackles, moving closer to you.
129435: Rough hands grab you from behind, and a smell of rotting flesh assails
you. You struggle but cannot break free of the vice-like grip. You can clearly
see the features of the woman now, as she faces you. Her eyes are solid black
while her pale skin seems to be tightly stretched over her narrow
undernourished face, giving an almost skeletal appearance. It is almost
impossible to tell her age but you get the impression of great antiquity.
129704: She smiles coldly at you. "Your marrow smells so sweet, but I must
restrain myself. Your death serves a higher purpose."
129798: She reaches out and rummages through your pockets eventually pulling
out the jewelled dagger.
129868: You hear a nearby squeaking as a rat rushes in dragging behind it the
jewelled dagger, which she takes.
129942: She pulls out the jewelled dagger. It looks none the worse for being
flushed down the drain.
130005: She pulls out a jewelled dagger, with a strange brown crystal in the
hilt of it.
130059: She pulls out the jewelled dagger.
130102: She retrieves the brown crystal from you and puts it back into the
dagger's hilt.
130162: Taking out the brown crystal, she puts it back into the dagger's
hilt.

"It was very difficult finding that little bauble down the drain."
130248: She takes out the brown crystal and puts it back into the dagger's
hilt.
130296: She brings back the dagger, then slashes down at your face. You feel
the blade slice through the flesh of your face leaving a hot searing wound. You
can feel your blood running down your face and neck.
130415: The room darkens as the light sphere turns bright red.
130450: "Your blood summons the old one. A path is formed and a new gate will
open. It will be drawn to this planet now by the taste of your soul."
130550: The temperature in the room suddenly lowers drastically as the lighted
sphere turns black, flooding the room with darkness. You can feel an immensely
powerful presence entering the area.

You start screaming...
130677: Suddenly her voice falters as she stares at the dagger.
130730: crystal", she shouts. She turns and runs towards the light. "Forgive
me, Great One. I did not know. I was tricked!"
130815: The light sphere suddenly turns bright blue and shrinks quickly to the
size of a ping pong ball. A wind seems to blow towards the small sphere of
light.
130910: "No! Please," the woman whimpers. "I don't want to go back. I want to
live forever."
130973: The wind blows stronger and the woman seems to fall into the light and
vanish. You are released by your captor, but before you can do anything, this
wind seems to pick you up and throw you into the light.
131143: You are in something that looks very much like a mine shaft. In the dim
electrical light you can just make out rough walls and not much else. Tunnels
lead in all directions.
131259: Not without some pretty heavy mining equipment.
131300: A large cage dominates the area.
131359: . It appeared to be resting but as you entered it awoke and sniggered
at you with a surprisingly soft voice
131438: The creature sees what you are doing and shrieks at you.

"Don't let me
out! You will only get me into trouble."
131515: It is hard too tell who finds whom more repulsive!
131579: The bars of the cage would make that difficult.
131626: "Oh, pretty. Much nicer than the one I dug up."
131666: The creature looks at the crystal sadly. "Clawed in the dirt for months
for that, I did. It changed me. Made me like this, but she needed it. She said
that she needed it blooded to draw her master to this point. No other crystal
could do it."
131818: The creature whimpers sadly.
131842: "No doubt belongs to some predecessor of yours."
131880: "Frightfully amateurish work. Look at that. They moved a couple of
supporting studs! Obviously not correctly trained. Still to be fair, it will
work quite well."
132002: The creature eats the popcorn.
132033: The creature look closer at the gem.

"Oh, that is one of the Eyes of
Power, which guards the lady's most prized treasure. That one is the
132128: Eye of Mana. It forms the foundation of all the other eyes."
132168: Eye of Strength. It is the right hand of all the other eyes."
132212: Eye of Control. It stands above the other eyes."
132248: Eye of Wisdom. It stands beside Strength to help balance the other
eyes."
132316: "Infocom were the Gods of the Implementer and Engineer."
132364: "You are fat and ugly."
132392: "The Implementer used to tools of the Engineer to create the universe."
132448: "The Engineer created the tools that enabled the Implementer to create
the entire world."
132510: "Some sort of cabbage isn't it?"
132542: "The Eyes of Power are used to control the guardian."
132584: The creature shudders.

"Utter ruthless creature. The lady forced me to
help her create the beast."
132654: A tear rolls down the creature's cheek.
132690: "I once had a name, but I cannot remember it now."
132747: The creature recoils at the name. "Quiet!" it hisses at you, "She might
be listening."
132811: "They have great power, because they are formed when too much mystical
energy is at one place at a time."
132885: "He got away, with his beloved. It was the only good that came out of
my actions."
132945: "There are so many monsters now."
132977: "They hold the key to great secrets. Show some to me, and I will tell
you more."
133035: "Special stones were lucky to people who were born on a certain month.
If you show me a gem I can tell you if it is a birthstone or not."
133126: "I don't know anything about that."
133163: "Flee, quickly! You must leave this place. If she sees you here, you
will be lucky if she just kills you."
133234: "I obey only her now.", the creature whimpers.
133279: "I was once like you." the creature says with a surprisingly soft
voice.
133333: "I thought I could beat her too", the creature says, "I tried to help a
colleague and this is my reward."
133409: The creature paces back and forth in the cage.
133443: "Dig, dig, dig", say the creature. "That's all I ever seemed to do. Did
learn lots about rocks and stones though. They talked to me, while I slept."
133546: The creature seems to get upset if you try to free him.
133592: Perhaps you shouldn't bother.
133622: He does rattle on a bit. Perhaps it knows something useful.
133672: You can always ask him or show him things.
133824: sxmsecret library. The room is filled with
133953: The air is filled with the smell of musty paper. Aisles lead south,
while a small recess lies to the north. To the east, a bookcase has collapsed
leaving a hole in the wall.
134069: It is just the hook the chain used to be attached to.
134100: A metal chain is attached to the hook.
134180: You can only push the shelves to the south.
134224: You have already pushed them all over.
134254: The silky ropes seems to hold them sturdily in place.
134296: The metal chain stops the shelves from toppling over.
134336: You will need a good reason to destroy all those bookcases!
134412: With a good push the first bookcase tips over, striking the next one.
That collapses, knocking the next one. Like a series of dominos, all the
bookcases fall over one by one. As the last one topples, far to the south, you
can hear a sickening crunch.
134701: None of them seem that useful.
134725: Your grab a book from random, and read a little, but soon return it to
the bookcase, as it is unhelpful.
134790: The chain is quite long, old, and rusty. It connects all the library
shelves together.
134850: The chain stretches off to the north.
134880: The chain has been unhooked from the north wall.
134909: The chain has been hooked to the north wall.
134947: The chain has been fixed to the shelves permanently.
134997: You can only connect the chain to the hook.
135031: The connection must be to the north.
135061: The chain no longer reaches the hook.
135089: The chain is already hooked onto the hook.
135119: You hook the chain back onto the hook.
135161: You can only disconnect the chain from the hook.
135195: The connection must be to the north.
135223: The chain is already unhooked from the hook.
135253: You unhook the chain from the hook.
135409: A cold and damp breeze blows in from a broken French window to the
west, while a library aisle leads north.
135498: The giant slug blocks the way to the window.
135545: The slug monster zealously guards the nest, but you can see an eye-like
pearl in it.
135603: The slug monster zealously guards the nest.
135640: In the centre of the nest you can see a large slug or larva at least
one and a half metres in length.
135739: The slug ignores you.
135770: The slug spits at you a second time. This time the spittle hits you on
the face. It is a gruesome way to die.
135838: As you approach the slug, it spits at you. The spittle hits your
shoulder and it burns through your clothing like acid. Screaming in pain you
grab a book and scrape off the acid. You wouldn't want to do that again.
136068: The crystal flies through the air striking the slug. In a burst of
white light the slug literally melts. Unfortunately the following fireball
destroys everything else.
136179: hits the slug but the force of the throw is absorbed by its soft flesh.
The ripple effect produced is quite nauseating to watch.
136285: As you touch the strands your hand sticks to them. It is only after
much struggling that you manage to free yourself.
136355: As you touch the strands you find your hand stuck to them. You try to
pull away, but your wriggling only attracts the attention of the giant slug,
which slithers towards you. Slowly it embeds its needle-pointed end into your
shoulder. The pain you endure as it injects acid into you is too intense to
describe. Horribly you are still alive when it begins to suck out your
dissolving flesh...
136595: It is all crushed now. You would probably need a couple buckets to
scoop it up with.
136653: Gross!
136667: Why bother? It is quite dead.
136690: Deal with the slug the same way people deal with all annoying insects.
136744: Before they had fly-spray and other insecticides.
136786: You need a giant fly swat. Look around. What is big and flat?
136856: You can hear a strange piano melody coming from above you. The melody
is a classical piece sounding a little like Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata"
136959: The strange piano melody continues.
136998: A strange piano melody can be heard very faintly from above.
137050: As you descend the stairs the melody fades away.
137090: As you climb the stairs the melody abruptly stops.
137699: You must pour the liquid onto something to empty the vial.
137739: I don't think that will fit in the vial.
137781: You need to keep the clear blue liquid in the small vial otherwise it
would just spill everywhere.
137878: Glumly, you drink the liquid. Almost instantly you feel very tired and
137963: , falling into a dead slumber. Later on you awake to the sound of
chanting. Looking up you see an unfamiliar ceiling above you and a bright light
shines down upon you.
138071: Against the light you suddenly see a silhouette of a long curved dagger
and then your screams begin...
138143: They are pills so you eat not drink them.
138175: You are not in that much pain, yet.
138221: You cannot put that on over the gas mask.
138268: The stethoscope is becoming uncomfortable to wear. Perhaps you should
remove it.
138330: You remove the stethoscope, as it is irritating your ears too much.
138430: You cannot reach the trapdoor from your current position.
138517: Ignore the junk.
138577: An open trapdoor in the ceiling leads up.
138607: An open trapdoor in the floor leads down.
138645: There is a closed trapdoor in the ceiling.
138673: There is a closed trapdoor in the floor.
138730: You cannot reach the trapdoor from your current position.
138766: Perhaps you need to grow a little taller.
138804: Or elevate your position in life.
138838: A little song can lift your spirits.
138925: That would be a good way to get yourself killed.
138964: Supported on the floor by a couple of sturdy crossbeams is a large
winch with a handle. From the winch a thick cable runs down through a hole in
the floor.
139105: Besides the fact that you can't fit through the hole in floor, you
could never get a good enough grip on the cable to stop you plummeting to your
death on the cruel seats below.
139238: As you turn the handle, the winch raises the chandelier to just below
the floor.
139302: As you turn the handle, the winch lowers the chandelier to the
auditorium floor far below.
139367: The cable extends down to the theatre floor.
139395: Through the cracks you can see that the cable ends at a large
chandelier.
139447: The chandelier is too far away.
139478: You cannot reach it as it is beneath the floor. Besides it looks very
heavy.
139558: If you examine it closely you will see that it has a handle, which
raises and lowers a chandelier.
139628: But you need to be elsewhere, to get any benefit.
139707: You get the creepy sensation that you are being watched.
139817: Out of the corner of your eye, you glimpse movement from the gladiator
mannequin.
139879: Ever so slowly, you notice the pirate mannequin turn its head to look
at you with its unseeing eyes.
140063: The mannequins move closer, but as they cross the puddle of glue they
stop, unable to move their feet.
140149: The mannequins hiss at you as they struggle against the glue.
140191: Unable to move their feet, the mannequins squirm about where they
stand.
140238: The mannequins reach out at you, clawing the air.
140307: The mannequins group around you blocking your escape. The gladiator
impales you with its trident.
140379: Err, um... I don't think
140469: Violence is not the answer. Particularly since all the mannequins are
armed.
140537: As you reach out to take it from the mannequin, it draws away from you
and issues a loud hiss.
140617: There are three nasty looking mannequins between you and the gas mask.
140674: As you reach out to take the gas mask, the mannequins issue a loud
hiss.
140738: You can't put that on over the stethoscope.
140795: You slip past the mannequins and take the now unprotected gas mask.
140891: Breathing in that gas mask is becoming difficult. Perhaps you should
take it off so you can breath more easily.
140980: You remove the mask so that you can breath more easily.
141018: Run away...
141074: Avoidance is a good way to solve a sticky situation.
141117: You don't want it.
141150: You struggle through the Soldier's Waltz. It's been a while since you
last practiced.
141214: The mannequins seem unimpressed by your efforts, but it was a valiant
attempt, anyway.
141271: You do a sterling rendition of Chopsticks, it being the only piano
piece you know by heart.
141337: You cannot do that to the piano when standing on it.
141368: The piano moves quite freely.
141406: The piano would never make it down the stairs.
141441: You cannot do that to the piano when standing on it.
141488: The piano rolls to a stop.
141513: Pushing it would be easier.
141614: You can only put sheet music on the piano.
141663: The piano moves easily as you push it.
141742: It seems to be arranged for a piano. Looking at it brings back
childhood memories of long tortuous piano practice sessions. Anyway, to play it
just put it on the piano and then play the piano.
141881: You can't go that way.
141913: You can't go that way.
141992: Carefully, you clamber down the sooty shaft.
142036: Carefully, you clamber up the sooty shaft.
142080: Actually, you can climb up or down the chimney.
142197: You clamber down the shaft.
142226: You clamber back up the shaft.
142257: Actually, you can climb up or down the chimney.
142309: You are relieved to find that the coffin is empty. No, actually,
looking closer you can see that there is a key in there caught up in the
lining.
142403: You are not ready for the grave yet.
142435: The door is soundly sealed. You will never get it open.
142487: You give the velvet lining a strong yank but it doesn't give.
142542: The key is caught in the lining and you cannot reach it.
142586: Can't reach the key? Perhaps you need a smaller hand.
142632: Or someone else's smaller hands.
142685: You clamber back up the shaft.
142839: Wonder Glue
      Bonds in seconds!
    Safe to use (will not 
   stick
to living things)!
142931: Sadly, the jar seems to be sealed tight. Looks like the glue works
quite well.
142995: The jar of glue shatters as you break it, splashing glue everywhere.
143049: The jar of glue soars through the air and shatters as it hits the
ground, splashing glue everywhere.
143110: The ground is covered with a sticky substance.
143150: It is indeed fortunate that the glue doesn't stick to living tissue,
otherwise you would be in a sticky situation (if you can pardon the pun).
143239: You have no suitable source of fire.
143342: You are high on the roof of the theatre, near a large chimney. All
around you, the city is starting to light up for the oncoming sunset.
143428: The roof slopes off dangerously in all directions but you know that you
can safely go west to the balcony. Also a chimney leads down
143571: Youyepn.
143633: You clamber down the chimney.
143728: The crow looks inside the coffin and flies down into it. It then flies
out with something shiny in its beak. As the crow flies up the chimney with its
new prize, it drops it. The crow promptly caws in annoyance, and then continues
up the chimney.
143899: The crow quickly eats some of the popcorn.
143942: The crow caws mournfully.
143966: The crow preens itself, unruffling some feathers.
144002: The crow shifts side to side.
144227: The crow seems to want the popcorn but doesn't seem to trust you enough
to take it from your hand.
144284: The crow ignores you generous offer.
144369: The crow caws curiously at you.
144394: Look closer at the poor little thing.
144430: It looks hungry and miserable.
144502: dyb GhnThe gas is making you dizzy. You lose your concentration before
you can do that.
144582: A strange greenish gas pours out of the telescope.
144633: The gas mask protects you from the gas.
144661: The gas makes you feel a little dizzy.
144694: The gas overwhelms you!
144730: It is oddly shaped because there is no little eye piece to look into.
It is roughly a cylinder 1 metre long, with
144808: hxnlenses at both ends. Looking closer you notice that one of the
lenses is removable.
144863: a coloured lens at one end. The telescope is filled with a strange
greenish gas, that is leaking out.
144936: Completing the scene is a large strangely shaped telescope.
144995: A green gas is pouring out of it.
145043: You never want to look through that blasted thing again.
145103: As you gaze through the telescope, the patterned lens seems to cancel
out the patterned window, as well as the greenish gas giving you a clear view
of the night sky.

You suddenly realise that the sun hasn't set yet but you can
clearly make out all the various stars. Wait a second... the stars are moving!
They are moving aside, to let something else come up from beyond them. An
intensely alien presence awaits, tearing at the very fabric of the physical
universe, waiting for something to happen to let it in. A cold chill runs down
your spine as you realise that the presence has turned its attention to you.
You can feel its scrutiny as its eyes focus on you.

With a muffled cry, you
recoil back from the telescope, collapsing on the floor. Monstrous thoughts
bombard your mind as you flail on the floor. An overwhelming feeling of
anticipation overcomes you. A sense of impending freedom, a longing for
vengeance, a hunger for your very soul. You scream out loud, in an attempt to
block the flood of emotions, but you cannot. To escape the steady flow of
nightmares, your mind mercifully collapse into unconsciousness.

You awake
later and struggle to your feet. You notice you are carrying something new
amongst your possessions.
145836: You see an indistinct green blur, as you look into the telescope. It
makes the patterned window even stranger.
145908: If you want to take the lens, just take the lens.
145958: Returning the lens stops the flow of the gas.
145995: You breath in a lungful of the stuff and instantly regret it.
146044: You can't do anything to the green gas.
146069: It is a sluggish moving gas, slightly green in colour, pouring out of
the telescope. There seems to be enough of it.
146198: . It is almost as if it is reacting to the light.
146251: through the lens doesn't alter it in any way. It looks like the lens
doesn't magnify anything at all.)
146341: Strange, when you look into the lens it doesn't distort what you see.
It is as if it is just clear old glass.
146425: With a loud hiss you remove the lens from the telescope. You can't help
but notice that a green foul smelling gas emits from the new opening.
146517: Telescope are used to look at things far away. To use the telescope
just LOOK INTO THE TELESCOPE.
146605: While you are there, why don't you LOOK AT IT as well.
146647: The gas is fatal, so don't dawdle with the lens.
146687: Protection is in ignorance.
146717: Isn't there a similar place to the attic, that you can uncover?
146774: On the floor in the centre of the spotlight is the newly formed
patterned lens.
146858: The pattern on the lens and the pattern on spotlight are exactly the
same.
146906: The pattern on the lens and the pattern on window are exactly the same.
146954: The pattern on the window and the pattern on the lens mix together in
an unpleasant way. It is fortunate that you cannot hold the lens steadily.
147086: The pattern distorts everything you see.
147274: The man is dressed in clothes that were in style at least 70 years ago.
147326: The man seems to be grasping his stomach in pain.
147359: Looking at the bloody wound, it would seem this gentleman has been
shot.
147514: The man scoffs all of the pills. You can see him visibly relax as the
pills remove his pain.

"Thanks", he says, "my name is Trent. I know you don't
know me but I must ask of you a favour, one that may seem a request of madness,
but you
147672: do it."

"Below, is an evil in female form. You must destroy her, if
you do not she will do great harm."
147764: "Please, kill the bitch."
147788: ehn
"Please, you must believe me. She must be destroyed."
147846: It will take more than courtesy to get you out of this one.
147892: The younger lady raises her pistol and, quite literally, blows your
brains out.
147954: The dagger hits her in the shoulder and she staggers back as her pistol
goes off, firing low but not low enough. You scream in agony as you feel your
left knee explode and you collapse in a heap on the floor. The old hag picks up
the pistol and wanders over to you. She points the gun directly at your
face.

"I will tell her everything. Forewarned is forearmed. I won't make the
same mistake again."

With that she fires.
148221: The crystal flies through the air, and hits the young
woman.

"Excellent", cries the old hag, "Now we don't have to bother to dig one
up."

The young woman seems less pleased about it, however, and shoots you.
148364: She dodges the attack and raises her pistol and shoots you.
148418: It will take more than courtesy to get you out of this one.
148459: No thanks.
148476: As you move in, the younger lady raises her pistol and, quite
literally, blows your brains out.
148548: The dagger hits the old woman in the shoulder and she staggers back
wounded. The young lady points her pistol at you and fires. The shot hits you
in the head killing you instantly.
148663: The old hag catches the crystal nimbly.

"Excellent", cries the old
hag, "Now we don't have to bother to dig one up."

The young woman shrugs and
then shoots you.
148778: She dodges the attack, and the younger woman callously raises her
pistol and shoots you.
148844: The old hag shrieks at the younger woman.

"Quickly, fool! He has given
us a second chance. He brought me here so that you will not repeat my
mistake."

She points at you.

"Our enemy has arrived. Now, kill!"
148988: "He will deprive you of the knowledges you have sought, if you don't
kill him now!"
149044: ihn
"Shoot him!"

The young lady's face hardens as a look of
determination appears.
149109: Much to the old hag's delight, the young lady points her pistol at you
and fires. You try to dodge but cannot and the bullet hits you in the chest,
crumpling you into a heap. The women stand over you, saying something but you
cannot concentrate on their words. Slowly consciousness drains away...
149294: The crystal flies through the air and hits her squarely on the
shoulder. There is a massive discharge of energy as the crystal shatters and
you, the women, and the entire house are consumed in an immense explosion.
149475: There is nothing but dust behind the posters.
149543: Just leave!
149561: Don't worry too much if the pager is missing. Just have a look around a
bit.
149608: You have reset time, so just get your pager and leave.
149659: You pull a couple of the hooks at random but nothing seems to happen.
149751: You go to pick up the papers but decide not to bother in the end, they
are just too boring.
149874: It was through here that you left your pager.
149957: Looking about you realise that your pager is not here. Damn!
150012: gaa,
As you enter, the northern door of the office opens, and Rienhart
walks in. When he notices you he jumps in fright. 

"Oh, you startled me," he
says, grinning sheepishly. "I hope you don't mind me coming back in here but I
left my cell phone behind. Anyway, while I was searching for it I found this as
well", and he passes you your pager.

"Well I have to go, I'm in a bit of a
rush", and with that he heads southeast into the lobby.
150366: You hear the sound of a car start up and drive away.
150463: No way! You came all this way just to get the blasted thing.
150564: You are not leaving until you have your pager.
150597: You get into your car, and start the engine. As you look out the
windows to check that the way is clear, a leather-dressed figure limps into
view. There is something sinister about the figure and the jerky way he walks,
so you slip the car into gear and drive off. You get the uncanny sensation that
the figure is staring at you, as you disappear into the distance.

attention to yourself by uttering those words.

159568: Story of the Lyric Theatre.
159624: The letter confirming my appointment as draftsman at Baggett, Kuhl, and
O'Leary, arrived this morning. I leave on Wednesday. I dread telling Melissa. I
will definitely miss her. She is rather sweet but I will not propose to her. I
am only 22 and I have a whole lot of living to do. There are no places to sow
wild oats here.
159874: My first day at the firm has been very eventful. I was shown around the
offices and introduced to everybody and then was given an office with another
chap called Brighton. I spent the rest of the day revising some old drafts that
the architects had done.

The firm is very busy, as they are preparing a tender
to build a new theatre for a client called Horton. I have never heard of this
person but he seems to have all the big wigs upstairs as busy as bees in a
hive. Apparently he is one of the new oil chaps. One day I hope to be as rich
as he.
160272: The firm has won the account to build the theatre. Brighton and I have
been assigned to the team involved. The main architect is Trent. Curiously,
Horton wants his daughter, Elizabeth, involved in some of the minor details,
much to Trent's distress.
160482: Alexander Horton and his daughter, Elizabeth. Miss Horton, to use
Brighton's terminology, is quite a dish. I tend to agree. She seems very
intelligent, and has the most splendid eyes. A true raven-haired beauty. Seeing
her has made me very glad I didn't propose to Melissa, who seems almost dull
compared to Elizabeth.
 
Still I have yet to gain my fortune, so ladies like
Miss Horton are still out of my reach. That doesn't seem to stop Brighton. He
clearly has a way with the ladies. I suppose I am a little envious.
160874: Today, Trent and I went to Horton's house to discuss some design
matters. Brighton was quite annoyed that I went instead of himself, but I
suspect that Trent was a little concerned about his behaviour towards Miss
Elizabeth.
 
We arrived at the Hortons' estate a little after 3. It was a
rather smashing place with large gardens, a tennis court, and a small private
zoo, where there was a tiger! I didn't get to see the beast itself, but I could
hear it roaring quite loudly when we arrived.

Horton and Trent spent a lot of
time talking about the structure of the ceiling beams, while I had to do a lot
of rough on-the-spot sketches. Apparently Horton wanted some rather unusual
mathematical shapes designed in the ceiling struts and in the foundations.
Trent admitted that some of the designs were highly innovative, but seemed
unnecessarily expensive, but Horton insisted.
 
During the discussion I had a
chance to talk to Miss Elizabeth. It seems she is an artist, a passion, she
said, she inherited from her mother. (I saw a large portrait of her mother,
posing with a then much younger Alexander Horton. Miss Elizabeth is the
striking image of her mother.) She has some designs of a giant front glass
window. Very unusual.
161764: We are still working on the design of the theatre. Yesterday, I saw
Miss Elizabeth at the local gallery. We later supped at the gallery's cafe. I
made an error in judgement of telling Brighton. He was very hostile about it.
161940: A terrible thing happened last night. Brighton was found murdered. Due
to Brighton's jealousy of me over the last week, the police interviewed me.
Since I was helping Trent with the plans last night I was soon freed from
suspicion. Rumour has it that Brighton was very drunk last night and quite
abusive to people. He probably ran into someone who wasn't very tolerant.
162216: Just arrived home after having an exquisite dinner at Elizabeth's. She
truly is beautiful. I will admit that I am somewhat smitten with her. This is
silly because she is unobtainable to me. Her father would never allow it. I
must cool things down before I get in trouble. The firm would fire me, at the
instant, if they knew about my feelings. Fortunately, the work on the theatre
design is progressing at an extremely fast rate and soon will be finished. Then
I will be able to avoid her while my feelings simmer down.
162596: Yesterday was an incredible day. Elizabeth accompanied her father to
the office and we had a chance for a private conversation. I told her it would
be best if we weren't so informal together and that it wasn't appropriate for
us to meet like we have been. She just laughed and kissed me. Just like that,
in the office. Goodness, if any of my superiors had seen us there would have
been a tremendous fuss. She then told me that, in her words, I had "delightful
properties" and that I was "valued quite highly in her affections".
162982: I spent last night in Elizabeth's arms. We went out for supper and then
I escorted her home, where I spent a most magical night. Truly, I love her. I
love her smell, her touch, her delicate laugh, her dark hair, and her beautiful
eyes.

One curious incident, though, puzzles me. After we made love I went to
the bathroom and upon leaving it almost walked into her father, whom I had
successfully avoided earlier in the evening. On seeing me, I expected a most
violent reaction, and my career to be ruined, but instead he just looked at me
with sad eyes, like he felt sorry for me.
163412: My romance with Elizabeth has been continuing steadily. I have managed
to keep it a secret from those at work although I think Trent suspects
something. I find her father's reaction, or lack of one, to our affair curious.
Last night I saw some of Elizabeth's pictures. To be honest they were rather
dreadfully morbid images of strange old cities. Others, which she had hidden,
were of the most fantastic and ghastly creatures. I don't think I shall tell
her I saw them, in case she might ask me my opinion. I cannot lie to those
beautiful eyes of hers.
163820: Today, we finished the designs of the theatre. Trent held a little
celebration, for us all, at his club. It is good that Horton is no longer a
client of ours. I now do not have the threat of dismissal spoiling my feelings
towards Elizabeth.
164008: Elizabeth made a most curious request of me. She wanted me to alter the
plans slightly. I told her about how I was only a draughtsman and not an
architect, and what the actual difference is, but she insisted. I now
understand what my father meant about not being able to tell a woman anything.
In the end I went to her father and he okayed the changes. I tried to tell him
that Trent should be the one to do the changes but he said I was to do it.
Still I think I will do it. Then perhaps she will let me see her pet tiger.
164392: I never really knew what a violent temper Elizabeth had, until a couple
of days ago. She gave even more changes to make to the plans, including a
secret passageway from the toilets, of all places. I went to Trent and showed
him the changes. When Elizabeth found out she was furious.
164608: I now have discovered the reason behind Elizabeth's quick temper and
increasing moodiness. Her father was, apparently, sick for several days, and
this morning he passed away. Elizabeth has obviously been replacing her grief
with anger. Hopefully, soon she will have a good cry and return to her normal
lovely self.
 
Elizabeth gave me more changes to make. They are very subtle
changes to some of the geometric shapes that were built into the ceiling and
foundations. I don't know why but these changes disturb me greatly.
164988: Elizabeth has been impossible the last few days. She gives more and
more changes, and then flies into great rages at the merest hint of objection.
Also my health has been failing due to my insomnia. Those changes she has been
forcing me to make are hideous to behold. The strangest thing is I don't even
know how drawn shapes on paper could be so disgusting anyway, and how they can
give me such terrible dreams.
165292: I think I am losing my mind. My nights are filled with nightmares,
especially about what that awful underground pit could be used for. Since I
have finished the changes, I haven't seen Elizabeth but I don't miss her. Oh,
Melissa. I am ashamed of my previous entry about you. You are more of a lady
than that whore ever was.

I haven't been into work for several days so I
expect I am unemployed, but considering what trouble that job brought me, I
don't really care.
165656: This section of the journal is missing.
165736: This room is a tribute to the now-faded glory of the theatre. The
still-smiling faces of forgotten productions stare out from faded posters at
you. An old grand staircase leads up, while the exit lies to the south. Small
private doors lead northeast and northwest.
165892: The anonymous faces smile back at you.
165924: These fine old stairs once would have been the focus of the entire
lobby. Unfortunately they are a bit decrepit now.
166000: How do you start the game?
166016: Cobwebs cover the whole row of dirty hooks. Looking closer you see that
one is a lot cleaner than the others.
166080: One hook stands out from the others because it is a lot cleaner, having
no cobwebs over it.
166136: This hook is a lot cleaner than the others.
166164: The secret passage leads down.
166182: Great, tax receipts from 1937. Riveting stuff.
166224: The little metal markers on the dial are all worn away. No one could
open this now.
166280: How do I open the safe?
166324: You can barely make anything out in here. The only source of
illumination is the light seeping in from the street-level windows. Not that it
really matters because all this room seems to contain is boxes and a couple of
barrels.
166464: An old electrical panel is mounted on the wall.
166496: Sitting on one of the boxes is your trusty pager, right where you left
it.
166548: Oddly, the barrels are filled with old stale popcorn.
166580: Hmm, popcorn doesn't age well.
166616: There is too much smog to the evening sunset.
166644: Boarded up buildings block your path.
166668: A dirty wispy type of mist that is half fog and three-quarters smog.
166712: It was the thing that your car used to drive on. When you had a car,
that is.
166760: This individual is very large and bulky, and is wearing heavy leather
clothing that is ripped in several places. He has very pale skin but dark
spooky eyes that stare at you with no trace of emotion (perhaps even life). You
can't help but notice that half of his mouth is sewn together. He emits a
rather unpleasant odour that is difficult to classify, but you concentrate more
on the sharp and deadly little knife he is holding.
167016: A vicious looking thug stands before you, wielding a deadly looking
knife. He seems quite smelly.
167080: It looks like it could cut through budding young land agents' throats
quite easily.
167144: How do I get past the street thug?
167168: This is a small room that has been sealed up. The windows have been
boarded over, but faint light enters through cracks. The booth smells very bad,
like old rotten meat.
167280: Once these rags would have been an old usher's uniform but now they are
just rags.
167336: Boxes of junk line the walls, making the narrow hallway even more
difficult to navigate through. Doors lead south and west, while the hallway
continues north.
167440: A quick rummage through the boxes finds nothing useful at all.
167488: The narrow hallway and its rows of boxes come to an end here. To the
north is the back exit of the theatre while the hallway continues south, and an
office door leads west.
167588: Unfortunately the door has been nailed shut from the other side. You
will never get that open.
167644: The office door has been nailed shut.
167668: You are behind the old theatre building in a small courtyard in the
centre of the city block. On all sides tall buildings block you in. Once an
alleyway allowed passage to the streets, but that alleyway was built over a
couple of decades ago, so now the large stage doors to the south are quite
useless. A small back entrance, however, lies to the southwest.
167888: The large stage doors are locked shut from the inside.
167920: The tall walls of the courtyard block your way.
168048: You are in a dream location. Soft light set a romantic mood.
168088: A very large, very comfortable bed. It could sleep five easily.
168128: Oh, what a heavenly babe.
168148: An outstanding beauty.
168168: A simply stunning example of the female gender.
168208: The body perfect.
168240: Here the grand staircase splits to the east and the west. You can also
go back down to the south.
168300: Below you is the theatre lobby.
168316: The stairs lead up to the east and west.
168340: It is a full-length picture of a distinguished gentleman in an
old-fashioned suit. He is standing in a wood-panelled room with an oaken door
and a large fireplace that has a roaring fire in it, casting flickering light
all around the room. Looking closer you can't help but feel that the background
room has been drawn with an incorrect perspective.
168560: A huge portrait dominates the northern wall.
168588: Seems oddly realistic in someplaces.
168612: Very distinguished and quite old. There is no clue as to the identity
of this character.
168668: The painted fireplace has a large burning fire in it.
168704: The painted oaken door is closed. Actually the door is very realistic.
It is almost as if you could reach out and touch it.
168780: The painted open door is open.
168800: A huge portrait dominates the northern wall. The painted door in it is
open showing a passage to the north.
168868: The painted oaken door is closed.
168892: A huge portrait dominates the northern wall.
168932: How to I stop the ghostly voice?
168976: This landing circles around the upper level of the lobby allowing you
to see down into it. The landing continues south and west, where it goes down
the lobby stairs. A set of double doors lead north to the theatre auditorium
itself, while a single finely carved wooden door leads east.
169144: Below you is the theatre lobby.
169160: This landing circles around the upper level of the lobby allowing you
to see down into it. The landing continues south and east, where it goes down
the lobby stairs. A set of double doors lead north to the theatre auditorium
itself.
169296: Below you is the theatre lobby.
169312: But there is no door to the west from here.
169340: The landing sweeps around the theatre's entrance hall. Here, at the
southern end, you are above the main doors, and you can look down to the lobby
below. The landing continues to the northeast and northwest.
169460: It's not safe to go down from here.
169484: Against the southern wall you can see some closed heavy curtains.
169528: Against the southern wall you can see a circular patterned window
surrounded by heavy curtains.
169588: Against the southern wall you can see some closed heavy curtains.
169628: The window has a very curious pattern on it. The pattern is impossible
to describe and as you look closer at it the more indistinct it gets, causing
you to lose your concentration.
169736: The light shining down from the circular window above you has created a
faint spotlight with a curious pattern on the floor.
169812: The circular window above must have a slightly concave surface because
it seems to have focused the curious pattern into a smaller version of itself.
Unfortunately you still can't make head or tail of its meaning.
169960: What is with this funny patterned window?
169988: This aisle runs north and south through the large theatre auditorium,
where you are surrounded by a sea of seats. Another aisle is to the west while
the stage is to the north. Double doors lead south.
170112: This aisle runs north and south through the large theatre auditorium,
where you are surrounded by sea of seats. Another aisle is to the east while
the stage is to the north. Double doors lead south.
170234: Here you stand upon a stage that once would have been graced by the
finest thespians in the country. However, now the only players upon this stage
are the spiders who spin the cobwebs, and who act out that never-ending saga of
life, death, and life again.

Anyway to the southeast and southwest aisles wind
their way through the endless sea of seats, to the north is the back stage
area, while down to the south is the orchestra pit.
170488: Far above you, you can see endless rows of lighting and girders.
170536: This depression would have been too small for anything but the most
basic of orchestras. Looking about you can see why this is called a pit. You
can go back up to the stage, or east to some walk-in storage cupboards.
170668: Far above you, you can see endless rows of lighting and girders.
170712: It looks dark and gloomy inside them.
170740: It is very dark inside the cupboards here. You imagine that this is
where the orchestra used to keep its equipment, but there is no sign of it here
now. The cupboards are empty except for the shadowy gloom. The orchestra pit
itself lies to the west and a gap in the east wall leads east.
170908: The creature is a intangible shadowy presence.
170960: How do I pass the shadow?
170988: This is a very dark place and you can barely make out passages heading
west and northwest.
171044: Light filters through from the cracks on the boards above you, that
form the stage. It is quite cramped here, and you have to bend over slightly as
you walk to avoid hitting your head on the low ceiling.

A passage leads
southeast from here into darkness.
171192: Littered on the ground are various small items that seem to have fallen
through the cracks above you.
171252: This is a finely carpeted stairway that leads down to a wooden door,
and up to the north.
171308: Below you is the stage and the theatre auditorium.
171360: Can I get to the western balcony seats?
171388: This is a cramped dimly-lit room, empty but for the rows of pictures
that are on the walls. A small door leads south.
171464: The pictures are very depressing. They are a collection of strange
landscapes of what looks like a monstrous city, with large stone buildings of
curious design. You have seen nothing like them before. Obviously they are
abstract pictures, because the angles the buildings are drawn at look
incorrect, almost like a bizarre perspective puzzle, where it is hard to tell
where the walls end and the street begins. The streets are empty of inhabitants
but you get the impression of great size and antiquity.
171764: A jumble of supports, ropes, and curtains divide the back stage in to a
maze of compartments. The general clutter isn't helped by the rolls and rolls
of canvas scenery backdrops. The stage doors, leading north, have been boarded
over, and you can see that the remains of stairs leading up have been pulled
down, so only the exit seems to be back south to the stage.
171980: Looking up you can see several doors above you. You would imagine that
there once would have been a landing there but it must have been pulled down
like the stairs.
172072: The stage doors have been nailed over.
172096: The stairs have been removed.
172120: Once stairs lead up, but sadly they have been removed.
172156: The stage doors have been nailed over.
172184: Once used to support things but you are not too sure what.
172224: Old and beginning to rot, but these things would have onced been used
to separate the various areas of the stage.
172292: Actually, looking up, you notice that the ropes go near some doors set
into the western wall high above you.
172364: These large canvas sheets would have had the set's backdrops painted on
them.
172404: You are suspended about five metres above the stage, clinging on to one
of the many ropes. Across a narrow space you can see some doors set in the west
wall that would have once lead onto a landing (which is long since gone). One
of the doors is very close by.
172556: You can only go west and down here.
172576: This room was probably once an old dressing room, but it is hard to
tell as scuff marks on the floor are the only traces of the room's original
furniture left. A door leads east, back to the rope.
172696: Seems like people were pushing heavy furniture about.
172736: The locker has seen better days. The fall has smashed it open,
rendering it useless as a container. It seems the snake must have crawled away,
as you can see no trace of its body.
172844: This is a small round amulet with a matching chain that is designed to
be worn. You're not too sure, but some mercenary instinct believes the amulet
is made of gold. In the centre of the amulet is an impressive inscription of
what looks to be a moon symbol.
173002: Its seems to be a cut-out of a review of a theatre show. As you quickly
read it through, one section in particular seems to stand out:

...but the
highlight of the show must have been the performance of the half time act of
Marcilax, Master of Magicks. His acts of illusion and prestidigitation were
simply wondrous and astounding to behold. Fortunately this reviewer had time to
interview Marcilax after the show. When complimented on his performance,
Marcilax modestly informed this reviewer that his success was partly due to the
setting itself. To quote him "...this very theatre seems to be a storehouse of
mystical energy. Normally when an abundance of mystical energy is centred in
one place it will condense into crystals of immense powers, but here in this
theatre it seems to be dispersed into the very walls. However one must still be
careful, if I was not protected by the enchantments weaved into my protecting
medallion, my very soul could be in jeopardy." Anyway, despite the rhetoric, we
can expect great things to come of this performer.
173644: This is a strangely coloured snake. You think it is a cobra. Certainly
the way it hisses at you seems to suggest it is very dangerous.
173736: How do I get rid of the snake?
173768: This is an old secret stairway that leads up and down. The area is
feebly lit by electrical lights set in the roof.
173840: The stairs descend into darkness.
173868: They emit a feeble glow.
173908: How do I get through the iron door?
173932: You have to go down into the pit first.
173956: The rough walls of the pit make an easy climb up and out of here. A
gloomy tunnel heads east.
174020: They provide easy hand holds to climb up out of here.
174052: You can see an indistinct blur of the beast's basic outline as it paces
back and forth in the pit.
174112: In the gloom, you can make the outline of some sort of transparent yet
very large creature that is trapped in the pit.
174184: How do I safely enter the pit?
174232: You are at a junction in a little network of tunnels. One tunnel heads
west back to the pit, while others branch northeast, southeast, and southwest.
174326: You have reached the western end of a large sewage drainage trench that
continues east quite some smelly distance. A passageway leads northwest, back
under the theatre.

This end of the trench seems to terminate at a large sluice
gate that opens into a drain leading further down into the muck.
174500: There is no way that you are going further down into the drain.
174536: The sluice gate is at the end of the trench, above a large drain.
174576: The large drain is at the end of the trench, below the sluice gate. It
leads down into darkness, but you have no wish to find out what is down there!
174660: The old trench has been crafted from old red bricks that have been
stained green by the continues slime than has filtered down it through the
decades.
174748: You shouldn't be in here. This is a BUG. Please report it to the
author. Go up to leave.
174808: You appear to be in the centre of the drainage trench, which leads east
and west from here. Above you, to the north, is a strange metal platform.
174896: You are on a metal platform, which grants a clear view of the entire
sewer (for what it is worth) that lies down to the south.
174972: You imagine the lever operates by pulling it.
175000: From out of the roof extends a long rusty lever.
175032: Here the drainage trench ends at a junction of small pipes, each
impassable. The trench leads west, while a tunnel leads southeast.
175120: This small northwest-southeast tunnel is covered in rotting sewage and
animal droppings. The tunnel ends at a unusual archway to the south-east.
175216: The archway's smoothly polished surface is distinctly out of place with
the rest of the surroundings.
175280: The rodents are slick and slimy, looking very vicious with their beady
little eyes and cruel little razor teeth. They quickly swarm over each other as
they move.
175380: You shouldn't be in here. This is a BUG. Please report it to the
author. Go up to leave.
175440: How do I get past the rats?
175472: How do I get cross the archway?
175508: Beyond the archway lies a small circular room of red brick, shaped,
oddly enough, like an Eskimo's igloo. Dominating the centre of the room is an
old iron cauldron, filled with an unknown bubbling liquid. All around the walls
are shelves filled with curious little vials and other knick-knacks that seem
to give you the impression of a witch's secret laboratory or the like. The only
exit appears to be back to the northwest through the archway.
175780: Searching through the stuff you find nothing really useful.
175824: This side of the archway is formed out of brick.
175860: Looking closer you realise that it is very hot but you can see no fire
or other form of heat source.
175920: Lying on the ground in front of the statue is a jewelled dagger.
175960: This is a small round crystal, with a circular pattern on it. It is
earthy brown in colour.
176024: Looking closer it seems to be either a very chunky soup or a very
watery casserole.
176076: It seems to be a simple silver wedding band.
176116: How do I get the jewelled dagger?
176160: This sinister and murky hallway leads from the southwest to the
northeast, where you can hear the sound of chanting. The chanting has a
sinister inflection to it and you can feel an undefinable fear rising up within
you.
176296: Should I investigate the chanting?
176316: The hallway opens out into a huge cavernous room, brightly lit by a
large sphere of light which floats above the centre of the floor. Standing
beside the light is a tall thin woman.
176444: You follow a winding tunnel and end up where you started.
176480: You are much deeper in the mine shaft here. The area has been widened
out into a cavern and there are signs that some major excavations occurred
here.
176568: The creature is humanoid and about five feet tall. However he is very
thin and his skin has hardened into rough black leather. His face has also
distorted into ugly pig-like features with solid black eyes. The eyes look back
at you intelligently but sadly.
176748: How do I free the goblin creature?
176770: A thick layer of dust everywhere shows that no one has been here for
quite a while, which is not surprising since there seems to be no way out of
here. A bricked-up doorway once led west from here.

Looking closer you realise
that there is an exit. A small hole has been knocked into the wooden wall to
the side of the bricked-up wall. The hole, which is small enough to crawl
through, leads northwest.
177020: The exit west from here has been bricked up.
177048: Below you is the stage and theatre auditorium.
177076: You are dirty enough as it is without poking around in the dust.
177116: The bricks form quite a sturdy wall, blocking the exit west.
177152: You seem to be crawling along inside a hollow in the wall separating
the theatre from the building next to it. It is very dirty in here, and the
lack of light makes it difficult to see anything clearly. The hollow continues
south from here, while a hole lies to the southeast.
177312: This narrow hollow, which exists in the wall separating the theatre
from its neighbouring building, continues north from here. However a large hole
leads west from here, into the neighbouring building itself.
177432: The hole is big enough to allow passage west from here.
177464: The hole is big enough to enter.
177484: There are hundreds of books here, but most of them have turn mouldy in
the damp air and the rest seem quite useless.
177552: This little recess appears to have been once a reading area. A small
reading table and chair are still here. The library continues to the south.
177644: It doesn't look very comfortable but a chair's a chair.
177680: You can see that all the strange glistening strands converge in the
centre of a large heap of rotting books that appear to have been made into a
nest.
177764: Its flesh is a sickly pulpy white colour, covered in hard ridges. At
one end (which you imagine must be its head) there are a lot of large black
dots which seem to be eyes and at the end is a strange bony point.
177896: They seem like large versions of something from a spider's web.
177932: Under one of the collapsed bookcases you can see the body of a large
slug.
177980: Its flesh was a sickly pulpy white colour, covered in hard ridges. The
flesh has now burst open and a foul-smelling ichor leaks out.
178088: How do you remove the slug?
178104: You are high above a side street on an old stone balcony. Once, long
ago when this part of the city wasn't abandoned, the view from here would have
been incredible. Now, instead of glittering lights and flashing signs, the view
is of old boarded-up shop fronts and ruined buildings.

You can go back through
the windows to the east or you can risk climbing up the outside wall.
178332: You can see a side street below you.
178356: Sadly, the evening sky is lost above clouds of smog.
178388: Unfortunately, you can see no way you can climb down, only up, and you
are too high up to jump.
178448: The view is pretty lousy from here.
178476: This narrow little stairway winds its way up to the west and down to
the east.
178524: This is a long wood-panelled corridor that goes north and south. A
narrow little staircase leads down to the east from here, while a door goes
west.
178616: The stairs only go down.
178632: Flat and wooden, doubtlessly like many thespians who would have graced
this theatre.
178684: This is a long wood-panelled corridor that goes south from here. Doors
lead north and west.
178744: This is a long wood-panelled corridor that goes north from here. Doors
lead south and west.
178804: This small room seems to be reserved for medical emergencies. The walls
are covered with old medical posters giving cheerful descriptions on how to
heal cuts, tend to burns, and deliver babies?! Healthy people can leave to the
south.
178948: These give details on how to treat accidents that could occur in the
average theatre.
178996: There is a bed here, for the infirm.
179016: It is written in a woman's handwriting. It seems to be addressed to
you. You had better read it.
179076: "For the effective relief of most severe pains. Prescription use only!"
says the label on the pill container.
179152: Something you wear on your ears. Doctors use them to listen to people's
heart beats. You remember most of them as being very cold.
179232: In here were stored many of the smaller props once used in the
theatre's production. Shelves full of junk line the walls. A door leads out to
the north.
179328: The junk includes vases, plates, plastic pot plants, bottles of beauty
lotions, magazines, hair brushes, etc... Hmm, nothing useful at all, unless you
run one of the television sales channels.
179476: How do I go up the prop room's trapdoor?
179504: You have made your way up into the attic of the theatre. Wooden studs
and crossbeams make progress through the room difficult but not impossible.
Cobwebs and thick dust line the area. The attic continues further to the north.
179648: Dust coats the crossbeams, and covers the thinly plastered floor here.
Looking through the cracks in some of the plaster, you can see that you are
high above the theatre auditorium itself. The attic continues south from here,
while to the north you notice a curious construction.
179812: Through cracks in the floor you can see the theatre auditorium is far
below you.
179864: One end is connected to the winch and the other is to the chandelier.
179904: Designed for simple turning.
179924: The chandelier is a large brass monstrosity covered with those little
sparkling crystals. It would look quite good if it weren't covered in dust and
cobwebs.
180032: What do I do with the attic winch?
180056: Stepping into this room is like journeying back in time to another era.
This room is filled with racks and racks of old costumes. The costumes range
from Imperial Rome to World War I uniforms. An exit leads east.
180192: The only door leads back out to the east.
180224: This mannequin is wearing a pirate costume, complete with eye patch and
cutlass.
180276: This mannequin is wearing the traditional cowboy costume, complete with
six-gun and hat.
180332: This mannequin is wearing the traditional gladiator costume, complete
with net and vicious trident.
180396: Bundled amongst some other scraps of clothing is an old gas mask.
180448: How do I stop the mannequins?
180480: This room seems to have contained music equipment. Battered violin
cases and coils of various types of strings litter the floor. For the less
musically inclined a door leads east.
180588: This rubbish has never interested you.
180616: A piano has been pushed up against one of the walls.
180652: It is one of those compact, stand up types, with wooden finishing and
little wheels at the bottom of it. The piano has a little holder on the front
where you would put the sheet music.
180760: The sheet music is called "The Soldier's Waltz". It is a
complex-looking piece of music by some guy, with a German sounding name, whom
you have never heard of.
180860: This is a rather posh little suite, probably used by the theatre's
owner or perhaps by an occasional guest star actor. The room's furniture is of
noticeably superior quality to the rest of the theatre, with a fine four-poster
bed. A fireplace is in the western wall. A door leads back to the east.
181040: The furniture is antique. Sadly, there is nothing special about it that
will help you in your predicament.
181108: The bed has seen a lot of use. Who knows what liaisons have been kept
in this room?
181160: The fireplace is black with soot. Looking closer you notice that the
chimney shaft continues both up and down from here.
181236: This room was once an office but all of the furniture has been removed,
leaving only a small fireplace in the west wall. A door once led east from here
but you can see that it has been completely boarded up.
181360: The only exit seems to be via the chimney.
181384: The door has been securely boarded up.
181408: The door has been securely boarded up.
181432: This sooty shaft seems to be the only access out of here. It continues
both up and down.
181488: In the middle of the room, straight out of a scene from a silly vampire
movie, is an old-style wooden coffin with brass fittings, on a mahogany stand.
181580: The door has been soundly boarded up.
181620: How do I get the shiny key?
181652: A huge boiler dominates this room. Its pipes extend through the walls,
ensnaring them. A shaft from the boiler leads up, but, strangely, there seems
to be no other exit out.
181764: The boiler would have once heated the entire theatre, but now its only
use is to provide an exit up and out of here.
181832: Against one of the walls is large dirty coal bin.
181864: It is a small lump of coal only a couple of centimetres across.
Actually it looks wrong for a lump of coal (not that you are an expert), in
that it seems almost spherical.
181972: Far below you, on the mist covered street, you can see the street thug
staring back up at you.
182032: It is almost sunset, and you can just make out some of the stars above
you.
182080: You would slide down the roof tiles and fall to your doom.
182112: There is nothing but sky above you.
182136: You have already seen more of the chimney than you ever would have
wished for.
182184: The tiles are too slippery to move over, making any movement other than
back down the chimney impossible.
182248: You silently ponder if you will ever walk amongst those city streets
again.
182296: This poor creature looks a bit battered and beaten. Its feathers are
all dishevelled and it looks like it hasn't eaten for a week.
182384: Does the crow do anything useful?
182404: You conclude that this must be some kind of observatory, after all,
what else could it be? However, why is it that instead of the usual dome, the
roof just has a strangely patterned window? Also, instead of the normal studs
and crossbeams, the exposed wooden beams of the walls are set at bizarre
angles. It gives you the impression that you are inside a large multi-sided
mathematical shape. An opening leads south.
182676: The net effects of the curiously angled beams of the walls is a
suspension of the firm belief that up is up and down is down.
182748: The circular window has a pattern that is most peculiar. The more you
look at it the less you can see anything discernible about it. It is as if the
very act of observing it causes it to swirl in chaotic patterns. No, that can't
be it. It's just a funny pattern.
182904: The clear lens is about the size of a small plate.
182936: What is the telescope for?
182964: The lens is about the size of a small plate. Imprinted onto the lens is
a strange pattern.
183056: This is a small round crystal, milky white in colour. It appears to
have a star shaped pattern in it.
183120: You are standing on what seems to be someone's front lawn. A gravel
driveway winds its way south while hedges block all other directions. To the
north you can see a large mansion. The upper stories are ablaze.
183248: As you start down the driveway, everything suddenly goes blurry. When
you stumble back, your vision clears.
183316: It is just grass, although it is neatly trimmed and well cared for.
183356: The driveway goes to the south.
183376: The hedges block the view (and your passage) to the surrounding area.
183424: The upper stories are well ablaze, but the lower stories seem
relatively safe (for the moment).
183484: Smoke circles around in the air making it difficult to breathe, but
that is the only visible trace of the fire here in the long hallway. Doors and
stairs lead off in all directions, but the safest one is to the south which
leads outside. You notice that a trail of blood goes down some stairs.
183656: The fire would make it dangerous to go wandering off too far in that
direction.
183700: The stairs go up and down.
183720: A trail of blood goes downstairs.
183756: This was a large wine cellar that has been cleared out and put to a
more sinister use. Large tables filled with strange paraphernalia are dotted
about the room.
183852: It wouldn't be a good idea to turn your back on those bitches.
183892: It wouldn't be a good idea to turn your back on those bitches.
183936: I think you have more pressing concerns than that.
183968: A beautiful young woman stands here, with a pistol in her hand, and a
cruel expression on her face.
184032: She has long dark hair and cruel eyes. She seems quite capable of using
the pistol in her hand. You can't help but notice there are many similarities
in appearance between her and the old hag.
184156: It is the same charming individual who stabbed you in the face a few
minutes ago. Curiously you can see that in many ways she is very similar to the
younger woman.
184256: The old woman from the theatre ceremony is here as well.
184288: A nasty looking, high calibre weapon.
184332: This room is a tribute to the now-faded glory of the theatre. The
still-smiling faces of forgotten productions stare out from faded posters at
you. An old grand staircase leads up, while the exit lies to the south. Small
private doors lead northeast and northwest.
184488: You have no time to explore what lies up the stairs.
184516: You have no time to explore what lies up the stairs.
184544: Actually, this room is two stories high. You can see a landing going
around the walls. The staircase goes to this landing. The southern wall above
the theatre doors in shrouded in darkness.
184660: The anonymous faces smile back at you.
184692: These fine old stairs once would have been the focus of the entire
lobby. Unfortunately they are a bit decrepit now.
184768: Ending the game.
184780: Hooks line the walls here, where once people would have hung their
coats and hats, now they are home for only cobwebs. The lobby lies to the
southwest.
184868: Cobwebs cover the whole row of dirty hooks, which all look the same.
184912: Judging from the desk and lots of papers everywhere you assume this
must have been once the manager's office. Doors lead to the southeast and to
the north.
185000: You have no time to explore what is north of here.
185026: Great, tax receipts from 1937. Riveting stuff.
185068: The desk, like the rest of the office, is covered in papers.
185184: You can barely make anything out in here. The only source of
illumination is the light seeping in from the street level windows. Not that it
really matters because all this room seems to contain is boxes and a couple of
barrels.
185324: The old barrels are empty.
185340: The neighbourhood outside the theatre has deteriorated steadily over
the last three decades, to the state of a slum (not that you would ever use
that word, of course). Now a slight mist covers the litter-strewn streets. The
street heads east and west into the murky twilight.
185500: There is too much smog to the evening sunset.
185528: Not in this neighbourhood! Use the car.
185556: Not in this neighbourhood! Use the car.
185584: Boarded up buildings block your path.
185608: A dirty wispy type of mist that is half fog and three-quarters smog.
185656: This car has served you well over the years, and you have grown quite
attached to it.
185704: Your car is parked outside here.
