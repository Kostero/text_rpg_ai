16346: Nothing to do!
16381: o. You have won
16543: fhn[Your interpreter does not provide "undo". Sorry!]
16640: Please give one of the answers above.
16671: It is now pitch dark in here!
16698: I beg your pardon?
16716: dxn[You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
16758: ehn[Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
16830: Sorry, that can't be corrected.
16859: Think nothing of it.
16880: "Oops" can only correct a single word.
16914: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
16965: As good-looking as ever.
16989: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
17052: You can hardly repeat that.
17077: You can't begin with a comma.
17105: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
17180: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
17248: I didn't understand that sentence.
17318: I didn't understand that number.
17347: You can't see any such thing.
17374: You seem to have said too little!
17403: You aren't holding that!
17427: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
17467: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
17507: I'm not sure what "
17542: You excepted something not included anyway!
17578: You can only do that to something animate.
17613: That's not a verb I recognise.
17643: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
17697: You can't see "
17740: I didn't understand the way that finished.
17835: Nothing to do!
17852: There are none at all available!
17926: Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which exactly?
18886: Please answer yes or no.
18912: Are you sure you want to quit?
18948: Are you sure you want to restart?
18980: Failed.
19000: Restore failed.
19017: Ok.
19035: Save failed.
19050: Ok.
19068: The game file has verified as intact.
19100: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupted (unless you
are playing it with a very primitive interpreter which is unable properly to
perform the test).
19230: Transcripting is already on.
19287: Transcripting is already off.
19336: Score notification on.
19357: Score notification off.
19380: You have visited:
19408: Objects you have handled:
19433: None.
19817: You are carrying nothing.
19866: Taken.
19877: You are always self-possessed.
20262: You're carrying too many things already.
20446: Dropped.
20556: Removed.
20645: You can't put something on top of itself.
20722: You lack the dexterity.
20803: Done.
21002: You can't put something inside itself.
21093: Done.
21395: Wrahn seem interested.
21614: You can only get into something freestanding.
21736: But you aren't in anything at the moment.
21850: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
21952: You can't go that way.
22138: is now in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gives long
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
22240: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).
22328: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
22642: Darkness, noun. An absence of light to see by.
22773: But it's dark.
22790: You find nothing of interest.
22826: But it's dark.
22917: You find nothing of interest.
24087: . Not bad.
24105: That was a rhetorical question.
24132: This dangerous act would achieve little.
24166: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
24202: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
24239: That seems unnecessary.
24262: Keep your mind on the game.
24287: What a good idea.
24306: You smell nothing unexpected.
24333: You hear nothing unexpected.
24358: You taste nothing unexpected.
24393: Keep your hands to yourself!
24418: You feel nothing unexpected.
24443: If you think that'll help.
24469: Digging would achieve nothing here.
24536: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
24569: You would achieve nothing by this.
24598: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
24631: But there's no water here to carry.
24662: Oh, don't apologise.
24684: Real adventurers do not use such language.
24719: Quite.
24730: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
24763: There's not enough water to swim in.
24794: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
24858: You achieve nothing by this.
24946: You wave, feeling foolish.
25096: You are unable to.
25115: Nothing obvious happens.
25138: That would be less than courteous.
25176: Is that the best you can think of?
25205: That's not a direction.
25228: Not that way you can't.
25260: Keep your hands to yourself.
25285: You achieve nothing by this.
25319: Futile.
25331: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
25383: You talk to yourself a while.
25410: This provokes no reaction.
25438: There is no reply.
25457: Nothing is on sale.
25476: Your singing is abominable.
25502: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
25539: Time passes.
25554: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
47331: Writing on a cube is such a fiddly process that you need to be holding
it in your hand first.
47401: You would need some powerful implement for that.
47455: If a burin could write in a spell book, you wouldn't need the gnusto
spell!
47522: You cannot write just anything on the magic parchment of a scroll: you
can only "copy" a spell to it.
47598: Graffiti is banned.
47619: You need to be holding the burin to copy a spell.
47666: If a burin could write in a spell book, you wouldn't need the gnusto
spell!
47732: You can only copy spells to scrolls.
47767: The scroll is already full of incantation.
47798: The scroll is not blank, only illegible.
48250: You always know that spell.
48614: Unlike scrolls, spell books are magically guarded against the 'theft' of
their lore.
48689: Your spell fizzles vaguely out.
48717: A gnusto spell would require close scrutiny of the scroll it is to copy:
which you do not seem to be holding.
48827: Your spell fails, as you have no spell book.
48920: Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of
48976: are inscribed, glowing even more brightly then the book itself. The
book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However, the scroll on which it
was written vanishes as the last word is copied.
49178: is always open to the right place, but it is also always closed. This
eliminates tedious leafing and hunting for spells. Many lives have been saved
by this magical innovation.
49520: The scroll has faded, and you cannot read it.
49553: The scroll reads "
49955: Nothing happens.
50008: Nothing happens.
50246: Your training is such that you can only memorise such a spell with the
aid of a spell book containing it.
50323: You have no text of that spell to copy.
50357: You haven't learned that spell, if indeed it is a spell.
50405: You haven't access to that spell, if indeed it is a spell.
50571: At the moment, even the simplest questions confuse you.
50694: You need to be holding the coin first.
50733: You throw it away into the darkness.
50769: You toss the coin, and it lands... on its edge, amazingly.
50814: You toss the coin, and it comes up... blank, since neither side is
marked.
50874: There is a brief, blinding flash of light.
50910: The spell, not designed for living creatures, goes sour.
50955: The spell dissipates vaguely.
51106: There is a brief moment of deep darkness.
51142: The spell, not designed for living creatures, goes sour.
51187: The spell dissipates vaguely.
51278: ixm but slowly fades back to normality. Still,
51353: The world is open already.
51379: It might be a boon to surgeons if it worked, but it doesn't.
51432: It doesn't need opening.
51460: ddgixn opens obediently. Like swatting a fly with a sledge hammer, if
you ask me.
51569: The world is closed already.
51594: Happily, that is unnecessary.
51625: It doesn't need locking.
51690: That must be either vegetable or mineral.
51725: You give yourself a mild headache.
51802: That must be either vegetable or mineral.
51837: You give yourself a mild headache.
51920: Searching through the furniture, which is good for nothing but firewood
now, you come across an old cedarwood box, which you pick up for a closer look.
52181: A pair of handsome brown wings suddenly appears on the horse's powerful
shoulders. The horse turns in a complete circle, a look of puzzlement on his
face.
52295: He is mainly thinking about oats. Partly who you are and what you're up
to, but mainly oats.
52384: You ride around for a while, exercising the horse, but soon enough he
tires of this and pointedly brings you back to the oats. Obligingly you
dismount and he begins grazing again.
52509: You begin to ride north. Then, slowly at first but with increasing
sureness, the horse begins beating its powerful wings. You rise majestically
through the air, sailing gracefully across a chasm where the hills fall away.
The horse lands gently on the far side and deposits you, taking to the skies
again.
52798: Lucky you got to it before the horse did. As you turn it over in your
hands, it seems undamaged.
52871: What would you want with all those oats?
52909: The spell dies away in vain.
52935: Your elbows twitch, but there is no other effect.
53037: The spell dies away in vain.
53062: What wings?
53086: The Enchanter giveth, and the Enchanter taketh away. The horse looks
disconsolate but returns to the oats.
53286: The snake hisses angrily!
53330: The snake is replaced by a clump of daffodils.
53380: The snake is transformed into a huge, winged serpent, a dragon which
bellows and leaps out into the chasm, backwinging furiously... and knocking you
over the edge quite by accident.
53512: Horrid reptilian thoughts insinuate their way into you.
53559: The slipperiness of its skin is only one of many reasons why this is
ill-advised.
53622: The snake won't let you near that cube!
53654: The tortoise (slowly) turns its neck to look at you (stupidly).
53717: Just how safe do you want your surroundings to be?
53778: The tortoise seems to be incapable of expressing surprise, but is now
soaring away high in the sky. Something rather grubby is left behind.
53880: For a moment you think there is nothing there, as you chew
absentmindedly on a leaf. But somewhere inside the tortoise is a sense of
wonder at the amazing blue canopy of the sky.
54011: Your parents always warned you not to pick up casual acquaintances met
on the road.
54111: A tortoise-feather flutters to the ground before you!
54258: There is a loud bang in your ear, but no other effect.
54305: There is no further effect.
54335: Nothing happens, possibly because those butterflies on the other side of
the hill keep distracting you.
54462: There is a brief silence, but no other effect.
54509: Pardon?
54569: Those wretched butterflies finally shut up.
54630: Before your eyes, the scroll begins to repair itself, failing only at
the very last tear. Not quite perfect perhaps, but certainly a readable, if
torn scroll.
54749: "Eating your words" is notoriously dangerous for a wizard. Rearranged in
the stomach, a spell might do anything!
54862: The iron door stands open.
54887: The iron door is unlocked but shut.
54914: A heavy iron door bars the cave mouth.
54972: As you gaze into the perfect blue of the sapphire, you feel your mind
begin to reel. Unable to bear the naked sight of perfection, you look away,
ashamed. As you do so, the sapphire cracks and wastes away to thin hot dust.
But something remains, something in your mind...
55174: Trying to make everything perfect was a little too ambitious.
55221: Oh, don't be too hard on yourself.
55253: Your spell is not powerful enough to restore the lost pages.
55349: Something bars your way, and you hear the scales jangling militantly.
You were trying to steal its coins!
55434: Something bars your way, and you hear the scales jangle slightly with
energy.
55546: A fair-sized pair of scales hangs from a bracket in the cave wall.
55602: The scales are balanced.
55629: The left-hand side is higher.
55652: The right-hand side is higher.
55678: There are left and right hand pans, which you should refer to
individually.
55765: The pans gleam with what almost seems greed, and somehow they contrive
to nudge your hand past them with your worthless and boring item.
55978: The scales come into balance.
56125: The spell fizzles away.
56148: It's a matter of opinion, isn't it?
56222: , turns into a featureless white cube just as the cyclops was about to
hit you with it. Mightily embarrassed by this, he drops the cube and runs off!
56357: Nothing obvious happens. Perhaps
56421: The spell fizzles away.
56444: It's a matter of opinion, isn't it?
56563: Nothing obvious happens.
56592: Suddenly, a tarantula races up your arm to your throat! Perhaps it was
unwise to gizbru something you were actually holding.
56686: Nothing happens. Perhaps that's just as well, after the last time.
56812: Does the term "death wish" mean anything to you?
56854: The cyclops bellows with glee as your spell has no effect. (After all,
he wouldn't be "dangerous" if an urbzig spell worked on him, would he?)
56962: He roars incoherently, swinging the mace!
57009: Feeling that he's given you quite long enough to explain why you made
such a mess of his life, he swings the great mace maniacally down on you!
57118: The cyclops leaps and bellows!
57148: Whirling the mace, the cyclops jabbers at you incoherently.
57196: yhn
The cyclops is losing patience (the appropriate cyclops word is
untranslatable into English, but approximately means "forbearance in not
smashing all nearby skulls").
57317: The cyclops jabs you with the mace, almost breaking your rib.
57382: Not until the carpet's on the ground, you can't.
57445: Not until the carpet's on the ground, you can't.
57489: Mysteriously, the carpet rucks and pulls until you're thrown off. It
settles back on the white floor with a contented sigh.
57581: The carpet rises suddenly, crashing into the roof of the cave and
throwing you back off again. Painfully.
57673: The carpet rises suddenly into the fluffy white clouds, and after a
headlong journey deposits you...
57773: Not while you're on it!
57848: It is labelled "First Prize"!
57883: It is labelled "Nineteenth Prize".
57912: "You lose," says the ticket, with a smily face. "Try again!"
58150: It would be cheating to see what's written on the curled up tickets
still in the board.
58217: "Get outta here, bub!", the barker says, disgusted.
58274: "Roll up!  Roll up!  One silver piece for three goes!"
58324: "Come on, then!  Just a silver coin gets you three!"
58370: exn
"Think what you could win, all for one silver coin!"
58417: "This could be your lucky day!"
58451: "None of that!" snaps the barker angrily, putting you off your study
habits. He mutters about "Enchanter cheats", but under the circumstances you
decide to let the insult pass.
58600: The barker stabs you in the chest with his finger. "That's a silver coin
to you, bub!"
58691: That ticket's already taken.
58787: The barker looks metaphysically embarrassed. "Um, Inform's object
creation system seems not to have worked."
59032: Give it to me if you want to play it."
59068: The barker is burly, and won't let you tamper with the board.
59121: No way. He must weigh twice what you do.
59169: "Just one silver coin and a prize could be yours!"
59217: He blows the dust off it. "Genuine antique, that."
59267: "Good quality merchandise," he says, in a way that suggests he can only
spell one of those three words.
59352: "Three tickets for one silver coin!"
59381: "Just play the game, bub."
59412: The barker glowers at you.
59481: With very bad grace, the barker shoves the cuddly toy elephant into your
arms.
59570: With concealed relief, the barker shoves the featureless white cube into
your hands.
59659: "You've had enough goes already!" he growls. No wonder trade is bad.
59723: "What do you call that? One silver coin to play!"
59784: Not a chance, sunshine."
59857: Gleefully the barker snatches the gold coin. "Sorry bub, no change.
Business is slack today!"
59926: Grudgingly the barker takes the silver coin and stands back to let you
at the board, arms folded.
60010: He's not that much of an animal.
60039: His problem is listening, not hearing.
60073: For a moment his hair seems to comb itself. Irritated, he ruffles it
again, and the spell dies an ignominious death.
60174: The barker's mind is a heap of grumbles about lost prizes and scrawny
Enchanters.
60241: "Hope that scrawny Enchanter doesn't pick 2306!" thinks the barker
(slowly).
60302: "If that mark does win, hope it's only worthless old 5802," ponders the
barker.
60366: "Hands off those prizes!"
60395: "Hands off those prizes!"
60423: "Hands off those prizes!"
60456: Let me get this straight. You, the enchanter who defeated Krill, the
head of the Borphee Guild himself... are attempting to grow wings on a pink
cuddly elephant?
60577: Woolly.
60593: The spell backfires, painfully.
60627: You know that spell too well for your mind to be able to accept the
change.
60837: You really can't fault Helistar on this one. Death is absolutely
immediate, like a sudden blackout curtain...
60925: Nothing quite happens... and yet you feel enormously more confident as
you go about this dangerous world.
61012: Your foresight in preparing a resurrection was wasted. The tangled magic
of the Balance Room coiled around your puny enchantment like a constricting
serpent.
61182: With great foresight you prepared yourself for resurrection... Your mind
feels a little weaker, but at least you're alive.
61309: You can make out nothing to the west.
61347: A brief shower of gratuitous fireworks spells out: 

The masterly
Enchanter trilogy was written by Marc Blank, Dave Lebling and Steve Meretzky.
61458: A lengthy shower of artistically justified fireworks spells out: 

The
masterly Enchanter trilogy was written by Jane Austen, Emily Bronte and Edgar
Allen Poe.
61586: The chanting is too quiet to make out.
61615: The endlessly repeating threnody of the monks tells of the legend of one
who will some day enlighten their order, and so be taken up to a higher plane.
He (or she, presumably) is known as The Four-Cubed One.
61771: The Temple is featureless and unbroken. Perhaps the top is open, because
the sound must come from somewhere... but you wouldn't bet on it.
61885: The huge temple remains impassive at your relatively puny enchantment.
61970: The temple shakes, but then is still again.
62022: White light plays over your hands and possessions, but then all is still
again.
62079: The temple shakes and white light bathes you. Smoothly it unfolds itself
in a four-dimensional way your senses can barely comprehend. All you know is
that when it is over, you find yourself in...
62234: You stand outside an enormous temple in the shape of a perfect,
featureless white cube, four hundred feet on a side. From somewhere within you
hear the
62386: It's only an image.
62416: Nice try, but it is protected from enchantment.
62451: However dusty it is, the podium is still protected from casual
enchantment.
62521: No substitute for old-fashioned hard work, sometimes, and after much
patient (sneezy) scrubbing, the podium appears in its true white glory. Set
into it are four sockets, arranged in a two by two square.
62678: You'll have to say which socket you mean. (Let's call them "top left",
"bottom right" and so on.)
62826: The sockets are proof against magic.
62974: The socket rejects that.
63000: There is already a cube in that socket.
63043: With much struggle, you manage to pull the cube away.
63131: As you place the final cube into the sockets, you feel imbued with
celestial wisdom (more so than usually). You find yourself growing to the
height of the cube, so that you pull the balances back level by hand, and then
you grow still further, out of the temple until it is but a cube in your hand,
and you are a giant towering over the land. 

Then, of course, you wake up,
glumly realising it's time to go to your job at the new Borphee Laboratories
and all those Wheatstone bridge experiments. But at least you can dream about
the old days.
63510: The sockets are all full now, but that doesn't mean anything's happened.
63563: The cube is a predictably perfect fit in the socket.
63846: a    

You feel a little confused as to how you got here. Something to
do with Helistar!  That's right, and how the world is so far off balance
nowadays, after the Great Change.
64001: Scientist.
64014: Spellbreaker.
64029: Sorcerer.
64042: Enchanter.
64059: Enchanter.
64094: You feel fine, and your memory is unimpaired.
64132: You feel shaky after your brush with death, but your mental faculties
seem sound.
64194: For someone who has died twice, you're in reasonable shape.
64261: Your memory isn't what it was.

Copyright (c) 1994, 1995, 1996 by Graham
Nelson.
66992: Score:
67000: Moves:
67008: Time:
67016: You can't go that way.
67120: A perfect white cube, four inches on a side.
67160: This is a magical burin, used for inscribing objects with words or runes
of magical import. Such a burin also gives you the ability to write spell
scrolls.
67296: Helistar is your colleague, an Enchanter like you who has been much on
your mind lately. She has been investigating some very dark magic indeed, and
seems not to be around any more. You feel rather vague about the details.
67452: A burin is an engraving and writing tool.
67522: No, it's gone.
67608: The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the
earth. Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is
tempered by its fear of light. No grue has ever been seen by the light of day,
and few have survived its fearsome jaws to tell the tale.
67800: According to Chambers English Dictionary, a grimoire is "a magician's
book for calling up spirits".
68424: A round unstamped disc, presumably part of the local currency.
68588: Until quite recently, someone lived here, you feel sure. Now the
furniture is matchwood and the windows are glassless. Outside, it is a warm,
sunny day, and grasslands extend to the low hills on the horizon.
68736: There's only the one room: better go "out".
68772: The box bears the calligraphed initial H.
68802: This must be the grimoire of dangerous spells kept by your irresponsible
friend Helistar. Many pages are missing, but a few spells remain:
68904: The grasslands sway over low hills in all directions: it is a peaceful
wilderness, broken only by this hut and a faint path to the north.
69000: You wander around for a while but end up back at the hut.
69040: A pleasant pocket valley in the grassy hills, through which a trail runs
north-to-south.
69104: The trail runs out to nothing, and you retreat for fear of getting so
lost you couldn't find the hut again by nightfall.
69188: You wander around the pleasant valley, but are afraid to lose sight of
the trail.
69268: The road ends suddenly at a wide chasm. The road leads upward to the
north, and you can see it continuing on the southern side of the chasm.
69368: The chasm is too perilous to approach. The only safe way is up and to
the north.
69424: Lying in a tight coil at the edge of the chasm is a hissing snake.
69472: It has some V-markings, some scaly parts, colours from grey to
reddish-brown. Is that any help?
69544: Beside a clump of daffodils is a featureless white cube.
69584: A featureless cube rests where the snake took off from.
69624: The snake appears to be curled around a featureless white cube.
69668: The road crosses the top of a ridge here, sloping downwards to the south
and the northwest. A track diverges to east.
69752: A tortoise ambles along the road, extremely slowly.
69800: It looks as if the tortoise was eating something - once it might have
been a scroll, but now it lies there, chewed up like a lettuce leaf.
69896: Possibly your rarest, and also least valuable, possession.
69940: This is a cave mouth, at one end of a road which winds southeast over
rising ground. The entrance west to the caves is a dark tunnel, and only a
footpath runs further north, into gorse.
70068: It just looks like an ordinary heavy iron door.
70104: Clotted in the mud beside the door is a perfect sapphire.
70156: A wide but shallow cave not far inside the hill. There is no obvious
exit, except for the way you came in.
70232: The only way is back "out" through the iron door.
70268: Balanced on a rock formation is a featureless white cube.
70340: A huge buck-toothed cyclops menaces you, armed with a heavy mace!
70388: It looks much too heavy for you to even lift.
70420: A featureless white cube lies where the cyclops dropped it.
70464: The footpath from the cave mouth runs into dense, impenetrable gorse
bushes. Perhaps it wasn't so much a footpath as a rill in the earth where roots
wouldn't take; anyway, there's no way but back south.
70608: Slung over one of the gorse bushes is a beautiful red carpet.
70652: This is a carpet of unusual design. It is red, beautifully woven and
bears a pattern of cubes.
70772: But the contemptuous-looking barker is doing a very poor trade: hardly
anyone wants his first prize, the big cuddly toy elephant, or even his
nineteenth prize, a featureless white cube.
70900: Everywhere, the crowds of jabbering natives block your way to all the
good stalls. In fact, the only one you can get at is this dismal lottery.
71000: There are a hundred holes each way, making, um, let's see, yes, ten
thousand tickets in all. Still, there are nineteen prizes, so your odds must
be, oh, well, not too awful anyway.
71132: Behind the barker is a huge drilled board, and inside each little
numbered hole is a rolled-up lottery ticket.
71212: A boxer gone to seed who failed as a magician all down the coast, that'd
be your guess.
71276: This is a crowded, noisy bazaar. Directly in front of you is the
lottery!
71328: This is a crowded, noisy bazaar. Directly in front of you is the
lottery!
71380: Pink, cuddly, toy, elephant. Says it all, really.
71420: Wouldn't you like to win it?
71444: Pink, cuddly, toy, elephant. Says it all, really.
71532: This is a room of bones. Shoulder blades make up the floor, skulls the
walls and leg-bones the door frames. The west exit leads into darkness, but the
doorway to the north opens onto a seemingly normal scene.
71680: Some magical force blocks your way, as though that doorway led into
adventures from your past which you cannot rejoin now.
71764: You are almost treading on a worthless scroll.
71816: This is the end of a long track winding through desolate hills, which
runs back west up to the ridge.
71888: It's much like every other gigantic temple in the shape of a featureless
white cube you've ever seen. No obvious way in.
71972: This seems to be the inside of a featureless white cube, forty feet on a
side. The air is stale and there is no exit.
72060: The image of a pair of scales hangs high in the air. One pan is much
lower than the other.
72124: Far below the scales, in the centre of the "floor", is a
predictably-shaped podium, but it is so dusty and cobwebbed that you can't see
what it once was.
72232: As predicted, it is cubical.
72256: Far below the scales, in the centre of the "floor", is a
predictably-shaped podium. Set into it are four sockets, arranged in a two by
two square.
72412: It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
