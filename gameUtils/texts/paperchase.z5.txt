kills you - but you make it!
43240: The sports instructor blocks your way and pushes you back out into the
corridor. "Only students allowed in the sports hall!" he tells you, and goes
back inside.

get out of here!"
43445: The instructor comes up to you. "To pass PE", he says, "You've gotta run
forty laps. That's five miles!"
43547: "Come on," he says as he runs past you, "I expect you've got better
things to do than hang around here all day!"
43630: "To pass PE", he says, "You've gotta run forty laps. That's five miles!"

You fail miserably.

the Chemistry exam! Now get out of my lab!"

exam! Sit down and start."

44638: The psychologist looks up as you enter.
44676: "Oh, it's you again," he says disappointedly.

with inkblots. "What do these suggest to you?" he asks.
44836: "Very interesting," says the psychologist.
44881: The psychologist says, "Give it to me!"
44934: The psychologist takes the magazine and thanks you.

bring me a copy of 'Psychiatry Today'."

will do anything to prevent these conclusions being made public."

45409: "You're not a registered student, so I can't help you," he says.
45474: "That's not enough for your tuition!" he says.
45543: "That seems to be in order," he says. "You can have your transcript
receipt now."

transcript receipt until you've finished the curriculum.
45704: The bursar takes your coin and bites it. "Thankyou," he says, "You now
owe me a silver piece for your report transcript."

that results from her chain-smoking.
55312: On the cover you can see, "English Language and Literature, Paper 1".

looking extremely hassled, is rushing around attempting to clean up the mess.
There is a door to the west.
55496: This office has only one exit; to the east.
55528: This young man is busily engaged in the hopeless task of tidying the
records office.
