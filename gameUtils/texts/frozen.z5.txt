43735: Everyone is still, apparently they can't think and type at the same
time.
43788: The students sit at their desks, still as statues.
43829: On second thought perhaps they aren't thinking, they're still enough to
be statues.
43993: No matter how you strive, they refuse to move an inch.
44135: You'd have better luck moving the students.
44220: Just as your about to give up in frustration the bag starts moving, and
you swing it onto your shoulder before it stops again.
44322: The bag hangs in the air, smugly defying the gravity that still
imprisones you.
44391: It still smells like the chocolates you had at lunch yesterday.
44451: In his current condition he might as well be welded to the floor.
44542: You'd have to cut his arm off to get at it.
44693: A determined tug manages to free it from whatever hold was on it however
and it shoots towards you, striking you in the chin.
44785: The desk calendar hovers in mid air, roughly parallel to the ground,
exactly like you released it.
44859: With considerable effort you manage to turn the desk calendar over,
achieving exactly the same result as before.
44949: The laboratory door in the southeast is closed.
44984: The door is shut tightly and probably locked.
45023: A bright light shines through the open doorway.
45213: Something is very wrong here.
45243: It's hard to tell without getting closer, but it looks almost
insubstantial.
45496: As soon as your hand touches the surface of the sphere, the lights,
until now peacefully swirling, rush onto your hand and from there spread over
your entire body.  The lights swarm into your eyes, and a moment of
disorientation follows.  An instant later the lights explode outwards and you
find yourself falling to the floor with a thud.
45765: If only there was something you could stand on.
45810: Lights dance and swirl before your eyes and for a moment you fear you've
gained a concussion for your trouble, but after a moment you realize that the
lights you're seeing are the same ones that formed that sphere, now spread out
and filling an entire room.
46307: An arched doorway leads southeast.
46560: Maybe you should've stuck to one pattern at a time.
46809: A sudden whirlwind springs up, as all the dust lying about spins itself
into a vortex that eventually coelesces into a human figure.
47014: There is a feeling of intense acceleration with bright lights flashing
past you and a dull roaring in your ears.  And there, ahead, a great wall. 
Looming closer, closer, you're not slowing, Closer, you're going to Hi.....


With a violent start you find yourself back in the computer lab, the other
students typing away, your story staring you in the face, and the ending
surfacing in your mind like a whale.  Looks like you'll have it done on time
after all.
47664: That you can never return home.
47856: You open your eyes a moment later to find yourself back in the computer
lab at school, but tickling the back of your mind is the feeling of a hard
stone floor pressed up against you, and you know that you'll be returning to
that dusty basement soon.
48486: Quirking an eyebrow in puzzlement, she graces you with a wry smile as
your brash advances net you nothing but dust.
48587: Smiling sadly at your offering, she merely shakes her head in mute
refusal.
48652: As she looks at the picture a feeling of homesickness, and the
incongruous image of silver sand, comes over you.
48731: Her expression is that of polite interest as she looks upon your
offering.
48799: Her gaze upon this picture evokes in you a feeling of something
irretrievably lost mixed with the feeling of a new discovery, as well as a
picture of silver sand.
48917: Her smile is wry as you show her this picture, and a feeling of safety,
and discovery overtakes you, accompanied by a vision of silver sand.
49331: Curiously none of the lights are even approaching a doorway on the south
wall.
49647: The cellar lies back to the southwest and another doorway lies south.
49965: The cellar lies back to the west and other doorways lie north and south.
50129: You put the sand back in the bottle.
50417: The cellar lies back to the northwest and another doorway lies north.
50491: Since you don't know what any of these things do, don't you think you
should leave them alone?
50717: You only have a moment to ponder it though, as you swiftly pass out from
the fumes, never to awaken again.
50810: A bottle labeled 'Rexal' catches you eye amidst all the other clutter.
50881: You pick up some of the junk on the floor, but finding nothing useful,
give it up as futile.
51301: Instead of the reflection you expected, the mirror is filled with a
slowly swirling mix of random colors.
51374: In fact, the more you look, the more the patterns the colors make remind
you of one of the screen savers you have on your computer at home.
51599: And sitting in the back, chin in hand, peacefully dozing behind a
computer, is you!
51669: The pages of the dusty book appear to glow.
51943: Both images have the word 'Rexal' written close by however.
51988: All the pages are blank.
52095: AAACCCHHHOOOO!!  You sneeze from all the dust you've disturbed with your
passage.
52164: All the dust in the air is causing your eyes to water, and your nose to
run.
52230: You pick up some of the books in an attempt to tidy up, but with no
place to put them you soon give up the task as futile.
52331: You attempt to clear some of the debris away, but soon give it up as a
lost cause.
52611: It is a mere blank page.
53318: The sickening crunch whan you hit the bottom implies that the fall,
though slow to you, was more than fast enough to kill you.
53632: All that remains of the body is a small pile of ash, even now blowing
away in the slight breeze.
53737: The body crumbles into dust with a gentle sigh, leaving an amulet
visible amidst the ash.
53800: Don't you feel that this person has suffered enough?!
53870: You gently lift the amulet off of the body, which crumbles down into
dust with a gentle sigh as you take it.
54117: One of the pages, until now unnoticed, begins to glow.
54243: ,








End of term is just two days away and you still haven't
finished that story you have due for your english professor.  Since it's worth
half of your grade you figure now would be a good time.  Unfortunately for you,
your computer decided that it needed to self-destruct.  So here you are in the
Engineering building computer lab, a place you usually only see during your
computer science labs, along with a half dozen other desperate souls, striving
to cram a month's worth of work into a single night.  Rather familiar territory
now that you think about it.  As is the light doze you just jerked yourself out
of.  Time to get some coffee...
54958: You can't pour that.
55032: A Night at the Lab
Copyright (c) 1996 by Jeremy Farnham.
55104: You can't go that way.
55180: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
55212: As good-looking as ever.
55410: You can escape to the northeast.
55490: The fruits of your labor are currently displayed on the screen.
55660: Perhaps a walk will help you think.
55728: Carrying books, food, clothes, and miscellanea whenever asked and
without complaint.
56408: The opening looks just big enough to allow you passage.
56660: Unfortunately he's as frozen as everyone else you've seen.
56798: It looks fairly immovable.
56952: In addition a door leads north into the parking lot.
57080: Stairs lead up to the third, and down to the first.
57178: You can go south to the third floor, or down to the second.
57490: In addition a door leads south onto the campus.
57612: Stairs lead up to the third, and down to the first.
57710: You can go north to the third floor, or down to the second.
58088: You get the feeling some of this stuff hasn't been touched in years.
58262: The half open door lies in the southwest corner of the room.
58754: Maybe that's where he was heading when... whatever happened, happened.
58994: This hallway looks virtually identical to the ones above you, though
light is visible under the door to the northwest.
59076: The door has the words 'Experimental Laboratory' stenciled on it.
59316: The shifting glow reveals several people frozen in poses of jubilation,
one hovering several inches above the floor, frozen in mid leap.
59712: You can only hope that this is not indeed the case.
59786: You would guess that their test was successful.
59820: A diagram of some sort is attached to the wall.
59948: Must have been a last minute design change.
60212: A female figure, made entirely of dust, stands here gazing at you.
60260: The lights swirl, dive, and soar throughout the room, making you feel
like a giant moving through a galaxy of hyperactive stars.
60380: The label on the bottle reads 'Rexal'.
60412: The labels, though neatly written in a very angular script, are in a
language you neither know nor can identify.
61040: To your surprise, the only visible exit from the room is to the east,
which may explain why the downstairs is so untouched.
61184: And any attempted cleaning appears just as futile.
61248: The shelves inside shattered and broken.
61358: The feather mattress is easily large enough for two people to sleep
comfortably, and the depressed area in the middle of the bed suggests it was
used for quite some time.
61804: The kitchen is to the west and the passage extends north to another
room.
62188: The only path from the descecration lies to the south.
62790: A table and desk, once polished to a rich mahogany, now useful for
naught more than kindling.
62856: The sheer sides of the chasm are well beyond your meager climbing
skills, and the remains of what look to be several people testify to the
effectiveness of jumping across.
62972: The grass is in desperate need of a lawnmower, but it is extremely
unlikely anyone will be by anytime soon to do something about it.
