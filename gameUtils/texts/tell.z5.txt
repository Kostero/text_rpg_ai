55872: This cheap, imported arrow, like "Gosford Park," is long, dull and
British-made.
55936: You'd better not, as someone could get hurt. It's not sharp, but who
knows who might somehow end up choking on it.
56082: This is Street St. which is the main and only street in Swisserland
City. They only have one street so things don't get confusing. To the north is
the center of Swisserland City, which is in the middle of the city. To the
south are the north gates. There are merchants here selling lots of things and
shouting a lot and waving their arms and jumping up and down, and a lot of
people, and a jeep. Life in the big city sure is confusing!!!!!!
56398: You say to your SON, "Hello, SON, stay close to me so you do not die."
He stares at you blankly in response.
56488: You cannot go in that direction because that direction is HAUNTED.
56540: It's a surprising jeep.
56558: The street is packed with people here, as well, and the people come in a
variety of wild shapes and colors. Right here is a man flying around with a jet
pack. Over in this end is a curious fellow with a baseball for a head. Just to
your right you recognize the familiar face of Vermont the grape vendor,
standing in front of her box upon which a myriad of grapes of many different
sizes and colors is laid.

The street goes north, towards the town square, and
south. To the east is the alley of instant death.
56916: It's a cardboard box filled to the brim with grapes.
56956: They're mostly crushed and moldy.
56980: With the help of his jet pack, he is moving faster than a speeding
bicycle, and at the same speed as a speeding man with a jet pack.
57072: He's lying on the ground, not moving.
57100: This gate is called the north gate even though it is to the south due to
a horrible construction accident. Nobody ever mentions that fateful day...
57204: The merry merchants are selling many things, such as potatoes, monkeys,
octopus, cabbage, paperclips, and tomatoes.
57288: "HELLO," say the merchants in unison, "WE ARE MERCHANTS!!"
57348: The people are a happy people who listen with attention and a joy. Also,
they are playing a banjo.
57420: This your BOW, which is yours, you are carrying it. You use it to shoot
ARROWS.
57484: You cannot drop the BOW because it is made out of wood and would
probably be eaten by termites.
57552: You can't give away the BOW because it has your name written on it.
57604: This is your leather QUIVER!!!!! You can tell it is yours because it has
your name written on it.
57804: Vermont is the name of Vermont, who is a happy funny grapemerchant
shaped like a beachball!! Yay!!!!!!
57880: Vermont the grape merchant is here, trying to sell her quota of five
grapes before she leaves.
57946: Vermont hands you a plump purple grape and says "Please take this plump
purple grape!"
58012: "Oh you are kissing me IgrerrergeergC!"
58124: "Hip hop hooray and goodbye for now."
58152: This is the alley of instant death. It looks just like a normal alley.
58204: It looks exactly like you'd expect it to look like.
58240: Now the street has ended and you are on the south side of the square. To
your north is the more norther part of the square, and beyond even that you can
see the northernmost part of the square, to the south of which is the
aforementioned not as north as the north part of the square part of the square.
The latter part of the square (the part of the square that is to the north of
the south part of the square but is not as far north as the north part of the
square) is to the north of you, and you can see the evil PRESIDENT'S box on a
stick to your north, in that part of the square (the middle part between the
north part, to the north of the middle part between the south and north parts,
and the south part, where you are.) The south street heading south is to the
south.

There are stormtroopers here, stormtrooping. Every now and then you
notice one of them trumpet recklessly.
58856: You are too south of it to see any detail. Try getting more north
relative to the pole. It is to your north.
58932: You are too north of it to see any detail. Try getting more south
relative to the pole. It is to your south.
59008: It looks just like something which you can't see because you're not
close enough to it.
59072: The stormtroopers stormtroop wildly and with abandon. They have
harnessed the power of hypnosis- you've seen them completely hypnotize a living
cow in under six seconds.
59192: You'd better not, you might end up with the shit hypnotized out of you.
59242: This part of the square is in between the southern part of the square to
your south, and the northern part of the square which you can see to your
north. To the northern part of the square's south is you. Beyond the northern
part of the square is the place where you want to go to, which is even farther
north than the northern part of the square, even though the north part of the
square which is the part of the square which is to your north is the part of
the square that is the most north. That's because the place where you want to
go is more north than the square itself, which is merely south in comparison to
the location of the place where you want to go, which is really far to your
north.

To your north, but to the south of the northern part of the square, is
the pole with the PRESIDENT'S box on it. The stormtroopers stormtroop around
the pole, bedecked in fanciful Jews and accolades, making sure that all who
pass treat the PRESIDENT with the proper respect. 

To your south is the
southern part of the square, while the northern part of the square lies
northerly to your northern north.
60016: You watch horrified as the stormtroopers stormtroop around a helpless
old man, hypothesizing violently, and begin to brutally hypnotize him. You hide
your SON's eyes as the poor man is hypnotized so badly that he collapses to the
ground. Three stormtroopers grab him by each arm and drag him offscreen,
chewing loudly.
60240: A stormtrooper grunts dully and fucks a tree, motioning you to pass.
60290: The stormtrooper grunts dully and fucks a tree, motioning you to pass.
60344: A stormtrooper yelps and fucks himself sideways, barring your progress
until you salute the box. He dances frenetically, as if to tell you not to try
that again.
60456: The stormtrooper shouts, belches, and stabs a baby in the head with his
sword for no reason, refusing to let you pass until you salute the fucking box.
He dies messily, as if to tell you that you really shouldn't try that again.
60614: The stormtrooper barks roughly, draws a picture of a mountain goat and
runs towards you, eating several buildings as he approaches. He levitates
briefly and then punches you in the head six and a half times. When you wake
up, you are in a marketplace next to the square.
60804: This pole is shaped like a long, cylindrical pole. It's made out of
wooden wood. It stands a million feet tall, and on top of the one millionth
foot is the PRESIDENT'S box. The box is shaped like a square, but three
dimensional. It's roughly the size of a rusty, white-painted motor home with
frilly curtains on the windows, and accommodates the PRESIDENT nicely. You can
see the PRESIDENT'S cute little nose poking out from between the Venetian
blinds, vibrating slightly when a breeze hits it.
61170: You salute the box salutarily. 

"WHY HELLO, NOBLE WOODEN CITIZEN!" You
hear a recording of the PRESIDENT'S voice issuing from a speaker at the base of
the pole. "I AM THE PRESIDENT!!!! THANK YOU FOR SALUTING MY BOX!!!! PLEASE
CONTINUE ON YOUR WAY AND ENJOY THE NOBLE CITY OF SWISSERLAND CITY!!!!" 

There
is a dull thud, a crackle, and the tape stops.
61520: You push the pole and it slowly begins to topple. Because it's a million
miles tall, it takes several minutes to finish falling. Before you can see it
horizontal, a group of stormtroopers run up to you, shouting and shitting
bricks, and seize you by the arms, legs and larynx. You are taken to jail where
you are executed by a killer whale.
61756: You continue on your way. Suddenly, you are attacked by a killer whale.
61954: Usually, the old man is a popular make-out spot. Today, though, no young
farm boy and his cousin lie in the old man's shade. Instead, WILLIAM TELL
JUNIOR, who is your SON, has been glued to the old man. About four or five
yards away, give or take a couple of miles, you are restrained by
stormtroopers.
62184: No! If you left now, your son would be stranded, and even worse, you
wouldn't get the maximum score!
62256: The old man's head is tilted straight up, and he stares, unblinkingly,
right at the sun. Occasionally a drop of pus oozes out of his left eye and
rolls down and off his cheek, falling into a small puddle collecting at his
feet.
62554: . SMARTHEAD! YOUR ADVENTURE ENDS HERE."
62604: He is a merry, rotund little man with apple cheeks and a bulbous, fuzzy
nose. He radiates pure evil.
62676: The PRESIDENT is watching the proceedings merrily, bopping occasionally.
62750: . WILLIAM TELL!!!!!! I AM THE PRESIDENT!!!!! LET ME TELL YOU I AM VERY
DISAPPOINTED IN YOU. IT WAS VERY UNCALLED-FOR FOR YOU TO NOT SALUTE THE BOX.
YOU HAVE HURT MY FEELINGS VERY MUCH. HOWEVER SINCE I AM A JUGULAR MAN I WILL
LET YOU GO... JUST AS SOON AS YOU COMPLETE MY LITTLE TEST OF YOUR ARCHERY
SKILLS!"

You see him take something from one of the stormtroopers, and place
it on your SON'S head. It is the grape that was given to you by Vermont, the
shopkeeper, earlier in the game!

"I KNOW FROM THE HORRIFIED LOOK IN YOUR
EYES," he continues, "THAT YOU HAVE GUESSED MY BERRY PLAN! I WON'T KEEP YOU ANY
LONGER... TEST YOUR SKILLS! BEFORE ME, SIRRAH! BEFORE ME AS ALWAYS! HA, HA HA,
HAAAA...." nobly cackled.
63512: You cannot speak to him, as your mouth fell off in the struggle.
63560: You shoot him in the ass. He dies instantly, as you do when you are
hypnotized into a stupor by a stormtroop of burping stormtroopers and then
festively beaten to death.
63676: His back is glued to the old man, and he gazes slack-jawed at you,
drooling, apparently unaware of what is going on around him.
63768: Your SON doesn't seem to know what's going on around him, or indeed who
you even are. He lost most of his memories in the accident.
63864: He moans softly and tries to eat it. His teeth, soft and useless from
years of poor hygiene, simply bend around it.
63948: You can't: you've lost your personal talking bee.
63984: You look him in the eyes and tell him, "My bazaar trash observer has
entered phase full melee." It doesn't matter, he can't understand anything you
say to him.
64098: You aim carefully, and your arrow flies high. Your breath tightens as it
appears for a moment to be headed straight towards your beloved grape. You emit
a sigh of relief as it narrowly misses, hitting your SON'S head a few inches
below.

The crowd that has gathered erupts with joy. A sour look strikes the
PRESIDENT'S face. 

"VERY WELL," he pissed-offedly roars above the crowd, "YOU
SHALL GO FREE... THIS TIME!" He motions to a stormtrooper, who removes your
beautiful, beaming grape from your dead SON'S head and places it in your open
arms.

The crowd that has gathered erupts with a collective "AWW!"
64568: You'd like to, but for a variety of reasons, can't.
64608: Why bother? No matter what you do, he'll have forgotten about it within
a couple of minutes.
64676: At this distance, you can barely make out its beautiful features.
64724: The grape looks delicious, as purple and plump as a ripe goiter.
64772: No, you'll obviously need it later in the game.
64808: Vermont intended it for your SON. She didn't know, of course, that he
can't eat solid foods, but it's the thought that counts.
64902: The arrow strikes the grape in its center. You gasp in horror as the
grape is splattered across the trunk of the old man. The PRESIDENT laughs
evily.

"HA, HA, HA," he cackles, "YOUR AIM WAS NOT AS GREAT AS I HAVE BEEN
TOLD, AFTER ALL. YOU COULDN'T EVEN HIT YOUR SON FROM FOUR YARDS!"

You double
up with a bagful of agony and pain, unable to accept the horror of what you
have just done. You have murdered your beloved grape!
65272: You have a heart discussion with yourself about the analogical
significance of David Lynch's "Lost Highway."
65352: At the moment, you can't think of anything to say.
65388: You look like William Tell.
65410: Hello!!!! You are William Tell in this: a game about William Tell. In
this game you live in Swisserland, which is where the Switzes live. The Switzes
love to ski and make cheese and clocks and bank accounts. You, William Tell,
are a Swiss in my game about Swisserland. You live in Swisserland City,
Swisserland, which is the capital of Swisserland. The year is 1307 AD and a
really bad man is PRESIDENT of Swisserland. The PRESIDENT lives in a box on top
of a flagpole in the center of Swisserland City which is the capital of
Swisserland and everybody who sees the box has to salute the box and say,
"HELLO! BOX!!!" and act very reverential because that is where the PRESIDENT
lives. This is important because you, William Tell, do not like the PRESIDENT
at all and you are going to refuse to salute the box because if you don't you
won't get the OPTIMAL ENDING and you won't collect all 10,000 POINTS.

You,
William Tell, live in the mountains of Swisserland in a BLUE hut. Today you
come down from the mountains with WILLIAM TELL JUNIOR, your SON, who eats paint
chips. 

It is a regular day in Swisserland City and you are with your SON.
Little do the both of you know what fate has in store for you...!
