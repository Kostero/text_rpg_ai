enough room to park a couple of cars.
57860: The bricks of the driveway are laid in a precise herring-bone pattern.
57912: A dark blue Ford Mondeo is carefully parked on the road, just far enough
away to be inconspicuous and close enough in case you need to make a quick
getaway.
58020: It's your getaway car, stolen especially for the job. It'll provide you
with a nice quick exit once you've finished looting the house.
58116: You climb into your getaway car...
58172: No, you can't do it. You can't leave empty handed from such rich
pickings. After all, there's your reputation to think of. Shaking your head you
get back out of the car.
58296: It's a large property. Something that you'd never be able to afford,
well not without a really big score. It's a two story house complete with
double glazing, artificial pillars and an enviable location.
58440: This vast hall is obviously intended to impress visitors. A large
grandfather clock stands on one side with an impressive flight of stairs on the
other.
58544: A long dirty coat is hanging on a hook by the front door.
58584: Rooms lead off to the east and the south. The front door is to the
north.
58916: It's a very old grandfather clock. The sound of it ticking away to
itself reminds you that time is of the essence.

lucky for you, you're not most thieves.
59076: Leaving the house without putting the loot in your swag bag would not be
a good idea!
59136: It's a hook on the wall for hanging clothing on.
59172: The coat, although now dusty, dirty and worthless, wasn't cheap when it
was purchased some time ago.
59244: You find a key and a torch in the pockets.
59276: It's a compact, white answering machine. It's got a single large button
on it.
59336: There's a little green light winking at you.
59368: The button is small, white and has "play" written on it.
59412: It's attached to the answering machine. If you had a screwdriver handy
and perhaps a spare ten minutes then maybe you could remove it.
59508: A plastic voice announces "There are no, new messages"
59548: A plastic voice announces "There is 1 new message."

"Jefferson, It's
Margaret. I'll be back this evening around about 7, so I'll see you when you

The machine clicks
and whirrs as it rewinds the tape.
59744: The key is made of brass and looks like a door key.
59780: It's a good quality battery powered torch.
59812: You need to be holding the torch to do that.

and a bathroom to the south. A flight of stairs lead down to the hall where you
can see
59956: The deep pile carpet feels springy under your feet. There's a luxurious
three piece suite positioned around a large coffee table in front of a large
fireplace.
60068: The patio can be seen out of the open patio doors to the east.
60112: The patio doors in the east wall gives the lounge a bright airy feel.
60160: The table is square with legs carved in the shape of claws.
60204: The suit consists of a sofa and two armchairs.
60236: You sit down on the suite. It's really comfortable
60272: You've found a silver cigarette case down the back of the cushions.
60320: The fireplace, with its marble surround is certainly impressive although
it doesn't appear to have been used for some time.
60420: The lever is in the down position and could be pushed up.
60460: The lever is in the up position and could be pulled down.

60700: There is now a large empty space on the wall where the painting used to
be.

garden is to the east.

60876: You roll up your sleeves and feel about in the water, but fail to find
anything of interest.
60940: A water-feature is almost obligatory in any well to do estate. This one
is particuly well kept.
61008: You give the gnome a mighty whack with the hammer and the gnome
disintegrates in a cloud of plaster dust! Something falls to the floor.
61104: No matter what you try, you only manage to achieve a few scratches and
chips in the plaster.
61168: It's a hideous gnome made of plaster.
61196: The large dog is snoring loudly and dribbling on the patio.
61240: Luckily this large brute of a dog is tied up, but it still stand between
you and the rest of the garden.

it falls into a pile on the paving stones and starts to snore.

61812: You get on your hands and knees and search the flowerbeds but come up
empty handed.
61872: The lawn is exceptionally well kept. You'd like to know how they keep it
moss free and get the light and dark striped in the grass but perhaps now is
not the time to be thinking of that.
62000: You get on your hands and knees and search the lawn but come up empty
handed.
62056: The statue is incredibly carved and obviously very very old.
62100: You're in a small windowless shed. It's full of assorted garden junk,
which judging by the cobwebs isn't used much at all.
62188: You rummage around the junk in the shed, but fail to find anything of
use or value.
62248: It's a plain old hammer with a metal head on a wooden shaft.
62292: The crowbar is about two feet long with flat curved ends.
62364: This wooden panelled room must have seen some dinner parties in the
past. The table runs along the centre of the room. An archway to the east gives
access to the kitchen. The hall to the north is the only other exit.
62516: Hanging directly above the table is an impressive crystal chandelier.
62564: It's a beautiful work of art, incorporating gem stones in its design.
Judging by the fixings in the ceiling it probably weighs quite a lot too.
62696: After a couple of good strong blows with the hammer the chandelier comes
crashing down, the crystal and gemstones showering your helmet like a
hailstorm.
62800: The chandelier creaks and groans before suddenly crashing down on top of
your head. Your world fades to black...
62880: Everything you try, fails to dislodge any of the gemstones.
62924: The sturdy table is a deep, highly polished mahogany, large enough to
seat at least a dozen people.
62996: It's a very nice crystal fruit bowl. Worth quite a bit to the right
antique dealer.
63056: Even you wouldn't destroy something worth a bob or two.
63096: It's a nice, fresh, ripe apple.
63120: The gems are of all shapes and sizes from the remains of the chandelier.
63204: You're in the study with a bookshelf taking up much of the north wall.

is, under the window and within easy reach of the bookshelf. The landing is to

topics although books about ancient Egypt seem to pop-up again and again.

63508: You look through the books on the bookshelf, but fail to find any that
interest you.
63568: The desk is made of mahogany and is in itself a wonderful antique. You'd
never get it down the stairs on your own though.
63652: It's an exquisitely crafted gold fountain pen.
63692: It would take far too long to sort these papers out!
63728: There is nothing else of interest amongst the papers.
63768: One letter in particular catches your eye, an insurance document.
63886: Smith regarding a ring that was lost in the garden some months ago.
63932: The bathroom has all the facilities you'd expect including a toilet, a
sink and a bath, except this one has marble and chrome everywhere proving yet
again that taste and wealth are mutually exclusive. The landing is to the
north.
64092: The sink, like everything else in this room is constructed of chrome and
marble.
64148: The bath is vast and deep.
64168: The toilet is more of a throne of marble than a toilet. Above the toilet
is a matching cistern.
64236: There's a strange rattling sound from the cistern as water swirls around
the toilet bowl.
64300: Water swirls around the bowl of the toilet.
64332: That's not appropriate right now!
64356: The remote control is made of black plastic and has a solitary button on
it.
64408: Hanging on the wall above the sink is a small bathroom cabinet.
64452: It's exactly where you'd expect medicines and personal hygiene products
to be stored.
64512: The label on the bottle reads:

  "Fast Acting Sleeping Pills 
  To be
taken only when in bed. 
  (May cause drowsiness)"
64604: You press the small pills deep into the raw meat.
64660: You place the lid back on the cistern.
64688: It's small and innocent looking rubber button.

secret compartment.
64788: The secret compartment slowly closes until there is no trace it was
there.
64840: You're in the bedroom dominated by an impressive four poster bed. You
can't think of a nice way to describe the fussy floral wallpaper that smothers
the walls. The landing lies to the east.
64972: The small black cat is eyeing you with suspicion.
65008: Despite your best efforts the cat manages to evade you.
65048: "Do I look like someone who can talk?" replies the cat.
65092: It doesn't look like a very friendly kind of cat!
65152: A small black cat wanders into the room.
65184: It's a large carved four poster bed complete with canopy. Probably worth
a bit, but there's no way you could carry that!
65272: There's a magazine and a gold cufflink under there.
65308: Staring at the wallpaper just gives you a blinding headache.
65352: An old safe stands in the corner of the room close to the window.
65400: The safe is an old fashioned free standing safe with a large cumbersome
lock.
65456: With a bit of force you manage to prise the door open.
65496: Sitting inside the safe is a large diamond.
65528: There's really no point, the safe isn't locked.
65564: The diamond is impressively large, about the size of a golf ball.
65612: It's a single gold cufflink inlaid with a blue pattern.
65652: The pattern on the cufflink looks like an Egyptian scarab beetle.
65700: It's a magazine entitled "Amateur Archeology". It's got a picture of an
impressive gold Egyptian death mask on the cover and boasts a super Egyptian
artifacts supplement. The magazine has obviously been well thumbed.
65856: This large kitchen looks like something out of a brochure. It's marble
work surfaces and shiny chrome appliances have probably been cleaned more often
than they've been used. There's a fridge is whirring away to itself in the
corner. The dining room is through an arch to the west. A flight of stairs lead
down to a cellar below.
66084: It's a device for keeping things cool!
66148: The butter is rather old.
66168: Despite your better judgement you force yourself to eat the butter,
wondering what it must be doing to your cholestorol level.
66256: You're in dark, dusty cellar. The Kitchen it at the top of a flight of
stairs. There are cardboard boxes strewn everywhere.
66344: You rummage in the boxes but find nothing of interest or value.
66388: The key is quite large and chunky, and would fit a sizeable old lock.
66436: The crash helmet is designed to protect your head against injuries from
falling objects.

attached.

into the darkness.
66820: Two dark archways lead off to the east and the west from this end of the
passage which leads back to the north.
66896: The roof of this chamber is only barely higher than the passage way to
the east. The room appears featureless, apart from the cobwebs which festoon
the brickwork.
67008: The bricks are old and covered in cobwebs and the mortar around a
section of the west wall appears to have crumbled away.
67092: No matter how you try to attack the wall it doesn't seem to make any
difference.
67148: The compartment is approximately one foot square.
67184: An Egyptian sceptre encrusted in jewels.

death mask.
67368: The mask lies in the sarcophagus.

67424: It's a stone sarcophagus covered in Egyptian hieroglyphics.
67468: Using the crowbar you manage to force the lid off the sarcophagus. It
falls to the floor blowing up a cloud of dust. As the dust clears you can see
mummified figure wearing an incredibly beautiful golden death mask.
67616: No matter what you try, the heavy stone lid refuses to move.
67660: An exceptionally valuable Egyptian death mask.
67696: It's just the preserved remains of an ancient Egyptian king.
67740: The lid has fallen off the sarcophagus and cracked almost in half.
67788: It's a beautiful golden ring.
67812: Large brown sack with the word "swag" written on it in large black
letters.
67868: They are well worn black leather gloves that have always served you well
in the past.
67928: You wouldn't want to be leaving fingerprints now would you?
67972: An angry looking woman.
67990: A large angry looking woman stands before you, but before you can react
she pulls out a taser gun and blasts thousands of volts through you. Your
unconscious body falls to the floor...
68122: You hear a car pulling up outside the house.
68200: You hear the sound of a car door closing from the direction of the
driveway.
68274: pens and a large angry looking woman jumps out. You can see the veins on
her forehead pulsing as she pulls out a taser gun and blasts thousands of volts
through you. Your unconscious body falls to the floor...
68420: A large angry looking woman steps into the hall. You can see the veins
on her forehead pulsing as she pulls out a taser gun and blasts thousands of
volts through you. Your unconscious body falls to the floor...
68568: You stop motionless, your heart pounding in your chest as you hear a
woman's voice call out "Hello? Hello? Is there anyone there?"
68688: A large angry looking woman steps into the hall. You can see the veins
on her forehead pulsing as she pulls out a taser gun and blasts thousands of
volts through you. Your unconscious body falls to the floor...
68868: It's big, and expensive.
68888: You are a master thief and you've just broken into one of many
properties owned by Jefferson Smith, the fifteenth wealthiest person in
England. All you have to do is load up your swag bag with valuables and get to
your getaway car. Should be simple...

As planned, the cleaning lady accepted a
small bribe and left the front door ajar. Without any difficulty you've been
able to slip into the hallway unnoticed...
69184: The aim of the game is to strip the house of all its valuables, putting
them in your swag bag and then make your getaway.
69268: HINT: Remember it often pays dividends to search everywhere!
69316: HINT: If only you could get this damn dog to sleep.
