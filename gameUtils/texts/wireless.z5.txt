109052: .  "I'll have to remember that."
109086: "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that,"
109948: Feelies! You remember these! They were little objects that games
manufacturers included in the packaging. They sort of bridged the distance
between the reality of the player and the reality of the game. Sometimes they'd
be useful items, like maps of certain areas of the game; other times, they'd be
little more than fun items like these.
110208: An official looking piece of paper ordering the destruction of
property.
110260: It would be bad manners to start rearranging the furniture. You leave
110312: "Work damn you!"
110336: This is the reception area. There is a sign here, and a podium
110380: . The centre of the reception is dominated by a large and out of place
leather-lined desk
110444: . There is also a small waiting area with four low chairs and a coffee
table.
The door to the main office lies to the west.
110532: The sign reads "Gone to lunch" in hastily scrawled marker pen.
110580: The receptionist seems to have switched it for a less classy number.
110628: The tiny little door is closed. There is a miniscule sign hanging from
the handle which you can just make out (in Century Schoolbook point 6) the
phrase "Do not disturb".
110808: You see the reception area lying beyond the office door.
110848: You can make out the silhouette of Our Humble Editor in the office
beyond.
110904: Difficult, that, looking through closed doors...
110944: You are in the office. If this is a place of industry and toil there is
little sign of it now.
111118: a comfortable looking chair, in which sits Our Humble Editor. Hanging
on the wall is a painting you don't recall seeing when last you visited. The
way back to the reception area lies east.
111256: the editor is speaking into his dictaphone. He beckons you in. 

"
111774: " He stops the dictaphone and places it in his jacket pocket.

"You're
early? Good!
111972: the editor tsk-tsks at you. He taps at his pocketwatch.

"Late, boy!
Late! This simply won't do! Still, let us waste no more time,
112072: I have a task for you; a job. Tell me what you know about text
adventures."
112128: Everything seems grey in the deadzone. You feel you oughtn't be here.
112232: Your view of the farside of the plinth is obscured by the legs of the
receptionist.
112292: You chance a glance behind the podium and happen to see the smallest,
tiniest door you've ever encountered.
112368: Set in the back of the plinth is the tiniest door you've ever seen!
112416: Through the door you can see a tiny little man, curled up on a pile of
leaves. You can hear him gently snoring.
112496: Through the door you can see a tiny little man, curled up on a pile of
leaves. You can hear him gently snoring.
112576: Difficult, that, looking through closed doors...
112612: He must be all of six inches tall, and fast asleep.
112648: "Hello there?" you say, and "Sorry to trouble you..."
112692: "Hey! Wake up!" you shout
112756: The smallest sign imaginable.
112780: "Do not disturb" says the sign.
112804: A brass frame on a stick. The lettering is ornate, and if you haven't
missed your mark is of the typeface Felix Titling.
112892: It says 'Please ring for assistance'.
112920: The kind of bell you get in reception areas... hey, wait a second!
112968: I shouldn't interfere with the equipment if I were you. These
receptionists can be frightfully vindictive when riled.
113050: The bell rings out for nearly a minute before a man in a dark red suit
pops up from behind the podium and silences it with a single, outstretched
finger. You wonder if he has been back there all the time.
"Good day, sir. May
I help you at all?" He asks.
113236: The receptionist frowns at you. "Yes?"
113268: You ring the bell again. The receptionist says "I believe the bell has
served its function, sir. If I can be of any assistance, you only have to ask."
113376: "Please, this is getting a little tiresome," the receptionist says.
113428: The receptionist sighs, silences the bell, and moves it beneath the
plinth, muttering to himself about the state of journalism in this day and age.
113560: A low but comfortable looking padded black leather seat.
113600: Slightly too large for the office, the mahogany and green leather desk
dominates the room. The old buzzard has had this desk forever, and it shows its
scars proudly. Its history is written out in spilt ink, cigar burns and coffee
stains.
113764: Here and there are the dark recesses of forgotten cigars and the deep
gouges that bear witness to the strange and unusual punishment the editor has
put to his furniture over the years.
113996: The ink stains are many and varied. Here there is India, there
Whistler's Mother, and scattered amongst them like the cadavers of dead
instincts lie strange symbols, no doubt the product of the editor's scribbling.
114220: It's a watercolour of a building complex lined with trees and greenery.
114270: You reach out and try to push your way into the painting, but the
editor stops you.
"Steady on old chap! I've got to give it back to the Colonel,
Friday! I'll look quite the cove returning it covered in your paw prints."

"I
thought I could enter it," you explain.

"No, no. The mimesis won't allow that
sort of behaviour!"
114512: You reach out for the painting but- "Steady on old chap! I've got to
give it back to the Colonel, Friday!"
 You leave the painting alone.
114614: The editor watched you examine the painting. "Pleasant view, no? That's
MIT, the birthplace of Infocom. I'm breaking it in for a friend."
114724: It's a watercolour of MIT, apparently.
114754: The editor says "The Zork adventures were born in one of those
buildings back in 1979."
114854: I software SHRDLU was developed," the editor says. "That was one of two
chief programs that were text based, had a natural language interface and
preceded Advent. Not exactly an adventure, though, stacking geometric solids!"
115020: The painting seems almost to move, to sway invitingly. You feel you
could amost reach out and enter it.
115092: "Don't care much for watercolours, m'self," says the ed. "Give me oils
any day; oils or a bit of marble.
115172: Gummo is lord of the deadzone.
115200: You made an attempt to smarten yourself up a bit for your meeting but
have not successfully masked your dishevelled heart.
115284: "Time presses on, m'boy," says the editor. He retrieves from his pocket
a sheet of paper which he hands to you.

"I found these useful," he says.
115392: "Well, m'boy," sayeth the editor as he fishes about for his
pocketwatch, "time seems to have beaten us. Still, there's more than enough for
you to be getting on with!"

He gets up and walks you to the door.

"A couple
of thousand words ought to do the trick, I think. Usual deadline. Now..."

As
you step out of the office, the chief surveys the reception where
115852: "Come" he beckons, and the two enter the office, closing the door
behind them.

Now to get home and scribbling. You'll probably get the thing
finished before the pubs shut.
115980: You check the time and realise there's no chance of seeing the editor
now. As you step back into the street you bump into
116256: .

"Good luck!" you say as you pass by, annoyed at yourself for having
wasted so much time. Still, it's a while before the pubs shut...
116356: Smartly turned out, the receptionist appears almost god-like behind his
podium. He looks at you expectantly.
116432: The receptionist coughs delicately into his gloved hand.
116472: The receptionist brushes dust from the shoulders of his jacket.
116516: The receptionist runs a finger along the surface of the podium, stares
at his finger and tuts.
116584: The receptionist takes a handkerchief from his pocket and gives the
desk bell a quick buffing.
116648: The receptionist takes a handkerchief from his pocket and gives the
plinth a quick going over.
116712: "Has sir arranged to have this monstrosity removed yet?" Asks the
receptionist, indicating towards the desk. "And has sir also considered that,
as I tend to go to lunch once you have entered the office, I will only say
these lines if the player has somehow cheated?"
116900: The receptionist makes 'bob bob bob' noises, clearly deep in thought.
116952: The receptionist imperceptibly raises an eyebrow.
116988: The receptionist straightens the sign.
117016: The receptionist fixes his tie knot.
117044: The receptionist moves the desk bell a few millimetres, stares at it
and, after a few seconds, nods.
117116: The receptionist drums his fingers 'pon the plinth.
117152: "I don't think this is the right time for such questions," says the
editor.
117208: All capilaries and tweed, Our Humble Editor masks himself behind a grey
and ginger moustache. He has a twinkle in his eye that a long history of Port
abuse has done little to diminish.
117340: The editor drums his fingers on his desk.
117372: The editor picks up the copy of God's Rude Wireless and flicks through
the pages, smiling and tutting as he goes. After a short moment he pops it back
on the desk.
117520: The editor plucks up the cardboard glasses, pops them on, and then
starts patting the desk with open hands. "Hello?" he says, and, "who's there?"
before taking them off with a chuckle and putting them down.
117668: The editor pats his pockets for a moment.
117700: The editor picks the box up from the desk reads a little of the text,
and then drops it back down.
117768: A well worn piece of paper littered with the editor's scribble.
118068: A tiny and inviting capsule.
118088: It's a sheet of old fashioned computer paper - the type with lines on.
118140: ,
with name 'desk' 'bureau',
description "Slightly too large for the
office, the mahogany and green leather desk dominates the room. The old buzzard
has had this desk forever, and it shows its scars proudly. Its history is

has supporter;
118356: The editor glances through it and pauses for a moment. "Old Buzzard,
eh?" he says with a well placed harumph.
118436: On the cover is a striking image from the early twentieth century, an
old couple posing in front of their terraced house.
118520: Despite its small size, it seems to have a remarkable number of in
depth articles that both inform and entertain.
118756: M. Night Shyamalan
119368: M. Night Shyamalan
119564: Ursula K. Le Guin
120416: Daniel Bristow.
120428: Paul Morris.
120440: Rob Morris.
120452: T.J. Worthington.
120468: Alison Bean.
120480: Jonathan Sloman.
120496: Simon Scott.
120508: Our Humble Editor.
120524: Tat Wood.
120532: Justin Lewis.
120544: Our Humble Editor.
120560: Julian Goford.
120572: You open the magazine at a randomly selected page.
120608: But the magazine is already open.
120632: But the magazine is already closed.
120660: You left your scissors at home, I'm afraid.
120692: An A4 missive from the editor.
120752: 0, eh, there's a good chap." short and to the point as ever. It was
signed at the bottom in a fluorishing scribble.
120836: "Ah yes, that will do nicely." The receptionist sniffs. He
120880: "Ah, you must be Our Humble Editor's two thirty." The receptionist
120988: "If you'd like to go through." The receptionist gestures towards the
office door.
121048: "It's a very nice memo, sir," the receptionist says, wearily.
121096: He looks over the memo. "Yes... yes..." he says, and then "What am I
supposed to be noticing, exactly?"
121180: A cardboard box about six inches by four inches. It is emblazoned with
the text "The Hitchhikers' Guide To The Galaxy" and a spacescape featuring a
curious round green fellow waving his arms about.
121320: "Beyond question the most mind-bogglingly hilarious story Infocom has
ever produced is THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY, written and designed by
Douglas Adams, author of the phenomenally best-selling novel, and Steve
Meretzky, the award-winning designer of Infocom's PLANETFALL and SORCERER.

"As
the story begins, you are Arthur Dent, and a bulldozer is preparing to level
your house even as an alien space fleet is preparing to level your planet. The
incorrigible Mr. Adams has written new material and designed problems
especially for this interactive story. So grab a pint of bitter and a couple
for the road and join Ford Prefect, Trillian, Zaphod Beeblebrox and Marvin on a
cosmic jaunt into the outer reaches where anything can -- and does -- happen.
And don't forget your towel!"
121988: Lint? Looks more like cotton wool to me!
122020: A small polythene pouch that claims to contain a spacefleet smaller
than the naked eye can see.
122088: The pin-badge is orange with yellow writing that reads "Don't Panic!"
in large, friendly letters.
122160: "Order For Destruction
Be it known that on this day the 4th day of
October in the Year of Our Lord 1982 that by decree of the Domicile Demolition
Department of Cottingshire County, the residence of Arthur Dent at 155 Country
Lane in the town of Cottington shall herewith be demolished, destroyed and
otherwise transformed into a nondescript heap of pulverised rubble; said
resident(s) having evacuated said premises within 750 days of the issuance of
this document; this order to be carried out regardless of acknowledgement by
said resident(s) of proper notification; said demolition being necessitated by
reason of: 
It's in the way.
 Said property has been seized by Right of Eminent
Domain for future use as: 
Highway right-of-way."

It is signed at the bottom
by Douglas Adams, Marc Blank, and Steve Meretzky.
122760: You can't read it as it seems to have been written in Vogon. There is a
nice picture of the Earth though.
122854: "I have an appointment at two thirty," you say.
122892: "Ah, yes, he did say someone ought to be along." The receptionist says.
"Needless to say you've brought some form of credentials? A passport or gas
bill should do."
123012: "So you say, sir," sniffs the receptionist.
123048: "Yes, dear boy, yes!" The editor looks about the office. "This is it!
You're here!"
123168: "Why, certainly, sir," replies the receptionist, "providing you can
supply this supposed 'memo,' of course."
123252: .

"I know, sir. You've shown it to me," the Receptionist says. "Now if
you'd like to go through, you're keeping the editor waiting, and you know how
he can be."
123376: .

"Really, sir?" Asks the receptionist. "May I see it, perhaps?"
123432: "Yes yes. I've a little task for you." The editor says. "What do you
know of text adventures?"
123504: You think for a moment, and then begin. "A text adventure is a game
system whereby you interact using natural language with a world simulated
mainly in words. I used to play them when I was younger. I had the Hitchhiker's
Guide To The Galaxy game."
123684: "Ah, Hitchhikers'! Infocom, wasn't it? Any good?" Your editor asks with
a grin.
123748: "Not really," you say. "I didn't really know about Hitchhikers' when I
was playing the game, so the puzzles were a little beyond me. Also the game
ducks out of giving you the characters from the book somewhat. Always falling
asleep or going for a sauna."

"Not a huge fan, then?" The editor asks.
123964: "Pity. I managed to acquire this recently." He pulls something from a
drawer in his desk and plops it down in front of you.
124052: He stares at the empty space where once there was a desk, and then
continues.
124108: "In any case, my mind is made up. You're definitely the man for the
job."
124164: "I have an appointment with the editor," you say.
124200: "Ah, yes, he did say someone ought to be along." The receptionist says.
"Needless to say you've brought some form of credentials? A passport or gas
bill should do."
124320: "Yes, sir," the receptionist says with a frown, "you can go through."
He gestures towards the door.
124396: "What sort of credentials are you willing to accept?" You ask.
124444: "Oh, anything that proves that you are who you claim to be and are not
here under false pretenses. A driver's license would do. Or a passport. Or NUJ
card. Or, for that matter, a bank card, credit card, video rental card, ration
card, national insurance card, birth certificate, death certificate, general
certificate of secondary education. Or a gas bill, electricity bill, storage
facility bill, duck bill, or water bill. Perhaps a pay slip, tax slip, nasty
slip, Freudian slip, bank statement, public statement, Foster Wallace's
'entertainment', employer's reference, a signed letter from a professional
person, a criminal record, or a personal record of achievement. All or any of
these will more than suffice." The receptionist smiles for the first time,
obviously pleased with himself.
125012: "I'm sure I don't know what you mean, sir," the receptionist says
indignantly.
125072: With a light eager voice you ask "Could you tell me about the
aspadistra please?"
125132: The receptionist looks at you for a moment before drawing you near and
whispering "I suspect that was only meant as an example."
125224: "You keep that bell well polished, don't you?" you ask the
receptionist.
125280: "Are you going to put the bell back?" you ask hopefully
125320: "One likes to ensure the reception area is kept to a high standard of
cleanliness, sir." sniffs he.
125392: "I suspect sir has yet to reach a level of maturity such that he will
not be tempted to enforce upon all in earshot his monotonous campanology, sir,"
admonishes the receptionist.
125516: "How is the editor today?" you ask, attempting the sort of cameradery
that sometimes exists between employees.
125596: "My professionalism strictly forbids me to comment on the mood and
attitude of my employer, sir," the receptionist says. So much for that, then!
125700: "Read this month's issue?" you ask.
125728: "Print is dead," sniffs the receptionist.
125760: "Nice... furniture you have here," you say, struggling for topics of
conversation.
125824: "Your interest in interior design is not one mutually held, it pains me
to say." grimaces the receptionist.
125900: "Hello there," you say. 
"What ho!" The editor beams.
125944: "Why the interest in adventure games?" you ask.
125980: "What sort of length were you thinking of?" you ask.
126020: "Why, I think there might be an article in it, of course!" the editor
begins, "And I think you're the chap to pull it off. You used to play these
things, didn't you? And I've done some basic research about the subject and
believe there is certainly meat to be had."
126212: "Oh, a couple of thousand should do it, I think," the editor says.
126264: "Sounds intriguing," you say. "What task?"
126300: "How long would you want it?" You ask.
126332: "I'd like you to work on an article for the magazine on the text
adventure." says the chief. "I've done some basic research about the subject
and believe there is certainly meat to be had."
126468: "Oh, a couple of thousand should do it, I think," the editor says.
126520: Here we go again! "Research?" you ask, innocently.
126560: "Oh, only the basics, you know. The origins of the games, the companies
that made them, that sort of thing."
126640: "I see you've still not rid yourself of that troublesome receptionist,"
you say.
126706: He'll hear!" panics the editor.
126732: "Really, now! Surely I can expect you to find some things out for
yourself!"
126788: "How did the games get started?" you ask "I've often wondered."
126836: "Child of divorce, would you believe?" his humbleness begins. "There
was this chap, um..., Will Crowther. Now, he used to go caving with his wife,
but when the marriage ended, the caving pretty much stopped too. Crowther, who
was a bit of a Dungeons & Dragons nut, created a very accurate textual
simulation of his favourite stomping ground, the Bedquilt caves. And as he was
missing his daughters, he wanted the thing to be easily played and enjoyed by
the sprogs too. So he programmed the thing to take natural language prompts. Of
course, it wasn't until Don Woods got his hands on it that it got nearer to the
text adventures as we came to know them."
127304: "The Bedquilt Caves?" you ask.
127332: "They're a large system of caves in Kentucky, and part of what is
possibly the largest system of caves in the world. They were first mapped in
1842 by a mulatto slave named Stephen Bishop, some fifty years after their
initial discovery. In fact it was Pat Crowther who first rediscovered the tight
passageway that connected Bedquilt to the main system."
127584: "Who was this 'Will Crowther'?"
127680: lab, but in fact an employee of Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Boston. He
devised Advent in his spare time, and it was only by being distributed on the
sapling that would become the internet that Don Woods came to learn of its
existence."
127848: "Natural language?" you ask.
127956: "Don Woods? And what did he do?"
127984: "Jazzed it up a bit, basically. Woods worked at the Stanford Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory. He found a copy of Advent, as Crowther had called it,
on the network there and, after gaining Crowther's blessing, tinkered with it
royally. Woods decked the place out in magic and puzzles. Of course, all this
did was to develop the form somewhat, even then, the hardware wasn't really
able to match the programmers' ambitions. Getting games onto home
microcomputers was to prove the next challenge."
128340: "Tell me more about Advent," you ask
128368: "Why, I'm not sure what more I can tell you," says the editor rubbing
the underside of his chin. "The game was little more than a treasure hunt in a
large cave system. What is perhaps interesting is that once it was unleashed on
the academic networks and copied the thing started changing. Woods wasn't the
first to get his hands on it by any means. In fact I feel it's telling that the
text adventure remained such a finely balanced affair between the experience of
coding and the experience of playing. It seemed that most of the early players
were also interested in creating and Advent all their own."
128788: "Why was it such a problem porting the games onto home computers?" You
ask, turning another page in your mental notebook.
128876: "At the time, the microcomputer market was flooded with all sorts of
different and thoroughly incompatible formats. Added to that was the simple
fact that the computers were much smaller than the mainframe systems on which
Advent had been developed. This didn't stop Scott Adams pulling it off with his
Adventureland in 1978.
129104: "Tell me more of this game you call Adventureland" you say.
129148: "Adams hit upon the idea of using tokens as a means of identifying
which rooms of the 'cave' you were in. A typical description might refer to
slime, moss and granite, say, and you would then know that it wasn't the same
as the room that has slime, moss, and orange rock. It wasn't the most ideal of
systems, but it did manage to get a recognisable text adventure into the home.
129412: Companies?
129420: "Yes... Infocom ruled the school, of course, but there was Magnetic
Scroll, Level 9, Sierra..."
129496: "Magnetic Scroll?" You ask. "That rings a bell, but..."
129638: . Really, Bond, do try to keep up!"

"Bond?" You ask.

"Sorry. Forgot
who I was there for a moment."
129724: "Never played it, I'm afraid. I dare say you could find a copy online
somewhere. World Of Spectrum's a good place to start."
129816: "Level 9?" You ask. "I'm not sure I remember them."
129860: "Really?" Asks the editor. "You surprise me!" He starts to spin himself
slowly around in his chair; a habit of his. "Level 9 was founded in '81 by
Pete, Mike and Nick Austin. They began working on text adventures following
Mike Austin's port of Advent." He starts to raise his voice as he faces the
wall. "They were probably the most important adventure game company in Britain
in their day. Prided themselves on the complexity of their parser; a
complexity," coming back round again, "afforded by the use of very advanced
text compression, letting them free up more memory for the code. Last adventure
game was Scapeghost, released in 1991." He stops his spin with a smile.
130352: "Infocom are probably the most remembered of companies specialising in
adventure games, wouldn't you say?" you ask.
130708: . Along with the help of Tim Anderson and Bruce Daniels they created a
more puzzle-featured version, Zork, which was played a great deal on the MIT
network. The large number of players led to a great deal of feedback that was
then used to further improve the game. This all resulted in a game file of the
then colossal size of 1 megabyte."
The editor stands and walks over to the
window.

"Several of the students at MIT decided to form a company so that they
might work together after graduation, and while looking around for possible
projects, decided that, as so much work had already been done on Zork as it
stood, such a game would be the ideal starting point.

"However it wasn't until
they developed the infamous Z-Machine the the ball really got going." The
editor sits.
131260: "Z-Machine? Tell me more," you implore.
131292: "The notion was to write a special language that would allow the actual
game files to be easily ported from machine to machine. If the language of the
file itself was standardised, you need only create an emulator for the various
microcomputers on the market in order to sell the same game on various
platforms.

"This system was devised by Marc Blank and Joel Berez, and led to
the release of a somewhat paired down version of the original Zork game
entitled Zork I, released in November, 1980."
131644: "Zork was a massive hit; what made it so special?" You ask.
131692: "Well, the ability to reach so many different consumers by way of the
z-machine was a help. So too was their particular brand of humour, one that
went on to run through most of the Infocom games. Why, I shouldn't wonder if
that was the main reason the Hitchhikers' game happened. That was their biggest
seller, of course, and Restaurant At The End Of The Universe was scheduled, but
never appeared. The presence of the predicted revenue in the business plans of
Infocom year after year was only one of the factors in Infocom's eventual
demise, of course. There was Cornerstone on top of that, and then there was the
terror of graphics!"
132144: "Why did graphics become such an issue?"
132176: "Graphics appeared in adventure games before they were really ready to.
Dreadful, blocky, nasty coloured images for the most part, and only useful to
illustrate what was already in the text any way. Infocom, who were always
trying to give their customers games of high quality, realised that such garish
pictures only served to detract from the game, so they consciously chose not to
include them. Trouble was, as computers developed, more and more game players
wanted graphics, a market companies like Sierra were only to glad to pursue.
However, it remained an anathema for Infocom."
132584: "What's anathema mean?" you ask dimly.
132616: "Something one hates," says the editor, "in my case it's IGNORANCE!"
132676: "What was Cornerstone?" you ask.
133048: platform and Apple Macintosh had become the standards for business
users.

"The company was sold to Activision, and following brief and failed
forays into graphical adventures and the disappearance of most of the original
staff, Infocom as we came to know and love it disappeared. Shogun is considered
the last release in the Infocom canon." The editor takes a handkerchief from
his pocket and sniffs into it.
133520: Roberts' TADS allows for the inclusion of graphics and other elements."
133576: "This friend of yours," you say, "what's he like?"
133622: oh the Colonel?" the editor harumphs. "Mad as flutes, he is. Quotes
Coleridge, stinks of vodka, has these strange headaches that come over him all
at once and rob him of the use of his eyebrows."
That's cleared that up then.
133784: "Inform?" you ask.
134052: " The editor gives his desk a couple of taps before saying, "this desk,
would you believe, is coded in Inform. There's a word we're supposed to say to
examine the code, but I can't for the life of me remember."
134204: and considering what you've done to my desk, you may well be aware that
it too is coded in Inform. I do want it back, you know?"
134296: "TADS?" you ask.
134424: "There was always a large number of people coding their own games,
weren't there?" you ask.
134492: "Yes, the home computer market was driven as much by people wanting to
learn how to write their own software as it was people wanting to use existing
packages. Youngsters would become millionaires off the back of their own
bedroom born games. Systems like Quill and PAWS turned up allowing for the
programming of quite simple text adventures, but they were advanced enough to
allow for companies like Zenobi to run for quite some time."
134796: "That was a Spectrum mail order company, wasn't it?" you ask.
134842: "Ah, getting onto familiar ground, what?" beams the editor, "Yes, John
Wilson's Rochdale based company, which he started in 1984. It started out as a
means for Wilson to distribute his own games, but he soon started distributing
games written by other authors. They're still around, too, although they don't
bring out new adventures these days.
135094: The memo was something of a surprise. You'd featured rather heavily in
the issue before, and had reasonably suspected that the editor wouldn't want to
see hide nor hair of you for a while. However, summoned you have been.

The
trouble with these meetings is, you'll never know where it'll lead; whether
he'll ask you to write a few hundred words for a box-out, or to spend a day
tramping round the London suburbs in search of the homes of C-list celebrities.
Maybe it'll just be a straight commission. And if you're really blessed, he'll
fall into the usual trap of rattling off so much information in the meeting
that you'll only need to transcribe what you can remember. Such are the
misdemeanours available to you when your boss is disturbingly well-informed and
in love with the sound of his own voice.

Still, you've not much time. Best get
your skates on, especially if the receptionist is in one of his difficult
moods...
135756: You managed to miss your meeting!
135780: There is a strange dark confluence in the middle of the room.
135824: "Great Scott!" cries the editor.
135852: "I trust sir is seeing to moving that monstrous desk to more apposite
quarters through the employ of some sort of supernatural craft?" the
receptionist asks.
135964: A breeze blows towards the centre of the room. There is a flash and the
desk is no more. In its place lies a piece of computer paper.
136060: Such powerful words ought not to be spoken while you're carrying the
piece of paper, no?
136122: There is a strange dark confluence in the middle of the room.
136168: "Hang on to your hats, chaps!" cries the beamish editor.
136212: A breeze blows from the centre of the room. There is a flash and the
paper transmogrifies itself into a large mahogany and leather desk.
136308: "Such conjury may impress the unwashed classes, sir, but the truth
remains that you simply cannot leave that desk cluttering up my reception
area!" says the receptionist, trying to remain calm.
136444: Save for a slight increase in your embarrassment, nothing much happens.
136584: "I don't know anything about that,"
136700: You'll need to be more specific. Who
136752: You'll need to be more specific. Who
136804: You'll need to be more specific. Who
136856: You'll need to be more specific. Who
136960: That's not something you can ring, unless you want to ring it in biro,
using a pen you don't have.
137088: Much of this interactive article is conversational. You can ask people
about things and tell people about things using the ask and tell commands, such
as:
"ask receptionist about aspadistra" which you can shorten to:
"ask about
aspadistra"; or "ask aspadistra"; or even "a aspadistra".
137600: give" or test "has" or "hasnt" with a non-attribute on the object
137648: , but it is longer than 2 bytes so you cannot use "."
