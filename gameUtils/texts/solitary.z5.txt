Classes finally ended, and you walk home through the nearly deserted campus.
It's a Thursday, and you had night classes, so almost no one is around. Up a
few flights of stairs, you slip the key into the lock, turn, and walk inside.
Turning swiftly, you lock the door, and pick up your todo list. Still, you just
don't feel like doing work. Your heart is heavy, and you feel you won't really
be able to get anything done.
