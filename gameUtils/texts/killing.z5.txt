47160: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
47246: Doctor Proctor Phillips has been bothering the world for quite a long
time now.

First came the infamous Rabbits' Attacks, then the Tortoise
Kamikadzes, and after that - The Mouse Terrorists...

Everyone agreed something
had to be done about it, but no-one knew what - that's where you came in.

You,
Anthony Amerbach, one of the most extravagant agents the world had ever known.
You don't have the charisma of James Bond or even the humour of Nick
Pirandello, in fact, you look as ugly as ten drunken goblins and speak like
someone who just inhaled too much cocaine.

But you do have one strength - you
love the extraordinary... And this Proctor turned out to be the most
extraordinary guy FBI has ever faced (much worse than the infamous
cannibalistic doctor).

So you were told to go to Proctor's secret hideout...
Surprisingly enough, you not only found out its location in a pretty ordinary
Chinese atlas (sold only in Krasnoyarsk), you also got there without much
problems (ten battleships and five submarines shooting torpedoes don't count).
48004: You're standing on a beach... Once it was famous among sunbathers for
its unique location - only here you can get a tan in ten minutes - but then
Doctor Proctor arrived, built an ugly tower, created some monsters, and - all
the rest is pretty usual - banned alcohol. This the celebrities couldn't take!
That's why the area is empty...

From the east you can hear noices usually
heard in the zoos' apes sections.

Some monsters are visible west from the
beach.
48332: The monkeys were prepared for your arrival. They already loaded a
cannonball into the cannon, now they shoot it at you, making the world safe for
tyranny.
48440: Your boat sits in the water.
48460: This boat is over ten days old, and that's already looking old - no
surprise! After all, it was shot at ever since Arhangelsk where you started
your long journey. What's strange is how it survived at all...
48608: You would love to carry all your things around (especially in such a
situation), but this enormous motor boat is too much even for a strong secret
agent!
48716: Your gun lies on the sand.
48968: You take the gun again (a psychologist would probably use some pretty
long words to describe your behaviour).
49044: You drop the gun back in the sand. Now why did you do that?
49086: As you look around from behind a big stone (thankfully, you weigh enough
stones to fit there), you sigh wearily... As always, the road to the island is
guarded.

You can hear some strange noices from the south.

At the north you
see a lot of rocks.

Of course, you can also go back to the beach...
49306: There's nothing interesting here - because there's nothing in here...
Nothing except the remains of the poor creatures you killed and their computer
(you can't look at it, it's under their heavy bodies).

You can hear some
strange noices from the south.

At the north you see a lot of rocks.

Of
course, you can also go back to the beach...
49556: I wouldn't advise you to leave you hiding place! The monsters would
spring to action as soon as they hear footsteps.
49638: I wouldn't advise you to leave you hiding place! The monsters would
spring to action as soon as they hear footsteps.
49722: Now why you weren't careful? These damn monsters probablywere placed to
throw you off guard...

A carefully created contraption unwinds, and a rock
fall on you from above.
49846: You carefully crawl back to the beach.
49876: Two boar-headed monsters are playing "Quake".
49912: Well, they have muscular bodies (somewhat like Schwarzenegger's), but
they're... umm... boar-headed! Dammit, what else can I say?

You wonder why
modern evil doctors always create the same monsters. Do they all read one
neverending fantasy epic?

Currently the hideous creatures are trying to save
their brethren from an angry marine...
50160: This may be a strange game - but not THAT strange!
50198: You kill the monsters.

You feel nothing - it's all in a day's
work.

You leave your hiding place.
50276: Two monsters' bodies are lying on the sand.
50308: After you killed the boar-headed monsters with your gun, they -
naturally! - fell to the ground, crashing their beloved computer.
50400: Release your anger! Go to the Dark Side!

Doctor Proctor Phillips needs
you!
50460: This is the strangest suggestion I ever heard!
50496: This room is practically littered with machines, devices, gizmos,
gimmicks, thingumabobs, thingumajigs... damn, I should get either an education
or a thesaurus!
50612: There's a lot of strange machines in the room...
50648: Sorry, I can't tell you anything - I'm not an expert... Nothing rings a
bell here.

Hey, wait, that's not true! Something just did!
50750: There's a lot on unfamiliar machinery standing about.

In the depth of
the mess something is ringing quietly...
50834: You look at the detonator and smile to yourself - it's made from the
proper irony iron!

Not much more can be told about it - it's a long white tube
with a red button on the side.
50964: You carefully pick the dangerous machine up.
50996: Yes, I know, the world is pretty unpleasant... However, destroying it is
what the politicians are good at, and you should concentrate on your present
goal.
51108: You look around.

You think...

You don't see any other choice.

You
push the button.

The secret device in your spinal cord beeps.

You start
counting. Ten, nine, eight, two...

FLASH!

It worked! You're at the FBI
headquarters!
51348: A perfectly ordinary button.
51368: You have finally reached your destination!

And, frankly, it's a bit of
an anticlimax - the room isn't much to look at... You expected something weird
- say, a location filled with "No smoking!" and "No drinking!" posters - but
this is a usual room seen not only in a hundred mission, also in a thousand
movies.

That is, it's filled with countless tables filled with debris -
results of the previous experiments - and an equal amount of
equipment...

There's only one unusual thing - an absolutely clean desk in the
centre of the room...

The chair on which the Doctor is sitting is definitely
taken from one of the abandoned tourist attractions.
51834: It's a red IKEA chair.

Tourists love them. Workers hate them.
51886: There isn't a lot on the tables that you can recognize; here's the list:
human bodies, boar bodies, Coke cans, a lot of beer, bedsheets and - whatever
the reason - printed copies of SPAG and XYZZYnews magazines.
Clearly, something
horrible was going on in here!
52084: I told you before, DON'T ASK!
52112: The desk is incredibly tidy.

In fact, there's nothing on it but a
notebook. The Doctor either used some machine or married - everyone knows evil
maniacs can't clean after themselves.
52358: omedy series, a comic game based on a movie...
Currently Dr. Phillips is
trying to write a story-based expanded version of Matt Barringer's
"Detective"...
52476: Doctor Proctor sits at the desk, working on a plan to take over the
world and turn it into a theme park.
52548: Your enemy is about thirty years old, cleanly shaved, has no glasses,
his blonde hair is in ponytail... As you can see, not a usual evil maniac at
all!

What's more, he isn't creating an Army of Evil to take over the world,
what he is writing in a notebook (you can see this thanks to the special
contact lenses you're wearing) looks more like a scenario for a text adventure
that would capture people's attention for long enough...
52856: The doctor is quick enough to catch you if you try...
52896: Sure, forgiving your enemy is a nice concept for youngsters full of love
- but not for secret agents!
53004: Have you tried?
53016: I (Victor Verbitsky) am 20 years old and is a student of Russian State
University of Humanities (4th course).
53102: Yes, yes, that's right, a Russian!
53980: Ru" (I don't have my own)...
54006: This game was first written as a second "Detective" on 6th of June,
2000. It had everything - typos, strange direction changes, description errors;
but it also had two humorous bits (the "irony iron" - which I left in this
version - and a room description ending with five exclamation marks... Any
Pratchett reader knows it's "a sure sign of the insane mind".

This version has
all the elements out of there (including the "Use" command), but it also
contains some humoruous text and several more obstacles (like the necessity to
kill monsters so that you can proceed), but it also has much more freedom (you
can go back anywhere you like). There are also much better death description
(logical now, I think)...

I considered presenting this game as a conversion of
the old Spectrum title, but decided against it (after playing "Being John
Malkovich", where the humour style is quite like mine - mine in non-interactive
titles, that is). Why did I publish it? Well, you see, there are some other
projects I may release sometime (a story-based treasure hunt, a game based on
Russian folklore, another one based on Greek myths and a philosophical story
about a Romanian vampire), and I want my name to be known before that...

I'm
also proud of the text - try thinking in a foreign language sometime - but want
to know other's reactions before deciding to continue (I may abandon the genre
altogether).

I hope this game isn't "Detective II"!
55048: Going north from the monsters' room?
55078: Getting the gun, dropping it and getting it again?
55118: Shooting something other than the gun at something?
55158: Shooting the gun at something other than the monsters?
55200: Using the detonator not in the doctor's lair?
55236: Examining machines, detonator and Proctor?
55270: Examining the tables, the equipment, the desk, the chair, the furniture
and the notebook?
55340: Typing "wake" (this one is only for people who are replaying the game)?
55468: A hollow voice says "Long live the legend!"
55500: I understand you want to cause destruction, but this isn't that kind of
game!
