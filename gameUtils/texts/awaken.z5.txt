63892: Sorry, hints have been disabled.
63920: HINTS disabled.
64000: The bottle is made of a heavy, leaded glass and closed with a cork
stopper sealed with wax. Inside the bottle, an oddly shaped lead weight hangs
like a pendulum from a string. The bottle glows with a
64140: The blue bottle is warm to your touch as you pick it up. The warmth
seems to travel up your arm and into the center of your being. It is almost as
if you have found a missing part of yourself.
64272: You savor the warmth of the blue bottle as you pick it up.
64312: The green bottle has a sickly feel which matches its color. It feels
like ice, cold and burning at the same time. It is all you can do to keep from
throwing it down.
64428: You gingerly pick up the green bottle again.
64512: Rain and muddy water are pouring down on you, making it difficult to see
or even breathe. Sodden earth and mud surrounds you on all sides except
overhead, where flashes of lightning illuminate a storm tossed sky.
64660: Howling winds and the crashing of thunder assault your senses.
64704: As you scramble out of the hole the mud collapses downward, filling in
the hole behind you.
64768: You claw helplessly at the mud.
64792: Torrents of muddy water are pouring in from the opening overhead onto
you.
64844: The muddy water trickles through your fingers.
65000: You take a handful of muddy soil, but the rain washes it away.
65044: You would expect the storm to have cleared the air, but over the whole
area hangs a fetid odor of decay.
65116: It is not yet that time...
65136: That is no longer your place.
65184: Some force on you increases as you try to leave the area.
65224: A blast of thunder rattles the ground.
65252: With a loud CRACK, a bolt of lightning strikes the steeple of the
church.
65308: Momentarily, the wind and rain slacken then return with renewed force.
65358: Lightning arcs overhead, followed instantly by a blast of thunder.
65408: For a brief moment, hail pounds against you then subsides.
65452: Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain.
Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable
sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even
the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence
surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of
the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.
65756: You smell the odors of wet earth, the wild scent of the storm, and,
under it all, the lingering charnel odor of decay.
65840: The graveyard is surrounded on all sides by an iron-barred fence. The
only exit is through the gate to the east.
65920: Dozens of stone slabs mark the final resting places of those who have
departed. All are old, the inscriptions worn away and covered with moss and
mold, they tilt at odd angles. Many have fallen and are now half buried in the
mud.
66080: Few of the inscriptions are legible. Those that remain contain only
those sentiments that are placed there for the benefit of those who gaze upon
the stones, not those buried beneath them.
66212: The stone topples over into the mud.
66240: You strain and lift the stone slightly from the mud, then it slips and
falls over with a splash.
66308: This large branch has broken off from one of the trees and fallen on one
of the graves, shattering it's marker.
66388: A smaller limb has broken off of the branch and is lying nearby.
66434: A large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed the
grave marker below it.
66504: A smaller limb has broken off of the branch and is lying nearby.
66552: The branch is too large to move, but a smaller limb has broken off and
is lying nearby.
66612: You shove the branch around, to no real effect.
66648: A stout oak limb, about as long as you are tall.
66684: The marker for this grave has been shattered by the fall of a large
branch from the overhanging tree. The grave itself has been disturbed; the soil
has fallen in to form a shallow pit.
66812: There is no need to collect the shattered remains of the marker.
66856: The inscription is no longer legible.
66884: Mosses and molds cover the ground and the grave markers. There is
something sickly looking about them, as if they are the physical manifestations
of some kind of poisons in the soil. At any rate, they are alone in the
graveyard, as no grasses or weeds grow within its boundaries.
67076: You pull up a handful and examine it briefly before tossing it back
down. You see no use in carrying it with you.
67156: The moss and mold is far too wet to burn.
67188: This side of the church is untended and grasses and weeds have run
rampant. A muddy trail leads back to the graveyard to the west and on to the
southeast and a faint path continues around the church to the northeast.
67336: There is no entrance into the church on this side.
67372: Simply a worn trail through the grass, it leads around the church to the
northeast and southeast and west to the graveyard.
67592: A faint path continues around the church to the southeast and the
southwest.
67644: There is no entrance into the church on this side.
67680: A barely visible rut in the grass leads around the church to the
southeast and southwest.
67744: This wide, graveled clearing may have once been where the worshippers at
the church left their vehicles while attending services inside. If so, it seems
that the last service was held long ago. Weeds and grasses grow up through the
gravel, which is littered with debris. Dark, looming trees surround the
clearing except for the driveway, which leads to the southwest, and for a
narrow opening to the northwest.
68028: There is no entrance into the church on this side.
68064: Dirty chunks of rock mix with mud to create a more or less level
surface.
68116: You already have a handful of gravel.
68144: You dig a small hole in the gravel which the storm immediately fills in
with rain and mud.
68208: A handful of loose, muddy gravel.
68232: You toss down the gravel which scatters across the ground.
68272: You toss down the gravel which scatters among the debris on the floor.
68320: The gravel scatters across the ground and is lost.
68356: Scattered sticks, leaves and bits of trash cover the gravel clearing.
68404: You see no need to carry the trash around with you.
68440: Two massive oak trees which flank the cracked sidewalk dominate the
front of the church. The facade of the church itself rises beyond them, its
steeple silhouetted against the sky. The storm lashes at its faded white
facade, almost as if the storm is trying to wash the church clean; something
you somehow realize will take more than mere water to accomplish. To the north,
a sidewalk leads to the front of the church. A weed-choked driveway runs to the
northeast and down a hill to the south, and a muddy path leads around the
church to the northwest.
68856: The tree trunks are too slick with rain to climb.
68892: These massive trees are easily hundreds of years old. They tower over
the front of the church, climbing almost as high as the steeple. Unlike the
forest surrounding other parts of the grounds they are almost unnaturally
healthy, their branches clean and straight and their leaves a deep rich green.
69096: The trunk is too rain-slick to climb.
69124: The dog is slavering and barking wildly as it throws itself at you again
and again.
69184: This large, solid black dog is chained to one of the oak trees. There is
something disturbing about the shape of it's head; it seems to be too large and
slightly misshapen and an unnatural intelligence can be seen behind its red
eyes.
69348: A formidable looking guard dog stands here.
69378: The dog snarls and snaps at you as you reach for it and you draw your
hand back hurriedly.
69444: Angered at your attack, the dog charges at you!
69480: The dog growls and snarls angrily, snapping at your legs.
69522: The dog leaps at you, raking your chest with its claws and leaving a
trail of red.
69582: You feel a flash of searing pain as the dog latches onto your side with
its teeth.
69642: The dog finally manages to latch onto your throat. Your last sight is of
your blood splattering onto its face.
69722: The dog growls at you threateningly.
69782: The dog lunges after you, but is suddenly jerked to a stop with a yelp. 
The dog has been brought up short by it's chain, which is now completely
wrapped around the church.  It barks wildly but ineffectually at you as you
continue on around the corner.
69960: Satisfied, the dog wanders off back to the Front of the Church.
70024: It has rusted slightly but is still more than sturdy enough to hold the
dog.
70142: A heavy chain stretches around the church to the northwest and
southwest.
70196: A heavy chain is wrapped around the church, disappearing to the
northeast and southeast.
70258: A heavy chain disappears around the east and west corners.
70304: The dog probably wouldn't like you to be pulling on its chain.
70348: The limbs of the tree are swaying violently from the storm, but near the
trunk it is a little more stable. You have an excellent view from here of the
church grounds and surrounding area. The church seems to be in a clearing on a
hill surrounded by a forest. At the base of the hill a small town can be seen,
its lights glimmering faintly through the storm. 

One of the branches of the
tree reaches out to the north towards the steeple of the church. An open frame
can be seen in the steeple near where the branch ends.
70708: Throwing caution to the winds, you leap out of the tree and into space.
The wind howls around you as you plummet to the ground. Your last sight is the
church steeple, silhouetted by the lightning against the sky.
70856: You cannot climb any further up and the trunk of the tree is too slick
to climb down.
70948: The drop to the ground below is too far for you to jump safely, and the
trunk of the tree is too slick to climb.
71028: The tree branch sways alarmingly in the wind but seems quite sturdy. It
passes very close to the open window frame in the steeple.
71120: The branch is securely attached to the tree.
71152: A wide flagstone path leads between the two oak trees to the front of
the church. The earth has shifted, causing the stones to tilt at odd angles,
and weeds and grass grow in the cracks between the flagstones.
71296: You attempt to lift one of the flagstones, but it slips and falls back
with a squishing splash.
71364: A rutted, gravel covered path.
71388: The ivy is thick and luxuriant and somehow disturbing. The shapes of the
leaves are not quite wholesome and you wonder what strange sustenance it is
drawing from beneath the moldering ground.
71520: The ivy is sick and yellowed looking but somehow clings to the side of
the church as if it is trying to distance itself from the rocky soil.
71616: The rain-soaked vines tear loose in your hands, covering you with wet
leaves and sticky sap.
71680: The vines pull away easily enough, but maintain a tenacious hold on the
ground that you are unable to break.
71756: These ancient, twisted trees surround and even invade the graveyard. Now
tossed wildly by the storm, their branches reach skyward while their roots suck
unholy nourishment from between the broken slabs.
71896: The trees wave wildly in the wind, their twisted limbs seeming to reach
out to claw at the side of the church. No birds or forest animals inhabit their
branches; a repellent air surrounds them that seems inimical to any such
invasion.
72060: The trunk is too wet and rain-slick to do that safely.
72100: The howling wind sends the clouds racing across the sky. The almost
constant flashing of lightning illuminates the landscape in stark black and
white contrast, while the barrage of thunder joins with the wind in a mad
concaphony.
72256: The rain pours downward, pelting you painfully and almost blinding you
with its intensity.
72320: A thin layer of mud covers the rocky soil.
72352: You take a handful of muddy soil, but the rain washes it away.
72396: You are only able to dig a few inches before striking rock, and the rain
rapidly washes more mud in to fill up the hole you make.
72604: You pull up a handful and examine it briefly before tossing it back
down. You see no use in carrying it with you.
72684: The grass and weeds are far too wet to burn.
72716: The old church has seen better days. Formerly painted white, the boards
are now faded, peeling and rotted. Most of the windows are boarded up, and
those that aren't have long since been broken out. The shingles have fallen
from the roof, which sags alarmingly. A broken-tipped steeple rises from one
end of the building, and a faint miasma of decay seems to rise from the
structure.
72982: A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression
that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.
73078: To the east, the wall of the church breaks some of the force of the
wind.
73132: The south wall of the church looms blankly overhead.
73170: To the west, the church stares out over the clearing.
73212: The church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames seeming
to stare with judgment upon anyone standing before it.
73300: The steeple of the church looms to the north.
73336: Pointing heavenward like some broken, accusing finger, the steeple rises
from the front of the church. The steeple ends in a ragged, blunt tip; whatever
decoration may have once surmounted it is long gone.
73480: Once, the windows were probably told stories of hope and redemption in
brightly colored stained glass. Now, they are boarded up as if the church has
closed it's eyes to the world outside.
73612: The boards are nailed firmly in place.
73640: This wide, covered porch spans the width of the church front. A white
picket railing surrounds the porch on three sides, except to the south where a
short flight of steps leads down to the sidewalk. Two large windows have been
boarded up but the main doors stand slightly ajar.
73832: The floor here is old, but still pretty solid.
73868: The railing is too rickety to climb.
73896: There is no way off the porch in that direction.
74008: One section of the railing seems fairly unsteady.
74044: One section of the railing is missing.
74072: With a jerk, you tear free the loose section of railing.
74112: The rest of the railing seems fairly steady.
74144: The railing consists of two parallel lengths of wood about an arm's span
apart connected by wooden pickets. If stood on end, the rail would be about
twice your height.
74304: The broken length of railing is propped up against the side of the oak
tree.
74358: The broken length of railing is propped against the wall near the
painting.
74416: The broken length of porch railing is lying here.
74452: You carefully place the length of railing under the trap door in the
ceiling.
74508: You lean the length of railing against the side of the oak tree.
74552: You lean the length of railing against the wall near the painting.
74598: You carefully climb up the length of railing, using the pickets like a
ladder.
74656: The railing doesn't lead anywhere.
74684: The railing doesn't lead anywhere.
74712: The railing consists of two parallel lengths of wood about an arm's span
apart connected by wooden pickets. If stood on end, the rail would be about
twice your height.
74828: The top of the broken section of railing is visible sticking up through
the trap door in the floor.
74898: The broken length of railing is propped up against a nearby branch.
74948: You are precariously balanced on the top of the broken section of
railing.
75000: You attempt to pull the railing up after you, but you cannot get enough
leverage to do so.
75064: It is not yet that time...
75084: That is no longer your place.
75108: There is no passage in that direction.
75136: A blast of thunder rattles the building.
75166: You hear a loud crash and see a flash of light through the cracks in the
boards covering the windows.
75238: The building shudders under a sudden gust of wind.
75276: A flash of lightning can be seen through the cracks between the boards,
followed by a sudden blast of thunder.
75354: There is a brief rattle of hail on the roof.
75388: This small room is the entryway for the church. The years of neglect are
obvious; the floorboards are rotten and warped and what were probably once
stained glass windows are shattered and boarded up. Dirt and debris covers the
floor. A set of double doors leads south back to the outside while a large
archway leads north into the sanctuary. Overhead, there is an open trap door in
the ceiling at about twice your height.
75680: The opening in the ceiling is too far up for you to reach.
75720: The opening in the ceiling seems to lead to another room overhead, but
there doesn't seem to be any way to get to it.
75804: Once the heart of the church this room is now cold, dark and empty.
Debris is scattered among the sagging pews and only shards of broken glass
remain of the stained glass windows. Most of the interior fixtures have been
removed, but a large portrait of Christ stares down at you from above the
archway to the south. The pulpit still stands to the north.
76048: You pray, with no result. You sense somehow that your prayers are not so
much being unheard as they are ignored.
76128: A simple raised platform at the front of the church, it supports a
simple wooden podium.
76192: Once, these rows would have been filled with worshippers. Now, they only
contain dust and debris.
76264: You sit in the pew. For a moment, the storm seems to retreat and you are
blessed with a brief moment of peace.
76344: You are standing on top of the railing section near the large painting
of Christ. From this location, you notice that the eyes in the painting are cut
out and there are holes behind them.
76476: "Down" is really your only option.
76504: The eyes of the painting are cutouts. There are holes and an open space
behind the eyes.
76568: You are looking into the small room in the steeple. You can see past a
faded purple curtain to a small table which is holding two heavy glass bottles.
76672: You find yourself looking into a small enclosed space covered with a
faded purple curtain.
76736: The two bottles of heavy glass are sitting on the table. One glows with
a vivid green light and the other with a pale blue light.
76836: You can't do anything to the green bottle from here.
76884: You can't do anything to the blue bottle from here.
76920: From this raised platform you can see the entire inside of the church.
The pulpit is empty except for the podium which rises from the center. A small
door is visible behind the podium to the north.
77056: You pray, with no result. You sense somehow that your prayers are not so
much being unheard as they are ignored.
77136: This carved wooden podium is where the leader of this church would have
addressed his or her followers. Now, from the podium, you can only see rows of
empty pews and a lone painting of Christ, staring blankly down from the south
wall.
77300: A large black book is resting open on the podium.
77336: At first you thought this book was a Bible, but now you realize that you
were mistaken. The large, black, leather-bound tome contains passages you find
disturbing, and uncomfortably familiar.
77640: Through the eyes the soul may seen by those who are sensitive, and
through the eyes the soul my be taken by those who have pledged themselves to
the ones who wait beyond."
77818: you remember standing in this church and looking at that painting. And
you remember it staring back at you, with malevolent, vivid green eyes...
77920: The painting is too high up on the wall to do anything with.
77964: There is something unusual about the eyes of the painting, but it is too
far away to see clearly.
78032: This small office has the same run-down appearance of the rest of the
church. Debris covers the floor and a trickle of water comes in around the
boards covering a broken window. A desk stands in the middle of the room and an
empty bookshelf sits against one wall. A pile of ashes marks where a fire once
burned in the middle of the floor. A door to the south leads back to the
sanctuary.
78300: An old wooden desk. Scarred and water-damaged, it has been here for some
time.
78356: A warped, wooden bookshelf.
78376: You push the bookshelf to one side, revealing an old book bound in a
strange reddish cover.
78440: There seems to be something between the bookshelf and the wall.
78484: A very old volume, bound in some strange reddish material. At first you
thought it was leather but it seems to be more closely akin to snakeskin. The
book seems to be a weird grimoire or spellbook and mostly concerns the soul or
spirit.
78646: The book contains several rituals and procedures all involving the soul
or spirit.  The first describes a ritual through which the soul can be removed
from a person's body and placed in a specially prepared container. The soul
remains in the container even if the person's body dies.

A second ritual can
be employed to use the stored soul as a receptacle for the sin of another
person.  This allows the possessor of another's soul to perform any acts they
wish without having to answer for those acts in the next world.
79008: An old book lies on the desk.
79032: A book of blank pages, the kind that would be used to keep a ledger or a
journal. Unfortunately, someone has torn out most of the pages and only blank
sheets remain.
79148: A book of blank pages, the kind that would be used to keep a ledger or a
journal. Someone has torn out most of the pages, but the ashes have made the
indentations from the last entry legible.
79280: Looking carefully at the book you notice that the last entry must have
been made with great force. The entry has left indentations on the first blank
page in the book.
79594: I only hope that the taint of that which I have done has not stained her
irrevocably and that she will go to her proper place after I release her... and
that I shall go to mine."
79720: It seems as if a good sized fire once burned here; it is amazing that
the entire room did not catch fire. From the occasional bit of unburned
material it seems as if whoever built the fire was burning books, probably from
the now empty bookcase. Mixed in with the ashes you find a number of jagged
shards of glass.
79936: You already have a handful of ashes.
79964: A handful of old ashes.
79984: You toss down the ashes, which scatter in the wind.
80020: You toss down the ashes, which scatter among the debris on the floor.
80068: As you rub the ashes against the page, the indentations fill in and the
last entry becomes visible.
80136: A number of shards of broken glass lies mixed in with the ashes. From
the look of the fragments, it was some kind of thick walled bottle that was
smashed into the floor.
80252: A curious object lies in with the shards of glass. It looks like a heavy
rubber stopper with a chain hanging from it.
80336: You cut your finger on the glass as you attempt to pick it up.
80380: A heavy rubber stopper, such as would be used to close a bottle. Bits of
wax still cling to the edge showing where the bottle was sealed with the
stopper in place. A fine chain hangs from the stopper and ends in an oddly
carved lead weight.
80548: A richly embroidered robe hangs beside the door.
80584: Richly embroidered red robes, such as might be worn for ceremonial
purposes.
80640: This small chamber is about halfway up the steeple of the church. Rain
and wind from the storm outside blows in through an open window frame and water
collects in puddles on the warped floor, mixing with the droppings of the
birds, or perhaps bats, which can be heard fluttering around overhead. Looking
up, you can see a maze of beams and supports that form the interior of the
steeple. Rain pours in from an opening higher in the steeple and trickles out
through a trap door in the floor.
80976: There is no good way to climb upwards from here.
81012: The drop to the floor of the vestibule below is too far for you to jump
safely.
81068: Even with the door open and the wind from the storm blowing in this room
is rank with a fetid odor. The floor is piled high with trash and half eaten
scraps of food. There are no windows, only the broken door frame to the south.
An old sofa is pushed against one wall and a heavy table sits in the middle of
the room. A curtained archway is to the north.
81312: The room smells of urine, sweat and rotting food.
81348: This heavy wooden door looks to be newer and of more sturdy construction
than the rest of the church. A large, heavy handle is set into the door.
81480: Only the splintered remains of the frame remain.
81544: The heavy wooden door to the north is closed.
81576: The curtain is an old and faded purple. It looks as if it may have been
a tablecloth initially.
81642: A curtain of purple cloth hangs in the archway.
81678: You push the curtain aside and pause. On the other side of the curtain
is a room much like the one you are in. A figure stands in the archway,
apparently about to enter your room, and it is the sight of this figure which
has brought you up short. It is, or was, human... once. Now, it is a withered
mass of decaying flesh. It's clothing hangs in tatters and it is caked in mud
and grave mold. Patches of hair hang from it's scalp and bones are visible in
places through it's skin. The only thing that remains intact are it's eyes;
pale blue and now wide open and staring.

The creature raises its hand to you,
and you find yourself doing the same. You reach out your arm and touch...




...a cold unyielding surface of polished glass.



Suddenly, the
realization of what you are seeing comes home to you, and you step back from
the mirror with a cry.
82288: You glance towards the mirror but realize that there is no need to enter
its reality, for the reality in the mirror is your own.
82376: A highly polished mirror in a plain wooden frame. The mirror reflects
the contents of the room you are in and you find yourself averting your gaze
from what you see there. You note that the mirror frame is hinged on one side.
82532: A highly polished mirror in a plain wooden frame. The mirror has been
swung away from the wall, revealing two holes at about eye level.
82628: The mirror doesn't swing any further from the wall.
82664: You swing the mirror away from the wall, revealing a pair of holes cut
in the wall behind it.
82728: The mirror is firmly against the wall.
82756: You swing the mirror back against the wall.
82788: The holes are small, about the size of your thumb, and are at about eye
level.
82844: You look through the holes and find yourself looking down into the
sanctuary of the church with a clear view of the pulpit. From the angle, you
realize that you are looking down through the eyes of the painting of Christ.
82996: You find yourself looking down into the sanctuary of a church. Rows of
dust covered benches face a raised pulpit and podium.
83114: Curious symbols are carved into the wood and the top is oddly stained.
83164: The table is too heavy for you to move.
83192: A sudden desire to rearrange the furniture?
83270: The glass chimney is almost opaque with soot and grime.
83312: A pair of heavy glass bottles sit on the table.
83348: The bottles are made of a heavy, leaded glass and closed with a cork
stopper sealed with wax. Inside the bottles, an oddly shaped lead weight hangs
like a pendulum from a string. The bottles glow faintly.
83498: A cloud of faintly glowing blue mist rises from the bottle and hangs in
the air before you. You feel a brief moment of freedom, of release.

Then, you
realize that
83616: has started chuckling to himself. The first jolt of pain hits. The cloud
suddenly jerks and starts moving downward, as if drawn by a strong suction. The
pain intensifies and you drop first to your knees, then flat onto the ground as
if trying to follow the mist, which is now soaking into the earth. The pain
becomes excruciating. The last thing you see, as everything fades to black, is
83924: with a scream of "Noooo!", he throws himself towards you
84292: ! Fthagn...  Aaaaagh...!"

His body collapses to the ground.  As you
watch the body blackens and decays until, within only a few moments, what is
left appears to be a many-months old corpse.
84758: You watch for a moment as flames consume the church. With a crackling
roar, the steeple collapses inward and a plume of flame shoots
skyward.

Clutching the bottle to you, you make your way down the hill.
84904: An old sofa, so patched, faded and stained that its original color can
no longer be determined. An unidentifiable odor rises from it.
85000: is drawn and pale, his hair long and wild and his clothing filthy, torn
and unkempt. But, an active intelligence burns behind the vivid green eyes with
which he watches you; eyes which also contain a taint of madness.
85152: draws back as you approach. "Don't be foolish!" he hisses.
85196: laughs softly. "Do you think your opinions matter to me anymore?"
85244: looks around. "Yes.. I knew you would return here. This is your home...
only one you have left. The villagers would not have welcomed you before; they
certainly will not now. And besides, the bottle will keep you here. *I* will
keep you here."
85490: they would rather stay with their pathetic, safe god than open their
eyes to the true masters of the universe. You understood. You saw. Then, they
caused you to doubt yourself. Caused you to doubt your decision."
85640: "Why, to become immortal, of course! But, you changed your mind. You
freed her; freed her soul. But she had already absorbed too much of your sin,
hadn't she? She went to eternal punishment, for *your* sins. And so, you tried
to to kill yourself. But, you forgot about this, didn't you? You forgot where
*your* soul was.
85884: "I still don't know what your fascination with her was. Certainly the
other villagers never approved of your 'relationship'."
85976: laughs. "What did you expect? After you saw what happened to *her* and
realized that *you* were the one responsible you went, shall we say, mad? You
always were weak. There was only one thing to be done, wasn't there?"
86140: "Beautiful, aren't they? That's what *you* used to say. I remember how
you used to stare at them for hours. How you used to try to understand them...
86256: "Yes. That is you. Or, should I say, *was* you. It's *mine* now. The
receptacle for *my* sin.
86340: "You see, I am safe now... I have transferred my sin to your soul. *If*
I ever decide to release it, I will go to *your* reward, while you will go to
*my* punishment."
86476: Safe, I promise you. They are safe.
86504: You never had the stomach to read it before. Why the interest now?
86552: A useful creature. Quite intelligent, you know.
86594: You've forgotten me? How could you forget Silas? Your servant... your
colleague... your... teacher...?
86676: easily avoids your blows. He stares at you with his vivid green eyes.
"You were no match for me before... You are certainly no match for me now!"
86784: The belfry of the church, high up inside the steeple. You are hanging
from a maze of support beams and trusses with the nearest solid floor far below
you. Large open frames give a view of the surrounding forest and of the town at
the base of the hill. They also allow the fury of the storm to pass in
unimpeded. You can see the branch of an oak tree just outside the southern
frame.
87048: You leap off of the support and plummet to the floor below. The last
thing you hear is the peal of thunder outside.
87128: You climb around on the supports a bit, but are unable to move much
further up or down the steeple.
87228: The rope swings freely from the bell again.
87260: There doesn't seem to be any way to climb higher into the steeple.
87308: The drop to the floor below is too far for you to climb safely.
87352: You climb around on the supports a bit, but are unable to make much
progress in that direction.
87420: This massive bell once summoned worshippers to the church. Now, it only
serves as the home for birds and rodents. The mount for the bell has broken on
one side, and the other is barely holding on. You are surprised that it has not
broken free and plummeted from the steeple before this.
87620: The bell lies half buried in the mud. The fall has cracked and dented it
to the point where it will obviously never ring again.
87708: A massive bell hangs here, from a damaged mount.
87806: A broken bell lies half-buried in the mud.
87840: The bell is far too heavy to move.
87864: You shove against the bell. For a few seconds, the support takes the
strain. Then, with a loud cracking noise, the bell tears loose from the beam
and falls from the steeple. You hear the sound of splintering wood from below
and then duck aside as the splintered remains of the door are pulled past you
and out the open window. A metallic crash is heard from the ground outside.
88124: A good shove would probably cause the bell to plummet from the steeple.
Of course, if it did, you would never be able to get it back up here again so
you decide against it for now.
88248: The bell has buried itself too far in the mud to move.
88286: A frayed but heavy rope hangs from somewhere overhead.
88352: The rope is tied to the handle of the door.
88384: A frayed but heavy section of rope.
88412: Trust me, suicide is *not* the answer here...
88452: The rope is already securely attached to the bell.
88488: But, the rope isn't tied to anything!
88516: You are unable to loosen the rope from where it is attached to the bell.
88640: You hear a metallic <CLANK> from somewhere overhead.
88684: The bell moves slightly in its mount and emits a metallic <CLANK>.
88740: The rope is securely attached and you can't go very far while holding
it.
88852: Rough hewn from wood, the beams and trusses are dirty and covered with
bird and animal droppings which make footing treacherous.
88940: The small town huddles at the base of the hill. A few lights shine
defiantly against the storm but for the most part it seems quiet, as if its
inhabitants are waiting inside their homes for the fury to pass them by.
89196: You have no use for any of the trash.
89224: Once these frames may have contained magnificent stained glass windows,
each showing in imagery some tale of religious significance. Now, only
fragments of colored glass remain. The frames are boarded up and the wind
whistles mournfully through the cracks.
89400: The boards are nailed firmly in place.
89428: "The Awakening" is a text adventure game. You interact with the game by
typing phrases like EXAMINE CHAIR or OPEN DOOR and the game responds by
describing the world around you and the results of your actions.
89806: In some locations IN or OUT work. You can also ENTER or CLIMB things.
90014: You can tell the game to always give the full description by entering
VERBOSE.
90076: You interact with the environment in many ways. You GET items to pick
them up and DROP items to put them down. You can also PUT items IN things or
GET items FROM others. Fairly complex sentences are possible, for example GET
THE RED BRICK AND THE BLUE BALL FROM THE METAL BOX THEN THROW THE BRICK AT THE
WINDOW is a valid input.
90364: You may encounter people or other creatures while exploring the world of
the game. You can ask these people questions by typing ASK person ABOUT topic
and tell them things by saying TELL person ABOUT topic. You can also SHOW them
things. You can ask them to do things with PERSON, COMMAND. For example, to ask
Bob to pick up the book, type BOB, GET THE BOOK.
90712: ) To get a list of everything you are carrying type INVENTORY (or I).
Some other useful commands you can try are PUSH, SEARCH, SHAKE, THROW, RUB,
KICK, CLIMB or READ. A part of any text adventure is learning what words the
game knows. "The Awakening" knows hundreds of words, so feel free to try
anything.
90964: If you get really stuck, you can access a hint menu at any time by
typing HINTS. If you would rather not be tempted, you can turn the hint feature
off by entering HINTS OFF.
91092: "The Awakening" is my first piece of interactive fiction. It is based
(very) loosely on several stories by H.P. Lovecraft, most notably "The
Outsider", "The Terrible Old Man" and "The Two Black Bottles".
91252: I mainly wrote "The Awakening" as a learning exercise. I had started
several other games, but they were all too big and I found myself becoming
overwhelmed by the scope of the game along with learning the language. I was
inspired to try a smaller game by the Textfire games which came out in April of
1998. "The Awakening" became much larger than any Textfire, but the inspiration
was there.
91532: It took longer to finish the game than I expected. My main problem
involved the rope that is encountered in the game. Originally, it was far more
complex than what is now implemented. Even what is there now doesn't work quite
as well as I would have liked.

93300: Well, things could be starting off better here. Let's start by going UP
to get out of this hole. Now, let's take a look around. Hmmm... Not much here.
Maybe the church to the east has something. So, let's go EAST.
93464: Not much here either. The main path seems to go to the southeast so
let's follow it to the SOUTHEAST.
93544: Nice doggie! Head NORTH to the front door. Oops! Guess that won't work.
How can we get past this dog? Maybe if we ATTACK THE DOG it will leave.
93662: That wasn't our best idea, was it? Better get out of here! Head off to
the NORTHEAST. The dog is still following us so let's go on around the church
to the NORTHWEST, SOUTHWEST and SOUTHEAST.
93826: Hey, that worked pretty well! While the dog is tangled up let's take the
opportunity and go NORTH.
93904: All right! Our first points! Let's look around here a bit then go NORTH
again. Not much better inside than out, is it? What's that trap door in the
ceiling for? Doesn't seem to be any way to get up there so let's explore down
here some more. Go on NORTH into the sanctuary.
94108: What a dump. Not much left except a painting so let's EXAMINE THE
PAINTING. That's interesting; apparently we've been here before. Head on to the
NORTH some more and let's see what else we can remember.
94272: EXAMINE THE PODIUM. Ah, a book. READ THE BOOK and see what else we can
discover. I don't know about you, but I'm getting the impression that this is
an unusual church. Let's head NORTH and check out the rest of the ground floor.
94458: This room looks interesting. EXAMINE THE JOURNAL on the desk then try to
READ THE JOURNAL. Well, somebody didn't like something they had written. SEARCH
THE JOURNAL and see if we can find out anything. Indentations... Well, I've
seen enough detective movies to know what to do next. EXAMINE THE ASHES then
GET THE ASHES. OK, now RUB THE ASHES ON THE JOURNAL. Now we're getting
somewhere! READ THE JOURNAL again.
94828: Starting to get a bad feeling about this? Too bad those books were
burned, they might have told us something. Think they (whoever "they" were)
missed anything? SEARCH THE BOOKCASE. Ah ha! PUSH THE BOOKCASE then READ THE
BOOK we have found.
95030: I'm starting to get a feel for what is happening here. EXAMINE THE GLASS
on the floor. Wonder what that was for? Well, there doesn't seem to be much
more to do here so let's go back SOUTH a few times until we reach the Vestibule
again. That trap door still looks inviting but we haven't found a ladder. Or
have we?
95270: Go SOUTH again to the Porch. EXAMINE THE RAILING. Well, it looks kind of
ladder-like, doesn't it? GET THE RAILING. Good thing this church is in such bad
shape. Now, go back NORTH and PUT THE RAILING UNDER THE TRAP DOOR. Now, CLIMB
THE RAILING.
95506: Hey, that worked! Let's see what we have here. Another door, let's try
and OPEN THE DOOR. Locked? Now what? Not much here except for this rope. I
guess it's a bell rope. PULL THE ROPE. Yep, a bell. I wonder if there's
anything else up there? CLIMB THE ROPE and find out.
95732: EXAMINE THE BELL. Well, maybe climbing that rope wasn't the best idea. I
mean, the rope seem sturdy enough but this bell seems ready to fall at any
point. PUSH THE BELL. Yes, fairly unstable. And that gives me an idea.
95906: First we need another way out of here. Let's check to the SOUTH. OK,
we're out on a limb. We can't get down from here without a ladder but we know
where one of those is, don't we?
96044: Let's go back NORTH then CLIMB THE ROPE again. Now, TIE THE ROPE TO THE
DOOR. Good idea, huh? Go DOWN then GET THE RAILING. Now, go SOUTH twice and PUT
THE LADDER AGAINST THE TREE. CLIMB THE LADDER and go NORTH.
96266: Now, PUSH THE BELL and duck. That worked better than I had hoped! Go
back SOUTH then DOWN. GET THE LADDER, go NORTH twice and PUT THE LADDER UNDER
THE TRAP DOOR again. Now go back UP. Looks like we can go NORTH now.
96472: Well, *this* is an interesting room, isn't it? Let's talk to the man in
here for a while. ASK THE MAN ABOUT... a few things. Doesn't seem too helpful,
does he? Well, let's do some more exploring on our own. Let's start by going
NORTH.
96666: Let's stop and reflect on this latest discovery a bit. Things are
apparently a little worse than we thought. Let's EXAMINE THE MIRROR again then
OPEN THE MIRROR. Now, LOOK THROUGH THE HOLES. Well, we know what was going on
with that painting now.
96876: OK, now let's EXAMINE THE BOTTLES on the table. EXAMINE THE BLUE BOTTLE
and EXAMINE THE GREEN BOTTLE. Now, think about what we've read, the broken
bottle we found, our "condition" and the distinctive feature of our "friend" on
the sofa. Well, there seems to be only one thing to do; OPEN THE GREEN BOTTLE
or BREAK THE GREEN BOTTLE.
97178: Guess he wasn't expecting *that*! Now, what do we do about *our*
situation? Looks like that will have to wait for the next game for that...
97292: Select a hint...
97318: You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence.
Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that something you
never knew you possessed has been lost.

Suddenly, oblivion is split by a
blinding light and a crash of sound. You awaken to the roar of a storm and a
deluge of rain and mud.
97586: "XYXXY!". The storm responds with a roar and a crash of thunder. It is a
word of power. Once, you feel, you knew many such words. Now, only this one
remains.
