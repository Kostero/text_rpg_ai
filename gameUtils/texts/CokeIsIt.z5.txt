"frog, again".

your Coke, though.
63352: To talk to someone, try "someone, drink coke" or some such.

Which exactly?
64180: Are you sure you want to quit? There's still some refreshing Coke left!
64232: Are you sure you want to restart? (Not that I blame you. That would
refill the refreshing Coke!)
64304: Restore failed. Console yourself with a refreshing Coke.
64348: Save failed. Drown your sorrows in refreshing Coke.

crucial Coke at this moment.

68552: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment. You also lack
the Coke at this moment.
68650: Ahhhh! Another can of refreshing Coca-Cola! You sigh in contentment as
you partake of the sweet carbonated beverage, so recently purchased. But what's
this? The dispenser light is still on! You can select another! You pause,
though. The labels seem to be different than they were before,...
68876: Of all the places in the world to obtain the sweet goodness of Coca-Cola
products, this has to be your favorite. The Coke machine dominates the
landscape, resting snugly against the perfect brick wall next to the unbroken
sidewalk, which seems to lead to untold possibilities, their potential unlocked
by the mere presence of Coca-Cola.
69112: You can't bring yourself to leave the Coke Machine. At least, not while
there are free buttons left to push.
69192: You are fit, happy, and healthy. You drink Coke!
69238: Slowly, your strange experience fades, and you are back to familiar
surroundings once more.
69306: With a wink, the 'Select!' button turns off, and you realize you have
finished the last selection. With a melancholy sigh, you turn to walk away down
the sunlit street, Coke grasped firmly in hand, ready to take on the world.
69472: Truly, all of your desires can be assuaged with the refreshing goodness
inside this can.
69536: You have already opened your can of Coca-Cola. You couldn't wait to
taste the delicious liquid inside!
69612: Once opened, a can of Coke cannot be closed. You have full access to the
delights therein in perpetuity (or until you drink it all, whichever comes
first).
69724: Aaaaah! What joy! What bliss! What unbearable ecstacy of delight!
69774: This Coke machine has served you well. It is always full, always has
exact change, always operates smoothly, and always keeps its assortment of
Coca-Cola products chilled at exactly the right temperature. Right now, though,
the buttons don't seem to have the same labels they used to. The 'Select!'
light is still on, meaning you can push the following buttons:
70036: You'll have to specify which button you wish to push.
70076: For some inexplicable reason, the machine is playing "Greensleeves".
70136: Sorry, the machine seems to be all out of that.
70170: Your surroundings melt away, and you find yourself in a completely new
place!
70228: The 'Select!' light burns cheerily from the side of the machine. You can
still select more of the great taste of Coca-Cola!
70328: This is a vast underground station in great rectangular caverns, deep
beneath the streets. You are outside the ticket gates, near a flight of steps
back up to the city, and since you haven't a ticket you're likely to stay that
way.
70488: Back up the stairs for you. Call yourself a traveller...
70532: His jumper is unstriped, and there are no onions around his neck.
Nonetheless he has a rather Gallic, disgruntled look to him. Perhaps he's a
former Socialist cabinet minister.
70660: Behind a kiosk, a surly-looking man is selling guide books and maps.
70708: It's not that he doesn't understand you, he's just obstructive for the
sake of it.
70776: And he folds his arms defiantly. Perhaps he has no such thing.
70820: He refuses to understand you, on principle.
70852: The man snatches the Coke from you, sneers, and drains it in one huge,
unhurried swallow.
70918: He glares at you for a moment, and then a change ripples across his
features. "Merci," he croaks in a voice unaccustomed to politeness. He
shudders, and then shakes himself like a dog exiting water.
71062: He stares down at his jumper in disbelief, and rips it off, revealing a
New York Giants T-shirt underneath. He shakes his head, clears his throat, and
tries again.
71184: "Thanks, buddy!" he exclaims, in what is manifestly a New Jersey, rather
than a French, accent. "This is in-
71300: He shrugs and hands you the map of Paris. You feel a shiver ripple
through the multiverse as the ancestral Curse of the Meldrews is lifted.
71400: you'd wanna go there, though. It's all covered in
71518: He scratches his head, encountering his beret, which he flings into the
darkness.
71698: Arm in arm, the two of you leave the Underground behind. After a
fantastic vacation in Atlanta, the highlight of which is (of course) the "World
of Coke" exhibit, you somehow find yourself...
71844: "Ceci n'est pas argent," he explains wearily.
71884: As good-looking as ever.
71910: 2. Phone airport to check parking.
71996: Truly, all of your desires can be assuaged with the refreshing goodness
inside this can.
72060: You have already opened your can of Coca-Cola. You couldn't wait to
taste the delicious liquid inside!
72136: Once opened, a can of Coke cannot be closed. You have full access to the
delights therein in perpetuity (or until you drink it all, whichever comes
first).

72308: You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
Coca-Cola...Along The Highway To Anywhere, Around The Corner From Everywhere,
Coca-Cola is The Best Friend Thirst Ever Had. A small stream flows out of the
building and down a gully.
72500: You look like you could use a Coca-Cola.
72634: The Interactive Original, brought to you by Coke:
72676: By Will Crowther (1973) and Don Woods (1977)
Reconstructed in three
steps by:
Donald Ekman, David M. Baggett (1993) and Graham Nelson (1994)

Painted on the building is a message.
72972: . The full list is hidden somewhere, too, in case you want to know what
you're looking for. (TXD'ers, this one's for you...)

Have fun!
73076: You have taken a drink from the stream. The water tastes strongly of
minerals, but is not unpleasant. It is extremely cold, like Coca-Cola: Ice-Cold
Sunshine.
73192: You have nothing in which to carry the water.
73224: You have nothing in which to carry the water.
73256: The road is dirt, not yellow brick. Wherever You Are, Whatever You Do,
Wherever You May Be, When You Think Of Refreshment, Think Of Ice-Cold
Coca-Cola.
73380: The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
occasional grove of pine or spruce. There is quite a bit of undergrowth,
largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of various sorts. This
time of year visibility is quite restricted by all the leaves, but Thirst Knows
No Season. Travel is quite easy if you detour around the spruce and berry
bushes.
73644: You have walked up a hill, still in the forest. The road slopes back
down the other side of the hill. There is a building in the distance. Where
There's Coke, There's Hospitality.
73776: It's just a typical hill.
73800: Why not explore it yourself?
73820: You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring. Be Really
Refreshed: Drink Coca-Cola.
73896: The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer pipes. The
only exit is to the west.
73964: The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer pipes. It
would be advisable to use the exit. Catch The Wave, Red White & You.
74068: The pipes are too small.
74088: The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer pipes.
74136: Too small. The only exit is to the west. Coca-Cola Goes Along.
74184: It's just a normal-looking set of keys.
74216: There are some keys on the ground here.
74244: Sure looks yummy! Remember: Things Go Better With Coke.
74292: There is tasty food here.
74312: Delicious! Coca-Cola...Making Good Things Taste Better.
74360: There is a shiny brass lamp nearby.
74388: Your lamp is here, gleaming brightly.
74416: Your lamp is getting dim. Coke Adds Life.
74452: Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding. Be Really
Refreshed. Drink Classic Coke.
74524: Unfortunately, the batteries seem to be dead.
74556: The lamp is running at full power already.
74588: Say, that Coke really put the juice back into this thing! The Only Thing
Like Coca-Cola Is Coca-Cola Itself.
74672: That isn't appropriate fuel for the lamp.
74704: There is an empty green glass bottle here.
74736: You're holding that already (in the bottle).
74772: The bottle is only supposed to hold liquids. Try The Best Friend Thirst
Ever Had: Coca-Cola.
74844: The bottle is now full of ice-cold Coke.
74876: There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.
74912: Your bottle is now empty and the ground is now wet.
74952: If you want to pour the bottle of Coke, try "pour bottle ...".
75000: It looks like delicious, ice-cold coke to me.
75040: If you want to pour the bottle of water, try "pour bottle ...".
75088: It looks like ordinary water to me.
75116: You are in open forest, with a deep valley to one side. Drink Coca-Cola.
75172: You are in open forest near both a valley and a road. Coca-Cola Revives
And Sustains.
75236: You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a rocky
bed. Coke, Delicious And Refreshing, is collected in a bubbling, ice-cold pool
in the streambed.
75356: Delicious and refreshing, Coke Is It!
75388: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh. Sign Of Good Taste: The Cold, Crisp Taste Of Coke.
75444: You have nothing in which to carry the ice-cold Coke, but you Can't Beat
The Feeling.
75508: You have nothing in which to carry the ice-cold Coke, but We've Got A
Taste For You.
75572: Don't sully the pure, natural Coke spring with that!
75612: At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit in
the rock. Downstream the streambed is bare rock. Have A Coke And A Smile.
75720: You don't fit through a two-inch slit! What You Want is a Coke.
75768: You don't fit through a two-inch slit! What You Want is a Coke.
75816: It's just a 2-inch slit in the rock, through which the stream is
flowing. Coca-Cola: The Great National Temperance Drink.
75908: You don't fit through a two-inch slit! What You Want is a Coke.
75956: It would wash away, so you take it back out.
75988: The bottle won't fit through a two-inch slit.
76052: That doesn't fit through a two-inch slit.
76084: You carefully pluck out the scroll, a list of slogans.
76124: On close examination, you see a thin scroll tucked into the slit.
77264: You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt. Set into the
dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete. A dry streambed leads into
the depression.
77380: You're standing in it. Look Up America - Always Coca-Cola.
77428: It just looks like an ordinary grate mounted in concrete.
77468: The caves are too dark to explore without a lamp.
77504: You can't explore the caves with an unlit lamp.
77540: The lamp has run out of power. You can't explore the caves without a
working lamp.
77600: Your lamp is getting dim. It's not safe to explore the caves without a
brightly burning lamp.
77712: This demo is now over, but there's Always Coca-Cola!
77758: The grate stands open. Where There's Coke, There's Hospitality.
77820: The is the second half of the sterilization chamber leading from the
main lab to the Bio Lab. The door to the east, leading to the Bio Lab, has a
window. The bio lock continues to the west.
77956: You can't leave until you get what you came here for.
77996: Through the window, you can see a large laboratory, dimly illuminated. A
blue glow comes from a crack in the northern wall of the lab. Shadowy, ominous
shapes move about within the room.
78126: On the floor, just a short distance inside the door, you can see a thing
of beauty -- a gleaming can of Coca-Cola, framed by the light shining through
the window.
78248: The door to the lab, mercifully, is closed.
78280: The door to the lab, terrifyingly, is open.
78312: The biological nightmares reach you. Gripping coils wrap around your
limbs as powerful teeth begin tearing at your flesh. Something bites your leg,
and you feel a powerful poison begin to work its numbing effects...
78464: Dozens of hungry eyes fix on you as the mutations surround you and begin
feasting.
78520: Opening the door reveals a Bio-Lab full of horrible mutations. You stare
at them, frozen with horror. Growling with hunger and delight, the mutations
march into the bio-lock and devour you.
78656: The door opens and Floyd, pausing only for the briefest moment, plunges
into the Bio Lab. Immediately, he is set upon by hideous, mutated monsters!
More are heading straight toward the open door! Floyd shrieks and yells to you
to close the door.
78832: Floyd stumbles out of the Bio Lab, clutching the delicious-looking can
of Coca-Cola. The mutations rush toward the open doorway!
78926: You close the Bio Lab door. And not a moment too soon! You hear a
pounding from the door as the monsters within vent their frustration at losing
their prey. And, of course, their Coke.
79062: Floyd staggers to the ground, clutching the delicious can of Coke. He is
badly torn apart, with loose wires and broken circuits everywhere. Oil flows
from his lubrication system. He obviously has only moments to live.
79220: You drop to your knees and cradle Floyd's head in your lap. Floyd looks
up at his friend with half-open eyes. "Floyd did it ... got Coke. Floyd a good
friend, huh?" Quietly, you croon Floyd's favorite song: "I'd Like To Buy The
World A Coke".
79506: " he opens it. With his last strength, he sets the can on the ground
before you. His eyes close as his head rolls to the side. You sit in silence
for a moment, in memory of a brave friend who gave his life so that you might
have Coke. All in all, a fair trade, but admirable nonetheless.
79712: From its design, Floyd the robot seems to be of the multi-purpose sort.
It is slightly cross-eyed, and its mechanical mouth
79836: Your trusty companion, Floyd the robot, bounces to his feet as well.
"Hi!", he beams. "You sure are a sleepyhead."
79924: You manage to lift Floyd a few inches off the ground, but he is too
heavy and you drop him suddenly. Floyd gives a surprised squeal and moves a
respectable distance away.
80044: Floyd giggles and pushes you away. "You're tickling Floyd!" He clutches
at his side panels, laughing hysterically. Oil drops stream from his eyes.
80152: Floyd slaps your wrist and you back off.
80180: Floyd smells faintly of ozone and light machine oil.
80216: "Why you do that?" Floyd whines. "I think a wire now shaken loose." He
goes off into a corner and sulks.
80296: Floyd is uncharacteristically quiet. He seems pretty intent on
something.
80348: "Why you do that?" Floyd whines. "I think a wire now shaken loose." He
goes off into a corner and sulks.
80428: Floyd scratches his head cheerfully.
80454: "Irving the miniaturization-tech-person used to drink lots of refreshing
Coca-Cola. He was so absent-minded that he added RNA memory engrams to all Coke
in Complex, so he could remember his passwords. So for you to fix computer, you
have to drink Coke. Coke is It."

Floyd pauses for a moment, then glances
toward the lab door. "Looks dangerous in there," says Floyd. "I don't think you
should go inside." He peers in again at the Coke on the Bio Lab floor. "But
without refreshing RNA-enhanced Coca-Cola, you won't know minibooth code to fix
computer. Hmmm... I know! Floyd will get refreshing Coca-Cola. Robots are
tough. Nothing can hurt robots. You open the door, then Floyd will rush in.
Then you close door. When Floyd knocks, open door again. Okay? Go!" Floyd's
voice trembles slightly as he waits for you to open the door.
81072: Floyd, clearly uncomprehending, whistles cheerily.
81108: "No thanks!", Floyd says cheerfully.
81140: As good-looking as ever.
81166: Your surroundings melt away, and you find yourself in a completely new
place. 



You yawn, stretch, and roll over blearily. Suddenly, you feel a
sharp pain in your side! Your eyes snap open, just in time to see Floyd bend
over to poke you again. You leap to your feet.
81364: It is a standard-issue Stellar Patrol uniform, a miracle of modern
technology. It will keep its owner warm in cold climates and cool in warm
locales. It provides protection against mild radiation, repels all insects,
absorbs sweat, promotes healthy skin tone, and on top of everything else, it is
super-comfy.
81582: Floyd giggles. "You look funny without any clothes on."
81628: You suddenly realize how warm it is. You also feel naked and vulnerable.
A refreshing Coke would both cool you down and boost your confidence!
81728: Truly, all of your desires can be assuaged with the refreshing goodness
inside this can. Floyd's ultimate sacrifice was not in vain.
81820: From within the lab you hear ferocious growlings, the sounds of a
skirmish, and then a high-pitched metallic scream!
81902: You hear, slightly muffled by the door, three fast knocks, followed by
the distinctive sound of tearing metal.
81984: The three knocks come again, followed by a wild scream. Then, all is
silence from within the Bio Lab, except for an occasional metallic crunch.
82086: You feel a sinking sense of doom, not unlike that engendered by drinking
Pepsi.
82148: Floyd already opened your can of Coca-Cola for you. You can't wait to
taste the delicious liquid inside!
82224: Once opened, a can of Coke cannot be closed. You have full access to the
delights therein in perpetuity (or until you drink it all, whichever comes
first).
82334: Aaaaah! What joy! What bliss! You feel renewed strength and energy
coursing through your body. 

And -- what's that? There.

There, glimmering in
the corner of your mind: the access code to the teleportation booth. Floyd was
right.

Now it's up to you to make his sacrifice worthwhile. Casting a final,
sad glance at his mangled carcass, you stride off to the west...
82616: Your former companion, Floyd, is lying on the ground in a pool of oil.
82668: You turn to look at Floyd, but a tremendous sense of loss overcomes you,
and you turn to your Coke for solace.
82756: This room is empty except for a large machine bearing the label
"NUTRIMAT".
82816: You're too intrigued by the Nutrimat to leave.
82852: You're wearing a red dressing gown with white trim.
82888: Truly, all of your desires can be assuaged with the refreshing goodness
inside this can.
82952: You have already opened your can of Coca-Cola. You couldn't wait to
taste the delicious liquid inside!
83028: Once opened, a can of Coke cannot be closed. You have full access to the
delights therein in perpetuity (or until you drink it all, whichever comes
first).
83140: Aaaaah! What joy! What bliss! What unbearable ecstasy of delight!
83192: The gown is dappled with brown stains from having consumed past cans of
Coke a bit too eagerly.
83260: If you need to cool off, a better method is to drink some refreshing
Coca-Cola!
83320: The Nutrimat has a door which can be opened and a button which can be
pressed.
83376: A simple button, nothing more.
83400: "I already made you a beverage," says the Nutrimat.
83440: The Nutrimat produces a cup of fizzy brown liquid. "Share and enjoy!" it
remarks.
83500: This is the circuitry that runs the Nutrimat.
83532: That doesn't seem likely to be helpful.
83560: The Nutrimat emits a shower of sparks. "OH!" it cries. "So THAT'S what
Coca-Cola is! My circuits were previously unable to compute a substance so
crisp, so refreshing, so delicious!"
83700: This is a cup of fizzy brown liquid.
83728: PFAH! This beverage is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike Coke! You
dash the cup from your lips.
83804: This is a cup of fizzy brown liquid.
83830: AHHH! Now that's more like it! Crisp, refreshing Coca-Cola!

Marvin the
robot wanders into the room. "Oh my," he says. "Human, you have managed to
acquire both Coke and More Coke at the same time. Truly a sign of intelligence.
Well done."
84024: A bottle of some dark, fizzy substance. But it's definitely not Coke.
84076: If you'd like to drink it, at least be honest with yourself and just say
so. Otherwise, pour it someplace or something.
84160: The madness and confusion of this place drives you to
ever-more-desperate acts. But here, at the brink, you manage to summon your
courage and honor and draw back.
84276: You empty the substance out of the bottle. It sizzles as it falls
through the air, draining away only slowly after pooling on the ground.
84372: An empty glass bottle. Who knows what it might have held?
84416: The cap seems to have been lost someplace.
84448: The trees around you are spaced far enough to provide little shelter,
allowing the stinging rain to pelt you. A grey mist conceals everything past
four meters.
84558: You strike off in that direction, but soon become disoriented by the
rain.
84706: Your surroundings melt away, and you find yourself in a completely new
place.



Rain and mud. And the taste of something, sweet in your mouth.

Those
are your first solid memories. Rain pouring down on your head, filling your
eyes. Mud beneath your feet, filling your shoes. And, of course, there's always
Coca-Cola -- or is there? A sudden feeling of loss sweeps over you, and a chill
wind cuts through your clothes with ease.

Shelter would be a good beginning.
85048: Mostly pine. Their protection is scant comfort in the rain and the wind.
85100: Once the field might have been covered in grass. Now the grass is but a
memory. Mud covers the ground in its place, fed by the constant rain.
85200: As you walk away, the head screams at you. "Coward! You put me here!
Can't you at least get me something to drink?"  Disturbed, you keep walking.
85308: You strike off in that direction, but soon become disoriented by the
rain.
85364: Other than being buried in mud to his chin, the head is reassuringly
normal. His hair and mustache are a matted brown, perhaps from genetics,
perhaps from mud. Rivulets of water run down his creased face.
85508: Buried almost to its chin in the mud is a human head.
85548: You lean over him, place your hands on his forehead, and push. Hard. He
screams, eyes squeezed shut, as you bear down on his head. When you stop you
see that you have left a fiery red handprint on his forehead which is slow to
fade.
85712: You lean over him, place your hands over his ears, and pull. He shrieks
in pain, eyes squeezed shut. You quickly determine that he cannot be pulled
free of the mud. When you let go the man's ears are bright red.
85934: his cries are cut short as your foot slams into him. With the sound of
eggshells cracking, the head fragments into countless pieces which are quickly
lost in the mud.
86126: His cries are cut short as a stream of hissing liquid trickles into his
mouth. His head seems almost involuntarily to wriggle its way further down into
the mud, and quickly disappears. A few remaining drops of liquid drip from the
bottle and splash down onto the soil, cutting tiny trails to the northeast.
86336: The mud coating him makes you think twice.
86368: You kneel and begin scooping mud from around the head with both hands.
As fast as you remove the mud, more mud and water return. "Forget it," the man
says gruffly. "It's too late now." He seems strangely touched by your attempt,
however.
86538: "So thirsty ... So, so thirsty ..."
86572: The head licks dry lips with a almost-as-dry tongue.
86612: The head hums a Coke jingle to itself.
86642: "'Have A Coke and A Smile', they said. I'm smiling --" the head pulls
its lips into a cracked grin. "Where's my Coke?"
86740: The head glances northeast for a moment. "Just a sip, that's all I ask.
One little sip of Coke."
86812: "'I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke'. And I did. So you OWE me!" The
head's eyes flicker to the northeast.
86900: The viscous brown substance uniformly covers the ground.
86940: Your attempts result in dirty hands and no appreciable amount of mud.
86988: Slanting down in sheets, it soaks you to the bone.
87024: Looming suddenly out of the gloom is a large marble building. Its
columns jut skyward, raked by the unending rain. To the north lies its
entrance.
87126: As you walk through the door of the building the sound of the rain
stops, as if suddenly turned off.
87198: As you walk away, the building is quickly swallowed by the rain and
mist.
87252: The building's white marble is streaked with grime, the rain having no
visible effect. Its entrance lies open to the north.
87340: The two-story height of the foyer is channelled into a narrower hallway
to the north. On the north wall to the west of the hallway's beginning is an
open doorway. The building's entrance to the south is reflected in the marble
floor.
87502: You start to take a step out the door, then pause. Somehow, the weather
has turned from drenching rain to snow, colder than a Coke straight from the
fridge. You shiver and retreat back to the warmth of the foyer.
87656: An inner voice tells you there's no Coke that way.
87692: The floor reflects the ceiling back. For a moment, the light shifts, and
you think you catch a glimpse of a familiar red-and-white image; then the light
shifts again and the pattern vanishes.
87828: Like the foyer, the hallway is marble. Its two-story height combined
with its thinness inspires unease. A walkway runs above you, clinging to the
east and west walls. Below the east walkway is a doorway.
87972: The walkway rings the hall on every side but the south, casting a shadow
on the floor.
88032: It is cast by the walkway above. Opaque...no shadow should be so thick.
88084: The shadow is, nevertheless, insubstantial.
88116: The hallway ends abruptly in a pair of large oak doors. Their intricate
carving is barely visible in the leaden light from the windows above you. The
doors are flanked by two sweeping staircases to the northeast and northwest. A
doorway to the east is mirrored by
88300: You can go up to the northeast or the northwest.
88336: An inner voice tells you there's no Coke that way.
88400: The staircases curve as they climb to the walkway above.
88440: The carved doors are made of oak and are twice your height. They stand
slightly ajar, leaving enough room for you to enter.
88528: The doors have frozen in position over time. You cannot budge them.
88576: Tiny hieroglyphs seem to be in the form of a bottle, a plus sign, and a
baby. Interspersed between them are a pair of teeth chasing a candle and a
tadpole.
88684: Your footsteps echo hollowly in the dimly-lit and cavernous hall.
Benches line the floor, their rows skewed slightly to focus on the object at
the north end. A clock is set in the wall in plain view of the desk. The south
third of the room is covered by a balcony, reducing the height of the hall from
two stories to one. A small door to the east and two large doors to the south
stand ajar.
88956: An inner voice tells you there's no Coke that way.
88992: The Coke machine's lights are dimmed and the whole is covered with a
thin coating of dust. "What demon hath robbed thee of thy vigor, noble
machine?" you can't help but cry. Then you notice the power cord extending from
the back of the machine, hanging limp on the floor mere inches from a socket.
89200: A dust-covered Coke machine stands at the north end of the hall, the
focus of attention.
89262: You grunt with all your might and heave the coke machine onto your
shoulders. For a moment or two it looks as if you're not going to be able to
lift it, but heroically you finally lift it high in the air! Seconds later,
however, you topple underneath the weight, and the machine crushes you fatally.
Geez! Didn't I tell you not to pick up the coke machine?! Isn't the name of
this very game "Pick Up The Coke Machine and Die"?! Man, you're dense. No big
loss to humanity, I tell ya.
Also, not really.
Also, </obvious>.
Also, Awwwk!
Want Coke nut!
89672: The plug is a dusty black in color. It extends from the back of the
machine, just waiting to bring the electronic god to life again.
89764: Curses! Inches too short! What fiendish mind could have devised such a
Tantalus-like torture?
89832: Not without dropping the cord, you don't.
89864: It's an apparently ordinary light socket, tucked away against the wall.
89916: Somewhat unwisely, you jab the bottle opener into the socket. Current
flows through your body and you twitch like a trout on a hook.
90008: You grasp the power cable firmly and hope for the best. The Coke machine
hums to life as you cry out with the pain. Tragically, the last words you hear
before it all fades to black are a mechanical voice saying "I'm sorry, this
machine is all out of that selection. Please enter 75 cents and choose again."
90226: A great deal of mostly non-Coke related things occur.
90268: A red-faced clock with white hands. Above the hands is written the
inscription "It's always time for Coca-Cola".
90352: Just enough light filters in to show you row after row of boxes filling
rack after rack of shelves, making it difficult to find a place to stand. The
room continues to the north. Above the west exit is a clock.
90500: The shelves cover the room, as if they had multiplied in the same manner
Coke bottles in the fridge don't. There are few empty ones, as most are taken
up by boxes.
90616: The shelves seem to be for boxes only.
90644: Cardboard boxes, all taped shut. Each one has been labeled with a black
magic marker.
90704: The tape prevents you from oepning the boxes.
90736: Your eyes roam over their surfaces, taking in their titles. Many are
labeled "Bottled: " with a range of dates following. A few are labeled
"Carbonation." You feel an odd sense of disorientation as you stare at them.
90892: There are too many, and you have no way of determining which are
important.
90944: Metal shelves fill the hall; most are empty and many have succumbed to
rust. The shelves that aren't empty hold broken shards of glass. The archive
continues to the south, and an exit leads west.
91084: The shelves cover the room, as if they had multiplied in the same manner
Coke bottles in the fridge don't. They are covered in broken shards.
91184: The shelves seem to be for glass only.
91212: The glass fragments (perhaps broken bottles?) run the gamut from large
shards to fine, gritty powder.
91284: You would most surely cut yourself.
91312: The walkway runs along the east wall of the hallway. A sweeping
staircase joins the walkway to the southwest.
91388: An inner voice tells you there's no Coke that way.
91424: An inner voice tells you there's no Coke that way.
91460: The staircase curves as it falls to the floor below.
91496: The walkway is cut off to the south by the rising walls of the foyer.
There is a doorway to the east; the walkway continues to the north.
91620: curving around the end of the building. Shelves filled with books take
up much of the room; the rest is inhabited by stacks of books. A metal sentinel
guards the west exit; directly above it is a clock.
91764: They are stacked back to back in rows running around the room.
91808: The books resemble case histories from a law library: leather binding,
small type on their spines.
91876: You wouldn't know where to begin.
91984: ." You replace it and draw another: slightly different ingredients,
slightly different method of preparation. Each recipe seems vaguely familiar,
none seem quite right.
92104: A dark metal statue, reminiscent of a prop from Fritz Lang's Metropolis.
A stern, angular head sits atop a sexless body seven feet tall. One arm hangs
by its side -- the other extends outwards as if to grasp something.
92260: The statue's relaxed hand suddenly blurs into life. It reaches up to the
bottle, twists off the cap, and returns to the relaxed position almost before
you noticed it moving. You (gingerly!) take the bottle back.
92412: The statue's relaxed hand suddenly blurs into life. It reaches up to the
bottle and twists off the cap. Hidden taste sensors activate, and the sentinel
hurls the bottle to the ground, to shatter in a crash of glass and hissing
fluid.
92576: The statue's relaxed hand suddenly blurs into life. It reaches up to the
bottle, finds that it is already open, and returns to the relaxed state again,
almost before you have time to blink. You take the bottle back.
92728: in the statue's hand. Nothing happens. Eventually you remove it.
92776: The room is hot and stifling -- makes you wish for a Coke right about
now -- and cobwebs drip from every surface. A hot-water tank crouches in one
corner. Rickety stairs lead into the depths of the building. To the east is
92936: The stairs lead down.
92952: A cramped square room, barely lit by windows above you. The north and
west walls are taken up by tables. A clock is just visible next to the stairs
on the south wall. In the northwest corner is a tiny drain, while a pile of
bottles has claimed part of the east wall.
93136: The windows are barely ten centimeters tall and are nearly flush with
the ceiling. They are much thicker than you would expect, almost like the glass
found on submersibles.
93256: The metal drain is a small circle with a grate about ten centimeters in
diameter.
93312: A quiet sound catches your attention. A black liquid has begun welling
up through the drain, covering it and starting to fill the northwest
corner.

Frankie glances down, then swears quietly. "Sam, you son-of-a-bitch,"
he mutters, scribbling furiously in his notebook.
93508: The bottles are smooth and translucent, glowing softly from within.
Several are caked with mud and dirt, testimony to their recent location. They
have been stacked in a tight-fitting pyramid. You feel a strange sense of deja
vu as you gaze into them.
93684: Again you reach for the bottles, but cannot draw close. The rush of
memories triggered by the bottles was overwhelming the first time.
93778: You reach your hand towards one of the bottles. As you draw nearer, a
spark spits from the bottle, rushes up your arm, and then--

Darkness, then
light.

You see yourself, a brief memory of buying a Coke for the first time, a
muttered conversation, money changing hands, the hiss of a can opening, and
then the taste. Ahhh.

Light, then darkness.

You'd been in the principal's
office for hours. Got suspended for a week, you remember. But Billy Thimbleton
was in the hospital with a broken arm and a black eye. That'll teach him to
offer you a Dr. Pepper--

With a horrendous wrenching sensation you pull
yourself away from the pile of bottles. You glance at Frankie, but absorbed in
his work, he has not noticed your momentary distress.
94312: The tables line the north and west walls.
94344: Frankie is of middling height, with tousled hair and a sandy brown
mustache. He carries a notebook
94448: Frankie is here, sorting and mixing.
94476: A man stands bent over the tables, jotting things down in a large
notebook.

As your footsteps sound on the stairs, the man turns. He looks you
over, one eyebrow quirking in surprise. "Hello," he says. "And here I thought I
was the last one still around. I'm Frankie."
94676: "Excellent!" Frankie says, taking the bottle from you. He immediately
begins observing the Sprite and taking notes on its behavior. "By the way," he
says, "I don't need this, and you might find it handy." Frankie takes the
bottle opener out of his pocket and hands it to you.
94876: "Yes, yes", he says impatiently, "I told you, I can't get it open."
94932: "Dear God, what is this?" he says. "I've seen some weird things in my
day, kid, but nothing as weird as this. Take some advice from someone who's
been around and stick with Coke." He hands it back.
95080: "Hmm, this is empty," Frankie says, taking it. "I'm always looking for
samples, but this isn't much help." He hands it back.
95176: Frankie doesn't appear interested.
95204: As you prepare to attack Frankie, he turns and fixes you with a gimlet
glare. "Now, now," he says softly. "Getting antsy without a caffeine fix, eh?"
95316: Frankie grins sardonically. "I'm just an archaeologist, nothing more. My
team and I were working on unearthing those," he gestures at the pile of
bottles by the wall, "until we got word of the drink shortage."
95468: Frankie shrugs. "I'd never seen you before you walked down the stairs.
You look like you could use a Coke, though."
95552: Frankie says "I'm doing some observational analysis. I'd like to do some
product synthesis of these bottles once I figure them out."
95648: "Very interesting, this bottle is," says Frankie. "Although of course
it's not Coke."
95828: He hands you the bottle.
95848: "Top floor, I said. In the library."
95880: "I'm sure you can think of a use for it."
95912: "Tell you what. I can't seem to get this bottle open with this opener,
so if you get the bottle opened for me, I'll give you the opener. Top floor."
He hands you the bottle.
96040: "Excellent!" Frankie says, taking the bottle from you. He immediately
begins observing the Sprite and taking notes on its behavior. "Here you go." he
says. Frankie takes the bottle opener out of his pocket and hands it to you.
96204: "Top floor, I said. In the library."
96236: Frankie doesn't appear interested.
96264: It looks like an ordinary bottle-opener, made out of metal with a pointy
bit on one end.
96364: You struggle with the cap, but it's firmly shut.
96400: You think about it, but decide you'd really rather have a Coke.
96448: A small paper pyramid, about three centimeters on an edge.
96490: The pyramid begins glowing softly. It unfolds like a flower and voices
begin to issue from it, saying "Subject suffering from unusually low levels of
sugar and caffeine..."  "Thirst dangerously unsatisfied..." (someone shouts)
"Doctor! We must try the new experimental treatment, it's his only hope!"
"Fine, get me a syringe."
When the light dies down, the pyramid is gone.
96764: A section of the air just above your head shimmers. A small pyramid
falls from the disturbance to the ground below.
96848: You are in the room where your father died. It is crowded with familiar
medical equipment which clusters around a bed.
96932: The array of equipment only succeeded in prolonging your father's agony.
Tucked in amongst the equipment you notice a mini-fridge.
97024: The bed is bowed under your father's weight.
97056: He breathes in shallow gasps. His face is pale as a candle flame. The
cancer has crept from his lungs to the rest of his body.
97148: Your father lies on the bed, barely breathing.
97182: You lean over and tip some of the Coke into your father's mouth. His
eyes open in surprise for a minute, and then he slowly smiles. "You're --
You're a good boy, Terry."

*** Thanks to Coca-Cola, you have resolved your
latent Oedipus complex and gone on to a happier and more mentally and
physically secure life ***
97428: The minifridge is small but compact.
97456: Mmm. Coke. At last.
97476: You take a sip of the Coke. Truly, this entire experience was worth it.
You glance up again, and notice the prone figure of your father, lying there.
97584: The sludge is thick and black and bubbly. It dribbles in alarming
fashion, almost pulsating as it moves towards you. That's Pepsi, alright.
97684: The thick, viscous stuff surges towards you as you approach. Alarmed,
you back away.
97744: Surely you jest. It'd eat you alive!
97772: Hissing, the table legs begin to dissolve in the sludge. You hastily
step away.
97830: Almost all the available floorspace is taken up by Pepsi. Several of the
bottles in the pile have already been eaten away, their contents mixing with
the sludge. You step back to a narrow spot by the stairs.
97978: Finally giving up on his experiment, Frankie tries to jump over the
sludge to reach the stairs. Unfortunately, his leap falls short, and his foot
splashes down into the Pepsi. "Save yourself!" he calls, collapsing with a
scream into the bubbling liquid.
98162: Death by Pepsi. What a way to go.
98262: You cry out as the floor collapses, dropping you into a seething pool of
Pepsi-Cola.
98380: Where disappearing items go.
98400: A snappy night shirt of blue and white stripes.
98440: Why change the habit of a lifetime?
98468: But you are wearing your night shirt.
98494: You struggle, but clamber up successfully.
98528: You tumble down, but being a soft bear, that's ok.
98566: You struggle, but clamber up successfully.
98600: You tumble down, but being a soft bear, that's ok.
98638: When you aren't lying on the bed, you usually stay in here, snug and
safe with your friends atop the warm pile of clothes.

The cupboard opens
eastward to the bedroom.
98760: A neatly stacked pile of clothes intended for human beings.
98862: . Yummy.
98872: You can't get your soft toy paws under the ring pull to open the can.
98980: Your warm winter Coca-Cola jacket is here, which may be just as well,
it's a little chilly.
99052: Matt and Terry Moose refuse to participate in this cheap commercial
ripoff. However, please watch out for their upcoming game, Matt and Terry's
Interactive Magic Show, at an interactive fiction archive near you.
99204: Moonlight plays through the window, softly illuminating the bedroom,
full of comfortable memories.

To the west is the cupboard where you usually
live, and the doorway to the northwest leads to the rest of the house.
99416: A large bed for bears, but just right for people.
99452: It's tough to see into the cupboard from out here, the light isn't very
strong.
99508: It's too dark to see anything from here. Better to go inside.
99552: The cupboard door is just a bit too heavy for a small bear to budge.
99684: David continues to sleep, totally oblivious.
99716: David continues to sleep, totally oblivious.
99748: It's a funny thing, but teddy bears have always had a tough time making
themselves heard in the company of people.
99828: A touching gesture, although your owner remains asleep and unaware.
99876: David continues to sleep, totally oblivious.
100288: David continues to sleep, totally oblivious.
100320: A touching gesture, although your owner remains asleep and unaware.
100368: David, your owner, lies next to you on the bed, in a deep sleep.
100418: David lies on the bed, very much asleep.
101016: I'm not sure I understand your intention.
101048: How could you hurt such a lovely teddy bear?
101080: You are not the kind of toy that requires batteries.
101116: From deep within you hear a cute honking sound.
101152: That sounds like quite a feat. Try climbing.
101184: Wouldn't it be easier to walk there?
101212: Quite the most beautiful furry brown teddy bear. And a good potential
corporate logo to attract young children, not that the Coca-Cola Corporation
would ever do that. Anyway, we fund dentists' groups to prevent this sort of
accusation, buddy! So leave us alone.
101398: Your surroundings melt away, and you find yourself in a completely new
place!
101588: .


 And some nights, things somehow turn out for the best...
101758: -- Helen McKay, "The Lost Teddy"
101864: interactive fiction has languished in the ghetto of obscurity. Despite
brilliant and insightful works by dozens of new authors, IF has continually
failed to receive the recognition by the general community it so richly
deserves. The solution? Corporate sponsorship.
102052: The Coca-Cola Corporation, in conjunction with the newly-formed
Interactive Fiction Promotion Board (a wholly-owned subsidary of the Cola-Cola
Corporation), is pleased to announce a new direction in text adventures,
Interactive Fiction for the Next Millennium.
102346: Our promotion plans will take several forms. Television and radio
advertising, of course, will be a must. The marketing department is still
working out slogans, but we have a number that seem promising, including "Zork:
it's the choice of a new generation", "Just say 'No' to grues", and
"Perdition's Flames: Mostly Dead".
102588: The opportunity for product tie-ins are also unlimited. Imagine being
able to purchase an Elvish bottle-opener of great antiquity (glows blue in the
presence of caffeine!), or a black rod with a rusty star on one end and the
familiar red-and-white logo on the other. Or how about this: buy a six-pack of
Coke, and get a hintbook for Curses!
102832: And speaking of Curses, that brings us to the most important aspect of
the promotion -- IF development. Because that's what this is really all about,
right? With the help of the Coca-Cola Interactive Fiction Promotion Board
Foundation, full-time IF authorship is about to become a reality. Certain
selected authors will be chosen based on the quality of their work to receive
sponsored positions at the Foundation, with no other task than to continue
producing the sort of games they've become famous for. Needless to say, these
are expected to be highly-sought positions, but all members of the IF community
are encouraged to apply. As examples of the sort of thing we'll be looking for,
the Foundation has hired several current IF authors to rework parts of existing
games in the new "Coca-Cola style".
103406: We hope you enjoy the package, and invite you to submit a demo game of
your own ASAP!
103474: P.S. And remember -- when you see XYZZY, think Coke!
104216: The following people comprise the group:

Lucian Smith:  The main
module and library replacement.
Adam Thornton:  'Curses' module
J. Robinson
Wheeler:  'Adventure' module
Michael Fessler:  'Planetfall' module
Adam Cadre: 
'Hitchhiker's Guide' module
Dan Shiovitz:  'Losing Your Grip' module
David
Dyte:  'A Bear's Night Out' module


'Coca-Cola' and 'Coke' are registered
trademarks of the Coca-Cola bottling company.
104552: You have completed all the scenarios! You should celebrate, with a tall
glass of refreshing Coca-Cola!
104628: In this game, you haven't completed any of the scenarios yet.
104704: I'd like to teach the world to sing, I'd Like To Buy The World A Coke.
104760: Your surroundings twist into a red and white vortex, and you find
yourself back at the Coca-Cola dispenser.
104840: Sorry, you can't RETURN from this section of the game.
104884: Clearly you lack a musical background.
104912: Teddy bears, being soft toys, find such feats difficult.
104952: Obviously you lack a medical background.
