appropriately.
80824: Such self-absorption is unbecoming.
80852: Impossible. Your legs have no joints.
80880: The audience is making far too much noise to hear anything specific.
81324: Your faith moves the crowd, who all drop to their knees as well and pray
for salvation from Jesus Christ. The show of faith and brotherly love causes
you to weep openly. You embrace the red robot. "Let's go have a Bible study!"
you shout. The crowd roars its agreement.
81516: You play a MIDI of "Shave and a Haircut".
81552: You always make sure you're fully charged before a match.
81592: The red robot does not accept your apology.
81624: Real robots do not use such language.
81652: You analyze the situation, formulating plans of attack and carefully
considering any openings the red robot might give you. While you're doing this,
the red robot whacks you in the head.
81784: You are attached to the floor of the ring. There is no escape for you.
81836: A few dents and dings from the previous rounds mar your gleaming blue
exterior.
81890: The red robot parries your blow!
81916: You deal the final blow to the red robot, sending his head flying
upwards. You wouldn't think it possible if you couldn't hear it, but the crowd
begins to cheer even more loudly than before. The red robot's manager looks on
in horror, quickly jumping into the ring to push his client's head back into
place.

You're quickly ushered out of the arena and to safety as the fans begin
to mob the ring. You're taken to a waiting limo. Your manager is already
waiting inside, grinning broadly.

"Nice work, Blue. I had faith in you the
entire time." You try to thank him, but he's too excited to listen. "I just got
off the phone with a few contacts of mine -- y'know, in the breakfast gears
business and stuff -- and it's lookin' very good for you. I tell you, a match
this big, you'll be gettin' the biggest endorsement deal there ever was. We're
both going to be rich! Let's go out to celebrate!"
82554: As the red robot's fist connects with your face, you feel your head
begin to jerk upwards. You don't have long to feel sorry for yourself; you
black out shortly afterward.
82712: Property value not routine or string: "
82740: Entry in property list not routine or string: "

83124: You are standing in the ring of one of the greatest robot boxing
stadiums in the entire world. Thousands of screaming fans have packed the arena
to see your match. It's time for the fight to end it all.
83264: You are attached to the floor of the ring. There is no escape for you.
83316: The red robot is the reigning champ of robotic boxing. No one expected
you to hold your own against him, but you're no pushover; you've given him a
run for his money.
83436: The red robot stares at you intently.
83464: You have to wait for the match to start, or else you'll be disqualified.
83516: Those kinds of robot fights were outlawed years ago.
83552: You don't dig the red robot at all. He is your eternal foe.
83596: You point and shout, "Hey, look! Behind you! Something cool!"

It
doesn't work.
83660: You have to wait for the match to start, or else you'll be disqualified.
83712: Those sorts of moves are strictly prohibited.
83744: The red robot just looks at you. What a jerk!
83780: The red robot ignores you completely. How rude.
83816: He doesn't want it. Has he no respect for the power of croissant?
83864: this violence is senseless. Why can't blue robot and red robot coexist
in harmony?
83922: You reach out to embrace your red brother. Unfortunately, it appears he
does not share your pacifist views. While you're vulnerable, he pummels you
mercilessly.
84040: The audience is packed into every available seat in the stadium, with
plenty more sitting in the aisles. They're watching you intently, and making
quite a commotion.
84156: You'd better not. Your manager is still making payments on the loan he
had to take out to pay the settlement from the last time.
84248: You forgot to bring your flamethrower.
84276: You dig the audience members that cheer for you, anyway.
84316: Save it for after the match, Romeo.
84344: You give the audience a smile and a wave, to the excited cheers of your
fans. You imagine they'll all be telling their friends when they get home,
"Blue waved at
84460: You shout something to the audience, but they can't hear you over all
the racket in the stadium.
84528: You throw the croissant to a young lady in the audience. She is overcome
with joy and begins screaming to her friends about her new treasure.

Being
famous is awesome.
84648: You shouldn't have any other items to give. This is a bug.
84690: A little girl in the front row bellows with rage. "The robot requires
additional pummeling! Continue!"
84768: The crowd screams with pleasure.
84794: The audience roars with approval.
84822: A man in the audience yells, "Knock his block off, Red!"
84870: A woman seated behind you yells, "Go Blue! Kill that red bastard!"
84926: The crowd holds its breath in anticipation of your next moves.
84976: A warm, flaky croissant, engineered for tastiness. It was given to you
by a kindly French baker.
85048: How can you even think of doing such an injustice to this marvelous
croissant?!
85104: That is the duty of a lowly kitchen bot.
85132: You throw the croissant to the floor and stamp on it in disgust. You
barbarian!
85188: You throw the croissant to a young lady in the audience. She is overcome
with joy and begins screaming to her friends about her new treasure.

Being
famous is awesome.
85308: You are filled with the terrible power of French baked goods!
85352: It rings when the match starts. That's about all there is to it.
85398: The bell rings! The match has started!
85430: Four rounds have gone by. You and the red robot have remained neck and
neck for the lead, with two wins each. The robot that emerges victorious in the
fifth round will become Champion of Robotic Boxing, with all the praise and
adulation that title implies. 

Also, you get a pretty sweet endorsement deal
from a leading gear manufacturer. 

The final round is about to begin. Get out
there and win!
85820: Have you tried...

...praying?
...hugging the red robot?
...throwing the
match?
...cheating?
...thinking? ...magic word XYZZY?
86280: With a grin, you reach forward and press the red robot's OFF button. You
pummel him mercilessly until his head pops up. Your manager assured you that
the judges wouldn't be able to tell it from any old knockout, but he was wrong.
The judges quickly discover your foul play, and alert the authorities.
86492: Yeah, you'll get you someday. Bastard.
86522: You make only a token effort to defend yourself, allowing the red robot
to pop your head up. It may not be a glorious way to go, but it is profitable.
Your manager bet a ton of cash on the red robot, and you'll get your share of
it, fair and square. There's a nice sprocket you've had your eyes on for a
while, maybe a lube job.

On your way out of the stadium, you are stopped by a
small child. "Why'd you lose, Blue? You never lose like that. You can't have
lost like that."

Your ears burn with shame. "Shut up, kid!" you shout. You run
to your waiting limo, and seat yourself.
86944: I used to be a champ, and now I'm just trash.
86980: You bury your face in your hands and sob.
87012: It's said that that is a sign of mental illness.
87048: Oh, come now. Are you just entering silly, implausible commands to see
if I anticipated them? For shame, sir and/or madam!
87138: You close your eyes in deep concentration and intone the magical word
XYZZY...

You open your eyes and find yourself in a bakery in beautiful Paris!
The baker smiles at you and presses something into your palm.

"
87296: " the baker replies.

The spell wears off, and you find yourself back in
the boxing ring.
