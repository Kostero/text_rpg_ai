today ripples the surface and makes this a very tranquil area. Towards the

red on/off switch. You realize now, that the artificial woodgrain panels look a
little cheesy in an electric vehicle, but are glad that you spent the extra
money on the optional glovebox and the personalized license tags which read
"COWDOG-1".

them up and DROP items to put them down. You can also PUT items IN things or
GET items FROM others. Fairly complex sentences are possible, for example GET
THE HAMMER FROM THE TOOL BOX THEN HIT THE WINDOW WITH THE HAMMER is a valid
input (assuming that there happens to be a tool box with a hammer in it
nearby).
60718: You may encounter people or other creatures while exploring the world of
the game. You can ask these people questions by typing ASK person ABOUT topic
and tell them things by saying TELL person ABOUT topic. You can also SHOW them
things. You can ask them to do things with PERSON, COMMAND. For example, to ask
a character named Jack to get the keys type JACK, GET THE KEYS.
61080: ) To get a list of everything you are carrying type INVENTORY (or I).
Some other useful commands you can try are PUSH, SEARCH, SHAKE, THROW, RUB,
KICK, CLIMB or READ. A part of any text adventure is learning what words the
game knows "It's a Dogs Life" knows hundreds of common words (and a few not so
common and X-rated ones), so feel free to try anything.
61886: General Appearance

The general appearance is that of a sturdy, compact,
symmetrically-built working dog. With the ability and willingness to carry out
any task however arduous, its combination of substance, power, balance and hard
muscular condition to be such that must convey the impression of a great
agility, strength and endurance. Any tendency to grossness or weediness is a
serious fault.
62166: Characteristics

The utility purpose is assistance in the control of
cattle, in both wide open and confined areas. Ever alert, extremely
intelligent, watchful, courageous and trustworthy, with an implicit devotion to
duty, making it an ideal dog. Its loyalty and protective instincts make a
self-appointed guardian to the stockman, his herd, his property. Whilst
suspicious of strangers, must be amenable to handling in the show ring.
62474: Head

The head, in balance with other proportions of the dog, and in
keeping with its general conformation, is broad of skull, and only slightly
curved between the ears, flattening to a slight but definite stop. The cheeks
are muscular, but not coarse nor prominent, the underjaw is strong, deep and
well- developed. The foreface is broad and well filled in under the eye,
tapering gradually to a medium length, deep and powerful muzzle. The lips are
tight and clean. The nose is black irrespective of the color of the dog.
62844: Teeth

The teeth should be sound, strong, and regularly spaced, gripping
with a scissors-like action, the lower incisors close behind and just touching
the upper. Not to be undershot nor overshot.
62986: Eyes

The eyes should be oval shaped of medium size, neither prominent
nor sunken, and must express alertness and intelligence. A warning or
suspicious glint is characteristic. Eye color is dark brown.
63132: Ears

The ears should be of moderate size, preferably small rather than
large, broad at the base, muscular, pricked and moderately pointed (not spoon
nor bat eared). Set wide apart on the skull, inclined outwards, sensitive in
their use, and firmly erect when alert. The inside of the ear should be fairly
well furnished with hair.
63368: Neck

The neck is of exceptional strength, muscular, and of medium
length broadening to blend into the body and free from throatiness.
63466: Forequarters

The shoulders are broad of blade, sloping, muscular and
well angulated to the upper arm, and at the point of the withers should not be
too closely set. The forelegs have strong round bone, extending to the feet
without weakness at the pasterns. The forelegs should be perfectly straight
viewed from the front, but the pasterns should show a slight angle with the
forearm when regarded from the side.
63756: Hindquarters

The hindquarters are broad, strong and muscular. The rump
is rather long and sloping, thighs long, broad and well-developed, with
moderate turn to stifle. The hocks are strong and well let down. When viewed
from behind, the hind legs, from the hocks to the feet, are straight and placed
neither close nor too wide apart.
63994: Feet

The feet should be round and the toes short, strong, well-arched
and held together. The pads hard and deep, and the nails must be short and
strong.
64110: Body

The length of the body from the point of the breast bone, in a
straight line to the buttocks, is greater than the height at the withers, as 10
is to 9. The topline is level, back strong, with ribs well sprung and ribbed
back. (Not barrel ribbed.) The chest is deep and muscular, and moderately
broad, loins are broad, deep and muscular with deep flanks strongly coupled
between the fore and hindquarters.
64404: Tail

The set on of the tail is low, following the contours of the
sloping rump, and at rest should hang in a slight curve of a length to reach
approximately to the hock. During movement and/or excitement it may be raised,
but under no circumstances should any part of the tail be carried past a
vertical line drawn through the root.
64636: Coat

The weather resisting outer coat is moderately short, straight and
of medium texture, with short dense undercoat. Behind the quarters the coat is
longer, forming a mild breeching. The tail is furnished sufficiently to form a
good brush. The head, forelegs, hind legs from hock to ground, are coated with
short hair.
64864: Color (Blue)

The color should be blue or blue-mottled with or without
other markings. The permissible markings are black, blue or tan markings on the
head, evenly distributed for preference. The forelegs tan midway up the legs
and extending up the front to the breast and throat, with tan on jaws; the
hindquarters tan on inside of hind legs, and inside of thighs, showing down
from the front of the stifles and broadening out to the outside of the hind
legs from hock to toes. Tan undercoat is permissible on the body providing it
does not show through the blue outer coat. Black markings on the body are not
desirable.
65298: Color (Red Speckle)

The color should be a good even red speckle all
over including the undercoat (not white or cream) with or without darker red
markings on the head. Even head markings are desirable. Red markings on the
body are permissible but not desirable.
65488: Size

The desirable height at the withers to be within the following
dimensions: Dogs 18 to 20 inches. Bitches 17 to 19 inches. Dogs or bitches over
or under these specified sizes are undesirable.
65634: Movement

Soundness is of paramount importance. The action is true,
free, supple and tireless, the movement of the shoulders and forelegs with the
powerful thrust of the hindquarters, in unison. Capability of quick and sudden
movement is essential. Stiltiness, loaded or slack shoulders, straight shoulder
placement, weakness at elbows, pasterns or feet, straight stifles, cow or bow
hocks, must be regarded as serious faults.
