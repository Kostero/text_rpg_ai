29883: Removed.
29985: You lack the dexterity.
30063: Done.
30115: That can't contain things.
30140: Alas, it is closed.
30234: Done.
30277: That isn't in your possession.

32077: That's plainly inedible.
32111: Not bad.
32126: That was a rhetorical question.

34710: An exercise in Interactive Fiction. Written by Kyle Frownfelter.
34776: You can't go that way.
34824: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
34856: As good-looking as ever.
34884: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
34944: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
34988: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
35030: I didn't understand that sentence.

35172: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
35208: You excepted something not included anyway!
35240: You can only do that to something animate.
35272: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
35322: I didn't understand the way that finished.
35354: There are none at all available!
35378: Sorry, you can only have one item here.  Which one exactly?
35778: Please give one of the answers above.
35804: [You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
35840: [Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
35878: "Oops" can only correct a single word.
35906: Are you sure you want to restart?
35930: The game file has verified as intact.
35956: The game file did not verify properly, and may be corrupted (or you may
be running it on a very primitive interpreter which is unable properly to
perform the test).
36070: You're carrying too many things already.
36134: You can't put something on top of itself.
36164: You need to be holding it before you can put it into something else.
36212: You'll need to take it off first.
36236: You can't put something inside itself.
36292: That's not something you can enter.
36318: You can only get into something on the floor.
36350: But you aren't in anything at the moment.
36380: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
36418: is now in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gives long
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
36514: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).
36596: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
36720: You can't see inside, since it is closed.
36750: That doesn't seem to be something you can unlock.
36786: That doesn't seem to fit the lock.
36812: That doesn't seem to be something you can lock.
36846: That doesn't seem to fit the lock.
36872: That's not something you can switch.
36898: That's not something you can switch.
36924: That's not something you can open.
36950: That's not something you can close.
36976: This dangerous act would achieve little.
37004: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
37034: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
37066: Digging would achieve nothing here.
37092: Cutting that up would achieve little.
37118: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
37144: You would achieve nothing by this.
37168: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
37196: But there's no water here to carry.
37222: Real adventurers do not use such language.
37252: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
37280: There's not enough water to swim in.
37306: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
37334: No, you can't set that to anything.
37360: That would be less than courteous.
37384: Is that the best you can think of?
37408: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
37446: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
37478: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
37536: This is your revolver, fully loaded and ready for the job your about to
pull off.
37592: This is the corner of Zen street which runs to the north. Baluthar
street is to the south.
37656: Ignoring your mission, you walk onto Baluthar street and vanish from
sight.
37710: You are standing at the north end of the street, directly to the south
of Gordan's restaurant. You could go back south.
37794: Why? You need to find a better way to destroy Guss than that.
37838: A single lamp post stands here, eluminating the street.
37878: It's your normal lamp post, which stretches up to the roof of the
restaurant.
37932: You step back, and load the lamp post with lead. Nothing has changed
much, except...
37994: Shoot the lamp post without your gun? I don't think so!
38034: You've already done enough damige to the thing already.
38074: You already have done enough damige already. Anyway, how could you blast
the thing if you don't have your gun?
38152: You are clinging to the top of the lamp post, where the roof is only a
jump away. The only other option in directions is down.
38240: This is as far as the lamp post goes.
38266: You can't go that way.
38284: You can't go that way.
38302: You fly... So high in the sky... And... Too bad the ground was cement.
38358: Somebody stares at you from below as they pass into the restaurant.
38404: Somebody laughs as they observe your hands gripping the lamp post.
38450: A small child atempts to climb the lamp post twoards you, but only
succeeds in hurting his hands.
38518: Somebody screams, "what in the hell is that man doing up there? Call the
nassional guard!"
38584: You brace yourself, and swing up onto the roof.
38618: You are on the restaurant roof, where the only exit is jumping distense
to the lamp post, or through the small skylight down.
38704: You jump, grabbing the lamp post on your way.
38736: The skylight is open.
38752: The skylight is closed.
38770: You plummit several feet before landing on the floor of the restaurant.
No one seems to have noticed your arrival.
38850: Straining, you lift the skylight.
38874: This is the restaurant that Guss was supposed to have came for the
night. It is pretty normal, a counter in the front, a set of chairs and things
just beyond the counter, and the exit from the restaurant to the south.
39024: A smile splits your face as Guss's picture hits your eyes: he's standing
next to the counter, his back turned towards you.
39112: Through the crowd, you can't make out the skylight. You probably
wouldn't be able to reach it anyway.
39184: Your boss wanted you to kill Guss because he was trying to get your boss
in trouble for the Hansen murders. Boss did it anyway, however, so he could.
But if you pull the job off just right, Guss won't talk to anyone.
39338: Get something that can shoot bullets before atempting this.
39380: Pointing the gun at Guss's head, you pull the trigger. The restaurant
goes into a frenzy as Guss collapses to the floor, blood pouring from the wound
in his head. You are pushed blindly forward by tons of people trying to get
out, most of them shouting things like "he's got a gun!" and "where is he?"
Finally, you manage to get away and you disappear down a alley.

The next day,
you smile in pride when the top headline is, "Guss Forden shot and killed in
restaurant. No leads or clues found."
39732: Just shoot him and get it over with!
39758: You don't want to catch Guss's attention.
39790: Your looking for a job. 'Boss' as you know him as, picked you up one day
and asked you if you wanted one. It was about murder, and you were scared at
first, but when he offered you five hundred thousand bucks you told him you
would take the risk. The car stopped at about seven o'c, and you got out, the
gun's cold metal touching your hip. You began walking, thinking of what you are
about to do...
40074: The gun fires, but no damage seems to have been done.
