147388: You are dressed in a business casual outfit, perfectly nondescript and
nonoffensive. You feel run-down.
147456: You are dressed in a business casual outfit, perfectly nondescript and
nonoffensive. Your eyes are bloodshot and you feel run-down.
147540: You are dressed in a sharp business casual outfit. You feel excited and
ready to take on the challenges of the workday.
147612: You are dressed in a leather jerkin, which is both weathered and
comfortable.
147660: It's too big for you to carry right now.
147688: It's too heavy for you to carry right now.
147716: A sense of all-consuming despair has not yet conquered you.
147756: You don't seem to have an odor to you.
147780: It is dark. It has always been dark as far as you can remember. But as
for the time exactly? It is long after midnight with the day long in coming.
147864: You have no real sense of that; all that remains is a faint dreamlike
buoyancy that suggests that time is somehow not important here.
147952: Worn and prematurely aged, they seem otherwise nondescript.
147992: You notice a chain of briers around your ring finger on your left hand,
bruises in the shape of thereof. They ache faintly.
148060: You rub your hands together for warmth.
148084: You rub your hands together for warmth.
148108: The floor is tiled, dull, and scuffed.
148132: Scruffy, thin, and light brown, the carpet provides scant cushion
between you and the foundation.
148192: The carpet is firmly affixed to the foundation of the building.
148228: The floor is firmly affixed to the foundation of the building.
148264: It feels threadbare as though worn down from the trammel of many leaden
feet.
148308: The curious scent of dirt, overused chemical cleaners and the faint
tracery of lubrication agents repels you.
148372: Although you know the carpet is there, you cannot see it through the
sea of detritus.
148420: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
148440: Doing so makes you sneeze. You quickly stop.
148468: You find it dark, rich, loose soil.
148492: You don't see any use for the soil.
148516: It feels slightly cool to the touch, but seems otherwise unremarkable.
148560: It smells dank and you get the sense of abandoned earth here, as though
the world were reverting to a time without man, so far and so few between have
been travellers here.
148664: It is greyish coarse-grained sand.
148688: You inhale the faint scent of rain water.
148712: It feels alternately slick and rough.
148736: It smells like rotting vegetation.
148760: You find it dark, damp soil.
148780: You don't see any use for the soil.
148804: It feels moist and clumps together easily.
148832: It smells like rain water and dying vegetation.
148864: These are stairs of fading carpet with no connecting backboards; they
pause in space like a series of shelves and lead upwards.
148940: These are stairs of fading carpet with no connecting backboards; they
pause in space like a series of shelves and lead downwards.
149016: A set of wide, well-worn concrete stairs ascends, banking perpendicular
every ten feet in a square pattern. Cigarette stains and chips reveal their
age.
149112: A set of wide, well-worn concrete stairs descends, banking
perpendicular every ten feet in a square pattern. Cigarette stains and chips
reveal their age.
149208: A tightly winding, shaky, rusted spiral staircase descends into the
dark.
149252: A tightly winding, shaky, rusted spiral staircase ascends into shadow.
149296: You don't find the stairs terribly noteworthy.
149324: The wall is defined by outlines of electric blue light. It seems barely
real, somehow.
149380: You notice nothing unusual about the wall.
149404: Superhuman dexterity, unfortunately, you lack.
149436: The ceiling is defined by electric blue outlines. It seems barely real,
somehow.
149492: Besides the flickering fluorescent lights, you notice nothing unusual
about the ceiling.
149544: The wall is weathered black stone, nearly invisible in the night.
149584: Thin layers of synthetic material cover these hulking chest-high steel
walls.
149636: A long dark gully comprised of frigid water and sickly plants, its
oil-like surface is broken occasionally by momentary splashes or bubbles.
149724: Here, the earth parts, leaving preciptiously-sloping banks on either
side dotted with scraggly vegetation.
149788: Wiry branches and leaves from plants here and there.
149820: It is a long dark expanse of oil-like substance that curls murkily
between sickly plants. Its oil-like surface is broken occasionally by momentary
splashes or bubbles.
149928: The trees bend and sway, divulging no further clues under your
examination.
149972: Rusty and slender, the streetlight arcs up into the night to greet its
distant sickly-yellow orb of half-life.
150040: You clamber up the surprisingly-strong pole to catch an unusual view.
The light dances with the shadows cast by the forest beyond the ravine, in a
mural of twisted branches and patchwork light. The wind rustles and chills you,
swaying the streetlight precipitously. You do not find any secrets from this
view, but you do feel as though you are a greater part of the whole and yet
transcendent. You clamber back down, rubbing your hands together for warmth.
150300: The streetlight sways freakishly to and fro as you climb it and you
hurriedly scamper back down.
150360: It creaks and bends but does not break.
150388: From here, the fence seems to be comprised of fine links that would
halt any intruder.
150440: Constructed of interlocking chain links, it arches upward into the
night. At the top, the overhang angles inward at a forty-five degree angle,
ending with some nasty twisted pieces of metal.
150556: The fence begins further to the north.
150580: You climb up the fence, but cannot proceed past the overhang.
Disappointed, you climb back down.
150636: The fence rustles like manacles in the wind.
150664: Sullen, opaque things, they are coated so that those inside can see
out, but those outside cannot see in.
150728: The windows are too far away to examine more closely.
150760: These are always-on floodlights, rusted into their positions by years
of neglect. Strangely, not a one has burned out.
150832: As you feel around for the best way to hold the light, you notice that
your hand is sweating. Then the awful odor of burning leather reaches you; in
horror, you look down to see small flames bursting from the end of the glove.
Hurriedly, you pull back the glove and stamp the fire out.
150988: The lights are scalding hot to the touch. Surprised, you immediately
pull back your hand.
151040: The lights are scalding hot to the touch. Surprised, you immediately
pull back your hand.
151092: The sidewalk is eroded smooth, but otherwise nondescript.
151128: Sickly, pale blooms, they look as though they had tried to flourish in
poison soil. Their stems are spotted with cruel thorns.
151204: They have the floral and rotting scent of old flowers left upon graves.
151248: The glove prevents you from obtaining a solid grip.
151280: The thorns prevent you from obtaining a solid grip.
151312: You squeeze a flower; it takes you several moments to free the glove
from the thorns.
151364: The sharp and menacing thorns dissuade you.
151392: The grasses stir silently in the still night air and are rough to the
touch. Occasionally the wind blows through them and they whisper secretively.
151472: They whisper, "King Midas has donkey's ears."
151504: Withered, dry wheat-like grasses, they dance in mysterious pantomime.
151552: The wheat-like grasses make a faint susurrus.
151584: These computers are barely recognizable as computers. It appears that
someone has smashed the sides of each one, leaving the mangled remains as some
kind of gruesome testament to technological obsolescence.
151710: The computers are but shells of their former selves, unusable now.
151752: The dark river gurgles and curdles, frothing white in patches as it
hurdles on to its unknown destination.
151844: As the sphere touches the river waters, lightning arcs across the
surface from one end of the river to the other, as far as you can see.
Brilliant, painfully-bright light at once supercharges the air, light so bright
you can see it even through closed eyes and arms thrown up over your face. Then
it is twilight once more. You open your eyes cautiously and see the
softly-glowing sphere at your feet.
152064: You have thrown the sphere once into the dark waters and moving to
throw it again produces a squint in your eye and trembling in your fingers.
Reflexively, you lower your arm.
152164: You run your hands beneath the dark flowing waters, but come up
empty-handed.
152212: The river flows onwards, yielding no secrets to your gaze.
152248: The river's strong currents and jagged rocks make swimming perilous.
152292: It is a collection of shadow-waters with vague dreary things clawing
upwards at some distance beneath, their real distance distended by the rippling
waters.
152384: To the east, you hear the sounds of lapping water.
152412: You hear the waves lapping the shore, but the water sounds too thick,
like oil; and what would be silence between wave crashes is instead burpling,
slurping sounds.
152508: You hear only the sounds of the canoe and the paddle disturbing the
silent lake.
152552: As you enter the lake, the waters curl around you and the air becomes
suddenly thin. Dizzily, you stumble out from the lake, watching the waters
slowly grow still.
152648: You can imagine yourself slipping free of the canoe, into the dark,
freezing waters, swimming slowly until they become warm and your eyes shut in
the lapping water's seductive heroin song, but you resist.
152768: From here, you can only hear the lake's distant ruminations; it appears
indistinguishable from the night around you.
152860: As the sphere touches the lake waters, lightning arcs across the
surface from one end of the lake to the other, as far as you can see.
Brilliant, painfully-bright light at once supercharges the air, light so bright
you can see it even through closed eyes and arms thrown up over your face.
153020: You hear a terrible hissing cut short, and then it is twilight once
more.
153062: You open your eyes cautiously and find the softly-glowing sphere at
your feet.
153108: You have thrown the sphere once into the dark waters and moving to
throw it again produces a squint in your eye and trembling in your fingers.
Reflexively, you lower your arm.
153208: The lake appears motionless, but its waves lap the shoreline at odd
intervals, most often just as you turn way, so that you only see motion out of
the corner of your eye. Its visual movements are oddly out-of-synch with the
constant, disconcerting slurping sounds of the waters burbling over the
shoreline. The lake itself looks like a giant oil slick, casting distorted
reflections of the moon, and the stars only occasionally, as if the latter were
drowning in shadow, struggling to free themselves.
153496: Even a few hasty moments of sifting through the unusually cold and dark
waters fills you with panicky unease. Fortunately, you find nothing.
153576: The dense hedges are filled with twisting holly-like leaves.
153614: Tangled in the leaves and brambles, you discover a badge attached to a
thin, black cord. You slip it around your neck.
153688: You feel the glove more than the hedges.
153712: The twisting leaves feel almost sharp.
153736: The scent of hollies tingles your nose.
153760: The sharp leaves would most likely leave you with many cuts. You
withdraw your hand just thinking about it.
153824: This is a broad, high-backed and well-kept leather chair.
153860: This is a well-worn mid-back black chair.
153892: It lurks in the shadows, guiltily.
153916: You spin around in the chair giddily, for a moment's brief delight.
153956: The chair spins easily in place for a few moments.
153988: You move the chair easily about the room, being careful to return it to
its original, upright position.
154048: You smile. "Wouldn't that be funny?" you think. "Moving the chair to
another room and making the owner chase it down." Then you think just how
quickly it'd get back to you and you abandon the idea.
154168: Don Quixote visions aside, the chair poses no threat to you.
154206: You see a large company desk here.
154232: It is an ordinary company standard-issue desk, remarkable only in that
there is absolutely nothing on it. You surmise that someone is preparing to
leave for vacation, or perhaps for a longer period.
154352: A cheaply manufactured faux-wood desk, it is heavy and scratched with
many years of misuse.
154410: The clock on the wall has no hands and reads in an authoritative font,
"NOW".
154464: It is a half-spherical clock, bereft of hands. It seems to watch you
and you become unnerved looking at it.
154528: You find them to be insubstantial absences of light.
154560: They are human-sized, approximately the size of your own shoes. They
lead north.
154608: They are human-sized, approximately the size of your own shoes. They
lead west.
154656: A well-worn slab of asphalt, dual yellow center lines faded with age.
154704: It runs through the night north and south.
154728: The road ends to the south and heads back north.
154756: The road continues east and west.
154780: To the north, it joins the highway.
154804: It curves from the west to the northeast.
154828: It leads more than one direction.
154848: These are dual yellow center lines faded with age.
154880: A wide highway visited by speeding cars, full of sound, light, and
strangers; it begins out of sight and ends the very same.
154956: This is aged and rutted asphalt occasionally marked by potholes.
155000: It leads more than one direction.
155020: Rotting wood, the sign was once apparently sea-blue and white; now only
flecks and patches of color remain.
155088: Though it fills you with a kind of righteous adrenaline, your efforts
to destroy the sign result in little visible difference.
155164: The letters have weathered and some have been defaced, but you can
piece together the name MEDARIS.
155228: Rotted posts, these barely anchor the sign to the ground.
155260: You are already inside the building!
155284: You are already outside the building!
155308: Even metaphysically, that is quite impossible.
155340: They are as far away as eternity, dim and distant.
155372: It is a disfigured, pierced crescent shape.
155400: It is an anorexic crescent shape, a sliver of silver in the sky.
155440: The silvery dew lays like a fine mist over all.
155472: Beams of faint electric-blue light spectrally illuminate the room in a
flickering glow. You cannot determine their origin nor their end.
155552: Your hand passes right through it.
155572: Beams of faint electric-blue light spectrally illuminate the room in a
flickering glow. You cannot determine their origin nor their end.
155652: A flickering electric-blue light that traces the walls, floor, and
ceiling nearby. It flashes on and off occasionally as if interrupted somehow.
155740: Your hand passes right through it.
155760: A flickering electric-blue light that traces the walls, floor, and
ceiling. It flashes on and off occasionally as if interrupted somehow.
155844: Although still fluorescent lights, they seem cheerier somehow, and
bathe the room in light.
155900: They are occasionally flickering harsh lights mounted in the ceiling
above.
155944: They're far out of reach.
155960: It's a simple pop song, for the most part.
155986: You lose yourself in the music for a while.
156016: You lose yourself in the music for a while.
156040: Saplings sway in the wind while firmer older trees remain steadfast;
all sparkle with the life of summer greenery.
156112: Besides the wind rustling their branches, the trees make no sound.
156152: You see no reason to uproot the tree.
156176: The tree barely budges in response.
156200: You can't see any such thing.
156220: A thick rolling mist shrouds the surface of the lake and dampens
everything.
156264: It smells like rotting vegetable material.
156292: It is a painting of a lush tropical marshland with a singular palmetto
tree in the center. It uses a traditional oil-based technique.
156372: They depict idyllic marshes and fens, with birds soaring or swimming
pleasantly.
156424: You move a painting but discover nothing of interest. Disappointed, you
move it back.
156472: You move the painting quickly and see that beneath it is ordinary wall.
156516: You can see a pier far in the distance, on the opposite shore.
156552: A decrepit pier looms like a rotting galleon out of the night.
156588: It is across the lake.
156600: They are too far away to examine any further. Of course, getting close
to them would be quite dangerous.
156664: Doing so would most likely be fatal.
156688: These are sickly, rotting sallow strands of green.
156720: You see no use for the dying vegetation.
156744: They are bark-covered extensions of the trees.
156772: High in the sky, it casts down warmth.
156796: It is in the sky. You are not.
156812: You feel it warm against your skin and filled with the scents of nature
and the stuff of dreams.
156868: Layers upon layers of eroded rock tell an shifting tale of color and
texture, its meaning unknown. The cliffs ascend precipitously into the night.
156956: It is a dimly-glinting tunnel of steel, a large storm drain.
156996: Doing that while you are inside it would be a good trick indeed.
157036: A concave stretch of sand, it juts out into the river. It appears large
enough to land upon.
157092: You don't see any use for the clay.
157116: It feels slightly cool to the touch, but seems otherwise unremarkable.
157160: The scents of dirt and wild weeds freight the air, bringing to mind
images of summer and ballgames passed.
157220: A few feet from the road, the shoulder becomes a vertical cliff with a
breathtaking view.
157276: A narrow strip of road that quickly becomes earth.
157312: It feels like the road, more or less.
157336: The shoulder of the road isn't going anywhere.
157364: He points a gaunt finger at the photo on the desk.
157396: "A game I once played..." His voice drifts off in the consideration of
halcyon times.
157456: "A game I once played..." His voice drifts off in the consideration of
halcyon times.
157516: "Records. You already know what they are."
157548: "So I can see who's coming," he says, and then adds beneath his breath,
"Of course, she doesn't have a reflection." You cannot be sure that he is
jesting.
157648: "Reference materials," he says dismissively.
157680: He pauses for a moment and then says, "You must be careful, as I told
you. Be very careful. Careful. She may not approve."
157760: "A plaything for adults. But sometimes these things come in handy."
157804: "That's mine, son. Why don't you open it up?"
157836: "Why don't you drop it so's I can take a look at it?"
157876: "I've never seen anything quite like it," he says, amazement creeping
into his voice.
157936: "That's an unusual thing," he says, squinching up his eyes at it.
"Better hold on to it."
157996: His eyes haze over. "I remember a summer afternoon, impossibly long
ago, it seems."
158056: A moment of eerie lucidity comes over the inhabitant. He looks you
right in the eye. "Why, it's your engagement ring."
158128: "Rings are symbols of power. Wearing one binds you to greater things.
Besides that, they make an impact in a fight." He chortles.
158212: "I don't know nothin' about that book."
158244: The inhabitant muses, "By standing on the shoulders of giants..."
158288: "It is a gateway, but not all entrances respond. I left it for you."
158332: He says, "Silver..." rather softly.
158360: He says, "I do not know, but I keen to know."
158396: "A letter from the past," he says, wistfully.
158428: He says, "I buried it to remember. To forget. To close the door on what
I couldn't escape. Now it is time for me to move on, but not before I see it
one last time."
158536: "The beautiful people..." His voice trails off as though he had said
too much.
158592: He fingers it and smiles mysteriously.
158620: "You know all that I know of this."
158644: He gestures solemnly at the wooden door to the north of the row.
158680: "Probably where a haint lives, I figure."
158708: "Inside. Yes, inside, it is different. Fear the dark."
158748: "There are worse things that sad soldiers here, son -- things much
worse."
158796: "It is a meeting ground and a prison for lost souls."
158828: He looks around him, suddenly. "I have no earthly idea what this thing
is doing here. It's unnatural, though, I tell you the truth."
158908: He takes on the gate of a prisoner, shuffling slowly, trembling, and
avoiding your gaze. His wizened fingers ratchet the cube mirror back and forth.
159000: He spits. "There's all kind of evil around here."
159032: He waxes poetic. "It is the fresh, clear, scent of the forests and of
youth and early love."
159142: The game you are playing is a work of Interactive Fiction.  In
interactive fiction you play the main character of a story.  You type commands
which determine the actions of the character and the flow of the plot.  Some IF
games include graphics, but most do not: the imagery is provided courtesy of
your imagination.  On the other hand, there's a wide range of action available:
whereas in other games you may be restricted to shooting, movement, or
searching items you can click on with a mouse, IF allows you a wide range of
verbs.
159450: There are various kinds of IF in the world.  Some of them put more
emphasis on solving puzzles; some want to move you through a coherent plot of
some kind; some want to offer you something to explore.
159576: In games with a lot of challenging puzzles, you can expect to spend a
fair amount of time wandering around trying to figure out what you should do
next; this is part of the fun.  (If you like that sort of thing, anyway.) When
you start a game, you can usually get a sense fairly early on of what kind of
game it is and what the author expects you to do.  Read the opening text
carefully: it may tell you things about the character you are playing, your
goals within the game, and so on.
159858: If the game tells you to type ABOUT or INFO the first time you play,
you should always do so: this information may include special commands or other
material without which you won't be able to finish.  This is the game manual,
so don't ignore it.
160052: Space: Most IF games are set in a world made up of rooms without
internal division.  Movement between rooms is possible; movement within a room
does not always amount to anything.  >WALK OVER TO THE DESK is rarely a useful
sort of command.  On the other hand, if something is described as being high or
out of reach, it is sometimes relevant to stand on an object to increase your
height.  This kind of activity tends to be important only if prompted by the
game text.
160352: Containment: One thing that IF does tend to model thoroughly is
containment.  Is something in or on something else?  The game keeps track of
this, and many puzzles have to do with where things are -- in the player's
possession, lying on the floor of the room, on a table, in a box, etc.
160524: Types of Action: Most of the actions you can perform in the world of IF
are brief and specific.  >WALK WEST or >OPEN DOOR are likely to be provided. 
>TAKE A JOURNEY or >BUILD A TABLE are not.  Things like >GO TO THE HOTEL are on
the borderline: some games allow them, but most do not. In general, abstract,
multi-stage behavior usually has to be broken down in order for the game to
understand it.
160816: Other Characters: Other characters in IF games are sometimes rather
limited.  On the other hand, there are also games in which character
interaction is the main point of the game.  You should be able to get a feel
early on for the characters -- if they seem to respond to a lot of questions,
remember what they're told, move around on their own, etc., then they may be
fairly important.  If they have a lot of stock responses and don't seem fleshed
out, then they are most likely present either as local color or to provide the
solution to a specific puzzle or set of puzzles.  Characters in very
puzzle-oriented games often have to be bribed, threatened, or cajoled into
doing something that the player cannot do -- giving up a piece of information
or an object, reaching something high, allowing the player into a restricted
area, and so on.
161336: sign is where the game says, "Okay, what do you want to do now?"  You
may respond by typing an instruction -- usually an imperative verb, possibly
followed by prepositions and objects.  So, for instance, LOOK, LOOK AT FISH,
TAKE FISH.
161522: The first thing you want to do when starting a game is acquaint
yourself with your surroundings and get a sense of your goal.  To this end, you
should:
161658: Get an idea of what sort of place you're in.  Usually the description
will tell you two important things: where the exits from the room are, and what
the objects are that you can interact with.  Type LOOK if you want to see the
room description again.
161822: Individual descriptions of items can help you out.
161870: Information about your character may be important.
161924: Sometimes you'll be holding something important.
161964: Move from room to room, and check out every location available.
161998: Here is a list of the standard instructions in games like this. You
should be aware that the game you are playing may introduce some other verbs,
as well.  This list is just a place to start:
162114: The following commands control the game itself:
162148: Standard abbreviations are as follow:
162190: Repeat the previous command.
162256: See what's around you.
162298: In order to communicate with the game, you will need to enter
instructions beginning with imperative verbs -- as though you were giving
orders to someone else to carry out.  For instance, >CLOSE THE DOOR or >LOOK
UNDER THE RUG.
162462: You may use articles ("the" and "a"), but you do not need to.  >CLOSE
DOOR will also work for the game's purposes.
162570: At any given time, you are in a specific location, or room.  When you
go into a room, the game will print a description of what you can see there. 
This description will contain two vital kinds of information: things in the
room you can interact with or take, and a list of exits, or ways out.  If you
want to see the description again, you may just type LOOK.
163066: D.
163072: In some locations, IN and OUT will also be useful.
163120: Throughout the game there will be assorted objects that you can do
things with.  Most importantly, you may TAKE or GET items, and (when you are
tired of them) DROP them again.  INVENTORY (abbreviated I) will list the items
you are currently holding.
163284: There are usually assorted things you may do with these objects. OPEN,
CLOSE, WEAR, EAT, LOCK, and UNLOCK are especially common.
163380: Occasionally, you will find that the game does not recognize the name
of an object even though it has been described as being in the room with you. 
If this is the case, the object is just there for scenery, and you may assume
that you do not need to interact with it.
163554: There are a few simple commands for controlling the function of the
game itself.  These are:
163802: -- Saves a transcript of the game as you're playing it. Useful for bug
reports and bragging rights.
164118: A dream more real than your reality...
164208: Reality? Do you remember? Only gauzy dreams of black crepe mist.
164312: The building is here. It holds secrets. It holds your secrets.
164534: WHAT'S NEW AND DIFFERENT ABOUT BUILDING?
164588: Building uses a different scoring system than other IF games. It tracks
experience and certainty. Experience is a raw accumulation of points for
figuring out various puzzles, gaining entrance to new areas, and so forth.
Certainty measures your surety of what has happened to you and who you are.
164774: Building uses many different synonyms for verbs and nouns, so you
shouldn't be stuck playing the guessing game. New verbs and notes about verb
usage are listed below, with optional words in parentheses.
164902: New verbs: REMEMBER, SWIPE, SLIDE, REACH (IN), TURNS, LAND, ROW, and
PADDLE, REFLECT, SALUTE, WAVE (AT).
165022: Usage: UP and DOWN are movement commands only. SIT (DOWN) and STAND
(UP) change your posture. SHOW requires a physical object.
165126: If you are in a situation that would ordinarily prevent you from
moving, and you type a direction, you'll automatically take care of that
situation and then move. This applies ONLY to your movement. For example:
165254: You are now wearing the chain attached to the fence.
165288: The dry marsh around you extends as far as the eye can see.
165322: ROW and PADDLE require an object and a direction. Example:
165370: Charon scowls, but he goes along for the ride. 
You are now nearly
across the river Styx.
165430: Many things happen only once, so be on the lookout. The denizens in the
game will usually tell you something once or on their own timetables. Repeating
commands may not always produce the same result every time. You cannot use "Get
(or Take) all".
165878: orror movies, Dark Shadows, and Twin Peaks also cast their shadows over
this work. Finally, one of the scenes was inspired by an episode of Monk.
165970: Content-wise, I believe that all created works are at least emissaries
of information; they last depending on the timelessness of what they speak
about. That is why people will be talking about Braveheart long after Mel
Gibson has passed on. My works also point to greater things because I must
express the bleeding, beautiful truth that lives within me. So if you detect
elements of mysticism, theology, philosophy (specifically with a Christian
bent), you're not imagining things.
166276: As for IF games, I draw influences from the Lurking Horror, Babel, and
Zork I. I've never played a game with this kind of atmosphere, but I'm sure
there are ones like it out there. I'd just never found them.
166416: There's a lot of people to thank for this game, many of whom are
unaware that they've helped me to create it. Many contributions were an ashes
for beauty kind of contribution: things intended for ill were transformed into
good.
166802: R.G.I.F (especially Samwyse, Roger Firth and Zarf -- thanks for all the
answers!), Mom, Dad, all those who care about quality in the workplace,
Despair.com, and my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
166938: Building is (C) Intaligo Productions, 2005-2006.
167052: The following are the terms of use for this product. These constitute
your license.
167238: A voice says, "There is a passage back to life."
167274: A voice whispers, "Situational grace for self-made thorns."
167320: You hear words from far away, "The ending is the beginning."
167358: A voice says, "In the world, not of the world."
167394: Words come to you on the wind, "Trials are the crucible, but what is
produced? Dross or diamond?"
167460: The pier creaks beneath your feet as if in longsuffering protest.
167500: The pier groans and shifts in a chilly, clammy wind from the lake.
167538: The air around you feels strangely cold.
167566: You sense the presence of someone else; you turn around and look
everywhere, but you find nothing and yet the feeling does not leave you.
167648: A spectral figure forlornly patrols the hallway. He wears a ragtag
uniform and has a musket slung over his shoulder.
167720: Out of the corner of your eye, you catch a flicker of motion. An
incorporeal figure passes from chair to chair. You blink. The spiderwebs shimmy
and sway and the figure becomes once again just the arrangement of spider-silk
and sphere light.
167860: The stands creak forlornly in the wind.
167884: Groaning, the stands sway and heave.
167914: You hear the sound of many mechanized joints firing and compressing as
if a gathering of pistons. They seem to be closing in on you.
168046: Other voices assail you from all around. 'What made you think you could
come back?' 'You can never be free.' 'You will be like us, imprisoned spirits.'
The voices are like cassette tapes, playing at first too slow and then too
fast, in a cacophonous disharmony.
168208: You can go only east, south, and in.
168282: at two glass doors, polarized and tinctured ochre by age. The
building's surface blends into the night effortlessly, and the doors reflect
any light that crosses them, lending the entranceway a mist of decrepit, regal
invincibility.
168422: at a gaping doorway that seems to suck the light inside. Two glass
doors have swung inward, brittle and now motionless.
168492: Rusted but impregnable frames wreathe the doors.
168524: A sleek, black brick is mounted flush to the wall. A thin, narrow
indentation bisects it left to right.
168588: It is a plastic, brick-shaped reader of some sort, judging by its
indentation.
168636: Sliding the black badge through the reader causes the reader to flash a
faint, faint green. The opaque glass doors fold open and inwards, and the odor
of musty carpets, dust, and subtle oppression invades you.
168756: It is a narrow indentation in the reader.
168780: The opaque glass doors are opened wide, pinned to the side of the
building like stilled specimens.
168836: The opaque glass doors are closed.
168856: The opaque glass doors are opened wide, pinned to the side of the
building like stilled specimens.
168912: Two glass doors, polarized and tinctured ochre by age. Surrounded by
steel frames, plexiglass-strong, they bar entrance to the building.
168998: As you pull on the handles, you hear a faint buzzing sound in response
to your attempts. The doors remain closed, mockingly.
169072: The doors remain open, stubbornly resisting your efforts.
169108: The doors do not yield to your efforts.
169132: You can neither lock nor unlock these doors.
169156: There is no sidewalk here, although you can see bits of concrete sewn
in the earth as remnants. A faint trail leads through the calf-high grass to
the south and west. The fence continues here, leaving less than five feet
between the building and its mesh clutches.
169308: These are tiny slivers of concrete wedged in the earth, too numerous to
count.
169356: A faint trail leads south and west through the calf-high grasses.
169396: Walking along the side of the building, you notice its impressive
facade genuflecting to the weathering of time; here, the dark marble is cracked
with rivulets of empty space, and the few sullen windows that appear are
tormented with scratches by occasional, dying flowers. There are no hedges
here, and only empty space with the illusion of motion (a stark absence
captured best in black-and-white photography) leads north and south. A fence of
chain links parallels the building, thrusting twisted metal barbs up into the
night like a bony fingers.
169716: The marble wall has split asunder in many places, leaving hairline
cracks and empty spaces.
169772: You have reached the eastern corner of the building. There are no
windows along the bottom floor and the walls are obscured by thick, malevolent
hedges. The floodlights are fewer here and somewhat dimmer as though the
presentation from the corners was not nearly as important as from the front.
The building stretches away into darkness to the north, where a wire mesh fence
accompanies it. To the east, you hear the sounds of rippling water and you can
barely distinguish the black lake from the night around you. The cicadas hum
lowly in sudden symphonies punctuated by measures of unsettling silence.
170104: You notice something in the hedges.
170128: You cannot see them. You can hear them. You know they are there.
170164: The cicadas hum in a low-pitched scratchy symphony of slow madness.
170208: The cicadas are uncannily silent.
170228: Attached to a thin black cord, this is a corporate badge, with the
usual off-white coloration and magnetic strip along the bottom. The name and
face upon the badge have been weathered into oblivion.
170348: The badge has been so weathered that you cannot tell whose it once was.
Even the name of the company has been eroded by time.
170424: A non-descript part of the badge.
170444: Eroded by time, it is now inscrutable.
170472: This too has been weathered into oblivion.
170500: You can only go north, south, and in.
170524: Here, the sidewalk ends at double-glass doors, surrounded by hedges.
The floodlights crouched near the building wall spew harsh fluorescent light
upwards, making the doors nearly translucent. The wind sighs, rustling the
hedges, and their shadows flicker in menacing serpent-shaped dances.
170696: Irregular patterns of flashing red light, nearly blinding. They emnate
from the reader.
170748: Your hand passes right through them.
170768: The yellowed glass doors are slightly ajar.
170796: The yellowed glass doors are closed.
170820: The doors are made of glass framed by steel and have yellowed to the
color of jaundice with age. Inside, the glass is caked with dirt, giving the
doors a gritty appearance.
170924: Looking through the doors, you see a world colored in jaundice. Sickly
yellowed piles of paper and wrecked parts lie all over the floor, and on the
far end stands a massive barrier, as if a madman had purposefully blocked
someone into the room.
171068: As you attempt to move the doors, a faint buzz greets you, the doors
remaining immobile.
171120: The doors swing loosely back and forth, remaining slightly ajar.
171160: The doors do not yield to your efforts.
171184: You can neither lock nor unlock these doors.
171208: The coda to a madman's symphony, this room provides a breathtaking
panorama of destruction. Spilling out of the room and under your feet, licking
at the doors is a sea of paper. Some papers are ripped from books; others are
printouts; others are handwritten notices in a frenzied hand, almost impossible
to read. The papers are clumped together by seemingly-random blotches of blood,
but as you step back it takes the uncanny appearance of a phoenix, each strand
of paper like a feather from the bird.

Shelves are torn down, their contents
making mounds of disheveled books like burial mounds, the shelves crossed over
the top like stone markers. Walls stand shredded, wallpaper flayed off in
large, sagging strips like skin stripped from a carcass. And hanging from
above, like some gruesome funeral rite, are mechanical joints and pistons and
camshafts. Looking at them more closely, you note that they are each
human-sized; each twisting and turning in the night air at bizarre angles; each
rusted with a deep-brown rust. And over the papers and between the burial
mounds, the floor is covered with unknown remnants, smashed into oblivion. You
wade through an ankle-deep sea of silicon and glass, steel and plastic. 

In
the center of the room sits a skeleton, perched macabrely on a throne of
debris, a book clutched in his bony fingers. You notice that he is missing many
bones, although no-one seems to have preceded you here. Behind him, lies his
throne room wall, a barrier obviously built from the inside, comprised of
mostly sheetrock, but also legs from chairs, book spines, computers, and human
hair. As the parts clash together like a horrible dissonant wind chime, you
notice the capstone to the whole opus: letters spray-painted upon the barricade
as if arching over a gate read, 'Work Will Make You Free.'
172294: Faded and yellowed with time, they trace the maddening of a soul and
the final days of the building. Though he never names himself, you deduce that
he was one of the best programmers in the company; his perspective begins
logically and ends up seething with bitterness and explosive invective. 

The
problems were easily remedied at the beginning; a hospital treatment or a nice
severance package, or if that did not work, then the dark agents were put to
work, making sure the person could not find work in the local area.  It was all
kept well under wraps. Later, the problems metasized far beyond control. The
implants failed and destructive hordes of half-men half-machine laid waste to
the building; murders and suicides occurred with a frightening frequency and
madness reigned. On an otherwise beautiful Tuesday morning, the police in
cooperation with the FBI, appeared and quarantined the place. Everyone left
they sent for debriefing and examination, and at least several executives they
led away in chains. Though they condemned the building later, its destruction
never quite happened. And him, they left him, because he was unrecoverable.
172992: Quotes and pages from industrial design manuals and labor theory books.
173036: These are collapsed splinters of wood and steel, arranged in primitive
structures.
173088: Sagging and rotted, it stinks like wound bandages.
173120: The barricade yields up nothing to your analysis; it remains a fearful,
artistic, awful statement of separation and slow madness.
173200: The old hardcover book seems quite fragile.
173232: Missing several bones, the skeleton clutches the book with one arm and
seems to smile ironically and tragically.
173304: Long and short shafts and gears dangle from the ceiling. You notice
that the rust is far too red to be rust alone.
173368: Obliterated parts lie strewn as if randomly across the room. You cannot
discern what they once were, so wrecked are they.
173440: The throne is composed of interlocking gears and shafts in a sadistic
design.
173488: The mounds whisper of the futility of man's knowledge, with books
treated as common as earth, as if fit only to shroud the knowledgable.
173600: It is an early work on labor theory, positing that workers must be cogs
to ensure the highest efficiency.
173664: You think of it and decide that the least you could do was to leave the
skeleton upon his throne, as a way of honoring his dying wish.
173740: You feel an overwhelming sense of devastation and loss here and you
cannot bear to disturb this awful scene.
173804: Hung from the ceiling along with the parts is a simple silver key.
173840: This is a short, stubby silver key, rather common looking.
173876: A sleek, black brick is mounted flush to the wall. A thin, narrow
indentation bisects it left to right.
173940: It is a plastic, brick-like reader of some sort, judging by its
indentation.
173986: Sliding the black badge through the reader causes the reader to flash a
faint, faint green. Before you, the opaque glass doors separate slightly, and
the night air rushes greedily in.
174092: A sleek, black brick is mounted flush to the wall, blinking red. A
narrow indentation bisects it left to right.
174160: It is a plastic, brick-shaped reader of some sort, judging by its
indentation. The reader flashes red irregular patterns that nearly blind you at
this close range.
174260: Sliding the black badge through the card reader causes the reader to
stop flashing for a moment. The doors rattle momentarily but then the reader
resumes its irregular flashing patterns.
174366: The building rises before you, a hulking shadow, blocking out the stars
above and disfiguring the moon. Windows upon windows pit its smooth obsidian
surface, glinting like tiny gasoline-colored eyes. A garrulous display of
floodlights spray up from the ground floor like failed fireworks, casting
writhing shadows from the dense bushes that ring the building except where the
sidewalk splits them asunder. The slate sidewalk continues from the building,
between the hedges to end at your feet, eroded smooth.
174662: [For information about this game, type 'info' or 'help' at any time. 
If you're new to interactive fiction, please do this first! ]
174754: As you step into the building, the scent of mold and dust reminds you
distantly of some hint, some clue, some half-remembered dream; as you pursue
it, it melts, leaving you with that eerie feeling of familiarity anew. The
fluorescent lights flicker to life, humming and buzzing from decrepit bulbs,
casting dying rays over an area long lost to disuse.
174964: You find the scent of mold and dust entwined oddly familiar.
175000: You realize that if you leave, you'll never reach the top. "Time is
money; money is time," the watch seems to say in its constant ticking.
175088: A long-forgotten side lobby of the building opens before you. Its
singular feature is its stark emptiness; the usual L-shaped desk, motivational
posters, humdrum potted plants and ordinary bric-a-brac characteristic of a
welcome desk have long since been removed. Were it not for the old dust and the
scent of long years and many travellers, it would have the unfinished appeal of
a house under construction. Instead, it is the entranceway to a temple of
decay. Stairs lead up to another floor, and a hallway ventures south.
175404: You can go only north, down, and west.
175426: Before you stretches an endless row of cubicles, each the same in every
detail. Each one has three walls that rise just high enough to block the view,
but not high enough to block sound. Each has two shattered chairs matted in
dust; each has a broken computer, turned off with a shattered monitor; each has
the same empty drawers and the same faux-wood desk. You are numbed and nearly
bedazed by the same theme repeated endlessly. It is like you are looking down a
production line for the soulless, or perhaps a type of graveyard. Footprints
lead north between the cubes.
175768: You listen carefully for quite some time. What you had thought was
merely the hum of the screen are in fact whispers, barely audible. You close
your eyes to concentrate and finally make out the words, "Behold what you may
never have."
175908: Mounted into the wall near the stairs is a screen the color of smoky
topaz.
175952: Mounted into the wall near the stairs is a screen displaying an endless
parade of beautiful people.
176012: Mounted into the wall near the stairs is a shattered screen.
176048: Looking closer, you see that the figures' lips move silently and their
eyes radiate disdain.
176104: The screen is shattered, fracture lines radiating out from a large
hole.
176148: You touch the broken screen. Amazingly, you avoid cutting yourself on
the sharp glass fragments.
176204: The screen instantly changes from a smoky topaz to what looks like an
otherworldly parade. An ever-changing procession of beautiful men and women
flickers across the screen in stunning detail. They never look towards the
screen, however.
176344: What appears to be a smirk crosses the lips of those directly before
your eyes, but nothing else happens.
176408: Visions of bloody broken glass and festering infections dissuade you
from this.
176514: in a deadly arc, instantly shattering the screen. It collapses inwards,
in a sickening collage of spaztical dying images and sounds of breaking glass.
There is now a large hole in the screen at the point of impact.
176640: The screen has already been demolished.
176666: with deadly force, instantly shattering the screen. It collapses
inwards, in a sickening collage of spaztical dying images and sounds of
breaking glass. There is now a large hole in the screen at the point of impact.
176796: The screen has already been demolished.
176824: You peer through the hole, but all that greets you is inky darkness.
You cannot tell if there is anything inside or not.
176892: You reach in the hole and feel around carefully. Your fingers fall
across a rounded object which you pull back from behind the screen and then
carefully forward. It is a sphere with a gold color, that of faded sunlight. In
your hands it feels slightly buoyant and it radiates enough light to see the
entire room.
177064: You reach into the hole and feel around carefully. You find nothing
further.
177108: It is located in the center of the screen.
177128: You take a look at the broken screen and quickly surmise that storing
things in the hole would not be worth the repeated risk of injured digits.
177208: You reach in the hole and feel around carefully. Your fingers fall
across a rounded object which you pull back from behind the screen and then
carefully forward. It is a sphere with a gold color, that of faded sunlight. In
your hands it feels slightly buoyant and it radiates enough light to see the
entire room.
177380: You reach in the hole and feel around carefully, but discover nothing.
177420: You peer through the hole, but all that greets you is inky darkness.
You cannot tell if there is anything inside or not.
177488: These things are barely recognizable as chairs, a conglomeration of
rusted metal bars and pads with the stuffing ripped from them.
177564: One look at the twisted metal and ripped seats and you reconsider.
177604: One look at the twisted metal and ripped seats and you reconsider.
177644: The drawers are made of plastic and sit comfortably in a vertical row
as part of the faux-wood desk.
177704: You pull the drawer out, revealing dust. You push the drawer in, hiding
dust. You push; you pull; the fun never stops.
177778: The side door is shut firmly.
177796: It is an standard-grade company door, made of an shiny wood-like
substance and barely thick enough to muffle noise. Jagged silver detritus
protrudes from the lock, the remains of a key.
177908: It is an standard-grade company door, made of an shiny wood-like
substance and barely thick enough to muffle noise.
177976: The door no longer shuts; with the key broken off in the knob, it can't
latch closed.
178024: You jam the silver key into the knob of the door, and twist. The key
breaks off in the lock, and almost petulantly, the door creaks open, revealing
a tiny, musty room beyond.
178124: The crowbar slips and the door remains locked.
178152: You turn the knob halfway and discover that the door is locked.
178188: A musty oppressive room welcomes you into its moldy embrace; beige
walls that ascend to unnecessary heights, darkening as they rise, make the
seven foot by seven foot area seem even more compressed. An off-white table
marked by deep cuts glowers in the shadows.
178348: It is an off-white table with inch-thick cuts at bizarre angles carved
into its surface.
178404: You can go only north, south, and west.
178428: You have reached the end of the row. Here, the cubicles stop as if out
of ennui, the designer amputated his vision for a world full of cubicles and
their denizens. Before you stands an oaken door with only the outline of a
nameplate left to state the grandeur of its occupant. It is shrouded with
various newspaper articles. To the west, the footprints end at a cube that
looks as if it was still occupied.
178664: leans out of the cube as you walk by and whispers, "Be careful."
178708: A rectangular sepia outline with the iridescence of a water stain is
all that remains.
178760: Though most have faded into illegibility, one or two remain readable.
These provide nonsensical analyses, consisting mostly of name-calling screeds
against various political figures.
178876: You begin reading them but their combined hysterics and mindlessness
quickly repel you.
178932: They smell like old newspaper articles.
178960: They are so fragile that doing so would cause them to crumble into
dust.
179004: The oaken door is slightly ajar, teetering precipitously on its hinges.
179048: The oaken door stands here, firmly shut.
179072: It is an imposing oaken door with articles covering it.
179104: The door appears to shut and then slips mysteriously free.
179140: The door creaks open, revealing a foreboding room beyond.
179172: The door does not yield to your efforts.
179196: The oaken door closes shut behind you.
179220: The watch burns like fire around your wrist and you can't seem to move
another step.
179268: You find yourself in a brooding, brutish little room, that seems as if
it would collapse upon you out of spite. Before you is a large bay window,
gasoline toned and littered with faint scratches, as though some wild animal
were attempting escape.
179412: You have the feeling that someone is watching you; the hairs on the
back of your neck rise in prickling unease.
179480: Before you is a large bay window, gasoline toned and littered with
faint scratches. Through it, you can see the parking lot below.
179556: Through the gasoline-colored window, the parking lot below unfolds in
all of its ruined glory; dying trees locked up in medians whisper to one
another as the streetlights sway, spreading their sick yellow light like some
plague; the wind scatters bits of debris in the wind, fruitlessly. The bleak
panorama distills in you a sense of tragedy.
179760: Typical of the modern office, the window is designed to be neither
opened nor shut.
179808: The window gallantly resists your efforts. Apparently it is made of
sterner stuff than it appears to be.
179872: Shallow scratches that connote madness rather than determination mar
the surface.
179920: An omnium-gatherum of a single life, as though years of life contents
were accumulated in one fifteen by fifteen foot space, so you find this room.
An L-shaped desk is mounted into the cube itself, supporting a
strangely-decorate computer. Though the screen is shattered and tilted a few
degrees sickeningly askew, it sports a rear-view mirror and various stickers
now obscured with age. Most indicate conventions attended, with each year
represented by a new sticker. Two broken keyboards gather dust beside the
computer, fluorescent highlighters and mechanical pencils lurking beneath their
keyed ridges. Up above are open rollcage cabinets, thrown bare to reveal their
contents to the world. Books lean upon books, names spilling down their spines,
interrupted with bizarre knickknacks. A plastic penguin peers out from among
the literary forest; an imitation bronze batting trophy stands in a moment of
frozen heroic glory; a picture stand frames a faded picture of a beautiful
brunette woman. And the papers, the towering collections of once-important
papers, are everywhere, like some kind of epidemic. On the pinpricked walls
hang only a dingy whiteboard which reads, "The day after tomorrow" and a
calendar marked with depressing realizations of corporate life.
180692: The inhabitant looks away and slowly shuffles back to his own
activities.
180736: The inhabitant sighs and looks around as if he had returned from a
sojourn to another world.
180788: The inhabitant looks you square in the eyes and takes a deep breath. At
last, he speaks, his voice heavy and yet freighted with strength, knighted with
purpose. "Now you know all that I know and more than that, you have overcome. I
can see that my hope was not in vain. So then, one final velleity, before all
things become as they must. Shake my hand."
181006: The inhabitant sniffs the air. "Can you smell it?" he asks, bedazedly.
"The scent of perfume."
181072: The inhabitant looks at the letter you are holding with keen interest.
He asks to see it.
181126: The inhabitant looks at you carefully and whispers nervously, "Let the
pages fly free."
181184: The inhabitant breathes a sigh of relief. "So then, you have discovered
the secret of beauty."
181244: The inhabitant looks up at you and the slight glow emitting from your
backpack. You cannot tell if he cracks a grin or not, but the shadows in his
cowl seem to glimmer nonetheless. "A light cannot be hidden under a bushel," he
murmurs.
181382: The inhabitant nods at you sagely.
181406: The inhabitant says, "I see that you know more, now."
181446: The inhabitant says darkly, "The beautiful people must be destroyed."
181548: "I saw silver hope surrounded by destruction," he murmurs.
181588: "I don't like the dark," he adds.
181652: He opines, "Set something that you love free. If it returns to you, it
was meant to be. If it does not, it was never truly yours."
181768: waiting for you. He looks at you steadily.
181832: gazing listlessly out of the cube. His eyes meet yours in weary ennui.
181938: He is waiting for you, the wizened man draped in a voluminous cloak the
color of rainy days and smudged with dust. His creaky office chair holds him as
though he were a king. And perhaps he is. His bony askew fingers clutch chair
arms, but relax upon seeing you; the cowl hides his features except for
brilliant blue-grey eyes, only slightly clouded with age. After surveying you
for several moments, he stands and speaks. His voice is heavy with suffering, a
gravelly voice.
182236: "I knew you would come. Only when, I did not know. You seem to have
taken too long, and yet, you could not have come before now." He closes his
eyes for a moment as his voice trails off, in thought. "But those matters, time
itself even, is for elsewhen. You have much to find and find again before you
leave."
182428: "As for me, call me the inhabitant," he says with a wry, weathered
grin. "For this is my kingdom," he adds, sweeping his arm wide across the cube,
"and this is my demise."
182540: A grey flowing cloak obscures all of the man except for his fingers,
withered and gaunt, and the faintest outlines of his face. He seems familiar,
but you cannot determine exactly why. His blue-grey eyes pierce you.
182668: He spins and catches the ball, unnaturally quickly. He hands it back to
you.
182716: The ball hits him square in the torso. As it rolls away, he turns to
you with slightly-sad eyes.
182774: He closes his eyes and smiles as though he had not smiled in decades.
Before you can breathe or speak, he turns to dust, a dust so fine that it
dissipates before reaching the floor. Then you realize just how old you must
be, and you trace in some small way the arc of this struggle. And his smile --
oddly peaceful and yet triumphant -- refuses to fade from your mind.
182998: He draws away and then looks up at you with an anguished gaze. His
words are just a whisper: "Not yet."
183072: He looks at you rather curiously and slowly mimics your salute.
183112: The inhabitant is engrossed and doesn't notice you.
183144: The inhabitant studiously ignores you.
183168: He starts to answer and then thinks better of it. He replies instead,
"That is for you to discover."
183232: He smiles. "Oh, that's not important."
183264: He begs off further conversation to return to his work.
183296: "Enough questions!" he declares and then with an ironic smile, he adds,
"For now. I must return to my business."
183372: He slowly loses interest and turns away.
183400: He mutters something unintelligible.
183424: He gives you a look that implies that the answer is obvious.
183460: He says, "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."
183504: "Some things are hidden from me," he murmurs.
183536: He stretches out his hand revealing a withered hand with a similar
golden band around a finger.
183592: "You know all that I know of this."
183616: He holds it in his hands for a moment and then sighs. "I have no need
of such things, now, but you still might."
183688: He looks it over for a moment and hands it back to you, shrugging.
183768: like some morningstar. The elderly man does not resist, but looks up
silently into your eyes, his mouth forming words that escape his lips with his
dying breath, "Father, forgive them...". Your
183964: In a sudden mad battle-rage, you charge the inhabitant. The elderly man
does not resist, but looks up silently into your eyes, his mouth forming words
that escape his lips with his dying breath, "Father, forgive them...". As you
beat him to the ground, and at the same moment, in parallel, you collapse,
wracked with pain as if from a rain of blows.
184170: The inhabitant takes the letter and turns it over in his hands,
murmuring exclamations of surprise and wonderment. He thanks you resolutely
before saying, 'Now I must read. Pray excuse me.'
184296: The inhabitant shakes his head and gently dissuades you from that.
184332: It is the color of rainy days and smudged with dust.
184364: You have never felt a material quite it -- thin yet finely-woven, soft,
yet resilient.
184424: The inhabitant shakes his head and gently dissuades you from that.
184460: This is a gild-framed portrait of a blue-eyed striking brunette woman.
184508: A three-inch tall bronze trophy of a batter just prior to swinging, a
faded plaque below.
184564: It is part of the trophy. The name and the years have been effaced by
time, leaving only the words, "Corporate League Baseball".
184644: The stacks of paper tower precipitously.
184668: You find the endless descriptions of spreadsheets, ledgers, and
accounting jargon both mind-numbing and horrifyingly familiar.
184744: Pens, pencils, keyboards -- they comprise an undifferentiated mass of
tools and history -- slightly familiar but ruined.
184820: A faded plastic penguin, a miniature in sky-blue and white.
184860: Apparently stickers from past accounting conferences.
184892: Mediocrity. It takes a lot less time and most people won't notice a
difference until it's too late.
184956: Idiocy. Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups.
185000: Underachievement. The tallest blade of grass is the first one to be cut
by the lawnmower.
185056: A cheap plastic-rimmed circular mirror mounted to the side of the
monitor like an outside rear-view mirror.
185124: Your haggard face and bloodshot eyes stare back at you.
185160: The L-shaped desk is constructed of cheap laminated plastic that
appears to be wood.
185212: A vast sea of items overflows the desk, leaving no room for you to
clamber up on it.
185264: Rollcage cabinets opened wide reveal a bedazzling array of objects --
books, a plastic penguin, an imitation bronze batting trophy, and a picture of
a beautiful woman.
185368: Accounting manuals crowd the cabinets.
185392: It is a medium-sized dingy whiteboard hanging on the cube wall. It
reads, "The day after tomorrow."
185452: It reads, "The day after tomorrow."
185480: Fluorescent lights mounted at odd angles send down dying, artificial
light that provides a harsh, clinical hue for the dingy carpet and yellowed
walls. A set of stairs descends into shadows nearby, and open hallways lead
east and west.
185620: A gloomy staircase curls up into darkness here, spilling out to a dull
tiled floor that becomes carpet to the east. Recent footprints criss-cross the
floor, dusty tracks indicating repeated crossings. As the shadows retreat from
the light, you have the prickly feeling that you are somehow invading. The
light here seems especially dim, or perhaps threatened.
185832: You can only go east, south, and up.
185856: These are human footprints of recent imprint, indicating passage to and
from this area.
185908: They lead both up and to the east.
185992: An oddly-angled heavy door leads south. It is slightly off its hinges.
186032: It is a bulky steel door with tiny vents at eye level. It stands
slightly off of its hinges.
186088: The bulky steel door lies haphazardly upon its side like a beached
whale.
186132: You wedge the crowbar between the door and the doorjamb and pull with
all your might. With a snap and a sickening scraping sway, the door slips free
of its hinges and clatters sideways against the wall. Beyond, you can see a
long, ghostly hall of abandoned wires, hanging from the ceiling and shooting
from the walls like alien fungi.
186316: You try and try, but cannot pry the door back closed.
186348: The door grates along the concrete in an unpleasant sound of protest,
remaining closed.
186400: You don't have the strength to shut the door.
186428: You can barely make out a long dark hallway filled with tentacles.
186468: You can barely make out the wall behind it.
186492: You can neither lock nor unlock this door.
186516: These rusted bits dangle freely from the wall, separated from the door.
186556: Rusted bits, most of which are not holding the door in place.
186592: They are firmly attached to the door.
186616: They are standard hinges, a bit aged.
186640: These are tiny rusted air vents set into the door.
186672: They are an integral part of the door.
186696: Cables drip down from the ceiling and lurch out from the walls like
bizarre artificial life forms; multicolored, shooting from unknown origin to
unknown destination, draping over you as you move through the hall as if they
were reaching for you. A faint mist hangs in the air, lending the hall a
ghostly ambiance and only reinforces the sense of decay wrought by the
everpresent scent of crisped electronics and melted plastic. At the far end,
the hallway turns west.
186964: A faint blue glow spills out from the east.
186992: The fumes make you slightly nauseous.
187016: A light whitish mist lurks here just above your head.
187052: Long, short, twisted, straight, they are all multihued and damp to the
touch. Their sheer number unnerves you.
187120: The cable barely budges in response.
187144: Attempting to do so sends up a cavalcade of shooting sparks.
187184: The utility hall dead-ends here, in a tight, narrow room the size of a
walk-in closet. Discolored patches on the wall indicate where blueprints or
other diagrams once ruled; empty racks and savaged controls provide silent
witness of the power needs of a fully-occupied building.
187352: The utility hall dead-ends here, in a tight, narrow room the size of a
walk-in closet. Discolored patches on the wall indicate where blueprints or
other diagrams once ruled; empty racks and savaged controls provide silent
witness of the power needs of a fully-occupied building. The entire area is
flooded in faint blue light.
187548: In several areas, the wall is a few shades darker than the rest of the
wall.
187592: Metal racks mounted to the wall, stripped of controls.
187624: Dials, buttons, switches and readouts all made unusable by some
paroxysm of violence.
187678: A dented black panel seems to have largely escaped the abuse visited
upon the other controls.
187736: The dented black panel is closed.
187760: The panel, three feet wide by three feet tall, is mounted into the wall
just above shoulder level. It is marred by a large dent in its center.
187842: The panel, open wide, reveals a large array of circuit breakers. A
legend on the inside lists the breaker names A1 through A9. A large
three-pronged breaker is labelled "A1". Beside it, in a trembling script are
the words, "Fear the dark."
187994: The control panel swings open reluctantly.
188024: It seems to be about the size of a fist.
188048: It reads, "Fear the dark."
188068: Flat black, the circuit breakers appear well-maintained, even polished.
The first circuit breaker, a three-pronged behemoth, is labelled 'A1'. The
others are single-pronged breakers in a variety of positions, labelled 'A2'
through 'A9'.
188260: It is a large three-pronged breaker labelled as A1.
188294: A sound like a minor thunderclap hits the room, almost knocking you to
your feet. All fluorescent light vanishes. After a moment, faint blue light
streams down from above, bathing the area in a surreal retro feel.
188424: You heave the main breaker back to the on position. From down below you
hear the sounds of generators whirring back to life and machinery, perhaps
infernal machinery, returning back to full speed. The harsh fluorescent lights
flicker on and the blue emergency lights fade out.
188636: Boxes upon boxes of moldering accounting records are stored here,
decrepit records from a long-forgotten empire, cataloged for unknown purposes.
These records reach to the ceiling and even then, still overflow their decaying
cardboard prisons.
188788: Dust and old papers lace the air, giving the room the import of an
abandoned library.
188836: There must be a hundred of them if there are two, all overflowing with
cryptic records.
188892: You pluck a record at random to inspect it and find its illegible and
endless tables written in tiny script stultifying.
188968: The narrow passageway curves north to west here, widening here into an
unsettling scene. A haphazard pile of sheetrock, computer equipment, wood,
papers, all crushed into one monumental barrier, block all progress further
north. Perhaps someone blew up a wall, or insanely blocked themselves in,
piling up detritus bit by bit to create an impenetrable barrier. You can see
strands of hair mangled in the barrier, and the scent of sheetrock fills the
air.
189240: The combination of sheetrock and dust lends the air a suffocating
quality in addition to evoking imagery of perverse construction sites.
189320: The barrier easily resists your efforts.
189348: The barrier yields up nothing to your analysis; it remains a fearful,
artistic, awful statement of separation and slow madness.
189428: The barrier is only as tall as the room; you climb up and seeing
nothing interesting, climb back down.
189488: The hall ends suddenly to the south, walled off.
189516: An abandoned entryway, carpet threadbare with the passage of many feet,
cradles shadows to itself. An L-shaped desk rots here, peeling and protruding
warped slivers and the unmistakable odor of dead flowers permeates the air. The
room is more than abandoned; the air of abject defeat lurks in the shadows and
dingy corners here as though some kind of suicide had occurred here.
189744: A few steps to the south you find the hallway blocked off by what seems
to be layers upon layers of steel, barely distinguishable in color from the
surrounding walls.
189836: The smell of dead flowers permeates the air.
189864: You step out into the hallway and the world shimmers like waterfalls of
soft light. When you regain your focus, the world has aged.
189942: Blinking and breathing deep, you find yourself underneath fluorescent
lights in the late afternoon, air-conditioned air brushing over your arms and a
potpourri of scents in the air: construction materials; flowers; leather.
No-one seems to be here, as if the entire building were assembled at a company
function, somewhere.
190136: At chest height is the secretary's desk, a hardwood L-shaped desk that
juts out slightly into the hall. You can see people forgetting their pens here,
or leaning over to talk to the secretary on the other side. At present, several
vases sprouting flowers decorate the desk, barely obscuring the mid-back chair
and the computer, lurking in the interior. To the south you see a dull pewter
push-button combination lock set into a heavy wooden door, which stands wide
open.
190408: The fragrance of lilies and lavenders fill the air.
190440: Lilies and lavenders fill the room with an airy and relaxing fragrance.
190484: It runs a mindlessly-entrancing screensaver that you have to struggle
to tear your eyes away from.
190544: Translucent floral-patterned slender vessels, they hold lilies and
lavenders.
190596: The flowers smell like springtime dusk.
190620: That's not apparent by looking at it.
190644: It is a pushbutton combination lock, with numbers as small pushbuttons
set into its pewter housing.
190704: The buttons click softly in some maddening sequence, but the door
remains open and the lock, inactive.
190764: It is an integral part of the door.
190784: A heavy wooden door swung wide, it houses a pewter pushbutton
combination lock. You have seen several of these doors in the building, but
never have you seen one left open.
190884: You cannot lock or unlock this door.
190904: You hesitate. Someone has left this open for a reason, and you'd get in
big trouble if you closed it. Besides that, you don't know the combination to
the lock. If you closed it, you could never open it again.
191028: A staid well-kept hall extends north and south. Tasteful paintings
decorate the wall at precise intervals, and the wooden baseboards that trace
the hall like elegant guides. To the north the hallway swerves around a heavy
wooden door.
191164: Polished strips of wood line the walls, connoting elegance.
191200: The hallway ends here before a painting of a lush tropical marshland
with a singular palmetto tree in the center, and a water cooler squatting
beneath the painting. Sheetrock dust and tracks lead through an entranceway to
the south, while other open rooms are to the west and southeast.
191360: A confused construction workers' footsteps in sheetrock dust, they
indicate passage to and from the south.
191424: A water cooler, roughly three feet high, and currently empty. The
cylindrical translucent plastic container perches atop the dispenser,
condensation dripping down the inside. It has one button, which is stuck open.
191556: The cylindrical translucent plastic container perches atop the
dispenser, condensation dripping down the inside.
191624: An ordinary button for an ordinary water cooler.
191656: An ordinary button for an ordinary water cooler.
191688: There's only so much you can do with a stuck-open button on a water
cooler.
191736: Fine tapestries depicting medieval hunting scenes drape the walls, and
plush carpets cover the floor. The bookshelves are lined with books not about
business as you can tell even by a quick perusal, and several objects d'art
occupy the room, from primitive steer skulls to intricate pewter figurines and
a broadsword that sits lengthwise on the large desk here. The chair is wheeled
off to one side, as if inviting you to sit, and an air of repose permeates the
room. It was as if time flowed more slowly, here, and there was time for things
such as philosophy and other arts forgotten by the modern world. Set into the
right side of the room is a spacious window, which allows you to see the world
outside in the fulness of spring. The rich forest outside bristles with
sunlight like dewdrops and single-toned birds flit from tree to tree.
192224: The bookshelves contain books from many ancient and eld sources,
ranging from Spencer to Augustine to Kant.
192288: An empty space shows that a book has been removed.
192324: The shelves are crammed full of books; the only place left to put one
is in that empty space.
192384: There's nowhere left to put a book.
192408: These are many ancient and eld sources, ranging from Spencer to
Augustine to Kant.
192460: These are many ancient and eld sources, ranging from Spencer to
Augustine to Kant.
192512: It is about the size of a single book, more or less.
192544: It doesn't fit, either physically or contextually.
192576: It is a wide, spacious window revealing a lush spring forest beyond.
192616: You see the world outside in the fulness of spring. A rich forest
bristles with sunlight like dewdrops and single-toned birds flit from tree to
tree.
192704: Now THAT would really get you in trouble. You reconsider.
192744: There's not a speck of dust on the window.
192768: Typical of the modern office, the window is designed to be neither
opened nor shut.
192816: Richly-detailed tapestries depicting fox-hunts and noble quests.
192860: An elegant show-sword mounted across a sequoia-red block of wood, edge
vertical.
192912: These reflect wizards, priests, and warriors in various Baroque poses
of combat or concentration.
192972: Pale and bleached steer skulls hang decoratively around the room.
193012: Like new cars have a special scent to them, so do new rooms, especially
new rooms in a new wing of the building. Caulk and traces of sawdust, overlaid
with the formaldehyde-like odor of new carpet, all swirl together to make that
familiar scent. There is no office furniture here and even the ceiling tiles
don't appear properly situated yet. You think to yourself that someone will be
fortunate to have this room.

There seems to be something odd about the east
wall.
193284: Caulk and traces of sawdust, overlaid with the formaldehyde-like odor
of new carpet swirl together to create a familiar new office scent.
193372: Off-white and misaligned, the ceiling tiles sit oddly askew.
193412: The fine-grained lumber remnants tickle your nose.
193444: You inspect it closely and discover that the construction crew
performed a flawless caulking job.
193584: Sandwiched between larger rooms, this shoebox-shaped office extends in
a compressed, rectangular shape back from the long hall outside. The main work
seems to occur in the far corner, judging by the desk that touches both walls,
the two hooded computer monitors, and the mid-back, black leather chair.
Complex mechanical designs cover the walls on blueprint paper. Several books
lie open with illegible scribblings in them, and most oddly, you notice a plush
skeleton, the size of your hand sprawled out. You have the feeling that you are
intruding on some kind of workshop, and it makes you vaguely uneasy, though you
don't know exactly why. Maybe it's because you've only been here a few weeks.
Or maybe it's because you can't place what this person does for a living.
194036: They are illegible.
194052: They display rotating three-dimensional anatomical models of the human
form.
194100: These are anatomy, physiology, cybernetics, and robotics manuals.
194144: Complex structural diagrams that seem somehow related to the human body
hang in rumpled protest.
194204: It is a seemingly cute plush skeleton with a rather disturbing grin.
194244: The hallway bows outward slightly to form a small alcove. The resulting
space is dominated by a towering faux-walnut cabinet. It bristles with beige
slots like regiments, each layered one atop the next, labelled with inscrutable
names. Below the slots lurks a single large cubbyhole, labelled "In/Out".
194432: The names have yellowed and faded with time into utter inscrutability.
194476: The slots are empty and forgotten.
194500: In several areas, you can see where the walnut finish has worn away to
reveal steel. It seems very rigid and backs up flush against the wall.
194584: The cabinet barely budges in response.
194608: The cubbyhole is roughly six inches high, a few inches deep, and
layered in dust.
194656: You check and double-check. The cubbyhole still reads "In/Out".
194700: You reach into the cubbyhole and discover the gritty feel of dust.
194740: You reach into the cubbyhole and feel something else in addition to the
gritty dust.
194788: You sort through the mail; although sent to a variety of places, every
letter you find has been cancelled and stamped "No Forwarding Address. Return
to Sender."
194890: One catches your eye -- its tropical sea-blue color and feminine
cursive script convey a sense of intimacy even from the outside. It is
addressed, but not stamped.
194996: You search in vain for an interesting letter, letting the dead
envelopes fall through your hands aimlessly.
195056: You hesitate at invading the privacy of the letter writers.
195092: Reading the letters is like reading the gravestones of strangers, each
one stamped with the R.I.P of "No Forwarding Address. Return to Sender."
195184: It reads, "No Forwarding Address. Return to Sender."
195224: Its cover dancing with eldritch blue light, the book is named by an
arcane acronym. Quotes of appreciation from luminaries in obscure fields
decorate its back cover.
195328: You look around and suddenly cannot understand the mental construct you
find yourself within. What does %1 mean? Who or what is regex?
195414: You run shrieking as fast as you can and find yourself in a long bland
hallway, panting and looking with stark horror at the strange world beyond that
flickers electric blue.
195516: As you read through the pages of the tome, a feeling not unlike a
migraine headache overtakes you; your vision momentarily swims with strange
formulae and you feel both amazed and mentally bloated. You close the book and
see the world differently.
195660: You suspect that reading any more might cause you to lose the
information you've just acquired. Like rich food, the mind can only digest so
much arcanum at once.
195756: You notice no dedication, bookmark, or signs of personal ownership. In
fact, it looks virtually unused. You close it once more.
195832: Ebullient praise.
195848: It is a sky-blue envelope, addressed, but not stamped. It smells
faintly of a woodsy perfume. It is from Jennifer, but you can't make out to
whom it is addressed.
195948: It doesn't seem to be addressed to you.
195976: You respect his privacy more than your curiousity.
196008: You read off the addresses from the unsent letter. The sender's address
reads: 

Jennifer Galloway
545 Emerson Dr. NE
Coral Springs, GA
31415

The
receiver's address is a blur of smudged rain-distorted ink.
196156: It smells faintly of a woodsy perfume.
196180: The hallway glows with a faint electric-blue light that pulses
rhythmically, like a pacemaker. The walls, floor, and ceiling all exude this
spectral light that seems an intrinsic part of their design, as though it
defined them, and not vice-versa. The ghostly flicker of light suggests that
you are in someplace not altogether tangible, but perhaps a mental construct
somewhere, somehow.
196412: As you enter the flickering light you become confused and disoriented.
You stumble out right where you entered.
196476: You can go only north, west, and in.
196496: You can go only north, east, west, and in.
196520: If the interior decorators of this age received awards for
uninteresting hallway decoration, this was their shining moment. The bland
hallway continues east towards a blue flickering light. A door leading north
interrupts the fashionable monotony. Barely cracked open, the door reads
"Authorized Personnel Only."
196706: A long, bland hallway bathes in flickering blue light that emanates
from its far eastern end. You can barely make out a door to the north.
196786: If the interior decorators of this age received awards for
uninteresting hallway decoration, this was their shining moment. The bland
hallway continues east towards a blue flickering light.
196904: As you enter the flickering light you become confused and disoriented.
You stumble out right where you entered.
196968: A door is set into the south wall. Currently, it is closed.
197004: A door leads to the north. It is currently closed.
197032: It is an heavy wooden door with a steel knob. Affixed to the door is a
sign which reads in an imposing red sans-serif font: "Authorized Personnel
Only."
197128: The locking mechanism in the door has long ago rusted through,
rendering the door unable to be locked or unlocked.
197192: As you might expect, the sign reads, "Authorized Personnel Only". At
the bottom right-hand corner of the sign, you discover the copyright notice in
miniscule text. It reads,"(C) 2003-2005, Phoenix sign company".
197336: The sign is firmly attached to the door.
197360: The door easily swings wide at your touch. Apparently, you are
authorized.
197406: The remnants of a computer control room, this room now provides a case
study in destruction. Seven-foot high cabinets lie face down, their glass
windows shattered in brilliant light-refracting sprays of broken glass; cables
of every shape and hue lie severed from the wall as though victims of a bizarre
type of autopsy. Computers lie caked in dust with their innards removed and
scattered in pieces across the floor. Dust covers even these, as though these
acts occurred several generations ago.
197704: A worn leather backpack lies here in the dust.
197728: This is a backpack made from leather and ruggedly designed to withstand
the elements and time itself.
197788: A crowbar lies abandoned here.
197808: The crowbar is about the length of your arm, black steel and curved at
the far end. It has the proper amount of heft, being neither too light nor too
heavy.
197900: Each is neatly severed and snakes back into the building, bundled
together with unnumbered unlabeled others.
197964: You can't wrest a cable free from the wall.
197988: You manage to create some slivers of plastic and copper, usable for
nothing.
198036: Shattered and immobile, the cabinets once housed various computers and
other arcane hardware.
198096: You try, but fail to even budge the cabinet.
198124: The cabinets are shattered hulks of wreckage, unable to be opened or
closed.
198172: Once windows to cabinets, these are now but a spray of glass --
hundreds of tiny shards that reflect a rainbow of light.
198248: You would cut your fingers for sure.
198272: You try, but you can't get a solid grip on the tiny slivers.
198308: Here, the walls crackle with faint electric-blue light, outlining giant
square sections in the floor, walls, and ceiling, and send their light
scattering in accidental beams from one side to the next. These beams of light
are made possible by the dust, aroused by your footfalls. Doorways lead north
and south to smaller rooms, and a stairway leads down to the east.
198516: The blue light seems to glow here less strongly than elsewhere, as if
it were dissipated by some stronger force; up above, dead fluorescent light
bulbs lurk, burned out, the beige peeling walls, and the hastily erased
whiteboard convey the feeling of a meeting just about to begin, yet somehow,
forever delayed. Even though the door to this room has been removed long ago,
you cannot escape the claustrophobia that settles on you like an albatross
around your neck. That, and the muggy, stale air that stinks like spilled
coffee, dry-erase markers, old clothes, and rotting wallpaper that seems to
outgas from the walls themselves.
198888: The air stinks like spilled coffee, dry-erase markers, old clothes, and
rotting wallpaper.
198946: You cough as you leave the room, ridding yourself of its malodorous
air.
198992: The rotting, peeling strips feel like gauze torn from wounds.
199028: Out of reach and lightless husks, they crouch as if waiting to fall
upon you.
199076: It is a large whiteboard nearly grey with repeated marking and partial
erases.
199124: You can barely make out words, as though many erases could not wipe
them clean: "Leave while you can."
199184: Dead lightbulbs that cluster like poisoned insects in the ceiling
above.
199228: The office unfolds before you as a testament to rotting splendor. The
tatters of a rug kiss your shoes in dying bliss; elegant shelves cover opposite
walls, only steps from sawdust, their books now collapsed into dust. The
imposing mahogany desk is rotted with age and spackled with layers of dust, and
the fancy office chair is rotted leather. Sitting in the chair, the desiccated
king of this forgotten empire, is a skeleton, its eyesockets dead and empty,
staring at you in morose torment. It is not hard to imagine that he once had
the same expression in life.
199560: The office unfolds before you as a testament to rotting splendor. The
tatters of a rug kiss your shoes in dying bliss; elegant shelves cover opposite
walls, only steps from sawdust, their books now collapsed into dust. The
imposing mahogany desk is rotted with age and spackled with layers of dust, and
the fancy office chair is rotted leather.
199764: They are now so fragile that they barely remain standing.
199800: It is nothing but tatters now, barely recognizable as a rug.
199836: The combination of dust and decaying leather seeps into your lungs.
199872: Latched around his left wrist is a gold watch.
199900: Inclining your ear to the watch, you hear its precise gears spinning
softly and are reassured by its heartbeat-like steady ticking.
200078: The watch feels strangely heavy around your wrist.
200112: You feel fatigued and numb as if a low-grade poison was circulating
throughout your system.
200168: Every movement seems like it takes the strength of seven men.
200210: Gingerly you pull the gold watch off the bony hand and find yourself
nearly bedazed by its workmanship. Idle visions flood you of it glittering
around your wrist.
200308: The watch does not need to be wound. Oddly, it appears to have been
wound recently.
200360: The watch slips around your wrist effortlessly and in a few sly
seconds, you find yourself perfectly attenuated to its weight. You take a deep
breath and feel more confident, taller, and stronger. And yet, from somewhere
far away comes a distant scream as if someone were dying, someone that you
know.
200538: Your eyes dart to the skeleton and his jaw takes on the unmistakable
expression of a grin. Before you can blink, he dissolves into ash.
200620: You remember the skeleton sitting in the rotting chair and waves of
unease wash over you.
200672: The elegant gold watch gleams; from its flawless crystal face to its
tiny whirring gears ticking reassuringly, it exudes the sophistication and
simplicity of design usually reserved for expensive things. It has no hands and
the only time it displays consists of three embossed gold letters, "NOW."
200856: The thought of sitting with the remains disturbs you.
200884: The thought of standing on the remains disturbs you.
200912: The tall, gaunt skeleton sits upon his rotting throne, frozen in death.
200956: Whether in mercy or disgust, you can't bring yourself to disturb the
remains.
201000: These are the ashes of the skeleton that once sat here.
201032: Whether in mercy or disgust, you can't bring yourself to disturb the
remains.
201076: This is an imposing, high-quality desk fit for an executive.
201116: You find it excruciatingly heavy and impossible to move.
201150: All the usual features of a busy desk time has obliterated, save one --
a small note written on a torn sheet of paper.
201224: It is a simple note, unaddressed. In a scrawling hand, it reads "I'm
sorry..."
201276: As you enter the flickering light you become confused and disoriented.
You stumble out right where you entered.
201340: The world is cast in bluish shadows of varying degrees of intensity, as
the glimmering western hallway of electric blue light provides the only
illumination. You can barely discern a concrete spiral stair leading down. All
else is shadows.
201480: From here, the world unfolds in three directions. A glimmering electric
blue hallway stretches out of sight to the west. At your feet, a concrete
spiral staircase winds precipitously downward. Above you, the stucco walls
stretch up into shadow, scratching the belly of the night sky. The air is
colder here, for you are outside the building proper, in what seems to be an
architectural afterthought. A rusted bannister part of the staircase
accompanies its steep descent.
201764: It is a rusted metal guide clinging to the stairwell as a feeble
gesture.
201806: You clamber down into the narrow rectangular opening.
201840: You can go only southeast, out, up and down.
201868: You can go only southeast, out, and up.
201892: A set of wide, well-worn concrete stairs ascend upwards, banking
perpendicular every ten feet in a square pattern. The walls are concrete block,
painted over with many layers of cheap paint, revealing the porous nature of
the blocks beneath.
202040: You realize that if you leave, you'll never reach the top. "Time is
money; money is time," the watch seems to say in its constant ticking.
202128: A dull silver rectangular plate is set into the floor in the far
corner.
202174: A dull silver rectangular plate is set into the ceiling just above your
head.
202228: It is a dull silver rectangle set into the floor. It is marred by many
scratches and the remnants of letters.
202288: It is a thin silver rectangle pushed into a narrow slot in the floor.
202328: With some effort, the plate shifts aside, revealing a spiral staircase
descending into shadow.
202386: With some effort, the plate shifts aside, revealing a concrete-walled
room above you.
202444: You can't seem to get a good grip from here.
202470: With some effort, you move the plate back into place.
202504: The letters have all been worn away as if eroded by the elements.
202544: There is nothing written on the underside of the plate.
202576: It is a dull silver rectangle set into the floor. It is marred by many
scratches and the remnants of letters.
202636: It is a thin silver rectangle pushed into a narrow opening in the
floor.
202676: You can't see enough of the plate to do that.
202700: A narrow rectangular opening leads down.
202726: A narrow rectangular opening leads up.
202752: It is a narrow rectangular opening, about the width of your shoulders.
202792: You can't see how to do that with the opening.
202820: The rusty door is swung open wide.
202840: The rusty door is shut.
202856: A rusty door stands before you, a long bar covered with flaking paint
used to push it open.
202908: It is an integral part of the door.
202926: You push the rusty door open wide.
202946: You push the rusty door open wide.
202968: The long narrow hallway feels endlessly long, as if someone had taken
your long intestine and laid it out horizontally and was reeling you in; that
same kind of discomfort and horror swirls here. The walls seem to bend and
stretch in the flickering light, which falls down like death from above through
shot-out fluorescent bulbs. The half that remain flicker in spasmodic, alien
patterns, casting the world in on-again, off-again light like camera flashes
from a constant evil paparazzi. Damp, fetid air swirls by you with varying
consistencies and low, forlorn moans echo through the hall, in consonantless,
indistinct fear.
203340: The moans echo and swirl around you in consonantless indistinct fear.
203384: Although comprised of a haze of mist, the figure seems to be a soldier,
a musket slung over his shoulder.
203448: The soldier flinches and his eyes examine you sadly.
203480: The soldier returns a brisk salute.
203504: He kneels to the ground as if burying something and then fades from
existence.
203548: It seems to be an old weapon, but it is quite indistinct.
203588: It barely covers him; it is in tatters.
203616: Faint and indistinct, yet clearly a soldier, the vision radiates a
sense of tragic nobility, as though he were the last fighter in a hopeless and
forgotten war. He stands three feet off the ground, seems to waver when he
walks, and is the color of smoke. His uniform is ragtag and threadbare, dotted
with a buckle or a rivet here and there; he carries a musket and a sabre
dangles from his side.
203848: A ghostly, hazy soldier walks three feet off the ground, patrolling the
hallway here.
203896: A low rumble takes control of the hall; an intense suction sound, it
ascends in frequency rapidly, like an air lock being resealed. Three feet away
and above, a figure shimmers into existence.
204016: He is gaunt, scraggly, and decked in the uniform of a soldier, ragtag
and threadbare. His eyes pierce you and his face is set as though he had a long
march ahead of him and too many behind him. A sabre, sheathed, falls from his
belt, and over one shoulder, his musket descends. The color of smoke, hazy and
indistinct, he stops short upon seeing you.
204228: The soldier flinches and his eyes examine you sadly.
204260: The soldier returns a brisk salute.
204284: The soldier notices the chest. He speaks, a voice rough as his
appearance, scratchy and inherently masculine. 'I see you've found it. My
chest.'
204376: With a gritty smile, he says, "I've done told you about yourself
already."
204428: "Me? I'm a restless soldier, and you have something that belongs to
me."
204480: "I don't have much time for jawin'. There's things I need to get to,"
he says.
204536: You can only go east and west.
204554: The dingy claustrophobic hallway continues in beige, its numbing
blandness whispering of distant diffused control. In place of the inner wall
stands double-doors of yellowed plexiglass, ten feet high, bisected by a rusted
steel column.

Through the doors you can make out the cafeteria --
uncomfortable school chairs and long rectangular tables separated by plastic
plants housed in plastic squares. A lonely cash register heads a countertop
that extends back into shadows. Unnaturally thick spiderwebs criss-cross the
windows and cover the entire area in a mad yarn maze of sickly white.

To the
east, the hallway ends suddenly. Where doors once were, looms only empty space,
and the night lit with dying floodlights.
204984: You don't see any obvious way to do that.
205012: You realize that if you leave, you'll never reach the top. "Time is
money; money is time," the watch seems to say in its constant ticking.
205100: You don't see any obvious way to do that.
205128: These are double-doors of yellowed plexiglass, ten feet high, bisected
by a rusted steel column. They are firmly shut.
205204: The doors jangle slightly, as if a thick chain were keeping them shut
steadfastly.
205252: A solid rectangular hunk of rusted steel, it extends the entire height
of the doors.
205304: It feels slightly cool to the touch.
205328: You discover no weak points in the column, nor anything else worthy of
note.
205372: These are seemingly endless webs that bathe the cafeteria in a sea of
ghostly white.
205424: They are out of reach, in the cafeteria.
205448: Plastic ferns and palmetto bushes secured in equally artificial plastic
squares.
205500: They are locked in the cafeteria.
205520: These are uncomfortable school chairs, with plastic seats and spindly
steel legs, wrapped in spider-silk.
205588: They are locked in the cafeteria.
205608: Long rectangular tables, they are no different from those in elementary
school cafeterias.
205664: They are located in the cafeteria, behind plexiglass doors.
205700: It is an electric cash register, shaped like a half-circle, of colors
grey and dingy white.
205760: It is in the cafeteria. You are not.
205780: As if a moment had been preserved until now, so the grotto appears at
first glance. But upon a closer look you see that the picture is slightly
misshapen and out-of-focus. The slender saplings instead bear withered,
sinister-circular boughs; the white stone benches surrounding circular tables
sit like time-frozen gargoyles, tensed and dingy-brown with mold. The hedges
lurk in the shadows from the floodlights mounted high on the building exterior.
It is a picture of tea-time slightly after dusk at a meeting-ground for ancient
foes.
206096: Dingy-brown mold lurks around the edges of the benches like perverse
frames.
206140: These weave in unnatural twisted patterns.
206168: Sculpted from the same formerly white stone as the tables, the benches
are frozen to the ground.
206224: The tables are circles of dingy white anchored by arcs of malevolent
intricacies.
206312: The sphere sits placidly on the table.
206336: You feel fidgety, as if you were sitting on a constantly-shifting flame
and eventually stand up.
206392: The slender saplings arc upwards into shadow, their boughs weaving
twisted, unnatural patterns.
206452: The sapling rustles as if in warning.
206472: The sapling is mollified by your efforts.
206500: A cramped, tight spiral staircase ascends and descends into shadow. It
has all the hallmarks of being constructed secretly, minimizing the space it
occupies both horizontally and vertically; you have to crouch to move in either
direction. Your footfalls echo tinnily as if from iron and the staircase winds
in many dizzying turns, revolving around a singular emptiness.
206712: The stairs peter out into a dank alcove, little more than a
slightly-rounded passage. The concrete abruptly gives way to packed earth below
and natural stone above. The air is still and undisturbed.
206832: To the southeast, you hear a faint arrythmic thrumming.
206866: The passageway is far too narrow. But worse than that, a faint
thrumming quickly crescendoes into nearly ear-splitting volume, pulsing in
confusing, maddening disharmonic beats that drive you back to where you stood
before.
207004: From all around you, a faint thrumming becomes a pounding, clashing,
maddening series of disharmonic pulsations. Ears ringing and feeling
disorientated, you stagger back to a safe haven.
207114: The thrumming increases in intensity and frequency; you just barely
make it through.
207168: A tight passageway barely wide enough for you skirts and juts
confusedly from the east to the northwest through the rock. Fragmented
crumbling stone and dead-ends interrupt smooth, water-worn walls. A low
thrumming rises and falls in earthen tones, coming from all around.
207324: The arrhythmic pulsing of the passage drowns out all other sounds.
207362: The passageway is far too narrow. But worse than that, the thrumming
increases to a nearly ear-splitting volume, pulsing in confusing, maddening
disharmonic beats that drive you back to where you stood before.
207490: The thrumming becomes a pounding, clashing, maddening series of
disharmonic pulsations. Ears ringing and feeling disorientated, you stagger
back to a safe haven.
207588: The thrumming increases in intensity and frequency; you just barely
make it through.
207640: You can go only east, west, and up.
207662: Reaching the end of the passageway, you see where it turns
near-vertical and clamber up that incline. Loose earth above you yields to your
efforts, and you emerge from the earth in another place.
207780: An eerie hush bathes the area; you can hear your ragged breath, the
friction of your shoes upon loose rock, and if you listen hard enough, the
lonely beating of your heart.
207884: The claustrophobic passage spills out into a wide, gently sloping
passageway. It heads upwards as the ceiling descends, forcing you into a
hunching gait; even so, you relish the relative freedom of movement. The
darkness seems a few shades lighter far ahead.
208040: Stooping down, you gradually adjust to the greater darkness here below
the earth, and the scramble-hunch you adopt to avoid the low ceiling. The scent
of dank earth assails you and judging by the echoes and the flicker of shadows
from the sphere, the walls are feet away. An eerie hush bathes the area; you
can hear your ragged breath, the friction of your shoes upon loose rock, and if
you listen hard enough, the lonely beating of your heart.
208296: The road ends here, turning from asphalt to dirt before the wilderness
makes it nothing but overgrown dreams. The dirt is loose under your feet, as if
this place was rarely visited, now. A somber calm drapes the area, broken only
by the forlorn hum of grasshoppers and the wind through dark trees.
208472: A paddle lies here, half-buried in the dirt.
208500: A wooden paddle four feet long.
208520: As if felled by lightning or some divine decree, a telephone pole lies
snapped in two; a serrated stub protrudes a few feet upwards, while the
majority of the pole angles downward into the ravine water. The downed lines
trellis the pole and send off sparks on a regular basis, lighting the night
like a series of sickly camera flashes. The road continues to the north and
south.
208740: The water is frigid and murky and soaks you to the bone. You think it
is quite eerie the way that the sparks turn the world into an photographic
negative. They illuminate the water around you in a similar matter. You see for
a single moment, the strange garish world of canal life illuminated before your
heart stops.
208924: You hear the incessant hum of electricity punctuated by spitting
crackling.
208972: Brilliant bursts of electric white-blue -- high-voltage transients.
209020: These trail from the pole into the water, carrying sparks that dance
over the surface of the water and land on the ground at your feet.
209092: The lines spark and hum violently. You have a moment of watching
blue-white electrical transients dance over your skin like insane spiders
before your heart stops.
209196: Ozone charges the air and makes you faintly dizzy.
209228: The pole illuminates the night as if a photographic negative. As you
are touching it, it illuminates you too; you have a moment of seeing yourself
lit from the inside out before your heart stops.
209348: It is murky, viscous fluid that makes that burbles at odd intervals,
dotted with dying plant life.
209408: The water stinks of rotting vegetation.
209432: Your stomach convulses as you draw near to the water and you jerk
backwards.
209478: into the ravine. It sinks down into the sick waters without a trace.
209520: The cattails and marsh ferns droop in their sallow, rotted colors.
209560: A steep fissure into which have crawled dark waters; here, the ravine
softens into an easy shoulder, permitting access.
209640: The water stinks of rotting vegetation.
209664: Your stomach convulses as you draw near to the water and you jerk
backwards.
209710: into the ravine. It sinks down into the sick waters without a trace.
209752: The road continues north and south, decaying and degrading with every
foot south. The trees rise silently in the night, hemming in the road with
bristling, askew branches wound together like evil fingers. Along the ravine,
clumps of dead grasses rise and fall lifeless in the intermittent wind, carried
along for a moment by its desolate and dying song.
209960: They are clumps of dead grass, browned and lifeless but for stirring by
the wind.
210012: The rust looks quite advanced and you expect it to give way underneath
your weight.
210064: You stand here before the ravine, the dark of night around you
descending into a bottomless, lightless void that seems to lick at your feet in
the gusts of night wind. Beyond the ravine, you can see frail trees huddled
together, and you can hear the sounds of the highway in the distance as though
they emanated from a distant world.
210244: Sounds of the highway, distant and oddly refracted rise up from the
north, separated by periods of crouching silence.
210316: Once within the dark waters up to your hips, you notice that they shift
and burble in unexpected manners, like oil. Grotesque fish brush past you, with
rough scales and garish expressions. Swimming quickly loses its appeal and you
hurry out.
210460: You find the waters uncommonly frigid -- much too cold for your
comfort. Even minutes after leaving the waters, you still feel their chill.
210544: It is a mid-sized car, or rather the remains of one. Doors, windows,
and seats have all been stripped, leaving it a rusting chassis through which
the wind whistles forlornly. Strangely, the glove compartment has been left
intact.
210680: Barely distinct from the shadows, you discern the rusted wreckage of an
automobile, sideways-spun into the ravine.
210748: The wind whistles eerily through the skeletal structure of the car.
210784: There's not enough surface of the car left to do that.
210856: There's not enough surface of the car left to do that.
210924: You doubt that the rusted iron will support you.
210952: You doubt that the rusted iron will support you.
210980: In the wrecked car is a glove compartment.
211008: Two hands wide, the glove compartment sits untouched.
211040: Further along the road, you can see the building rise from the ground
high enough to partially occlude the moon; it sits wreathed by floodlights and
a chain-link fence. The whole scene seems strangely unreal and garrulous,
beckoning and yet somehow mocking in its silence. Trees form an uninterrupted
thicket to the west, crouching on the other side of the ravine. The rough road
continues to the north and to the south.
211272: The prospect of running headlong into the dark across multiple lanes of
traffic is not attractive to you even in your darkest moments.
211446: H.
211452: Bursts of music, the roar of occasional vehicles and the distant
twitter of crickets reach you.
211512: The combined scents of carbon dioxide, grasses and night-flowers,
cigarettes and cheap food settle around you like old familiar clothes.
211592: You have reached the end of the road, for here it ends in the
intersection of a major highway. Cars hurtle past like comets, momentary
blazing visions of light and sound, just as random in their destinations and
their origins. At once you sense the freedom of the open road and its
accompanying scents -- carbon dioxide, grasses and night-flowers, cigarettes
and cheap food -- and a world from which you are denied. The lives of those in
the cars will never be yours, and neither will your life be theirs. You can
only watch as the cars drive on through the night, occasionally blessing you
with glimpses of other life and other worlds. To the west, the ground slopes
downward into a place where all light ends.
211992: The trees and the fence rustle like manacles.
212020: The road here sheds one of its lanes, collapsing into two. A faint
double yellow line begins here and extends into the shadows north. The trees
beyond the ravine whisper to themselves about beginnings and endings. Although
the building is barely visible here, its protective apparatus remains, a
chain-link fence that rustles like the sound of manacles. Here, the world seems
to draw closer and to press in upon you; the trees and fence rustle as one.
212288: Impenetrable grasses have conquered the area to the east.
212324: The asphalt bows slightly here, giving the impression that this
wasteland of faint yellowed lines and ruptured tar-colored material was just a
reservoir for ghosts and their vehicles, emptying in liquid haze to the south
at a four-way junction. The yellowed light falls like in insult to your eyes
down from lights that sprout up like antennas at odd intervals, light the color
of spent cigarettes. Dead trees throw lifeless arms to the sky, caged in
crumbling medians.
212600: These are withered, frail outlines of bark and root.
212632: These are fragments washed ashore on a sea of earth.
212664: You are at the entrance to the work complex. A sign with the company
logo eroded stands off to the left rotting at its supports. Dead foliage lies
in autumnal tatters around it as though it had been gassed. Ruts in the
pavement hewn by years of travel lead north, south, and east, further in to the
complex.
212840: These are desiccated-brown dead leaves and stalks.
212872: It is a small gardening shovel, about half the length of your arm. It
was probably used for floral maintenance.
212940: A glinting blade lies half-buried in the earth.
212972: You don't see any obvious entrance to the small dark building.
213012: You can't scale the gate and it is locked, besides.
213044: A small dark building, nearly invisible in the night hugs the ground
before you, squatting as if some malevolent, alien entity, its eyes
shard-windows, dimly reflecting distant starlight.
213152: The gate closes shut swiftly behind you.
213176: You stand in the parking lot where a stubby patch of heavily-used
pavement connects the parking lots to the north and south, the entranceway to
the west and a meandering road to the east. Ruts and potholes are worn deep in
this road and occasionally you see the petulant earth has gnawed away at the
asphalt from the bottom of shoe-sized potholes.
213372: The grasses are impenetrable.
213392: The fence bars your way.
213564: A faded blue sign crouches at the top of a twisted streetlight.
213636: It is too far up.
213648: You can go only north, south, and apparently up.
213676: The last streetlight casts its ever-dim light here, leaving this a land
on the edge of twilight; here, where the light ends and the shadows begin is a
matter of shifting, depending on where the wind blows and the sway of the
streetlights. The ravine continues north and south and this road parallels it,
as the forests beyond gradually fall from yellowed light to autumnal brown and
then darkness. A broken bridge begins an arch over the ravine, but never
completes it; the road continues on in its lonely quest.
213968: It is one of those arched bridges usually found in parks and other
scenic locales. Why it burst asunder you cannot determine.
214040: Alas, you cannot reach the other side and you haven't the ability to
walk on air.
214086: A flickering starlit staircase is here in the center of the road.
214124: A celestial stairway leads straight up into the night sky.
214160: It is a flickering staircase, translucent and near-intangible,
comprised of swirling stars and held together by silvery starlight. It leads up
into the sky but fades before it reaches any destination.
214276: It is a celestial stairway, comprised of swirling stars and held
together by silvery starlight. The steps seem unreal but somehow altogether
solid. It leads up into the night sky, ending in clouds that look as though
they were struck by perpetual lightning.
214420: You try to climb the staircase, but your feet pass right through the
steps and you obtain a feeling of incompleteness.
214484: As you ascend the translucent stellar stairs, your steps seem lighter,
and the air you breathe becomes ethereal ambrosia. Your eyes glaze and memories
overtake you. 

You remember wanting to kill them all, and not in some
machine-gun madman style, but individually, slowly, horrifically. For their
failed attempts at poison, at rape, and the awful residue that remained, you
wanted them to suffer and to die suffering. But once the gory fantasias of
blood-dripping walls had faded, you realized that even that would not have
sufficed. Even death would not repay you for everything they had stolen -- the
time, the life, the verve; even death could not restore the wide-eyed
wondering, hopeful youth that they had crushed into a taciturn, untrusting,
jaded adult. Hallways of dead bodies with faces rigid in rigor mortis would not
salve your wounds. It would be in vain. 

The building emptied slowly over
time. First it was one person, one machine, one cog disappearing, a name
searing everyone's lips and then forgotten; then it was a cluster or a
department; cubes were kept up at first but then left to gather dust. Sections
were blocked off. Secrets multiplied. 

You would come back on sad Fridays to
watch the parking lot grow ever-fewer with cars. You noted the hunched
shoulders of the dispirited few escaping for the week, long after the building
had disgorged you. Whether it was a vision or a desire, you do not now recall
-- that of an imploding building, as if weakened from within, collapsing in on
itself without sound. 

Soon after that the building was zoned off with police
barricades. You still stole back there to wash down the day's troubles with
some memory-ridding beverage, hoping to be there after the last person left,
the last engineer from the demolition crew, so that you could rejoice in your
solitary victory. Then you could quote in triumphant irony, "We will bury you."
But you were more than a death master, more than a grave-herder. You clung to
the ethereal hope of transcending this and transcending the grave. You would
overcome all of this charnel asphyxiation. Somehow. 

One day, you were feeling
especially brave and you stole past the police barricades for a closer look.
The lobby entrance was still working; the badge reader its same unchanging
self. You remember sliding your badge through and then secreting it in the
nearby bushes. The doorway closed behind you and you breathed in deep the scent
of must and despair. You had returned. And though you had just arrived, you
knew that there remained much work to do. 

The scene shifts and you see
through the haze a girl dressed up as an angel; she is pretty after a gothic
fashion, with dark hazel eyes, an angular face, and shoulder-length auburn
hair. You know her name. She leans in on her tip-toes, her hands brought
together at about navel-level (her opalescent white dress with man-made angel
wings on her back shimmers) holding a luminous golden sphere. She walks a
hallway between worlds. You cannot possibly believe that she is an angel and
yet around you rings the question, "In what form do you wish angels to appear?"
As you watch, she turns a corner and leans to the side, placing the sphere
inside a wall. 

You cross the final step into the clouds. A sense of drowning
peace overcomes you as the lightning swirls around you, bright, warm, but
somehow not harmful. Your eyes grow heavy and you awake as from a thousand-year
dream, in another place.
216540: The wheat-like grasses produce a faint susurrus.
216572: Here, the wheat-like grasses wave back and forth, with a barely-audible
susurrus in the night wind. The asphalt road leads north and south.
216656: The descent is far too steep.
216676: You can go only east and west.
216696: Here, the road curves through the twilight towards the north. The
shoulder falls off precipitously into a gurgling river below. Far below, you
can see the eddies of white water and see the reflected sparkles of things
caught in the flowing obsidian waters.
216840: You plunge through the night and at last into the river below. The
impact paralyzes you; the waters invade your lungs, crowding out air and then
life itself.
216928: All is still and silent upon the lonely road. The black road continues
in an arc both west and northeast with little shape or feature, as it fades
into the night around the edges. Plants struggle for life at the edges, and
occasionally you sight their withered blades and desiccated roots prying the
ground like sea anemones. They appear discordant, horribly out-of-place in
contrast to the sound of your footfalls, which provides the necessary somber
rhythm, one reminiscent of the shuffling meter of slaves in chains or that of a
dirge -- both summoning up unconsciously within you sorrowed memories that you
choke back uneasily, memories scattering as if bats from light.
217328: The anorexic plants struggle to subsist by the edge of the road.
217368: The prospect of running headlong into the dark across multiple lanes of
traffic is not attractive to you even in your darkest moments.
217542: H.
217548: You can go only south and southwest.
217568: The combined scents of carbon dioxide, grasses and night-flowers,
cigarettes, and cheap food surround you like old comfortable clothes.
217648: You hear each breath you make in the unquiet stillness.
217684: You hear a car roar by, music tinkling from within. It quickly fades
from earshot.
217736: Civilization ends here. The road that brought you here becomes a rutted
asphalt highway, which disappears into the surrounding night. The only thing
that reassures you of man's presence is the crumbling asphalt beneath your feet
and the rare appearance of a car speeding like a comet, on through the night.
Nothing else breaks the stark emptiness that surrounds you and the complete
absence of ambient light. The air is still as death and you are increasingly
conscious of each breath, for each breath feels like a horrible disturbance, as
if you were interrupting a tryst of shadows. Barely discernible, the road leads
back south.
218100: The hill heads down to both the east and the west. Which direction do
you wish to go down?
218152: You clamber up the hill and stand at the highest point for miles
around. The wind carries unspoken secrets across your skin, ceaselessly
whispering, and the grass at your feet whips in pantomime agony. You can easily
imagine the moon breaking through the clouds to cast dim light over the world
made in miniature -- the lake to the west; beyond it, the building; grassy
plains to the west; and you, the lonely ruler of it all. But the sky above is
stained with black clouds and the only light, that you hold in your hand.
218452: You stand on a hill beneath a cloudy sky. The grass beneath your feet
rustles uneasily, and the slight wind leaves you with a strange feeling of
faded grandeur. The hill slopes down west to the pier and east to an abandoned
field.
218584: Overgrown with different varieties of grass, the outfield possesses a
wild, organic, unkempt appearance. Walking is an uneven activity and you
half-expect to find something conquered by the greenery sitting silent and
rusted. The infield seems impossibly far away from here, as though you were the
last outfielder in a giant-sized stadium.
218786: You stumble and find that a small outcropping beshrouded by grass has
tripped you.
218838: Scouring through the grasses by sphere-light, you come across a hooked
outcropping of earth obscured by the flora.
218904: You pass your hands through the grass and across the rough ground, but
discover nothing.
218948: The hand shovel stabs the ground and so begins your quarry site. A few
moments later, the satisfying 'clink' of metal striking metal reaches your ears
and you know in part the archaeological joy of discovery. A few minutes more
and you have exhumed a rather large antique bronze chest.
219116: Shrouded by grasses, here the earth curls into a curious hook-like
outcropping.
219168: In a cluster of grasses to the side, you see a curious outcropping of
earth in a hook-like shape.
219228: Although spotted with weeds, missing bases, and the chalk lines but a
memory, the clay diamond shape still summons up all the majesty and mystique of
a baseball field. Specifically, you are in the infield, feet on the clay where
many batters, runners, and infielders have played. For a moment, stray dust
takes to the wind and you inhale the scents of yesteryear.
219440: Gangly weeds grow up at odd intervals across the area.
219476: You don't see any use for the weeds.
219500: The weeds have no particular smell.
219524: From home plate, the infield stretches before you like the doors to a
secret room, whispering wonder; the outfield stretches out beyond that like the
last rows in an immense theatre, beckoning your exploration. Even with the
plate missing, you stand in the shadow of the cage arching behind you and
breath the dreams of desolation and youth entwined.
219736: It is a rusty towering cage, anchored in the earth.
219764: After a few feet, it becomes clear that the rusty cage won't hold you
for very long. You quickly look around and seeing nothing unusual, climb back
down.
219856: A few flakes of rust come off in your hand. You shake them free,
somehow disturbed.
219908: You can go only northeast, east, and down.
219936: You can go only northeast and east.
219956: On the home side of the baseball field, the wooden stands raise up
against the night, silhouetted in classic carpentry against the dim moonlight.
They sway in the occasional wind, like an imposing jungle gym made enticing by
the unpredictable rhythm of silence and groaning and creaking. The feel of the
stands beneath your fingers is of unvarnished wood spliced with metal supports,
held aloft by rusting poles beneath.
220198: Beneath the stands is a dark passageway leading down into the earth.
220240: The rusting poles criss-cross the underside of the stands, supporting
their weight.
220288: Brackets of steel reinforce the wood at critical stress points.
220332: The stands themselves are made from wood, the way all real baseball
stands are.
220376: As you clamber up into the stands, they heave and sway mightily;
disappointed, you step off, concluding sadly that age has the best of them. And
yet, sudden, strange memories seem to swirl around those olden timbers.
220508: You feel only uneven wood and flaking rust.
220536: Looking closer, you discover a patch of skew earth, a square section
that looks as though it were sod thrown down hastily to cover something. You
tug at it and it eventually pries free, revealing a dark passageway down.
220668: You discover nothing more but the faint aroma of memories.
220700: The dark lake lies in that direction.
220724: The grass peters out to a stubbly shore, sand and shale ringing the
ominous lake like a final protective circle. All sound stops here, except for
the unsteady lapping rhythm of the lake. Though the lake fades quickly into the
surrounding shadow, it stretches off in either direction perpendicular. Mist
dances over the lake and through it, or perhaps part of it, and extending from
the opposite shore you can discern a pier.
220960: Wiry, sparse strands of green rise and fall in the silent wind.
221000: Indistinct writhing vapors ascend from the lake like spirits trying to
escape.
221048: An aging wooden pier skirts the shadow lake, its rotting timbers
plunging into the oddly-lapping waters like useless stakes into a greater
shadow. Although cobbled together in the distant past, it holds together still,
creaking and swaying in the occasional winds. It is set into a sparsely-grassed
hillside which leads up to the east.
221240: The dark lake lies in that direction.
221262: Upon reaching the pier, you secure the canoe with the bedraggled rope
wound around the pier.
221316: An old, waterlogged rope dangles trails down into the waters. It is
tied in a flurry of knots to the pier.
221380: An old, waterlogged rope dangles trails down into the waters. It is
tied in a flurry of knots to the pier at one end, and to the canoe at the
other.
221464: You find the old rope quite slippery.
221488: The rope is tied fast to the pier.
221508: To nothing? That's not possible, not even existentially.
221548: The rope is already tied at both ends.
221576: You can't find a good spot to tie the rope to that.
221604: You untie one end of the rope, but the other remains wound in intricate
knots around the pier.
221654: The rope is secured to the pier with knots too intricate to untie.
221696: In unsettling majesty, cliffs rise all around you, torturously steep.
Their layers of rock eroded to the waterside have recorded the tales
indecipherable of eons past, and their constant companion sits still, clear,
and endlessly deep around you. A narrow waterway escapes to the southwest.
221868: It is a narrow waterway; its rippling waters lead southwest.
221904: The lake here narrows gradually into an elongated funnel shape, the
waters roiling and hurrying towards a man-sized tunnel of dull steel. The earth
rises around you threateningly, allowing no room to land. Sickly plants grow up
around the tunnel.
222048: The stench of rotting vegetation clogs the air.
222076: The rocky banks ascend nearly vertically, hemming you in.
222112: You nearly cut your hand on the jagged stone.
222140: Crashing, thrashing waters echo all around, sounds of chaos reflecting
off the corrugated storm sewer pipe that you find yourself within. It glistens
in the dark from the damp environs, row after row off half-glinting
indentations like an indecipherable code. Crouching low, you barely manage to
keep the canoe stationary amid the roiling waters, which long to carry you
onward to the south.
222364: Crashing, thrashing waters echo all around you, as though you were
caught in a tinny thunderstorm.
222420: You make no headway against the rushing waters.
222452: The rushing waters carry you downstream.
222480: Rows upon rows of ridged, slippery indentations sound out an unknowable
code.
222528: They are a part of the storm sewer pipe that surrounds you.
222564: They feel slimy and ridged, like something alien.
222596: You sit in the center of the small, dark lake, crouched in the canoe.
An unnatural stillness has settled over the area as if you had entered a
predator's cave and all lesser things had hushed but the prey. Every slosh of
impenetrably dark waters against the prow seems amplified ten thousand times;
every breath seems monstrous; every sound seems refracted and oddly distorted.
You can see the west bank dimly through the darkness. From the opposite shore,
a decrepit pier looms like a rotting galleon out of the night.
222900: You can only see faintly, something large swimming through the waters.
222940: The creature seems to be getting closer.
222968: A sickening electric fear courses through you thinking of that.
223004: You reach out and succeed in popping the alligator on the snout. It
hisses, quite annoyed.
223060: You swing and catch only the water with your efforts.
223090: In an incredible feat of agility, you strike the alligator directly
between the eyes. Those baleful flickering lights flutter shut and the lake
water burbles as the beast sinks down into the mire.
223204: You hurl the ball at where you think the beast is, to no avail. The
canoe rocks in the disturbed water as the ball sinks into the lake.
223324: You raise the paddle to hurl it at the beast valiantly, like a
spear-thrower on a whaling ship, but the prospect of floating rudderless on
this lake chills you to the core. Thoughtfully, you lower the paddle.
223440: The water around you swishes and eddies as if something rather large
were swimming through it.
223492: A pair of dusky amber eyes peers up at you from just above the water.
Barely discernible in the night is the creature's scaly snout.
223570: The scaly water-beast snaps its jaws voraciously and charges the canoe.
223618: The alligator flips the canoe over with its clenching jaws. Time seems
to go into slow motion as you flail about for the canoe, never having learned
how to swim. Water sprays everywhere and you feel distinctly breathlessly and
ill-at-ease, as though you were treading water in liquid tar. Then in horror
you feel the water swirling beneath you. Excruciating pain rips through you as
the alligator severs both your legs and the pain wrenches your fingers free of
the canoe. Mercifully, you lose consciousness after that.
223924: The lake narrows to a semi-circle here as the surrounding ground
becomes steep, sparsely-grassed hills. At the far end water glurps and murmurs
out of a large open drain pipe, pouring dark waters deceptively quickly back
into the lake. Bony pale fish whip by the boat, chasing one another or nibbling
at things unseen far below. In the silence, the burbling waters echo
sinisterly, like the pumping of a foul heart.
224164: You can't make enough headway against the current.
224196: The water glurps and murmurs out of a large open drain pipe. In the
silence, the burbling waters echo sinisterly, like the pumping of a foul heart.
224284: A wide drain pipe, corrugated inside, roughly three feet wide and tall.
224328: The river flows onwards with little protest; the only sound is that of
gently flowing waters.
224384: The river mumbles onwards, snaking between cliffs. The cliffs grow up
around you, towering monoliths shrouded in shadow, nearly lacing their arms to
block out the starlight; the resulting darkness is profound, and settles in on
you like a damp, uncomfortable overcoat. A small beach juts out into the
waters, interrupting the curve of the river from west to northeast.
224600: The river becomes a tangled, throaty conversation among several
conflicting voices here.
224656: Shallower and rougher here, the river becomes a tangled, throaty
conversation among several conflicting voices. Skimming and skipping over
occasional rocks, it froths and churns as it twists. To the southeast, you
catch sight of a shallow shore; the river bends around it from the east to the
southwest. Piles of rocks like funeral markings hug cliffs providing silent
warnings.
224880: You try to do so and throw the canoe dangerously off-balance as a
result. Quickly, you recover.
224940: They feel smooth, worn by the waters.
224964: They are silent warnings, constructed in oddly primitive and fearful
shapes.
225012: As your fingers glide across them, you feel oddly disturbed as though
you were violating some ancient warning.
225080: You can't bring yourself to disturb them.
225104: A narrow bit of sand hugs imposing cliffs. The strand is shaped in the
form of a concave mirror, that disappears quickly into the waters to the
northeast and northwest.
225204: As you step foot into the dark waters, the strong current nearly sweeps
you off your feet. You recover your footing and head back.
225284: Remnants of the fire that become ash when you touch them.
225320: As you examine the ash, the wind carries it aloft to leave you with
only memories and its acrid scent.
225378: A burned-out campfire nestles into the night.
225412: It is a campfire, burned out long ago, now only embers, ashes, and dust
-- its driftwood kindling cinders long ago.
225488: It is a campfire, burned out long ago, now only embers, ashes, and dust
-- its driftwood kindling cinders long ago.
225564: The river ends here, billowing out into a cattailed finger-lake before
disappearing into a weathered indentation in rock, where it foams noisily. A
concrete drainage culvert extends a few feet into the water, leading at a
gradual incline up and west. All around you cattails grow, whispering amongst
themselves, wavering when you draw near as though within their stalks dwelled
knowing eyes.
225798: The canoe slides free from its uncertain mooring and disappears into
the weathered indentation, out of sight.
225860: The canoe rocks back and forth, buffeted by the violent waters.
225900: The river lies in that direction.
225920: The cattails rustle as you pass by, their stalks seeming to follow your
movements; they seem well-nourished and uncannily fertile.
226004: You brush a few aside but they reveal nothing but earth.
226040: They smell fresh and faintly milky.
226064: Their whispers beguile you; the meaning proves elusive.
226100: The culvert traces the incline and ends a few feet below the surface of
the water. Aged concrete, its surface is dotted with hairline fractures.
226188: You feel the pebbled surface typical of concrete beneath your fingers.
226232: The concrete culvert is far too heavy for that.
226264: These pit the surface of the culvert.
226284: You can't fit in there; the canoe might.
226308: Shaped roughly like an almond, the opening seems to be about the width
of your body, but only three feet high.
226372: The canoe disappears into the weathered indentation, out of sight.
226408: It disappears into the indentation without a trace.
226438: You stand atop a knoll tufted with wiry grasses, about ten foot in
diameter. The knoll ends at an imposing steel fence with a gate in its center
to the west and falls away to the east. Below, you hear the sound of madly
rushing waters. Beyond the fence, you can make out the hulking outline of a
small, dark building.
226620: You wrest the gate open and slide through.
226642: The gate is swung precariously open, beckoning you to enter in.
226684: The gate is comprised of corrugated steel set in a hexagon pattern. It
looks sturdy and its massive crossbars must weigh tens of pounds. Pushing the
gate draws a horizontal bar free from a latch, which allows the gate to open.
When shut, the horizontal bar reaches the latch, which locks the gate. You
could open the gate from where you stand, but you would be unable to do so from
the other side.
226908: The gate is created of corrugated steel set in a hexagon pattern. It is
quite heavy and opens from the other side.
226972: You can't seem to obtain a good foothold.
227000: You can't exert enough force against this side of the gate to open it.
227040: You put your shoulder against the gate and shove it open.
227072: You don't see any way to unlock the gate using a key.
227104: That's too heavy for the canoe to hold.
227132: That's too big to fit in the canoe right now.
227160: A weathered, wooden canoe of average size. It has a seat towards either
end and some odd letter-like scratchings near the prow.
227240: You're already sitting in the canoe.
227264: There's not enough room to sit on the canoe.
227288: A weathered wooden canoe emerges from the darkness and runs aground on
the shore.
227332: A small craft glides across the lake, carried by the dark waters
aground upon the opposite shore.
227496: The canoe cannot carry that much weight.
227520: The canoe cannot carry that much weight.
227544: You can't find enough of a surface to stand on the canoe.
227574: You untie the canoe and sail out into the lake.
227604: The canoe slices through the dark waters.
227626: Without holding the paddle, the chance of you steering the canoe are
slim.
227672: The canoe feels scratchy, especially near the prow.
227704: Scratched into the prow in a primitive hand (perhaps the etchings of a
man mad) is the word "Boomerang."
227768: You try to push the canoe while sitting in it. You almost lose your
balance and nearly tip the craft over.
227828: The canoe flies free, through the dark waters and out of sight.
227864: The canoe disappears into the weathered indentation, out of sight.
227900: The canoe saws back and forth in the water, the rope keeping it firmly
secured.
227948: Smooth, wooden seats are set into the front and back of the canoe.
227988: Scratched into the prow in a primitive hand (or perhaps the etchings of
a man mad) is the word "Boomerang".
228056: As you step that direction, you feel suddenly overcome with a sense of
incompletion. Somehow, something remains to be done and you step back,
wondering.
228148: A path threads south and east through a light, airy forest, the summer
afternoon sun creating a patchwork of light and shadow on the forest floor. To
the west, a wooden bridge gracefully spans a ravine that bends out of sight.
Squirrels hunt in the underbrush and skitter across tree limbs; swallows
twitter peaceably.
228340: Your lungs fill with the fragrance of birch, maple, and holly.
228380: The swallows twitter to themselves; the squirrels race across bark and
branch.
228432: You hear scritching sounds of claws upon bark and random chittering.
228472: The shiny-furred dark-eyed creatures scatter through the underbrush.
You catch glimpses of them, but that is all.
228540: You're not sure, but you think you can hear a laughter in their
chittering.
228584: Ruby-chested swallows of sparkling eye and golden beak.
228620: The underbrush rustles faintly in the wind.
228644: Briars, vines and fallen limbs and twigs, the underbrush rustles in the
wind.
228692: It would take quite some time to clear the underbrush.
228728: You move some vines and sticks but make no headway.
228760: A sturdy, though aged wooden bridge crosses a ravine, and you stand
upon its apex. Below, your eyes find the navy-blue creek that twists its way
over rock and between earth. The railings allow you to lean against them and
that is when you notice that they were not assembled using nails or planks, but
rather of fine-crafted wood and spikes.
228964: Thoughts of suicide are remarkably distant from you.
228996: These are unmachined strips of wood.
229020: Judging from what you can see of them, these are hand-crafted iron
spikes.
229064: You stand upon the high point of the bridge, which is also its center.
229104: Ornately carved and decorated railings, these extend a few inches above
the side at shoulder height.
229164: The railings give a little, but not much.
229192: The thought of destroying a graceful structure as this quickly
dissipates from your mind.
229248: Far below, the navy blue creek eddies over rock and stone.
229288: Far below, the navy blue creek eddies over rock and stone.
229328: You throw it from the bridge and watch it sail free into the gorge
below in a moment of pure Romantic wonderment. At last, the creek carries it
away, far from sight.
229424: You sense that the object has more value than that.
229456: You can hear the burbling and motion of water faintly from far below.
229492: The breeze whispers across wheat-like grasses causing them to rustle as
if in anticipation. Ahead, they give way to fields of closer-nestled greenery.
229584: These are clusters of wheat-like grasses.
229612: Further ahead, you see rows of wild, wavy grass.
229644: The grasses smell faintly earthen.
229668: A faint trail wends through lush, verdant grasses. Arching upwards to
gleam in the summer afternoon light, they dance in half-circles in the breeze.
Far away you hear the birds twitter in soft song.
229788: These are rows of wavy wild grass.
229812: The grasses seem to connote the very essence of summer in their fresh
scent.
229860: Far away you hear the birds twitter in soft song.
229892: Resting on a tuft of grass like some emerald egg, you see a jade
sphere.
229936: It is a simple ball of light jade color. It casts a faint greenish
glow.
229980: It hums as though with energy from within.
230004: It is a simple ball of a light jade color. It hums faintly
230036: A tuft of fresh grass, naturally formed.
230064: It rolls off to the ground below.
230084: The tuft bends and sways, but does not break.
230116: You can't seem to wrest it from the ground.
230140: It smells no different than the other wild grasses.
230172: It is a faint trail leading between the knee-high grasses. It ends to
the south and leads back north.
230232: The trees part in a natural clearing and here you see another hope of
human habitation. Cold stones ring the center as if an abandoned campfire. Yet
even these are covered with packed leaves and mossed as if from many seasons
ago; perhaps even they are a natural formation. The trees yield an opening to
the southwest, and high above the sun breaks through a single cloud in an
otherwise crystal-blue sky.
230464: These sit in a lonely circle in the middle of the clearing, unevenly
spaced, covered with leaves and moss.
230524: The leaves are packed down admist the stones, apparently several
seasons old.
230572: This grows a light green upon the stones.
230600: The decaying leaves fueled with moss smells faintly like mulch.
230640: It leads between the trees to the southwest.
230668: It is a single white fluffy cloud riven by sunlight.
230700: It is far out of reach.
230716: The slopes are much too treacherous to climb.
230744: Just beyond the trees and at the foot of a small hill, you find the
most unusual structure -- an ornate wooden device, shaped much like a crossbow
the size of a human. It is missing any drawstring, but ends in slight wooden
bowls on either side. Its centerpiece is a long wooden piece with a slot down
the center a hand wide. The ground ascends quickly in all directions into
rocky, unclimbable slopes except from whence you came.
230992: Rocky slopes ascend in all directions except to the northeast.
231028: An integral part of the structure, this bowl sits on the left side of
the structure, lifted into the air by the bowing of the crosspiece.
231104: An integral part of the structure, this bowl sits on the right side of
the structure, lifted into the air by the bowing of the crosspiece.
231180: A long horizontal slot the width of your hand set into the haft of the
structure.
231228: Strangely, it doesn't seem to fit.
231252: A new path opens up before you, wending through the trees. It arcs
slightly downward and pauses on the lip of tall hill, from where you can see
the valley unfolding below in all the glory of summer.
231360: Far below, nestled in the crook of the valley, a stream curls. Beside
it stands a majestic stone castle, ringed by a spiked wooden perimeter. The
pennons rustle in the breeze, fluttering jade and gold.
231484: The same breeze, crisp and clear and pregnant with the timeless
evocation of youth, fills your nostrils as though life itself had been breathed
back into you. Your eyes clear; you feel strong and in a moment, resolute. It
is then that you notice the chirp of insects in a pleasant on-again off-again
twitter, the caroling of birds to birds and the shy glances of foxes in the
underbrush.
231712: The wind ruffles your hair and you can hear without hearing the words,
"And to some it shall be given..." and you step foot on to the path, down the
hill, towards the castle in the distance.
231824: It is a thick, glue-bound college-rule notebook. Its covers are
simulated marble in color and cardboard in construction.
231900: Though there are no identifying marks on the marble-toned notebook, it
feels oddly familiar in your hand.
231964: You are quickly bored and overwhelmed by the details of accounting
life, yet oddly disturbed and justified by the piercing marginalia.
232046: The notebook turns several pages unassisted and a shimmery glittery
substance arises in a fountain-like plume. As the scintillating mist falls, the
world around you changes.
232156: It is summer outside -- that you can see through the large bay window
set into the wall. Such a beautiful day; such a beautiful day even to die, you
think morosely, fidgeting in the uncomfortable guest chair. Just take a running
start and crash through that window, to splatter yourself all over the cars
below. "What a proper mess," they'd say. "Cleaning blood from paint is so
expensive."
232390: Still, the depressive fantasies don't take the edge off the swirling
anxiety and pinned-down helplessness that you feel. In a cold sweat, you know
the battle to be is hopeless. And history has taught you that innocence is no
defense.
232538: Your trial begins with a reading of accusations. Like an inquisitor,
she reads out item after item and disallows any defense. As the minutes grind
onward, you realize that this is a show trial. Your sentence has already been
determined; the conclusion is foregone; you are guilty. Under her baleful eyes,
you find yourself scrawling notes of behaviors to change. Mute and numb, you
agree to all the charges levied, pick up your pad of paper and shuffle from the
office.
232824: It is only later that the anger comes. Then the visions of decking the
walls with her blood take hold.
232884: The margin notes puncture corporate culture with trenchant observations
and hint at some impending catastrophe.
232952: A well-worn mitt clasps the streetlight.
232980: It is a well-worn glove that fits your hand as though a second skin.
Scrawled down near the base is a name in faded ink, 'Dave'.
233056: The glove falls to the dirt below and a sudden wind whips up the dust
in a cloud around you. When your vision clears, you discover that you are
somewhere, somewhen else.
233154: The brilliantly-blue spring sky stretches boundlessly overhead; you can
see almost forever, with the cottony cirrus clouds in occasional daubs
summoning up in your mind cloud-kingdoms and days of summers past. It is not
summer yet, but it is close. The breeze is not cold, but cool; the sun is
bright and warm without being overbearing; the world is alive with the chatter
of insects and the cry of the crowd, gathered for today's baseball game.
233422: You crouch in the outfield, glove sprawled over your left hand, tensed
as the pitches are thrown. The crack of a bat instantly hushes the world and
your eyes rivet to the ball, headed your way. You take a few steps backwards,
then a few more, and then tumble over some odd outcrop. The ball plummets and
you turn on your side, laying out your glove for a graceful catch. You stumble
to your feet and hurl the ball inwards as the crowd gasps, cheers, and shouts
your name.
233700: The rest of game proceeds is a blur of doubles, stolen bases, bright
sun and watered-down Gatorade, and a close finish worthy of any baseball
tournament. Three things settle down into your heart: the honest smiles upon
the faces of your teammates, the sense of easy camaraderie that charges the
air, and that mysterious outcropping.
233904: The faded black ink is in a cramped hand. It reads simply, 'Dave'.
233948: A wooden chest with bronze bands is buried here, only its lid visible.
233992: The chest is wooden with bronze supporting bands criss-crossing its top
and sides. Ruggedly built and quite heavy, it is almost completely buried.
Newly-turned dirt lies around it.
234104: The chest is wooden with bronze supporting bands criss-crossing its top
and sides. Ruggedly built and quite heavy, it seems somehow out-of-place.
234196: The canoe cannot carry that much weight.
234220: You cannot empty something that is not open.
234244: As your hands grasp the side of the chest, you feel strangely guilty
and cannot continue.
234296: The chest divulges its contents after some coaxing; although not
locked, it has succumbed to the rust and tarnish of age. The lid creaks open
and air escapes anew into the world, redolent with gun oil, mud, and blood.
Frissons of distant familiarity flash instantly through your frame.
234464: You have a fleeting vision of a downpour, and a man stripping off his
uniform, his sabre, his rifle, and burying them inside a chest. Whether to
forget or whether so that others might remember, you cannot be sure. As he
walks away down a muddy dirt road, the image fades.
234626: The soldier gives a wry grin and says, "Couldn't help yourself,
couldya?"
234682: The soldier takes a long draught of air as though it were a favorite
wine. He sits down on some invisible stump and lays his musket aside on the
wispy ground.
234776: "Someone's remembered. All our blood wasn't for nothing, even with the
way everything became."
234840: "It's not how we wanted it, but you know that."
234874: He takes a long, hard, look at you. "You're an old soul," he says at
last. "And like me, you don't belong."
234952: He stands up, gathers his musket and something else which you cannot
quite make out. "Now I can rest and I thank you kindly for that. Here," he
says, flipping down that object, scintillating in its flight, "Use it when you
need to reflect." He laughs a coarse, raw laugh. "I won't be needin' it where
I'm a-goin." He kneels and crosses himself, stands, and then walks away, fading
with every step.
235256: A tattered uniform dotted with precious few snaps and buckles. It seems
altogether threadbare and barely holding together. You have the impression that
touching it would cause it to crumble.
235368: A well-kept sabre apparently belonging to a high-ranking officer in a
forgotten army.
235424: Hesitating in guilt, you decide to not touch any more of the items in
the chest.
235472: Hesitating in guilt, you decide to not touch any more of the items in
the chest.
235520: It is a faded violet, spiky and soft ball. The rubbery bristles soon
give way to a shifting, gelatinous center that feels oddly soothing when you
squeeze it.
235616: Squeezing the koosh ball relaxes you somewhat, but not enough to make
being here palatable.
235668: Nervously, you squeeze and unsqueeze your hands around the koosh ball.
235708: You feel oddly relaxed and blissful.
235732: You're about as relaxed as you're going to get.
235764: The ball bounces about as well as you do, which is to say, poorly. It
makes a 'squork' sound as it hits and thereafter remains motionless.
Disappointed, you pick it back up.
235870: The ball makes a soft 'plonk' sound as you successfully hit yourself in
the forehead with it.
235928: and hits it hard. Nothing results from the impact, though.
235964: and hits them hard. Nothing results from the impact, though.
235998: A flame-like spiral wends up from around the ball and as you peer
closer, the violet strands swirl around you, revealing images and words of
another time.
236088: This is it. 

Your first real job. A job to dress up for. A job with a
future. The real deal.
236154: You stand there, looking up at the massive building before you, at once
awed by its sheer presence and silently seduced by the power and responsibility
that radiate from it. The guide stops to gather the group together and passes
out koosh balls to everyone. Then she swivels on her black pumps and leads you
down the concrete sidewalk around the building.
236358: It is spring, not humid yet, and the winds, part-cool and part-warm
rustle through the grasses around you as if welcoming you in to a new world. A
guy next to you pretends to aim the koosh ball at the tour guide. You laugh and
your heart fills with a secret happiness. The click-clack of dress shoes and
the low murmur of the other new hires fills the air; you are part of them; you
belong. A smile breaks out across your face like a kid receiving a triple-scoop
of ice cream -- big, broad, wide-eyed. Today is going to be the first day in a
long string of good days, you tell yourself.
236704: This is now a rusted hunk of plastic and bent metal. From its dials and
faded numbered display, you can tell that it was once near the sun.
236788: A brand-new radio crouches here, its dials gleaming and digital display
flashing. While obviously mid-line popular electronics, it is plenty loud.
236884: A rusted scrap radio lurks on the desk.
236908: A wide gleaming radio crouches on the desk.
236934: You lose yourself in the music for a while.
236964: You lose yourself in the music for a while.
236988: timelessly electric chords fused with words, "Those were the best days
of my life -- the summer of sixty-nine..."
237096: the hard rock beat of "Barracuda".
237124: a plaintive gothic synth dirge that echoes, "You take my tears and
that's not fair. It's tainted love..."
237240: As you touch the radio, the world around you shimmers and shifts as
though you were walking through curtains of blurry light, gradually sharpening.
When you can focus your eyes again, you see that your surroundings have
changed.
237368: You lean upwards, stretching to discern the hushed words tumbling from
the small steel grate.
237420: One voice is husky, confident, and almost overbearing. The other is
sniveling and slick -- the tyrant and the unctuous genius -- both male and
dangerous in different ways. Their voices set off distinct tremors of revulsion
and fear.
237564: "When will we reach critical mass?" demands the strong man.
237698: "I talked to Jack and Stephanie. They're in. They'll supply us with
TechHire people."
237762: "The best. Now how about the process? Have you had any more
difficulties?"
237816: More silence. "I haven't been able to eliminate the possibility of host
rejection completely."
237880: "We cannot afford another Johnson. You know that."
238094: "The cams and pistons lock up occasionally. I'm ordering new parts from
a supplier in Korea."
238158: The husky man laughs darkly. "I'll see you tomorrow."
238198: You can't bear to hear any more. Your mind races with anxious concern
and you want nothing else than to be out of this part of the building. You
clamber down to get away from the vent.
238304: You hear nothing further from the vent.
238324: You hear faint voices emanating from the vent, but you're not close
enough to understand what they're saying.
238388: You hear faint voices emanating from the vent, but you're not close
enough to understand what they're saying.
238452: You hear faint voices talking from far away; the voices steal down
through the vent.
238500: It is a two-inch by four-inch air-conditioning vent is set high up in
the ceiling, in the wall abutted by the desk. You hear sibilant sounds
emanating from the vent.
238592: It is a two-inch by four-inch air-conditioning vent is set high up in
the ceiling, in the wall abutted by the desk.
238660: The vent is too far away for you to see anything.
238692: The vent is much too small for you to enter.
238720: The vent is set in the ceiling, too far away for you to reach.
238756: A slightly-burnished golden engagement ring. It is a narrow band of
gold with a celtic knot on the underside.
238824: You tug at the ring, but find that it will not budge. It glimmers
motionless around your ring finger, for better or for worse.
238928: At first it feels faintly scratchy on your finger, but then you become
accustomed to it as if it belonged there.
238994: The gold ring closes in on your finger and seeps into your skin. You
catch your breath in a second of piercing pain, and you see that where the ring
once was, now there is a decorated little band of bruises, like hatch-marks,
like a chain of briars around your finger, beautiful in decoration, throbbing
in a dull, distant ache.
239186: You peer into the burned out husk of a campfire, and you see a tiny
light, like a firefly, winking on from a great distance away. Gradually it
grows into the flickering flames of a campfire, perhaps this one, perhaps
another one. The air seems suddenly thin and then images swirl around within
the fire.
239362: A collage of nights and days fly by as if in fast-motion video; a young
man crouches around the campfire with a brunette woman with shoulder-length
hair. Together, they cuddle; they embrace; they kiss by the fire. Then they are
building the campfire for the first time, and then the young man sits alone by
the fire. The wood hisses as he dumps the dark river water upon its smouldering
remains. He stands and kicks sand into it, defeatedly, and before he leaves, he
hurls a shiny, tiny object into the center of the charred wood.
239674: The image fades, growing smaller and smaller into the burned-out
campfire until it has vanished entirely and the world is once again cold and
lonely around you. Somehow, you feel as though you had aged a year in only
moments; sorrow chokes your lungs and you taste bitterness in the wind.
239848: You notice a glinting emanating from the center of the burned out
campfire that you had not noticed before. Brushing away ash, you discover a
thin, golden engagement ring.
239952: As you look into the mirror, it fogs over and you see a younger version
of yourself writing a word upon the steamed-up mirror, "yawhgih". Your
reflection wipes away the word as the image fades.
240068: It is a simple, silver-backed hand mirror. You see yourself in it,
haggard and run-down.
240124: Standing here on the edge of civilization, at the intersection of
emptiness and loneliness, you feel the warmth of familiarity accompanying those
emotions. But not just now, like the heaviness that seems omnipresent, but long
ago as well.
240264: Looking out into the shadows, your unfocussed stare is interrupted by a
glinting from below. The mirror is shimmering and as you look closer, a
familiar face swirls into shape before your eyes. It is you, but not the you of
today. It is yesterday's youth, heart just growing heavy with the cares of the
world. As you brush your fingers against the mirror in amazed sympathetic
reflection, the world swirls around you as if suddenly bathed in steam.
240520: You're not sure what day it is, except that it's not Friday. You wipe
the steamy condensation away from the mirror and look at yourself. Sullen,
angry eyes stare back at, surrounded by the haggard three-day's stubble of a
haggard man, lines betraying the defiant, yet worn-down look of someone who has
fought and lost.
240710: And in a sudden, awful breath, you realize that you had lost. There was
a reason behind the constant struggling, the inability to succeed, the
withering of friendships, the snubs, behind it all. You lean up against the
mirror, supporting yourself in a dark epiphany.
240874: Whatever implant was necessary to be a corporate drone hadn't taken in
you. You had fought off the secret surgery. You had failed to conform. That was
your failure, but on a grander scale, you were one of the few victors.
241010: Then you remember laughing, thinking just how impossible such a thing
was. But even the laughter didn't provide its customary cleansing. You were a
hunted man, and the idea of something wicked and inhuman became over days, less
and less a fantasia and increasingly a secret hypothesis.
241188: A leather-bound book with silvered pages, printed some time ago. Its
title reads, "Asceticism in the Life of the Believer" by A.W. Tolson.
241278: You notice a well-read leather-bound book on the bookshelf.
241316: The words seem to come alive as you read them, in an instant dragging
you from the beginning of time to its sure, glorious end. Desert truths, lonely
voices, and rare pleasures steep your soul. At once, you are crushed by the
turning, burning desire to change and the impossibility of that task unaided.
241496: You read the words and they summon up once more, though faintly this
time, the turning, burning desire to change and the impossibility of that task
under your own strength.
241596: You open the book and notice that inscribed on the front cover are the
words, 'From Beverly Johnson to my beloved son, Sam.' You close the book,
pondering the meaning of this.
241698: Somehow, you know that you've always known that, but it didn't seem
important until just now. Yet, those words touch off an elision of fear, dread,
regret, and anger that makes you want to scream like a beast and curl into a
ball.
241844: Now you remember it all. You had watched the ambulance pull up on
Corporate way; you had looked out the window at the gathering crowd; the hushed
whispers reached you that it was someone who had worked here and someone
important at that.
241990: When you had heard who it was, your blood ran cold, as frigid as arctic
ice. He was the one whom let you borrow his book. He was the one whose office
you had stumbled into the day of the corporate picnic. And, he, like you, was a
rebel. Though his rebellion was on a level you hadn't yet reached, you felt. It
was more sublime, yet forceful. It was a marshalling of civilization and all
its mighty spokesmen against the tiny tyrannies of the dead world around you.
And yet it somehow transcended the world.
242294: The implantation had failed there, too. You curled into a ball in your
chair, glancing at the newspaper clippings you had amassed. He was too much of
a threat. Would you be thought of as much? You rocked back and forth, torn
apart by dogs within.
242444: If you told anyone what you knew, you would meet a similar fate. Yet
what were your chances outside the building? They had already cranked up the
rumor mill against others, rendering them unemployable. What could you do? Keep
the awful secrets and work here in perpetuity as a slave?
242616: Your fingers are pulled towards the book as if it were urging you to
partake of its contents.
242744: It is a simple ball of a gold-colored substance, like faded sunlight.
It pulses light like a beating heart.
242808: It is a simple ball of a gold-colored substance, like faded sunlight.
It shines bright as the morning sun.
242870: As you look into the sphere, you feel time and space distend and in a
heartbeat, you are elsewhere.
242930: He leans close to you and whispers, "They're killing me in here."
242974: All around him, people laugh and chatter idly. An annoying mist, like
static swirls around you and obscures your vision. No-one notices what he had
just said; someone asks about the party next Tuesday; someone complains about
their shoes.
243126: Then it is early morning. You can see row after row of people file into
their cubes like robots. Within seconds of one another, they sit down, turn on
their computers, adjust their seats. The stopwatch, assembly-line synchrony
laces the air with poisonous unease. Day after day, this scene repeats, with
the actors, fading, decaying; one day a man falls down and when he gets back
up, you hear the click-swivel-whir of machinery. It is the man who whispered to
you, initially. He looks up at you with his head crooked at an impossible angle
and says, "What's wrong with you?"
243482: Nearby, someone stops to look him over and grows concerned when he
notices what you have seen. From down the hall echoes the unmistakable abrasive
snarl of a female authority figure. Burly security guards appear. As the
androids are all walking one way, the security guards carry the man backwards
against the flow of the crowd, back into the darkness.
243696: You want to do something, but you are trapped behind an invisible wall
somewhere -- you are a ghost -- you look down and see right through your hands;
as the vision fades, you look down at your hands again, softly tracing the
veins. You are not completely sure that they are as solid as they were before.
243880: The gold sphere glows even brighter than before and visions dance
across its surface.
243932: It is a simple ball of a gold-colored substance, like faded sunlight.
It seems to bob in your hand and radiates a bright, cheery light.
244012: You pick your way cautiously through the darkness.
244040: You feel your way around and keep going.
244062: You feel the shadows weighing on you, as if by their dodging motions
they could extinguish the last light in the building.
244130: Eerie and faintly sinister, the room appears without the drone of
fluorescent light.
244184: A grey-cloaked, withered but surprisingly spry man emerges from the
shadows. He nods at you and steals across the floor to the control panel. He
reaches inside and heaves a breaker forward. From down below you hear the
sounds of generators whirring back to life and machinery, perhaps infernal
machinery, returning back to full speed. The harsh fluorescent lights flicker
on and the blue emergency lights fade out.
244428: He looks at you curiously and then hurries away, as if fearing
contamination from the air itself.
244484: He goes to leave and then stops, asking you softly, 'Have you found it
yet?' Before you can answer, he is gone.
244556: From far away and below you hear the sounds of generators whirring back
to life and machinery, perhaps infernal machinery, returning back to full
speed. The harsh fluorescent lights flicker back to life.
244678: From far away and below you hear the sounds of generators whirring back
to life and machinery, perhaps infernal machinery, returning back to full
speed. Light flickers inside the building and for a moment, it looks like a
thousand enchained spirits were escaping before the fluorescent lights once
again give the building the appearance of a baleful dragon with shimmering
scales like gasoline lights.
244914: From far away, you hear the sounds of generators whirring back to life
and the distant thunder of machinery. A transitory glow comes from the
direction of the building.
245012: A moment later, the inhabitant slides past you and resumes sitting in
his chair, but not before shaking his head.
245082: A man shrouded in a grey cloak slides past you to take a seat. He
shakes his head wearily, and then with a knowing expression, turns to face you.
245304: You can barely make out your fingers in the dim light. You decide not
to risk further exploration in such uncertain conditions.
245374: The darkness looms around you, threateningly.
245402: It is dark and the world around you, utterly unknown.
245432: experience points. Your certainty is
245458: Now the lightning dances over the wood, perhaps more frenetically than
before; perhaps the humming takes on a slight bit of resonance; looking back
you could not really state for certain, but slowly, you remember the sound of
distant thunder gradually approaching, drawing inexorably near until at once an
immense circular shaft of light shot up from the wooden structure and the
thunder crashed upon you.
245698: Then it was raining; particles of light fell from the sky, tiny flaked
bits of dancing light that melted within seconds of touching you. Like a
flurry, they drifted lazily over you for several minutes and then ceased. The
spheres were gone. As you looked around, trying to fit everything into place,
you felt strangely light. The past you found the way that children remember
early birthdays, something safely far away and unable to harm you now.
245962: An exchange had been made -- your past for a different past -- a burden
of shame and hurt woven through with blood and disgust for a path back to life.
Now the gateway back was closed, and you found more than relief, but a secret
joy as well.
246112: That is what you remember after drawing your knees to your chest and
thinking, simply sitting alone by the odd wooden structure and breathing
slowly, in and out, as if remembering how to breathe after years of forgetting.
246248: It begins -- the beating; mechanised fists and arms and legs strike at
you from the shadows and you fall down into a stupor. You seem to remember the
robotic entities then scattering and someone carrying you, but even those seem
like dreams when you awake, sore, damp with sweaty fright, but more or less
unharmed.
246438: It begins -- the beating; mechanised fists and arms and legs strike at
you from the shadows vehemently. "We told you," they hiss as sunbursts of pain
explode across your vision. "No-one will save you now." Mercifully, you soon
lose all capacity to feel and hurtle headlong into death.
246622: Instantly all light vanishes and a feeling like struggling beneath a
sodden blanket overtakes you. You can see, murkily, as if through the eyes of a
thin blindfold; sounds of a high-pitched beam shutting on and off strike you as
if scanning you; you hear the susurrus of many voices, and the sounds of
hydraulic cams and pistons turning, firing. An voice echoes, 'Still,' and the
murkiness lifts.
247004: You blink your eyes and look up at the flickering monitor, looking busy
with desultory ease. Yet as your eyes flick across rows of numbers, you cannot
forget the dream-like sensation of that other world; even the gossipy
chattering that spirals up from the other cube; even the squeal of the oaken
door as it is opened and shut repeatedly; even these cannot drive away the
heavy sense of fantasia. But as you reach to remember details, to discern where
you were, what you experienced flees from you, and an inescapable sorrow seeps
down into your lungs in its stead. Breathing as if futilely, you know, in the
secret corners of your heart, that your one last hope of being freed is forever
lost.
247412: You are wearing a leaden overcoat stumbling down a hallway filled with
strobe lights. Anxiety runs like an electric wire through your frame as you can
feel the eyes upon you; eyes, forever-staring; eyes boring holes through your
back; eyes peering out from translucent drawer-like plates in the hall. You
hold your breath hoping somehow to black out, but the floor melts and the scene
shifts. 

You are running down an endless plain on a moonless night, where the
stars sit in judgement like needles waiting to fall upon you. It rains clocks
and they pelt you as you run, dodging shattered stopwatches and blaring alarm
clocks. The scene shifts again. 

Every action seems in slow-motion as though
you were moving through time. You raise your head to look in the mirror and see
yourself growing older, a year for every moment. You turn away and look back to
see a skeleton staring back at you, its jaws gibbering madly. 

Then you are
sleeping. A gentle touch upon your shoulder and you awake, blinking into focus
a strange and yet uncannily familiar world. The abandoned parking lot and the
broken streets keen with secrets just out of reach. Before you is the building.
It lurks like a coiled dragon, a summation of fear and deadly challenge, of
past and of present. You hear a final distant voice that seems a greeting as
well as benediction, "This is the dark night of the soul."
248232: You hear the faint echo of a muffled knock.
248260: You must untie something which can be tied.
248288: You can't see well enough to sit down.
248312: You're on or in something else right now.
248336: As you stand, you start to lose your balance and swiftly sit back down.
248376: You hear the faint hum of fluorescent lights, but nothing more.
248412: You hear the faint hum of fluorescent lights in the background.
248448: You hear nothing but the scrape of your shoes against rock and your
ragged breath.
248496: You hear the gentle rustling of the wind.
248520: You hear the low of the mourning wind, but nothing more.
248552: You remember the past now like the vestiges of a dream; you understand
it from beginning until end and are thankful, for it has brought you here. But
it has no power over you, now and holds no secret fear.
248674: You close your eyes and focus, thinking of the hours and the days gone
past.
248720: You remember shattered, fragmented memories of a life lived in a large
building under harsh lights; parking lots, monitors, numbers all flit across
your mind, but abstractly and murkily as through a veil. They all seem blunted
from emotion, indistinct and so distant, it is as if they belonged to someone
else.
248902: Yet some pieces take on more detail as you think back:
248968: There is no ground to dig in here.
248988: You find it quite difficult without using some kind of digging
apparatus.
249032: You make a few small piles of upturned earth but discover nothing of
interest.
249080: You recognize a hopeless task when you see one.
249112: You spin around, feeling faintly nauseous.
249136: You do not see anything here to wade in.
249160: You would not become any cleaner in that water.
249188: You do not see any water here in which to wash.
249216: You find yourself acrobatically challenged.
249244: "I'd know that perfume anywhere."
249268: You spin around but do not catch sight of anything; it as though some
presence were stalking you, something indistinct and incorporeal.
249348: You turn around, but see no-one there.
249372: You have been playing for 1 turn.
249396: You need to be in the canoe, first.
249468: You don't see anything nearby to swim in.
249496: [ You've discovered a verb that the game does not recognize. If you're
frustrated, look for common verbs in the general IF help menu by tying 'help'.
]
249628: You don't see any such thing here.
249684: You don't see any such thing here.
249708: You find it just another part of the fractured landscape, possessing no
inherent fascination in and of itself, and as a result, leave it undisturbed.
249792: That's just scenery.
249808: It's not entirely clear what you intend.
249836: You see nothing unexpected in that direction.
249860: You dance a little jig of despair.
250168: give" or test "has" or "hasnt" with a non-attribute on the object
250212: , but it is longer than 2 bytes so you cannot use "."
