53738: Sitting atop a small white picket fence, you watch the children play in
their backyard. Behind you, is old Mr. Harkin's place, an odd place, with an
odd owner. What evil might we do today? As the Devil himself, you never tire of
creating havoc amongst the little souls of the world. The more innocent the
victim, well, all the more satisfying.
53988: Sitting on top of a white picket fence, you can see several children
playing in a backyard, and a larger yard behind you. You can get 'down' anytime
you wish.
54100: The children's yard is small with a slide in the middle.
54140: All of a sudden the children's mother appears. "Alright kids, just
remember, you musn't ever go into that yard next door. I'm watching you from
the window, so just stay put," and she disappears into the house.

And with
that, your plan is set. Entice one or both of the little rugrats into Mr.
Harkin's backyard.
54368: You try to examine the little yard but the there is no refuge. The grass
is perfect, not a single weed. The bushes and flowers are the work of a true
gardener. The ladder and slide are constructed of the finest materials and
workmanship. It all makes you want to run. But you can't pass up the
opportunity to bedazzle these two innocent souls.
54608: The fence is of the sickeningly white, picket variety. The goodness that
eminates from the craftmanship turns your already fiery insides into a flaming
boil.
54716: You double over. The house is simply pure goodness. You feel lucky to be
able to be so near such a perfect example of everything good in the world and
still try to spread evil.
54840: Nothing like cement to calm the nerves and the stomach. Inert, dead,
lifeless, souless rock. The next best thing to fire and brimstone.
54936: There are two children. A small boy about 4 years old and a slightly
bigger girl, probably about 6 years old.
55016: He's a cute little monster. Nothing makes your skin crawl more than a
cute little boy having fun. You do a check on his soul, just to make sure, and
recoil from the overwhelming goodness within.
55152: The little boy eats a pez candy, one after another and like a vulture on
a dead herd of buffalo, you pounce, increasing his hunger and thus, his
gluttony.
55260: The little boy shares pez with his sister, then throws it over the
fence.
55312: The little boy climbs the ladder of a slide and yells as he swiftly
glides back to earth.
55374: The little boy falls down, giggles, and gets back up.
55416: The little boy chases his sister.
55442: The little boy looks at the fence, knowing he's not supposed even think
about going into the other yard.
55520: She's pretty, calm, happy, and loves her little brother. A migraine
begins to grow as you focus on her. The piety of her soul enrages you to no
end.
55626: Overwhelmed by the Devil's play, the two children slowly and quietly
edge towards the opening in Mr. Harkin's Fence.
55716: The children's mom comes out to scold them, but the little gnome catches
her eye and she stops a moment to admire it. In that instant, you pounce,
filling her with all of the sins her children have already suffered. The
children successfully sneak into Mr. Harkin's yard, thus breaking their
mother's rules, and creating a never-ending cycle of devilish behaviour. Your
task complete, you pop out of the yard and move on to other evil doings.
56028: The children's mom comes out to scold them just in time. They sheepishly
drop the things they were holding and sulk into the house, with their mother
behind. Eventually, her discipline heals the wounds of your devilish behaviour,
leaving you without any success in this backyard.
56224: Eventually the little girl notices her little brother eating candy after
candy while trying to hide the Pez dispenser from her. She tries to grab it
from him, but it accidently flips out of both of their hands into Mr. Harkin's
yard. They look at each other, accusingly, thus adding wrath to their list of
sins.
56442: The little girl climbs the ladder of a slide and runs down, jumping to
the ground.

"I saw that young lady," her mom yells from the house.
56544: The little girl skips around the yard, singing to herself.
56586: The little girl runs from her brother.
56616: The little girl looks at the house, wondering if their mother is paying
attention.
56676: It's a very small and sturdy little ladder and slide. The kids are
taking turns on it.
56740: It's a wonderful, large, filthy yard with all kinds of sharp tools,
dangerous machinery, and broken glass laying about. A child could get into a
lot of trouble in that yard. It is exactly the type of place that soothes your
temper and fills you with peace.
56920: They're old and dangerous tools. Exactly the type you'd have yourself.
56972: The igauna slithers through the fence, but not before the little boy
chases after him. Missing the iguana by a tail, the little boy yelps and
notices a small opening through the fence.

As he peers through the opening, a
spark of curiosity fills the little boy and with a small nudge, you increase
his level of envy (for the iguana's location on the other side of the fence).
57232: The little boy reaches for the pez dispenser and grabs it. You wave your
hand and the candy becomes irresistable.
57316: The little boy notices the pez, but seems afraid to reach through the
opening and leaves the pez behind.
57388: The boy pounces on the iguana, holding it tightly in his hands. The
lizard looks at you angrily and sticks its tongue out at you. The little boy
shows his sister. They take it to the edge of the yard and release it into some
trees.
57548: The girl suddenly notices the green yo-yo and quickly picks it up,
hiding it for no apparent reason, from her brother. As quick as lightning, you
fill the little girl with fear and her reaction is to covet the yo-yo,
increasing her level of avarice. The feelings are so strong, they invade the
little boy too.
57764: The little girl picks up the yo-yo and plays with it. After a few
moments, she shares it with her little brother.
57848: It's your standard toolkit for the evil.
57880: A cool glow in-the-dark green yo-yo. A picture of an imp adorns each
side.
57936: It a small statue of a fictional character with a red hat and beard.
You've been trying to get rid of it for a millenium.
58020: It's a creature you're terribly fascinated with, although it has a habit
of eating underwear. Never have found a use for it. It looks at you with those
beady little eyes and flicks a forked tongue out. You catch hold of the tongue
for a moment, see the animal squirm, then let go and mutter, "Simple
pleasures," to yourself.
58248: A perfect small kernel ear of white corn.
58280: It's a small toy robot duck you made a long time ago. It's helped you
nab many a soul and is one of your most prized possesions.
58372: It's a simple toy, with an unlimited supply of candy.
58412: It's a small tart candy.
58430: You eat one of the candies and get dizzy from the sweetness. Magically,
another candy appears in the pez dispenser.
58514: The little boy eats one of the candies.
58546: The little girl eats one of the candies.
58580: A man runs passed you being chased by lions and a blonde-haired man. You
think to yourself, "Isn't that my little protege Karl? How wonderful!!!"
