40135: Futile.
40142: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
40191: You talk to yourself a while.
40214: This provokes no reaction.
40242: There is no reply.
40262: Nothing is on sale.
40308: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
40346: Time passes.
40362: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
40439: You are standing on a fairly long, straight platform east of a train. A
flight of stairs marked "Exit" leads up. The train doors are open.
40540: You are standing on a fairly long, straight platform east of an empty
track, and at the bottom of a flight of stairs marked "Exit". Hanging from the
ceiling is a large electric sign.
40678: Don't be silly -- you'd get electrocuted.
40756: The tramp returns from his journey looking irritated. "Friggin'
chocolate machine!" he mutters under his breath.
40873: "For the next train, please go to platform two immediately."
40929: "This train is now ready to depart."
40958: "Next train: platform two."
40988: The sign is too high up to reach.
41025: No fear.
41034: You daren't go near the pile of clothes for fear of catching lice from
them.
41095: It's an old and tattered trilby, with several holes in it.
41141: It's an old and tattered trilby, with several coins in it.
41206: As you approach the hat, a grimy hand emerges from the pile of clothes
to stop you. You withdraw in disgust and realise that what you had taken for a
heap of dirty laundry is in fact a tramp.
41349: You have a sneaking suspicion that as soon as you drop the trilby, the
tramp will claim it back, so you don't.
41445: you can't just take that hat -- I couldn't make a living without it.
Tell you what, though. It's yours for a pound."
41552: "Sod off!" says the tramp rudely. "I don't want that."
41612: A bad idea, considering that the hat has holes in it.
41683: You can't afford it.
41729: The tramp doesn't appreciate your interest in his money. He gives you a
hard stare.
41803: The tramp looks at you if he has just been insulted, opens his mouth to
speak, but then thinks better of it. He's not the talkative type.
41905: Really, how could you think of attacking a poor defenceless tramp?
41957: You can't bring yourself to do it.
41989: The tramp gives you a hard, threatening stare, and you think better of
it.
42056: "Get away! That's hardly worth anything."
42096: "Not after you've 'ad your sticky fingers on it!"
42152: "So you're after me hat are you? I've grown rather attached to it over
the years. Let me 'ave a look."
42243: The tramp pulls a large carpet bag out from the folds of his coat.
42302: He forages in the bag, pulls out a battered cap, and hands if to you.
"You can have this one though," he says, taking your pound.
42405: The tramp fumbles with the zip on his bag. "Friggin' zip! You'd better
have this trilby," he says sadly, snatching the pound. As he gives you the hat,
the coins inside fall through a large hole in the bottom and into his hand.
42620: He pretends not to be interested, but you can tell he wants your money.
42747: The tramp reaches inside his coat, produces his mouth-organ and puts it
to his lips. The fat woman with the shopping runs up to him, but is dismayed to
see that his hat is gone. Although she pleads with him, the tramp starts to
play, and the unbearable sound causes a riot on the platform, with the dual
effect of delaying the next train to arrive for several minutes, and causing
you to be knocked unconscious.
43044: The tramp reaches inside his coat and produces a mouth-organ which he
makes as if to play. Just as it reaches his lips, a fat woman carrying a
Sainsbury's bag runs up to him with a look of extreme worry, saying "No, no!
I'd give anything to stop you playing." She sees the hat, drops a coin into it
and runs off. The tramp smiles, takes the hat and the money and goes off to buy
a bar of chocolate.
43346: Although it's open, you can't see into the dank interior.
43392: The bag is zipped shut.
43422: You can't -- you broke the zip.
43450: But the carpet bag is already open.
43488: But the bag is already closed!
43519: "Take yer hands off my bag!"
43545: You struggle with the rusty zip, and manage to close the bag, but the
fastener breaks as you do so.
43649: dhnI'm afraid I can't allow you to do that -- I'm sure the tramp
wouldn't approve. You know he doesn't like people looking into his bag.
43759: Part of the zip has snapped off, making the bag impossible to open.
43811: The zip has almost had it -- one more use and it could easily break.
43949: A thin, eccentric looking man approaches you furtively. "I'll give you a
fiver for that hat. How about it?"
44144: The man looks surprised and annoyed. He walks off in a huff.
44219: The tramp pushes past you, grumbling to himself, and walks off towards
platform one.
44297: "For the next train, please go to platform one immediately."
44353: "BUG! YOU SHOULDN'T EVER SEE THIS!"
44398: "Next train: platform one."
44428: The sign is too high up to reach.
44462: It's too heavy to move, and it's bolted to the wall anyway.
44739: Nothing happens.
44762: You hear muffled clanking sounds coming from inside the machine, but
there is no visible effect.
45027: The machine grunts and groans, and you hear a dull thud.
45074: The lever doesn't budge.
45121: Tantalisingly, it's just the right size for a small bar of chocolate.
45193: The tray doesn't seem to be of the movable kind. It looks more as if
things are just meant to rest on it.
45339: Ugh! It smells rotten and mouldy. Don't say I didn't warn you.
45395: Ahh! The rich aroma makes you even hungrier.
45440: As you open your mouth, an official approaches you and explains that
eating is allowed on trains, but not it in the station. You put the chocolate
away again.
45557: You stuff the delicious chocolate into your mouth. At last your hunger
has been satisfied.
45650: Touching the electrified track would be very, very stupid.
45806: You run down the stairs towards the train on platform two, but it begins
to move once you're halfway there. By the time you arrive at the platform, it
is empty.
45947: You hurry down the stairs towards the train on platform one, but it
begins to move once you're halfway there. By the time you arrive at the
platform, it is empty.
46109: The tramp shuffles in from the east, glares at you furiously as if you
alone were responsible for the broken chocolate machine, and walks away towards
platform one.
46374: The notice is firmly attached to the wall, and there's nothing you can
do about it.
46494: The barrier reaches from floor to ceiling, and you couldn't possibly get
past it.
46560: The only thing that would fit into the barrier is a ticket.
46726: The doors slide closed, and the train pulls out of the station.
46796: Bang! The train collides with something on the track, causing it to
derail. Many passengers, yourself included, are killed in the accident.
46932: From the direction of platform one you hear first the sound of a very
badly played mouth-organ, then the sound of a violent attack on a very bad
mouth-organ player. A loudspeaker crackles into life:

DUE TO THE DISTURBANCE
CAUSED IN THIS STATION, THE TRAIN STANDING AT PLATFORM ONE WILL BE DELAYED FOR
FIVE MINUTES. THANKYOU.
47329: The man prods you with his index finger. "Come on. Yes or No?
47384: c."Hurry up and make up your mind."
47419: ."Oh, forget it".
47510: To move about, use the compass directions.
47873: a,






Since losing your ticket you've been unable to get out of the
underground system; heaven knows how long you've spent wandering around.
Anyway, whether it's days or weeks, you're absolutely famished -- you simply
must find something to eat.
48240: by Richard Tucker, 1995.
First-timers should type "info".
48312: You can't go that way.
48380: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
48412: As good-looking as ever.
48456: The clothes are heaped up into a disorderly mound.
48496: Just a few coppers.
48512: The tramp is almost buried by a heap of torn and filthy clothing.
48560: The cap seems to be a series of holes, held together by wool and
dandruff. At one time it might have been tweed.
48640: It's a carpet bag with a rusty zip fastening and it looks full. Full of
what you dare not speculate.
48712: You are on a platform west of a slightly curved and empty track. Stairs
marked "Exit" lead up and out, and an electric sign is hanging from the
ceiling. Against the wall stands an old vending machine.
48852: Don't be stupid -- you'd get electrocuted.
48884: The machine is so old that the instructions have been worn away. On the
front panel are a narrow slot, a lever, and a dispensing tray.
49040: The lever is embossed with a circle, and the word "PULL"
49084: It's exactly like any other penny you've ever seen.
49148: Of course, it's not legal tender any more, but then again it had
probably been in that chocolate machine for years.
49228: The corners are worn, and Sir Isaac's face is dirty, but it's worth a
pound, and that's not to be sniffed at.
49308: It's a small bar of "Fruit and Nut" chocolate, and it comes conveniently
without any form of wrapping, to allow you to eat it quickly and to reduce
litter.
49420: The electrified track provides power for the trains. It's high voltage
and extremely dangerous.
49488: You're in a short corridor south of the ticket hall. Two stairways lead
down; one to the west for platform one, the other to the east for platform two.
A small notice is attached to the wall.
49624: Which way down, east or west?
49646: The notice reads:

ANYONE BEHAVING IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CAUSE A PUBLIC
DISTURBANCE RISKS DELAYING THE TRAINS. ALL SUCH OFFENDERS ARE LIABLE TO BE
PROSECUTED.
49832: This is a circular room from which a corridor leads off to the south. An
automatic barrier blocks the way north.
49912: Your attempts to bulldoze your way through the barrier are unsuccessful.
49964: The barrier is ticket operated. Since you don't have a ticket, you can't
operate it.
50028: But the door is closed.
