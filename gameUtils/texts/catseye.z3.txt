3579: Don't see that.
3595: Huh?
3814: Be more specific.
5544: Can't do that.
5790: Carrying:
5843: Taken.
5878: Not portable.
5920: Carrying too much.
5945: It is.
5971: Dropped.
6015: Can't go there.
6089: Can't go there.
6303: You see:
6631: You're too small.
6708: You're too small.
6756: There is nothing in it.
6777: You're too small.
6807: It contains a blue liquid.
6840: Nothing in it.
6860: You're too small.
6898: You're too small.
6954: The cellar door is opened.
7034: You are too small to unlock it.
7056: You unlock the door.
7074: It's far too large.
7098: You're too small.
7156: find nothing. You put it back.
7192: You're too small.
7273: The door is locked.
7282: You crawl through the cat door.
7340: Nothing happens.
7363: You're too small.
7370: It's full.
7385: You don't have a jar.
7436: Nothing happens.
7467: It's already there!
8204: Can't go there.
8214: It's me!
8218: You are standing in the living room. It's actually more of
a lab than a
living room. But it does have a nice fireplace.
There is a lab bench nearby.
Exits lead off to the north, south and east.
8318: There is an ash trap here with a small hole in the center.
8346: There is a small bit of yarn sticking out of the hole.
8374: The necklace you seek is precariously positioned near the hole.
8406: Mounted on the bench is a catseye and large basin of bubbling blue
liquid.
8446: Stone with inlay of jade in the shape of a cat's eye.
8500: Small, cute and fury. You are on all fours.
8526: change coming on. Things appear larger. You drop anything you were
carrying.
8596: A beautiful necklace that belongs to your uncle.
8622: It slips down the drain. You hear it rattle for a few seconds and then
all is quiet.
8672: With your nimble paws, you tie the necklace onto the yarn.
8702: You are standing in a sitting room. There are shelves nearby.
Exit to the
south.
8742: The shelves contain many books. One such book catches your eye.
8776: The book is large and flat.
8790: The book covers the hole in the stairs.
8810: You are standing in a kitchen. There is a refrigerator nearby
and a long
counter
8842: You move the refrigerator and spot something.
8866: Your uncle uses these for drinking and to hold nails.
8898: You carefully put the jar through the cat-door.
8924: You are standing in the cellar near a large boiler.
Stairs partially
blocked by a dresser lead up.
8970: There is a vent at the bottom of the boiler.
8992: There is a spoon tied to yarn here.
9006: You are standing in the main hallway. There is a cellar
door here. Stairs
lead up. You can leave the house to the south.
9056: The cellar door is closed and locked.
9072: There is a cat door near the bottom of the frame.
9096: Your crazy uncle put the lock on the other side as he
never wanted people
to disturb him in the basement!
9160: You are standing on creaky stairs that go up and down.
9192: You are standing in a odd-shaped bedroom.
There is a loom here. Exit is
down.
9228: Aside from the odd purple color, there is some yarn in the loom.
9266: A lengthy strand.
9278: Good try. Yarn is not heavy enough.
9302: A length of yarn with a spoon tied to it.
9348: It's you.
9354: Saying your uncle Xevion is odd is an understatement. He is also
absent-minded.
But when uncle Xevion asked you to run back to his house to
retrieve his
favorite necklace, you jumped at the chance. His house is never
dull. When
you go to pick up the necklace from the mantle, it falls off into
the fireplace.
9518: It's you.
9524: You jump up and drink the blue liquid. You feel changed.
9552: As you drink, you feel a tingly sensation but nothing happens.
9588: Better not leave without uncle Xevion's necklace!
9612: With the necklace in hand, you rush to meet your uncle.

You have won
this Miniventure!
9662: You notice a hole in one of the stairs and step over it but soon run into
a dresser that you cannot pass. It seems that your uncle tried to move it into
the basement but left the job unfinished. You go back.
9774: As you go down, you reach a step with a large hole that you cannot cross.
9814: You walk over the book and squeeze past the dresser.
9842: You fill the jar with blue liquid.
9858: You tie the spoon to the end of the yarn.
9876: You drop the spoon into the ash trap of the fireplace. It rattles and
clinks, then goes quiet. The yarn is still visible here.
