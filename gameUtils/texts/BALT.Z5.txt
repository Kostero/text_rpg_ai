11748: Please give one of the answers above.
11779: It is now pitch dark in here!
11806: I beg your pardon?
11824: dxn[You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
11866: ehn[Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
11938: Sorry, that can't be corrected.
11967: Think nothing of it.
11988: "Oops" can only correct a single word.
12022: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
12073: As good-looking as ever.

again".

12185: You can't begin with a comma.

12575: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
12615: I'm not sure what "
12650: You excepted something not included anyway!
12686: You can only do that to something animate.
12721: That's not a verb I recognise.
12751: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
12805: You can't see "
12848: I didn't understand the way that finished.
12943: Nothing to do!
12960: There are none at all available!

13994: Please answer yes or no.
14020: Are you sure you want to quit?
14056: Are you sure you want to restart?

14125: Ok.
14143: Save failed.
14158: Ok.
14176: The game file has verified as intact.
14208: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupted (unless you
are playing it with a very primitive interpreter which is unable properly to
perform the test).
14338: Transcripting is already on.
14395: Transcripting is already off.
14444: Score notification on.
14465: Score notification off.

17246: is now in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gives long
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
17348: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).

17898: You find nothing of interest.
17934: But it's dark.
18025: You find nothing of interest.
19195: . Not bad.
19213: That was a rhetorical question.
19240: This dangerous act would achieve little.
19274: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
19310: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.

19644: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
19677: You would achieve nothing by this.
19706: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
19739: But there's no water here to carry.
19770: Oh, don't apologise.
19792: Real adventurers do not use such language.
19827: Quite.
19838: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
19871: There's not enough water to swim in.
19902: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
19966: You achieve nothing by this.
20054: You wave, feeling foolish.
20204: You are unable to.
20223: Nothing obvious happens.
20246: That would be less than courteous.
20284: Is that the best you can think of?
20313: That's not a direction.
20336: Not that way you can't.
20368: Keep your hands to yourself.
20393: You achieve nothing by this.
20427: Futile.
20439: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
20491: You talk to yourself a while.
20518: This provokes no reaction.
20546: There is no reply.
20565: Nothing is on sale.
20584: Your singing is abominable.
20610: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
20647: Time passes.
20662: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
41935: You're a reasonable man so you know you can't walk to Baltimore.
41994: You'd get fired if you drove your Thunderbird through the office!
42055: Your engine roars into action!
42118: You are in your V-8 Ford Thunderbird. You feel the powerful engine
idling waiting for your next move.
42195: Luxurious leather, full instrumentation. Very nice. But totally
incapable of going anywhere until you turn her over.
42292: You head south, towards and onto the New Jersey Turnpike.
42357: You're a reasonable man so you know you can't walk to Baltimore.
42414: You're a reasonable man so you know you can't walk to Baltimore.
42471: There's not very much to look at. This is Delaware after all.
42533: You're a reasonable man so you know you can't walk to Baltimore.
42590: You're a reasonable man so you know you can't walk to Baltimore.
42657: You're a reasonable man so you know you can't walk to Baltimore.
42714: You're a reasonable man so you know you can't walk to Baltimore.
42766: Baltimore! The expanse of the city is all around you. The lights, the
cars, the action that can only be found in a city.
42922: It may be late at night but there's nothing like a big city full of
millions of people to break the static schedules of sleep. Speaking of which,
you really should get some. You can't meet with your service rep until morning
and you're about ready to drop. The best thing to do now is find a decent hotel
and crash.
43155: It's good to be in Baltimore. You've visited a couple of times before
and you're always glad to be back. Baltimore may not be as attractive as Boston
or New York but it's a city nevretheless.
43304: You can't go back to New Jersey just yet. You still have to take care of
your router.
43392: Three men all armed with rather nasty weapons approach you. All at once
they deprive you of your valuables and your life. Your gut feeling was right.
This place was not safe!
43528: You can't reach the cat from inside your car.
43561: The cat hisses at you and runs a bit out of your reach.
43612: You can't reach the cat from inside your car.
43645: She warmly accepts your touch and starts to purr loudly.
43705: Hotel management would probably disapprove of you plowing through the
lobby in your car.
43775: You really should check in and get some sleep.
43825: Not so fast! You'll get to your hotel room soon enough.
43887: "Hello there. May I help you in some way?"
43929: "Good evening. You may check in whenever you're ready."
43972: The desk clerk looks slightly puzzled.
44007: I don't think the desk clerk is your type.
44043: Look, maybe you don't like the hotel but that is no excuse for violence!
44108: You leave your hotel room and find your way to...
44151: You don't have to "go" right now.
44197: Local traffic laws probably have something to say about you driving
through the promenade in your Thunderbird.
44295: "Hello, you must be Howard. Finally good to meet you after all our phone
calls."
44363: "Good morning. But I suspect that it won't be good for you until I give
you this new router I have."
44438: Robert looks at you expectantly.
44469: I don't think Robert is your type in more ways than one.
44515: Robert came here to help you. Hurting him is hurting you!
44575: You hand Robert your old router and he gives you the new one.

"I tested
your internet circuit and found a breach. I dispatched an engineer last night
to repair it. Just plug this new router in and you'll be all set."
With router
in hand you practically fly back to your office in New Jersey, breaking the
speed limit in each state you pass. You hook up the new router and the lights
begin to blink in their normal, methodical pattern.

Your callers begin to
logon and open their browsers. You have restored service. Your callers are
ecstatic and praise you on your dedication of going so far out of your way for
them, especially on a holiday.
45026: Robert doesn't seem the least bit interested.
45137: You hand Robert your old router and gives you the new one.
"I tested
your internet circuit and found a breach. I dispatched an engineer last night
to repair it. Just plug this new router in and you'll be all set."
With router

and open their browsers. You have restored service. Your callers are ecstatic
and praise you on your dedication of going so far out of your way for them,
especially on a holiday.
45598: Another fine day in the Internet Service provider business. You hang up
the phone as you complete the order for that brand new MUD you're going to
install on the server. It's Saturday night right before Easter and in the heart
of the Spring Break. Your customers are going to love the new game. You'll have
it up and running in just a few minutes in the nick of time for all those
people with alot of spare time. You turn to your computer to begin downloading
the new game file so you can wrap up and go home. Thunder rumbles. A storm is
coming.
45981: As you begin to glide your mouse to the top of your browser to enter a
URL
there is a flash outside and the lights flicker! Instantly you hear lots
of
loud buzzing noises as the many reserve power supplies in your office come
to life to keep your internet server online. The buzzing stops, the lights
stay
on. Satisfied, you enter the URL of the web page you want to visit and hit
[Enter]. Your browser tells you it is unable to find the server. Impossible! In
a split second a wave of fear crosses your mind as you realize the one way this
could happen...
46378: In panic you run into the computer room and it looks like Christmas;
Your Cisco router, that magical box that puts your server onto the internet, is
hysterically blinking. Your worst nightmare becomes real: You are an Internet
Service Provider without the Internet.
46586: There's nothing here you can pet!
46618: She warmly accepts your touch and starts to purr loudly.
46667: Do you really think you can check yourself in right here, ace?
46716: You already checked in!
46739: You hand your credit card to the desk clerk who then busily taps away at
a computer. After you hear a printout being generated he nods and hands you a
room key. With room key in hand you find your way to...
46899: Are you sure you're in the right place for that?
46939: You search your pockets for your room key but come up empty. You'd
better have a room key if you plan on checking out.
47028: You hand your room key to the clerk who, in turn, hits a few keys on his
computer as you hear a printer starting to run. The printing noise stops and
the gentleman hands you your receipt as he thanks you for your stay.
47187: This is not the time to call your technical contact.
47229: You haven't got your cellular phone on you and you know how expensive
hotel phones are.
47298: You power up your cellular phone and dial the tech support number for
your internet backbone provider. You explain the situation to an operator who
asks you to hold after you tell her your tale of woe. When she takes you off
hold she tells you that Robert himself, president of the company, will meet you
tomorrow at the bar at the Baltimore Promenade. The operator reminds you to
bring your current router with you. You thank the operator and end the
call.

Now would be the perfect time to get some rest. If you don't hit that
king sized bed soon you're going to be useless in the morning.
47714: This is no place to go to sleep!
47751: You dive into the king sized bed and it feels every bit as comfortable
as it looked. That isn't saying much considering, due to your exhaustion, you'd
probably find a bed of nails comfortable. You sleep fitfully.

The phone rings
a few times. It's the wakeup call you asked for. You groggily acknowledge it
and get out of bed. You'd better get to Baltimore Harbor and meet with Robert.
48026: You sleep like a rock. The telephone by your bed rings a few times then
stops. It must be that wakeup call you asked for. You shake the sleep from your
head. You get the unnerving impression you were having a bad dream and you wake
up with the nagging feeling that you neglected to do something crucial.
49382: et/random and stay tuned. I'll be updating my page quite often with
status reports.

For help & info about this game type "info" at any prompt.
51968: Score:
51976: Moves:
51984: Time:
51992: You can't go that way.
52096: This is one of Tandy's best models. The usual buttons are present which
allow you to make phone calls. In addition, there are controls for volume
adjustment and speed dialing.
52220: A basic Motorola pager which displays the phone number of whoever beeps
you.
52276: All leather. The simple once-over fold type. Simple but nice.
52324: It's actually a credit-card type plastic card with some dots on it. The
number '101' is clearly visible along one edge.
52412: This is a sheet of old-style computer paper with the tractor holes on
the ends. At the top is the Ramada Inn logo and beneath it is a summary of your
charges for your night's stay at the hotel. A quick glance at the total at the
bottem tells you that you paid a pretty fair price.
52718: ROM changers, a 17 inch computer monitor and various other equipment. A
doorway to the east leads to the main set of offices.
52808: A Cisco 1000 Router is here, its various lights blinking hysterically.
52864: The router is a thin box, gray in color. It has a display panel in the
front. The legend 'Cisco' is displayed prominently on the panel.
52964: It is apparent that the occupants of this office think of work first and
organization last. Each of four desks are cluttered with print-outs, computer
equipment and telephones. These cramped offices are lined with filing cabinets
in addition to the desks. Free space is definitely a commodity. The computer
room lies to the west, the main exit is south.
53208: You are in the parking lot outside the Excaliber Office. Many parking
spaces are here keeping the shrubs and the garbage dumpster company. The
Excaliber Office is to the north.
53444: Your Thunderbird is parked here, it's powerful engine audible under the
hood.
53500: Your Ford Thunderbird is parked here.
53528: You are driving down the New Jersey Turnpike towards Baltimore. Trees
and streetlamps are a blur as you drive along at a quick pace.
53624: After just crossing the Delaware Memorial Bridge and paying your toll,
you continue towards Baltimore on Route 295 South.
53716: As you cross over a long bridge spanning a beautiful body of water on
both sides of you, you relax a bit in spite of your demanding mission. The road
is smooth, the traffic is light and A Flock of Seagulls playing on your stereo
makes you wish you were making this trip under more relaxed circumstances.
53968: You are at the end of a street where three tall buildings form a
junction. Garbage dumpsters, a few homeless people and street lights populate
this area. You feel a little unsafe.
54092: What a cute cat! She has the colors of a tabby and looks to be hardly
older than a kitten. She takes her attention off of a mouse she was spying to
look up at you and give a soft 'meow.'
54224: You pull into the parking lot of the Ramada and park your car. You are
so tired you do this automatically, taking the first spot your eyes lock on.
The entrance to the hotel lobby is to the north.
54360: You are just outside the Ramada Inn, Baltimore. The hotel itself is a
modern three story building. Neatly trimmed shrubs are all around. A glass door
beckons you to the hotel lobby to the north.
54500: This hotel must have been remodelled recently. Plush carpeting feel like
pillows beneath your feet. The decor, in general, is very modern. A few
comfortable chairs and couches are scattered throughout the room. To the west
lies the front desk. A hallway to the east leads to guest rooms.
54704: A single black door would usually lead guests to rooms on the upper
floors. However, a large 'Out of Order' sign hanging on the elevator call
button rules out this possibility.
54828: The front desk is actually a black lacquor counter behind which you see
two computer terminals, a printer and an elaborate phone system. A small wicker
basket containing books of matches is sitting on the counter just out of reach.
The main lobby is to the east.
55008: Pretty sharp. Glossy black with the red Ramada logo on the outside and a
toll free telephone number.
55078: !!! Hello, Traveller !!!

This hotel is equipped with the very latest in
customer service amenities. For example:

To check in to the hotel just type
"checkin".
To check out of the hotel just type "checkout".

Enjoy your stay!
55256: The desk clerk is a middle aged man, perhaps 40ish, of Indian descent.
He looks like he's fighting sleep.
55394: V.
55400: This is a comfortable room, if a little small. A king sized bed
dominates the middle of the room. By the window is a small round table with two
chairs facing each other. A writing desk is also here with a lamp on it. The
carpeting beneath your feet is soft and springy. The room has a fragrant smell
to it; the smell of clean without the smell of Mr. Clean, if you know what I
mean. Immediately adjacent to your room is the bathroom.
55704: One of the best spots in the city! The slight smell of brine tingle your
nostrils as you look at the light reflecting on the ocean. Classic wooden ships
with their sails flapping slightly in the wind line the docks. A few people are
walking about. Many of them seem to be milling about in the promenade off to
the west.
55924: Bustling with activity you hardly know where to begin. To the west is a
food court with every imaginable delicacy, to the north rows of carts with
various interesting and colorful trinkets invite you and to the south is a bar
overlooking an exquisite view of the harbor and the Atlantic Ocean at large.
56132: Your stomach grumbles slightly as you take in the fragrant aromas of
every type of food on earth. All around you can be seen stands for seafood,
pizza, sushi, hamburgers, tacos and more. Tables nearby are populated with
parents with their children, businessmen and tourists enjoying their food.
56336: Rows of carts line this part of the promenade manned by merchants making
their living. If ever you wanted a beeper, a souvenir coffee mug or an Orioles
baseball cap you've come to the right place.
56472: This view alone is worth your entire trip. The full expanse of the ocean
is laid out in front of you as far as you can see. Others seem to share your
opinion as most of the bar's patrons are enjoying their drinks sitting at
tables which take full advantage of this panoramic view.
Off in the distant you
see a medium-sized yacht moving along at a good pace.
56720: This room could be the bridge of a starship. Computer terminals are
everywhere displaying network status screens of everytype.
56808: Robert is a middle-aged man of thin build. A finely groomed moustache
accompanies a thoughtful look, as if he is working on a physics problem at this
very moment. And considering his mindset he may very well be. 

Robert is
holding a carboard box.
