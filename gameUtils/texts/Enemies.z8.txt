be running it on a very primitive interpreter which is unable properly to
perform the test).

81882: You are always self-possessed.

82090: That isn't available.
82133: That's hardly portable.
82157: That's fixed in place.
82181: You're carrying too many things already.
82257: Already on the floor.
82279: You haven't got that.
82322: Dropped.
82367: But it isn't there now.
82386: Removed.
82467: You can't put something on top of itself.
82545: You lack the dexterity.
82625: Done.
82667: You need to be holding it before you can put it into something else.
82747: Alas, it is closed.
82769: You'll need to take it off first.
82799: You can't put something inside itself.

83316: You can only get into something on the floor.

84570: You can't see inside, since it is closed.
84669: That doesn't seem to be something you can unlock.
84711: It's unlocked at the moment.
84739: That doesn't seem to fit the lock.
84793: That doesn't seem to be something you can lock.
84859: First you'll have to close it.
84887: That doesn't seem to fit the lock.
84941: That's not something you can switch.

85381: You can't wear that!
85403: You're not holding that!
85427: You're already wearing that!
85477: That's plainly inedible.
85510: Not bad.
85526: That was a rhetorical question.
85554: This dangerous act would achieve little.
85588: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
85624: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
85662: That seems unnecessary.
85712: What a good idea.
85732: You smell nothing unexpected.
85786: You taste nothing unexpected.
85866: You feel nothing unexpected.
85892: Digging would achieve nothing here.
85924: Cutting that up would achieve little.
85956: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
85990: You would achieve nothing by this.
86020: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
86054: But there's no water here to carry.
86086: Oh, don't apologise.
86108: Real adventurers do not use such language.
86144: Quite.
86156: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
86190: There's not enough water to swim in.
86222: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
86256: You can't usefully blow that.
86334: No, you can't set that to anything.
86397: But you aren't holding that.
86462: It is fixed in place.
86484: You are unable to.
86504: That would be less than courteous.
86529: Nothing obvious happens.
86558: Is that the best you can think of?
86588: That's not a direction.
86607: Not that way you can't.
86657: You achieve nothing by this.
86688: Futile.
86695: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
86744: You talk to yourself a while.
86767: This provokes no reaction.
86795: There is no reply.
86815: Nothing is on sale.
86861: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
86899: Time passes.
86915: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
86986: The weather has rapidly deteriorated, raindrops bouncing off the slanted
marquee onto the pavement. Darkness comes early in the winter months, but
fortunately the street lamps keep this area of the city well illuminated. The
prospect of the warm lobby of the eight-screen cinema to the west becomes more
attractive with each passing second.
87226: You take another glance at your watch: twenty minutes to seven. Glancing
up and down the street, the only pedestrian you see is a down and out
disappearing into an alleyway.
87349: ymfzuhn

You had arranged to meet Joanna at half past to see a movie,
and possibly a romantic dinner afterwards. It came as a relief when she
accepted your invitation, with all the attentions that slimy boss of yours,
Keith, has been giving her lately. Now you're beginning to think your short
lived luck has run out already.
87603: The motorcycle moved so quickly you lost track of it.
87642: All the city's main stores have closed for the day.
87712: Hadn't you better answer the phone before you go wandering around?
87770: You never have a chance to get away.
87815: The caller is close enough to have you in sight. Even if it's just an
annoying prankster, it's probably best not to antagonise a drunken joker on
Friday night.
87934: "It's very impolite to turn your back on a conversation, not that
manners were ever a part of your makeup. Want to drop out already? Kind of like
being back in Wilson's sports class -- lagging behind the rest of us,
succombing to the heat. Are you in better shape now than six years ago, or have
all those black tie dinners fattened you up even more? Yes -- I know all about
you, Charlie Boy."
88242: There's something weird about the caller's voice.
88329: You have other things to worry about right now.
88364: It wouldn't be a good idea to wander away from the arranged meeting
place. Joanna would probably turn up late and blame you for standing
88488: The black motorcycle you saw earlier turns into Princess Street, the
glare from the headlamp shining directly into your eyes. You see the biker take
one hand off the handlebars and pull something from the side of the motorcycle.
88653: The bullet narrowly misses you, shattering the front door of the cinema
complex. Tiny fragments of glass fall onto the pavement as the motorbike
screeches to a halt nearby, a handgun clasped tightly in the rider's gloved
hand. The curved face plate reflects several distorted images: ushers
scrambling for cover, your terrified face.

Still in shock, you are unable to
react as the gun is aimed point blank at the centre of your head. From within
the barrel, you see a tongue of orange fire not unlike that on the rear of the
motorcycle. Then the darkness comes.
89084: An orange minibus, part of the late night student service, drives along
the street without stopping. You catch sight of the large puddle by the kerb
just in time to dodge out of the way of mini-cascade which follows the
vehicle's speedy passage through it. Before you can shout any profanities at
the driver, the bus has become nothing more than a trail of lights in the
distance.
89357: A young couple make their way into the cinema, disappearing into the
lobby.
89427: You become aware of the sound of an engine running, tracing its source
to a black motorcycle at the north end of Princess Street. The leather-clad
cyclist brings it steadily to a halt, almost directly opposite from where
you're standing.
89667: The cinema isn't going anyplace.
89724: That's where you're standing: on the rain soaked pavement under the
marquee.
89779: The marquee is out of reach.
89802: It's a fairly cheap digital wristwatch with a simple display. Although
the picture on the box it came in clearly showed three buttons, you see only
one: a round silver extension on the right hand edge. The in-built light makes
the time easy to read:
89993: It would be too easy to lose if you did that.
90031: That would just cut into your personal budget.
90084: Pressing the button displays today's date:
90159: On the opposite side of the street is a black motorcycle, its exhaust
fumes visible in the cold nightime air. The rider, face hidden behind a crash
helmet, glances occasionally in your direction.
90303: With the exception of a painted trail of fire towards the rear, the
motorcycle has been entirely coated in black paint. Mounted on the front is a
single powerful headlamp which is dipped slightly towards the road.
90463: The motorcycle doesn't belong to you.
90518: Taking another look at the rider on the back of the motorcycle, you
decide against it.
90618: For a few seconds you watch each other, the motorcyclist's eyes
invisible behind a sheet of silvered plastic. Thick clouds of exhaust fumes
obscure the rider as the engine revs up. The smog is pierced only by the
reflection of sodium street lamps in the lowered visor. After slowing down
somewhere to the south, the motorcycle turns up a side street.
90895: That might bring a swift end to your employment and consequently your
seventeen thousand a year salary.
90971: Do you make a habit of kissing strangers?
91040: Saint Martinn
Another patron makes their way into the cinema. The
movie's about to start -- still no sign of Joanna.
91124: Another late night worker drives home in an inexpensive car, momentarily
silhouetting the cyclist as they drive past.
91295: The button is an integral part of the telephone.
91357: The idea with a button is to push it.
91393: The cordless telephone is one of your most vital pieces of equipment.
Damaging it would be a costly and stupid idea.
91507: You always like to keep the phone handy for emergencies.
91558: There's no call to listen to.
91581: The caller's voice is easy to hear, if somewhat distorted.
91632: Sarah :nJust who are you talking to?
91683: "I warned you, Charlie."

The caller terminates the transmission.
91739: "I had expected better manners, Charlie. Please don't interrupt again."
91830: "I'm surprised you remembered her name. I always thought women were
window dressing to you, but then again -- maybe you have changed."
91981: "Is that how you think of her? I'm surprised she'll even go out with
you. She does have a name you know."
92069: "Sorry -- wrong guess. Do keep trying, though."
92122: There's nobody on the other end of the line.
92155: Somehow, you don't think whoever's on the other end of the line will be
very cooperative.
92267: You are distracted by a sudden beeping from your portable telephone.
92326: The cordless telephone beeps again.
92418: Your cordless telephone is still beeping.
92457: Saint Martinn
The beeping stops abruptly.
92492: The voice on the other end of the line is little more than a whisper,
making it difficult to discern any details about the caller.

"Hello, Charlie
Boy. You haven't changed much since graduation. In fact, you looked quite lost
when I drove by earlier. Are you lost, Charlie? The world of accountancy is
quite a maze, even for someone with your talents. Or maybe you've lost
something important. Yes -- I think that's what it is, isn't it?"
92818: "You really do disappoint me, Charlie. After all, you were the college
whiz-kid -- the teacher's gleaming idol who never missed a day, the one person
who turned up smiling in a neatly pressed uniform and black polished shoes.
Quite a role model for the rest of us. We had it drilled into us: Charles
Johnson is an example, Charles Johnson should be an inspiration, Charles
Johnson this, Charles Johnson that. They must have told us how wonderful you
were a thousand times over."
93166: "Just look at yourself today. What are you? An average businessman who
never took his chances. An
93245: ."

The last word is said with such venom you almost look at your life
in retrospect. The person on the other end of the line continues, "You never
really had to graft for anything, did you? You never had to slaughter away,
strain with a problem. Well, tonight that's going to change, Charlie Boy."
93465: "You see, I have something you want -- another little thing that just
fell into your lap. If you want it back, you're going to have to earn it. This
isn't going to be like one of Miss Gavaghan's mickey-mouse tests, where you
walk away with a hundred percent and a pretty certificate. Tonight we're going
to really see who is the smartest: you, or me. Personally, I think you're one
of those college boys who can't take the heat."
93779: "You're probably wondering what it is I've taken. It's not entirely
obvious when you have so many things you take for granted. So then, what do you
have that's bright yellow, pretty pink and about to disappear?"
93933: exn
"Come on, Charlie. I'm sure you can work it out."
93983: "You didn't forget everything you learned at university, did you? Has
all the accountancy nonsense Hanningers feed you numbed the brain cells? Maybe
I should make it a little clearer: why exactly are you standing in the rain?
Are you on an outdoor field trip?"
94216: "I'm afraid you're going to have to hurry. I haven't got time to kill on
you. Pardon the pun."
94300: Saint Martinn
"Three. Two. One. Buzz. Sorry, but you weren't successful
on this occasion. I'd like to wish you the best of luck with your career on the
other side, Charlie. Goodbye."

The caller's voice is replaced by a dialing
tone.
94487: The caller has stopped transmitting. The words from earlier in the
conversation come back to you, "Bright yellow. Pretty pink. About to
disappear....."
94615: Dashing into the cinema lobby, you call a taxi to take you across town
to the apartment building where Joanna lives. Thankfully, the amount of traffic
you encounter is minimal. You don't even stop to argue with the driver over the
fare, ignoring his verbal abuse as you step out into Pennyworth Lane.
94852: You're already answering the telephone call.
94890: There is no call to take at the moment.
94930: You press the button which answers incoming calls.
95020: One touch of the cutoff button is enough to silence the beeping.
95070: There is no incoming call to cut off at the moment.
95115: Irritated by what you assume to be a crank caller, you press firmly down
on the cutoff button.
95383: It's a colour photograph, four inches by six. You distinctly remember
paying two pounds to a tourist so they'd take a picture of you and Joanna
outside the British Museum. It was almost worth it too, her blonde locks
dazzlingly beautiful under the midday sun. Arm in arm, you stand smiling: the
perfect couple.
95609: The kitchen knife passes neatly through the photograph.
95648: The photograph has been damaged by the use of the kitchen knife as a
skewer.
95723: The photograph is far too precious to throw away in the street.
95775: It might be best to drop the photo inside the apartment, so it won't get
lost.
95865: Tearing up the photo won't be any help.
95965: The memories seem so distant now.
96088: You pull the photograph off the end of the kitchen knife.
96145: Saint Martinn
The cab driver finally concedes defeat on getting a tip
from you, ramming his foot down on the accelerator. You see him stick two
fingers up at you before he drives off, leaving you alone outside Joanna's
apartment.
96314: That wouldn't put you any higher in Joanna's estimations.
96364: Joanna wouldn't appreciate you climbing all over the walls.
96412: There's nothing hidden in the hedges.
96450: The intercom provides Joanna with a means of communication to her front
porch. The setup is quite simple: a button to sound a doorbell inside her
apartment, and a speaker for her to talk through. Directly underneath the
buzzer is a name plate:
96647: You hear a buzzer sound somewhere inside the apartment.
96691: The intercom is switched off at the moment.
96729: Pulling the intercom out of the wall won't help.
96779: The intercom isn't sentient!
96807: You wait to see if anybody replies to your message, but all you hear is
silence.
96871: The gnome's head has been moved aside, exposing the hollow interior.
96920: Every part of the gnome, from the circular base to the head, has been
delicately painted in bright colours. The only anomaly appears to be the sadly
depicted facial expression.
97058: The gnome is too heavy to lift.
97105: Concealed inside the garden gnome is a small metal key.
97144: Nothing is concealed inside the garden gnome.
97188: That's just a little too small for you.
97228: You can feel a slight indentation around the gnome's neck.
97317: The clay resists all your attempts to damage it.
97362: You've already lifted back the gnome's head.
97395: The indentation is too narrow to get a good grip.
97440: The gnome's head has already been swung back.
97480: Despite pressing around on the surface of the gnome, you discover no
secret compartments.
97546: As you press against the head, it swings out of position, allowing
access to the gnome's hollow interior.
97631: There's nothing on the gnome to close.
97663: The gnome's head snaps back into place.
97704: There's nowhere on the gnome to put anything.
97784: The gnome is attached to the base quite firmly.
97829: You can see the gnome is hollow; knocking on it would be pointless.
97878: The gnome sounds hollow.
97911: Touching the brass ring causes it to wobble slightly.
97970: Saint MartinnThe brass ring rotates through a hundred and eighty
degrees, sliding smoothly into place.
98052: Apart from a gnome made of the same material, nothing stands on the clay
base.
98114: There's no more room on the base.
98272: ihm. She has recently installed an intercom system as a further security
measure
98361: The inside of the apartment is enshrouded in shadow.
98398: It's a cold night outside.
98475: The only thing you hear in reply is the muffled sound of psychotic
laughter.
98533: "I'm afraid you'll just have to figure it out, Charlie Boy."
98580: Nobody answers your knocking.
98608: The door is especially designed to resist damage.
98655: If you want to drop something inside the apartment, why not just wander
on in?
98755: Joanna was so obsessed with personal safety she had the mailbox removed,
opting instead to use the post office.
98861: The lock is quite stiff, flakes of ice having frozen inside the keyhole.
Eventually the key turns, and you hear a bolt slide back somewhere behind the
door.
99009: You have been locked inside the apartment.
99040: The apartment door is firmly locked.
99072: The door is wide open already.
99106: You feel warm air brush past your cheeks as the door swings inwards.
99202: There's no way you could force this door open.
99279: The peephole is integrated into the woodwork of the door.
99325: The glass is reinforced and will not break.
99366: You can see through the door anyway.
99401: The psycho is still watching.
99431: There's nobody standing outside the door.
99462: You're greeted by a pitch black circle of darkness.
99504: You're supposed to look through it.
99556: The peephole stays closed all the time.
99687: The hedges obstruct your vision of the apartment building.
99728: The resident gargoyle looks down on you from the roof of the porch, eyes
gleaming with artificial fire. You are unable to shake off the suspicion that
someone is watching your every move.
99868: You're quite some distance from the apartment building.
99914: The marble pillars are too smooth to climb.
99950: One look at the gargoyle convinces you to search for an alternative
resolution.
100039: The metal feels cold.
100061: That won't do much good unless it's inside a keyhole.
100120: Saint Martinn
You catch a whiff of something burning elsewhere in the
apartment.
100196: There is no warning at all. You barely catch sight of the masked
intruder before a gloved fist smashes into the side of your face.
100301: Your enemy, spotting the kitchen knife gripped firmly in your hand,
sends it spinning out of range with a deft kick. Now defenceless, you are ill
prepared for another blow, this time to the stomach.
100443: Your enemy, with the strong advantage of surprise, is able to deliver a
swift kick to your stomach before you can react.
100528: The psycho's soft leather boots make no sound as they cross the
carpet.

"Quite a revelation -- your interest in Joanna. I thought the only
people you cared about were Charles Dickens, George Stephenson -- Michael
Faraday. Do you see a pattern beginning to form here, Charlie Boy? You'd think
somebody who spent his whole day counting banknotes would see the answer
straight away."
100815: The burning smell seems to emanate from the room to the north.
100881: Under the gaze of the psycho, you make your way into the bedroom.
100945: You drag yourself into the kitchen.
100985: The image of Rose floating lifelessly in the hot tub of water still
lingers at the forefront of your mind, causing you to reconsider.
101140: The photo of Joanna is much smaller than the one taken from the frame.
101199: Enough vandalism has been done already.
101233: You don't need any of the photographs.
101275: Nothing to find here.
101344: Joanna's telephone is on a coffee table near the door.
101394: Joanna's bulky telephone takes up all the space.
101451: Without its vital connection to the network, the telephone is useless.
101502: The telephone is fine where it is.
101532: There's nothing underneath the coffee table.
101570: You don't fancy sharing a glass roof with Hera.
101617: That would only amuse your enemy further.
101648: There's no need to wreck the coffee table.
101694: The statue weighs the table down.
101764: The rest of the markings are in Greek; you can't understand them.
101823: Not much use now.
101838: In contrast to the rest of the apartment, Joanna's telephone is old
fashioned, with a dial in place of touch tone buttons.
101942: Everything is set up properly.
101965: You're no expert on telephone repair.
102004: The line is dead.
102019: You hear the dialing tone.
102060: Joanna's telephone has been disconnected.
102164: Your enemy took care of that.
102187: Damaging Joanna's property isn't why you're here.
102263: Joanna's telephone is out of service.
102292: There's nobody on the other end of the line.
102335: Your enemy keeps on looking back at you.
102375: You're no psychologist; you have no idea what your enemy is thinking.
102426: Your enemy is on the other side of the door.
102570: A masked intruder stands over you, impatiently flexing gloved hands and
watching you through narrow eye slits.
102657: The intruder doesn't seem interested in bargaining.
102709: General conversation won't help here.
102743: Eh?
102762: In your present position, you can't really swing a punch.
102817: The intruder easily sidesteps your punch, effortlessly flooring you
with a leg sweep.
102883: You feel dizzy, quite obviously no match for your enemy's superior
fighting ability.
102949: Your enemy's arms become a blur, a succession of punches forcing you
back to the ground.
103018: Doing that won't harm the intruder.
103064: Your enemy's grip is just too strong.
103093: The attack has left you out of breath; the enemy is simply too quick
for you.
103227: That's impossible while your enemy is holding you.
103347: Your enemy looms above you like a giant black shadow.

"Must be a big
comedown for the hero of Saint Martins College. You're afraid just like Rose --
and Sarah. Had you forgotten about your previous love interest? It's quite easy
to get caught up in the world of finance and forget about the rest of us
unfortunates who never had your chances."
103599: The intruder's tone becomes even more menacing.

"Rose spent the last
five minutes of her life trying to convince me she deserved to live. Whatever
made you hook up with a prostitute's girlfriend -- were you so intimately
involved you'd lost all sense of morality? I would have preferred to let the
darling friends drown together -- side by side, arm in arm -- but that would
give you nothing to play for, and games aren't quite the same without rewards."
103927: "I hope your performance improves -- Joanna gave me more problems.
She's quite the karate expert, but you probably didn't pay much attention.
After all, it's not something you can make a buck out of -- and that's all that
really matters,
104116: "Well, Charlie -- enough small talk."

Once more, the intruder's
agility becomes evident as you are dealt a chest blow, grabbed, swiftly spun
around. The enemy locks one arm around your neck, a well practised stance
making escape impossible.

"It would be so easy to snap your neck in two, but I
want more than that. I'd like to see you fail for once, Charlie. You think
you're a major player, but in reality you're just a pawn in a very big game --
and it's time to start playing."
104472: Your eyes focus on the glinting needle of a hypordermic syringe. The
sharp point pierces your neck just below your right ear, gloved fingers
depressing the plunger. As the green liquid mingles with your blood, your enemy
releases you. Dizziness takes over, once forgotten memories flashing before
your eyes.

Joanna's smile on your first date -- the sour taste of red wine --
Sarah's body on the morgue table -- the sound of clapping.....
104841: You're being forced to do that.
104871: The intruder's leather boots don't make a sound.
104935: Your enemy watches you stumble back into the hallway.
104983: The ceiling fan clanks whenever it gets stuck.
105021: The fan spreads the awful smell through the bedroom.
105073: The fan is protected by a wire grille.
105109: You have no idea where the power switch is.
105163: The rest of the bedroom is under the fan.
105194: The ceiling fan is out of reach.
105226: The skylight is out of view.
105276: Most of the room is underneath.
105299: The plants are quite inaccessible.
105407: The touch sensitive pads are an integral part of the canister, and
cannot be removed.
105526: You may as well leave the pads alone now the canister is open.
105786: Perhaps it is simply your imagination, but you thought you saw the
display change to a light green for a split second.
105954: The display changes to light green once more, and this time you know it
wasn't your imagination.
106123: The letters turn light green for a third time, and the side of the
canister swings open. Looking inside, all you see is a single glass vial, which
you can only pray is the antidote you're looking for.
106367: The canister is too far away to make out any details.
106406: Now the canister has fallen from its previous elevated position, you
can make out six touch sensitive pads running along the side. Each one is
displaying an electronically depicted letter of the alphabet. The current
sequence reads:
106583: Some of the light glints off a steel canister suspended from the roof,
the thorny vine supporting it stretching up to an out of sight pulley. The
other end has been tightly fastened to a nasty hook screwed into one wall.
106736: A steel canister lies on one of its circular ends in the middle of the
room, and the vine that once supported it curls loosely along the floor.
106864: The steel canister is well beyond your reach.
106910: It'll take more than that to dislodge the canister.
106960: The canister might be reasonably light, but in your present condition
it is quite immovable.
107036: It doesn't look as if it's going to be that simple.
107082: The only mechanism to open the canister seems to be the touch sensitive
pads.
107144: Forcing open the canister would be impossible.
107187: The canister seems to be as difficult to close as it was to open.
107240: Eh?
107250: One end of the hook has been forcibly screwed into the wall, the other
tapering off to an extremely sharp point.
107334: Now robbed of its former tension, what's left of the vine hangs limply
from the lowest point of the curved piece of metal.
107419: A thorn covered vine stretches from the hook towards the ceiling.
107508: The hook has been forced deep into the wall, and you don't have the
strength to pull it back out.
107582: Bashing against the hook causes it to vibrate slightly, but it still
remains wedged in place.
107652: That course of action is obviously futile.
107696: Saint MartinnSharp black thorns line the entire length of the thick
stemmed vine. Their tips have a red glossy sheen to them, like they've been
specially "treated" by you know who.
107817: What's left of the vine trails along the floor near the steel canister.
107895: The vine is no longer worth bothering with.
107934: Rather foolishly, you grab hold of the vine and attempt to shake down
the canister. Several of the black thorns jab into your skin, smearing the
mysterious red substance across the palms of your hands.

Paralysed almost
immediately, you fall to the floor, beads of sweat running down the side of
your face. After the ten most agonising seconds of your life, it's all over.
108196: Saint MartinnThe red glossy sheen on the tips of the vine's thorns
makes you think twice about grabbing hold of the vine.
108301: The vine isn't tied to that!
108407: The vine has already been severed, if somewhat messily.
108448: Even the sharp kitchen knife is able to make little impression against
the toughness of the vine.
108563: Slowly at first but with gradual improvement, the fire starts to eat
away at the vine. Its fuel supply exhausted, the photograph curls up and
disintegrates, but the flames on the vine continue growing. The tension
increases until finally the vine snaps and with nothing to support it, the
steel canister drops onto the floor.
108828: Putting things on the vine won't help.
108878: The smell of burning gas is easily identifiable.
108933: The foul smell is coming from the stove.
108975: It's already closed.
109008: Washing is the last thing on your mind right now.
109048: It belongs to Joanna.
109101: Looking inside you see it's empty -- and nothing you have needs
washing.
109211: There's nothing worth finding under there.
109249: Trashing Joanna's kitchen equipment would cost both of you a lot of
money.
109306: The ivory handle seems deceptively harmless next to the blade,
noticeably sharpened to a very frightening point.
109537: The knife is hopelessly out of your reach.
109581: That wouldn't be a good idea, seeing as there's a burning photograph
stuck on the end.
109644: You'd rather hang onto your only available means of defence.
109692: Another glance at the blade disuades you.
109739: Jkdjao 5nThat won't do any good.
109771: The photo is already on the end of the knife.
109808: Saint MartinnYou slide the point of the knife through the photograph,
trying desperately to avoid damaging your image.
109902: A huge array of knobs and buttons, none of which make the slightest
amount of sense, clutter the top of this ultra-modern stove. At least the
manufacturers had the sense to include a plastic handle with the door.
110067: In your absence, the oven door has been swung open. It takes a few
seconds to identify the charred remains inside, but the smouldering fur and
still visible paws identify the creature as a rat, quite obviously now deceased
after unknown suffering. The funeral pyre, flames at the rear of the stove, is
still burning.
110286: A hi-tech kitchen stove under the counter seems to be the source of the
terrible odour.
110359: The oven is just a tad on the heavy side.
110395: The stove is already turned on.
110425: The controls are too complicated to work out.
110468: The oven door is closed.
110487: You take another look, but unfortunately what you see is undoubtedly
real. The rat's ordeal has finished, but the flames still burn.
110594: You haven't got the oven door open yet.
110623: You are too weak to lift the thick and now prohibitively heavy oven
door.
110686: The oven door is already open.
110709: The door on the stove is stuck.
110742: There's no reason to take out your frustration on the oven.
110809: The oven door is open.
110867: The oven door still refuses to yield despite your best efforts.
110917: Not your most wisest of decisions.
110982: Leave the poor animal alone.
111025: For safety reasons, the flames are out of reach.
111065: The movement of the flames is almost hypnotic.
111103: The fires are already burning.
111184: You've already set the photograph on fire.
111220: Apart from the end of the blade turning a crimson red, not much
happens.
111278: The photograph quickly catches fire in the searing heat, the past
starting to vanish in a thin trail of smoke.
111425: Touching a naked flame would be a very silly thing to do.
111547: The jacuzzi is softly bubbling away.
111574: The sound of running water.
111609: After your recent experience, you'd rather not go near the Jacuzzi.
111663: Obviously someone has dropped a bar of soap in the water, as it is far
too murky to make anything out.
111739: If Joanna were to catch you in her bathtub, it would pretty much end
your relationship.
111809: The water in the bathtub is boiling hot.
111859: Putting things in the Jacuzzi is not the best of ideas; you might never
get them back.
111929: Given the water's soapy content, it might be best if you didn't drink
it.
112016: The Jacuzzi is bubbling away nicely.
112044: Saint MartinnMoments after pressing the switch the water seems to come
alive, with bubbles the size of your hand breaking the surface.
112141: The bubble bath isn't turned on.
112167: Saint MartinnAnother press of the switch causes the flow of bubbles to
cease.
112256: The warm water taps are firmly fixed to the Jacuzzi.
112300: The warm water intake is at a maximum.
112362: You give one of the taps a good punch, but it doesn't seem to be any
looser.
112422: That's not the solution here.
112450: The heat from the water has conducted through the metal, but the handle
is well insulated.
112527: The lever is part of the pedestal.
112570: Rose's naked corpse is not something you wish to see twice.
112628: As you pull the lever, unseen chains clank against their bearings. A
miniature whirlpool forms in the Jacuzzi, the water level soon dropping low
enough for you to see her. You drop the mobile phone into the soapy water,
unable to come to terms with the savage picture of betrayed innocence.

It's
difficult to ascertain an age since wet sandy hair covers most of her blistered
face, but she can't be much older than twenty. You only see her body for a
split second before sheer revulsion makes you look away, but the details are
memorable: ankles bound with strong twine, adhesive tape starting to peel off
her swollen mouth, tattoos of red flowers on her hips.

A coppery bracelet is
fastened around her left wrist, a needle jabbing out from underneath. Apart
from that the woman has been stripped naked, deprived of dignity in her final
hour. 

It's not your girlfriend -- her friend Rose is the one who lies
butchered in the bathtub. You recognise her from Joanna's holiday snaps, and
will always remember her trademark baby faced smile in glossy print. The real
thing will never be yours to treasure; staring death in the face is enough to
snatch away even the most persistent happiness. 

The lever locks back into a
closed position and the Jacuzzi refills, sealing the poor girl inside her
watery tomb.
113546: That's not how to use a lever.
113583: The colour of blood.
113600: The garter is made from red silk; such kinkiness isn't something you'd
associate with Joanna.
113690: Somewhere underneath the water is the owner's corpse.
113729: About a foot of water.
113752: Sarah XnNo sign of any owner.
113773: The woman has no further use for the garter.
113811: It's a woman's garment -- you don't need to touch it.
113852: Just looking at the garter reminds you of her naked corpse.
113936: The vial is closed.
113963: The vial looks fairly easy to open and close.
114003: There's no way you could put anything inside the vial.
114085: Touching the pale blue liquid doesn't seem to do any harm.
114218: The vial isn't open.
114263: Hoping this isn't part of your enemy's warped sense of humour, you
drink the contents of the vial in one gulp. The liquid burns your throat as it
goes down, but the effect is only temporary. All sense of feeling leaves your
body, exhaustion taking over.

A child's call for help, distant but still very
much audible, is the last thing you hear before falling unconscious.
114619: Sharp pain rips along your neck, near where the needle made its lethal
incision. The poison is starting to take effect.
114709: Your state of health continues to decline.
114747: The symptoms of fever are hastily presenting themselves: the generic
splitting headache, a readiness to vomit, shivering cold hands.
114847: You're beginning to hallucinate -- clown faced enemies are everywhere,
calling your name in whispered unison.

"Charlie Boy, Charlie Boy....."
114963: The venom has you in its ghostly grip, reaching out to squeeze the
essence of life from you.
115035: It's becoming difficult to breathe.
115069: You can feel the increase of blood pressure, your heartbeat speeding up
towards breaking point.
115146: The imaginary vision of your enemy's masked face torments you one last
time, before fading into the encompassing darkness.
115427: The professor, still smiling, urges you to take the certificate.
115481: The audience maintain their applause.
115530: The faculty dean announces your name -- and the professor, who has
somehow managed to keep smiling all night, holds out your certificate.
115639: The sound of clapping.
115663: That's a little vain of you.
115695: You don't want to get blinded on your big night.
115751: The control panel is behind the stage.
115785: You're directly under the lights.
115810: The spotlights are up on the ceiling.
115865: Powerful people always get the best seats.
115896: You're not supposed to go anywhere near the governors. They have their
own private table at the rear of the stage.
115978: The governors are just figureheads.
116015: Individual faces stand out: Tony glares back hatefully, his small army
of thugs never far away. Someone's missing, an adoring face having gone astray.
Joanna is all smiles, sure -- but you know there's an empty seat out there.
116189: The audience seating is inferior.
116214: The crowd is several metres back from the stage.
116250: Nobody can hear you -- there's just too much noise.
116321: You're not that grateful for the prize.
116365: The professor nods, though you're quite certain he hasn't heard a
single word you've said due to all the noise in the hall.
116463: The writing is too small to make out.
116498: Just take the certificate and stop trying to be creative.
116544: You take the certificate from the professor's hand, glancing down in
pride at your achievement. Something's wrong -- a red stain makes it illegible.
You turn queryingly towards the professor, but his smile is gone. A hate mob,
Tony at the forefront, starts up rude chants which quickly catch on. Joanna,
looking terrified on the front row, screams.

You follow her pointing finger
back to the professor. Using long fingernails, he peels away the underside of
his face, depositing a blood covered rubber mask on the stage. The clown's
smile seems hideously grotesque under the stage lights. Your enemy's eyes open,
staring directly into yours.

"Hello Charlie -- want to play?"
117099: You awake from your near death experience to the recurring nightmare of
your enemy's masked face. Damp leather strokes across your forehead, the
clown's red smile dominating your hazy vision.

"Poor man: all cold, alone. Are
you starting to feel your life slip away yet? What will the people at
Hanningers do when they find their trusted servant poisoned to death? Imagine
having to write your obituary, Charlie. If they had the decency to be truthful,
they'd say what a heartless creep you were, but the ability to lie is second
nature to accountants."

The psycho walks over to the telephone and rips out
the cable, pausing to show you the key to the apartment.

"You dropped this
117627: cibl,. How careless -- anybody could walk in and spoil the fun. A
little tip for you: keep in mind what you desire most and you might actually
live through this."

The intruder walks away through the entrance, slamming the
front door shut. An eye swaying excitedly from side to side watches you through
the peephole, enlarged by the convex glass.
117929: Your eyelids feel heavy, and you wonder if help is coming.
117982: Your vision is nothing more than a few blurred images. You don't even
notice him until his shadow falls over your injured body -- then you recognise
Tony, a loud mouthed boy from some of the classes you attended. Any hopes you
have of being helped are dashed by the sadistic grin on his face.
118198: There is no sympathy in his voice, his entire tone mocking your
predicament.

"Looks like you've had a bit of a comedown. You're that new boy
-- Charlie isn't it? I never was any good with names."

Tony stoops down to
pick up the iron railing, his other hand lifting you up into a sitting position
next to the tree.
118432: "I watched you be a good samaritan with Joanna earlier. She's nobody --
just some spoiled brat who can't do her sums. They're thinking of throwing her
out -- seems her parents can't afford the fee. I'm looking forward to her
company."

Tony's grip becomes tighter, his eyes hardening like rocks.

"Yet
you didn't help
118673: . I was standing in the queue, and all I wanted was a couple of pounds
for a plate of chips. A simple token of respect, but obviously you don't get it
-- I'm the number one kingpin around here.
118822: Joannaxm
"It looks as though you still have some learning to do.
There's nothing wrong with a little pain -- it helps you remember your place.
Why not try and sleep it off?"

Tony's intentions become clear when he raises
the iron bar above his head. You feel the cold steel bite into your chest,
blood dripping into the rain-filled gutter. Red liquid mixes with clear, the
diffusion patterns etched forever in your memory. You don't even feel the
second swing -- or the third.

Flashbacks from your opening week at college
remain vivid in your mind: getting top marks in your maths homework, Joanna's
simple yet moving pleas for help, the future love in her eyes -- and most of
all Tony, hovering like a demon in your memories ever since that fateful day.
119415: Your ears are still ringing from the impact.
119462: You throat seems dry, and only a deep croak emerges from your lips.
119523: When you try to move, you feel a pain in your leg. One of your bones
must have broken in the fall.
119602: The fence runs around the entire perimeter of the college. Looking
through the wire mesh, you see the playing fields and red brick walls of Saint
Martins, a faded sign nailed firmly to a post in the foreground.
119877: The gap in the fence is too narrow, and the fierce spikes form quite an
effective anti-climbing mechanism.
119964: Apart from the iron railing, the fence presents quite an obstacle.
120011: The iron railing was the fence's only weakness.
120051: There's no space to crawl under the fence.
120095: That would be impossible.
120128: You lack the welding skills necessary to replace the iron railing.
120201: The soil is bare, grass having perished under poor conditions of care.
120257: The details of the headmaster have long since faded, leaving only the
name of the institution:
120333: The sign is safely out of reach behind the fence.
120385: Saint Martinn
The young girl picks up the soft leather ball, spinning
it delicately with one finger. She seems to notice you for the first time, and
walks over to rub your head gently. Your eyes meet, inexplicably transmitting
the unspoken language of love. Suddenly apprehensive, she peers nervously down
College Road. Without any explanation, she darts out of sight.
120717: ixn
The girl breaks her silence with a single, softly spoken
word.

"Help."
120781: The girl looks pleadingly at you, a single tear absorbed by the mud on
her face.
120841: zii    ok ohn
Pointing a finger at the upper reaches of the tree, you
notice for the first time what the girl wants. A red ball of the softer variety
nestles in the upper branches.
120985: The girl, apart from her whimpering, shows no response.
121031: That would be pure cowardice.
121059: The girl would probably take that the wrong way.
121177: It's not entirely obvious what she wants.
121233: You don't really feel like leaving the poor girl alone.
121299: Help.
121314: Please.
121331: Mister.
121368: Can't reach ball."
121434: The iron railing fell from your hand when you slipped, landing a metre
away from its parent fence.
121513: It looks a lot more dangerous in Tony's hands.
121548: The iron railing isn't much more than a metal bar, the point having
been blunted. Hardened green paint is starting to fall off, exposing the rust
underneath.
121702: The girl watches with interest as you remove the iron railing from the
fence, flinching back at the sight of you gripping it firmly ready for action.
121811: Throwing iron railings around is very dangerous.
121879: A combination of the weather and irresponsible teenagers have reduced
the oak tree to a sorry state. Messages have been crudely scribbled into the
bark, and most of the lower branches have been snapped off.
122025: The tree is in a somewhat better state than down below, but air
pollution is having a detrimental effect.
122108: A soft red ball is nestling comfortably in the upper reaches of the
tree.
122179: You see no reason to go climbing around.
122208: You manage to find some branches which easily hold your weight, and
scramble up the side of the tree.
122302: There's no point in putting things in the tree.
122404: The tree seems to be reasonably firm.
122436: The messages are the usual indecipherable prankster stuff.
122501: The red ball is well beyond your reach.
122530: Even from your present vantage point, you are still unable to get hold
of the leather ball.
122654: Saint MartinmTaking firm hold of the branches, you reach out with the
iron railing. After gentle prodding, the ball comes loose of the tree and
bounces onto the street.
122773: The branch you are holding onto collapses under your weight, and you
feel your hand slipping hopelessly along the damp wood. Without any support,
you fall several metres to the pavement, hearing the crunch of bone against
stone.
122972: You are unable to reach the red ball.
123018: You climb back down to street level.
123139: His shadow is long under the evening sky.
123178: The air is saturated with thick dust. It seems to be everywhere,
covering the floor and warped wooden shelving in thick layers.
123277: Bare electrical wiring provides power to the only light source: a low
wattage lightbulb flickering with alarming frequency.
123362: An empty light socket swings on bare electrical wiring.
123407: The shelves appear to have developed a certain degree of unsteadiness.
123456: The wooden shelves stretch above your head, supported by equally flimsy
brackets.
123547: All of the shelves you can see from down here are empty.
123625: There's no need to wreck the place.
123678: The screwdriver is out of reach.
123729: After a rather precarious climb, accompanied by pressurised whining
from the support, you spot a previously hidden screwdriver on the top shelf.
123877: The shelves further up look extremely dangerous to stand on.
123965: Don't you think you'd better get down first?
124025: Touching bare wire whilst it's conducting hundreds of volts would
surely be a death wish.
124108: The socket is empty.
124139: There's a lightbulb in the socket already.
124305: As you swing the lightbulb, the period of its flickering becomes
shorter.
124363: The glass is warm.
124456: You are just about able to reach the lightbulb, the tiniest of turns
being enough to loosen it. The buildup of grease over the years has made the
lamp a slippery customer. As you clumsily lose your footing, the bulb flies out
of your hand. You try to catch it -- but its too late: the pearly glass
shatters on the storeroom floor.
124690: Looking at the glass from both the interior and exterior angles, it's
now clear just how much dust has settled. The lamp's tungsten filament
124863: You'd rather not cut your fingers; the glass fragments are probably
infected.
124927: There's not much left of the lamp as it is.
124974: It's not worth the effort to put the tungsten filament back.
125060: You pull the tungsten filament out of the broken contacts.
125106: The tungsten wire is still warm.
125231: The clasp on the bracelet has been welded shut, essentially making it
impossible to take off.
125301: The bracelet feels very cold.
125332: The clasp is impossible to undo.
125362: You can see a thin needle on the underside of the bracelet. Its point
is
125525: Dtuoqlhnin the hope of saving your life.
125578: The bracelet is too smooth for anything to stick to it.
125630: vlia,
Sensing an irritation, you reach for your wrist. The moment you
see it you freeze instantly. You relive the moment you discovered Rose, seeing
her face forever suspended in beauty -- her betrayed innocence -- the coppery
bracelet now on your left arm instead of hers.
125849: You've already taken care of the problem.
125892: You bend your left hand and slide the ringed washer under the bracelet,
making sure the hole doesn't coincide with the needle.
126220: And how do you plan on pulling off that trick?
126298: The key is made from a heavy metal, possibly lead. Three holes have
been drilled into the barrel at the opposite end to the ring.
126601: This is the current state of affairs:
126658: MIDDLE HOLE:
126683: INNER HOLE:
126870: You can see straight through the hole.
127221: Your finger won't fit through the hole.
127607: The room seems hauntingly familiar. The vivid memory of the power drill
"accident", as ever arranged by Tony, seems more recent than ever before. You
have been brought back to Saint Martins.
127746: Vandals have given the workroom a good going over, leaving their
multicoloured calling signs splattered across the damp walls. All of the easels
from the design area have either been stolen or trashed. To the north, stairs
lead up from the basement. The workshop extends in the other direction.
127959: The vandals have used permanent paint.
127993: Forget about it.
128019: You can't afford to waste time reading grafitti, especially such foul
language as this.
128082: You may as well ignore the paint.
128132: There's nothing more to find.
128163: You come across a sheet of tracing paper which might be more important
than the rest of the stuff here.
128239: You don't need snapped off bits of wood.
128275: Why?
128289: There's no reason to destroy what could prove to be useful information.
128350: You can't really see what it says unless you're holding it.
128393: One section in particular catches your eye -- a drawing of a box of
some kind. There appears to be some linked text:
128723: You can't see anything but darkness at the other end of the stairs.
128777: The stone steps have survived two world wars. Your puny efforts will
hardly make any difference.
128851: You're not a caretaker.
128922: You don't find anything useful.
128952: The finished articles were pretty useless even when they were intact.
129006: Natural degeneration has already done the damage.
129085: Inside the oven is a mould made from heat resistant clay.
129133: Somebody's taken the door for scrap metal.
129171: There's not much room underneath the kiln.
129242: The mould is a simple cylindrical groove set in heat resistant clay.
The groove's diameter is fixed, but its length can be altered using a sliding
scale calibrated in millimetres (currently set to
129411: Despite its resistance to heat, the mould is still way too hot to
touch.
129490: The mould is empty.
129703: The mould is fixed inside the kiln.
129760: There's already something in the groove.
130046: It's already at that setting.
130074: The groove can't be extended past 99 millimetres.
130211: The molten metal alters its shape to match the new dimensions of the
groove.
130313: You must specify which valve.
130351: The pipes are held in place by well secured steel rings.
130399: Don't be silly.
130575: The gas valve is in the open position.
130605: Saint MartinmAs you turn the gas valve into the open position, you hear
the roaring of flames underneath the kiln. The mould starts to glow red as the
temperature increases.
130758: You feel extreme heat coming from the molten liquid inside the groove.
130974: The gas valve isn't turned on.
130998: Saint MartinmYou close the valve, shutting off the gas supply to the
kiln.
131068: The molten metal cools noticably, but still remains in the liquid
state.
131143: An inbuilt safety feature prevents both valves being turned on at the
same time.
131200: As you switch on the water valve, the kiln interior is filled with
something resembling a miniature rainstorm.
131422: After five seconds of cooling, the water valve reverts back to its
former closed position automatically.
131503: The water valve is in its default closed position.
131765: The molten metal will be just fine on its own.
131798: You see no need to torture yourself.
131826: After about five metres, the corridor bends around to the south.
131895: The posters have lost any value they might have had.
131939: You didn't hate history that much.
131973: The writing has faded beyond recognition.
132004: These historical posters won't be of any use to you.
132050: Rumour has it the projector was imported from some World War Two
festival about thirteen years ago. There are no cables; its power source is
internal. The smallest of control panels provides the overused advance button
and two black dials.
132247: The projector is too bulky to move around.
132286: If you want to turn one of the dials, you'll have to say which you
mean.
132344: Big Jim's spirit doesn't seem to have left this room, and you don't
particular feel like angering the fat one -- he was bad enough in human form.
132456: The only controls are the two black dials and the advance button.
132511: You can't find anything on the projector to open.
132553: The viewer is clear enough to see through already.
132960: . At the edge of the image there is a caption:
133066: It might actually work properly if you pushed it.
133120: Nothing more seems to happen.
133342: . On the side of the projector a cleverly concealed panel swings open,
a green plastic figurine tumbling onto the floor. The opening automatically
closes, blending in seemlessly with the surrounding metal casing.
133619: The only response from the antique projector is the unsettling sound of
machinery whirring.
133714: The larger of the two black dials has settings ranging from 1 to 20.
Someone has scratched the letter
133793: on the plastic surface. The dial is currently set to the number
133894: The dial is an integral part of the projector.
133932: No amount of rubbing will remove the scratch.
133980: The only settings available are the numbers 1 through 20.
134032: The dial is already set to that.
134130: The larger dial's tiny counterpart has the greater range of settings,
numbering 1 to 100. Currently set to
134307: The tippex is impossible to rub out.
134342: Dials are supposed to be turned.
134382: That particular setting isn't available.
134546: Your bid to escape the prerecorded torture probably wouldn't meet with
much success. The sounds of terror echo around Saint Martins' empty corridors.
134666: The controls for the speakers must be somewhere else.
134733: The sound system is even out of throwing range.
134768: The ceiling is over ten metres above your head.
134833: axn
Your enemy resumes control of the unseen microphone: "Joanna has a
message for you -- isn't that right, dear?"

Five seconds of silence.

"How do
you put up with someone so stubborn, Charlie? Oh, I forgot -- she's rich. Maybe
you won't be so keen on dating her after I perform a little surgery."

The
sound of metal being sharpened -- followed by another period of long silence.
135121: "There was a man named Oscar....."

Joanna's calm and beautiful singing
voice is hesitant.
135200: "Please...."

"Don't beg -- sing. What's the matter? Do you think
you're someone special -- just because you walk around in pretty silk dresses
and have a five-figure credit limit? Underneath all the gloss, you're not much
different from me. You have legs, arms, eyes -- at least for now. You might
like to know that so far I've only tested my blade on virgins, but I'm not one
for sticking to formulas. Now, when you're feeling comfortable, would you like
to try again?"
135554: Joanna resumes her singing with enforced vigour.
135646: "Unfortunately, Joanna seems a little tired. I took my time to write
out the lyrics, just in case you need any more clues. You'd better hurry
Charlie -- Joanna is catching a cold. Warming her up is notion which is ....
appealing."

One of the speakers rotates downwards. A sheet of music nestling
on top slides off, landing on the ground nearby.
135939: cibfpm
Intermittent crackling of static soon escalates into high
pitched squealing. Like in endless tuesday afternoon concertos, the speakers
amplify the sound to dramatic effect. The voice of your enemy is reproduced so
clearly you can't be sure whether you're still alone.

"Are you enjoying your
first day at school, Charlie? It must be cold and depressing being alone in
such a filthy place. I thought a little company might cheer you up."

"
136260: "

Joanna's voice, instantly recognisable, is infused with pure fear.
Her screaming cry for help resonates around the room.
136361: The song must be important if the psycho made Joanna write it out; you
should keep it handy.
136474: "There was once a man named Oscar,
Who spent his days looking out of
the window.
Along came Bonnie Prince Charlie,
In search of his beloved Jo."
136588: "Oscar cried 'You'll need my help,
So will you set me free?'
'I will
indeed,' said Charlie,
'If you tell me where to find the key.'"
136696: whn"'Bring me a diamond earring made from purest gold!
That will do for
starters.
Fetch me a plain bronze bracelet.
No! I'm not prepared to barter.'"
136810: vhn"'And finally, the finest platinum necklace,
For my darling
wife.
Inlaid with a triplet of glittering rubies,
To end your trouble and
strife.'"
136930: The corridor bends around to the east.
137067: Notice boards are meant for looking at.
137134: .

The article goes on to describe the gruesome find and link it with
three recent disappearances. Police have provided a photograph of the murdered
girl: a local nightclub stripper with the stage name of Jade.
137291: Her missing head is the one you found in the plastic dispenser -- and
Joanna might well be the next victim.
137368: There is some speculation about it being the work of a serial killer.
137425: It's not the type of subject matter you like carrying around with you.
137495: Tearing up the news article won't change the past.
137711: Rather fittingly, the face shows the time to be eleven o'clock.
137771: The clock is too heavy.
137797: There's no space underneath the clock.
137862: The door has already been opened.
137895: Lifelong pressure on the hinges has taken its toll. A groaning creak
signals the end of the brackets and the door comes loose of the framework,
resting in a partially open position.
138030: You'll never get the door back onto its hinges.
138065: The door on front of the clock is in the closed position.
138113: There's no keyhole.
138135: It'll take more than you have to get the dirt off the glass.
138188: The glass door is too dirty to see through.
138226: In the middle of the broken cogs and spindles, you see an iron spring
in relatively good shape.
138293: Just useless cogs and spindles.
138323: Mechanical devices aren't one of your strong spots. Nothing you can do
will get the clock working again.
138426: The iron spring easily comes apart from the clock's mechanism. Your
actions have disturbed the clock's dormant state, a hidden bell chiming softly
inside -- eleven times.
138631: The wax candles burned up all their fuel long ago, leaving a depressing
sense of loss in their wake.
138702: Candles burn all day long, a reminder of those who gave their lives to
make the world a better place.
138829: The war memorial is only supposed to be looked at.
138866: Even the vandals left the war memorial plaque alone; you should show
the same respect.
138935: The wire framework of the window has started to come loose, fracturing
the century old glass.
139000: The design of the window depicts Saint Martin, the college's eternal
patron.
139074: The skies overhead are filled with dark grey clouds.
139111: The window looks pretty underneath the blazing sunlight.
139157: The rest of the hall is underneath the window.
139190: The window is part of the roof, many metres above you.
139239: You're not quite that small.
139267: All you see outside is a puddle-laden mudpit, an example of what lack
of proper attention can do to a perfectly good playing field.
139366: You may as well forget it; your guess is it would take hours to open up
a large enough hole -- time which you don't have.
139458: The plaster is moist.
139482: The cracks don't have the ability to hold anything.
139522: Now deprived of its user, the desk has lost much of its identity. The
new addition of the goldfish bowl goes some way towards destroying its
reputation as the Devil's abode, firmly established from your very first day at
Saint Martins.
139694: The drawer is closed.
139711: The drawer has been yanked open.
139751: Your weak strength and the weight of the desk make it impossible to
lift.
139809: You aren't even able to scratch the mahogany desk.
139879: Worms crawl on the floor, and you certainly don't belong to that
family.
139966: The table lamp has been screwed down.
140016: The cable goes taut as you lift up the table lamp.
140058: On closer inspection you see the bowl is made from plastic. There are
no goldfish inside:
140225: Floating in the middle of them is a human hand, severed at the wrist
and picked clean by the seaborne vultures.
140319: Whoever put the goldfish bowl here sealed it in place with very strong
superglue.
140407: The goldfish bowl remains stuck to the table.
140459: You carefully place the table lamp inside the goldfish bowl.
140503: Eyou ixm For a few seconds you can see bright blue electrical discharge
inside the water.
140656: You can't see underneath it.
140684: There's no way to empty the water.
140723: With the piranha still inside the goldfish bowl, putting your hand in
is not such a great idea.
140796: Alas, you are not a goldfish.
140863: You don't want your hand to end up like that poor unfortunate's
floating in the bowl.
140940: Your hands won't do much damage against the piranha.
141008: All the piranha want is food -- preferably you.
141048: The piranha show no reaction, but then why would they?
141102: This is one situation your fast mouth won't get you out of.
141180: The piranha make a sudden dash for the open air in a frenzied attempt
to escape their fate, but it is to no avail. Death for the killer fish is
practically immediate; their bodies float to the surface.
141330: The piranha have gnawed right down to the bone, removing every last
piece of flesh.
141396: A purple plastic figurine is clutched in the skeletal fingers.
141514: Too late, you realise you have left the table lamp in the goldfish bowl
switched on. The electric shock is strong enough to burn out your brain, but
before it does you visualise Joanna being subjected to a terrifying ordeal by
the clown masked psychopath.
141706: Mercifully for both you and the soul of the unknown victim, the purple
figurine comes free almost right away.
141783: Looking at the abhoration is bad enough.
141829: The piranha float on top of the water.
141870: You might as well ignore the piranha -- they were never particularly
considerate about what they ate.
141951: The antiquated table lamp dangles from its cable.
141999: The table lamp has been dropped in the goldfish bowl.
142038: In some ways the lead eagles that form the lamp's base resemble the old
headmaster: dull and lifeless with long, pointy claws. The lightbulb socket is
empty.
142169: You can't really go anywhere while you're holding the table lamp.
142238: You've already unscrewed the lamp.
142288: You can't get the screw out with your hands.
142369: After a bit of pressure, the screw comes loose and rolls onto the desk.
142445: The bronze screw is already in place.
142488: You don't have the screw handy right now.
142538: That might work better if the lamp was on the desk.
142580: You can't really get the screw back in without using the screwdriver.
142634: You screw the table lamp back down onto the desk.
142713: Maybe you should concentrate on getting the screw out.
142802: You can't just simply take the screw out.
142844: The table lamp is already switched on.
142988: Sarah 5nThe power is off already.
143012: Saint MartinnYou switch off the table lamp.
143180: The drawer is quite clearly open already.
143214: The drawer comes off its runners half way out, jamming in a half open
position.
143290: Judging by the state of the drawer, force is probably not required.
143349: The drawer is jammed in a half open position.
143405: It's no use. You can't unjam it.
143446: The drawer doesn't have a lock.
143487: You were always taught to take good care of receipts.
143739: Apparently, the headmaster decided to spend some of his retirement
bonus early.
143807: Baked beans -- yuk.
143845: How to turn it on is the most frequently asked question.
143891: You spent seven years trying to figure out how to do just that, and you
still haven't worked it out.
143970: The radiator wobbles slightly, but not enough to make any worthwhile
difference.
144032: The radiator feels colder than the rest of this place.
144071: Just leave the radiator alone.
144105: The lock is broken.
144125: The satchel's strap is missing.
144155: Leather was always pretty tough to break through.
144264: The laser pistol won't reach that far.
144298: It won't reach.
144326: This room always did smell of foul body sweat.
144359: You're deliberately avoiding smelling the perfume.
144422: Force is useless against such an obstacle.
144497: You'll have to unlock the padlock first.
144542: You deliberately avoid looking at the perfume bottle when you open the
locker.
144605: The first thing you see when you open the locker is the perfume. Pink
Petal -- the same brand Sarah used that night.
144729: You should close the locker first.
144774: You slam the door shut on the bottle of perfume.
144882: You never were any good at removing stickers.
144982: You can't bear to even look at the perfume.
145058: The key seems to be missing some vital components.
145120: The key gets stuck about a third of the way in.
145168: The key gets roughly half way in before it jams.
145216: About two thirds of the way into the padlock, the key gets stuck.
145302: The key fits loosely inside the padlock, but refuses to turn.
145362: The key fits perfectly, but won't turn.
145401: The key turns, and the padlock snaps open.
145435: You relock the padlock on the titanium locker.
145479: Lethal chemical fumes couldn't be much worse.
145517: Sounds of knives scraping and pupil small tank still linger in the
memory.
145594: The glass shelves have been cleared of food; green mould grows in large
patches. Amazingly, the plastic drinks dispenser still has something in it.
145711: The refrigerator has been disconnected.
145745: The fridge hasn't been switched on in three years -- not that it ever
made the food any fresher.
145831: Years worth of muck.
145853: Cleaning up this mess is an impossible task.
145893: You now have a choice in the matter -- an easy one to make.
145969: The refrigerator is a student version -- apparently they don't need
doors.
146039: The fridge is way too heavy to move.
146073: Things placed in this refrigerator are likely to contract the black
plague.
146131: Ufk :nIt's not a pleasant sight.
146158: Every day at school you had to use one of these; most of the time
queuing up was spent deciding which juice looked the least dangerous to risk.
In that respect, the blackcurrant juice inside is surprisingly strong in
colour. There's a tap on front of the dispenser.
146357: Ufk :nLet the dead rest in peace.
146403: The dispenser is filled with blackcurrant juice.
146447: You never could find any opening -- perhaps it was factory produced
along with the contents.
146517: The plastic is too tough to break through.
146553: You don't fancy carrying around a momento of Saint Martins' tasteless
drinks.
146618: You don't even want to touch the juice, let alone drink it.
146666: The plastic is actually cold -- odd.
146782: The juice is too dark to see through.
146809: The juice is inside the container.
146849: You still wish you'd never touched it.
146878: The tap is used to empty the dispenser -- never a bad idea.
146929: The plastic tap is part of the dispenser.
146983: There's no liquid inside -- just the unmentionable horror.
147038: The juice empties from the dispenser, draining away through steel
gratings in the floor. Red strands of hair, stained purple by artificial
colourings, float above the lowering meniscus. Soon the full extent of the
unveiling horror becomes terrifyingly clear. The size of the container takes on
a new importance when you realise the hair is still attached to the woman's
scalp. Citric acid has dissolved whole portions of her face.

Your only comfort
is the eyes staring back at you from the decomposed flesh don't belong to
Joanna. The psycho has written a message in purple crayon:
147469: That won't change anything now.
147494: The tap isn't in the open position.
147567: These things were always easy to open.
147607: Despite most of her face having rotted away, you recognise Jade: the
nightclub stripper from the newspaper article.
147688: You don't recognise the woman's face.
147745: The message sends a shudder down your spine.
147783: Just the head; the rest of the body is missing.
147825: It's too late to help her now.
147848: Thankfully, the severed head is behind plastic.
147896: The kitchen has been ransacked, leaving you with no potential
distractions from the macabre addition to the cutting table. Perhaps the psycho
was responsible for the clearout, a deliberate attempt to keep you focused on
the personalised death message.
148081: Saint MartinmYour attention immediately becomes fixed on the cutting
table. The woman's clothing has been slashed to pieces exposing her naked body.
Jagged lettering has been carved into her torso; the message is addressed to
you.
148276: More blood.
148303: Even if you wanted to touch the table, you couldn't move it.
148355: You'd get covered in her blood.
148387: The corpse takes up all the room.
148418: The cutting table isn't something you want to play around with.
148501: You already know what the message says.
148535: She's already dead.
148552: Touching the corpse would make you as sadistic as the psychopath.
148610: If you had to guess you'd say the uniform was originally khaki
coloured. It's the kind of dress shop assistants wear at work. A badge fixed on
the lapel identifies the victim:
148757: What kind of man are you?
148822: Chilled air escapes from the open freezer room door, leaving trails of
condensation in its wake.
148891: The door to the north does little to restore your confidence -- it
leads to the freezer room.
148969: The freezer room door doesn't have a lock.
149012: And let the psycho lock you in here, laughing while you freeze to
death?
149076: The warmth of the kitchens lies beyond.
149105: The freezer room -- chilling in more ways than one.
149296: The icicles are just scenery.
149330: Plastic bags have been loaded onto the belt, stacked in unstable tower
formations. Their contents are displayed on sticky paper labels, though
condensation prevents you from seeing inside.
149479: The conveyor belt's as dead as the woman next door.
149521: The conveyor belt isn't switched on.
149555: The conveyor belt is full of food bags.
149591: There's no room to maneuver.
149639: You can't move the belt by hand.
149824: -- normal working hours. The name entered in the "employee" field is
149913: Would you want an inconsiderate stranger to drag your body around?
149960: There doesn't seem to be an opening, and the plastic is too tough to
break through.
150038: The woman has already suffered more harm than you can imagine.
150088: You don't find anything.
150119: The polythene exteriors are covered in condensation.
150156: A woman's face, frozen in fear, stares back at you through the
polythene.
150232: Rubbing the bag won't make what's inside go away.
150274: Clearing away the condensation exposes a badly burned corpse. Fearing
the worst you clean the surface of the other bags, but they contain only food.
150426: Ice cold.
150453: She's wearing a factory manager's uniform covered in huge blotches of
oil.
150511: You probably don't want to know what horrors lie underneath the
uniform.
150567: The woman is no longer suffering.
150592: The woman is behind a sheet of polythene.
150653: This isn't the place for messing around.
150684: The college butchers must have been tall -- the hooks are well beyond
your reach.
150759: The freezer isn't something you can move.
150800: You'll have to open it first.
150830: You can't avoid the woman's ice cold gaze.
150863: Tons of ice, broken up into serviceable pieces just a little too
neatly.
150919: It still feels cold despite the low ambient temperature.
150967: There isn't a switch in sight.
151002: Putting things on the freezer won't help.
151040: You should leave the woman's death bed alone.
151107: You have a peculiar idea of fun.
151143: The pressure difference causes air to sweep into the room as you open
the freezer unit. You hear the hooks behind you tingling as they swing to and
fro.
151286: You don't know who's been touching it.
151344: You've uncovered enough secrets.
151374: In the light of recent events, the discovery shouldn't be so shocking.
Yet you still take a step backwards when you find the body. Again the victim is
female, and again the method of murder makes the psycho you're dealing with
seem capable of anything.
151593: Only her appointment book -- the rest of the body has been stripped
naked.
151676: Let the dead rest in peace.
151699: Saint MartinmBloody red handprints are smeared across the gold typeface
displaying the girl's name:
151773: . The leather cover carries the blue and gold logo of Coopers -- the
city's prestigious sports agents.
151861: You shouldn't go looking through dead people's things.
151902: Let her keep the book -- you don't need it.
151941: a   XmWhen the college governors funded the construction of the new
laboratory extension, they allegedly had problems procuring the finance. Late
night secret accounts examinations show that to be a ludicrous excuse for low
investment -- perhaps they were only interested in their personal bank
balances.

You pause for a few seconds, something going through your mind but
not quite registering. Shaking off the uneasy feeling, you continue up the
stairs.
152293: That won't ease the pain of spending seven years here.
152332: It's bad enough just to look at the coat of arms.
152377: Nobody responds to your banging.
152410: The iron bar blocking the exit has been riveted into place. It seems
you're stuck in Saint Martins playing games with a psychopath.
152508: It'll take more than a key to open this door -- even dynamite might not
work.
152570: There are no keyholes to look through.
152604: The iron bar looks like it's staying put.
152640: There's no chance of getting out with the iron bar still in place.
152695: What would be the point?
152721: Sports teams aren't important unless they want sponsorship.
152783: There's nothing hidden behind the photographs.
152833: This case must have been brought here after the hooligan raid; it's too
expensive (and tough) to have come out of the headmaster's kitty.
152939: That's controlled from the keypad.
153002: What do you want to type on the keypad?
153051: The keypad's interior circuitry is inaccessible.
153137: Limit your inputs to numbers between 1 and 9999.
153184: The buttons glow red the moment you touch them, and shortly afterwards
the display case slides back into a locked position.
153413: on the keypad, the buttons glow red. The display case remains locked.
153474: The response to entering the third number is a green glow from the
buttons. The display case swings open.
153651: That wouldn't do any good; the glass is specially designed to be
unbreakable.
153716: Even if you could reach the windows, the toughened glass would be an
impassable barrier.
153787: The windows are all too high up to reach.
153906: The slab is raised about an inch above the ground.
153946: Saint MartinmThe six slabs are all pretty similar: raised circles of
rock about a metre in diameter. They vary in colour, this one being made from
154049: . Each of them is also engraved with its own unique images, in this
particular case they depict
154137: There's no way the slab is coming back up out of the ground unless it
wants to.
154225: The separation between the slabs and the rest of the floor is so narrow
you can't even see the joints.
154308: The slab won't go any further into the ground.
154383: Maybe you'd better clear the surface first.
154429: There's barely enough room for you to stand on the slab.
154601: You doubt any of them would come in handy.
154639: Have some respect. Besides, the photographs could actually be worth
something one day.
154715: Nothing is hidden underneath.
154738: The photographs aren't very important.
154783: The pivot has rusted, locking the telescopes in position.
154841: The tubes are filled with shattered glass -- all that's left of the
lenses.
154907: Somebody's already done a good job at that.
154947: Sliding objects along broken telescope tubes is a waste of time and
energy.
155000: There are more interesting things to do than fiddle with broken
telescopes.
155063: The globe is one thing that wasn't here five years ago, and the same
can be said of the six stone slabs around the room's perimeter.
155158: The globe has stopped rotating, having split open along the equator.
155215: The globe is the standard spherical map of the Earth, but there's
nothing ordinary about the colouring: crimson red seas surround land masses
moulded from brown clay. Everything rotates slowly around the axis, a stainless
steel skewer passing through the poles. Arranged in a ring formation around the
globe are six evenly spaced stone slabs.
155452: The globe has opened up along the equator.
155526: It's not obvious how to do that; perhaps the stone slabs are the key.
155588: The two halves of the globe refuse to budge.
155659: The globe has opened up.
155678: You can't see any gaps on the globe.
155741: The globe isn't transparent.
156026: rise back into their original positions. The globe continues its slow
axial rotation.
156108: descends to floor level, the globe stops rotating. Soon afterwards it
splits into two equal halves, revealing a red plastic figurine inside.
156233: You don't find anything more of interest.
156269: Looking through the pile, you come across a dot matrix printout that
catches your attention -- the ink is a little too fresh.
156363: The computers have passed their sell by date.
156403: There are easy ways to carry out searches.
156441: There's enough junk here already.
156479: None of the equipment is operational.
156531: There's nothing to be found here.
156569: Nothing useful is hidden amongst the cages.
156633: There's no need to act like you're trapped.
156673: The door hinges are most non-functional.
156713: Nothing but piles of blank exercise books.
156751: There are better places to store things.
156788: That would leave you with a bad back and nothing to show for your
troubles.
156846: You've seen enough exercise books in your lifetime.
156930: You give one of the seperators a tug, and the board revolves around to
the next section.
156998: The markings could be important.
157030: Violence isn't what's needed here.
157064: You'd have to be superhuman to move that thing around.
157108: Mathematics equations:
157457: You see no reason to destroy the document.
157498: The writing is so faint you can only read it up close.
157540: DEFUSE CODE:
158014: It's one of the few clues you have.
158048: The holes aren't that large.
158074: The bench was the main work area for electronics students when the
college was still open. The gas taps, a hangover from its chemistry days, have
been disconnected.
158207: About a metre away from the explosive and its partner contraptions is a
two terminal charge transfer tube.
158287: There's no more space on the workbench.
158329: Underneath the laboratory bench is a piece of graph paper.
158370: No sign of anything else underneath.
158402: The workbench is thick, but it won't do any good against so much
explosive.
158470: The workbench is fixed in place.
158502: You hardly dare breath with what's sitting on top of bench. This isn't
the time to be fooling around.
158578: Enough plastic explosive to finish off Saint Martins for good is packed
into a space the size of a tub of margarine. Four wires connect the bomb to
other devices: a circuit board, a switch box, a set of lamps and a pair of
electronic scales.
158777: Touching highly explosive devices is sheer lunacy.
158840: Curious to see what will happen, you give the explosive a good thump.
The explosion is so fast and devastating you never see it coming.
158954: There are four switches in the box; their current configuration is:
159008: SQUARE:
159027: CIRCLE:
159046: OCTAGON:
159067: CROSS:
159123: Which switch do you want to press?
159156: The switch box is attached to the workbench.
159311: The set of lamps is firmly attached to the workbench.
159357: A second glance at the bomb makes you reconsider.
159430: All of the lamps are switched on.
159468: Saint MartinnYou switch all three of the lamps on.
159523: None of the lamps are turned on at the moment.
159569: Saint MartinnYou switch off all of the lights.
159602: The circuit board is inlaid with a maze of copper intersections,
resistors and cells.
159670: One microchip in the centre looks particularly important though.
159715: The microchip has been removed.
159759: The circuit board is fixed in place.
159899: You replace the microchip.
159922: You recognise the scales as one of the very accurate types, sensitive
to even the smallest alteration of air pressure. The digital readout has been
disabled, and all of the buttons removed except one labelled
160103: The scales seem very sensitive, and considering their connections, you
should keep well away.
160210: You breathe a sigh of relief -- the bomb doesn't go off.
160298: , the electronic scales start to emit a worrying sequence of beeps. In
such a confined area, you become trapped in the searing hot fireball that
follows the bomb's detonation. As your skin begins to burn away, you wonder
where you went wrong.
160482: The button cannot be removed.
160762: Moving electric equipment around is unsafe at the best of times.
160878: Both terminals are unconnected.
161135: You must specify which terminal.
161498: The charge transfer tube glows for roughly half a second.
161626: You remove the microchip from the circuit board.
161841: You should be careful: electronic components are very fragile.
161953: The terminals cannot be removed from the tube.
162122: There's already something on that terminal.
162298: Modern silicon microchips are so small they will soon become
microscopic. This one is about the size of a pea, with a charge meter on the
front.
162418: Current Charge Level:
162489: Sarah :nThe lamp is currently off.
162514: The lamp is currently switched on.
162561: No amount of force is going to remove the lamp from its socket.
162611: Smashing the lightbulb might not be considered wise in the present
company.
162826: The switch forms one of a set of four, all of which vary only in shape.
This one is
162907: Sarah Xnin a raised position.
163121: Sarah XnThat switch isn't on.
163200: The lights are on the ceiling.
163233: The cupboards are shattered wrecks.
163267: Nothing to find.
163286: Playing around with empty cupboards won't help you find Joanna.
163709: as you place the figurine inside. Colour spreads partially along the
optical fibre
163994: The chandelier's inverted modules are all made from the same
transparent plastic. An exterior ring supports three hemispheres, each linked
to its two closest cone neighbours on the inner circuit with optical fibres.
These in turn are all connected to a centrally located pyramid.
164244: The chandelier is too well supported to take with you.
164288: You don't find anything.
164451: All of the modules are empty.
164524: The network of fibres hold the chandelier immobile.
164566: The chandelier is made from plastic.
164600: The fibres have taken all the fun out of swinging on chandeliers.
165063: Optical fibres link it to the three cones on the interior ring.
165124: The surface of the pyramid isn't transparent.
165171: The pyramid has already opened up.
165196: The surface of the plastic pyramid is seamless.
165242: The plastic pyramid seems reluctant to close.
165356: There's not enough room inside the pyramid.
165411: The pyramid in the centre closes up.
165497: As you place the final figurine, the pyramid's faces swing outwards.
166060: plastic. There aren't too many distinguishing features, though the
person represented is quite clearly female. On the base is a septagonal light
sensitive pad.
166649: Your hands are full.
166725: Your attention is focused on the falling shutters.
166767: Resigned to your fate, you wait for the inevitable end to come.
166824: You're underneath them!
166843: What's underneath the steel shutters is more worrying.
166887: The sound of approaching death.
166910: There is no time to do anything -- you are trapped.
167140: The city plan is behind a layer of glass.
167178: A plan of the city hangs in place of the timetable, lit up from behind.
167238: Connected to the glass via ringed tubing is every youngster's dream
toy: a laser pistol.
167306: The plan shows the city's central business district and surrounding
suburbs. Streets and buildings are represented by thin black lines. Next to the
map is a computer screen running the latest version of Windows.
167698: None of the buildings strike you as odd.
167727: The diagram is no longer plain and boring.
167814: The glass remains intact.
167838: There's no opening on the glass.
167870: The plan is fixed to the wall.
167981: The icon doesn't respond to your touch.
168017: It's only a computerised graphic -- you can't take it.
168433: There are no icons in the window.
168657: Other than the light gun, you don't see any other means of control.
168719: There is a slight dissipation of static.
168769: Punching in the screen might be a big mistake.
168821: The computer screen is impenetratable.
168865: Too similar to be a coincidence.
168890: The tie looks familiar -- but you can't quite place it.
168946: It might be entirely different from the devastating weapon so often
described in science fiction, but the principle is much the same: a beam of
light is fired from the nozzle. Around the barrel are a series of
169140: You're not holding the laser pistol.
169167: What exactly do you want to shoot?
169212: The gun swings on its tubing a couple of times before coming to rest.
169296: It might help to have a particular building in mind.
169338: Aiming laser guns at yourself is a dangerous game to play.
169393: Nothing much appears to happen.
169667: Xtlka ExnYou need to be holding the figurine to get in a good shot.
170097: Nothing seems to change.
170138: You'd better put down the laser pistol first.
170231: The laser pistol returns to its former position, dangling on the end of
its connecting tubing.
170319: The shutters are locked down in position.
170350: You've already opened the shutters.
170387: The shutters are down.
170416: The shutters are too heavy to move.
170450: The shutters don't have a visible lock.
170489: There's no way to see what's behind them from here.
170528: The shutters are closed.
170564: Useless.
170602: The dull sound of bone striking steel.
170641: Yeah, right.
170657: You get down on your knees and crawl underneath the steel barrier. The
machinery jerks into motion when you are partway through -- the shutters will
split you in half!
170800: The steel shutters have moved about a foot above the ground.
170874: Sweat pouring down your face, you wait for the fatal blow. It never
comes -- the steel shutters have halted inches from your waistline. The psycho
seems amused by your predicament.

"Did you really think I'd let you go through
all that for nothing? Joanna and I have been waiting for you. Do you know what
her final request was?
171505: The psychopath's voice booms down the corridor.

"I get the impression
you're guessing, Charlie Boy. You haven't actually identified all the people
you claim to know so well. Perhaps you should take another look at my work --
bodies without names don't have anywhere near the same impact."
171722: The steel shutters rise about a foot before the winching machinery
switches off, leaving you with the tiniest of crawlspaces to get through.

Your
enemy's voice travels the distance between here and room Twelve without losing
any of its inherent nastiness.

"What are you afraid of, Charlie? There's even
enough room for someone with your fat cat stomach to squeeze through."
172001: Saint Martinn
The sound of the chiming clock arouses you from surreal
daydreaming. It's eleven o'clock, midway through the examination which you
finished in a record forty two minutes. For once you were deliberately rushing.
Colin coughs three times -- the signal you've been waiting for. Behind you
somewhere, Joanna is waiting expectantly.

You're having second thoughts --
cheating was never an option. Thinking about the objective, helping Colin to
pass his most crucial exam, doesn't make everything perfectly sound. At least
there's another reason for doing this sitting underneath your examination
paper.
172462: Big Jim and Smith could turn round at any moment.
172499: You are to remain seated until the examination finishes.
172556: Talking is not permitted in examinations.
172599: All quiet on the examination front.
172626: Apart from Big Jim's heavy footsteps, there is nothing but silence.
172682: The desks smell of methylated spirit.
172716: Signalling visually is a little too obvious.
172761: You've already given the go ahead to Joanna -- now it's time to help
Colin!
172860: You cough three times, the signal previously arranged with your
co-conspirators. Joanna carries out the most important stage of the plan -- an
all important diverson. The loud crashing noise succeeds in attracting
everyone's attention. Colin holds out his hands in anticipation.
173085: You don't want his attention.
173115: That's not part of the plan.
173144: It's Colin who wants to cheat, not you.
173183: Nothing useful.
173201: You might well get splinters.
173237: Making deliberate noise in an examination could easily ruin your
chances of success.
173358: The clock is on the opposite side of the room.
173399: Joanna is sitting behind you, and it's simply too risky to turn round
during an exam. In any case, the signal isn't visual.
173488: Joanna has caused the distraction, smashing her calculator on the
floor.
173572: Joanna is too far away.
173600: Big Jim and Smith have stopped pacing about the room to investigate the
disturbance.
173712: Everyone's attention is directed towards Joanna. You'll never get a
better opportunity to pass the information to Colin.
173825: Joanna is too far away for that.
173864: Sarah 5nWith everybody watching?
173887: It's Colin that needs the information so badly.
173930: Colin is sitting two desks to your left.
173968: He's a nervous wreck, depending wholly on you and Joanna for his
future.
174021: He's gesticulating at you, urging you to go ahead with the plan.
174127: Colin is not within reach.
174161: You can't reach Colin from where you're sitting.
174218: Doing that in plain sight would be academic suicide.
174258: ahm
You toss the pack of mints over to Colin. To this day, you've never
been able to explain why you got involved at all. The consequences of his
mistake were devastating.

Colin lost his footing and slipped, the pack of
mints striking him squarely on the head. Murphy's laws were all in force -- the
packet rolled open, incriminating contents visible for all to see. Big Jim's
unforgiving stare spelled out the end result long before the governors made
their ruling. Colin was immediately expelled without recommendation. 

You
recall staying behind afterwards, watching Joanna's outpour of grief. On the
way out you paused to pick up the twenty pound note from under the question
sheet.
174763: Big Jim's face is serious, scanning the room for any signs of cheating.
174825: From behind, you can see Big Jim's neatly trimmed grey hair.
174870: Big Jim is behind you.
174903: His infamous black polished shoes.
174958: Big Jim isn't next to you at the moment.
175033: This isn't the time to develop a moral conscience!
175113: Have you lost your mind?
175132: Throwing things at teachers is not recommended.
175279: Big Jim bends down to grasp the fountain pen in his double width
fingers. He tosses it back onto your desk, keeping a stern expression on his
face. Regaining control of his temper, he gives you a rare smile before walking
off. The delay upset the teacher's marching rhythm -- Smith has already turned
around.
175498: The floor vibrates as Big Jim stomps past where you're sitting.
175552: Big Jim executes a military style u-turn on the spot, advancing towards
the rear of the hall.
175644: You can't see Smith -- he's behind you.
175677: All you can make out from over here is his horrible brown jumper.
175753: His shoes are not quite so polished as Big Jim's.
175790: Smith is patrolling the opposite end of the room.
175833: All Smith ever wanted was his maths homework titles underlined in
pencil.
175891: That would be plain stupidity.
175985: Smith reaches the front of the hall, turning around almost immediately
to head back.
176053: Smith is now at a position level with your desk.
176125: line of sight. He'd surely notice the "accident" to be quite
deliberate.
176250: Pretty standard college furnishings.
176303: There's no room to hide in here.
176333: No sign of any chewing gum, thankfully.
176377: The heat has left you too exhausted to move the desk.
176438: Careful -- you don't want to arouse any suspicions.
176477: You have the answers in a much more compact form.
176521: The pen doesn't need refilling.
176551: The ink cartridge is over half full.
176597: The pen has sentimental value.
176625: That would be highly dangerous.
176672: The pen rolls off the edge of the desk onto the floor nearby.
176715: Dropping the pen a second time would draw too much attention.
176775: You don't want to do anything too suspicious, just in case anything
goes wrong.
176839: The answer booklet is full of mathematical formulae.
176884: There's no need to worry -- your reward's still hidden underneath the
question paper.
176954: No need to ruin all your perfectly good work.
176999: Inside the silver wrapper you have written information about commonly
used equations and symbols.
177079: You didn't bring the mints here to eat.
177115: You check the seal on the pack of mints once more.
177157: That would ruin the entire plan.
177187: Whatever happens, you don't want to take the rap for what's inside the
pack of mints.
177286: The calculator has served its purpose.
177327: Pleasant oriental music fills the air.
177361: The smell of delicious food is a satisfying change.
177403: It would be impolite to leave Sarah on her own.
177443: Save your violence for Tony -- you'll need it.
177485: You shouldn't really throw things on the floor.
177543: Sarah polishes off the last of the excellent meal, pushing her plate to
the centre of the table. A waiter interrupts, delivering a wine bottle and a
single crystal glass. Mumbling an apology, he rushes off to serve another
customer -- it must be someone with more prestige. Determined not to let
anything get to you tonight, you reluctantly let him off the hook.

Sarah gives
you that look again, fluttering her eyelids. You catch a whiff of her expensive
perfume as she leans forward.

"So darling, are you going to do the honours?"
177942: The fishtanks are just scenery.
177991: "I always leave pouring the drinks to men."
178032: Sarah seems to prefer action to talking.
178067: Sarah XnNow is not the time.
178096: You haven't quite got over the first kiss yet.
178137: All the barriers come down; you succomb to Sarah's irresistable charm.
Both your lips come together and in that one moment everything clicks into
place -- you're looking at the perfect partner. You barely notice someone walk
past and toss an unopened fortune cookie onto your table. Time stands still,
waiting for one of you to ask the final question.
178391: Sarah looks more than a little perplexed at your suggestion.
178447: Sarah puts a hand to her mouth.

"Let's see what fate has in store,
shall we?"
178537: "Why not pour a little, and we'll see?"
178568: "Don't worry about that -- there's more interesting things to get your
teeth into."
178642: It's not polite to discuss other women during a romantic evening out.
178709: "I think pretty much the same as you."
178767: "Teachers are all mad, don't you think."
178809: "You know enough about me."
178843: "I'll keep my thoughts on you to myself."
178898: "It was gorgeous."
178933: "Pretty good, apart from that lousy waiter."
178977: "Let's not waste time talking about him."
179019: "I'm leaving that to you."
179060: "It was a present from my mother."
179087: "I'm not quite with you."
179140: "Don't worry -- I won't bite."
179174: "What are you waiting for, Charlie? Another woman to come along?"
179251: "We shouldn't really let good wine go to waste, Charlie."
179301: Sarah gives the wine bottle a long glance.
179408: "I'd rather watch you do that -- you have such delicate hands."
179477: "I'd rather watch you do that -- you have such delicate hands."
179539: "Why -- have you got a dirty little secret?"
179580: "What's the rush? The film doesn't start for two hours."
179647: "Hadn't you better pour some wine first?"
179698: "Is that all you're interested in?"
179735: The sapphire brooch she wears is quite stunning.
179802: Scraping stools around might be acceptable in Sharples' chemistry
lessons, but not here.
179870: There's nothing underneath the chair.
179904: You're already sitting down.
179932: Sarah would never forgive you if you went crawling around the
furniture.
179996: Sarah might get upset if you did that again.
180032: "What's up Charlie -- have you never seen a pair of legs before?"

You
cough in embarassment, but Sarah decides to let it pass.
180140: Even a luxury restaurant can't afford to take chances in this city;
they've nailed the table to the floor.
180237: Have you lost your mind?
180270: The restaurant staff will clean up.
180313: Joanna is wearing Sarah's old sapphire brooch -- clear evidence you
have found her killer.
180378: The blue jewel on the silver chain pales next to the wearer's natural
beauty.
180445: You don't want Sarah to get the wrong impression.
180539: The years haven't tarnished the sapphire crystal.
180576: The inlaid sapphire crystal is perfectly shaped.
180617: "Please Charlie -- not in public."
180658: Between you and Sarah, you've eaten every last bit.
180702: The plates are empty.
180726: You shouldn't really put stuff on the plates.
180764: You don't find any hidden bonuses.
180815: The wine bottle is half full.
180846: It would be more respectable to do that from a glass.
180890: The waiter has already done that for you.
180936: How disgusting -- you should be ashamed.
180976: This isn't the place for idiotic foolishness.
181016: Ruining Sarah's evening dress could well end your relationship.
181068: That simply wouldn't be amusing.
181107: That's an awkward thing to do while you're holding the glass. Best put
it down -- you don't want to ruin your evening.
181202: Saint MartinnYour pour a decent quantity of wine into the glass.
Proposing a toast to future happiness, you offer the glass to Sarah. The
annoying waiter makes another unwanted intrusion, essentially snatching the
wine bottle and glass straight from your hands.

"Forgive me sir. We have some
special customers who have been waiting longer -- you know how it is."

He
gives you a feigned look of sympathy, shrugging his shoulders as if that simple
action is enough to excuse his rudeness. You are ready to explode in rage when
Sarah lays a pacifying hand on your face. Her voice is captivating; you can't
take your eyes off her sapphire brooch, glittering on its silver chain.

"Don't
get involved in arguments -- that's not the reason we came here. Besides, I
much prefer wine of the red variety. Let's cap off our romantic dinner with a
much better substitute -- hmm?"

Sarah parts her lips, waiting for your
response.
181849: You'd just make a mess.
181874: The wine was uncorked on arrival.
181909: You must specify where you want to pour the wine.
182179: "Let me do that, Charlie."
182222: apm
Sarah picks up the fortune cookie, crushing it between her
varnished fingernails. Joyfully giggling, she unfolds the message inside.
Originally looking bewildered and then unmistakably frightened, Sarah puts your
mind at ease with a reassuring smile. You ask her what's wrong. The reply is a
single word which still echoes in your memory.

"Nothing....."
182531: What could be taking her so long? She's been in the toilet for over ten
minutes now.
182599: You'd better go and find out what's happened to Sarah -- not that she's
missing a cinematic classic.
182687: The smell of tobacco lingers from a previous showing.
182731: Your attention is rapidly wading.
182770: You may as well give Sarah another couple of minutes.
182873: There's no loose change to be found.
182907: Mindless violence belongs in action movies.
182969: The film doesn't have that much depth to it.
183002: Cinema screens are supposed to be looked at.
183066: For some obscure reason, these people are actually enjoying the movie.
It wouldn't be the done thing to disturb their idea of entertainment.
183191: You're not leaving until the film is over.
183223: Saint MartinnThe film hasn't finished. It may be a load of rubbish, but
it cost four pounds to get inside and you hate wasting money.
183338: You don't want more junk to carry around.
183374: That might land you in big trouble.
183439: The male toilets door isn't open.
183471: No -- the people inside might mistake you for a pervert.
183521: Uncharted territory, but you might have to risk it.
183558: Like all doors, it looks worse from behind.
183628: You don't want to just go blundering in.
183659: In one of your bravest acts, you open the door and enter the forbidden
zone.
183743: The door is closed.
183764: Saint MartinnIf anybody is inside, they don't reply.
183809: You're still reeling in shock.
183837: Finding no sign of Sarah, you leave to search elsewhere.
183902: You can't take your eyes off Sarah.
183951: You'd rather not.
183977: The innocent student is gone. In his place is a mentally shattered
shell.
184030: You see a bright student looking back on the happiest night of his
life.
184094: Your rage is still under control.
184119: You don't need bad luck.
184185: You don't need a wash.
184209: None of the taps is turned on.
184240: The sinks are immovable.
184278: A previous visitor has left a nail file in one of the sinks.
184342: The cubicle door is wooden, painted a grotesque light green. The lock
is in the
184423: Only one of the toilet cubicles is engaged. The rest are vacant.
184472: Sarah's body is in the open cubicle, brutally strangled.
184553: It's bad enough having to look at Sarah from here.
184600: You can see inside from where you're standing.
184635: Strange -- there doesn't seem to be anyone inside.
184684: Sarah's strangled body dominates your view.
184717: Toilet doors are designed to be private.
184753: There's nothing to get a grip on.
184795: The space at the bottom of the door is too small to crawl under.
184850: Closing the door won't change tonight's events -- they'll stay with you
forever.
184948: The door is too well constructed to pry open.
185025: The occupant is dead.
185042: Whoever's on the toilet doesn't respond.
185090: Your efforts don't even move the door.
185150: You're not that strong.
185185: You wish you'd never touched the lock in the first place.
185247: The lock is only supposed to be opened from inside the cubicle.
185300: It's already locked -- that's the problem.
185350: The lock won't break that easily.
185380: The lock is part of the toilet cubicle door.
185439: You don't have anything handy to do such a thing with.
185614: axn position. The door opening is an event you will relive in countless
nightmares. You try to convince yourself it isn't happening, but the sight
before you is too brutally realistic to dismiss as a fantasy. A woman enters
the room, but you never see her face. Her screams as she runs off to fetch help
fail to register -- your brain seized up the moment you saw Sarah's corpse.

In
an instant, thousands of television shows lose their impact. News of murders
that take place in the city every day suddenly seem very close to home. Sarah's
body rests limply in the toilet seat, her legs bent upwards. Her dress is cut
open and her bra torn aside, but they alone can't even begin to tell the story.
Around her neck a silk tie has been mercilessly tightened, pulling her forever
beyond your reach.

She never got a chance to say "I love you."
186241: Particles of nail varnish have stuck to the file.
186281: The nail file is sturdily constructed.
186314: Nothing has changed since you last looked -- all your wishing won't
bring her back.
186382: Next to her body is a familiar piece of screwed up paper.
186533: Sarah's eyes show no movement.
186583: Sarah's sapphire brooch is gone.
186608: Touching her body would only incriminate you -- it's too late to do
anything for Sarah now.
186687: Mtlia CxnYou need to be holding the paper to do that.
186728: You unfold the paper, confirming your hunch. It's from the fortune
cookie, a message written especially with Sarah in mind.
186839: You'd better unscrew it first.
186884: Nothing obvious happens.
186911: The choking odour of chlorine.
187012: All you hear is the psychotic commentary. The tarpaulin is completely
soundproofed.
187071: Eerie silence.
187104: You can't simply stand watching.
187146: There's a control panel on the south wall.
187191: She wasn't waving, but drowning.
187224: She isn't waving, but drowning.
187314: Something seems to be happening.
187355: The corridor leading to the gymnasium is dark -- hunting ground for
psychos.
187410: You cautiously edge your way along the corridor, taking time to ensure
all the adjoining doors are locked. Eventually you come to the sports centre's
large gymnasium.
187573: Metallic scraping comes from the entrance, now several metres behind
you. The steel shutters have closed -- no turning back now.
187677: Underwater lights on the swimming pool's tiled walls simultaneously
switch on. Powerful beams illuminate particles of grit and crumbling mortar
suspended motionless in the watery depths.
187819: There is movement under the water -- something is rising up from the
bottom. An outsretched fist punches in vain against the underside of the
plastic. The psycho's voice booms out over the sports centre public address
system.

"Experiencing deja vu, Charlie Boy? This isn't the first time you've
been foiled in your scheme to bag a rich girlfriend. You're nothing more than a
scam artist, an empty hulk of wasted potential. Tonight you've proved what I
knew all along. You have the intelligence, yet you use it to help corporate
bankers get a little richer -- as if they really need the money."
188243: Joannapm
Joanna is swimming furiously, pointing a finger southwards
towards the wall behind you. 

"I was trying to help you by taking Sarah out of
the equation, make you realise your mistakes, put you on the path to greatness.
Yet you just spit it straight back in my face -- how unusual. You go through it
all again: the lies, the pretence that you love her -- you even ask her out to
the same cinema where your previous girl was brutally raped and murdered. Was
the memory of Sarah so easy to erase? Or perhaps it never got to you that much
in the first place. Don't pretend you actually
188662: about Joanna. It's not in your nature to love anybody for the person
they are inside. What were you planning to ask her on the honeymoon -- the
combination to her safe?"
188788: Joanna presses her face against the tarpaulin, searching frantically
for pockets of trapped air.

"What does it feel like, Charlie? Watching her
struggle, unable to do a thing about it -- a helpless spectator. Now you know
how the rest of us felt at Saint Martins. How many times were you asked for
help there, and how many times did you say yes?"
189042: The bubbles of carbon dioxide coming from Joanna's mouth are becoming
more frequent. She tears at the unyielding tarpaulin with long fingernails.
Time, and her crucial supply of oxygen, are running out.

"
189197: -- and even then you insisted on compensation. You never admitted your
guilt did you? No, that would be simply too honourable wouldn't it? Instead,
you just let somebody who actually had guts be the fall guy for your slip up.
But then, poor Colin was just a means to the end, a source of income -- you had
what you wanted.
189442: Joanna dives down to the bottom of the pool, streamlining her arms to
make one last attempt to break through the barrier.

"Just how much do they pay
you at that accountancy firm? Do you get a bonus for ripping off your clients?
I bet you even use their fancy computer database to check out potential wives,
don't you?"
189675: Saint Martinn
Joanna's efforts are muffled by water resistance, her
attack feeble. She looks straight at you, crying out in unheard agony. Having
used up all her energy, she has none left to continue her struggle. Gravity
takes over, dragging her still form down into the murky deep.

"Say goodbye to
your dear Joanna. I wouldn't be too concerned with her demise -- there are
plenty of other women out there gullible enough to believe you actually give a
damn."
190002: Saint Martinm
The underwater lamps slowly fade. The water, having
claimed the life of your girlfriend, returns to a state of darkness. Neon strip
lights flicker into life along the gymnasium corridor, softly
humming.

"There's another surprise waiting for you in the next room, Charlie.
And this time, it's something you're going to
190263: The ventilation shafts are blocked up.
190307: Forget it. There's no way to reach the air vents.
190359: You can't get up there.
190391: The dark sunscreens don't let light through in either direction.
190449: The skylights are directly above the swimming pool.
190502: First you have to get up there.
190532: It wouldn't do any good.
190551: There's nothing you can do from down here.
190608: The surface area of the swimming pools measures eight metres by fifty.
Small waves bash gently against the tiled walls.
190718: Your shadow is reflected on the turbulent surface.
190763: You can't -- the tarpaulin's in the way.
190817: How?
190846: You can't do that with the tarpaulin sheet in the way.
190904: Joanna's body has disappeared beneath the water.
190963: That's impossible with the cover in place.
191015: You don't have the strength to pull the tarpaulin away by hand.
191110: Attempting to pry up the tarpaulin is futile. There's just too much of
it.
191172: The tarpaulin resists all your efforts to pierce it open.
191218: The polythene is smooth and slippery after being wiped clean.
191266: The plastic has been cleaned recently.
191367: The tarpaulin buckles slightly under your weight, but holds firm.
191458: You can't see a thing -- the corridor is pitch black.
191499: Neon lamps flicker along the corridor.
191542: Many buttons, switches and knobs, all of them unlabelled.
191618: The control panel has been put out of order.
191651: Wrecking the panel would be a bad move.
191686: Saint MartinnThe indicator lamp is dark; someone has deliberately cut
off the power.
191751: Without any power, the control panel is just a useless mass of
switches.
191803: Saint MartinnThe only responses you get are squeaking knobs and
clicking switches, then you notice the indicator lamp is dark -- no power.
191902: There are no access panels in sight.
191943: The underwater lights have been switched off, confining Joanna to a
dark grave.
192000: There are approximately fifty lights along each of the pool's longer
sides.
192071: The lights make Joanna's plight terrifyingly clear.
192110: You see nothing but dust particles.
192151: Joanna has been stripped naked.
192221: Joanna is more interested in saving her life.
192269: Joanna can't hear you.
192311: He's there right in front of you, on the wooden horse -- Tony, one
person you hoped never to see again. The heavy chains haven't affected the fear
factor, and the muffle on his mouth doesn't make him appear any less docile.
192470: Tony hasn't moved since you last looked -- he's still chained to the
wooden horse.
192578: You are distracted by the sound of high pitched whistling. A crossbow
bolt blurs past you, thudding into the wooden horse. Tony, centimetres away
from the point of impact, flinches back and glances upwards. You follow his
gaze, taking in the situation: enemy standing on the gantry, loaded crossbow in
hand, laser sight centred on your head.
192844: "This time there's no easy option, Charlie Boy."
192890: It's hard to keep your eyes fixed on the horse when Tony's lying on
top.
192950: A barbed crossbow has ripped apart the cloth, burying itself deep into
the wood.
193033: The horse is too heavy, especially with somebody so heavily built
chained on top.
193097: Not with your mortal enemy on top.
193139: The wooden horse is scant protection.
193171: The chains wrap right around the wooden horse.
193221: There's no room on top of the wooden horse.
193272: "No, Charlie -- you're supposed to stick it in what's on top of the
horse."
193377: For the first time you can remember, Tony is genuinely frightened.
193426: Tony still has that look of inborn hatred.
193470: Tony looks increasingly worried at the turn of events.
193509: Tony doesn't show any reaction.
193539: Tony is chained up.
193568: Tony's voice is muffled -- you can't hear a word he says.
193623: You aren't well versed in knife throwing.
193654: You see no need to torture Tony, despite what he did at Saint Martins.
193712: That's not something you want to do.
193757: The psycho has dressed Tony in the Saint Martins college uniform,
complete with brown leather shoes.
193895: You've chosen better weapons.
193918: Nervously, you walk over to the wooden horse. Tony closes his eyes as
you prepare to deliver the fatal blow. Thinking it will make things easier, you
think back to your first day: getting the ball for Joanna, the iron railing,
your blood mixing in the rainwater.

Joining Tony in his eyes shut vigil, you
plunge the knife into his stomach. Except it never connects -- the blade has
retreated inwards. Needles concealed inside the handle spring out, digging deep
into your right hand. Stumbling, you drop the hunting knife on the ground.
There isn't a single drop of blood on the blade -- it's all on the handle. And
it's your blood, not Tony's.

The clown masked figure tumbles from the gantry,
breaking apart on the floor. Sticking out of the straw filled cloth bags is a
tape recorder.
194479: ymgeaxm A black leather boot crushes the microphone concealed in the
discarded muffler. Confused, you look towards Tony. The chains have broken
apart -- and he's gone.

"You never were the bravest, were you Charlie
Boy?"

The voice is Tony's -- the voice of a psychopath.
194748: You'd rather not touch Tony.
194839: The chains are held firmly in place.
194932: The chain ends have been welded together -- there is no lock.
194984: The chains are too thick to cut through.
195018: That won't work here.
195067: "This is no place for sympathy, Charlie."
195162: Your enemy looks down on you from a high gantry, one eye peering
through the telescopic sight of a loaded crossbow.
195255: You can't see any way to get up there.
195291: It's well out of throwing range.
195321: Standing on top of the catwalk is a familiar figure in a clown mask,
pointing a loaded crossbow straight at you.
195408: Slight problem: it's about fifteen metres above you.
195512: Apart from the wooden horse, there isn't a single piece of gym
equipment in sight -- nowhere to hide. If your enemy chose to pull the trigger,
there would be no escape from the fatal shot.

"Well, are you going to thank
me, Charlie Boy? It's not every day you get the chance for revenge given you on
a plate. That's how you get most things isn't it, Charlie? Spoon fed."
195797: "Let me ask you a question. You think solving those noddy two bit
puzzles I set makes you my equal? It makes you clever, sure. But do you know
what real strength is, Charlie? It's looking someone right in the eye and
slitting their throat from ear to ear, then sensing the fear as you lick the
blood off the blade. We both know it wouldn't be a problem for me, but how
about you? Could you kill your mortal enemy if your own life depended on it?
Shall we find out?"

The clown masked figure picks up a hunting knife from the
gantry, tosses it into the air, and expertly throws it into the ground between
your feet. The bone carved handle quivers as it strikes home, the equivalent of
a knight's unspoken challenge.
196305: "I didn't expect so much hesitation. After all, who is Tony Vincents
compared to Charles Johnson? You're the man with all the certificates, and he's
just a coward who liked preying on the weak. Look at him, Charlie Boy -- he's
nobody.
196521: what he did to you? Every time you walked through those doors you were
looking over your shoulder. From your very first day at Saint Martins, he made
your life sheer hell. I remember seeing the blood on your face -- you saying it
was nothing, a fall on the street. That was just the beginning -- every minute
of the day you were praying for the end. Now's your opportunity to do just that
-- end it, make him pay for what he did. All it takes is a little conviction.
Think about it.
196880: "Let me put this extremely simply. One of you must die. Him or you --
which will it be?"

Your enemy's grip on the crossbow tightens. Thinking you're
ready to concede, Tony shakes his head in an attempt to dissaude you.
197048: "I'm beginning to think you're not good enough. You've got ten seconds
to prove me wrong."
197122: "Ten ... nine ... eight ..."
197156: "... seven ... six ... five ..."
197194: "... four ... three ... two ..."
197254: "That's right, Charlie Boy. Have you got the taste of victory in your
mouth now?"
197335: The clown masked figure is holding a loaded crossbow -- aimed at you.
197386: Your enemy's vantage point is inaccessible.
197434: Enemies with loaded crossbows aren't usually in the mood for a pleasant
chat.
197496: The psycho is well in control.
197524: You couldn't hit a target a metre away.
197558: You're too far away.
197634: From down here?
197652: The enemy's supposed to be the psychopath, not you.
197758: Your enemy's the one with the crossbow.
197802: The crossbow bolt is wedged in so far you can't move it.
197909: No amount of force will move the bolt.
197953: The hunting knife slots perfectly into the psycho's belt.
198001: The hunting knife is easily within reach of Joanna's gloved hand. You
get the feeling you're a lover destined for the blade.
198090: The handle is carved from animal bone, depicting images of hawks, lions
and sharks -- fearless predators.
198178: "I'm very disappointed in you, Charlie Boy."
198231: The knife's blade is razor sharp.
198275: The knife gleams in the morning light.
198304: The reflection of a man with a terrible dilemma.
198344: Your throwing accuracy is terrible.
198383: The psycho wants you to do more than point it -- indeed, much more.
198439: Your knife is no match for the crossbow.
198479: mger, The bolt strikes you with such force it cracks your skull wide
open. Blood clouds your vision as the gymnasium floor moves up to meet your
falling body. You never feel the impact.
198607: mlia ThmJoy overtakes you. You're in an ambulance, safe. No -- it's
just an ordinary van, and you're still the prisoner of a psychopath.
198714: The rear of the vehicle is cluttered with equipment, most of it on a
metal workbench to the side. One way windows provide views of an outside world
oblivious to your plight. The driver's side is separated from yours by a steel
grille.
198915: Tony's voice seems unnaturally close.

"I've been looking forward to
our reunion for some time. Do you remember what I said to you on the final day
in the locker room?"
199050: mgerhn. Back then it was just compensation for our trouble. This time I
want more, Charlie -- catch my drift?"
199138: The trolley jerks as the van rolls over bumpy terrain, the neck strap
becoming chokingly tight. Fortunately everything settles down before any
serious damage is done. Strange -- the psycho didn't offer any verbal reaction.
199396: Wailing sirens give you a glimmer of hope. The van pulls over to allow
the police car to pass unhindered. Blue flashing lights fade into the distance.
199508: Changes in sound and pitch black windows tell you the van is inside a
tunnel. Moments later, it comes back out onto the country lane.
199608: The trolley moves to one side as the van turns a sharp bend.
199658: The van is slowing down.
199689: The psycho brings the van to a halt, switching off the engine. The only
noise comes from animals in the surrounding woodland. The front door slams
shut. You hear footsteps in the snow outside.
199834: The rear doors are swung outwards -- there's no sign of the psychopath
yet.
199894: Blows are exchanged in an unseen struggle -- the thud of metal against
bone, followed by strangled gasping, and then silence.
199996: Tony struggles into view, hand clutched around his throat in a hopeless
attempt to stop the flow of blood. He takes one last despairing look at you,
eager for redemption.

"Forgive me, Charlie?"

He doesn't live to hear your
reply. Tony topples over, white snow turning dark pink.
200224: The clown masked psychopath enters the frame of the door, wiping the
hunting knife clean of Tony's blood. After sliding the blade inside a leather
belt, the killer turns to look at you.
200373: Your confused expression at recent revelations rubs off on your captor.
It doesn't make any sense --
200503: "You're smarter than I thought, Charlie Boy -- but you still don't know
the half of it."
200577: "You just can't figure this one out, can you? I thought no problem was
beyond you, Charlie. You were the brilliant student to whom everything was a
simple brain teaser, yet you have absolutely no idea who I am -- do you?"

The
psycho's voice has changed, isn't so deep. Instead it now carries a mind
wrenching ring of familiarity.

No -- it can't be. There has to be a loophole,
a mistake in your reasoning.
200903: Anaesthetic.
200936: The sound of birds chirping in forest trees drifts in through the open
doors.
200991: Tony's voice is slightly distorted.
201069: Everything is normal: windscreen, dashboard, passenger and driver
seats, rear view mirror. Nobody would suspect the person driving to be a
psychopath.
201190: The rear doors of the van have the same darkened windows as the side
panelling. All of the locks are on the outside -- it figures.
201300: Dawn is approaching over the distant horizon. The van has stopped in
the middle of a forest, a tall dam structure barely visible in the morning
mists.
201405: The van leaves twin trails of molten slush behind on a nameless country
lane.
201471: You see snow covered trees -- no civilization in sight.
201529: bounces off the window. Your gamble didn't pay off -- it remains
intact.
201607: You're not in control of the trolley.
201654: Thin spikes have been welded to the trolley's surface.
201700: Your body's taking up all the room.
201732: You can't crane your neck enough to see under the trolley.
201812: You're going nowhere while you're still strapped in.
201862: The straps hold you in place.
201896: The spikes are sharp enough to cause pain, but too blunt to cut
anything with.
202199: The aluminium bars sound hollow.
202236: One of the screws on the outside of the left handlebar seems loose.
202311: The handlebars seem firm enough.
202442: You place the philips screw back into the hole with only a little
difficulty.
202560: There's nothing unordinary about the philips screw.
202614: There's a ringed washer near the cross shaped tip of the screw.
202659: The screw feels pretty much the same as you would expect.
202702: Saint Martintlia BxnYou're not holding the philips screw.
202805: The philips screw is already in place.
203008: You pull the loose screw off the side of the left handlebar.
203105: The washer won't fit over the screw head.
203141: You slide the washer onto the screw.
203182: A philips screw has been placed through the hole.
203217: There's nothing inside the washer.
203269: You pull the washer out from underneath the copper bracelet.
203328: You can't pull the washer past the screw head.
203366: You remove the washer from the philips screw.
203499: You're not holding the washer.
203573: Underneath the workbench is an oxygen tank.
203623: Some tools have wiped clean, others still carry crimson red traces of
use.
203710: There are no batteries -- the stereo is powered by a portable
generator.
203818: It's an oxygen tank with breathing apparatus, the kind used by scuba
divers.
203903: The dial indicates the tank to be nearly empty.
203954: You've been strapped into an operating trolley, the bonds allowing
little room for movement.
204031: The leather straps are part of the trolley setup.
204079: The leather straps refuse to yield.
204111: The psycho hasn't made escape that easy.
204147: Just you.
204161: There's too much blood.
204230: The straps are already tied -- around you.
204268: The blood on the straps is still sticky.
204432: The rear view mirror is tilted slightly to one side, a pair of fluffy
dice spinning on the support.
204518: You see only the driver's seat -- it's unoccupied.
204557: A hideous clown mask stares back at you from the silvered glass.
204610: The passenger seat has been reclined backwards.
204711: Right in the middle of nowhere.
204745: The instrument panel is dark.
204771: Occasionally the psycho's gloved hand comes into view, reacting quickly
to the adverse weather conditions. The speedometer shows
204924: You see an electronic device on top of the dashboard.
204970: Electronic circuitry linked to a microphone....
205034: The clown masked psychopath stands over Tony, the latest in a long line
of victims.
205095: Tony's corpse lies unaided in the snow outside.
205143: Tony is still wearing the Saint Martins uniform.
205186: Tony's spirit has departed.
205231: The psycho's eyes, distorted behind thin wire mesh, don't even blink.
205328: Restricted by your position, your aim is false.
205460: You're not the one in control here.
205556: The psycho isn't here to engage in conversation.
205601: Joanna's dead -- you watched her drown, remember?
205647: It can't be Joanna -- the voice on the telephone was far too deep.
205696: You can't be sure it's her.
205819: Stunned by your voiced challenge, your enemy immediately puts one hand
on the hunting knife. The standoff lasts for ten seconds. Eventually the
psycho's stance becomes more relaxed, gloved fists unclenching. Gracefully, the
leather-clad figure walks over, removing the clown mask.

Every instinct
screams at you not to look, to avoid confirmation of the shattering truth --
but you know it's her before she takes off the hood. Everything she said, the
accusations she made, all fit neatly into place.

Joanna tosses the clown mask
aside, exposing something equally hideous -- the enemy you never wanted
revealed.
206285: The psycho tears away the clown mask. You look upon the face of someone
you thought you knew -- someone whom you trusted with your life. All trace of
disguise has gone; the voice is unmistakable. 

"You always were so gullible.
You think Tony would be clever enough to orchestrate all this? You put him on
the same level as me?"

The straps holding you in place leave you powerless to
act. Your enemy walks gloatinging over to your twitching body, loving affection
replaced by insane psychosis.

"How does it make you feel, Charlie Boy? To know
you're going to occupy the same dirt hole as
206714: ."

The psycho grabs a tuft of your hair, yanking your head backwards.
Cold steel bites into your throat. In the blade's reflection you see your
enemy's smile of triumph.

"Do you think they'll even bother to look for your
bodies? It's not like anybody misses accountants and street punks -- it'd just
be a waste of time, effort,
206959: . Ironic, isn't it? The one thing you care about will keep your corpse
rotting in the ground, chewed to bits by earthworms."

Your enemy leaves the
sickening prospect to be your last thought. Not for the first or last time, the
operating trolley is soaked in human blood.
207169: The black cloth turns your speech into a series of groans.
207226: "What was that, Charlie?"
207254: "You'll have to speak up -- I can't hear you."
207298: "You shouldn't talk with your mouth full."
207336: "What did you say, darling?"
207359: Listening to her is enough to have to bear.
207397: Somehow, you think she's of the dominant species.
207441: The only thing she's interested in is turning you into a corpse. It's
just a question of time.
207515: Your opinion of Joanna has changed drastically.
207555: Thick leather straps prevent you from doing so.
207651: You doubt she actually cares.
207690: Your girlfriend turned enemy is standing much too close for comfort.
207771: She bends over to whisper in your ear.

"It just occured to me that we
never got round to the intimacy part of our relationship. You've shown yourself
to a very observant young man. Who knows? Maybe you'll turn out to be good
enough. Do you want a chance to prove it, Charlie Boy?"
207986: "You wouldn't be the first to try -- your other lover girl did her
best. She kept on wailing, asking me why I wanted to see her body. Don't get
the wrong impression of me -- I only did it to throw the police off the scent.
Apparently, they arrested some poor serial rapist who took the flak for
everything. I have to admit, though: she was nice company."

Joanna continues
her psychological barrage, unbuttoning her leather jacket. She reaches into her
undershirt, pulling out a polished sapphire on a silver chain: Sarah's
brooch.

"Your eyes give you away, Charlie -- still the modern day treasure
hunter. Ah well, we can't all be perfect."
208460: euapn
Joanna puts the brooch away and refastens her jacket. From
underneath the trolley she pulls a black cloth bag tied with string -- no doubt
another of her sinister torture devices. After wrapping it around your head,
she tightens the fastening cord, effectively blindfolding you.
208681: The noise is coming from somewhere up ahead. Movement from the trolley
startles you -- it's being pushed towards the exit. You feel the wheels go over
a bump, accompanied by the squishing of soggy mud. From its location relative
to the van, the "bump" was probably Tony.
208886: The terrain is becoming rougher. You can sense the moisture in the
daybreak air, the chill of the swirling mists biting into your fingers. Rodents
dash about in the woodlands around you, scattering frosted leaves. Joanna's
voice is soft, echoing.

"I'm not sure why you deserve better than any of the
others who misused their talents. You've met them, haven't you?"
209228: Natalie -- the saleswoman dying for customers to take up 'insurance
coverplans', just so she could bump up her commision.
209315: Violet -- a factory manager with her fancy little time sheets, sweating
every ounce of work from her employees in order to meet her oh so precious
profit quota.
209428: And then there was Amber -- the sports agent who lived off other
people's success because she failed in her own miserable attempt at
life."

"Are you beginning to see a pattern form here, Charlie Boy?"
209580: The trolley ceases movement. Joanna's mood becomes even more
unbalanced.

"
209655: "Well, can you see it or not?"
209721: What you presume to be a weather worn gate opens on its squeaky hinges.
The gradient increases; you're being pushed uphill. It's stopped snowing. No --
you can still hear hailstone battering the bushes. You must be under shelter.
209891: The ground has evened out again.
209920: ymgf:nUnderground machinery bursts into life. Joanna has to shout for
you to hear her over the noise.

"I bet you're wondering what the copper
bracelet does. Why don't you ask Rose when you see her? She was another one --
a mercenary pleasure seeker who was anybody's girl for a price. I just couldn't
stand living with such a loser. Why bother to go out looking for these scum,
when there's an unsuspecting little brat sharing your apartment?"
210242: "You know what strikes me as amusing? The lengths people go to when you
promise to let them live."
210316: ohn
"Shall I let you in on something, lover boy? After all, engaged
couples aren't supposed to have secrets."
210474: Your prayers are answered, the washer bending the needle out of harm's
way. You feel venom dribbling down your left hand. Joanna is so caught up in
her ranting that she fails to notice. You feign complete paralysis, hoping to
buy some valuable time.
210655: Saint MartinmPain spreads up your left arm, followed by complete
paralysis. Your body is a frozen exhibition of suffering.
210734: "Your precious Sarah was a fraud -- she was bankrupt, Charlie. She lied
just to get you in her bed."

Joanna loosens the straps on the trolley,
twisting your arms behind your back in well rehearsed fashion.
210976: as two circlets of steel are snapped around your ankles. The weighted
chain linking them together pulls downwards with such force that your kneebones
creak with tension.

A single push is enough to knock you from the trolley.
There's no ground on the other side to break your fall.....
211199: The clown mask has been discarded.
211226: The blindfold is a small sack of black material.
211268: A tough nylon cord is sewn on the back.
211326: The blindfold is fastened from behind with tough nylon cord.
211401: Now free of the sight constraint, you allow yourself a split second to
take in the surroundings.
211518: Your head's taking up all the room.
211545: That's a pretty pointless suggestion.
211600: There's no cord to cut -- you've already snipped it.
211685: Not after it took so much effort to get it off.
211727: You can't reach the blindfold.
211772: You can't see a thing for the blindfold on your head.
211825: The blindfold is in the way of your mouth.
211873: Little light penetrates the black cloth. For the moment, you'll have to
rely on your other senses.
212032: The string is on the back of the blindfold, more than a metre from your
bound hands.
212107: The cord has been tied into knots which would be too complicated to
undo -- even if you could see them.
212255: The string is tied into a knot at the rear of the blindfold.
212377: After slicing away with the improvised tool, the string comes loose and
floats off into the water.
212477: Silence is deadly.
212503: Machinery is in operation. The only thing you can tell for sure is that
it's located underground.
212572: Frozen twigs crack underneath the trolley's wheels.
212614: Something burned out here recently.
212699: "That's too bad -- I'd hoped someone of your calibre would appreciate
the finer details."
212809: c,"You should do, because you're part of it -- the greatest screw up of
them all."
212877: Joanna moves so swiftly you don't hear the knife come out of the
sheath. She's done it so many times before that slitting someone's throat has
become a routine exercise in killing.
213015: You don't have to worry about the leg irons anymore.
213120: The leg irons have been locked in place.
213195: You're trying to unlock them!
213228: The leg irons are firmly fastened.
213279: Even underwater, the lead weight is much too heavy to lift.
213327: The two metal rings around your ankles link up to a dense lead sphere.
213396: Attempting to break open the leg irons is futile.
213498: Sheer desperation wins through: the clamps click open. Free of your
bonds, you push yourself off the bottom.
213588: There is no air left, a severe bump on the head telling you the water
tank is full.
213663: The freezing cold water clouds your vision.
213711: In case you hadn't noticed, you're swimming in it.
213784: The freezing water is all around you.
213823: Some of the water has frozen over, chunks of ice floating on top.
213878: The water is unpleasant enough to look at, let alone taste.
213938: The liquid runs through your fingers.
213970: Sanitation problems are the least of your worries.
214165: That's a natural reaction.
214240: The supply of air you have left is vital -- it won't last forever.
214300: Swirling liquid fills your ears.
214325: The sound of rushing water is deafeningly loud in such a claustrophobic
space.
214421: The water smells stagnant.
214517: Even stretching the leg iron chain to its limit, the water still
reaches up to your neck.
214592: Saint Martinm
The water level rises above your head.
214669: The air gap between the water and the tank ceiling is now less than a
metre wide.
214738: Saint Martinm
The water level has risen to the top of the tank,
submerging you.
214800: The pressure buildup behind the blindfold shoots it away from the inlet
pipe -- it soon vanishes from sight.
214895: Underneath mounting pressure from its surroundings, the chunk of ice
crumbles to useless pieces which melt away.
215027: You emerge from underneath the water, gasping for air.
215239: Your resistance finally crumbles, mouth opening wide in resignation. As
your lungs fill with freezing water, you think back to when you graduated --
and the choices you could have made.
215496: The rooftop trapdoor is bolted shut from outside, polarised light
coming in through parallel cracks in the woodwork.
215582: Rushing air presses the blindfold suffocatingly against your face. You
splash down into a waist deep pool of water, the weight around your legs
pulling them below the icy surface.
215717: Saint MartinmThe venom has started to spread. Too dizzy to remain
standing, you topple over, water closing in over you.
215805: You lose your grip on what you're carrying.
215842: You mimic the venom's effect, faking total inability to move.
215896: Unfortunately, that means losing your grip on what you're carrying.
216009: There's no way out.
216049: You're as far up as you can go.
216185: Sarah 5nYou swim around blindly.
216214: The venom has left you completely paralysed.
216273: Joanna calls down from above.

"Why don't you see for yourself?"
216328: ymgfkhn

"You could always give it back to Sarah, but since she's
actually a pauper, you wouldn't want anything to do with her -- would
you?"

Wood slams against concrete. Joanna rattles closed metal bolts, checking
your tomb is sealed. Satisfied with your predicament, she strides off
whistling. As the unrecognisable tune she is humming becomes quieter, it is
drowned out -- literally -- by noise which carries a far greater implicit
threat. The water around you starts to rotate, rising fast.
216754: You dig around in the water, but find no sign of the brooch.
216800: Your flailing hand comes into contact with a chain -- you've found
Sarah's sapphire brooch.
216898: If you're going to die, you should at the very least allow Sarah a
little dignity.
216996: The inlaid sapphire is wet, linked flimsily to a silver chain.
217085: The illusion of perfection is broken, the brooch coming apart in your
hands. Eluding your grasp, the silver chain is lost, leaving you with only the
brooch pin and of course, the precious sapphire.
217454: The more you look at it, the less perfect the sapphire seems.
217500: Saint MartinnNow looking at it in brighter light, the flaws soon become
apparent: the blue surface isn't quite as polished as it should be, and you
think you see bubbles locked in the crystal.
217627: The sapphire has been torn off its chain, but still looks fabulous in
its silver setting.
217755: The sapphire has been flawlessly cut from raw material.
217808: Even nearing death, you can't lose your grip on such a beautiful work
of art.
217886: The sapphire refuses to crack under your weight -- perhaps it is real
after all.
217949: The sapphire remains in one piece, giving you newfound hope that it's
genuine.
218022: Unfortunately, the pin is more of a blunt rod.
218108: The brooch pin isn't the sharpest you've felt.
218186: How much ice do you need?
218210: The chunk of ice you grab cuts into your hand.
218250: The chunk of ice you push floats away from you, but there's still
plenty around.
218312: Breaking ice into little pieces won't get you out of the water tank.
218366: The floating ice is opaque white in colour.
218402: Equally freezing water.
218426: The ice is loose.
218449: You're not here to sample ice cube delicacies!
218551: Some of the ice must have only formed recently. The edges are very thin
-- and sharp.
218624: The ice comes apart in your hands, what little remains melting almost
straight away.
218688: Drops of moisture cling to the surface.
218929: The screw is too tightly placed to remove by hand.
218982: The brooch pin is too slippery to get a good grip on the screw.
219126: corner. It sinks out of sight towards the bottom of the tank.
219222: As you remove the final pivot, the grating comes away from the opening
in the east wall.
219322: There isn't much of a gap behind the screw.
219362: Banging on the screw won't force it loose.
219416: The drainage grating has fallen away, allowing unrestricted access to
the tunnel beyond.
219488: The drainage grating is reasonably secure.
219524: The drainage grating looks a little more insecure now you have taken
out three of its screws.
219589: The drainage grating has been swung to one side. Only
219735: All of the screws have been removed from the drainage grating.
219938: All of the screws have been removed.
219986: You must specify which screw.
220035: You've already pulled the grating aside.
220075: The grating is too securely fixed to pull aside.
220122: The grating comes off the drainage tunnel, rapidly sinking.
220230: Things must surely improve on the current situation.
220277: The drainage grating isn't in an opened position.
220323: The grating has sunk to the bottom of the tank.
220358: The grating returns to its former position the moment you let go.
220412: You have no intention of blocking up your only exit.
220459: Your path is blocked by a wire grating.
220510: You're not thin enough to get around the grating.
220642: Saint Martinm The water starts to overflow just as you enter the
drainage tunnel.
220711: Thick heavy bolts have been locked into place -- no way out here.
220766: The bolts are on the wrong side.
220799: It's closed already.
220823: It's no good -- the planks are too thick.
220887: Snow covers the surface of the trapdoor, hiding it from any potential
rescuer's view.
220955: The cracks are just about thick enough to let light through.
221010: The cloth bag has stifled the water flow, but it still trickles in fast
enough to keep your air supply estimate at less than a minute.
221113: The blindfold has blocked some of the intake pipe, but the enormous
water pressure is too high for it to stop the flow completely.
221211: It's difficult to tell whether any water's still coming in.
221254: Water floods out of the intake pipe. At this rate, it will only be
seconds before the tank is full.
221349: You wish it were that simple.
221379: The inlet pipe is very much open.
221411: You want less water -- not more.
221441: You can't simply break off the water flow.
221493: The water inlet isn't something you can move.
221540: The blindfold's doing a fine job where it is.
221588: You've done all you can do block the pipe.
221672: You jam the cloth bag inside the inlet pipe, doing enough to slow down
the water flow -- but not stop it completely.
221763: You must be joking.
221793: You're at the mercy of the current.
221820: The drainage tunnel runs from east to west.
221866: Before you can change your mind about rashly swimming towards the water
pumps, the strong current leaves you with no choice.
222035: Miraculously, you pass underneath all three pumps without harm. If the
immense pressure keeps on increasing, you're certain your body will implode.
The metaphorical light at the end of the tunnel comes into sight, the lower
rungs of a ladder dipping into the water.
222260: The pressure jets are strengthening the current.
222300: How can you take a hole?
222326: In effect, they're just holes.
222358: The flow of water is too fast. Nothing would remain in these holes very
long.
222420: Wherever the controls for the pressure jets are, it's not the middle of
a drainage tunnel.
222492: Every single one of the jets is turned on.
222535: There are three pumps, each moving at a different speed to the other
two.
222623: SECOND PUMP:
222695: THIRD PUMP:
222919: It's not that simple.
222941: The pumps are definitely moving.
222982: You could easily lose a hand.
223279: You don't even manage to get past the first pump.
223324: The first pump floats harmlessly behind you, then you come to the
second.
223385: Passing the first two pumps, you have freedom in sight.
223434: Crushed underneath the falling pump, you never feel the water enter
your lungs.
223499: The collision knocks the breath out of you -- never a good thing when
you're underwater.
223603: Praying for deliverance, you grab hold of the ladder. All you can think
of is to climb, climb, climb....
223694: For some reason you avoid your only chance of salvation.
223735: You ignore the glaringly obvious instinct to grab the ladder and let it
pass you by.
223857: The pressure abruptly ends -- you're in the open. For three seconds you
hover in the sky, looking down on a scenic, ice laden forest. You're brought
back down to earth on the walls of a concrete dam.
224002: After a minute's climb, you come to a deserted corridor.
224119: The forces of nature seem unpeturbed by human made destruction.
224175: The last look depressed you so much you don't want to look again.
224223: Saint MartinnThe perfection begins to crumble when you look in detail:
brown water runs through the ice, dead wood nestles amongst the trees. Worst of
all is the structure you're inside -- a half kilometre high hydroelectric dam.
There's been an explosion at some point in the past, turning the so called
green power source into an eyesore.
224493: You never know where it might come in handy.
224532: It's all just scenery.
224559: It feels as good as new.
224600: Not while you're standing on it.
224625: You shouldn't play with ladders.
224685: The rungs are too round in shape to hold anything.
224767: The paint can't be rubbed off.
224795: An ocean would dry if it were left this long.
224841: The paint is too thin to conceal anything.
224886: It's just dry paint.
224955: It would have been a good idea, had you gotten here five minutes
earlier.
225015: It's too late.
225033: You're not in control.
225052: It's too late to do anything about the camera now.
225099: cibfpn
It's not just paranoia: you are being watched. The electronic
eye attached to the ceiling follows you around, its exaggerated movements
suggesting the controller can't believe the transmission. Your last advantage
has just been taken from you -- she knows you're here.
225329: The service lift isn't on this level.
225391: The runners squeak as the lift doors open.
225455: It might come in handy later on.
225549: It probably won't be much longer before the lift -- and Joanna --
arrive on this level.
225689: Grinding from behind the lift doors tells you, in a non too subtle
fashion, to get a move on.
225761: The approaching lift sounds much closer now.
225877: The lift arrives on the sixth floor, bringing with it a sense of
inevitable doom.
225939: The lift doors are shoved to one side.
225968: Your black clad enemy decides to offer one last comment.
226179: Joanna doesn't wait for your response. At this range, the trigger is a
certain death switch. Your view of the crossbow being raised is blocked out by
red laser beams burning cells of your left retina. The severe pain ends when
the barbed projectile passes through your brain.
226431: The security gate in the south wall has been opened.
226470: Much of the wall on this side of the gate has been snowed in overnight
-- it must be a metre deep in some places.
226576: Your enemy is standing on the other side of the security gate.
226626: Joanna has moved out of sight temporarily.
226732: Sarah ihn
Joanna is directing the flame from her welding torch onto the
security gate.
226801: The security gate won't hold out much longer.
226841: Joanna has thrown aside the welding torch and helmet; she stands
outside, preparing for the inevitable coming confrontation.
227009: The security gate rolls partially to one side, allowing access to the
generator room.
227121: Before you can get through, the security gate rolls back into a locked
position.
227198: Steel bars crossed over by high voltage wires and fitted with a
combination lock: the type of gate you'd expect to find in a bank vault. As if
it were needed, there's also a warning sign.
227345: The security gate is closed. Hopefully its official description isn't
inaccurate, and it will afford you some protection in the coming onslaught.
227467: The sign isn't in view.
227516: You already know what's on the other side.
227547: The room beyond the security gate is full of hydroelectric generators.
227610: You can't do that from here.
227633: The locks are controlled from the diamond shaped panel.
227677: With all the security measures, forcing the gate to do your bidding is
clearly a pointless course of action.
227762: The high voltage wires effectively prevent that.
227829: No space to crawl through.
227855: Nothing you have will damage the gate in any way.
227898: Blatantly ignoring the warning, you reach out and touch the gate. As an
alternative to what Joanna has in store, your death is painless -- but still
unnecessary.
228014: Saint MartinnMaybe you should read the warning sign before you go
poking around.
228890: A diamond shaped panel sporting four similarly shaped buttons, one in
each corner.
228954: You've pried off the front of the panel, exposing the gears that make
up the locking mechanism.
229030: The power cable underneath has been yanked out of its socket.
229119: The front of the panel has already been pried off.
229156: You'll need something to pry the panel off with.
229237: There's no keyhole on the outside of the panel -- just the four
buttons.
229369: The front of the panel is closed.
229403: You put the panel back into place.
229452: The power cable has been pulled loose.
229481: There's a power cable linked to the diamond shaped panel.
229552: You must specify which button to push.
229586: The panel feels exactly as you would expect it to.
229666: You'll need something less bulky to pry open the panel.
229725: Using the washer, you force open the diamond shaped panel. Inside are
the workings of the internal locking mechanism: three interlocked cogs and a
keyhole edged in quartz.
229888: Saint MartinmThere are three interlocking cogs inside the panel, each
with a perpendicular scratch on its circumference. Another much larger,
vertical scratch has been made above the cogs.
230058: The cogs can't be moved by hand.
230088: The cogs are part of the machinery; they can't be removed.
230165: You can't move the cogs using force.
230209: The metal is cold.
230293: The keyhole is empty.
230402: The surface of the quartz is rough.
230437: The keyhole is part of the locking mechanism.
230536: You can't see any screws on the keyhole.
230575: You don't have the key.
230599: That's a very silly suggestion.
230758: . The scratch on the inner cog is
230860: . The scratch on the outer cog is
230960: . The scratch on the central cog is
231035: . The one on the central cog is
231519: The cable supplies power to the security gate's locking mechanism.
231566: The power has been disconnected.
231614: The power has been disconnected.
231647: Showers of sparks come from the cable as you pull it from the socket.
The lock is now electrically dead.
231738: You haven't yet pulled the plug.
231763: It would take an engineer to get it back in -- and you're an
accountant.
231883: You shouldn't touch live wires.
231908: The cable wobbles when you touch it.
231943: The wheels supporting the cables are moving -- you can expect company.
231994: The cables are attached to winching wheels further up the shaft.
232058: The cables haven't started moving yet.
232087: The service lift is getting closer.
232119: The service lift is several floors below.
232163: Even if you could jump the distance, there's so much oil on the cables
you'd never make ten metres.
232234: The cables are in the centre of the lift shaft, impossible to reach
from where you're standing.
232319: You don't even have a fraction of the time it would take to move all
this rubble.
232383: The rusted support bars make scaling the rubble too dangerous. In any
case, you'd be an unprotected target up there.
232473: The concrete rubble is too tightly packed.
232509: No hiding space here.
232541: The concrete has settled -- it'll take more strength than you have to
move it.
232610: The snow is too obvious to be any use as a hiding place.
232668: Snowballs won't make an effective weapon.
232729: The sour taste of frozen rainwater.
232761: Some of the snow falls away from the rest of the heap.
232810: You move aside some more snow, but find nothing else.
232863: Underneath the snow you find a cubical slot embedded in the ground.
Cleaning out the compressed ice from inside the tarnished steel, you see it's
empty.
232985: You can't see much of the generators from here.
233033: There's nothing useful on the generators.
233071: The turbines are too large spaced out to be a good hiding spot.
233137: It took the might of natural forces to move these turbines.
233180: You may as well look somewhere else: the generators are lifeless hulks.
233234: The depression is precisely cubical, measuring two centimetres across.
233292: A cranking handle has been placed in the hole.
233325: Apart from a few traces of ice, the hole is empty.
233395: It's a hole -- you can't take it with you.
233460: The ice has made the steel walls cold.
233496: There's nothing to open or close on the hole.
233536: Definitely somewhere you can't hide.
233590: There's something in the hole already.
233661: The cranking handle fits snugly in the cubical depression.
233722: You remove the cranking handle.
233795: It is the single most significant crack you have ever heard. Fragments
of blue glass spray out from under the fallen cabinet, daring you to
contemplate their existence and everything it implies. Sarah deceived you about
her estate -- she
233985: Just bits of wood.
234007: It's hopeless trying to hide there.
234048: Every piece is either too bulky or small to be of any use.
234142: at a working television screen. It bounces off the glass and drops
speedily back to earth.
234224: You know Joanna's coming -- you don't need to see her.
234267: The television screens won't help you.
234305: Everything useful was taken out long ago.
234351: The control panels are defunct.
234379: The panels aren't big enough to get inside.
234417: Somebody beat you to it.
234442: You're wasting valuable time.
234471: The tools cabinet has been left behind, propped up by a rusty wrench.
234522: The tool cabinet lies on its side, door facing upwards.
234575: Lost most stuff around here, the tools cabinet is in pretty bad shape.
A rusty wrench is all that keeps it from toppling over.
234664: The tools cabinet has fallen on its side.
234703: The hinge springs are kaput; the door just swings back open again.
234757: It's a pathetic hiding place -- you'd soon be discovered.
234807: The lock has broken off.
234847: There's nowhere on the cabinet to get a grip.
234880: The wrench is a surprisingly resiliant support -- the cabinet stays
vertical.
234945: It's hopeless trying to get the door back on its feet.
234995: The space is too narrow to make anything out.
235052: Apart from the wrench, you don't see anything.
235138: The mliyou :nThere's no gap at all now.
235167: Nice try, but you're a lot larger than most rodents.
235313: Although the wrench appears loose, all attempts to dislodge it meet
without success.
235387: The vice is rusted shut.
235564: One swipe of the cranking handle is enough to knock the wrench out of
place. As it clatters underneath the cabinet, there is a groan as the tools
cupboard makes a long overdue collapse onto its side.
235742: You've turned the crank as far as it will go, and it won't turn the
other way.
235809: It takes all your effort to move the cranking handle. Becoming easier
to turn as you progress, the gate is sliding smoothly closed by the time you've
finished.
236107: It's just a gap.
236149: Throwing fragments of glass around is extremely dangerous.
236208: The glass fragments are fairly sharp and crunchy.
236253: Some of the glass crunches underfoot.
236314: You edge your way around the wooden crates.
236381: Joanna has been impaled on the crane attachment. She twitches her body,
trying to force herself off the metal bar. With her last breath, she offers her
final observation.

"You're nothing, Charlie. You went through all that
bullying at Saint Martins, and emerged no better for it. You could have been
the king, but you never grasped your opportunities. Now you're just a pawn -- a
dull grey, forgotten pawn. When you look back in ten, twenty years time, you'll
realise I'm right."

Joanna falls silent. You walk over to check her pulse,
stopping when you see a flash of gold from her left wrist. Rolling up the
sleeve of her leather jacket, you mumble a few choice curses. 

Close up, you
can tell the bracelet's just plain old simple brass.
236935: You come out from behind the crates to run straight into Joanna. She
slits your throat with her first swing of the hunting knife.
237066: "Scared already, Charlie Boy?"
237103: Crouching down only makes you an easier target for Joanna's knife
attack.
237174: Joanna would anticipate that move if you made it a second time.
237261: They're too far away.
237284: The steel running tracks are inaccessible.
237322: Attached to the winching crane is a fork lift style attachment, two
parallel bars pointing west fixed to busted up hydraulics. The driving gears
look less than functional, but it might just work. The crane is
237481: There's no way to get up the crane; it's too steep.
237562: The bars on the crane are empty.
237602: The crane is too heavy to move by yourself.
237638: The winching crane might turn out to be your last hope.
237724: It's too late -- she's already here.
237846: You sprinkle the blue glass fragments underneath the crane.
237903: The crates are stacked vertically, but there might be a way round the
side.
237964: The crates are held in place by ropes.
237998: That would rob you of your only potential hiding place.
238044: Spare machine parts are the last thing you need.
238140: There's nothing under any of the pallets.
238216: The wire gets caught slightly as the unit passes over the top of the
crates.
238351: The cable connected to the black box has been severed in two, rendering
it useless.
238412: A remote control unit hangs from the ceiling on a length of cable.
238478: The only feature of the black box, other than its connecting cable, is
a touch sensitive joystick.
238564: The remote control is useless now.
238592: You take the remote control unit in your hands.
238646: You can't find any panels to open.
238685: Joanna has done that for you.
238735: Breaking the unit might be a very bad idea considering your situation.
238809: The joystick only moves in compass directions.
238853: The joystick won't move in that direction.
238921: You hear the crane moving about in the supply room.
239011: You must specify a direction.
239039: Turning the joystick has no effect.
239086: The joystick is easy enough to move by hand.
239139: The cranking handle isn't quite long enough.
239221: You manage to knock the control unit loose with the katana. With
grateful mercy, it falls straight into your open hands.
239348: You can't move about freely while you're holding the remote control.
239407: The remote control's cable won't fit around the crates.
239468: The cable is too short to fit around the crates.
239539: You need to be holding the unit to do that.
239607: Saint Martinm
Joanna obviously perceives the crane as a threat. She
leaps forward, neatly slicing the control unit's cable in two.
239704: The disconnected black box slides from your hands.
240231: You have enough problems.
240326: The blue glass crunches under Joanna's feet -- she must be standing
right in front of the crates.
240426: The remote control unit hangs tantalisingly out of reach.
240490: They could well fall on top of you.
240522: The crates are no easier to climb on this side.
240562: You're not that tiny.
240612: You don't find anything.
240636: There's no writing on the rear side of the crates.
240791: Joanna's challenge rings out like a claustrophobic thunderclap.
240840: "This is it, Charlie Boy: the moment of truth. You want to avenge
Sarah's death, don't you? I took away everything she had: her innocence, her
dignity, her sense of security -- even her virginity. The question is -- how
does that make
241021: feel? Are you ready to fight for what you believe in instead of
settling for the easy option?"

"That's all accountancy is: a way out for the
undecided, a money spinner. This time you're going to have to earn your life,
Charlie -- do you think you're up to it? Tony wasn't much of a challenge -- do
you remember him? Now it's just you and me, one on one: the ultimate test."
241301: Joanna calls out from beyond the security gate, face pressed up against
the bars. She reaches inside her jacket, pulling out something small and shiny.
Unfolding her hand, she reveals her trump card: the lock override key.
241472: Her ability to bypass the combination switches drastically shortens
your odds of survival.
241568: Her anger at being outsmarted turns to amusement; she rises to the
challenge.

"Okay, Charlie Boy -- I'll play your little game."
241758: Your enemy comes back into view, holding her welding torch. She gives
you a wave with her gloved hand.

"Be right with you, Charlie."
241926: Joanna fine tunes the gas control until the flame is an acutely
focused, white hot tongue.
241996: Your enemy directs the welding torch at the security gate, sparks
flying off  the heated steel.
242070: Parts of the security gate are beginning to melt under the intense
heat.
242128: Joanna has almost finished cutting.
242156: yhn
The gas flow stops. Joanna removes the helmet, tossing her
equipment aside. She runs her leathered hand through her greasy hair,
masterfully building up the tension.
242291: The security gate is kicked open, Joanna's leather boots providing
insulation from the lethal electric currents.
242377: You hear the clang of metal on concrete. Joanna has passed her final
obstacle.
242496: Joanna is on the other side of the security gate.
242553: Joanna doesn't seem too interested in conversation.
242595: The bonds between you are too great to heal by love.
242639: Joanna is protected by the security gate.
242677: Trying to appease Joanna is a hopeless gesture.
242814: Joanna is carrying a Japanese style katana, a deadly weapon in her
hands.
242874: Joanna grips the bone carved hunting knife tightly in one hand.
242919: You've disarmed her -- at least for the moment.
242996: Joanna advances towards you, katana in hand.
243036: Joanna stands directly in front of you, katana held against your neck.
243097: Joanna grips the hunting knife, waiting for an opening to appear before
she slices you open.
243171: Joanna stands in front of you, clutching her blood covered hand.
243251: Joanna has cut off your escape.
243286: That's the direction Joanna's coming from.
243346: Joanna has you cornered -- you're going to have to fight her.
243458: "You can't even hold it properly."
243492: "You're not going to bribe your way out of this one, Charlie Boy."
243550: "Very pretty dear. They might make a nice leaving present."
243602: "Careful you don't hurt yourself now."
243640: "What was it like finding out Sarah used you?"
243675: Joanna ignores your gesture.
243844: Joanna swings the sword round in an upwards cleaving arc.
243896: Joanna's first reaction is outrage, but this soon fades when she sees
the sadistic pleasure of beating a better equipped opponent. She unsheaths the
hunting knife from her belt and tosses you her katana. It's ebony hilt slips
clumsily into your right hand.

Joanna adopts a battle stance, crouching
forward in anticipation.

"You think you can take me? Just you try, Charlie
Boy."
244172: Joanna stalks you with the stealthiness of a cat, juggling the hunting
knife between her hands.
244242: Joannahn
"You can't win, Charlie. You simply don't understand what you
signed away that first day at Hanningers. When you think about it, what do you
really have? Your fellow workers are there for the cash payments, just like
you. Keith's a sleazeball -- the only reason he hired me was to try out his non
existent sex appeal. I even took away Tony -- now you won't have nightmares
anymore. All that's left is me, the only person who sees the real Charles
Johnson instead of a faceless accountant. Eliminate that from the frame, and
you have nothing."

Her brutal statement strikes a mental chord. It's only a
flash from her right wrist which attracts your attention to her flexing
fingers. Joanna's eyes focus on your right hand, the one holding the katana.
244786: Joanna's palm opens up. A wire cord loops over the top of the katana,
its steel noose tightening around the lower blade.
244880: Joanna pulls the other end, sending the sword spinning across the
floor.
244939: There is a horrible grinding of steel on steel, the wire cord slipping
open along the steel daggers. Joanna pulls it back, smiling despite being
thwarted again. She chews something in her mouth; something shiny glints
between her teeth.
245111: Her mouth opens again, the dart fired from the tiny blowpipe burying
itself between your eyes. The katana is becoming heavier, but you never hear it
land on the ground. A pretty in woman in pink takes a silver lute in her hands,
swinging it to and fro. Strange -- that's not how you play a lute....
245333: The mouth dart she intended to fire into you misses by little more than
a hair's width. Joanna grinds her teeth in anger, foaming at the mouth.
245435: uhn
Joanna is down to her last line of defence. She grips the hunting
knife so tightly her knuckles turn white. Her frustration is starting to tell.
245556: Joanna pulls the hunting knife steadily backwards, bending her arm in
readiness.
245678: Your enemy turns the knife over in her hands.
245775: Metal locks against metal as the deadly battle of strengths begins.
Joanna twists the knife, aiming a punch at your face to give her the edge she
desperately needs. Accidentally, your hand presses against the serpent. Daggers
rip through Joanna's leather gloves, but she doesn't seem to feel the
pain.

"Remember what I said?
246014: ."

Ignoring her thinly veiled threat, you keep up the pressure. The
hunting knife, covered in Joanna's blood, slides gratingly across the floor.
Joanna backs away, clutching at her hand.
246186: You get round the crates just in time to see a shuriken fly into the
wood. Joanna recovers just as you turn the corner.
246283: Joanna pulls off her glove, but you don't see the concealed weapon
until its too late. The shuriken flies into your chest, the same venom you
experienced in her apartment reentering your blood system. She scoops to pick
up the katana. Not too impressed by your unexpected resilience, she makes your
death a very slow, agonising one. Slicing off selected fingers and hands, she
makes you watch the dismembered body parts twitch before finally ending it all
with a blow to your neck.
246748: Joanna backs you up against the crates, a predator moving in for the
kill. She presses the point of her katana against your neck.

"You look so
clueless, Charlie. Even with the advantage of a better weapon, you'd still
manage to screw it up. That's your job description, Charlie -- professional
disaster. I was at the very least expecting a bit of a challenge, but I'm
afraid I don't have the million pound payoff it takes to get someone like you
interested."

Joanna tenses her muscles, preparing to deliver the killer blow.
247126: Evifkkmskdxn
Joanna pursues you with frightening conviction.
247180: Joanna takes advantage of your hesitation to close the gap, thrusting
out with her katana. The blade passes neatly between your ribs, an effortless
twist of her hand causing you exscrutiating pain. Blowing you a kiss, she
dispatches you from the sword with a well placed kick. Your gloating enemy
encircles your blood splattered body. The attack has left you so shattered you
never see the death blow coming.
247479: There won't be a happy ending here.
247518: Joanna quite literally cuts you off in mid speech.
247599: Joanna has already given you the katana.
247637: Joanna has only one thing you want -- the katana.
247674: Joanna has done you one favour -- asking for more will only invite
death.
247749: Joanna doesn't want to hear your bedtime stories.
247810: You can't negotiate with her.
247851: You'll need everything you can lay yours hands on.
247903: Joanna doesn't even seem to notice the fragments, keeping her eyes
fixed on you.
248030: Joanna meets your attack with the edge of her sword.
248078: You never make it -- she has yet another trick up her sleeve.
248133: The brooch pin isn't much of a match for the weapon she has.
248186: Unbelievably, Joanna manages to twist out of the way. The only damage
done by the thrusting blade is tear open her leather jacket. She spins the
hunting knife, swings it back, and buries it into your left eye socket.
248346: The cranking handle is a clumsy weapon, hardly any match for her knife.
248492: Joanna has already given you a weapon.
248627: It might be worth trying when she gets more reckless.
248690: The katana's blade flashes in Joanna's hand.
248725: Glancing at the hilt, you see one serpent in particular stands out.
248797: It's too clumsy to use as a throwing weapon.
248840: To throw Joanna's katana down would probably upset her -- not the
advised course of action with a psychopath.
248932: The blade looks sharp.
248949: One of the serpents feels loose.
248996: You swing the katana, a pathetic attempt to distract your nemesis.
249050: Joanna's holding the katana -- not you.
249114: The blood covered hunting knife has been dropped onto the floor.
249169: You're sure she's fixed the knife so that it won't retract.
249214: You've managed to knock the knife from Joanna's hand.
249309: You've already knocked it from her hands.
249410: Your weak effort to knock away Joanna's weapon is both obvious and
stupidly lowers your defences. With her extra experience, the return attack
doesn't suffer those shortfalls.
249560: The hunting knife is part of Joanna's arsenal, not yours.
249603: Joanna's the one with the hunting knife.
249650: You can't see the handle -- Joanna's gloved hand is clasped firmly
round it.
249833: You press the serpent, and again the daggers emerge from the lower end
of the blade.
249897: Squeezing the serpent causes four tiny daggers to sprout from the lower
end of the blade.
249969: Saint Martinn
The tiny daggers retreat back inside almost immediately.
250018: The shuriken still sticks out from the crates, black poison on its
blades a grim reminder of your struggle.
250138: Joanna strides purposefully into the room. Pulling a Japanese samurai
sword from a sheath tied to her back, she swipes it in flowing arced movements
to show off her expert fencing skills. Neglecting even the customary
psychological insults, she goes straight on the offensive. The finer details of
your planned death are made obvious from the way she juicily weighs up your
neck, only a moderately difficult target for someone with her ability.
250453: Joanna's voice rings out mockingly from beyond the crates.

"You always
fancied yourself as quite the mathematician didn't you, Charlie? So tell me
this: if a stack of crates measuring oh say, five metres high was supported by
three ropes, how many would I have to cut through for the whole thing to
collapse?"

Air is parted by a slashing blade, the snapped ropes coiling up on
the supply room floor. The crates wobble, then the weight of hundreds of spare
machine parts come crashing down on your head.
250821: In one stroke, the razor sharp katana passes through your neck. The
agonising content of such a quick death is woefully underestimated.
250922: Diverting your attention from Joanna was a bad mistake.
250971: When you hear the sword swiping through the air, it's already too late.
251034: The hunting knife slices open your stomach, sending you tumbling
backwards into the crates. Joanna gives you a powerful kick in the groin,
making you wince in pain. She has the upper hand, taunting you by slashing at
sensitive parts of your face. Finally losing her patience, she picks up the
fallen sword, arching her arms to swing it with devastating force.
251295: You hear the crane moving about in the supply room, followed by
psychotic laughter.

"Is that the best you can do, Charlie Boy?"
251390: You hear the crane moving about, followed by silence.
251759: Good question.
251782: There are a lot of strange people around.
251818: Surely you've figured that out by now.
251865: A slimy toad you have for a boss.
251890: Who?
251911: Someone you're thinking of marrying.
251943: Someone even nicer than Sarah.
251976: Someone you're finding more and more attractive -- though she can't
match Sarah's assets.
252048: Someone you thought you knew.
252076: Who?
252134: You've never seen her before.
252157: You don't have a girlfriend.
252202: You don't want to think about what happened that night.
252248: Who?
252258: Someone you're starting to take a liking to -- all her jewellery is
quite special to behold.
252330: The most beautiful woman you've ever met.
252535: You have no idea.
252555: Someone who's asking you to cheat.
252582: The incident seems so vague, forgotten.
252628: You haven't met him yet.
252657: You never actually met the headmaster.
252686: You still haven't met the headmaster.
252732: You've only been here a day.
252755: A miserable place.
252800: You'd rather not know.
252819: Someone who took long glances at you in Chemistry class.
252867: Painful memories still give you nightmares.
252898: Someone you wish you had never met.
252943: Who?
253031: You haven't got a clue.
253050: A sheep shagger from Yorkshire who's very fond of sunshine.
253111: She was the form tutor you met earlier today.
253144: She taught French in your first year at Saint Martins. Nobody could
ever sort out her bizarre accent.
253239: Who's that?
253250: Mister Wrigley has two passions: Mozart and snakes.
253311: Someone told you his physical education is nasty stuff.
253357: At least there's no more football practice to endure.
253396: For some reason, his whistle scares you: the call to dreaded football
practice.
253495: It's the same as last time: just that annoying answering machine.
253542: It would be easier to check the apartment yourself.
253580: Saint MartinnYou dial the number for Joanna's apartment. After a few
rings, the answering machine cuts in automatically. You leave a message for her
to get back to you and then terminate the call.
253741: You don't need a taxi.
253760: You're already at Joanna's apartment.
253808: You're halfway through making the call when it happens.
253858: There's absolutely no reason to do that.
253894: It's probably just some crank caller. You could get fined for wasting
police time.
253958: You've phoned the police already -- and it didn't do much good.
254011: Saint MartinnCalling the police, you get put through an automated
switchboard. After being on hold for a half a minute, you disconnect the call,
seeing no need to run up your phone bill for a few wrecked picture frames.

It will forever remain one of life's mysteries: why should a
simple man like yourself get on the wrong side of anybody? 

You are, after
all, just a typical accountant. A little sideline romance with the secretary
(what's she called -- Joanna) is a pleasant diversion from the tedium of your
nine hour working day. Even your name, Charles Johnson, is
unremarkable.

Unfortunately, in today's world, security is nothing more than
an illusion. Predators, sometimes even our most trusted friends, make plans for
our downfall. Unseen snipers close in, ready to pull the trigger when we least
expect it.

Perhaps it's just human nature -- everybody has....
257386: . This makes you
257404: Hnan average nobody.
257424: Xna man of little merit.
257514: Xna slight underachiever.
257743: You never were any good at singing.
257830: That's difficult to do while you're wearing it.
258072: That would be nothing more than a waste of energy.
258317: You don't have a telephone handy.
258352: Joanna's telephone has been disconnected.
258388: Your enemy won't let you near the phone.
258419: You have your own telephone to rely on, so why use Joanna's?
258469: You can't dial out while the telephone is ringing.
258511: At the moment, you're receiving an incoming call.
258695: Eh?
258743: That might not be a good idea.
258766: There is no reply.
258798: That isn't going to work.
258834: What?
258962: Uh?
259071: Nothing noticable happens.
259098: Not right now.
259114: There's not much point.
259145: There's no question to answer.
259173: You agree with yourself.
259228: For some reason, you see fit to disagree with yourself.
259290: Doing that won't help you.
259388: You'll have to figure that out for yourself.
259484: You don't know the telephone number.
259547: You don't have a phone, but Charlie's right here if you need to talk to
him.
259639: You're not using a telephone.
259674: This isn't Saint Bride's -- and there's no secret.
259722: Magic doesn't work in the real world.
259785: That won't help you.
259858: That's not an option here.
260029: You've written everything you need to.
260089: There's no telephone to use.
260131: Joanna's telephone is broken.
260164: Eh?
260192: It might be best if you specified who you wanted to call, as opposed to
their number.
260268: There's no telephone available for use.
260297: So, who ya gonna call?
260322: My, aren't we feeling hygenic?
260720: You can't go that way.
260848: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
260880: As good-looking as ever.
260936: Where is she?
260952: There's nothing that way other than the library, and you never cared
much for reading.
261018: Bang!
261056: One of the city's newest attractions. Personally you detest these many
screen multiplexes, preferring old style cinemas complete with ice cream
service. Through the glass doors a ticket office and popcorn stand are visible.
You look away, determined not to give in to the temptation.
261256: Large red letters on a white board prominently display the latest movie
attractions. You happen to notice the christmas blockbuster is still playing,
having already made twenty million since its release in the UK.
261432: An essential piece of office machinery, the portable phone provides the
usual features and assorted optional extras. The only ones of interest to you
are the answer, cutoff and redial buttons.
261592: Joanna!
261632: It hadn't escaped your attention that Joanna lives in one of the
smarter parts of the city, with surprisingly clean streets and a notable lack
of youth gangs. Hedges line the paved stone walls which border her apartment
building, evenly spaced with decorative oriental-style lanterns.
261832: The apartment building is to the north.
261864: If you ever needed confirmation you were right in your estimation of
Joanna's wealth, surely this provides it. The lanterns are of such high quality
they could have been imported directly from medieval Japan, casting their
yellowish glow over the neighbouring tarmac.
262048: The front door to Joanna's apartment is the centrepiece of the porch,
flanked on either side by moss covered pillars of solid marble.
262144: The only exits are the apartment door and the path leading south.
262208: Sat snugly among a clump of weeds is the garden's only ornament: a foot
high gnome carved from clay.
262280: The gnome's clay base is about eight inches in diameter, with a brass
ring running around the circumference.
262368: The tiny glass window is half an inch in diameter.
262408: Just an ordinary stainless steel Yale key.
262438: The hallway opens up into a fairly spacious apartment with rooms to the
north, east and west. Framed pictures line the wall opposite the entrance,
arranged neatly into rows of five.

One of the frames has been smashed open,
traces of glass having settled onto the plush red carpet.
262648: The apartment only has one floor.
262672: They're photographs of Joanna from when she was a young child through
to the present day, the more recent ones showing you and her together.
Curiously, one of the pictures has been forcibly removed from its brass frame.
You try and recall the contents of the missing photograph, but a combination of
too much wine on your previous visit here, along with bad memory, keep them
from you.
262944: The hexagonal glass table top is held aloft by the arms of its
supporting statue. Not up on your mythology, you have to rely on the markings
to tell you it's a likeness of Hera, the Greek goddess.
263096: It's so dark outside that simply determining the eye's colour is beyond
you.
263152: The black leather clothing worn by the intruder confirm your
suspicions, leaving little doubt it is the motorcyclist you saw earlier. All
that's missing is the crash helmet; instead the enemy now wears a gruesomely
painted clown mask.
263328: Plants in full bloom hang in wicker baskets, a slowly rotating ceiling
fan providing a cool breeze not wholly welcome in the present season. Moonlight
shines in through a skylight somewhere above, giving the whole room quite a
spooky ambience.
263496: The rest of the apartment is to the west.
263528: Laminated fins of plastic cut through the air, clanking against the
wobbling support shaft.
263600: Upon closer inspection, you see some of the flowers have wilted from
lack of attention, rays of moonlight passing through their darkened leaves.
263848: Ivory handled kitchen utensils hang from a mahogany wall rack,
complementing the spotless white counter. Tucked away in the corner is a modern
washing machine, the kind of luxury you hope to obtain as a lifetime goal.
264000: The hallway is back to the south.
264024: It's a modern washer/dryer combo; half the non-essential features
remain unused.
264088: The image of neatness is shattered by one untidy element: a kitchen
knife on the otherwise empty tiled floor.
264168: The reason for the smell is now painfully obvious: a smoking dead rat,
thoroughly roasted through by the high stove setting.
264256: Unable to avert your eyes, you see the poor beast was sadistically
placed in a baking tin. There are still signs of vegetable oil which hasn't yet
evaporated, and scratches where the animal desperately clawed in hope of
escape.
264416: Powerful gas jets are in place at the back end of the stove, bellowing
forth golden flames which turn the interior into what is in effect a furnace.
264520: The dust resistant paper the photograph is printed on is slowly turning
to glowing red ash.
264584: Joanna's bathroom is a cut above the normal standard, with a Jacuzzi in
place of the more common bathtub. All the pipes and fittings are coated in gold
paint, trying their hardest to imitate the real thing.
264728: There's no exit in that direction.
264760: The water in the tub is overflowing, the excess emptying out through
specially designed drainage gratings. A lever, looking more ornamental than
practical, is on a stone pedestal next to the Jacuzzi, together with a
push-button switch.
264928: The taps have been left turned on, steaming hot water pouring into the
Jacuzzi from the main intake pipe. A silk garter, crimson red, bobs up and down
on the surface.
265048: Aside from being painted gold, the taps seem pretty normal.
265096: The lever is a nice addition to the set-up -- a rod of polished golden
steel supported by a fancy pivot.
265184: The blue liquid inside the glass container is pale and easy to see
through.
265240: Applause echoes around the Queen Victoria Hall, but the spotlights are
firmly on you. The college governors are all present for the annual awards
ceremony, and the guest of honour is a former pupil, now a mathematics
professor at Cambridge.
265408: Stairs only lead down from the stage, not up.
265440: Don't you think you'd better collect your certificate before you wander
off?
265496: All the spotlights are on you -- the star of the ceremony.
265544: The funding body for Saint Martins College, all wearing smart academic
attire.
265600: Over a thousand people are gathered inside the hall.
265640: The professor is a middle aged man in his forties, sporting the
stereotypical, well trimmed beard and a rather peculiar set of spectacles.
265736: Your certificate is printed in black writing on official headed college
paper, the crest proudly displayed on the front.
265824: Dark clouds are gathering on the horizon, their obscuring of the sun
resulting in a premature twilight. Tall iron fences mark the boundary of Saint
Martins College, the centre of learning to which you are relatively new. A
single tree stands alone near the gate, flattened mounds of leaves having been
raked up against the trunk.
266056: The college gates are locked, and the fence is an impassable barrier.
266104: There's nothing worth seeing on the other side of the street, except a
couple of run down slums.
266184: NUMBER ONE!
266200: The post the sign is perched on is starting to rot, weeds growing in
the neglected soil.
266280: Leaning against the fence is a sorry sight for the eyes: a young girl,
face invisible behind dry mud and scrappy rags.
266368: Evidently a pupil of the college, the insignia on her blazer being
testament to that, the girl has the appearance of a beggar. Her face and hands
are dirty, the rest of her old uniform has become nothing more than torn pieces
of cloth, and her blonde hair resembles poorly combed straw.
266576: It's just a red ball of soft leather, a child's toy.
266616: Snap!
266624: Leaves, now a dull autumn orange, hang loosely from the branches.
Through the bare sticks of wood, you are able to glance along College road.
Most of the area is terraced housing, many missing rooftop slates completing
the picture of poverty.
266800: There are no more secure branches higher up.
266832: You might easily fall if you tried moving sideways.
266872: Ever since the incident in the canteen earlier today, you have
suspected Tony of being the Saint Martins College bully. One glance at his
shadowy figure, mingling perfectly with the near-darkness of the sky, suggests
you may have underestimated his nastiness.
267056: The only way out is to the east.
267080: The plastic insulation has peeled away; underneath is dangerous copper
wire.
267136: The lamp is so dim you can actually see the softly glowing tungsten
filament inside.
267200: Pieces of broken glass are spread across the storeroom floor.
267248: A thin wire made from tungsten which glows under the influence of an
electric current. It's a common component in most lightbulbs.
267344: The varnish has started to come off the handle, but the maker's label
is still legible.
267424: The bracelet is simple, devoid of any markings or designs. A single
lump of solder has been welded to the clasp on the rear side, sealing it shut.
267560: Urban "artwork" has been spray painted on the walls.
267608: Most of the design area has been thoroughly wrecked. Ripped up wooden
planks and boards have been dumped unceremoniously on the ground.
267704: Thin tracing paper covered in pencil diagrams and assorted text.
267752: The stone steps have been darkened with fallen soot. Young lovers'
initials punctuate the designs of lions engraved on the banister.
267848: You always held the view that pottery was the most useless subject the
college practiced. It seems an even greater waste of space now that the bowls
and statues, often in production for months on end, have collapsed into
hardened clay shards.
268016: The only exit is to the north.
268040: The pride and glory of the potters' union. Without proper artistry,
their measly efforts were never worth anyone's time.
268128: The bulk of the room is taken up by a huge kiln, connected to powerful
extractor fans and a multitude of pipes.
268208: The potters' oven is in better shape than the rest of the room; at
least it's still in one whole piece. Huge extractor fans loom overhead, blocked
up with dense grime.
268328: The pipes intertwine amongst each other many times, becoming impossible
to follow as they reach the ceiling. Two still functional valves are within
reach: one to control the gas and the other for water.
268472: A lever for controlling gas flow to the kiln.
268504: This valve controls the supply of coolant to the kiln's interior.
268560: This is the corridor that runs behind the central hall of Saint
Martins, extending westwards. Overhead, the wooden support beams have all but
rotted through, neglected ever since the college's closure almost three years
ago. The only classrooms whose entrances haven't been boarded up are to the
north and east.
268776: There's no exit in that direction.
268808: After the retirement of "Big Jim", all the neatness associated with
room eight in his heyday abruptly ended. No longer are piles of exercise books
ruthlessly stacked, nor will any more terrified first year pupils cower in his
presence. Having lost most of its furniture to neighbouring institutions, the
classroom now boasts the bare minimum of memoirs: tatty historical posters and
the ever reliable slide projector.
269096: The corridor is to the south.
269136: It's a minor miracle the posters are still attached to the wall.
Evidently considered either too valuable or worthless to remove, they have been
allowed to curl up and fade with the passage of time. In one sense they have
gone full circle, becoming the type of relic they once depicted.
269544: The button is moderately sized, green and rectangular. From watching
Big Jim's oversized fingers operate the projector, you know this is the control
to advance the slides inside.
269704: Schoolhood myth has it this room was purpose built for musical
ensembles. It's where the Mozart-obsessed Mister Wrigley held his compulsory
choir practice. Far too many wires run along the ceiling, connecting up his
near-infamous stereo megasound system; it must have been too complicated to
dismantle.
269920: The corridor is to the west of here.
269952: In each corner of the ceiling is a ridiculously massive speaker -- a
nightclub style setup allowing no freedom within audible range.
270048: Smack!
270056: CHARLIE!
270072: The ink in which the song is written strongly resembles Joanna's
handwriting.
270128: The slanted floor tiles and chunks of decade-old mortar are a difficult
surface to walk on. Archways to the east open up into the college's central
hall. On the west side of the corridor is the lion's den, otherwise known as
the headmaster's study -- bordered on either side by disused notice boards.
270344: The only exits are in the major compass directions.
270384: The notice boards are full of tiny pinholes -- a recent newspaper
article has been stapled onto the cork.
270504: Moonlight enters through the fractured stained glass window in the
roof, filtering down through the rafters. The grandfather clock, built as part
of a memorial to former pupils killed in action during the great war, has long
since ticked its final second.
270680: The only way out of here is west.
270712: It resembles an ordinary piece of wire -- the coils have lost their
tension.
270768: Without the man himself to add his fearful touch, this room retains
only a fragment of its sinister impact. The mahogany desk and matching chair
have stood the test of time well, but the dreaded white cane is gone. Whole
sections of wallpaper have peeled away; the plaster underneath is riddled with
cracks.
270984: The door is east of you.
271008: There are more cracks than you care to count.
271040: From reputation you know the fish are man-eaters.
271080: Electrically fried piranha fish.
271112: It's a standard slot screw made from bronze.
271144: Aside from the sticky patch where the label used to be, nothing strikes
you as odd.
271216: The invoice is dated July 1996, roughly the date when the council shut
down Saint Martins. Official watermarks which you recognise as belonging to
Cheltenhams (the prestigious jewellers) head the notepaper. There are some
items lower down the page.
271400: This room is testament to the old adage that some things never change:
the radiators are as cold now as they were during endless winter months in your
time here, the number of coat pegs is just as woefully inadequate, and the
smell of school dinners still presides in the western portion of the room.
271608: The main exits are to the north and south, with other rooms off to the
sides.
271664: The inlet pipe has seized up with rust. Apparently it never occured to
the staff to get the central heating working, or maybe they were just being
economical.
271776: An old pupil's leather satchel is tucked underneath the wooden shoe
bench.
271832: A cheap leather suitcase -- the kind of bargain buy everyone made when
the headmaster invented a silly rule to make them compulsory college equipment.
The name plate has tarnished with age.
271968: This was supposed to be a student's haven, but a lack of staff presence
made it perfect hunting ground for school bullies. The bottleneck spaces
between lockers were often used as intimidation zones and "education areas" by
Tony and his thugs.
272136: The cloakroom is west of here.
272160: One locker stands out from the rest: a titanium plated beauty with a
high security padlock.
272224: The titanium locker has been opened.
272256: Built with unprecedented security in mind, the titanium door and walls
are half an inch thick. The padlock is same type used on your office safes --
top grade, unopenable without the proper key. There's a round white sticker on
the door.
272424: The first glance was enough.
272448: So disgusting was the cuisine at Saint Martins that the eating area
still reeks of stale bread and burned porridge. Deep scratches are the only
hint that the canteen was once overfilled with communal dining tables.
272600: The kitchens are to the west, the cloakroom to the east.
272640: The removal people wisely chose not to take the refrigerator -- a
disease breeder's paradise.
272712: You'd be shocked if real blackcurrants were used to make it. More
likely it's just a concoction of poorly selected flavourings.
272872: REMEMBER SARAH?
272896: The woman's blood forms tiny interlocking streams along the greased
white plastic.
272960: The woman's corpse has been discarded matter of factly on the cutting
table. Marks on her wrists suggest she was tied up, meticulously sliced open
and left to die. Most of the blood has soaked into her uniform.
273128: The two sides of the door are separated by empty space, a vaccuum
designed to keep cold air in -- or warm out, depending on which way you look at
it.
273232: Icicles grow in stalactite-like clumps on the ceiling, slowly melting
in the steadily rising temperatures. Plastic bags of food have been loaded onto
an out of service conveyor belt. The freezer room extends northwards.
273384: Drops of water are starting to form on the melting ice.
273448: Burn marks covering the victim's face bear all the hallmarks of
systematic torture. Most of the unpleasantness is hidden by the oil splattered
factory overalls the woman is wearing.
273576: Decaying scraps of meat residue cling to aluminium hooks on the
ceiling. It's been so long since the room was cleaned that even in these
sub-zero conditions, the bacteria have started to feed. A large, heavy duty
freezer unit is at the far end of the room.
273760: There's only one way to go from here -- south.
273800: The rotting meat is not a pretty sight.
273832: A powerful commercial freezer, capable of reaching extremely low
temperatures.
273888: It's impossible to tell whether the victim was frozen before or after
her death. The crossbow bolt embedded in her forehead has been snapped near the
barbed tip. Blood from the wound has solidified, her preserved face making the
loss seem all the more tragic. For some reason which will probably never come
to light, the psychopath has jammed the woman's appointment book inside her
open mouth.
274184: Saint Martins' coat of arms hangs from a brass flagpole above the
entrance, a symbol of hereditary vanity. More misplaced prestige can be found
in both the sports centre and the trophy room, to the east and west
respectively. Steps provide access to the laboratory wing housed on the first
floor.
274392: A red dragon against a blue shield background -- an appropiate choice
of predator.
274456: You always compared the doors of Saint Martins to the gates of Hell --
they were the point of no return, Tony and his army of thugs lurking beyond
waiting for their unwilling playmates to arrive. Rivets the size of your fists
secure an iron bar in place across the oak panels.
274648: With sport not on your list of strongest activities, the only time you
visited this room was when the headmaster found it necessary to outline the
crowning achievements of "his" school. Local hooligans have laid waste to the
team photographs, foolishly left hanging out of a sense of pride by the
college's benefactors.
274872: The way out of here is east.
274904: Looking at a bunch of pompous former pupils in cricket gear is a grim
reminder of Wilson's gruelling athletics training. Every time you drive past
baking hot tarmac playing surfaces in your company car, you remember him and
his over-the-top regulations.
275080: Every display case, with one notable exception, has been smashed.
275128: The display case is the type normally found in museums: a twenty
centimetre cube of plastic on a raised pedestal. Security is controlled by an
electronic keypad.
275248: The keypad is the standard interface, containing the digits 0 to 9 on
equally sized touch sensitive buttons.
275328: The main laboratory wing extends to the north, with one smaller room on
the southeast corner. Windows providing a rare view of the outside world from
Saint Martins appear somewhat gratuitous in their elevated position.
275480: Aside from the laboratories, the only way to go from here is down.
275528: Now the natural elements have conspired to deny you even the luxury of
seeing the sky, coating the outside surface in opaque white frost.
275624: In a shoddy attempt to recreate the observatory environment, shamefully
amateurish photographs of stellar bodies have been plastered all over the domed
walls. The telescopes, for a long time the pride and joy of the physics
department, have degenerated into defunct tubes of hollow steel.
275824: The exit is to the northwest.
275848: Even the photos which were taken in focus aren't very interesting. Many
display repetitious star formations, others simply show the vastness of empty
space. The sun and the two inner planets, Mercury and Venus are the subject of
pictures of superior quality; they must have been purchased.
276056: The controls have been ripped out of their sockets, and the heavily
dented tubes are twisted in awkward directions.
276312: Various teaching leftovers have been piled messily into a corner:
battered animal cages, plastic containers, old computer equipment -- somebody
even took the trouble to drag a blackboard all the way up here. Off to the
northeast and northwest are the science labs you were once so fond of.
276656: Aside from a few grey hairs and some overgrown cobwebs, the cages are
empty.
276720: Plastic boxes with about half a metre cubed of storage space, filled to
the brim with exercise books.
276792: A blackboard of the revolving variety, split into sections using metal
seperator rods. The chalk markings were made recently.
276880: The paper is green and white stripes, with rows of punched holes
running down the sides.
276952: The piece of paper is torn along one edge, giving the impression it was
ripped from a lab journal. Holes have been punched along the faint grid,
forming a message.
277072: The first thing that catches your attention is the lab's main
workbench; the second is the wired explosive on top, linked to a whole series
of electronic devices.
277192: The main laboratory wing is to the southwest.
277232: There is a certain ruthless simplicity about the button.
277280: Beep!
277288: A device designed to transfer electric charge between components. There
are two terminals, positive and negative.
277368: The chemical battery is about the size of one of your fingers.
277416: A die shaped capacitor, with tiny writing on one of the faces.
277488: A round capacitor, with tiny writing on the side.
277624: Rays from industrial strength lightbulbs are centrally focused by
polished mirrors. The glare is so strong you are forced to avert your eyes. At
least the equipment cupboards are bare -- glass implements were Tony's
favourite choice of weapon.
277800: The only way out is southeast.
277824: You'll end up blind if you look directly into the light.
277864: Too many bad memories of broken lenses being waved in your face.
277920: The light is directed onto a chandelier type assembly supported by a
network of optical fibres.
277992: Three hemispherical shells are fixed to the outer circuit, one at the
far end and another in each of the bottom corners.
278080: There are three inverted cones on the inner ring, corresponding exactly
with the midpoints of the outer hemispheres.
278392: Steel shutters barricade the entrance to the sports complex. If only
they had been here before you may have been spared Wilson's fuming hot temper.
As the weakest member of the Wednesday afternoon football class, you were made
an example of on numerous occasions.
278576: Apart from the sports centre entrance, the only way to go from here is
west.
278640: Joanna's apartment in Pennyworth Lane is clearly marked.
278688: Almost all the nightclubs are located in one seedy district.
278736: Where it all started for Joanna -- and ended for Sarah.
278784: You could hardly forget the location of Saint Martins.
278824: The majority of shops are in a shopping centre on Kendalls Avenue.
278880: The headquarters of Coopers are in a tall office skyscraper.
278936: Most industries and warehouses are packed into a dense industrial zone.
279000: Even in computer form, the blade looks sharp.
279048: This icon is animated, drips of poison falling off the tip of the
needle.
279120: The nozzle spews forth flaming gas.
279168: String pulled taut around its tail, the loaded crossbow bolt is ready
for firing.
279232: The question mark rotates on its spot.
279280: The Japanese style samurai sword spins about its wooden hilt, sweeping
back and forth in a lethal arc.
279384: Reinforced steel -- an effective method to keep out unwanted intruders.
279440: To see your face, Charlie Boy.
279464: Benches have been cleared aside, rows of examination desks substituted
in their place. There are occasional gaps, a few nervous pupils having bottled
out. The proceedings are being supervised by Big Jim and Smith, fine examples
of teachers with unsettling presences.
279664: You're sure the chairs are part of a conspiracy to keep you awake.
279720: Interfering with other pupils in examinations is prohibited -- and none
of them has any part in the plan.
279800: There's never enough time.
279832: The pen was given to you as a prize for achieving the highest mark in
the college's entry exam -- the first in a long line of honours.
279936: The latest attempt by Saint Martins college to take you down a peg or
two.
279992: Round mints inside a silver wrapper. You just hope it's a good enough
disguise.
280048: The plastic case has snapped open, memory chips and solar panels
spilling onto the floor.
280112: Wu Sang's is definitely worthy of its reputation as the city's finest
dining spot. Everything about the place is beautiful: the relaxing background
music, scenic fish tanks illuminated by strobes, all complemented by a pleasant
wharfside setting.
280296: Rare breeds of fish swim through streams of bubbles, turquoise light
reflecting off the smooth pebbles at the bottom.
280376: You've chosen a quiet table for two in the corner. Sarah sits opposite,
dressed in a dazzling black gown.
280456: Your girlfriend is as beautiful as ever.
280488: The tail end of the chair is carved into dragons from Chinese folklore.
Soft velvet cushions make it far more comfortable than it actually appears.
280592: Only a few inevitable sauce stains upset the intricacy of the
tablecloth designs.
280648: It must be one of the finest menus you have opted for. The spare ribs
alone were worth the price -- well, almost.
280744: Comparitively cheap wine of the sparkling house variety -- at least you
can't argue over the price.
280816: The flawless crystal would even make Saint Martins drinks sparkle.
280864: You think you see glue along the crack of the nutshell -- probably just
your imagination.
280928: The film is mercifully coming to a close. Bringing Sarah to this dull
excuse for a romantic comedy was hardly a masterstroke of judgement. Most
moviegoers have taken the advice of critics and stayed away. Apart from a few
sorry film buffs, the cinema is empty.
281112: The exit from the cinema is to the south.
281144: Coated in horrible red polyester, the seat is the ultimate in mass
furniture discomfort. It comes complete with a smelly ashtray and an extremely
sticky drinks holder.
281264: Like much of the previous hour, what you see is nothing short of utter
trash.
281320: Sad middle aged people, most wearing old fashioned shades.
281368: Glossy posters advertise coming attractions, strategically placed for
maximum audience impact. Toilets are on each side of the corridor leading to
the main exit.
281480: You'd better get Sarah first -- there'd be even less point in wandering
about the cinema than watching the movie.
281560: You don't need to "go" at the moment.
281592: The usual hype surrounding Hollywood studio productions.
281632: The symbol identifies the door to the west as the male toilets.
281680: The coast is clear: not a half dressed woman in sight. Rows of
identical cubicles take up the southern side of the room. Opposite them are the
ever present facilities of public lavatories, depressingly ordinary sinks and
mirrors.
281840: Every sink seems to be made of the same creamy white porcelain.
281904: The lock is made of metal, with a small window for viewing the plastic
indicator dial. It's currently in the red locked position.
282008: The nail file's rough edge has worn down after extensive use.
282056: Clearly the murder weapon.
282088: It looks remarkably similar to the paper from the fortune cookie Sarah
opened up earlier.
282224: Air ventilation shafts are blocked up, allowing no outlet for the
lingering smell of chlorine. Dark sunscreens have been drawn across the rooftop
skylights, shutting out all natural light. A clear sheet of tarpaulin covers
the entirety of the swimming pool.
282408: The steel shutters are down. You'll have to find another way out.
282456: The only apparent exit is the tunnel leading to the gymnasium east of
here.
282528: Isn't that right, Charlie Boy?
282568: Cobweb strands trapped between the shutters dangle vertically,
confirming a total lack of air movement.
282640: Black windows on the roof, arranged in a spiral pattern.
282680: There's enough plastic to cover the entire surface of the pool. You
can't see any chinks in the armour.
282776: Joanna's struggles for survival are becoming weaker.
282816: The exit is to the west.
282840: Crack!
282856: Iron chains bind Tony to the wooden horse.
282888: The muffle covers the lower part of Tony's face, his mouth hidden
behind a metal gauze.
282952: The steel walkway runs around the perimeter of the gymnasium, supported
from above by steel girders.
283064: The enemy is wearing the same gear as back at Joanna's apartment, the
black leather outfit appearing even darker under the gymnasium spotlights. One
finger of a gloved hand rests itchily on the crossbow trigger.
283216: The crossbow is made all the deadlier by the laser sighting attachment.
283272: The crossbow bolt's barbed tip has bitten deep into the wood.
283320: A hunting knife has been thrown in the gymnasium floor.
283360: Twang!
283384: Click. Grind. Clunk.
283402: It's not possible!
283432: The front of the van is kept separate from the rear by a wafer thin
sheet of steel. Tiny holes have been punched at random, allowing glimpses of
the driver's cabin.
283552: The van interior has been deliberately darkened, making it only
possible to see through the windows from this side. The psycho is taking no
chances with nosy passers by.
283680: The trolley was originally designed for emergency operations, but the
removal of the soft cushion and addition of thick leather straps suggest the
psycho has found an entirely different use. The name of the hospital has been
scratched off the handlebars.
283856: Aluminium handlebars are on either side of the trolley.
283896: The washer is roughly the same dimensions as a new ten pence coin, with
a hole in the exact centre.
283968: Somebody has been playing around with a stereo, taking apart the
speakers. Most of the psycho's "tools" are kept in a leather case.
284064: The leather case resembles a filofax whose innards have been torn out.
On the inside are several pockets filled with scalpels and drill heads.
284168: The radio has its back to you, wires stretching from its battery
compartment to a portable generator. The tape recorder has all the usual
buttons.
284280: High voltage electricity generator.
284314: The mouthpiece is still wet....
284352: The leather straps tied around your neck, waist and ankles have blood
on them.
284416: Pink fluffy dice suspended on stained cheese wire, with skulls in place
of spots.
284472: Two people in the van....
284496: The driver's seat isn't in your line of sight.
284536: The windscreen wipers do their utmost to remove the falling sleet, but
visibility is almost down to zero.
284616: A voice modulator.
284632: Tony's throat has been slit with well practiced brutality.
284680: The white face of death.
284720: Joanna's face retains all its beauty, but there is an underlying evil
behind the pleasant exterior.
284790: Click. Whirr.
284824: ANSWER ME!
284838: Creak.
284850: Click. Buzz. Whirr.
284876: Beep. Beep. Beep.
284912: The clown's twisted smile adequately reflects the mind of the mask's
psychotic owner.
284976: The fastening mechanism for the blindfold is a piece of tough nylon.
285024: You have little protection from the cold, overnight temperatures
considerably below freezing. It's still snowing -- you can feel fallen ice
melting on your exposed hands.
285152: There's only impenetratable tank walls in that direction.
285192: Clink, clink. Splash!
285224: Now you can see it, the pin looks far from impressive.
285264: The intake pipes must be cold -- chunks of ice float on top of the
water.
285320: It's more of a nut than a screw, with a wide groove cutting straight
across its hexagonal head.
285424: The way you came in has been bolted shut.
285464: The confined space in the drainage pipe makes the water all the more
turbulent. Matters aren't improved by the pressure jets being switched on at
full blast, feeding even more water into the tunnel.
285600: There's nothing that way except a full water tank and certain death.
285648: Holes have been bored into the concrete at regular intervals, powerful
currents sweeping away the emerging bubbles of trapped oxygen.
285744: As if there needed to be any more complications, the internal water
pumps further down the tunnel duly provide them.
285824: The ladder passes by so quickly you're not sure if it really existed.
285872: Wind brings in the winter chill through smashed up concrete. Gaps in
the wall look out on forestry below, trees split up by frozen rivers. So still
is the picture you could be looking out onto a painted landscape. The ladder
continues on up the shaft.
286048: You're wet enough for one day.
286072: You're two hundred metres above ground level.
286104: The ladder is the only means of movement.
286144: The maintenance workers obviously didn't do their job properly. Plastic
coating on the rungs has hardly been touched.
286232: Calling it that is extremely generous: it can't be more than ten metres
long, and the only means of access from other levels are the ladder and a
service lift. According to the sloppy paintwork you're on the sixth floor.
286384: The shaft is so narrow you'd be a sitting duck if Joanna came looking.
286440: The only ways out are the service lift and the security gate on the
opposite wall.
286504: Both the letter and figure are badly drawn, paint being allowed to run
down the concrete before it dried.
286584: The eye has stopped moving.
286608: It belongs the larger type of lift, used for moving service goods
between floors. The doors are made from corrugated iron.
286738: Click.
286752: Click. Whirr.
286848: The keyhole is edged in pale quartz, with an engraved inscription to
one side.
286928: One whole section of the roof has collapsed inwards, curved support
bars jutting out dangerously from the concrete rubble strewn underneath. The
generators are silent; huge turbines hang over dry reservoirs. To the south and
southeast the light gradually fades.
287112: There's no exit in that direction.
287144: The cause of the collapse is obvious -- now the steel support bars are
exposed, you can clearly see the fractures.
287224: The snow, now in a moderately warmer climate, has softened up slightly.
287280: The generators are as dead as the enclosing concrete.
287320: The whole area resembles the aftermath of a salvage operation. Tables
are overturned, and the banks of monitors which somehow survived the carnage
all have dark screens. Every single control panel has been forcibly ripped
open, its vital components removed.
287512: The workstation arches around to the northwest and southwest.
287560: The smashed up blocks of wood aren't even worth looking at.
287616: The monitors leave you in the dark.
287656: The control panels have seen better days.
287696: The grip and vice are both covered in crumbling brown rust.
287744: The strip of metal is conveniently bent down the middle.
287792: It still sparkles like genuine sapphire.
287824: Sealed wooden crates have been stacked against the south wall, full of
forgotten spare parts. Steel runners form a metallic grid on the ceiling:
movement tracks for the last surviving winching crane.
287968: The rest of the chamber is to the north and northeast.
288016: You can only pray the rivets are reliable.
288056: Wooden packing crates stacked on pallets.
288120: The crawlspace is narrow, easily less than half a metre. Poor
ventilation has left a musty smell behind the stack of crates.
288208: There's no other exit other than the way you came in.
288246: Crunch.
288264: Looking at her won't make the threat go away.
288296: In the presence of the welding torch, the gate is only a minor
distraction to Joanna.
288360: She looks more dangerous than ever.
288392: Clang!
288464: The sword is the style used in medieval Japan, blade specially
sharpened to suit Joanna's needs. Serpents have been carved around the hilt,
mouths open yearning for food.
288584: Ratherly bizzarely, the serpents have had their eyes removed.
288640: You don't subscribe to psychos anonymous.
288672: Keith's voice is not something you want to listen to outside working
hours.
288728: Even if she were alive, you've forgotten the number.
288768: If you want to talk to yourself, here you are.
288816: Anybody who shouldn't be there won't answer.
288848: Nice try, but you're not getting any hints.
