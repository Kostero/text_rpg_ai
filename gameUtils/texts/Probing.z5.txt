15433: Nothing to do!
15468: o. You have won
15552: It is now pitch dark in here!
15579: I beg your pardon?
15643: Sorry, that can't be corrected.
15672: Think nothing of it.
15725: As good-looking as ever.
15757: You can hardly repeat that.
15782: You can't begin with a comma.
15896: I didn't understand that number.
15925: You can't see any such thing.
15961: You aren't holding that!

16055: That's not a verb I recognise.
16094: You can't see "
16202: Nothing to do!
16219: There are none at all available!
17129: Please answer yes or no.
17155: Are you sure you want to quit?

18512: Dropped.
18622: Removed.
18761: You lack the dexterity.
18842: Done.
19108: Done.
19319: Wrahn seem interested.
19900: You can't go that way.
20460: But it's dark.
20477: You find nothing of interest.
20513: But it's dark.
20604: You find nothing of interest.
21732: . Not bad.
21750: That was a rhetorical question.
21804: That seems unnecessary.
21827: Keep your mind on the game.
21852: What a good idea.
21871: You smell nothing unexpected.
21898: You hear nothing unexpected.
21923: You taste nothing unexpected.
21958: Keep your hands to yourself!
21983: You feel nothing unexpected.
22008: If you think that'll help.
22117: Oh, don't apologise.
22147: Quite.
22216: You achieve nothing by this.
22304: You wave, feeling foolish.
22454: You are unable to.
22473: Nothing obvious happens.
22523: That's not a direction.
22546: Not that way you can't.
22578: Keep your hands to yourself.
22603: You achieve nothing by this.
22636: Futile.
22665: You talk to yourself a while.
22692: This provokes no reaction.
22720: There is no reply.
22739: Nothing is on sale.
22758: Your singing is abominable.
22792: Time passes.
45643: It's not as small as that.
45705: It is permanently open.
45858: "Look, I have a job to do here."
45977: The official seems unimpressed.
46535: The officer seems unimpressed.
46595: You extract a single match.
46616: There are no more matches.
46637: You already have a match.
46705: The match is almost burned out.
46793: You can't quite reach the vent.
46925: The officer seems unimpressed.
46985: It currently contains nothing.
47094: The torch's batteries are flat.

51100: You can't go that way.
51432: Please give one of the answers above.
51460: [You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
51496: [Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
51536: "Oops" can only correct a single word.
51564: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
51596: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
51656: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
51700: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
51740: I didn't understand that sentence.
51800: You seem to have said too little!
51824: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
51860: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
51896: You excepted something not included anyway!
51928: You can only do that to something animate.
51960: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
52008: I didn't understand the way that finished.
52040: Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which exactly?
52192: Are you sure you want to restart?
52216: The game file has verified as intact.
52244: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupt.
52288: Attempt to begin transcript failed.
52316: Attempt to end transcript failed.
52340: You are carrying too much to hold.
52364: You can't put something on top of itself.
52396: You can't put something inside itself.
52452: You can only get into something freestanding.
52484: But you aren't in anything at the moment.
52516: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
52556: is now in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gives long
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
52652: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).
52736: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
52912: This dangerous act would achieve little.
52940: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
52972: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
53004: Digging would achieve nothing here.
53032: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
53060: You would achieve nothing by this.
53084: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
53112: But there's no water here to carry.
53140: Real adventurers do not use such language.
53172: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
53200: There's not enough water to swim in.
53228: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
53256: That would be less than courteous.
53280: Is that the best you can think of?
53304: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
53344: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
53376: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
53464: This is the place you have lived in for the last month and a bit. It was
all you could afford with the small pay you gleaned from countless rubbish
jobs. Looking back, you should have looked harder. The walls are unpapered, the
floor uncarpeted, and the room itself only contains a narrow, hard bed, a
dresser and a small television. The front door is to the west.
53724: The television came with the room, and is shot to hell. It only gives
you seventeen channels.
53792: You have better things to do than ogle the box.
53832: This bed has granted you many sleepless nights.
53872: The socks would only come back to haunt you.
53904: The comb is turquoise and is divided into narrow- and wide-teeth
sections. Isn't technology wonderful?
53980: A mailbox is screwed to the wall by the door.
54012: This is where letters sent from the receiver downstairs ends up - as
long as they're yours. Then again, that hasn't always been a necessary factor.
54116: It is addressed to you, and has apparently come from the Bureau of
Interstellar Employment! Hooray!
54188: The letterhead proclaims it to be from the Bureau of Interstellar
Employment.
54270: Connery's chief ensign has recently passed away, and we require someone
with your skills to take his place. The Connery is a scout ship surveying the
Federation borders and is currently in orbit around Triton waiting for you, so
please repair with all haste to your nearest Teleportation Centre with all your
necessary luggage. Show this letter to the attendant to be sent to your
posting. On behalf of the Bureau of Interstellar Employment, allow me to
congratulate you."
54600: You are traversing a squalid, dirty hallway connecting a multitude of
squalid, dirty apartments. Similar hallways snake off in all directions, but
the welcome exit door is to the north. Your apartment lies east.
54748: This place is like a maze. If you went that way you'd only get lost.
54800: The label on the side boasts that this drink can make you clever, sporty
and popular. You have found this not to be the case.
54888: You are not desperate enough to imbibe whatever bacteria-laden fluid
lurks in the darkness.
54952: What! Put that through this tiny little hole?
54988: An artificial sun shines down on this litter-strewn street on the
city-moon of Triton. An endless queue of hovercars speed along tarmac to the
north and east, blocking access in those directions. The pavement continues
west, and a grotty little apartment complex squats to the south.
55184: You blunder straight into the path of a passing hovercar. Your head is
crushed under the massive force of air pressure under the vehicle.
55280: You begin to cross the road, and are narrowly missed by a speeding
hovercar.
55336: Roads covered in endless streams of traffic surround you. Smog gets in
your face and causes you to cough. The pavement becomes a little more swept as
you approach the more swanky district - that is, the people here actually have
doormats. The pavement heads back east, and to the west is a government
building - the Teleportation Centre.
55572: You blunder straight into the path of a passing hovercar. Your head is
crushed under the massive force of air pressure under the vehicle.
55668: You begin to cross the road, and are narrowly missed by a speeding
hovercar.
55724: The only newspaper in circulation on Triton, the tabloid is nothing but
scaremongering and sensationalism.
55800: Lucky people go INTO the teleportation centre - unlucky people come OUT.
This is where people who have earned the money are beamed into an orbiting
spaceship, and where new arrivals who need some cheap accommodation are sent
from the passenger freighters. To the north is one of many teleportation
capsules.
56016: The interior of this place is very impressive. The rooms themselves are
huge, with sparkly clean walls and carpeted floors. You are standing in the
main area, where passengers are beamed up and down. To the north is one of many
teleportation capsules.
56192: The booth is pear-shaped, just big enough to admit a full-grown man, and
connected to an intricate network of wires and cables.
56284: The teleportation booth is meant for people, not that.
56324: Scowling behind his desk is a uniformed customs official.
56364: The man returns your stare down his nose. Clearly he gives the
impression that you are the least important thing to have crawled in off the
streets.
56500: "If you've been assigned to a spaceship, show me the relevant
documentation and you're away."
56568: "If you've been assigned to a spaceship, show me the relevant
documentation and you're away."
56636: I wouldn't try to cross the man if I were you.
56784: Connery is waiting for you, ENSIGN McSondheim," he says with barely
concealed dislike. "Step into the booth, press the 'ready' button and I'll do
the rest."
56904: The teleportation booth is poorly lit by the small window in the door to
the south, and coupled with the extremely small space in creates a terrific
sense of claustrophobia. The curved reflective walls cast twisted images of
yourself.
57064: You see the control room through the window.
57096: The panel by the door has only one, illuminated button.
57136: You press the button, and watch as the official enters a set of
co-ordinates and pulls a lever on his control desk. There is a brief whirring
of machinery before the tiny chamber fills with what looks like smoke and snow,
you feel the surface beneath your feet disappear, and quickly be replaced with
another.
57352: You are teleported to... nowhere. You have become a cloud of atoms
doomed to float around space forever. Needless to say you don't survive the
process.
57612: Connery. A door is set in the north wall, and a porthole is in the east.
57664: Oh, sure.
57672: You don't understand the panel. That's not your job.
57712: Stars on a black background twinkle at you. Dull, but at least it's not
Triton.
57772: Jacob Matthews, Captain of the Connery, is standing here heroically.
57824: Discovered new worlds, been to hell and back, became a legend - none of
these things have happened to Captain Matthews, because he commands a piddling
little routine scoutship.
57948: Discovered new worlds, been to hell and back, became a legend - none of
these things have happened to Captain Matthews, because he only commands a
piddling little routine scoutship.
58162: connery. I'm sure this will be an excellent start to your interstellar
career. Your shift isn't for another six or seven hours, so why don't you go
and recuperate in your quarters." With that, he hands you a keycard and leaves
the room.
58328: You're far too unimportant to go bothering the Captain now!
58372: It looks like a credit card, only bigger.
58404: This is a nondescript corridor on board the fairly small scoutship. The
walls are lined with conduits, pipes and cables you could never understand.
There is a door here stencilled with the name 'Ensign Second Class Martin
McSondheim.' Another corridor leads south.
58592: You don't have anywhere else to go.
58620: The door is devoid of handles, knobs or keypads. There is no obvious way
of opening it.
58684: There's no visible way of opening it.
58712: There is a panel built into the wall by the door.
58748: There is nothing on the panel but a small slot.
58784: There aren't any buttons - just a slot.
58814: You insert your keycard in the obvious slot, jiggle it about, and the
door ju-jungs open. You step inside, grinning.
58900: What? Put that in a keycard slot? Are you silly?
58936: Your quarters are pokey, but a damn sight better than the apartment on
Triton. It's divided into the Lounge, Sleeping and Bathroom Area, although the
latter two are more or less the same. A soft-looking bed with nice shiny sheets
is in the Sleeping Area, and the lounge area contains a low metal coffee table
and a single chair. There is a door to the south.
59192: The lounge area doesn't really live up to that name.
59232: The bed looks warm and inviting.
59256: You lie on your soft, warm bed, curl up and go to sleep. It'll be a few
hours before you'll need to work. 

Thus began your new job on the Connery. It
was an easy life - for a few hours a day you sat in front of the console panels
on the Bridge and do much easier things than were practised on the simulator at
the Academy. Then, one day, you were working perfectly happily when it
happened. It would change your life forever.
59564: You hear something move in the darkness...
59596: You flail around but, apart from a chittering sound, nothing happens.
59646: You hear a tiny chitter of triumph.
59674: You hear whatever creatures inhabit the darker areas of the ship crawl
out into the room.
59738: Something brushes against your leg. You kick outwards but nothing
connects.
59794: You just have time to sense a large crowd of thingies approaching before
you are stripped to your bones by nocturnal spaceship-dwellers!
59892: Since you work during the night shift, you and the commanding officer
are the only two people here. The room is wide, circular, and dominated by a
massive viewscreen showing a repetitive view of stars. In the centre of the
room the Captain's chair is positioned, and in front of the screen sits and
array of consoles. A door at the south end of the room leads away from the
bridge.
60156: You can't leave! You've got work to do!
60188: The console area is split into four stations - navigation,
communication, science and tactical. They are covered in touch-sensitive pads
which control the ship.
60300: You're already performing the correct routine with the controls.
60346: A beep makes you start. The console seems to think that something is
near the ship, but it soon disappears, so you pay no further heed.
60444: The computer reports a malfunction in Engineering, but, as before, the
signal disappears. You wonder if you should get it checked.
60538: Odd - a red light is flashing on and off on the console. This would
normally mean that red alert has been sounded. Maybe you should ask the
Commander about it.
60656: Stars. That's about it.
60676: First Officer Commander Stephen Richards is here, taking command.
60724: Since it's the night shift, the Captain is currently in bed and his
First Officer has taken command.
60796: Commander Richards does not understand.
60824: "This ship's a beaut, isn't she? I'm sure it'll look good on my resume
when I try to find work somewhere else."
60908: "He's a fine officer, and an example to us all."
60944: "You've done a good job since you arrived. If you find a better job, I'd
be happy to write a statement about you.
61026: You point out the flashing light, and ask Commander Richards if he
sounded red alert. He replies to the negative, and tries to cancel red alert.
Nothing happens. 

    "Odd," he says, "the Captain's console doesn't seem to
be responding. I hope he doesn't make me pay for that." 

    Then you notice
that none of your controls are working either. You point this out, and the
Commander becomes more and more anxious. 

    He taps his communicator.
"Engineering, this is the bridge." There is no response. "Engineering,
respond." Still, a stony silence. 

    You notice that lights are winking off
irregularly on your control panel. "It seems that electrics systems are
shutting off one by -" you are interrupted by the persistent humming of the
engine suddenly stopping and the lights turning off.
61604: You have nothing to say about that.
61632: "I don't know anything about that."
61660: The commander has no interest in your sordid life.
61696: Don't try to upset him, he could get you fired.
61732: You picked it up on shore leave a few weeks ago, and it bears the name
of a bar in which you met a woman with whom you totally failed to get off with,
or even talk to. You keep the matchbook as sentiment, and there can't be many
matches left.
61900: If you want to get a match out, try "OPEN MATCHBOOK".
61948: The match flares with a small amount of smoky light.
61984: Your fingers burn on the flame and you are forced to put the match out.
Seeing no further use for it, you throw the match away.
62076: Plunged into darkness, the Bridge is suddenly a lot less appealing.
Consoles seem to leap out at you, the Captain's chair has become a silhouette
of something poised to pounce. You can just make out the exit door to the south
and a ventilation shaft above you.
62260: The doors have stopped working. Perhaps the power has been shut off.
62308: The door will not open if the electrics are down, and is shut far too
tightly to prise open.
62372: The ventilation system circulates air around the ship. The shafts are
just about big enough to admit a man.
62446: By standing on the chair you are able to yank open the ventilation shaft
and crawl inside. Commander Richards shouts up at you to go to engineering to
find out what happened.
62572: First Officer Commander Stephen Richards is here, looking worried.
62624: The Commander seems tense. From what little light there is here you see
that his face is damp with sweat.
62700: Commander Richards does not understand.
62728: "I don't know what's going on. One of us will have to go to engineering
and find out what's going on. Since I'm the senior officer, I delegate you."
62840: "Jesus, Martin, is this really the time or the place?"
62884: "Jesus, Martin, is this really the time or the place?"
62928: Don't try to upset him, he could get you fired.
62964: You are crawling on your hands and knees through the ship's ventilation
system. What little light filters in from emergency lighting in various parts
of the ship only lets you see in your immediate vicinity. The shaft continues
north.
63128: You are crawling on your hands and knees through the ship's ventilation
system. What little light filters in from emergency lighting in various parts
of the ship only lets you see in your immediate vicinity. The shaft continues
north.
63292: You are crawling on your hands and knees through the ship's ventilation
system. What little light filters in from emergency lighting in various parts
of the ship only lets you see in your immediate vicinity. The shaft continues
south, and below you is a closed panel which presumably swings aside.
63496: The panel is closed.
63512: You kick downwards, and the panel suddenly bursts open and you tumble to
the floor below, bruising your bum.
63588: You are perched on an unsafe gantry high above an empty cargo bay. Using
modern technology it hovers in mid-air but no-one seemed to see fit to put a
fence round it. A rope ladder leads down, and there is a control panel in
reach.
63748: Ha, no. The vent is too high to reach.
63780: That would not be the best idea.
63804: A huge magnetic crane lurks above.
63828: Hanging from the ceiling is the magnetic crane, used for moving heavy
metal things around.
63892: The crane contains a big metal crate.
63920: They must control the magnetic crane.
63946: The crate crashes down onto the platform, which promptly shatters into
millions of rusty metal bits. As the crate tumbles into darkness, as does the
power pack for the hovering gantry, and you are thrown off. Fortunately you are
spared a hideous bloody death when your flailing hand grabs the side of a
ladder which goes up the side of the shaft. Counting your blessings, you begin
to descend.
64220: The crane begins to emit a low buzzing noise as you activate the
electromagnet.
64276: The metal crate leaps up and sticks to the crane in an almost balletic
movement.
64332: Nothing else transpires, so you turn it off to save power.
64376: This superfluous cargo bay was purchased as part of a two-for-one offer,
and contains very little. It is not really a room in itself - merely a rusty
platform positioned a long way up a disused coolant shaft. A rope ladder leads
up to a gantry.
64548: It's a standard disposable ship-issue hand-held torch. These ones gobble
up battery power notoriously fast.
64624: Your torch appears to be dimming.
64652: The torch goes out. These disposable things last fifteen minutes and the
batteries can't be replaced, but at least they don't eat into the budget.
64756: A heavy metal crate is positioned here. The floor underneath seems to
sag alarmingly, but remains in one piece.
64836: With a great amount of effort, you succeed in pushing the crate into
more or less the centre of the platform.
64912: There's no way you could or would move that again.
64948: When ship engines were much bigger and less ecumenical, they often
required coolant systems which would stop the components and emissions from
overheating or reacting catastrophically. This shaft is part of that system,
but since the engine was upgraded it has fallen into disuse and is now used as
a storeroom when the crew has things to store. There is a hatch to the east.
65204: You are in a section of corridor on the engineering deck of the ship. A
storeroom is to the west, and the corridor heads south and east.
65300: You are in a section of corridor on the engineering deck of the ship.
The actual engineering area is to the south, while a door marked with a snake
coiled around a staff is the east. Otherwise the corridor goes back west.
65452: The door appears to be locked.
65476: Next to the door is a panel.
65496: It looks similar to the one outside your quarters - except this one
doesn't even have a slot.
65562: Sickening yourself slightly, you press the disembodied palm against the
panel, and after a couple of clicks and beeps the door slides aside. You step
in, and the door closes behind you.
65696: You push your hand against the panel. Nothing happens.
65736: You are in a section of corridor on the engineering deck of the ship. To
the west are a pair of lift doors, and the corridor leads north.
65832: You approach the doors, but they don't open. Not surprising, seeing as
this isn't Star Trek and will only open when you press the button.
65932: The button is marked with an 'up' arrow. This is the lowest point in the
ship.
65988: You push the button and, after a few seconds, the lift doors hum open
and you step in. Naturally the doors close afterwards.
66076: It would appear to be the remains of someone's lunch.
66116: You try to eat it, but it transmutes into a shape-changing chameleonic
life form and bites your face off. No, I tell a lie, you eat it and instantly
die from food poisoning, the sandwich having been on the floor in the
engineering deck for seven and a half years.
66300: You crouch slightly under a section of fallen ceiling, and look around
at the tableau. It looks like there was some kind of explosion. Debris is
everywhere, the walls and floor are black and charred, and some unidentifiable
black lumps lie around in awkward angles. You hope they are not what you think
they are.
66516: The scene of devastation remains consistent on the far side of the
engineering area, but not as extreme. Identifiable bodies litter the floor, the
computer banks to the sides have been destroyed by flying shrapnel. Archways
lead north and east.
66684: James Frotz, the Chief Engineer, is unconscious on the floor.
66732: He seems to be in a pretty deep sleep. He's not going to be brought
round by being shouted at.
66800: Chatting to someone rather requires them being conscious.
66840: Chatting to someone rather requires them being conscious.
66880: I think you have to seek his permission.
66908: You administer the stimulant. James stirs and wakes after a few seconds,
then looks at you with sudden concern. "Martin!" he says. "We thought everyone
upstairs was dead! We had a warp core breach - I don't think anyone else
survived down here, but the powers off!" His hands search the debris until he
finds a small, glowing rock, which he presses into your hand. "The backup
generator is still online, but you'll need this to start it up. I'll meet you
on the bridge." With that, he rises unsteadily to his feet and leaves the room.
67288: Dumdeedium, a highly unstable but non-radioactive element, is used to
power most federation starships.
67360: As soon as you touch the highly unstable element there is a massive core
breach. You are instantly killed, and the rest of the crew drop dead a few
hours later due to life support failure. Congratulations, you have just brought
about the extinction of the Connery.
67544: You retrieve the chunk of dumdeedium. Well, maybe it needs polishing.
67596: Yes, you've guessed it, this part of engineering is in a similar state
of disarray to everywhere else. Once again debris is spread all over the floor
and there are archways to the north, south and west.
67736: Spread extremely evenly over the floor is a mangled corpse.
67780: Judging by what tiny shreds of clothing remained, whoever this was was a
member of the medical staff.
67852: There is nothing on the hand which suggests who it belongs to.
67896: Judging by the wide circle of soot around this area, this is where the
explosion came from. In the centre of the circle is the burnt-out husk of the
warp core, in which you see little glowing bits of metal and tendrils of power
going back and forth over the mangled components. Archways to the west and
south lead to other sections of engineering.
68136: The air above the ultra-hot core is still wavering with heat haze.
68184: Placed logically near the engineering section, the medical unit is a
circular room with recovery bunks all round the walls. The centre of the room
is occupied by a vast table. Strangely, there doesn't seem to be anyone here. A
door is to the west.
68356: Judging by the label, the syringe contains a strong stimulant.
68400: It looks like the Captain's confidential medical report. "Captain
Matthews is in perfect shape." Well, that was worth keeping secret.
68500: It's a child-proof safety bottle. The label reads 'aspirin'.
68548: No amount of tugging opens the bottle.
68576: Good idea. By throwing the bottle against the hard floor, you cause the
bottle to crack open.
68644: You quickly take the tablet, and find the weird humming noise a lot more
bearable.
68704: Aspirin in the 23rd century is more advanced than you think. When it
finds no pain or illness to combat in your body, it combats your immune system
instead. You roll around in pain for an hour before losing the battle.
68856: This surprisingly small room contains the backup generator. It's not as
powerful as the main generator and only supplies power for light, life support
and the most necessary electronic systems. A control panel is situated next to
it, and an archway lies north.
69036: At the foot of the generator is a circular compartment.
69076: You flick the switch, the generator starts up, and slowly but surely the
emergency lighting comes on. That means you can turn your torch off, by the
way.
69184: Plunging the ship back into no-electricity-world would cause chaos -
people stuck in lifts, engines backfiring, dispensing machines going doolally -
and you'd probably be the recipient of some stern words and a pink slip.
69340: Although it is recommended that you don't use the lifts in an emergency
power situation, they are the only way to really get around the ship. There're
always the vents, as long as you don't mind being minced to death every now and
again. The lift is small, but oddly cosy.
69530: You push the button and, after a few seconds, the doors open, and you
step out. The doors close again.
69608: There's nothing for you on level one. Perhaps you should go to the
bridge now that power is restored.
69680: There's nothing for you on level two. Perhaps you should go to the
bridge now that power is restored.
69752: You push the button and, after a few seconds, the doors open, and you
step out. The doors close again.
69828: You stop when you see Commander Richards and James Frotz standing in the
corridor.
69888: The humming noise has become as loud and high as it's going to.
69932: A flash of white engulfs the corridor, and you feel the floor beneath
your feet taken away. Your two colleagues disappear into an ever-expanding
void, and you are left alone. Never before have you felt so lonely.
70084: First Officer Commander Stephen Richards is here, looking worried.
70136: The Commander seems tense. From what little light there is here you see
that his face is damp with sweat.
70212: Commander Richards does not understand.
70240: "Jesus, Martin, is this really the time or the place?"
70284: "Jesus, Martin, is this really the time or the place?"
70328: Don't try to upset him, he could get you fired.
70364: Chief Engineer James Frotz is here, also looking worried.
70408: In this slightly better light you see that his suit is slightly burned
off in places, and his skin is dirty with smoke fumes.
70496: "Never mind that, what are we going to do?"
70528: "Never mind that, what are we going to do?"
70560: Don't try to upset him, he could get you fired.
70594: You stare at the viewscreen in surprise. There, not fifty kilometres
from the ship, is the most curious of things. It looks like a lump of plastic
which has been held over flame for a bit then chewed for a while, except
unpleasantly organic.

"We think it's doing an offensive probe on us," says
Commander Richards. "That's where it shuts down all the ship's power as it
scans our systems."
70876: You suddenly become aware of a low humming noise, gradually increasing
in pitch.
70932: The humming becomes unpleasantly loud and high-pitched. It's giving you
a slight headache.
70996: The noise is becoming unbearable, making your head pulse and ache
intolerably.
71052: The Commander and the Chief Engineer are much more experienced and have
much more experience than you, so they have the mental power to block out this
intrusion. You, however, are just a rookie, and the sound causes you to suffer
a major brain haemorrhage.
71232: You see nothing, not because there is no light, but because there is
nothing to see.
71292: You float in that direction for a bit.
71320: Your stomach turns as you are wrenched from the void...

Look out for
the next instalment of Offensive Probing!
71404: You see nothing. Not because there is nothing to see, but because there
is no light.
