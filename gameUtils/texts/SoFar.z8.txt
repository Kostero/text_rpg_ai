71353: You're already wearing that!
71403: That's plainly inedible.
71436: Not bad.
71452: That was a rhetorical question.
71480: This dangerous act would achieve little.
71514: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
71550: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
71638: What a good idea.
71658: You smell nothing unexpected.
71712: You taste nothing unexpected.
71792: You feel nothing unexpected.
71818: Digging would achieve nothing here.
71850: Cutting that up would achieve little.
71882: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
71916: You would achieve nothing by this.
71946: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
71980: But there's no water here to carry.
72012: Oh, don't apologise.
72034: Real adventurers do not use such language.
72070: Quite.
72082: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
72116: There's not enough water to swim in.
72148: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
72182: You can't usefully blow that.
72260: No, you can't set that to anything.
72323: But you aren't holding that.
72388: It is fixed in place.
72410: You are unable to.
72430: That would be less than courteous.
72455: Nothing obvious happens.
72484: Is that the best you can think of?
72514: That's not a direction.
72533: Not that way you can't.
72583: You achieve nothing by this.
72614: Futile.
72621: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
72670: You talk to yourself a while.
72693: This provokes no reaction.
72721: There is no reply.
72741: Nothing is on sale.
72787: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
72825: Time passes.
72841: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
72938: You lean out of the shade and look up. The sun scorches you from one
side of a metal-blue sky.
73013: The sky is a deep untouched blue, shaded with violet. The sun is low in
the west.
73080: Scraps of cloud drift along soft clear blue. The sun is low.
73133: The sky is so wide as to seem flat, a plane of pure blue parallel with
the grass. The sun nears the western horizon.
73224: The sky is a bowl of harsh bright blue, unforgiving and as cold as the
ice here below.
73295: Beams of dark and light seem to radiate from the west, etched from the
sunlight which slices across the ragged cliff-top above.
73394: Beams of dark and light seem to radiate from the west, etched from the
sunlight which slices across the ragged cliff-top to the west.
73497: Beams of dark and light seem to radiate from the west, etched from the
sunlight which slices across the ridge-crest.
73583: The sun is low in the west.
73612: The sun is a tiny glaring spot, low in the west, but the sky is dark and
thick with stars.
73733: The moons are also visible. Warel is already high; Amwal is just rising,
but she will soon be catching up, approaching tonight's lunar event.
73844: The moons are also visible; Warel is high, Amwal a bit above the
horizon.
73909: The moons are also visible; Warel is high, Amwal well above the horizon.
73972: The moons are also visible. Warel is close to the zenith; Amwal in the
middle sky, to the east.
74049: i. The moons are also visible. Amwal is high; Warel nearly at zenith.
74110: The moon Warel is nearly at zenith; Amwal is a little lower, to the
east.
74175: Both moons are approaching the zenith, and each other.
74518: You are shivering violently.
74553: Your hands and feet are becoming numb.
74594: The cold is a vague ache through your blood, and it is hard to move.
74657: The world seems to crawl, sluggishly. You cannot muster the energy to
shiver any more.
74733: The world dims and swirls. You must have fallen, for the snow is
supporting your body, but it's too cold to hurt anymore.
74988: Your hands and feet are prickling, painfully alive.
75039: The chill is fading from your blood.
75076: You're unpleasantly warm, muffled in that blanket.
75179: The sounds around you are barely diminished; you give up.
75222: This is unlikely to improve matters.
75254: Someone is confused.
75278: They're attached.
75300: Your ears are relatively clean.
75363: Your parents warned you against this sort of behavior.
75423: It'th a pink bwuw connecthing your thathe t'o the pole.
75464: Your tongue is not limber enough to manage this. If it were, well, mmm,
never mind.
75548: It'th thtuck.
75561: Any number of feeble jokes about cats come to mind.
75608: You wi'th.
75619: It's, well, attached.
75665: That would look astonishingly stupid.
75697: Oww!
75707: Oww!
75722: Yeah, wighth.
75735: By definition, you taste nothing unexpected.
75775: Your tongue can't contain things.
75810: You can'th!
75821: You've never been tongue-tied.
75851: There's no need to get tongue-tied.
75927: You reach into the shadow, and in, in, and the farther you stretch the
farther there is to go -- you pull back, shivering.
76033: You can't even see what's in the shadow.
76150: Rito and Imita are glaring at each other.
76186: Rito is blazing fury at the defiant Imita.
76222: Imita stares helplessly off at the vanished Rito.
76264: Rito advances on Tato, as Imita looks on.
76302: Rito and Tato face each other, as Imita looks on.
76344: Rito and Tato circle each other, as Imita looks on.
76388: Rito and Tato are locked in a whirl of ringing metal, and Imita backs
away.
76448: Tato lies at Rito's feet, blood drenching his back. Imita is astonished
and exultant together at what she has done.
76536: Rito and Imita embrace over Tato's corpse.
76574: The stage is set only with scattered flowers and a pool of blood.
76628: The players are bowing furiously.
76653: The stage is dark and empty, but for scattered flowers and ribbons.
76731: The play is into the final act. Rito has finally found out about Imita's
affair, and he stalks the stage, whipping voice and hands about himself. A
footfall behind him; he turns, and sees Imita. She backs a step at the force of
his gaze.
76927: The players continue....
77048: Young lord, I will not kneel. And shadowed dark,
77124: my flesh is mine. Or nearly so; I find --
77172: Say on! What more has hated Tato done?
77229: Oh, do not hate. For dazzled though she was,
77307: But nearly, for she carries Tato's son.
77351: She -- you -- you say -- aah!
77422: Imita turns and pleads her dilemma to the audience: "What scourge, what
scourge I bear, from what red star / So near to happiness, and yet so far?" She
is in despair; but this whispered soliloquy is soon interrupted by voices
rising in the wings. Rito, in a fury, backs Tato onto the stage.
77772: Foul luck...
77798: Enough!
77869: Good red to flood the black ebb of your luck.
77999: I would withdraw. But if my mistress' word
78071: The blood of any hound. Attend thy sword!
78188: And the tangling thorn fell the step you first took...
78309: The pure tone of steel against steel. It comes again, and again faster;
and then Rito and Tato rush at each other in a fury of chimes, in harmony. The
sounds come from off-stage, of course, not from the swords. That's the way it's
done. Melody weaves into the ringing, counterpoint to the flow of the fight --
falter, recover, the upper hand lost and gained -- and two men and two swords
flicker in electric light.
78614: uhm
Rito gains enough breath between attacks to declaim an insult or
three. "War-rat, peace-pup / Love's-fool / Bright-tongue, limp slug..." Tato
leaps for him again, another bell-jangle of motion. Dancing, even yet, Rito
falls back.
78841: To she whose glance you melt to see?
78940: Rito cannot even speak; the pain and horror are all in his eyes. And
then they are in Tato's eyes too, and the spear that jerks in Tato's back is
barely an afterthought. He jolts forward a step, tries to catch himself on
Rito's wrapped velvets. But Rito backs, still silent, and Tato lands on his
knees; reaches again; and falls.
79183: Imita, spear-hand still outflung, is on her knees as well.
79234: i.
Rito moves forward, slowly, around the shape that lies before him. He
draws Imita to her feet. She gazes at his face, with not a flicker at the dark
wet that stains his velvets. (And you don't even wonder at the players'-craft
that makes it so. The stage is gone; their faces are the moment.)
79460: Ah, my love. Can you forgive me?
79502: How can I deny you? There is nothing to forgive.
79551: The audience sighs, released. The rest of the play is accomplished with
commendable speed: wedding flowers, declarations of passion, bells and drums.
Tato's corpse is carried reverently away; and the procession follows.
79712: As the stage empties, someone behind you begins to clap.
79778: The players sweep out of the wings, bowing. Everyone is on their feet
and applauding wildly
79909: The players dash offstage, and return a bare heartbeat later. People are
shrieking, and flinging flowers, ribbons, sweetmeats, and occasionally
themselves at the stage.
80045: The tumult finally begins to rattle to a halt, and people start to drift
towards the doors. The players, giving in to the inevitable, bow themselves
into the wings and are gone.
80179: a.
A wrinkled old man, laden with damp rags, pokes irritably at your
elbow. "Move yar," he mumbles
80387: ypm
The crowd has dissipated. The energy of the play is gone, leaving
the gloom merely cavernous and dim. On the other hand, it's no longer quite so
stiflingly hot.
80519: Thematically apt, but in practice the theater management would object.
80648: You applaud happily with the rest of the audience.
80685: You applaud the empty stage for a few moments. Then, suddenly uneasy,
you turn -- the old man is staring curiously at you. After a long cold pause,
he looks away and goes back to scrubbing.
80838: You open your mouth, and draw breath. Someone jabs an elbow irritably
into your side.
80908: You essay a few notes, which are mostly drowned in applause. A few
people look at you oddly.
80975: You essay a few notes, which echo wonderfully in the empty hall. Then,
suddenly uneasy, you turn -- the old man is staring curiously at you. After a
long cold pause, he looks away and goes back to scrubbing.
81134: You're sitting down.
81164: The people behind you just might start a riot.
81236: You can't see Aessa anywhere.
81281: "Quiet!" hisses someone behind you, grouchily.
81318: Oh, what a good idea.
81372: You shake your head, trying to net your straying thoughts, and catch a
flash of copper hair. A few rows back, by the aisle -- Aessa couldn't have
shown up and
81540: You can no longer see Aessa, if you did at all.
81584: Irritable mutters rise behind you as you crane your neck.
82166: You're not the one on stage here.
82216: Oh, stop bothering the actors.
82239: "Hissh!" mutters someone behind you, irritably.
82283: Oh, stop bothering the actors.
82306: You're not the one on stage here.
82343: Rito is a tall young man, clad in blue and violet, the rich wrapped
velvets of the Lily Years. His face is pale, his eyes dark haggard shadows.
82456: Rito is not on-stage.
82487: Imita is (of course) a beautiful young woman, in intricately layered
silks, sea-grey, sea-green. Her eyes are reddened, and a tear-mark sparkles
down her face.
82614: Imita is not on-stage.
82647: Tato is a tall, powerful man, clad in red and violet wrapped velvets.
His face is tinged with red, and his brows are heavy and dark.
82752: Tato is not on-stage.
82784: That's all down on the stage.
82817: If nothing else, you have a good seat.
82849: If nothing else, you had a good seat.
82878: The stage is only a few rows to the north.
82918: People are jammed on benches in every direction; you think the aisle is
somewhere to the west.
82996: Everyone is on their feet, but you think the aisle is somewhere to the
west.
83051: You are surrounded by empty benches; the aisle is somewhere to the west.
83155: You push yourself to your feet. Naturally, your spot on the bench
instantly vanishes in the crush.
83235: You join the rest of the standing ovation.
83266: You push yourself to your feet.
83310: The aisle is somewhere off to the west.
83353: Wood, barely polished, not clean.
83380: Wood, barely polished... but clean.
83424: This is not going to happen. The benches are barely-smoothed tree
trunks.
83480: This is not going to happen. The benches are barely-smoothed tree
trunks, and there are people sitting all over them.
83574: You're already seated.
83605: A shadowy shape mutters, "Kick out. It's full."
83658: You see much mud and many feet, but nothing important.
83697: The floor is nicely clean.
83736: You sit down, earning yourself disapproving glares from your fellow
play-goers.
83793: You sit, enjoying the elbow-room.
83835: You are adrift in a sea of knees. People squirm to give you room,
glowering politely around you as they try to watch the play.
83936: You are adrift in a sea of cheering play-goers.
83974: You are adrift in a sea of empty benches.
84005: The aisle is nearby, west, and your seat is far in to the east.
84122: The aisle is just to the west.
84154: It's packed -- people sitting on the steps, leaning against the walls.
None of them look familiar, however.
84272: The aisle is to the west.
84307: It's actually harder to navigate here in the aisle. People are sitting
on the steps, leaning up against the wall, and in some places perched on the
gas-lights. The aisle extends north and south from here, but towards the stage
it's even more crowded.
84496: It's actually harder to navigate here in the aisle. People are
everywhere on their feet, clapping madly. The aisle extends north and south
from here, but towards the stage it's even more crowded.
84638: The aisle is almost roomy now that everyone is gone. It extends north
and south.
84695: Your seat is somewhere deep in the benches to the east.
84815: The front of the aisle is entirely packed.
84863: The front of the aisle is entirely packed.
84898: You're halfway up the aisle on the west side of the theater.
84950: It's still full of people, but you can maneuver north and south.
85000: Everything is dim.
85082: It's a bare fingerwidth across and perhaps a yard long; just a gap where
the wall planks have warped. A hint of cool air breathes out of it.
85206: There is a crack in the west wall.
85271: Your smallest finger might make it through. The rest of you won't.
85327: The wall planking is too thick to get any kind of view through the
crack.
85386: It's gone, and there it is again -- a touch of cool air. You turn your
head from side to side, feeling... it seems to be coming from a crack in the
west wall.
85531: The air smells of dry leaves, smoke, distant frost; autumn.
85599: Unlikely.
85672: You feel the faintest cool breath of air.
85713: Again, you feel that cool thread of air across your face.
85779: Wait. Wait. What's ever cool in this suffocating summer heat? It comes
again, slight, smoky, deep with autumn. Impossible.
85883: You've struggled your way to the top of the aisle; the theater stretches
away to the north and east. Everything east is a solid mass of benches and
people, of course, and more playgoers are lined up along the back wall. Wide
doors to the south lead outside.
86067: You're at the top of the aisle; the theater stretches away to the north
and east, echoing dark. Everything east is a solid mass of benches, of course.
Wide doors to the south lead outside.
86242: You escape into the searing light of the high summer afternoon. The air
is still oppressively hot, but at least it's fresh, and the theater portico
gives a bit of shade.
86378: The other benches aren't important.
86418: The wrinkled old man is scrubbing slowly under some benches nearby.
86488: The old man slowly glances up to you, and then he slowly glances back
down to his rag, and then he starts scrubbing again. Slowly.
86581: He looks like he has enough problems.
86616: The old man's rag isn't important.
86659: If you start crawling over people in here, you're likely to be hung from
a scene-scaffold before the play is over.
86749: If you start crawling over people in here, you're likely to be hung from
a scene-scaffold.
86819: The wrinkled old man gives you such a slow, incandescent glare that you
retreat to the aisle.
86930: You're by the theater's west wall.
86986: You push through the crowd...
87070: you find a knee jammed unpleasantly in your path. You manage not to
trip. The owner of the knee mumbles pungently, jams it out of your way (into
someone else's), and curtly gestures you to pass.
87311: you slam up against a solid wall of sweaty shoulders. A vigorous elbow
or two helps break the wall apart.
87426: You resolutely put the theater and its oddities from your mind. That
leaves you with, well, Aessa and her oddities, and that depressing thought
occupies you through the long hot miserable streets.
87566: You hesitate at the curb.
87590: That cool draft of air back in the theater -- surely it deserves some
investigation.
87654: There was something back in the theater, something out of place.
87794: But you don't see Aessa anywhere.
87843: You edge closer to the argument about the moons. You've heard most of it
before, actually. Are the two moons chunks of stone, with no more meaning to
their endless circling than there would be if they fell? Or are they emanations
of spirit, changing like the moods of the gods, with no physical substance to
them at all? The astronomers can argue the cases for months. Which
88112: led to something new -- you lean closer -- there's a proposal to reach
out and see, somehow. Something about a beam of light? You don't understand the
worked arts.
88233: People talk about the awful weather, the council, cyclia teams, the
miserable weather... summer talk in the city.
88339: Nobody pays much attention to you.
88364: Oh, what a good idea.
88417: A couple of people nearby are discussing the moons. That's right;
tonight is the night that the astronomers have been going on about. You'll have
to be sure to watch. Snuggled in a blanket, ideally... if you ever find Aessa.
88598: You haven't any coin; you spent the last of this week's on the play.
Anyway, you're more a let-cider person.
88704: The beer isn't yours, and anyway you're more a let-cider person.
88754: More people are relaxing here, perhaps because of the kegman who sells
his beer under the theater portico. The main street bakes in sunlight to the
south; the front of the theater continues to the north, adorned by some
decorative potted shrubs.
88932: Half-hidden behind the shrubs is a doorway.
88978: You resolutely put the theater and its oddities from your mind. That
leaves you with, well, Aessa and her oddities, and that depressing thought
occupies you through the long hot miserable streets.
89118: You hesitate at the curb.
89142: That cool draft of air back in the theater -- surely it deserves some
investigation.
89206: There was something back in the theater, something out of place.
89289: Ignoring the sign, you slip inside.
89321: You slip behind the shrubs, and discover a concealed doorway! (What a
shock.) Ignoring a sign on the jamb, you slip inside.
89426: It's gone, and there it is again -- a touch of cool air. You turn your
head from side to side, feeling... it seems to be coming from the direction of
the potted shrubs.
89571: The air smells of dry leaves, smoke, distant frost; autumn.
89639: Unlikely.
89712: You feel the faintest cool breath of air.
89759: Again, you feel that cool thread of air across your face.
89913: ust beer. Two coin, two," chants the kegman. "Beer, is only."
89998: "Sharp beer, two coin, two," chants the kegman.
90041: ust beer. Two coin, two," chants the kegman. "Beer, is only."
90125: There's no need to harass him.
90154: You know nothing about gardening. Whatever the shrubs are, they're tall,
leafy, and not quite dead of the heat.
90293: There's a doorway behind them.
90351: You notice a doorway, half-hidden behind the shrubs.
90393: There's a doorway behind the shrubs.
90442: You emerge, and drift out from behind the potted shrubs.
90507: The air smells of dry leaves, smoke, distant frost; autumn.
90569: Unlikely.
90648: The coolness touches your face again.
90687: That cool touch of air stirs past you.
90722: The stuff here is neither yours nor important.
90772: The door is closed.
90799: The door is closed.
90819: You can't see under the door.
90850: It's locked; the handle is immobile.
90886: That doesn't seem to fit the lock.
90927: The voices can only barely be heard, now.
91051: Sharp voices filter out through the door. They are too muffled to make
out more than the tone of anger.
91232: Faint sobs drift through the closed door.
91301: The voices come from behind the door.
91328: They're just voices.
91363: The air smells of dry leaves, smoke, distant frost; autumn.
91425: Unlikely.
91504: The coolness touches your face again.
91543: That cool touch of air stirs past you.
91590: There is a crack in the east wall.
91655: Your smallest finger might make it through. The rest of you won't.
91711: The wall planking is too thick to get any kind of view through the
crack.
91770: The air here is rich with autumn, brisk and cool. It's impossible,
absurd.
91851: You smell dry leaves, smoke, distant frost; autumn.
91909: Unlikely.
91976: The air swirls briskly around you.
92017: The light is hot on your skin, even filtered through dirt.
92104: It's just light.
92124: There is nothing in the light but some drifting dust.
92276: Glass may not be the folly of the rich any more, but you're still
unwilling to break it.
92346: Blackness lies behind the cabinet. Opaque... in this brightly lit room,
no shadow should be so thick.
92472: A sunbeam might shine off crystal to paint the whole world white for one
angle of an instant; so this shadow widens into a gulf beneath black and wider
than everything. Then you move a fraction farther, and it is only a line of
too-black behind chipped wood.
92654: The darkness widens and narrows, impossibly, as you shift your line of
vision back and forth.
92742: ausfxm slides into the shadow, in a way which has nothing to do with the
narrow space behind the cabinet. Then, without your ever quite having let go,
it is gone.
92878: again as you set foot to it. The cabinet is to your left and the wall to
your right, never mind the space that isn't there between them, and then never
mind anything because blackness has taken the world, never mind, never world,
not even you, never you --
93143: A closed cabinet, chipped and stained, stands against the wall. Sunlight
brings a tattered, hopeful glow out of the old wood, but shadow falls behind.
93253: A cabinet, chipped and stained, stands against the wall. Sunlight brings
a tattered, hopeful glow out of the old wood, but shadow falls behind.
93375: The cabinet is old, but heavily made, and it's taller than you.
93432: The cabinet is not open.
93667: The cabinet rests on the floor; you can't see under it.
93718: The cabinet is too heavy to move.
93834: You swing open the door. The cabinet is mostly empty; bare shelves and
hooks and a scatter of dust. But on the top shelf rests an unusual, off-square
wooden box, its rich polish at odds with the battered panels that surround it.
94007: You can't see any such thing.
94030: The shelves and hooks aren't important.
94081: You essay a few notes, holding the box close to your mouth. The sound is
immense: a resonant thrum, echoing you in harmonics that shift subtly with your
voice.
94194: You essay a few notes. The odd wooden box resonates slightly, producing
a faint thrum that shifts with your voice.
94287: None of the seams of the box look to be meant to open.
94331: It's already closed, assuming it opens at all.
94371: You turn the box over in your hands. No side looks much different from
any other side.
94437: The wood is smooth and richly polished.
94471: The wood responds with a unexpectedly rich hiss as your fingers move
across it.
94558: You tap the box, which responds with a deep, resonant note.
94619: You tap the box, which responds with a higher note than before.
94669: You tap the box in several places; the resulting notes glance oddly up
and down the scale.
94745: The discs are set in flush, and do not seem to move.
94789: You cannot turn the discs, even when pressing your nails into the
incised marks.
94851: The discs do not seem to move at all.
94885: You rap on one of the pale discs. It produces only a muffled clack.
94946: But something is wrong. The darkness remains, and the burning is no part
of it; the pain is you. Everything you know fades away, black to black, leaving
only slow fire that grows and grows. And ends.
95098: You stroll for a while towards the wall.
95138: The wall stretches across the north, as far as you can see in both
directions, and it's huge. Dark and massive, even off in the distance as it is.
You can make out
95471: The wall is nearly a mile away.
95575: The trees are tall, and you're not much of an athlete.
95621: You approach a tree. It feels like a tree. Rough, and just a bit warmer
than it ought. Friendly.
95706: You stroll for a while towards the forest.
95746: You stroll for a while, up to the wall.
95828: Passing the chimney, you bring yourself abruptly short. Did something
move? There is only grass; and the fading sense of a precipice behind the worn
brick.
95956: There's no need to start a collection.
95998: You pick up a dusty chunk of brick from the weeds.
96043: The remaining stub of chimney, you find, is remaining because it's
pretty sturdy.
96109: Only one corner of the chimney is still standing. There's no inside,
particularly.
96202: The chimney's shadow is thick as black silk.
96351: You smell nothing. A hint of breeze touches you from behind.
96503: as you set foot to it. The old brick of the chimney looms impossibly
above you, blotting out the sun, the sky, the darkness before you, your name --
96625: -- Everything drops silently into place again. You are staring at a bale
of hay.
96690: The wall stretches across the north, and it's even bigger than it looked
from the forest edge. Massive stone blocks march in their rows, in both
directions, as far as you can see. The road stretches up to an immense gate.
96860: There a single black pillar rises, nearly as high as the wall.
96908: There a single black pillar rises, nearly as high as the wall; and
another leans crazily, almost touching the first.
96996: There a black pillar rises on either side, each nearly as high as the
wall.
97063: The wall is nearly half a mile away.
97120: They're off to the west. You'll have to approach them.
97184: Nothing of the ruins looks worth taking.
97225: You haven't any use for the meadow plants.
97261: The weeds smell dusty, with a hint of green.
97326: You find nothing else.
97351: You poke under the vines that cover the mound. Just dirt... no, there's
a bit of blue showing. You tug at it, then twist, trying to dislodge the vine
tendrils that clutch at it. Finally the scrap comes away in your hand.
97522: The vine is actually a muddy color, but the leaves are broad and
streaked with bright yellow. Uncounted fine tendrils root deeply into the
mound.
97630: A single fat red pod, about the size of your fist, clings to the vine at
one point.
97703: You reach out and brush one leaf, hesitantly. The leaf wiggles. No
horrible screaming noises ensue; no carnivorous roots whip around your hand.
Just a vine.
97823: The vine is anchored by a multitude of roots.
97861: The vine has a sharp, sweetish odor. It's not very pleasant.
97913: The vine sizzles where the flame touches it, and an oily sap drips and
sparkles. But nothing else seems to happen.
98122: The pod gives ripely when you touch it. It snaps free, and a drop of
oily fluid leaks from the stem.
98432: Pmsealing the road.
98469: The road runs from the gate towards the distant forest in the south.
98546: You stroll for a while, back to the ruined chimney.
98594: You approach the base of the west pillar.
98634: You approach the base of the east pillar.
98674: The road leads south from the gate, and the massive pillars stand east
and west.
98739: Well, one stands, and -- never mind.
98802: Wide as it is, the gateway presses briefly around you with its sensation
of weighty stone; but sunlit hills are beyond.
98913: The pillar to the east still stands, but the western one tilts wildly
over your head. It leans toward its partner as if it had a secret to impart.
But bright sky slices thin between the two dark shapes.
99059: The pillar to the east still stands, but the western one lies crumpled
flat on the ground before the gate.
99134: On either side of the gate, only a few feet from the wall, stands a
massive metal pillar. Each is almost as wide as you are tall, and they reach
nearly to the top of the wall.
99281: They're old, rust-streaked. The west one lies fallen at the foot of the
gate. Its cable is broken too; it dangles loose from the top of the west
gate-track.
99399: They're old, rust-streaked. The west one leans above you, suspended by
its cable, which makes an angled line back to the top of the west gate-track.
99506: They're old, rust-streaked; the west one even has yellowish vines
wreathing the top. But they daunt you nevertheless. They clearly have something
to do with the gate, for twin cables run from the tops of the pillars to the
tops of the gate-side tracks.
99696: The pillars are a few yards to each side of the road. You'll have to
move to the east or west to reach them.
99778: The gate is a cross-planked affair of dark old wood. It's twenty feet
high at least
99877: . The edges of the gate are set onto twin metal tracks that run all the
way up this face of the wall. You can also make out cables -- glinting; metal
cables? -- which run from the top corners of the gate, up along the tracks, and
then across to the tops of the pillars.
100083: The east one, anyway.
100116: There's a gate in the way, and it's the size of a small barn.
100167: The beams of the gate are too massive to get a grip on, and the
gate-tracks are too smooth.
100240: Peering between two beams, you can see the road disappearing over a
rise to the north. Beyond that, in the distance, ivy-wound towers delicately
finger the sky.
100363: The gate is already open.
100382: With a desperate hope that nobody is watching, you brace yourself under
a beam and heave. The gate pays no attention.

You heave again. The gate
responds with a finely-honed disdain.

You give up.
100556: The gate is well out of your reach, not that your reach could do much
to it in any event.
100626: The cables run from the top corners of the gate, up along the tracks
that hold the edge-beams of the gate.
100716: At the top, the east cable stretches across a few feet of space to the
top of its column. The west cable just hangs broken.
100806: At the top, the cables stretch across to the tops of the columns. A few
feet on the east side, that; but on the west, the cable makes a long taut angle
to the top of the leaning pillar.
100939: At the top the cables stretch across a few feet of space to the tops of
the columns; but you can see nothing further from here.
101052: The cables are not within reach.
101099: The wall may be old, but its craft is astonishing. You can barely fit a
fingertip between two blocks. Climbing is out of the question.
101199: Nothing happens.
101301: dangerously against the violet sky. The road
101535: The gate is open, raised high above the road.
101571: The gate is still closed.
101600: The gate is east of here. You'll have to approach it.
101649: The cable runs from the top corner of the gate, up along the gate-track
to the top of the wall, and across to the top of the pillar that stands here.
101764: The cable runs from the top corner of the gate, up along the gate-track
to the top of the wall, and slants down to the top of the leaning pillar.
101868: The cable runs from the top corner of the gate, and up along the
gate-track to the top of the wall, where a broken end hangs loose.
101976: That is out of reach.
101999: A small hatch stands open at the pillar's base.
102042: The pillar is almost as wide as you are tall, and reaches nearly to the
top of the wall. It's badly streaked and patched with corrosion. You can even
see yellowish vines near the top, crawling down the sides and out along the
cable which runs to the gate-track.
102359: There's no way up the outside of the pillar.
102440: A terrible creaking, and the pillar sways just a bit. It must be even
more corroded than it looks. And then you hear a faint snap; followed by a
rumbling high above.
102577: The pillar stings your hands with its vibration. You draw back,
startled.
102630: You heave at the pillar; a faint sway encourages you. You lean your
full weight. It gives more... and, with a terrible howl, begins to buckle.
Rusty shards spray from the ancient metal.

The pillar, slowly, leans.
102810: You see the cable slide free of the top of the pillar, as the pillar
moves away from the gate-track. Then the pillar is shrieking its ruin down
against the blind earth.
102953: Then it is swinging around; the pillar is caught by the cable that runs
from its top to the gate-track. Below, the gate twitches. You stare as the west
corner of the gate jerks up, just a thread.

But no more. The pillar slams into
the wall with a splitting note; and the cable snaps. The pillar screams and
drops to its ruin.
103217: Then it is swinging around; the pillar is caught by the cable that runs
from its top to the gate-track. Below, the gate twitches. You stare as the west
corner of the gate jerks up, just a thread. Then the east side rises as well.
The pillar slams into the wall, and scrapes; it is still leaning.

The gate
rises, rises, as the west pillar falls. The cables whine and hum. But they
hold; and the pillar slows, approaching its mate to the east.

A final creak.
Stillness. The west pillar hangs suspended, leaning towards the east pillar
which stands still straight; nearly reaching it; not quite touching. The gate
is open.
103666: Then an elf crawls out and shoves it back upright. [BUG].
103721: The hatch isn't locked; it's just very very old.
103793: It's dim, but you can make out metal rungs leading up the inside wall.
103880: You pry at the hatch. Rust sifts down from the rim, but the hinges are
solidly corroded. You do, however, feel the entire pillar swaying and creaking
gently. It's a little disturbing.
104087: oil soaks down over the rusty hinges. It seems to evaporate almost
instantly, but a slight glistening remains which bodes well.
104183: More rust flakes down, and the hinges sound like they're grinding your
bones, but you manage to lever the hatch open.
104275: The pillar sways just a bit. It must be even more corroded than it
looks. And then you hear a faint snap, followed by a rumbling high above.
104390: Shoving the hatch to is easier -- slightly -- than opening it was.
104447: The pillar leans drunkenly to the east, suspended by its cable. The
base is twisted like dry paper.
104523: The pillar lies on the ground, here and east, flat as a foot. Its base
is twisted like dry paper.
104607: The pillar hangs astonishingly, suspended by one taut line: the cable
which angles from its top back to the top of the gate-track. The pillar is
104711: The pillar is so much rusty wreck. It's
104742: mostly torn away from its base, but the metal is crumpled around the
slab that's still inside. There's no way in.
104831: The hatch hangs loose from a distorted frame, but there's no way in.
Whatever room there was in front of the dull slab is gone now, tight with
twisted metal. The gaping tears at the base of the pillar are the same.
104992: There's no way up the outside of the pillar.
105025: It's lying on the ground.
105053: The pillar emits a muffled clunk.
105090: The pillar sways gently on its cable, and the gate creaks alarmingly.
You stop.
105147: The pillar does not move.
105173: You can make out nothing inside but more rusty shreds.
105219: The hinges are badly bent. No amount of oil will move them now.
105274: You worm your way out to sunlight.
105311: The pillar sways slightly to your movement.
105373: The hatch doesn't seem to be designed to close from the inside. This is
probably best.
105471: Better not.
105487: There's nowhere to put anything down here.
105587: You can see the wall outside, and the track that runs up it, across
from the pillar. The cable runs out one of the holes, to the top of the track,
and descends to the gate.
105715: You scratch away some of the rust, but you strike metal before the hole
gets much bigger.
105798: That's outside the pillar.
105834: The vine is actually a muddy color, but the leaves are broad and
streaked with bright yellow. Uncounted fine tendrils root deeply into the black
surface above. The vines thread in and out through the holes in the pillar.
106020: A single fat red pod clings to the vine at one point.
106064: Two fat red pods cling to the vine.
106096: Three fat red pods cling to the vine.
106167: Just a vine.
106185: The vine is anchored by a multitude of roots.
106223: The vine has a sharp, sweetish odor. It's not very pleasant.
106275: The vine sizzles where the flame touches it, and an oily sap drips and
sparkles. But nothing else seems to happen.
106495: Carefully, you pull all three pods from the vine.
106538: A large metal pulley is suspended here, on an axle that runs across the
pillar just below the ceiling. A cable runs into the pillar, around the pulley,
and descends a few feet to a frayed end.
106674: The wheel is over a yard wide; its axle, which runs east-west, is as
thick as your wrist. Both pulley and axle are as thick with rust
106813: A cable runs in from a hole to the north -- a deliberate hole, not
corrosion -- and wraps several times around the pulley. But from there it
descends only a few feet. The cable-end is frayed and ragged.
107037: oil soaks down over the pulley. It seems to evaporate almost instantly,
but the joint and axle now glisten slightly in the dim light.
107143: The pulley is rusted solidly in place.
107172: You pull back and forth on the wheel, as hard as you can without losing
your grip on the ladder. The oil has helped, but you're just not strong enough
to turn it much.
107310: The cable wraps several times around the pulley. Between the tight
loops and the long years of rust and weight, it's completely immobile. You
can't even unwrap it much. And pulling on the cable above the pulley is
hopeless; you'd be lifting the entire gate below.
107500: Pulling up on the cable with all your force, you manage to turn the
wheel about half an inch.
107573: The dangling cable-end swings gently.
107607: Maybe you want to turn the pulley?
107654: anywhere. Unless you enjoy plummeting.
107691: The cable is too stiff to tie.
107727: A dull metal slab rests on the ground in the shaft, making this an
uncomfortable squeeze. It's almost as broad as the shaft, and taller than you.
107879: Perhaps you don't understand the situation here. This thing is somewhat
taller and wider than you, and it's solid metal.
107971: There doesn't seem to be anything under the slab. Of course, if there
was anything, it would be pulverized.
108053: You pull yourself up a few rungs and look down. There's nothing behind
the slab.
108120: For all it moves, it might have grown here since sea split from sky.
108174: The surface is rather uneven.
108227: The rumbling noise rapidly grows louder.
108277: Something metallic, hard, and very, very heavy roars down from the
darkness above.
108368: within the pillar. Then -- silence, broken only a faint rattling which
rapidly dies away.
108449: You can't unmoor the cable from the slab.
108485: You can't climb something which is lying on the ground.
108531: The cable is too stiff to tie.
108562: You are at the foot of the east pillar; it and the wall lean
dangerously against the violet sky. The road
108758: The gate is west of here. You'll have to approach it.
108802: The cable runs from the top corner of the gate, up along the gate-track
to the top of the wall, and across to the top of the pillar that stands here.
108920: That is out of reach.
108975: A small hatch stands open at the pillar's base.
109018: The pillar is almost as wide as you are tall, and reaches nearly to the
top of the wall. It's somewhat streaked with corrosion. A cable runs from the
top to the top of the gate-track.
109279: There's no way up the outside of the pillar.
109379: The hatch isn't locked; it's just very very old.
109451: It's dim, but you can make out metal rungs leading up the inside wall.
109538: You pry at the hatch. Rust sifts down from the rim, but the hinges are
solidly corroded.
109677: oil soaks down over the rusty hinges. It seems to evaporate almost
instantly, but a slight glistening remains which bodes well.
109775: More rust flakes down, and the hinges sound like they're grinding your
bones, but you manage to lever the hatch open.
109866: Shoving the hatch to is easier -- slightly -- than opening it was.
109922: You worm your way out to sunlight.
109961: There's just enough room in front of the slab.
110009: As you approach the top, you find that you must squeeze around a solid
metal shape that hangs in the shaft.
110109: The hatch doesn't seem to be designed to close from the inside. This is
probably best.
110207: Better not.
110223: There's nowhere to put anything down here.
110323: You can see the wall outside, and the track that runs up it, across
from the pillar. The cable runs out one of the holes, to the top of the track,
and descends to the gate.
110462: That's outside the pillar.
110490: A large metal pulley is suspended here, on an axle that runs across the
pillar just below the ceiling. A cable runs into the pillar, around the pulley,
and descends
110682: The wheel is over a yard wide; its axle, which runs east-west, is as
thick as your wrist. Both pulley and axle are as thick with rust
110821: A cable runs in from a hole to the north and wraps several times around
the pulley. From there
111037: oil soaks down over the pulley. It seems to evaporate almost instantly,
but the joint and axle now glisten slightly in the dim light.
111143: The pulley is rusted solidly in place.
111172: You pull back and forth on the wheel, as hard as you can without losing
your grip on the ladder. Nothing happens. Your oil may have done its work, but
there's still a huge slab of metal on the end of the cable and an even larger
gate on the other.
111451: The cable is wrapped several times around the great pulley; and from
there, it leaves the pillar through a small gap to the north. Outside, you can
see that the cable runs across a yard of empty space to the top of the stone
wall. There it passes into the metal track which descends this face of the
wall.
111673: The cable wraps several times around the pulley, and it's stone-taut
both above and below.
111769: Maybe you want to turn the pulley?
111799: You grab the cable. A few seconds of sliding and a bit of rope-burn
brings you to the slab. It barely shifts under your weight. And standing here
doesn't seem to be very exciting; so you swing over to the ladder and descend
the rest of the way.
111986: The cable is too stiff to tie.
112027: A dull metal slab hangs in the shaft, just above your head.
112074: It's a thick block, not perfectly rectangular; the edges are a bit
lumpy. The dim light brings out hints of hammer marks in the surface. The slab
is nearly as wide as the shaft, although there's room to climb around it.
112236: Spliced to the top is a metal cable which runs up to the pulley.
112295: Perhaps you don't understand the situation here. This thing is somewhat
taller and wider than you, and it's solid metal.
112387: There's nothing below the slab.
112417: There's nothing behind the slab.
112450: You give the slab a shove, and it swings by a fraction of an inch.
112502: The surface is rather uneven.
112551: The slab hangs far below, a black shape against the light spilling in
through the hatch.
112617: You can barely make out a black shape hanging far above you.
112677: The slab is far below you.
112772: The air here is cool and slightly damp, traced with rust, and very
still.
112847: The rungs are fixed in place, which is quite reassuring.
112893: The rungs are immobile.
113122: You duck, quite unnecessarily, as you pass under the massive hanging
gate.
113208: The towers are far to the north, beyond the rise.
113274: The magenta lake resolves into a broad growth of lichen that spreads
raggedly around the dome.
113354: You pull on a pipe, and a few others shift and clank. But the whole
pile is laxly bound together, and much too heavy to move.
113450: There's nothing much under the pile but rust-stained earth. You do
notice that a few of the cables are anchored in the ground.
113546: You crawl onto the middle of the pile. Nothing new is apparent, but for
an uneasy rolling scrape beneath you, so you carefully scramble out.
113656: The castle is far to the north.
113688: The dome is far to the northwest.
113738: The road curves north as it circles the castle.
113778: The road curves north as it circles the castle.
113890: The trench is at least thirty feet deep, and the same in width. It
stretches right to the castle's base; the close-fitted stone blocks that line
the far wall of the moat run right up into the castle wall. The moat's bottom
is lined with long plates of iron, jagged and rusty, and foul water trickles
past.
114117: You can also see some pipes and cables down there, lying scattered
across the iron plates.
114191: Decay and old damp rust breathe up from the depths.
114309: Hardly.
114375: You would die.
114395: You lean, carefully -- the near wall is as smoothly masoned as the
other. You would certainly slip and fall, to the waiting metal teeth.
114498: The castle rears into the sky, immense yet still graceful. Ivy vines
entwine it even more thickly than you saw from a distance; green runs up the
towers and dangles into the moat, and the ivory-white stone peeks out in ten
thousand fringed gaps.
114674: A gate lies open on this side of the castle.
114710: A balcony curves from this side of the castle, above.
114760: The castle is on the far side of the moat.
114800: The iron is at the bottom of the trench, and you have no desire to
climb down.
114897: You grapple the vines -- they sag abominably -- and pull yourself up.
For a few yards you manage; but the ivy becomes more unstable as you ascend.
Finally you drop back down, wondering irritably who could have arranged for the
vines to be at once too heavy to break and too flimsy to climb.
115109: The vines are too tough.
115133: The vines are tasteless.
115157: The vines have no scent.
115183: A bit of green fiber sizzles, but the vines are too sap-rich to burn.
115242: The vines are firmly anchored.
115272: The space within the castle seems to be entirely choked with vines, as
well.
115411: You already are over the trench.
115443: There's no way down from here. In fact, from this vantage, you can
easily see that there's no way down anywhere.
115536: The iron is at the bottom of the trench.
115570: The road curves west as it circles the castle.
115631: A plain brass lever juts up by the moat.
115665: A loose pile of pipes and cable lies scattered at the bottom of the
moat. There's also a plain brass lever nearby.
115757: The pipes are of various lengths, most longer than your body, though no
thicker than your wrist. The metal cables run in and out of their open ends.
Everything is heavily stained with mud and rust; and the iron plates have taken
their pay, for several pipes are bent or split, and most of the cables seem to
be broken.
116000: The pipes and cables are at the bottom of the trench, out of reach.
116055: The lever clunks (with a bit of a rattle), and springs back.
116105: The lever won't push.
116186: The road curves east as it circles the castle.
116233: There is no way across the moat here.
116266: Patches of magenta lichen gradually crowd out the meadow-grass.
116347: Pa QpmYou step gingerly onto the bridge. For all its delicacy, it
barely sways, and you climb easily across the gaping moat.
116441: You climb across the delicate span.
116487: A neat stack of pipes and cable sits by the edge of the trench. Close
by, a plain brass lever juts from the stonework.
116573: An airy web of pipes and cables arches neatly over the moat, touching
the balcony. The lever juts from the stonework near its base.
116679: The pipes are of various lengths; they're arranged in a tapering
hexagonal stack, wider than you are tall but only half your height. Metal
cables run in and out of their open ends, forming a symmetrical web within the
stack.
116839: The pile has extended itself into a slim, fragile-looking arch over the
moat. The pipes hang in an astonishing tapering helix -- no two touch, in fact,
but the cables that run between their ends bind them into integrity.
117010: The pipes are firmly bound together, and barely shift under your full
weight.
117077: There's nothing much under the pile. You do notice that a few of the
cables are anchored in the ground.
117153: The web arches over the moat.
117199: You crawl up to the middle of the pile. Nothing new is apparent, and
the interior of the pile is too heavily cable-crossed to enter, so you scramble
back down.
117341: The lever clunks solidly, and springs back.
117379: The lever clunks solidly, and springs back. You hear a faint hum from
somewhere below, but it fades quickly.
117461: The lever clunks solidly, and springs back. You hear a hum from
somewhere below; the pile of pipes bounces for a moment, and the cables jerk
taut. But then the sound fades and the pile settles.
117603: The lever clunks solidly, and springs back. A loud hum begins
117947: ; the web-bridge begins to relax, and draw back from the balcony. In
moments it has collapsed back to a simple pile of pipes.
118080: The lever won't push.
118170: You step up on the bridge, and pass over the moat.
118260: A deep sinister voice chuckles, "Nightmare."
118303: The tiles are smooth, just a bit worn.
118337: Nothing shifts.
118354: An airy web of pipes and cables arches neatly over the moat, just
touching the balcony, casting a pool of shadow across the mosaic tiles.
118450: It's a slim, fragile-looking arch over the moat. The pipes hang in an
astonishing tapering helix -- no two touch, in fact, but the cables that run
between their ends bind them into integrity. The bridge's shadow is peculiarly
solid.
118626: The pipes are firmly bound together. The arch sways a bit, being
anchored only at the far end, but nothing worse.
118759: You reach into the shadow, and in, in, and the farther you stretch the
farther there is to go -- you pull back, shivering -- from more than nerves;
the shadow is aching, iron cold.
118895: You smell a hint of ice-bitten chill.
118931: The shadow falls across your hand like winter wind.
119206: The dome is far to the southwest.
119240: The meadows lie beyond the moat.
119322: The lichen gives way to more normal meadow weeds as you approach the
castle.
119386: The lichen gives way to more normal meadow weeds as you approach the
intersection.
119467: You pause for a moment, as sun-dazzle fades from the dim interior.
119529: You can't tear even a bit of the moss off the mat.
119571: The moss has just a trace of spicy scent, particularly where you've
walked.
119633: Eating unknown plants seems like a bad idea.
119671: There doesn't seem to be anything there but dirt.
119721: A few drops of sour-stinking sap ooze out. You hurriedly wipe your
fingers clean.
119787: You tug on a bit of the lichen, but it doesn't come free. It does ooze
a bit of sour-stinking sap, which you hurriedly wipe off your fingers.
119895: A puff of truly foul smoke arises. Fortunately, the fire smoulders and
dies almost immediately.
119971: The lichen has a terribly, terribly sour reek. You're not even slightly
tempted to taste it.
120057: You can't see anything in the lichen.
120095: The lichen is rough. It's also warm -- warmer than you'd expect, even
in sunlight.
120167: You search through the moss for a moment, but nothing turns up.
120230: The castle is off to the northeast.
120263: The slope is not steep, even at the base, but the dome's surface is so
smooth that you cannot get a grip.
120345: The dome thumps hollowly, but the polished grey curve shows no damage.
120401: The dome is very smooth, a glossy grey-brown. You'd think it was wood,
except that you cannot feel a grain to it, though it's not perfectly even
either.
120514: This dim space curves to fill the east edge of the dome. The only light
comes from the bright archway to the east. The west wall curves as well, but
toward you, obviously outlining a chamber in the dome's center; a
120758: A pull-cord hangs above a tiled depression by the eastern exit; several
potted plants sit in corners of the chamber, but broad patches of the magenta
lichen show that this place has gone long untended.
120906: The bright violet sky glares, and you blink painfully for a moment.
121006: The hatchway is blocked by a tumultuous magenta mass.
121067: You can hear a faint hum, from somewhere below.
121122: Exn
A subliminal hum is coming from somewhere in the dome.
121250: The depression is a handspan deep, and a few feet wide. It's lined with
white tile, sides and bottom -- free of lichen, too, you note. The pull-cord
hangs by the depression's edge
121458: You step out of the depression.
121495: The white tiles have the faintest shadow of an odor... something dry
and prickly, however that smells.
121623: You step down onto the tiles.
121655: The bob swings gently.
121703: You yank on the cord, which refuses to come loose.
121777: There is a grating click. After a moment, something groans breathily
overhead.
121839: There is a grating click, and a fading wheeze from overhead.
121890: There is a grating click, but nothing else happens.
121932: The cord grates and jams at its lowest extension.
121977: You can't pull it any farther.
122010: There are several swathes of the magenta lichen spread about; most of
the floor is covered. You notice that the areas around the potted plants are
nearly bare, though.
122143: On the other hand, the space beyond the hatch is solidly packed with
crusted magenta matter.
122223: The lichen is rough. It's also surprisingly warm, in this dim chamber.
122282: It's a tall oval in the convex west wall, rimmed with heavy steel.
122336: The hatch cover is closed.
122365: The hatch stands open, but the opening is choked with huge clumps of
brilliant lichen.
122429: The hatch stands open.
122470: You can't reach the hatch from where you're standing.
122519: You set your feet and pull. Dust sifts down from the rim as you haul
the hatch cover open.
122589: But the space beyond is entirely filled with masses of magenta lichen.
Hmm.
122651: The hatch swings to, moaning.
122714: Avoiding the cloud, you reach for the plant once again. It snaps free
easily. But almost immediately, the flower begins to droop, and shed its
hair-fine petals. You are left holding a limp stem.
122858: There's no need to start a collection, especially of specimens which
succumb so easily.
122927: Best not to eat strange plants.
122955: Blue ceramic pots.
122998: An icy, herbal odor fills your head, and pours coolly down into your
lungs.
123087: A cloud of vapor jets from the flower, in the instant that you touch
it. You jerk back, but you still catch a whiff of herbal scent which chills
your throat.
123207: Dirt and plants.
123228: The pots are too large to move.
123263: You can't see anything through the keyhole.
123319: The stem has no odor.
123362: You're more like to catch a shadow in a rabbit-snare.
123406: Unsurprisingly, you feel nothing.
123444: You lean into the cloud. The chill herbal scent drowns you, an icy
blast which sweeps your senses aside. You shake your head, trying to clear it.
Even the light seems ice-blue.
123626: You are in a room which is round, high, and nearly empty. An open hatch
leads east.
123751: You can hear a faint hum, from somewhere below.
123807: There is a warm flush on your skin, somehow unpleasant.
123919: The hatch opens into the outer room; you can't reach the cover from
here.
124130: A circular bar hangs high above; you can make out little detail.
124231: The room seems brighter.
124262: The room is definitely brighter.
124297: The ring overhead burns with a stark white light. A faint hum has
begun, somewhere below you.

The red stuff is growing visibly now, like thick
blood boiling up.
124437: The room is much dimmer now.
124470: The room dims.
124493: The light from the ring fades somewhat.

The tide of lichen slows.

The
humming is no longer audible.
124572: The ring is far above your reach.
124755: You notice that lichen has silently clogged the west hatchway.
124840: You feel a faint, feverish prickling on your skin.
124892: There is a prickling flush of pain in your blood.
124944: Your bones ache, and you feel vaguely ill.
124992: You are feverish. Your stomach hurts, now.
125035: Everything blurs suddenly; you cannot focus. The fever sings fire, and
the taste of blood --
125127: You notice faint reddish stains on the floor, by your feet. In fact,
the patches seem to be shaped like your footprints.
125237: The reddish patches are growing, and darkening. They seem slightly
rough.
125315: The patches are spreading across the floor; crusted, thick magenta
growth.
125393: The floor is blanketed with heavy magenta tufts, except for a small
bare patch around the blocks. Fingers of lichen pluck at your ankles.
125665: You stagger, trying to keep your feet in the heaving, rustling magenta
sea.
125755: Your skin still prickles unnervingly.
125802: Your flesh still aches, and you are momentarily dizzy.
125861: Your blood and bones burn with unseen fire. A wave of nausea buffets
you.
126010: The vapor begins to disperse.
126038: The cloud of vapor has dissipated.
126086: The herbal aroma clings in your lungs, cool and powerful.
126141: The icy, herbal aroma still lingers in the back of your throat.
126198: The icy scent is fading from your palate.
126239: You can no longer taste the herbal odor.
126288: touching. They scream "Yeugh, block cooties!" [BUG]
126403: ausfpm is not large. The surface is dull, though it seems worked with
great precision; the edges are right and the faces perfectly smooth. The blocks
are
126528: ausfpm doesn't lift. You heave again. It barely stirs. This clearly
isn't going to work.
126626: The blocks aren't really big enough to balance on.
126668: Nothing obvious happens.
126716: aupfpm into contact with its mate. The light overhead blazes unbearably
-- and there is a flare of heat on your face.

You back away, but fever burns
in your bones; even the lichen is blistering. Then everything dims, even as
white-hot metal drips across the floor, somewhere distant....
126953: The position is awkward; you are leaning practically flat and
scrabbling your toes on the floor for purchase. But you manage to shift
127145: Look, this isn't going to get any more exciting.
127210: You brace your hands, set your heels, and haul. You look astonishingly
stupid, leaning far over backwards with your weight set against a small chunk
of metal; but you manage to shift
127426: In the center of the floor are two identical blocks of dull metal, each
about the size of your head.
127896: You can hear a faint hum, from somewhere below.
127956: A subliminal hum is coming from somewhere below.
128033: The pod gives ripely when you press it, and a trace of oily fluid leaks
out.
128093: The pod has a powerful, sweet-acrid odor. It stings your eyes.
128145: You gingerly lick the trace of fluid on the pod's surface -- and spit.
It's awful; a bitter oily flavor that burns your tongue.
128245: You bite into the pod tentatively.
128278: opm

How nasty! The whole thing just collapsed; it was only a tight
skin over fluid. And the fluid, of course, spurted all over your face, filling
your mouth with a bitter, oily burning. You spit and sputter furiously,
scrubbing at your face and clothing. The fluid evaporates with an unnaturally
rapid chill. You're just glad you didn't swallow any, or get it in your eyes.
128599: oxn

Flaming oil spurts heavily. Much of it falls on you, and your
clothing. There is nothing after that but red screaming and, eventually, shock.
128741: The pod ruptures easily, drenching your hand with an oily fluid. It
evaporates with an unnaturally rapid chill, leaving nothing but an acrid odor,
and a few scraps of reddish skin, which you shake from your fingers.
128903: The east pillar is a few yards off the road. You'll have to approach it
to do anything.
128980: The west pillar lies fallen at the foot of the gate. Its cable is
broken too; it dangles loose from the top of the west gate-track.
129078: The west pillar leans crazily. It's suspended by its cable, which makes
an angled line back to the top of the west gate-track.
129169: The west pillar stands nearly as high as the wall, rusty but still
firm. You can make out a cable running from its top to the top of the west
gate-track.
129297: You'll have to approach it to do anything.
129333: The west pillar hangs just out of your reach. You'll have to approach
its base.
129397: The west pillar is a few yards off the road. You'll have to approach it
to do anything.
129471: It's much too tough to eat, but you take a lick.
129520: The blue material has no taste other than the dirt worn into it.
129570: The blue material has no odor.
129607: You search through the weeds for a moment, but nothing turns up.
129661: You yank a weed; but your unbotanical eye hasn't the look of it, and
you toss it aside. The moss is more tenacious. You can't tear even a bit of it
off the mat.
129783: The roadside plants have no particular odor, but the moss has just a
trace of spicy scent, particularly where you've walked.
129877: Eating unknown plants seems like a bad idea.
129915: There doesn't seem to be anything there but dirt.
130140: ausfpm impales you with icy eyes. You freeze; but
130326: ausfpm holds your eyes impassively for a moment. Then your gaze drops.
130415: head in disgust. Before you can move, the two of them have pinioned
your arms, and you find yourself rapidly elsewhere.
130893: In less than an hour, you are in an uncomfortably official-looking
room, facing several official-looking people in blue and yellow robes. They
offer you a beaker of something murky. Something in the way they stare tells
you that drinking it would be less painful than refusing it. The world goes
murky as well.

If it's any comfort, the officials looked horrified when you
collapsed. There must be something different about your metabolism.
131213: The resonance of your voice and the box spread out into the quiet...
and people turn, and you see the light in their eyes.

And the fury --

The
crowd knots, a surge of clawing, kicking, smashing, with you at the center. In
the brief moments of pain, you still manage to be surprised at the utter
silence of the mob.
131480: You pull yourself up the ladder.
131513: No heads turn.
131538: The rolls are each fifteen or twenty feet long, and do you know how
heavy canvas is?
131602: You peer narrowly into a roll. There is nothing but dust there.
131654: There doesn't seem to be anything under the stack of canvas rolls.
131713: The gate is barred from the other side.
131799: The gate is closed and barred.
131829: Peering between the boards, you can make out tree-lined fields to the
north. A road runs by the fence to the south, and to the east are the anonymous
backs of brick buildings.
131957: If you had to guess, you'd guess that this fence was built to
discourage climbing. Well-built, then.
132034: The platform is just high weathered boards on this side, running all
along the west side of the field.
132113: Atop, you can see the backs of people's heads; they are intent on
something on the other side.
132182: A ladder runs up one corner-post.
132239: You see only dusty bare earth.
132267: You cannot see past the platform.
132303: The hay holds a moist warmth.
132331: It smells, wonderfully, just like hay. The shadow behind the bales adds
its own touch of spicy autumn breeze.
132415: There doesn't seem to be anything under the stack of hay bales.
132465: One might as well search for a reed in a haystack.
132509: The bales of hay are too large to move.
132548: There's no need to start a collection.
132585: You pull a wisp of hay from one bale.
132632: There's quite a lot of hay there. It would probably all catch fire, and
the results would be unpleasant.
132719: It smells of smoky autumn, no more in place here than it was in the
death-hot theater.
132884: in the way you are coming almost to understand. Again the blackness
falls upon you, and your thoughts, scattering and wearing them down into their
own ends --
133059: The wisp of hay flares up, and crumbles to white ash.
133110: It doesn't make much difference in what you hear, and it won't stay in,
and it would be miserably itchy if it did.
133194: The platform sweeps gently down to the west, in a series of low, wide,
sunny steps.
133262: And the steps are filled with people. Quiet people; they sit and gaze
intently out to the west.
133333: A long oval of earth is spread out below you in that direction. Clearly
this is a cyclia of some kind. The platform is mostly fenced, but a broad path
leads southwest, and a ladder drops down the east side.
133489: You let your eyes wander east, and let your body absently follow, until
you reach the ladder. Unnoticed, you descend.
133610: You make your way down the steps.
133647: People squint disgustedly at you, until you stop trying.
133690: The arena is a long, scarred oval of bare earth. It stretches along the
west side of the platform, although you are separated by a low railing. You can
see a gate in the south side of the arena.
133860: A fence stands between you and the arena.
133925: A few people in nondescript clothing are cleaning the arena.
133986: The arena is filled with animals; strange animals. You can't quite make
out details, but the quick darting movements are nothing you have seen before,
not in anything larger than a sparrow. These creatures are taller than you:
four legs, but some rearing to walk on two, shaggy hair -- or something, in
rich earth-toned stripes -- narrow heads with long toothy muzzles -- or beaks?
You give up; you're too far away. But the animals move with practiced
precision. They are led and ridden by people in brilliant colors, reds and
violets and greens.
134375: The arena is empty.
134400: A fence stands between you and the arena.
134878: You see hands waving up on the platform. The hands sparkle bright
silver, too bright to make out the cause.
135006: You can see the people on the platform have risen to their feet, waving
their sparkling hands madly.
135078: Exn
The hands on the platform continue to wave and glitter.
135128: The people up on the platform seem to be getting up and leaving.
135180: You see motion up on the platform -- people, though they're facing the
other way.
135263: Without warning, the door to the south slams open, and a torrent of
stomping, snorting, snapping animals pours through the building.
135363: You find yourself flattened against one wall, desperately trying to
retract your toes.
135514: . With one hand.
135534: The two clawed animals seem to have been swept away in the flood.
135597: You notice a man looking angrily around the building. He stalks out,
leaving
135682: You notice a man looking angrily around the building. He stalks out,
leaving
135760: yhn
The cavalcade of creatures ends abruptly; one last scurrying thing
vanishes through the northern door. The door to the south whaps shut, leaving a
thunderous silence.
135886: Without warning, a torrent of stomping, snorting, snapping animals
pours into the building from the north, funnelling into the southern door. You
find yourself flattened against one wall, desperately trying to retract your
toes.
136071: You notice that two large animals with evil-looking claws have just
been tethered here -- a small diversion from the flood.
136166: The cavalcade of creatures ends abruptly; one last scurrying thing
vanishes through the southern door. It whaps shut, leaving a thunderous
silence.
136297: The yard empties as the last of the crowd leaves to the northeast.
136351: Two men, one in yellow and one in blue, enter from the east. Without
speaking, they nod formally to each other, and then pull open the large gate to
the north. They take up position at either side of the gate, waiting... and
then a stream of animals and people pours across the yard, from the south
building, through the gate.
136607: A very large man in a brightly-striped tunic lifts you off the crested
animal. With one hand.
136683: You notice someone examining the crested animal's tether. She puzzles
for a moment, then shrugs and leads it to join the procession.
136783: A woman in bright checkered cloth untethers the crested animal, and
they join the procession.
136902: People and strange animals begin filing out of the gate. They stream
through the yard, into the building to the south.
137000: You notice one creature hooting distressedly, balking at the southern
doorway. After a moment, its trainer shakes her head and tethers it to a post
in the yard.
137121: The last few animals dart through the northern gate, and are led to the
south. The men in blue and yellow nod formally to each other, slide the gate
shut, nod again, and vanish still silent through the arch.
137273: People are walking down from the platform, and moving through the arch,
and away.
137337: The yard empties as the last of the crowd leaves to the east.
137381: kjzak ohn
Three people in dull clothing enter from the arch. They drag
open the northern gate, and disappear through it.
137471: Three people in nondescript clothing come through the gate, pulling it
shut behind them. They walk away to the east without a word or glance.
137621: More people are entering the yard, and crowding up the platform to the
northeast.
137702: The gate to the south scrapes open suddenly. Two irritated faces look
in at you; then their owners, a pair of men in blue and yellow, trot in and
grab you unceremoniously by the arms.

You are hauled out and dumped in the
yard, as a stream of animals and people rushes past you into the arena. The two
men take up position on either side of the gate, staring deliberately past you.
137984: The gate suddenly opens, and three people in dull clothing enter.
138084: The three people reach the north end of the arena, and begin making
their way back, sweeping industriously.
138166: The three people have swept and cleaned their way back to the south end
of the arena. Without even glancing at you, they walk out through the gate, and
heave it shut. You stare at their tracks, slightly too astonished to be angry.
138351: Animals are filing into the arena, led by people in bright colors.
138449: The circle of animals splits and doubles back, smoothly.
138497: The arena is a complex weave of animals and people, circling and
interlocking.

The people sitting here are waving their hands silently in the
air. Tiny silver chains swing and glitter on their fingers.
138645: The arena begins to separate out again, into a circle of
precisely-stepping animals and people.

The crowd around you is still quietly
waving their bright finger chains in the sunlight.
138781: Most of the animals file out of the arena. A few move to the center and
kneel placidly.
138849: In one simultaneous leap, people in brightly-colored clothing mount the
animals in the center of the arena.
138931: In the arena, the animals rear up and begin marching around, upright,
their riders still clinging firmly.
139013: In the arena, the animals leap back and forth in formation. Their
riders are waving their hands in the air.

The people sitting here are waving
back. Tiny silver chains swing and glitter on their fingers.
139165: One animal stops suddenly and lies down in the center of the arena. The
others leap over it, one after another.

The crowd around you wave its hands
harder, but the only sound is the faint scratching of claws in the arena.
139327: Two animals are lying in the arena, with the rest leaping over both of
them. Then two, and now three; the leaps grow longer.

The people around you
wave their chains harder.
139459: Four animals are crouched side by side in the center of the arena. The
other two, still carrying their proud riders, leap back and forth madly. Their
harnesses, green and violet, blur against the dusty air.

The people sitting
here have their hands upraised, waving wildly. The small bright chains on their
hands are like a waterfall of sunlight across the platform.
139723: Four animals are crouched side by side in the center of the arena. The
other two, one in green harness and one in violet, face each other across the
line.

The riders lean forward, and the two creatures hurl toward each other.
They leap simultaneously, and the animal in green hurtles over the crouching
four -- and the one in violet, incredibly, sails over all five, clearing the
green's head even at the peak of its leap.

Everyone is on their feet, utterly
silent, waving silver chains.
140125: The audience hesitates for a moment; they look a little disappointed.
140185: The animals, weaving in complex patterns, are leaving the arena through
its south gate.

The audience continues to wave the bright chains on their
fingers.
140301: The last animals file out of the arena, followed by the
brightly-clothed people.
140365: The people here on the platform begin to get up and leave. They are
still quiet, although now they are gesturing and looking at each other
animatedly.
140477: The last few people leave to the southwest.
140621: People are wandering up to the platform, and sitting down. They seem
excited, looking around and smiling, but they're strangely quiet.
140725: The platform is now crowded with people. Slowly they stop looking at
each other, and begin watching the arena below.
140810: The people sitting on the steps look about like people. The clothes are
a little strange, with long archaic-looking folded sleeves. But by far the
oddest thing is that everyone is quiet. They look at each other, smile, move
their hands, nod; but nobody speaks. You notice also that most of the crowd are
wearing rings on both hands.
141052: Small silver chains dangle from the rings, and glitter as they move.
141104: Small silver chains wrap loosely around their hands.
141178: The crowd is absolutely quiet, except for rustling of clothing and
jewelry.
141279: The people around you turn, in utter shock and horror.
141335: The people around you turn to you again. Their faces are flushed, their
eyes narrow. Then, as one, they all turn away and fix their eyes on the arena.
141442: People quiver slightly, but resolutely ignore you.
141505: Everyone's attention is on the arena to the west.
141761: ehn wave your hands in the air. People look at you oddly.
141810: Trying not to stare too blatantly, you examine the nearest person's
rings. They're plain silver bands, one on each forefinger. Each ring has a
short silver chain
142032: Those belong to the people sitting here.
142066: A short man of medium age, wearing blue, is sitting on the steps
nearby. He's not watching you obtrusively; but his attention never gets too far
away.
142178: He's short and a little heavy, with greying hair; his face is rough,
wrinkled around the eyes. He's wearing
142339: A short, middle-aged man wearing blue silk is climbing towards you. He
moves heavily, like an animate menhir. Without a word, he sits down a few rows
behind you and to one side, and begins staring absently out over the arena.
142517: The short man in blue gets up, nods curtly to you, and stumps away down
the steps.
142587: The wiry woman follows him silently.
142642: A thin, wiry young woman wearing yellow silk is standing here, watching
you.
142706: She's of medium height, thin -- not muscular, but obviously stronger
than you. She's wearing
142836: arafpn
A thin woman wearing yellow silk appears. She is watching you
coldly.
142898: This broad yard is the center of the compound, if the worn and
cross-tracked earth is any sign. A road runs east under a brick arch; a path
leads northeast to the seating platform;
143157: The west building's door is closed, and the south door is open.
143207: Both buildings' doors are closed.
143272: The gate is closed.
143301: The men in blue and yellow step together, in unison, blocking your way.
They say nothing. You retreat nevertheless.
143399: You're not agile enough for the smooth brick.
143440: People crowd a sunny avenue beyond the arch.
143482: A gate, of heavy logs, wide enough for a road to pass through. The gate
is
143575: The gate is too heavy for one person to move.
143613: You can't.
143631: Beyond the gate is a broad oval of bare earth.
143682: It's a plain building, one story, with a wide high door and narrow
windows.
143760: The door is closed.
143864: ohn -- and a pair of huge unsettling eyes stare back. You jump, and the
eyes vanish without ever having blinked.
143979: The only response is a brief rustling.
144008: There is no response.
144051: You can't reach the door from where the creature is standing.
144123: You can't reach the door from where the creature is standing.
144179: You can't, not with this stampede blasting through.
144231: You haul the door open.
144255: You drag the door shut.
144282: It's a plain building, one story, with a wide high door and narrow
windows.
144360: The door is closed.
144391: The door to the west building seems to be locked, although you can't
see any lock mechanism.
144489: You squint into the dimness beyond a window -- and something sharp
snaps at your face. You jump back.
144567: The only response is a disturbingly light tenor hooting.
144775: A length of orange leather is draped unevenly across the creature's
back.
144834: It's as strange as any creature you've seen in this place. The creature
has four slender legs, deer-like, with small three-toed feet. Its head is long
and tapered, with huge eyes set wide and high up the skull, and a short broad
bill at the end of the muzzle. A gentle, slightly goofy face. Most of the body
has a fine tan plush coat, lightening to cream on the belly; but this thickens
to a tufty black mane up the neck and across the forehead. And from the top of
the mane, reaching back from the top of the skull, an absurd bone crest hooks
back, a knobby curve at least as long as the head itself.
145262: The creature is tied to a post with a long tether, which is looped
around its neck.
145324: A tether is looped around the creature's neck; the cut end dangles on
the ground.
145392: A length of orange leather is draped unevenly across its back.
145457: The creature looks at you sideways. Its eyes are large and dark and
liquid, but not particularly bright-looking.
145543: Complex puns about animal husbandry come to mind.
145608: The creature shivers, but does not slow.
145642: The creature stiffens, and shivers, but does not move. Once was
apparently enough.
145706: The creature shies from your approach. Once was apparently enough.
145810: . It shies violently
145903: creature tries to leap again, and staggers; then it seems to calm. It
shakes its crested head, hoots a few times, and looks around for some grass.
146073: The clatter of its claws fades rapidly.
146117: The creature bills up the hay, and chews placidly.
146154: The creature doesn't show much interest.
146237: You slide from the careening creature's back. There is a painful
interval of hooves and cobblestones, and then you are lying on your bruises
146382: .

The creature bounds towards the river, and for a moment it seems
about to leap -- but then its claws are skittering on the cobblestones,
scrambling to a stop. It looks around nervously, then begins billing at a tuft
of grass by the river.
146553: You slide off the crested creature. It gives you a sidelong stare and
goes back to cropping grass.
146640: You can't drape the leather on the animal's back when you're sitting
there.
146695: It would just fall off onto the ground.
146735: It's hard enough staying on.
146790: The creature sidles away from you, with a nervous glance.
146831: The creature's short fur ruffles pleasantly. It gives a low hoot, and
pokes your arm gently with its bill. A friendly scene, all around.
146935: The creature has a musty, slightly sour odor.
146973: The creature is male. Did you really care?
147014: The creature takes an obliging step, albeit in an arbitrary direction.
147072: What a nasty thought. Bite your tongue.
147184: You cling to the creature's mane as it gallops furiously.
147238: Your mount is in a blind gallop.
147266: Your mount is blissfully oblivious to your desires.
147319: It's wearing the orange leather, but that's all.
147356: You find nothing unusual.
147406: You drape the leather over the animal's back. It wrinkles and hangs
awkwardly, but it stays on.
147537: You can't take the leather; you're sitting on it.
147607: The creature whuffles a bit as you slide onto its back, but it seems
able to carry you.
147679: The creature runs away without you, humming "The Liberty Bell." [BUG]
147811: arafpm
The creature jerks its head abruptly. It sees the river ahead.
For one instant you feel it bunch up, as if to leap -- but then its claws are
skittering on the cobbles, scrambling to a stop. Your knotted fingers stop
protesting and simply give up; you slide over the creature's shoulder, flop to
the pavement. The stone pavement.

A moment later you look up, and see it
unconcernedly billing at some grass by the river's margin. There's no justice.
148443: The crested animal chews thoughtfully.
148492: The crested animal crops some grass by the river's edge.
148584: The crested animal chews thoughtfully.
148618: It's a long line of tanned black leather, which shows an irregular
diamond pattern. The tether is tied around the crested creature's neck at one
end
148806: The knots are pulled too tight. You can't get anywhere with them.
148858: The creature hoots in vague irritation, twitches its head, and yanks
the tether out of your hands.
148938: It's quite tied enough already.
148966: There must be more to this animal-training stuff than you thought. You
can't get a knot to stay firm.
149045: The crested animal grunts in protest.
149079: The tanned leather won't burn.
149143: A few moments of determined sawing, and the tether dangles free.
149195: The remaining length of leather won't snap.
149231: The leather won't snap.
149264: The crested creature is too far ahead.
149298: They look about like people. The clothes are a little strange, with
long archaic-looking folded sleeves. But by far the oddest thing is that
everyone is quiet. They look at each other, smile, move their hands, nod; but
nobody speaks. You notice also that most of the crowd are wearing rings on both
hands. Small silver chains wrap loosely around their hands.
149599: The crowd is absolutely quiet, except for rustling of clothing and
movement.
149661: The people around you turn, in utter shock and horror.
149729: Nobody pays much attention.
149863: Two men flank the open gate. The tall one is wearing blue silk and the
fat one yellow, in identical styles; but you'd guessed they have some formal
function just from the way they stand.
150002: He's very tall, much taller than you, and bonily thin. His hair is lank
white over a thin, emotionless face. He's wearing
150210: He's terribly overweight, and he looks like he was large-boned to begin
with. Even in this mild air, his face is moist. He's wearing baggy
150386: You stand in a long arena of soft, dry earth. The ground is scarred
with tracks, both of claws and hooves and booted feet; a musty smell rises
around you, but the arena is quiet and still. A railing surrounds you, with a
wide gate to the south, which lies
150599: The gate is closed.
150614: You silently slip through the gate.
150699: Beyond the gate is the dusty yard.
150738: Unappetizing and unimportant.
150767: You notice a length of brighter color, something orange, lying along
the edge of the arena.
150866: It seems to be a crumpled length of heavy leather, fairly long, six
feet or more. Its shape is odd, a rough diamond with straps and loops hanging
off of it here and there. Dust, sun, and rain have faded it terribly; but it
must have been garish orange, once.
151055: You try wrapping the leather around yourself, but it doesn't work very
well. It's much too wide for a sash or belt, at least in the middle. You could
heave it across your back as a sort of half-cape, but the tapering ends don't
even slightly work as sleeves. And the whole thing is really too stiff to be
clothing. You give up.
151291: The leather is faded as well as dirty. You rub the worst of the dust
off, but it doesn't make much difference.
151375: Heavy leather that's been lying in the dirt for weeks at least?
151425: It smells of warm dirt and dung, with an underlying thread of something
acridly unfamiliar.
151562: You can't do that while you're sitting on it.
151597: The orange leather hangs awkwardly on the crested animal, and you can't
quite rearrange it so that the ends meet around its belly, much less tie them
together.
151730: You can't do that while you're sitting on it.
151765: The tapered ends of the leather do look exactly long enough to meet
beneath the creature's belly, and there are straps that might fasten together
there. Also beneath the creature's belly are two powerful legs and many large
hindclaws. The leather really looks like it's settled snugly enough, you
decide.
151976: You puzzle over the various straps that are attached to the orange
leather; but there aren't any parts that obviously tie together.
152124: You pick it up, and try to shake it out. It's a crumpled length of
heavy leather, at least six feet long, and oddly shaped.
152218: Three people are working here, sweeping and cleaning the ground, and
gathering scraps and trash. They move methodically and don't seem to notice you
at all.
152408: . The wide door to the north is closed.
152482: in the south wall. This room is divided by several low partitions; the
sections are open to each other, and floored with soft earth.
152593: The wide door is closed.
152635: The door is filled with people and big heavy animals. You can't get
through.
152701: The air here has a musty, acrid smell.
152743: The wide door is open.
152763: The wide door is closed.
152891: The creatures shift restlessly.
152914: There is no response.
152938: It's smaller than the north door, but not by much. The door is
153092: It seems to be locked, although you can't see any way to unlock it.
153152: People and animals are still passing through the door.
153199: You can't see any way to lock or unlock it.
153242: The door is filled with people and big heavy animals. You can't see
anything.
153302: The door is closed.
153355: You can't fit through the windows.
153450: A large, evil-looking creature is tethered to one side. It sports an
astonishingly long tail, and an astonishing assortment of claws. The claws are
stained
153604: The length of orange is rather jarring, though it fits well enough on
its back.
153666: It's a potent thing. The creature is higher at the shoulder than the
top of your head. It stands on two legs, naked and clawed like a giant bird's,
but thick with scarred muscle. An orange-furred torso cants forward, balanced
by a stiff tail, which is longer than the rest of the animal together. A shaggy
black-striped mane runs up the neck and surrounds the head; but the face is
long, a river-snapper's fanged face, with evil eyes angled close together at
the top. Hunter eyes, you feel sure. Its arms seem small, tucked against its
chest, but you wouldn't care to try its reach -- especially of the massive,
sabre-like claw that is most of its right hand.
154221: A length of orange leather fits neatly across the creature's back.
154301: The creature snaps its gaze to you. After a moment of unnerving,
unblinking regard, it bares its pointed teeth and returns to studying the
walls.
154409: The clawed creature gleefully ignores you.
154445: The creature snaps its gaze to you. After a moment of unnerving,
unblinking regard, it bares its pointed teeth and returns to studying the
trees.
154581: It'll never work. It has many more teeth than you do.
154629: You doubt it would take much provocation to get yourself mauled --
harness or no harness.
154699: The creature snaps interestedly at your hand, or tries to.
154806: aupfpm, trying to hit the ground rolling. You manage the hitting
part.

You stagger up
154886: , watching -- the crested creature is in the midst of a tremendous
leap, right over the river. It sails towards the far bank, and
155008: ; but your erstwhile mount doesn't quite make the distance. It crashes
into the water, spluttering and thrashing, and is slowly swept away. The
crested creature has vanished as well.
155140: exm. One after another, they tear away on the far side.
155383: aupfpm. It flicks its tail -- in respect, perhaps -- and flashes away
to the west.
155459: aupfpm. It stomps a foot, without much real threat, you hope.
155523: You can't drape the leather on the animal's back when you're sitting
there.
155578: It would just fall off onto the ground.
155618: It's hard enough staying on.
155674: The creature ducks its head.
155698: The creature turns away, nearly knocking you down with its heavy tail.
155755: The fur is sharply acrid.
155779: You sneak a very cautious peek.
155843: The creature pushes back.
155944: You cling to straps as the ground blurs.
155980: A couple walking hand-in-hand are knocked aside as your mount darts
between them.
156042: The clawed creature gleefully ignores you.
156806: The creature is across the building in a single flat leap, its neck
lowered, the tail up and straight back. You spin; it
157005: You hear a piercing wail from outside; then a shriek fades to distance,
followed by clattering claws.
157118: It's wearing the orange leather, but that's all.
157155: You find nothing unusual.
157201: You fit the leather over the animal's back. The ends hang neatly in
front of its legs.
157324: You can't take the leather; you're sitting on it.
157389: aupfpm's back. It hisses and rears -- not angrily, just stretching --
157447: and you bury your hands in the black mane, trying not to slide down the
nearly vertical spine. The creature hisses again.
157532: and you grab for support, trying not to slide down the nearly vertical
spine. The orange leather gives your legs purchase, though, and you steady
yourself with some convenient straps.
157661: ksfo ixn
The creature runs away without you, humming "Umbabara'uma."
[BUG]
157813: With the power of desperation, the crested creature launches itself
over the water. It hangs for a moment in the light -- and then your own mount
gathers itself, and the world is momentarily as distant as the sky --
157982: Cool silence surrounds you. The clawed creature, clearly not used to
water, begins to thrash around. Unfortunately, you are tangled in straps; you
don't quite manage to get clear, and your mount doesn't quite learn to swim.
158165: into dry earth, and your abused fingers finally slip. The ground smacks
you hard. By the time you pull yourself to your feet, both animals are gone.
158379: The creature digs in its claws, scoring the cobblestones, and comes to
a halt at the edge of the river. It glances back at you, not even breathing
hard, and with an astonishing glint -- who envies who now?
158659: The crested creature swerves south, dashing down the mall.
158714: The crested creature is just a few yards ahead of you.
158765: The crested creature is heading straight at the river!
158809: The crested creature is sprinting ahead of you, sides heaving.
158881: The crested creature shrieks as you come into view; it leaps, is jerked
short by its tether, yanks, and yanks again. And again, as your mount twists in
midair, hissing in triumph. You lose your grip and the ground strikes you
violently in the side; and perhaps that's best, for by the time you pull
yourself up, the clawed creature is gone. There is only the scent of blood and
the icy raw memory of the death-cry.
159205: The crested creature shrieks as you come into view. It leaps for the
arch, eyes darting back at your mount.
159298: The crested creature freezes as you come into view, then shrieks. Then
it takes off in a flail of claws -- but too late. Your mount twists in midair,
hissing in triumph. You lose your grip and the ground strikes you violently in
the side; and perhaps that's best, for by the time you pull yourself up, the
clawed creature is gone. There is only the scent of blood and the icy raw
memory of the death-cry.
159838: A pair of large, evil-looking creatures are tethered to one side. They
sport astonishingly long tails, and an astonishing assortment of claws. The
claws of one are stained green, matching the dyed leather of its harness; the
other's claws and tack are violet.
160216: . A side strap loops around a hook on the wall.
160251: . A side strap hangs loose.
160336: Several moments of determined sawing, and the strap parts.
160389: The leather won't snap.
160415: The leather won't burn.
160521: A torn, shredded carcass lies here, leaking blood and entrails. Flaps
of plush tan hide lie across the ground, and black mane, and the bony crest
still juts from the skull, half-severed as it is -- entirely horrible.
160681: People step around it, looking everywhere but down.
160787: The blood is slowly drying in the sun.
160819: It's dried to a crusty black.
160859: It's dark red, still fluid, mostly.
160900: It's dark red, crusted black at the edges.
160945: It's mostly a dark brown crust, fluid red here and there.
160991: It's a blackened, dried crust.
161016: Do you really want more detail?
161089: No need to make things any messier.
161121: Everyone knows it's bad luck to stand where someone -- or even
something -- has been murdered.
161195: Rusty, rank... a hint of... never mind.
161236: No.
161269: Ctli  Yxm
A team of men and women, wearing silvery-grey silk, surround
the corpse. They slide it carefully onto a sheet and carry it away. Little is
left but the drying blood.
161418: No.
161670: . Then a single heavy thud; and
161802: The bushes are pretty, but not very well-trimmed, and they're heavier
and thornier than they look.
161889: A glint under one bush looks more metallic than floral.
161935: A bright silver ring lies under one bush.
161989: Bending, you see a silver ring with a bit of chain attached.
162032: Good black soil, but nothing else.
162064: The marble statue stands in the center of the bushes.
162108: The branches are thorny and tangled. It's not worth the blood.
162162: There's no point in losing things in the bushes.
162223: What, that glint under the bush?
162248: You slide a hand carefully under thorns, and -- ouch -- manage to snag
the ring.
162360: The bushes surround the statue; you cannot approach closely.
162427: You can't see from the sunlight into the dim interior.
162479: What, that glint under the bush?
162507: It's a plain ring, of silver, or at least something as brightly
polished. A fine glittering chain is attached to the edge. And the last link of
the chain looks broken, as if it had once been longer.
162670: The chain spins on your finger, invisible in the darkness.
162716: The chain spins and sparkles from your finger.
162757: The chain spins, invisible in the darkness.
162793: The chain spins and sparkles.
162831: You slip on the ring. Its chain hangs loose across your hand.
162952: The alley is off to the east.
162999: There is a small ceramic square lying on the ground here.
163058: The building to the west is particularly pleasant; brick scrollwork
surrounds the door and runs up the facade. The door is
163175: The door to the west building seems to be locked from the inside.
163255: There are no windows.
163298: You stand.
163319: You find nothing but feet. People look curiously at you.
163367: You sit, finding a moment of stillness.
163483: You can't see from the sunlight into the dim interior.
163599: . In its center is a pair of bare footprints, slight depressions in the
veined black marble. Another is visible near the pedestal's edge, as if a
statue had just stepped down for a moment-- And you smile.
163770: You leave the platform.
163799: The marble is polished and cool. The footprints are the only flaw, and
they are carved delicately enough that you can almost feel the whorls of the
skin that left them.
163934: You step up onto the platform. You try to match your feet to the
footprints, but they are noticably smaller than your own.
164021: You sit, finding a moment of stillness.
164069: You can't hear anything from this side of the river.
164108: The park is across the river.
164138: The river isn't large, no more than five or six yards wide. You can't
see the bottom; perhaps that's just the murky water, but then again you sense
quiet depths.
164260: The far side of the river is closely lined with rough-cut hedges.
Through a gap you can see people strolling, a grassy park, a flagpole.
164360: The far side of the river is the broad square you remember. It's still
full of people, still silent.
164487: You have nothing in which to carry water.
164525: You kneel and scoop some water to your lips. It's... well, it's a bit
murky and stagnant.
164597: Wet, and a bit slimy.
164619: You can't see far into the water.
164651: You're not likely to empty the river.
164685: The river makes no sound.
164709: Five or six yards isn't wide for a river, but it's farther than you can
jump.
164781: You hesitate. The surface is a bit ruffled farther out, as though by a
gentle current. And nobody else is swimming.
164867: You gather yourself, and dive in. The murky silence surrounds you, and
then rushes away as you break the surface again. But you're farther downstream
than you thought; the current isn't so gentle, after all. And the river is
narrowing. And the banks are steep walls here...

You pull yourself ashore,
beyond a long struggle of exhaustion, and far from where you were.
165163: You crush the pod. Oil splashes into the water, and spreads into bright
queasy rainbows. It's rather more disturbing than pretty, but the swirling film
of color is slowly carried away.
165322: You empty the jar into the river.
165356: You empty the jar. Oil splashes into the water, and spreads into bright
queasy rainbows. It's rather more disturbing than pretty, but the swirling film
of color is slowly carried away.
165608: The plaza is off to the west.
165634: A lumpy chunk of granite stands here, embedded end-on in the
cobblestones. It's taller than you... and then the curves click, and you are
looking at an abstracted human figure. A woman, you think. Its shadow is black
syrup poured down the alley and up the east wall.
165826: There is artistry here, the skill to bring a human form out of such
rough, irregular carving. The figure is facing west, towards the plaza, and the
aura of its posture is... you are not sure. A familiar black shadow stretches
behind it.
166002: You notice a small chip of clay lying by the statue's base.
166071: The statue is much too heavy to move.
166103: The granite is rough, with chisel marks clear on it.
166147: There's no way to tell; the statue is much too heavy to move.
166201: However, you notice a small chip of clay lying by the statue's base.
166298: The shadow is opaque, and pulsates violently as you move.
166351: You smell nothing.
166439: in every direction as you dash into it. Sudden hurried footsteps behind
you become muffled, then merge into the faint rustle of a thousand silent
people in a crowd that stares at you, invisible, inaudible, not there at all --
166770: glances around, tense. But
167065: silks. The two, in unison, gesture you away.
167111: The trees are too small to support your weight.
167156: Some of the trees have benches resting under them.
167698: The crowd surges up and down the mall.
167727: They look about like people. The clothes are a little strange, with
long archaic-looking folded sleeves. But by far the oddest thing is that
everyone is quiet. They look at each other, smile, move their hands, nod; but
nobody speaks.
167903: The crowd is absolutely quiet, except for rustling of clothing and
movement.
167968: You see no one who looks like Aessa.
168003: The people around you turn, in utter shock and horror.
168073: Nobody pays much attention.
168338: Copper hair swings through the crowd, familiar for an instant, then
gone. You search the many faces around you -- Aessa couldn't be in this strange
place, could she? You do not see her now. If ever.
168727: Someone stumbles into you. You glance back, and a
169946: The back of your neck itches. You glance and see
170099: The back of your neck itches. Before you can react,
170181: seize your arms from behind. You are marched back to the plaza and
deposited definitively on the cobblestones.
170274: A stumpy old woman wearing blue silk stands here.
170314: She's built like a short barrel, with grey hair. Some amusement
glitters in her eyes. She's wearing
170402: There is a wiry woman here, in yellow silk.
170442: She has a wiry figure, with snow-frost hair, but the poise of a
whippet. She's wearing
170522: A tall, muscular man in blue silk stands here.
170562: He looks like he tosses cows in his spare time -- possibly over
buildings. His arms, legs, and chest are slabs of muscle. So is his face. The
man is wearing
170690: There is a stout dark-haired woman here, in yellow silk.
170738: She has a wiry figure, with snow-frost hair, but the poise of a
whippet. She's wearing
170818: A tall, peculiar-looking young man in blue silk stands here.
170866: He's skinnier than he is tall, with unkempt hair. He has
170946: There is a lean, wrinkled woman here, in yellow silk.
170994: She's quite old, with a worn wrinkled face, but her frame is lean and
tall. She's wearing
171074: You move through scattered trees and shrubbery.
171151: Something rushes through the hedges, just beyond sight -- no, two
things, one on the other's heels.
171234: Perhaps it's silly to assume it's a flagpole, given the absence of flag
at the top. It's just a pole; a single bole of polished blonde wood, narrow
enough to encircle with your two hands. The unadorned top rises higher than the
trees, and it casts a line of inky shadow across the grass and the more mundane
shadows of the trees.
171472: Several people are investigating the shadow.
171519: You jump and grab, but you can't get much a grip with your legs, and
you're not strong enough to pull yourself up with arms alone. Eventually you
slide your meager few handspans to the ground.
171663: A few people, watching, smile and shrug good-naturedly.
171770: The shadow is a narrow and eye-aching dark.
171808: Several people are standing or kneeling around it, examining and
prodding.
171871: You reach into the shadow, and in, in, and the farther you stretch the
farther there is to go -- you pull back, shivering.
171965: Watching, someone asks, "
172076: One of the people standing nearby cries "Dae!"
172243: -- And the darkness remains. You jerk around wildly, panicked -- lost
in shadow? No; you are real again, at least, and there's solid ground
underfoot.
172362: You make your winding way through the hedges.
172439: Nothing rests on the pedestal but the sculpture.
172482: There's no room.
172531: You can't move the pedestal.
172562: The construction is complex. Two heavy metal columns rise from the
pedestal, somewhat taller than you; they lean sharply away from each other.
Bridging the space between the columns, and apparently tethering them together,
is a series of horizontal metal wires. And a wide bronze disc hangs from the
midpoint of one wire, waist-high in the center of the sculpture.
173096: You draw a thrumming note from one wire.
173132: The wires are under too much tension to flex.
173223: The bottom surface of the disk is smooth, and slightly hollowed. A few
unreadable runes are marked inside one edge.
173309: You can just feel the etched lines on the bronze.
173392: A deep chime spreads between the trees.
173505: The last whisper of the disc's vibration dies away.
173554: Both columns are square in cross-section, but they are slanted steeply
away from the vertical, and from each other. They seem about to fall, in fact,
but for the wires that bind them together. The left column is polished to a
near-mirror finish; the right one, in contrast, is rough.
173769: The columns are rigidly anchored.
173928: You rap on the left column, then the right. Each emits a deep gentle
174095: You climb up into a tree. There's really nothing there, so you drop to
the ground.
174161: Just grass, and the occasional park-goer.
174199: The bushes are too dense to push into.
174233: The hedges smell of cool damp soil.
174276: A pair of tiny eyes stare back at you, and then blink, and then vanish.
174327: Nothing but rich soil.
174346: The people here are in short robes or caped tunics. They stroll between
the hedges, sit under trees, walk hand-in-hand.
174447: Several are investigating the flagpole and its shadow.
174495: A few people are talking quietly to each other; most are just enjoying
the park.
174888: One of the people standing around the flagpole looks up and shrugs,
saying, "
175145: knocks briskly on the bronze disc. A deep chime rolls across the park.
175381: Nobody pays much attention.
176225: A ceramic square is lying here, emitting a tiny jet of blue flame.
176289: You can't read the symbols printed on the ceramic square.
176330: It's a thin square of some pale ceramic, about as wide as two of your
fingers together. The edges and corners are a little rounded; the surface is
matte, not polished. A few symbols are stamped on one side, slightly smudged,
in bright red ink.
176508: A deep groove cuts diagonally across one corner of the square. That
corner bears a red dot.
176583: One corner of the square is gone. A tiny hot needle of blue flame jets
from the break.
176649: One corner of the square is gone. The break is clean and straight, just
slightly rough.
176766: The square is warm, particularly near the broken corner.
176810: The square feels like ceramic: smooth, dry, a little chalky.
176934: You can't break the square anywhere else.
176984: The corner breaks off easily along the groove. The snap is followed by
a faint hiss; and then you jerk your fingers quickly away, for a tiny, blue-hot
jet of flame has begun to shoot from the broken edge.
177183: It has a distant, acrid odor, like steamed elixirs.
177229: Ow!
177239: The flame hisses gently.
177303: The blue flame is weakening.
177336: The blue flame is flickering badly.
177423: The corner feels like ceramic: smooth, dry, a little chalky.
177473: You can't break the corner any further.
177517: You can't reattach the corner to the square.
177578: What, the one lying on the ground here?
177609: It's a small, triangular chip of ceramic. The edges are worn and
weathered grey, although there is yet a trace of something red on one side, and
the long edge of the triangle seems slightly rough.
177759: The chip feels like ceramic: smooth, dry, a little chalky.
177850: You can't attach the chip to the square, although it looks the right
shape to replace the broken corner.
177943: What, the one lying on the ground here?
178443: The music cuts off instantly.
178508: The sleeping man rolls to his feet, instantly alert. He stares blankly
at you for a moment, and then dashes away to the southwest.
178778: You stand up again.
178793: But you aren't in anything at the moment.
178834: You stand up again.
178868: You raise your head carefully, peering over the grass that hides you.
178922: You stand on the roots, grasp at a convenient burl, and drag yourself
up onto the lowest limb.
179035: The bark is warm.
179055: The path of trampled grass leads up to the tree, widening to a circle
around its trunk. Strange -- you see no fallen leaves, not even decayed
fragments.
179202: The shadow is familiarly black. It stretches east into the distance, so
tall is the tree.
179279: You smell a hint of sweat, food, dung, hay. City-smell.
179522: A bar of blackness falls across the grass, lying east-west.
179570: The shadow is familiarly black. It stretches from where the tree stands
in the west, past you, and east into the distance.
179882: You swing down.
179911: You're a little too high to jump safely.
180003: The bark is warm.
180023: The path of trampled grass leads up to the tree, widening to a circle
around its trunk.
180113: aupfxm in the tree's shadow; but nothing happens. The shadow isn't
abnormally dark up here -- only on the ground. (No, that doesn't make any
sense.)
180234: You hold your hand in the tree's shadow; but nothing happens. The
shadow isn't abnormally dark up here -- only on the ground. (No, that doesn't
make any sense.)
180356: The shadow is on the ground, down below.
180479: You have nothing in which to carry water.
180517: The water is searingly cold in your hands. It tastes of hidden stone.
180599: There is nothing in the water. You cannot see into the crack.
180651: The spring has probably been flowing for centuries. You won't empty it.
180763: You crush the pod. Oil splashes into the water, and spreads into bright
queasy rainbows. It's rather more disturbing than pretty, but the swirling film
of color is rapidly carried away.
180922: You empty the jar into the rivulet.
180958: You empty the jar. Oil splashes into the water, and spreads into bright
queasy rainbows. It's rather more disturbing than pretty, but the swirling film
of color is rapidly carried away.
181218: You are on the slope of the hill.
181258: You are on the side of the hill.
181298: You are on the slope of the hill.
181338: You are on the slope of the hill.
181378: This is the north end of the flattened strip.
181442: You are in a wide area of trampled-flat grass. The strip extends north,
and a circle of bare dirt lies south; a smaller path runs northeast.
181602: This is a wide circle of dry earth, carefully cleared and packed. The
tall grass stands on either side, but to the north and south, the grass is
crushed down to the soft texture of the paths.
181778: You are at the south end of a wide area of trampled-flat grass. A
circle of bare dirt lies north.
181874: You are waist-deep in the thick yellow grass, an unremarkable spot.
181943: Best not. You'd never find it again in this unmarked, dry ocean.
181994: The grass is trampled down in a circle here, a few yards wide. A
flattened path runs towards the hillside to the south, and another leads
southwest
182161: You begin to circle around the sleeping man. He shifts as you take
another step... and another... and he is on his feet, seemingly without
transition. A blow with the haft of his spear leaves you gasping, and he
disappears to the southwest.
182370: A youngish man is sitting in the circle's center, slumped sideways,
clearly asleep. A spear rests laxly in his hand.
182468: The man comes awake like a cat, instantly alert. Unlike a cat, he
doesn't give you a chance to run away before he kills you.
182562: The man doesn't react, probably because his eyes are closed.
182612: The man appears quite content with his situation as it is.
182653: The man rolls to his feet, instantly alert, steadying his spear. He
gives a great shout and dashes off to the southwest.
182759: You hear quiet breathing.
182845: xkmli    a.
Lying very near the man
183183: aupfxm from the ground. The man snorfles slightly
183348: The hand snaps shut on the spear, possibly an instant before you touch
it. The man jerks the spear furiously away from you, rolls to his feet, and
skewers you without hesitation.
183487: Very sharp.
183508: Oh, don't.
183529: Such a gesture might be taken badly.
183829: A tiny trickle of oil burns steadily on the side of the jar, not quite
reaching the ground.
183897: A small trickle of oil drips down its side to smear the ground beneath.
184191: neatly on your palm. The sides are straight; the lip is only slightly
tapered. The jar is made of pale, unornamented ceramic, marked only by a dark
smudge a bit below the lip.
184348: The jar is full of water and ice.
184376: The jar is full of water.
184404: A steady trickle of water drips down its side, below the smudge.
184454: The jar is full of oil.
184487: A small steady trickle of oil burns on the outside of the jar.
184535: A steady trickle of oil drips down its side, below the smudge.
184669: A drop of water falls on your leg.
184712: A drop of water rolls down the side of the jar.
184775: Water is trickling across your fingers. You glance down.
184838: Water is trickling down the side of the jar. You bend closer.
184937: A drop of oil falls on your leg.
184978: A drop of oil rolls down the side of the jar.
185044: Oil is trickling across your fingers. You glance down.
185107: Oil is trickling down the side of the jar. You bend closer.
185198: The tiny flame on the jar gutters out.
185258: The jar is already full of water.
185291: The jar is already full of oil.
185376: You dunk the jar and let water bubble in.
185418: The pod ruptures easily, and an acrid oil splashes into the jar.
185773: The smudge on the jar smears, a bit, leaving your fingertip black.
185831: You have no way to attach the shards together. Even if you did, much as
you love jigsaws, it would take hours to sort them all out.
185930: It's a small rod of cloudy greenish glass, or perhaps crystal.
185987: One end is cut cleanly, but the other is slightly worn and rounded.
186041: One end is cut cleanly, but the other is worn and rounded.
186089: One end is cut cleanly, but the other is worn and rounded. The rod
seems shorter than when you found it.
186169: One end is cut cleanly, but much of the other end is eroded away.
186221: One end is cut cleanly, and there's not much left beyond that.
186343: Most of the surface is polished, but the worn end is slightly rough,
almost sticky.
186415: The rod has a powerful odor, somewhere between spicy and cool. And,
mmm, fruity? And... blue?
186486: You take another sniff. It definitely smells cool, and fruity, and
blue. And spicy. Whatever spicy blue smells like, this is it. Your sinuses buzz
faintly.
186817: The taste in your mouth becomes cool and vaguely metallic.
186865: Your tongue begins to burn with a sweetish, spicy aftertaste.
187126: It's water, slightly muddy and greenish.
187160: It's water, starlight-clear.
187194: It's water, with a few shards of ice floating in it.
187244: It's water, although a skin of ice covers it.
187290: The water is heavily crusted with ice.
187327: The water has a thick, cracked layer of ice.
187437: You crack away the layer of ice.
187469: You empty the jar, wincing slightly at the stagnant aftertaste.
187514: You drain the jar. The water still has a distant mineral taste.
187571: It tastes stagnant.
187586: It tastes fresh.
187609: It smells stagnant.
187655: You crack away some of the ice in the jar.
187713: You crack away the layer of ice, and upend the jar.
187754: The water splashes away.
187837: That would probably be considered rude.
187875: You crack away the layer of ice, and upend the jar.
188036: The oil has a powerful, sweet-acrid odor; it stings your eyes.
188090: You gingerly touch your tongue to the oil -- and spit. It's awful; a
bitter flavor that burns your tongue.
188174: A bit slippery.
188206: The oil splashes out, and evaporates with unnatural speed.
188313: That would probably be considered rude.
188362: aupg.. It evaporates almost immediately, leaving no trace.
188421: The fiery trickle is outside the jar. The rest of the oil is inside the
jar. You really can't get the one to the other.
188506: You angle the flame into the jar's mouth. Gingerly... Ah! A single
white flare roars out of the jar, all the oil burning nearly at once. You
squint away just as the jar bursts into hot shards
188695: I don't see how.
188746: A trickle of oil oozes from the jar, apparently straight from the clay,
just below the lip.
188816: It feeds a tiny flame that burns on the side of the jar.
188857: It drips down the side and falls steadily.
188895: I don't see how.
188922: You have no desire to drink flaming oil.
188969: The oil has a powerful, sweet-acrid odor. Its flame gives off no smoke.
189040: You don't need experiment to tell what would happen if you put your
finger in the fire.
189121: The trickle of oil is already burning.
189153: The trickle of oil flares, then settles to a tiny flame dancing just
below the jar's lip. There is just enough oil flowing to burn, it seems, for
nothing drips farther down the side.
189351: Ehm
The layer of ice in the jar is beginning to melt.
189414: The layer of ice in the jar is breaking up.
189465: Exm
Only a few bits of ice are left floating in the jar.
189530: The last of the ice in the jar is gone.
189606: Needles of ice are forming in the jar of water.
189659: Ehm
The water in the jar has a thin skin of ice on it.
189718: Axm
The ice in the jar is thicker.
189767: There is a faint pop from within the jar.
189820: There is a loud pop from what was just the clay jar.
189922: Ceramic shards spray across the ground, leaving a lump of ice.
190016: It's just a tiny lump of cloudy ice.
190050: It's a small lump of veined ice.
190075: It's a vaguely jar-shaped lump of veined, cracked ice.
190129: You crunch on the ice for a while, finally reducing it to a mouthful of
splinters. Brrr.
190200: The ice burns your fingers, but water drips from it.
190261: When you open your hand, there is nothing left.
190360: The lump of ice is beginning to melt.
190413: Water drips from the lump of ice.
190460: The last bit of ice melts away.
190564: You hold the flame to a stalk of grass, and it catches easily. So does
another. And, and, oh,
190676: The grass is saw-edged and rough. The blades rattle slightly as you
touch them.
190738: I think the grass has you outnumbered.
190772: The dry grass has no particular odor.
190804: The grasses rattle gently, with a sound like distant rain.
190855: You part the stalks and peer at the roots. There's nothing there but
arid earth. Of course, all Muo's diamonds and Awas's pearls could be scattered
in the grass, and you'd never see one until you stepped on it.
191036: You are already hunched down in the grass.
191070: You crouch, ducking your head below the tops of the stalks.
191116: Which way? The grass rises in almost every direction.
191560: You are too far away.
191585: You can see a muddle of tents down at the base of the hill, spreading
around most of the west side.
191656: A disorderly cluster of tents runs along the west side of the hill.
Twenty yards or so of tall grass separate the path from the encampment. There
is a large cleared area among the tents,
191945: The tents are mostly hidden by the curve of the hill. You haven't a
good view.
192002: The tents are low, slanting affairs, made from some sort of animal
skin. You see palest grey, golds, browns, blacks, and several with wavery
stripes. A few figures move from tent to tent; they are short, fair people,
mostly in leather themselves, although with not a few scarves and ribbons in
bright color.
192267: The encampment is quite a distance away, to the west.
192327: The encampment is quite a distance away.
192356: You're not in the encampment.
192391: The cleared area is surrounded by motionless figures. At one end,
several people are carrying oddly-proportioned wooden boxes; they hold the
boxes near their open mouths, eyes closed in concentration, fingers tapping,
and it is from these that the music arises.
192590: A man and woman circle each other in an intense dance, in the cleared
area to the west. His eyes are painted across a black stripe; hers with white.
192709: A man and woman circle each other in an intense dance, in the cleared
area to the west. His eyes are painted across a black stripe; hers with grey.
The woman's shape is swollen in pregnancy.
192856: A man and woman circle each other in an intense dance, in the cleared
area to the west. Her eyes are painted across a grey stripe; his face bears
jagged violet and black lines. The woman's shape is swollen in pregnancy.
193023: A man circles in an intense dance, in the cleared area to the west. His
face bears jagged violet and black lines.
193116: A man kneels in the cleared area to the west, face upturned. His face
and hands are smeared with violet and black paint.
193243: You hear the sound of dripping water, from somewhere to the west.
193300: The sound continues, precise... you're not sure it's water now. The
sound is too rich; it almost echoes.
193391: A second tapping noise begins, off-stepped from the first, at an odd
angle of harmony.
193464: The rhythms speed, glancing up and down an unfamiliar chord.
Under-steps and syncopations are creeping in.
193547: ypm
A deep wail splits the wind; the harmonic rhythms fall into
support. The wail is unearthly, a powerful resonance that nonetheless has the
shape of a human voice.
193676: More voices join, higher and lower, all with that shimmering strength.
The beating rhythms surge.
193757: The wailing harmonies rise and fall.
193794: The rhythms catch and redouble.
193829: The choir splits into an eerie progression of chords.
193878: The rhythms and wailing notes flare, everywhere, in your mind.
193935: The rhythmic beating ceases abruptly; the voices contract into a single
rising note.
194006: The voices rise to a shriek, and plummet into reverberating silence.
194150: A man leaps into the cleared area, whirling in dance. His face is
painted with a narrow black mask; and as he turns, a woman spins in, balancing
his movements from behind white mask-paint.
194295: The dancers leap into an intricate series of turns, forward and
backward around each other's motion.
194376: The man drops forward; the woman takes one final leap towards him, and
is borne upwards, as he extends and launches her out of the circle entirely.
But without a pause, another woman whirls into view. Her garb is identical to
the first woman's; but her mask-paint is grey, and she is roundly pregnant (or
so her costume's shape suggests).
194627: The dance has widened. The woman shifts back and forth; now in the
man's circle of movement; now in a gentle pirouette by herself, with her arms
circled around her rounded abdomen.
194768: The man's dance becomes more agitated; his turns are sharper, his leaps
higher and more tense. Finally he leaps out of the cleared area and vanishes.
Immediately, another man spins into the empty space in the motion. His face is
painted in fierce jagged lines of black and violet, and his dance rages.
194991: The woman looks up, finally, from the slow simple head-lowered turn she
has been absorbed in. She recoils, and is driven back by the force of the man's
motion. They poise like that for a moment: the man advancing, the woman sliding
sideways and away from him. Then she covers her grey-painted eyes with her
hands, bows, and falls backwards out of the dance.
195254: The man, alone now in the circle, goes into a furious spin. His hands
are over his face, and he turns and turns on one spot until the whole world is
wrapped around him -- and then it tears, and he collapses to his knees. His
upturned face is just smears of black and color, now, and his hands seem to
bleed violet.
195485: The crowd melts away into the encampment, and the area is left empty.
195601: Interpret it yourself. I'm just the author.
195715: You cannot see the source of the sounds.
195761: The sounds come from the west, from the figures holding their wooden
boxes.
195814: The sounds come from somewhere to the west.
195866: Something taps rhythmically, off to the west.
195906: A complex pattern beats rhythmically in the air.
195946: A complex pattern taps over a single human voice.
195986: Voices resonate together, rising.
196011: The music fills everything, rhythm and shimmering voice.
196053: Rich as it is, it's just sound.
196087: You can't make out much detail from here, but the boxes seem similar to
the one you found in the theater.
196165: You can't make out much detail from here, but the boxes seem strange.
196216: They're somewhat trapezoidal, no two faces parallel. The players hold
their boxes just in front of the lips, or below the chin; their mouths are
open, singing long notes that resonate inhumanly. Several are also striking the
boxes rhythmically.
196503: There are lots of them; they look very grim; and they're not waiting
around while you weigh the situation.
196582: You can't make out the source of the noise. But it sounds like you
won't have to wait too long.
196704: It sounds like a great many people running through the grass.
196752: You're too far from whatever's making the noise.
196807: You're too far from whatever is making the noise.
196855: You manage to seriously injure the foremost spearman.
196899: There is something very wrong with your judgement of character.
196958: Light conversation does not divert the mob.
196996: Apparently, they don't care.
197024: That'll help a lot.
197098: i.
A wave of people -- men and women -- pour out of the tents to the
197199: . They are all holding spears or knives. Holding, not brandishing or
waving them; they look very businesslike. They are running through the grass
towards you, needless to say.
197418: The mob runs past you, turns around, and begins performing selected
scenes from "Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead." [BUG]
197532: A stampede of spearmen pours around the base of the tree. You look down
at them. They look up at you. Maybe, you think, they don't know how to climb
trees?

Or throw those spears?
197670: A stampede of spearmen pours over you.
197702: A stampede of spearmen pours towards you. Straight towards you; they
don't even seem to notice that you're supposed to be invisible...
197801: Your last hope is that they'll suffer fiercely from the disappointment
of having killed you so easily.
197878: mtib.
You hear a sudden crackling and rattling of grass to the
197925: . You can't make out much, but there's a lot of it -- getting louder.
197981: i.
Whatever is crashing through the grass to the
198516: You plunge straight into the teeth of the mob.
198562: The crushed grass muffles your footsteps.
198637: You take a step off the path. There is a dry rattle as you wade into
the grass... and a sudden shout that freezes you.
198744: You crawl desperately, but the sharp grass is slicing your hands and
face, and you make almost no progress. And the mob is quickly approaching.
198848: Crawling through this stuff would slice your hands and face to ribbons.
Best to stand up first.
198941: You plunge straight into the teeth of the mob.
198996: The grass crunches and crackles as you wade through it.
199040: You wade through the tall crackling grass.
199156: Which way?
199181: You strike off across the virgin snow. After no more than a few steps,
however, your foot crunches into ice and through it. Your balance is far gone,
and you flail as you plummet into blue-lit shadow --

The impact stuns you, and
bitter cold takes care of the rest.
199378: Blue sky glares above you, to the dead-white horizon, and between them
is nothing but wind and the cold. Snow crunches gently beneath your feet. Above
your head, a wind-sculpted spire of ice twists fantastically, and its shadow
lies as strange and utterly black against the glittering snow. You can make out
something dark to the south, a pole or column of some sort.
199642: Tracks in the snow lead south and southwest.
199682: Your feet scrape numbly through the snow, for a time.
199730: The horizon darkens as you walk. After a while, you can make out the
face of a low cliff ahead. It rises, until -- still distant -- it blots out the
sun; you pass into shadow.
199879: The edges of the spire's sculpted planes are razors. You take an
awkward grip, and try to pull yourself up; and you slide down again, leaving a
few drops of blood to crystallize in the wind.
200050: The shadow that you stepped out of is as black as the one you stepped
into. It lies in shocking contrast on the snow. In fact, it seems to be sunk
deep into the snow... not entirely an illusion, for its outline is melted
slightly into the frost. A slight but temperate breeze blows from the shadow.
200395: You smell nothing, but a hint of warm air -- warm for here -- plays on
your numb face.
200466: ausfxm crosses the line from blinding white to numb black. You cannot
see it, and then it is gone.
200727: Broad padded paws seem to have left these tracks. There are several
sets of prints, and they become somewhat mixed with your own, but they all seem
to run south and southwest.
200865: The tracks lead south and southwest.
200942: . There's a smudge of crimson at its base
201016: The pole is far to the south.
201087: The air thliceth you withouth rwemorthe. The horithon ith an irreguwar
wawl oth dh'irthy whithe againth bwue, and the thnow beneath you ith markth'dh
onwy by a fhew pawpwinthh. To the eatht andh thoutheahh, though, the ithe
fthalls away in'u an ablup', thadhowy cwethathe.
201280: The air slices you without remorse. The horizon is an irregular wall of
dirty white against blue, and the snow beneath you is marked only by a few
pawprints. To the east and southeast, though, the ice falls away into an
abrupt, shadowy crevasse.
201458: The tracks in the snow lead north, west, and southeast.
201506: Light gleams on the spire ahead as you push through bitter wind.
201589: You sit, grasp the icy lip, and swing yourself over the edge. You feel
for a foothold... there... and another... your hand slips --

The impact stuns
you, and bitter cold takes care of the rest.
201790: Your thonh' ith otherwithe occupiedh.
201836: You can' go anywhele! Your thonh' ith frothen t'o thith pole!
201905: You turn away from the pole.
201951: Broad padded paws seem to have left these tracks. There are several
sets of prints, and they become somewhat mixed with your own, but most of them
run north and west. However, a few tracks go southeast, right towards the
crevasse. They lengthen as they approach the lip, and pick up again across the
yards of air to the other side.
202193: The tracks lead north, west, and southeast across the crevasse.
202263: You can'h thee ith when you're thtuck wike thith.
202300: You peer down into a tumbled, sculpted abyss of blue shadow --
beautiful, but certainly deadly. You notice, though, that several tracks in the
snow lead right to the crevasse's rim, and pick up again beyond, as if
something was in the habit of leaping across. Whatever it is, it can leap much
farther than you.
202553: aupfxm over the edge. It vanishes into still blue depths with hardly a
sound.
202615: You can see nothing but ice and blue depths of shadow.
202659: The crevasse is much too wide.
202711: A me'al pole thtick'h outh 'rom the thnow, and your thonh' ith frothen
t'o ith.
202779: A' ith' fhoot thithh -- I wean th'ithhh -- hit'thhh -- There'th a red
fhuzthy bunbhle hewe, dammith.
202924: At its foot sits a red, fuzzy bundle, neatly folded and quite
outrageous in this chilly-white world.
203007: The pole ith zhuth thy of your own heighth. It'th unadhorned iwon, noth
ethen well polithed. Andh there's no needh to dwelw on the thact that you
203138: The pole is just shy of your own height. It's unadorned iron, not even
well polished.
203236: Yeah, righthe.
203249: The pole is bitter cold, painful even to touch, and you can see
perfectly well that there's nothing on top of it.
203361: The metal is bitter, painfully cold.
203414: It doethn'th bhudhghe.
203433: The pole feels like it's rooted in stone far below, and in all the ice
between that stone and your feet.
203518: You're wicking ith now, mowon! Ith thathes like ithe! Ith tathes like
your thonh' ith frothen t'o it!
203625: You plant your tongue on the pole. It immediately freezes in place.
Freethes im plathe.

203769: You holdh the thlame againth' the pole. Fhor a momen' nothing
hapthenth... then a hinth of wawmth. Thank the ghothh. You yank hardh.
203916: hat stings. A lot.
203948: You think to yourself what a bad idea it would be to lick the icy
metal.
204004: Are you crazy? Your tongue would freeze to the pole instantly.
204054: I will if you keep insisting. But I can't imagine where you got such a
disastrous notion.
204239: It'th a thick, fhuzthy bhrithe redh b'lanketh.
204274: It's a thick, fuzzy, bright red blanket.
204311: You wrap the blanket awkwardly around yourself.
204354: A bit of warmth begins to creep back.
204386: It's very warm.
204408: You unwrap yourself from the blanket.
204457: The wind immediately lashes you. Tears spring to your eyes, and freeze.
204513: The dim chill pours down your skin.
204546: The unbounded and bitter ice is broken, to the west; a low cliff rears
up all along that curve of the horizon. The sun is hidden behind the stony
wall, but soft beams of light seem to radiate from the cliff-edge, across the
sky and over your head.
204726: Tracks in the snow lead northeast, east, northwest, and southwest.
204778: Pawprints track through the snow nearby.
204818: The twisted spire grows slowly as you trudge across the ice.
204874: A faint shadow on the ice ahead slowly widens, until you reach the lip
of an unfathomable crevasse.
204954: Your feet crunch softly in the snow and cold. Eventually the ground
slopes up, as you reach the steep slope that is the northern extremity of the
cliff.
205066: You trudge through the shadow of the cliff, which gradually looms.
205135: Broad padded paws seem to have left these tracks. There are several
sets of prints, and they become somewhat mixed with your own, but the heaviest
trails run northeast, east, northwest, and southwest.
205289: The tracks lead northeast, east, northwest, and southwest.
205344: The cliff is far to the west.
205381: You're already in the cliff's shadow; you have been for some time.
205432: It's just shadow.
205456: The sunbeams are far out of reach.
205482: You stand on a steep angle, digging your feet carefully in the snow,
trying not to slip. The crest of this ridge rises to the west; the sun is
hidden behind it. To the south, the slope steepens.
205628: Tracks in the snow run south and southeast.
205690: You slither down the slope, and then set off across the icy plain.
205746: You move across the face of the slope, slowly upward. As you rise, the
snow thins; after a time, you move across bare chill stone.
205863: The prongs bite into your fingers, but they do not give. Whatever the
metal is, you are unable to untwist it.
205971: You hold one end of the twisted rod against the box's pale discs. The
prongs fit the incised stars once, you feel sure. No more.
206071: Broad padded paws seem to have left these tracks. There are several
sets of prints, and they become somewhat mixed with your own, but they seem to
lead south and southeast.
206201: The tracks lead south and southeast.
206234: You stand on the edge of a cliff, a silent wave of weathered stone; it
stares out over the equally silent sea of ice that lies to the east, and below.
The stark edge gentles and descends to the north, and the cliff steepens to the
south.
206408: A narrow crack runs through the rock, a few feet from the edge.
206463: The crack seems to be full of water.
206578: Ice traces the stones as you descend, then spreads.
206633: The cliff-edge is worn by centuries of the wind. You peer down --
carefully, with the wind a hand on your shoulder; but you can make out the
shadow of a gap in the cliff face, directly below you.
206775: There is a raw bite in the cliff-edge; it has split away entirely, at
the point where it was cracked. You can make out rubble lying at the cliff's
base.
206895: The stone is aching cold.
206922: The stone endures.
206971: As you wish.
206986: It's a few yards long, too narrow to fit more than a thumbnail into,
and much too thin and dark to make out depth. It runs parallel to the cliff's
edge, a couple of feet in.
207123: The crack is filled with freezing water.
207157: The crack is filled with water.
207205: The crack brims with freezing water.
207256: There's nothing in the crack, that you can see.
207298: Unlikely.
207341: You easily rupture the pod; an acrid oil spills out.
207389: The crack is already full of water. The oil forms a rainbow layer on
top, spilling across the stone, but it evaporates almost immediately.
207486: The oil fills the crack neatly. But it evaporates almost immediately,
leaving no trace.
207567: You crack away the layer of ice, and upend the jar.
207615: The crack is already full of water. The excess just spills across stone
and vanishes.
207689: The water fills the crack neatly. The stone must be whole, beneath, for
the level isn't sinking.
207922: The water fills the crack.
207957: It's laced with crystals of ice.
207993: It's rapidly freezing solid.
208031: Your tongue won't fit in the crack either.
208069: You can't imagine any way to get the water out of there.
208181: You look down, just in time to see the lip of the cliff slide away
towards the distant snow. Shards of ice follow, a glittering shower from the
crack that is now the cliff's new edge. The rumble fades below.
208347: You look up, just in time to see the lip of the cliff slide towards
you. You leap back, quickly, as heavy stone chunks crunch into the snow at the
cliff's base. The echoes fade; after a final delicate rain of flaked ice,
silence.
208517: A hint of motion, far to the west, draws your eye. Something on the
cliff? A long moment later, there is a distant rumble.
208718: The water in the crack is nearly frozen over.
208758: There is a faint pop from the ice in the crack. Another.
208874: The wind is a unending scream.
208902: The wind scrapes your skin raw.
208930: It's howling east, right off the cliff.
208961: You can't. It's wind.
209002: You thought the wind was deadly on the plain below... this stone is
thrust like a challenge into the bitter sky, and the sky assaults it. A
constant roar of ice blasts across you from the west. You would not care to
climb higher.
209206: The wind screams.
209226: The wind scours your face.
209252: The wind seems to lay open your bones.
209290: The snow ends here; to the west rises a massive, worn wall of stone. It
seems to press against you, even without touching, and against the unbounded
white world that stretches east. But it does little against the wind.
209452: Tracks in the snow run northeast.
209482: You move out, shivering, into the endless snow.
209576: The cave is out of your reach.
209599: You scramble up onto the rubble, and stretch... there, a hand on the
lip of the cave. Several moments of strenuous exercise, and you are inside.
209714: There is a cave in the cliff's face, a dark hole several feet above
your head.
209779: Rubble is mounded against the cliff, directly below the cave.
209834: The cave is a black circle on the stone. Unnaturally regular, now that
you look. Strange.
209907: But it's well out of your reach.
209935: The rubble is piled below it.
209979: You can't see into the cave from down here.
210055: Broad padded paws seem to have left these tracks. There are several
sets of prints, and they become somewhat mixed with your own, but they all seem
to run northeast.
210240: You'll never be able to shift the pile.
210274: Oh, leave it. It's just rock.
210306: You sit on the lip of the tunnel, turn, and carefully lower yourself to
the rubble below.
210378: A chunk of stone slides, but you manage to wobble your way off with
only a slight wrench to your ankle.
210482: As you move deeper into the tunnel, you feel the floor rising, very
slightly.
210588: The glow is far to the west.
210610: You walk towards the light.
210666: You walk towards the glow. The walls change, abruptly, from smooth
carved stone to milky blue ice.
210788: The bright spot is at the east end of the tunnel.
210844: The watery glow is far to the west.
210898: You leave, feeling again the faint downward and northward angle of the
tunnel. Stone surrounds you again.
211087: The ice is iron-hard.
211109: The ice burns your fingers implacably.
211143: You cannot make out what the shape is, that is caught within the ice to
the west.
211207: A spot of ice glistens, and a single tiny drop falls away, to freeze
again immediately to the wall.
211283: A roaring, whispering sussurus -- very faint -- emanates from the ice.
211360: You hear a distant, muted rush, more with your bones than your ears.
211427: The muted roar surges again.
211469: Behind the shape is nothing but the silent glow.
211504: The shape is deep within the ice.
211530: The edges of the shadow are indistinct, though still somehow
impenetrably dark.
211599: The shadow breathes a bitter, choking odor.
211749: -- Air scalds your face, and then is merely tepid, with a bitter
burning scent. The world is still dim, but with a strange glare --
211863: The cold prickles your half-numbed fingertips.
211910: Your thonh' ith colbh enout' alweady.
211939: You scoop up a few flakes. They melt slowly on your tongue, leaving a
sharp, electric taste: ...winter.
212023: You kneel, and melt a tiny hollow in the surface snow. As soon as you
stand, though, you lose it; one more shadow of white amid white.
212134: There's no need to start a collection.
212179: You scrape up a scant handful of snow.
212224: Just a handful of dry, powdery snow.
212258: Just a small handful of powdery snow.
212320: Just a tiny clot of snow.
212385: The snow is too powdery to make much of a snowball. When you throw it,
it just sprays.
212470: The snow scatters and is lost.
212505: Your thonh' ith colbh enout' alweady.
212536: The snow melts slowly on your tongue, leaving a sharp, electric taste:
...winter.
212604: You feed a few flakes to the fire. As you'd expect, they hiss and
vanish.
212720: The handful of snow is beginning to melt.
212771: Ahm
Water drips from the snow.
212826: The last bit of snow in the jar melts.
212892: The last bit of snow melts away.
212981: The wind smells of ozone and ice: the tang of the dead of winter.
213033: This land moans unremittingly -- twisting louder or softer sometimes,
but the wind is never gone.
213107: The wind bites your skin.
213131: "Who has seen her, following the wind?" Yes, very poetic, but not very
practical.
213192: You can't. It's wind.
213257: The wind shrieks.
213307: A knife of icy wind seems to lay open your bones.
213349: The wind slackens, then blasts again.
213383: A gust of wind nearly staggers you.
213415: The wind swirls.
213530: You circle the dome.
213554: The white figures seem to become more intent, drawing a little closer
to the bars.
213647: A thin chill breathes from the long shadow.
213907: Something in your hand feels less weighty.
213946: The west side of the circle is no different. Silver posts march around
the perimeter of the sand, beneath the impossible starry, sun-lit night sky.
The low dome rises to the east, at the circle's center
214146: You circle the dome.
214170: The white figures stir uneasily.
214229: The moon Amwal is high and rising. But it is yet low enough to cast a
knife-thin edge of shadow, on the west side of the dome.
214327: You notice a current of motion among the white figures as you turn
towards the shadow.
214409: The white outlines seem to vibrate as you bend over the dome.
214463: The edge of shadow has no odor at all.
214509: The white outlines seem to vibrate as you bend over the shadow.
214606: The white figures are whirling around the circle, echoing with harsh
grating tones. You ignore them -- are they
214763: across the sand, without seeming to change. The silver bars flicker
away into the black sky, one by one, and then the stars --
214874: -- There is nothing beneath your feet. You flail convulsively for a
moment, before you realize that you are not falling.
214996: Beyond the bars, something shifts. You spin; a hooded white outline
watches you, peering between the silver posts. Or at least it seems to. You can
make out no detail of face or feature in that indistinct figure. Nor in the one
next to it. You turn again; the circle is surrounded by a crowd of pale shapes.
215220: A crowd of white shapes moves in slow turmoil beyond the bars.
215274: They might be human, within those pale outlines. But you have doubt;
there is something about the way they move, stilt-angled.... The shapes keep
well back from the silver bars.
215439: Deep, discordant notes seem to grate from the white shapes.
215487: The white figures flinch away.
215515: The white figures flicker, and bend towards you, in return.
215577: The white shapes shift excitedly.
215621: aupfxm; one of the shapes bends towards you for a moment. Then it
twists away, and the crowd conceals it.
215707: They are much too strange, and anyway out of reach.
215749: You're not certain you want them any more aroused.
215817: Low tones grate through you, and you look up to see several of the
white shapes moving animatedly to the west, beyond the bars. There is something
about their motions -- are they gesturing to something behind you?
215977: A sound surrounds you, like the murmuring of stones; deep and
tumultuous, and harsh, though not loud.
216058: Each bar is the width of your two thumbs together. Each is
mirror-bright, so that your face stares back a thousand times, drawn
needle-slim.... The bars end twice your height above the sand; their spacing,
around the rim of the circle of sand, could be wide enough for you to squeeze
through. Beyond the bars, a barren plain of oily-looking earth reaches to the
edge of the starred sky.
216338: Indistinct white figures move slowly across it.
216383: The silver is cool.
216405: The white figures lurched forward as you reached out, but now they are
retreating again.
216475: There is nothing to climb to.
216605: The bar thuds dully.
216913: Your skin begins burning even as you reach between the bars. You draw
back hastily.
216978: To a glance, the outer plain simply seems to be dark, rich soil. But it
has an oily gleam, glistening with traces of a dozen dark, viscous colors. The
earth is harrowed and rutted.
217114: Above it, the white shapes move slowly back and forth.
217191: A thick, chokingly bitter odor drifts in from outside the circle.
217261: You step towards the bars; but the white shapes are suddenly agitated,
jerking back and forth just beyond the circle. You leap back, startled.
217542: Your skin begins burning even as you reach between the bars. You draw
back hastily.
217635: The pain fades to a faint itching.
217682: The white figures are suddenly still, for a moment. Then, one by
another, they fade into the lifeless distance.
217771: There is a foul, bitter taste in your mouth.
217811: Your head aches, and the foul taste burns on your tongue.
217855: ixn
You stumble; the world jostles with vertigo. Your blood pounds,
painfully.
217924: Your stomach knots. Everything seems ringed in light, and the roaring
sand is -- under your knees? -- something burns, ah --
218029: But something is wrong; your throat burns with a bitter reek, and an
ache pulses again and again in your head. There is no you but the crushing
pain, and the time of nothingness stretches, and stretches immeasurably. And
ends.
218194: The dome is a perfect hemisphere, of some glossy white substance. It
dimly reflects the sun and moons, but it has no other detail, or even texture.
218306: The dome casts a long black shadow across the sand at your feet.
218429: . What? Ah --
218510: The edge of shadow is gone, now; both moons are too high to cast any.
218585: You extend your hand, and then jerk it back. The substance of the dome,
featureless to the eye, feels as if it were
218674: in some icy-slick direction you cannot measure. Your fingertips are
warm and tingling.
218744: The dome is quite silent.
218768: The bottom edge of the dome disappears unremarkably into the grey sand.
218826: The setting sun casts a long shadow from the dome, across the sand.
218951: . What? Ah --
219032: The edge of shadow is gone, now; both moons are too high to cast any.
219092: You cannot see the other side of the dome from here.
219134: You cannot see into the dome.
219162: How?
219179: You strike the dome. On contact, your hand is snapped sharply to one
side. You stumble to your balance, rubbing your tingling skin.
219279: strikes the dome, and is snapped sharply to one side. You barely retain
your hold.
219363: You tilt the jar. A stream of
219497: ausfxm seems to rest on the dome for a splintered instant. Then it is
spinning in a high arc, that ends on the grey sand near your feet.
219610: The sand is bright, a million points of reflected light in grey, and
very, very clean. Nothing marks it but your own footprints, and even they are
blurred. The sand ends, very abruptly, at the silver bars; beyond that edge,
the ground is a tumbled, discolored soil.
219815: A perfectly clear glass sphere rests in the sand at your feet.
219912: There's no need to start a collection.
219951: You scoop up a handful of grey sand. It flows smoothly, trying to leak
out between your fingers.
220025: The sand slides around your finger like fur.
220063: The sand has no odor.
220102: A perfectly clear glass sphere rests in the sand at your feet.
220147: You scrape through the sand for a few moments. There doesn't seem to be
anything down there but more sand.
220345: yells "I can't see!" [BUG]
220428: There is a taste of an echo in the air, as if some sound had ceased a
fraction of a second before you could become aware of it.
220530: Every sound that surrounded you in the dark goes silent, all at once.
220594: You stand on packed mud, which spreads to the dim limits of your circle
of light, and who knows how far beyond. Above you, darkness; around you, the
same.
220739: The air is dead still.
220895: Dropped and lost.
220933: There is nothing tangible within your reach.
220982: You shift back and forth, but the sound is oddly difficult to locate.
221708: You advance through the blind dark.
221803: Above, the thrumming chord does as well.
221837: Above, the thrumming chord seems to keep pace with you.
221888: You pace across changeless mud.
221935: Something unseen resists your motion.
222145: A sharp, irregular rapping comes from somewhere nearby. Farther away,
to the west, is a jangle of bells; and a thin wailing drifts from the south.
222263: Whatever it is bubbles and pops happily to itself. It seems to be
coming from
222400: A cheery bubbling sound surrounds you.
222432: It sounds like something is bubbling merrily on the ground nearby.
222485: Whatever the bubbling is, it doesn't have any particular odor.
222623: It might be two boards clapping together in the dark. There is no
pattern that you can hear; slower, faster, a staccato burst, another, a pause.
The sound rings faintly in your ears.
222993: You are nearly deafened by unseen clangor. A thousand bells might be
roiling a foot above your head. The noise is dampened to the east, where you
can hear an occasional sharp rap, and to the north, where a echoing plipping
noise gives the impression of dripping water.
223185: You jump on the spot. Apparently there isn't anything above you, after
all.
223247: The noise is a thousand incessant bells, from a ice-sweet chime to a
fierce, deep gongen. Not one of them pauses, for one moment.
223342: Somewhere behind the noise, there is an indistinct voice, chanting: "
223633: You are surrounded by a thin, high wailing sound; it wavers up and
down, setting your ears on edge. A rattling hiss is audible to the southeast, a
much deeper rumble to the southwest, and there is an occasional echoing rap
from the north.
223807: The sound might almost be a human voice; but it stretches and
stretches, without breath. Or might it be many voices, a thousand?
224175: There is a deafening blare, and something rushes right past your face,
horribly fast. More blaring calls and squeals erupt. You back away, hurriedly.
224285: Something strikes you a crushing, but utterly silent, blow.
224353: A rattling, rustling hiss courses back and forth here. It reminds you
of... what? Perhaps the sound of the wind in the dry grassy plains, back
wherever they are. If so, the wind itself is a distant high wail to the
northwest; a deep rumble is barely detectable to the west; and a cacophony of
shrieks and brassy calls pours from the northeast.
224607: The sound seems to endlessly circle -- a gust to one side; a surge
approaching the other, then slacking.
224832: is not like anything you've heard. It's a mixture of brassy monotone
blares -- trumpets, perhaps -- and painfully high squeals, with fainter growls
and snarls underneath.
225041: A steady, deep, and powerful rumble burns just below the surface of
this spot. You feel it more than hear it -- a colorless vibration behind your
ears and in your bones. A much higher, keening wail is audible far to the
northeast, and from the east comes a rushing hiss.
225239: The rhythm is steady but in an odd pattern: thud, thud; thud, thud;
thud, thud. It seems to be coming from
225449: A gentle, irregular thudding sound comes from the dark air.
225503: The monotonous grumble permeates the air, and your blood.
225966: The incessant dripping is strongest that way. Its force, particularly
combined with the low plooping that moves with you, threatens to overwhelm you.
You back away.
226145: A metallic plopping sound resonates here, over and over again, in
several pitches and at several rates. You could easily believe that you were
surrounded by dripping fountains, although the ground underfoot seems to be no
damper than usual for this place. Bells jangle somewhere to the south, and
226641: The sound echoes all around you. To the northeast, it is louder and
more rapid,
226815: The sound echoes all around you.
227009: Voices seem to surround you, but you cannot make out the words, or even
determine whether the language is one you understand. A rapid sound of dripping
water comes from the southwest, and there are constant violent crashes to the
east.
227183: The murmuring of hundreds of voices comes from all around you. They're
not speaking to you, you feel fairly sure.
227297: A voice edges above the murmur, familiar -- Aessa? You cannot make out
what she said, if indeed that was her voice.
227394: You almost catch a phrase.
227697: The crash of shattering glass jars you, over and over, from somewhere
near here. Farther to the west you hear voices, apparently unconcerned; to the
south pulses
227863: The smashing noise is not constant; it repeats, each crash delayed just
long enough to make you think that perhaps it will not occur. The effect
scrapes your nerves bloody.
228048: inhumanly precise, though irregular, rhythm. Thud thud, thud, thud
thud, thud, thud thud, thud...
228233: The thudding that envelops you is quiet and very, very regular. Beyond
the pulse, dimly, you can make out smashing glass somewhere to the north. To
the southeast is a more immediate cacophony of squeals and blares.
228535: You take a step towards the hissing noise.
228575: There is a deafening blare, and something rushes right past your face,
horribly fast. More blaring calls and squeals erupt. You back away, hurriedly.
228685: Something strikes you a crushing, but utterly silent, blow.
228737: You are surrounded by the shrieks of the damned. Or something worse;
who knows what might lurk in this chain of worlds? Blares, squeals, and soft
snarling calls: all tear at your ears without respite. Infinitely more gentle
is the thudding sound far to the northwest, and a rattling, blowing hiss comes
from the southwest. And in the center of the noise, beside you, is a small area
of utter silence.
229031: It's unrelentingly horrible. Long, brassy notes blare out, at intervals
or overlapping -- they could be animal, human, or the calls of a cathedral's
pump-pipes. Above that are terrible rushing squeals, and a fainter chorus of
snarls and growls never ceases.
229223: It's exactly that -- a spot from which no sound comes, whatsoever. As
you move your head, the silence seems to press at you, unnervingly, and then
contract again.
229345: You reach into the silence, and in, in, with a sensation of going
infinitely and nowhere at all -- you pull back, shivering.
229439: There is a smell of rust about the silent area.
229578: as you move into it. Now all sound is gone from the world, the black
world, and the ground is gone, and your voice and your breath and you --
229684: -- Out of nothing, you are struck, hard, in the back and neck and
knees. There is no down, but a moment of dizzying instability rushes past you.
Then you are struck again, by a metal floor which jars your forearms painfully;
you flung up your hands just in time.
229873: You lie there for a moment, then push yourself up -- and crack your
head on the ceiling. Ohh. You curl around more carefully.
230047: Something moves overhead, on vast invisible wing-beats.
230095: You can hear something moving overhead, slowly, with a sound of heavy
beating wings.
230177: Whatever flaps above pays no attention to your voice.
230231: aupfxm up to the blind dark. There is no response from above.
230278: You can't even see it.
230336: I    odic  scu   ehm
A thing flaps slowly away into the silent dark.
230408: Something is approaching, high above you -- something with slow, heavy
beating wings.
230487: The chord is sustained and inhuman. It vibrates mercilessly in your
bones.
230592: . There's something hurtfully pure about the sound
230769: You essay a few notes, holding the box close to your mouth. The sound
is immense: a resonant thrum, echoing you in harmonics that shift subtly with
your voice.
230907: in harmony with your note. A white pain flashes across your eyes, and
then the chord is gone.
230994: You essay a few notes. The odd wooden box resonates slightly, producing
a faint thrum that shifts with your voice.
231077: Above you, the chord twists painfully, responding somehow to the box's
thrum. It seems weaker.
231176: You essay a few notes. The chord above pays no attention to your voice.
231239: You tap the box in several places; the resulting notes glance oddly up
and down the scale.
231306: Above you, the chord twists painfully, responding somehow to the box's
sound. It seems slightly weaker.
231433: The chord pays no attention to your voice.
231479: aupfxm up to the blind dark. There is no response from above.
231526: You can't even see it.
231600: You become aware of something thrumming; a bare high tone that thrusts
delicately behind your eyes. You shake your head, but it strengthens, becoming
a vibrating chord somewhere overhead.
231845: The chord is getting louder.
231886: The thrumming chord is painfully loud.
231933: The chord is throbbing agonizingly in your ears. Nothing seems to shut
it out.
232003: The thrum is like continuous lightning through your mind. You don't
notice when your legs give way; and then the darkness seems to shatter into red
needles.
232230: You brush the floor about yourself, and find nothing. But your reach
compasses so little of this boundless dark space.
232325: You feel the hard, damp surface below you. It's not quite smooth.
232461: You kneel and press an ear to the ground. Silence. Or -- that might be
the faintest echo of a dying tone, endlessly descending, running down -- and
it's --

You stand up and shake your head, until you convince yourself that you
no longer hear it.
232721: Don't make me laugh.
232743: In your position?
232930: The ceiling is quite solid.
232964: You sweep your fingers across the ceiling, and find nothing.
233013: The metal is cool, and very slightly damp.
233122: The floor is quite solid.
233162: You already are on the floor.
233196: You brush the floor about yourself, and find nothing. But your reach
compasses so little of this boundless dark space.
233285: The metal is cool, and very slightly damp.
233431: You crawl through the blind, heavy dark.
233473: You crawl for a time; nothing varies.
233518: You crawl for a few moments; and you are startled to find yourself
approaching the spot you just left.
233599: You crawl for a few moments, and once again the spot you left behind
appears ahead.
233745: aupfpm. The view through it is circumscribed, but not otherwise
enlightening.
233953: You can't hit something with itself.
233991: The pipes shriek painfully against each other, far louder a sound than
their impact should produce. You hastily mute them, and rub your aching
temples.
234103: The pipe says "Hey, cut that out!" [BUG]
234162: The pipe says "I'm not at home, dweeb!" [BUG]
234226: The pipe says "I'm not at home, twit!" [BUG]
234278: The pipe blurs, and for a moment it seems to extend, vertically,
forever. You cannot breathe for the sound. The bounded world blurs vertically
as well, and the metal ceiling recedes into the distance...
234432: The boy's eyes seem to fade last of all. They watch you, full of
something you may never see again.
234519: The sound, and the pipe you struck, are gone.
234566: The pipe blurs, and for a moment it seems to extend, vertically,
forever. You cannot breathe for the sound. The bounded world blurs vertically
as well, and the metal floor recedes into the distance...
234729: The boy's sleeping face seems to fade last of all.
234771: The boy's eyes seem to fade last of all. They watch you, flat,
expressionless.
234844: The sound, and the pipe you struck, are gone.
235018: The texture of the metal is no different within the spots; they simply
glow, with a pale, mottled radiance. Your outstretched fingers would span one
easily, and one scantly.
235149: The spots are several yards apart.
235181: The spots are a couple of yards apart.
235215: The spots aren't much more than a yard apart.
235255: The spots are an arm's-length apart.
235289: The spots are less than an arm's-length apart.
235367: That appears to be part of the ceiling.
235401: The bright spots give off no heat.
235487: You run your fingers along one of the grooves. There's a hair-fine
sensation of motion, as if a splinter of wind had brushed your fingertips, but
you cannot tell what it is.
235615: The grooves sound an almost inaudible rhythmic beat.
235657: That appears to be part of the floor.
235700: Dropped and lost.
235775: You rest your fingers on a ridge. It is vibrating faintly, with a
rhymthic pulsing shock -- as if something was ricocheting along it, three times
a heartbeat.
235893: The ridges sound an almost inaudible rhythmic beat.
235935: That appears to be part of the ceiling.
235975: Two objects are resting on the ground here: two short lengths of silver
pipe, it seems, one wider than the other. Each has a bone handle protruding
from its side, near one end.
236111: The lines are no warmer than the metal they are set in.
236155: That appears to be part of the floor.
236191: There are three more lengths of silver pipe here, just like the ones
you found earlier. Two are narrow; one is wide.
236300: That appears to be part of the ceiling.
236350: A figure sprawls indifferently on its back a few feet away. His back;
it's a boy, raggedly dressed; young, you think, although it's oddly uncertain a
guess. He breathes steadily in sleep.
236492: The ragged boy is still curled, asleep, on the rusted floor.
236542: The ragged boy is huddled, arms wrapped around himself, staring at you
with hot intensity.
236614: The ragged boy is sitting nearby, staring off into the low distance.
236668: The ragged boy is huddled, eyes wild. He is clutching
236728: The ragged boy is sitting nearby. His mouth twists wryly as he turns
236808: The ragged boy is sitting nearby. He is rapt, staring at
236922: The boy is wrapped in worn shreds, bright long ago, now mostly grey.
His eyes and hair are dark; once again you find yourself unsure of his age.
237037: . The boy is asleep.
237062: The boy is staring at you with hot intensity.
237399: Wrapping his hands around the pipe, the boy turns away, shaking, hiding
the silver metal with his body.

Then he straightens, slowly. His eyes search
yours, pressing at the wall of understanding between you; they drop to the
length of pipe, and rise again. Moss-light shivers on the polished surface. And
-- very softly -- he lays the pipe down before you.
237712: The boy nods encouragingly.
237825: The boy is still sitting there, watching you, grinning openly. After a
moment, the expression slips; he sighs.
237936: The boy's hand clenches as you pick up the length of pipe. But his face
does not change.
238016: He's awake.
238076: Perhaps it was only the stirring of the air; the child is awake. He
sits crosslegged, hunched under the low ceiling, staring at you in wonder.
238193: Perhaps it was only the stirring of the air; the child is awake. A thin
hand darts out and snatches
238271: . The boy clutches the metal to his chest, staring at you wildly.
238361: He jerks away from you, hiding the pipe with his body.
238409: He twitches violently.
238496: The boy frowns. He makes a puzzled circular gesture, leaning closer.
238550: He shakes his head and sits back in confusion.
238600: He's asleep.
238620: He jerks away from you, hiding the pipe with his body.
238716: aupfxm, and back up at you. He shakes his head. He points at the
ceiling, or something beyond, and then spreads his hands, head tilted.
238826: The boy closes his eyes for a moment; and shakes his head.
238961: He shies away, reflexively.
239274: . The boy slips a syllable of protest, turns on his side, and huddles,
still asleep.
239355: The boy's eyes search you, desperately, and then over again more
slowly.
239423: The boy flops back abruptly on the metal floor. His face clenches for a
moment. He struggles for composure, slowly; then he sits up, smiles wryly,
gives an expressive shrug. His gesture includes this entire infinite, crushing
world.
239621: The boy plucks a bit of moss and eats it. He glances over at you and
gestures at the light-patched ceiling, mouth twisting with mixed resignation,
encouragement, and apology.
239749: The boy idly plucks a bit of moss and eats it.
239816: The boy smirks suddenly and waves a hand towards you. He turns, glances
back, and raises an eyebrow. Then he crawls off into the dimness... and,
immediately, is crawling back towards you, from the opposite direction. He
grins smugly and sprawls out on the metal floor again.
240171: He stares for a moment. He turns the pipe over, once, as if hoping
for... something impossible. His head seems bent by more than the rusty
ceiling.
240291: He stares for a moment; his eyes are wondering.
240404: Dark eyes catch yours. The boy holds out
240442: with a quirk-mouthed smile. You take it, wondering. He gestures vaguely
upward and shakes his head helplessly.
240549: The boy raises the length of pipe for a long moment, seemingly watching
the dim light gleam from it.
240630: The boy glances at you for just a moment.
240696: There's no need to start a collection.
240740: You scrape a bit of moss free. It glistens in your fingers, bleeding
light; in moments it has faded.
240820: The moss sizzles, and a savory odor spreads.
240884: The glowing moss actually doesn't smell bad. Thick, somewhat doughy,
like risen bread.
240954: You twist awkwardly, bending to the rusty floor, and the moss that
shines dimly there. A clump dissolves on your tongue. The juice is thin and
oily, belying the doughy odor, but it's not foul. Somewhat sweet.
241111: Just a bit of dead moss, somewhat browned.
241142: Just a bit of oozing, dead moss.
241180: The moss smells good -- a savory, roasted aroma.
241217: The bit of moss actually doesn't smell bad. Thick, somewhat doughy,
like risen bread.
241289: The moss dissolves on your tongue.
241319: It has a smoky, rich taste.
241345: The juice is thin and oily, belying the doughy odor, but it's not foul.
Somewhat sweet.
241442: The moss is moist.
241471: The bit of moss blackens, and scatters to grey dust.
241513: The bit of moss sizzles and browns, and a savory odor spreads.
241583: The shadow has no odor at all.
241620: The shadow bobs wildly as you move the jar towards it. The darkness
dodges sideways, seemingly alive. You push the jar farther forward, and the
shadow licks back towards you; vertigo rolls around you, and you pull back
hastily.
241831: The shadow bobs wildly as you move towards it. It leans sideways -- and
vanishes. You spin around; there it is, stretching from the spot you just
passed through, away from your dancing flame.
241968: The shadow remains steady as you move towards it, the light at your
back. The dark
242033: things begin to drop away. The confining metal planes recede, and you
expand in vast relief, and expand and dissipate and fade --
242258: You hang without support, and the depths below swirl with mist. Above
you, the sky is flat and grey
242340: . Shapes move slowly across it.
242529: You're not even sure what keeps you here. Best not to disturb it.
242615: You do not know what that means here.
242659: You don't dare.
242680: No one is listening.
242706: Everything ends above you, a flat featureless surface, and there is no
way to judge its distance.
242786: Within the sky, or behind it, shapes slowly evolve.
242870: But you cannot make them out.
242970: The greyness is silent.
242989: The grey sky is infinitely far above, or perhaps just beyond your
reach.
243050: The shapes above seem to blur.
243126: The shapes in the sky fade. No, they are around you -- a ring of
dimness that sweeps in from every direction, shrinking, coalescing before you.
The words echo this time: "Will you forgive me?"
243371: The shadows above you change. Again you see
243424: The shadows above you change slowly, hinting at meaning.
243474: There is nothing beneath your feet. Veils of mist move far, far below,
a slow dance of shape and shadowy color. Where the pale folds thin, you can
glimpse darkness, pierced with bright points. Stars, or moonlit waves... or the
streets of a city like your home. But the lights are terribly distant.
243695: A spot of black shadow lies on the mist.
243778: You don't dare.
243808: You have a faint impression of vast uproar deep in the abyss, thinned
to silence only by its distance.
243879: Whatever is below you is far out of reach.
243991: You have no idea how to begin.
244029: Your voice echoes back, distorted nearly beyond meaning:
244176: The ring does not react.
244215: The darkness has no substance.
244243: The plea still echoes around you.
244273: The ring is empty.
244400: Straining against intangible resistance, you cross the boundary of the
ring. It writhes suddenly and collapses inward --
244649: Something swoops past your head.
244682: There is no reply.
244703: The sphere has no substance. And it already circles you; it's yours, or
at least a companion, for the moment.
244837: You cannot quite hear anything.
244991: Once again, the thought of motion becomes motion; you slide downward.
The glowing sphere follows, circling your head quietly, even as your descent
speeds, becomes a plummet.... Mist whips past you; the wind roars; you cannot
breathe for it, and then the blackness swallows you, leaving silence and the
single light of the orbiting sphere --
245304: Something thuds into the sand at your feet.
245396: There is intense resistance. You cannot overcome it.
245570: . Nothing changes; but there is a faint resistance, a sense of effort,
like a dream of flying into the wind.
245775: . Nothing changes; but there is a faint acceleration, a sense of ease,
like a dream of sinking through still water.
246002: You stand on a hard grey plane; it stretches without variation around
you. The sky above swirls with distant mist.
246265: No one is listening.
246426: You have a faint impression of vast uproar in the heavens, thinned to
silence only by its distance.
246495: Whatever is above you is far out of reach.
246623: The ground is impenetrable and vaguely slick.
246799: You walk for a while. The last trace of color fades from the cube; and
you notice, a moment later, that no new objects are breaking the grey monotony.
247057: The ridges on the cube slowly shift, becoming more regular.
247110: The ridges on the cube slowly shift, becoming irregular again.
247163: The ridges on the cube slowly flatten away, leaving smooth shaded
stripes.
247226: The stripes on the cube slowly raise into angular ridges.
247275: The stripes on the cube slowly fade to a uniform brown.
247326: Bands of paler and darker brown slowly appear on the cube's surface.
247383: The cube's brown color slowly pales to tan.
247426: The cube's tan color slowly darkens.
247673: You can't balance anything on a pyramid.
247713: You can't balance anything on a cone.
247747: That's plainly not marzipan.
247834: You really are bored, aren't you?
247869: You can't balance anything on a sphere.
248009: aupfpm a push. It calmly rolls away, to the
248284: . It rolls away.
248610: A wide, square, open-topped box made of some shiny substance.
248910: Taken.
248994: A perfect cube made of some shiny substance.
249398: Taken.
249448: Taken. You are careful not to let
249768: Light sweeps in from all around, condensing, brightening into a ring
which hovers before you.
249850: A ring of translucent brightness hangs before you, horizontal, twin to
the dark ring you saw elsewhere. Edges seem to glitter within it in crystalline
array; you can make no sense of them.
249994: The white cube drifts back and forth before the ring, a few feet beyond
and above it.
250063: You have no idea how to begin.
250101: Your voice is absorbed into silence.
250128: The ring does not react.
250167: The brightness has no substance.
250197: The ring is silent.
250217: The ring is empty.
250246: The white cube swings into a slow midair oscillation before the ring.
250405: You step forward, against some invisible resistance. But the white cube
in your hands is pulled forward, instead; it jerks from your grasp.
250514: You step forward, against some invisible resistance. But something
scrapes, then sails past you, pulled ahead even as you are pushed back.
250622: Bracing against a sudden invisible attraction, you cross the boundary
of the ring. It writhes suddenly and collapses inward --
250721: Moments later, you are pulling yourself to your feet; pulling together
shreds of your thoughts; grasping frantically for speech and language, for the
distorted words of the white cube have come into focus at last...
250887: The words are what they have been from the beginning (and you feel
every shape in the world shift in its balance):
250986: Something drags at your limbs. You cannot move far.
251039: ehn
The white cube drifts slowly before you. Waiting.
251082: It's a large cube of some smooth, shiny white substance.
251134: It slowly moves back and forth before the ring of light;
incomprehensible sounds somehow echo from it.
251210: It slowly orbits before you; its plea echoes.
251279: You have no idea how to begin.
251311: Your voice echoes back at you, distorted into unknowable syllables.
251405: The cube does not react.
251452: Your voice echoes back at you, distorted into unknowable syllables.
251527: Your simple assent is overborne by a voice that echoes from you like
breaking stone:
251764: (Somewhere, rough metal bends at last, and bows towards smooth metal.
They touch, singing -- wire hangs slack between --)
251857: And the mists dissolve between light and dark; and the simple lights of
home blur and fade and are wiped away. As are you. As is everything.
251987: Your simple refusal is overborne by a voice that echoes from you like
weary stone:
252059: The cube shivers to silent dust. The band of light spreads out, away
from you, fading back into the eternal grey. And a distant darkness recedes
into the swirling mists. You gaze up into those mists -- every breath is an
ache in your chest -- and wait for a glimpse of the distant, simple lights of
home --
252309: Strange, distorted sounds echo from the cube as it moves.
252353: The plea still echoes around you.
252395: The cube is inalterable in its course.
252429: The substance is very smooth.
252486: Strange, distorted sounds echo from the cube as it moves.
252557: Strange, distorted sounds still swirl from the cube. The ring remains
impassive.
253202: A glass sphere rests in the sand. It's just the size of your cupped
hands, and a small male figure is visible within it.
253298: A ping-pong ball. You know what a ping-pong ball looks like. [BUG]
253369: The cover is neat brown leather, chased with a bit of silver leaf,
though that's mostly worn away.
253440: You turn a few pages; but the brush-stroked script is entirely strange.
Several pages show faces, clearly painted by the writer's hand. Their features
tell you nothing.
253566: It's a small oval box, ornately engraved with a pattern of leaves and
vines, top, sides, and bottom. The lid's seam is barely visible. The ivory is
yellowed with age, but clean and polished.
253708: Fine dry reeds are laced in a three-way weave, forming a human figure
-- not detailed, but quite lifelike.
253790: It's a silvery plaque, in a frame of the same metal. The frame is
etched with swirling, intricate designs; the plaque itself seems to be covered
by a tracery of frost.
253914: It's clear as water -- you've never seen such pure glass -- and
perfectly smooth; the strange sunlight glints only here and there, on a few
scratches. Within it you can see a finely-wrought figure: a man, nude, standing
with hands outstretched in pleading. He stands upon a delicate layer of
prismatic glints which is suspended within the glass.
254192: It's a large, rough-cut block of some dark wood. The faces are
splintered and cracked with the grain, and several knots twist the edges.
254344: It's a large cube of some shiny brown substance. The surface is covered
with parallel, irregularly spaced ridges.
254436: Hmm. It doesn't look any different now, but you're sure you felt
something.
254501: It's a large cube of some shiny brown substance. The surface is covered
with parallel ridges, evenly spaced.
254588: It's a large cube of some shiny brown substance. The surface is smooth,
but striped with alternating lighter and darker bands.
254687: It's a large cube of some smooth, shiny brown substance.
254738: It's a large cube of some smooth, shiny tan substance.
254787: It's a large cube of some smooth, shiny white substance.
254844: Wait, that's not how it was when you arrived.
254933: The lid will not loosen.
254957: It's already closed.
255131: Nothing rattles within the casket.
255172: The figure is hollow, as far as you can tell.
255213: The wicker surface yields stiffly.
255245: You cannot unbind the wicker weave.
255288: The metal is as burning-cold as if it had been in this world for
centuries.
255348: The frost doesn't melt. It must be a pattern in the metal.
255398: The frost doesn't soften under your fingertips. It must be a pattern in
the metal.
255462: You tilt the plaque, looking beyond the frosted surface. Light glints
among crystals, forming a distant face... your reflection? It doesn't look
quite like you. And the eyes are desolate.
255625: It's smooth-polished.
255649: Your fingers leave faint streaks on the glass.
255710: It's a light, fluffy tangle of some fiber. The strands are a bright
violet.
255770: You feel a light, fluffy tangle of some fiber.
255810: You massage the fuzzy mass, but your fingers encounter nothing but the
fiber itself.
255876: Strangely, the fiber refuses to ignite.
255910: You stretch the tangle taut; it springs back easily.
255966: The sounds around you are only slightly muted, and the fiber won't stay
in your ears, anyway.
256036: It makes little difference to what you hear, and the fiber won't stay
in your ears, anyway.
256119: You run your fingers lightly, avoiding splinters. The wood is as rough
as it appears.
256187: The wood won't catch, not even the splintered edges.
256249: The ridges are stylized, shallow angular planes.
256284: The substance is very smooth.
256314: Something about the idea makes you uneasy.
256374: Something seems subtly different about the cube, as it moves.
256429: You turn the cube slowly back and forth.
256476: You turn the cube slowly back and forth; and, yes, it changes very
slightly as it moves.
256988: There is a faint tension as you move it towards the ring.
257029: Nothing seems to happen.
257066: Taken. It's surprisingly heavy.
257120: The brown cube seems to shift in your grasp.
257226: At the moment, "it"
257759: You reappear where you were. Boom. Yecch. [BUG]

259914: Well, there's a story. Read it how you like. If you come to any
conclusions, or even any interesting guesses, please email me. I'm curious to
know how well it worked.
260037: A few details:
260052: I don't know what's behind any of the locked doors, either. Email me if
you find out.
260379: . Imagine that latter one arched over a trench, and you've got the
castle bridge precisely.
260499: opm (Salem House, 1988.) It's a science fantasia about how life on
Earth might look today, if it hadn't been for that nasty meteor, or plague, or
alien hunting squad, or whatever it was that made such a mess 65 megayears
back. In particular, look at his crested sprintosaur (a grazing herd animal
descended from the "duck-billed" hadrosaur), and the northclaw (a hunting
theropod, also from the grasslands.) I didn't try to describe exact copies of
those animals, but I stayed fairly close.
260856: If you want a better idea of what the green rod smells like, find some
cardamom. It really does smell blue. (A sort of greeny-blue, as opposed to
fresh cilantro, which smells bright blue.) The rod tastes like cardamom, too,
but the spicy aftereffects are much more like candied tamarind. (Recommended!)
261075: For those two or three of you who didn't recognize the poetry fragments
behind the bells: it's Edgar Allen Poe. Phil Ochs did a great setting of that
poem to music, and I had it stuck in my head the entire time I was programming
that world. I figured I should inflict it on the rest of you, as revenge.
261292: "Who has seen her, following the wind?" This is the first line of the
poem "The Ghost Lover," by Rosemary Kirstein, quoted in her book
261478: Although there is, of course, no real score in this game, it is
possible to get one point. I'll be impressed if anyone does it, even with a
story-file text dumper. (No fair actually disassembling.)
261623: And, finally, a proverb:
261650: I hope I've written on yours.
261754: Much as you love curses, this is no time to practice your blasphemy.
261818: A hollow voice says, "Christminster."
261850: That's not a verb I recognise.
261895: But it's dark.
261913: Let's not start feeling paranoid.
261948: You can't.
261959: You find nothing of interest.
262007: There's nowhere to swim here.
262170: You vent your frustration.
262211: You wave, feeling foolish.
262234: You give yourself a hearty round of self-congratulation. You feel
better now, if slightly embarrassed.
262368: Respectful, but useless.
262404: Grasses rattle gently.
262421: You hear nothing unexpected.
262463: The air is hot, close, and chokingly humid.
262501: The air is cool, brisk, and rich as pepper sauce.
262543: The air carries mild spring fragrances, with a hint of the distinctive
reek of human civilization.
262617: The air is dry, without much smell.
262649: Winter ice claws your nostrils.
262685: The air is damp; you smell mud, faintly.
262749: The air smells unlike anything.
262777: The air smells unlike anything.
263258: Arson won't improve matters.
263286: As they say, wishes don't light candles.
263351: Such force seems unnecessary.
263374: There is no response.
263399: What a self-referential idea.
263422: Nothing happens.
263466: That isn't tied.
263540: You can't.
263561: There's nothing there.
263580: This would not be useful.
263610: You need to be holding it before you can put it behind something else.
263698: You can't.
263709: This would not be helpful.
263790: Hot, foul, and dark. How did indoor theater become so fashionable? Well
enough in spring rain or winter, but not in the thick, dead afternoon of high
summer. And though
264034: Damn the crowd, in truth: your mood was hot, foul, and dark when you
sat down. Aessa was supposed to meet you here. She's made excuses before, and
you don't think about what it might mean. Try not to think, rather. Just watch
the story. One of your favorites. But it's miserably hot, and you just aren't
caught up in the play...
264290: The sun's glow has faded in the west of the sky. The crowd outside the
theater shifts, murmuring; you push a little forward, out from under the
theater portico. A hot, crowded evening to a hotter, crowded day. But is that
the start of a breeze? You fan yourself hopefully with the paper in your hand
-- a playbill for
264731: Someone is standing there, a few paces ahead, rapt in the sky. Curve of
chin. Long hair, black in the moonslight. To hell with the theater. Dawn is
distant yet, so you move nearer to her, into the first cool smoky breeze of
autumn.

players should type "about".)
265368: You can't go that way.
265496: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
265528: As good-looking as ever.
265584: You can't go that way.
265602: The gale tears at your blanket.
265632: Your blanket only blunts the icy wind.
265662: The quiet chill still seeps through your blanket.
265712: Your ears are, fortunately, not within your field of view.
265768: Just you, as usual.

265944: There are many, many people in here, and they're all just as hot and
sticky as you. None of them, as well as you can see, are Aessa.
266048: The stage is left with a tumult of flowers and ribbons, the favors
thrown by the audience.
266120: The back wall of the theater is that way.
266152: You're at the top of the aisle.
266176: He looks old enough to have scrubbed bloodstains in the Calamoscan
Cyclia in his youth. And, if so, he's still annoyed at the slaves for having
bled so much.
266288: It's a rag. It's seen a lot of bench, but that doesn't make it
interesting.
266344: People flock here, in the shade of the colonaded portico, talking and
drinking sharp beer. The main entrance to the theater is back north; the street
runs bright and dusty to the south, and the crowded portico continues to the
west.
266512: A servant, looking terribly uncomfortable in dark formal garb, blocks
your way. "Can't let yar back in. They'll be setting up for another show after
sundown. Sorry, sar."
266640: The wall of the adjacent building stands in your way.
266680: The theater entrance is north.
266704: People stand around the portico, talking, drinking, avoiding the
dreadful afternoon sun, if not the heat.
266792: The kegman's stand is in your way.
266824: There's no way in there.
266848: The kegman is selling sharp beer in cheap clay flasks. You see quite a
few being tilted and expansively waved around the crowd.
266936: It's just a plain doorway, leading into the relative dimness of the
theater. A small sign by the jamb reads "By right, please."
267032: The sign reads "By right, please."
267064: This is obviously a service hallway for the theater. You are surrounded
by crates and arbitrary stacks of paper, and pieces of scenery lean against the
rough planking walls of the hallway to the north. Light glares in from the
south.
267224: The hall runs north and south.
267248: The cool air is definitely coming from the north, up the hallway.
267296: The hallway ends at a heavy door to the north, and a storage room opens
west. The wooden planking of the walls is old and unpainted; you notice a
narrow crack to the east. The heavy door is closed.
267440: The hall runs south; there's a door to the north and a doorway to the
west.
267496: Just a door, in heavy oak, with a wrought-metal handle. The door is
closed.
267552: The cool air breathes from the western doorway.
267592: It's a bare fingerwidth across and perhaps a yard long; just a gap
where the wall planks have warped.
267664: Or perhaps ex-storage, since the room is almost bare. A small dirty
window to the west admits bright beams, but they fall across only the floor and
a battered cabinet against the north wall. The doorway lies to the east.
267824: The doorway lies to the east.
267848: This part of Tertuga has borne the silent vise of high summer sun for
weeks. But, in the heart of a city baked to dust, this room has the tang of a
smoky autumn wind. You don't know what it means; but the breeze is coming
from... behind the cabinet?
268032: Beams of sunlight filter in through the window. They cut bright
rhombuses onto the floor, and onto the cabinet, leaving dark shadow behind it.
268136: The glass is old and wavery, and streaked with dirt and cobwebs
besides. Nonetheless, sun scorches in. Outside you see the avenue that crosses
by the theater; beyond that tower the columns of the rijusticas.
268312: The box is strange, even stranger for being so simple. Just polished
wooden sides, trapezoidal, no two faces parallel. But the joinings are precise;
no seams show. The craftwork is exact. No mark shows on the rich reddish wood,
except for the natural grain; and also a row of paler circles on each side.
These seem to be inlaid discs of a blond wood, flush with the surface, each
incised with a deep star-shaped mark.
268608: The discs are each about as long as the last joint of your thumb. They
are arranged in precise rows of three discs each, one row on each face of the
box. Each disc is incised with a mark in the shape of a three-pointed star.
268764: The sky is almost violet, infinitely distant -- you've never seen such
a sky, and without the haze of metallic heat that summer should have. But the
wind is sharp and chilly, and the trees nearby are a quilt of orange, red, and
gold.

Beneath you the road is old, filled with weeds and ragged moss; dirt
shows only in patches. To the south, the track is choked with trees, as it runs
into the fringes of an autumn forest. It continues the other way, though,
towards an immense stone wall that hems the northern horizon.
269136: The road runs north and south.
269160: You approach the forest, but underbrush has grown across the road and
young trees are springing up in it. After pressing a few yards farther, the
effort becomes too much, and you retreat.
269296: The road was wide once, you think, but weeds fill the ruts and push in
from the edges. A smooth moss has covered most of what must have been bare
dirt.
269408: The forest is thickly dappled with autumn color -- color which you
should not see for months yet, and never so rich, not in the southern climate
where you live. (But you are already certain that you are elsewhere.) The trees
are thick as well, old and crowded, choking the road that disappears into them.
269624: A worn stub of brick juts up here, by the road. It's no more than twice
your height; but scattered bricks in the weeds attest to an imposing chimney in
time past. Whatever building the chimney served is now just rotted scraps of
wood and a few stony ridges, and some mounds off to the west. The road
continues towards the wall north, and the distant forest south.
269880: The road runs north and south, and vaguely artificial hummocks stand to
the west.
269936: Most of the chimney is fallen; only a ragged angle remains, casting its
shadow far out into the afternoon weeds. Weathered bricks lie uncaring in the
grass below. They've been there a while, and they're not moving soon.
270104: The road was wide once, you think, but weeds fill the ruts and push in
from the edges. Just about all of what's left is covered with a smooth olive
moss.
270216: Stony ridges and low, overgrown mounds are visible in the meadow to the
west.
270272: This was probably a building once. Those ridges lie straight and at
right angles; the rotted logs are tumbled too close to be natural. Nothing but
field, now. A few mounds by the foundation were probably something once;
although a bright vine on one catches your notice. The broken chimney to the
east marks the old road.
270504: Once you push much beyond the old foundations, the meadow plants turn
thick and tangled. It's not worth the effort.
270592: They're obviously long left to decay. But you don't find much else of
interest.
270656: Grassy things and things with leaves. You're no expert. But the shades
of green are pretty, sweeping in slow waves with the spicy autumn wind.
270760: The mounds are just a few feet high, and overgrown; it's hard to tell
what was down there. But a strikingly yellow vine crawls over one of them.
270864: The wall stands that way.
270888: The wall stands that way.
270912: The road was wide once, you think, but weeds fill the ruts and push in
from the edges. Just about all of what's left is covered with a smooth olive
moss. The road runs up to the gate in the wall.
271048: There's nothing much in that direction.
271080: The wall stands that way.
271104: It's no different here. Forty feet high, close-fitted stone.
271160: The pillar rises through hollow dimness, lit only by the daylight
pouring through the hatch at your feet. Far above, a few needles of light show
that the top of the pillar is decaying as badly as the rust-eaten walls around
you. A set of narrow rungs ascends.
271344: You are at the bottom of the shaft. The floor seems to be some wet
stony substance, but it is even with the ground outside.
271432: You can only climb up or out.
271456: You cling to the rungs at the top of the metal shaft. The walls are
miserably corroded, and there are several rust-edged holes around you. The roof
above you is solid, but it is not metal; it's an odd black substance. It's also
heavily overgrown with yellowish vines that crawl in and out of the pillar.
271672: The holes are too small to fit more than a hand through. The only way
out is the hatch far below.
271744: This is as high as the pillar goes, as high as the ladder goes, and
really much higher than you wanted to go.
271824: There are several irregular rusty holes near the top of the pillar.
There's also one which is obviously meant to be there; the cable runs out
through it.
271936: The top of the pillar is sealed with a cap of some smooth black
substance. You can't tell much about it, but the vines have nearly covered it.
272040: The cable hangs down only a few feet, to a frayed, ragged end. It's
wrapped several times around the great pulley; and from there, it leaves the
pillar through a small gap to the north. Outside, you can see that the cable
runs across a yard of empty space to the top of the stone wall. There it passes
into the metal track which descends this face of the wall.
272304: It's a thick block, not perfectly rectangular; the edges are a bit
lumpy. The dim light brings out hints of hammer marks in the surface. The slab
is nearly as wide as the shaft, although there's room to stand in front of it.
Spliced to the top is a metal cable; it lies in untidy loops across the slab
and spills onto the ground.
272544: The cable is about thirty feet long. One end is spliced to itself
through a hole in the slab; the other is just a frayed end. The cable spills
loosely across the ground.
272664: There's nothing much in that direction.
272696: The wall stands that way.
272728: The pillar rises through hollow dimness, lit only by the daylight
pouring through the hatch at your feet. A set of narrow rungs ascends the
rust-touched wall of the shaft.
272848: You are at the bottom of the shaft. The floor seems to be some wet
stony substance, but it is even with the ground outside.
272936: You can only climb up or out.
272960: You cling to the rungs at the top of the metal shaft. The walls are
somewhat corroded, mostly beneath a small hole in the north side of the pillar.
The roof above you is solid, but it is not metal; it's an odd black substance.
273120: The hole is too small to fit more than a hand through. The only way out
is the hatch far below.
273192: This is as high as the pillar goes, as high as the ladder goes, and
really much higher than you wanted to go.
273272: There's a small gap in the north wall of the pillar; the cable runs out
through it.
273336: The top of the pillar is sealed with a cap of some smooth black
substance. You can't tell much about it.
273416: They're just curved metal rungs. They're not wide, but they're wide
enough, and they're spaced much as any other ladder you've come across. The
metal is rough and rusted; but it seems firm.
273560: The wall stands, massive and unyielding, to the south. The road issues
from its open gate, though, and leaps merrily over a rise to the north, and
beyond it. Ivy-wound towers are visible, somewhere at the road's end.
273720: The road leads north and south.
273744: This side is the same as the other. Forty feet high, close-fitted
stone.
273800: Slender, ivory towers are visible beyond the rise, to the north.
273848: A dawn-tale, ivory castle stands far to the north, heavily strung with
ivy and reddening sunlight. The road runs towards it, and back to the south,
over a hill that hides the stone wall. A branch of the road also leads
northwest, towards a dome, which seems to float in a magenta lake.
274048: The road leads north, northwest, and south.
274080: A large pile of pipes and cable is sprawled untidily by the road.
274128: The pipes are of various lengths, most longer than your body, though no
thicker than your wrist. The metal cables run in and out of their open ends.
Everything is heavily stained with rust, and a few of the cables seem to be
broken.
274296: The castle is delicate and graceful; its ivory-white stone gleams
beneath a carpet of vines. There seems to be a moat circling its base.
274392: You cannot see much detail; it's a low, wide dome, shining grey,
perhaps wood or polished stone. It's surrounded by what looks like a magenta
pool. Perhaps not, though; the color fades into the surrounding green, rather
than ending at a sharp bank. You really can't tell.
274592: The main road ends here, at the edge of a deep dry moat. Or nearly dry;
a trickle of dark water crawls past jagged rusty edges of iron, far below. A
broad stone arch spans the trench, up to the ivy-choked facade of the castle. A
smaller road follows the moat's curve, east and west.
274792: The main road leads south; the lesser roads run east and west, along
the trench; and the bridge is north.
274872: The bridge is as wide as the road. Low stone walls curve along its
edges. It ends at the castle gate, beyond the moat.
274960: The plates are undoubtedly meant to discourage invaders. Or... no. They
look, indeed, more as if they're meant to maim and kill invaders.
275064: This gentle, broad arch curves above the castle moat. It meets the road
at the south bank. The north end widens directly into the castle gate -- or
would, if the gate were not entirely blocked by masses of tangled vine. You can
see no way through.
275240: Green ivy tangles and knots across the gate. You push aside a few
vines, but nowhere near enough to make any progress.
275328: The castle rears into the sky, immense yet still graceful. Ivy vines
entwine it even more thickly than you saw from a distance; green runs up the
towers and dangles into the moat, and the ivory-white stone peeks out in ten
thousand fringed gaps. A gate stands at the north foot of the bridge, but the
ivy curtains it entirely.
275560: The plates are undoubtedly meant to discourage invaders. Or... no. They
look, indeed, more as if they're meant to maim and kill invaders.
275664: The road curves around the east side of the castle, edging the trench.
To the north, it falls into the shade of trees; forest has grown down to the
castle's north edge.
275784: The road runs north and south here.
275816: There is no way across the moat here.
275848: Once within the forest, the road is rapidly overgrown with greenery and
small trees. You turn back.
275920: An unmarked brass lever rises from the stone lip of the trench.
275968: The forest is thickly dappled with autumn color -- color which you
should not see for months yet, and never so rich, not in the southern climate
where you live. The trees are thick as well, old and crowded, choking the road
that disappears into them.
276144: The road curves around the west side of the castle, edging the trench.
To the north, it falls into the shade of trees; forest has grown down to the
castle's north edge. A smaller road branches off towards a dome that squats to
the southwest.
276320: The road runs north, south, and southwest here.
276360: Once within the forest, the road is rapidly overgrown with greenery and
small trees. You turn back.
276432: An unmarked brass lever rises from the stone lip of the trench, just by
the base of the pile of pipes.
276504: The mosaic paving is every shade of scarlet and grey, a shocking
contrast to the castle walls, the ivory stone which was all that was visible
from the ground beyond the moat. Even the ivy that chokes the walls above and
below you does not venture far onto the colored tiles. A small arch would lead
east into the castle, were it not entirely filled with vines. To the west, wild
ruffling meadows spread under the violet sky; the dome is visible to the
southwest, in its magenta stain of lichen.
276848: The arch, and as far as you can tell the space beyond, is knotted and
tangled full. You push aside a few vines, but nowhere near enough to make any
progress.
276960: There is only the blocked arch east, and the bridge west.
277000: The tiles are in bold reds and greys, really quite unnerving in this
rural world. But the patterns are abstract, just jagged, sharply-angled strips
and rhombuses.
277120: The bridge is a spacious webwork, but its shadow is a solid black span
across the grey and red tiles. Something glitters at the shadow's edges...
frost?
277240: Shades of green roll over and over in the breeze.
277280: The castle rears into the sky, immense yet still graceful. Ivy vines
entwine it even more thickly than you saw from a distance; green runs up the
towers and dangles into the moat, and the ivory-white stone peeks out in ten
thousand fringed gaps. There is an open arch to the east, but the ivy curtains
it entirely.
277504: The dome rises to the west, without looming; its curve is gentle. A
rough arch leads within. The dome's surface is a polished brown-grey, a bit
mottled, and the whole structure is very slightly irregular; a homey,
reassuring effect. The ground beneath you is a shocking contrast. Bright lichen
covers everything with magenta tufts; there's not a blade of grass or stick of
shrubbery within fifty yards of the dome. The olive-mossed roads are the only
relief; they run northeast, towards the castle, and southeast.
277872: The roads lead northeast and southeast, and the dome is west.
277920: A smooth, dark olive moss covers most of the road. Very smooth, in
fact. The few patches of bare dirt are more eroded.
278008: You've never seen anything like it. A crusty, raggedly tufted growth
spreads for tens of yards around the dome, and it's a searing-bright magenta.
The slanting sunlight makes streaks and shadows of it; your eyes hurt. You do
notice, though, that the patch stretches considerably farther west of the dome
than it does east.
278240: The road was wide once, you think, but it's rutted now, and lichen
pushes in from the edges. A smooth moss has covered most of what must have been
bare dirt.
278352: The dome is perhaps seven or eight yards high, and three times that
across at the base. The sides slant sharply inward even at ground level, and
they rise in a smooth curve to the dome's broad cap.
278488: The eastern arch leads outside, and other doors are northwest,
southwest, and west.
278552: A thin cord dangles from the dimness; a decorative little bob adorns
its end. It hangs near the tiled depression, at about shoulder-height.
278656: The plants grow in large blue ceramic pots. Most are somewhat pallid
and spindly, in this dim chamber, but each one has a single fuzzy white blossom
crowning its stem.
278776: They're plain, blue-glazed pots. All pretty much the same. Each one has
a plant in it.
278840: The door is just a door. It has a keyhole by the handle.
278880: It's a decaying stem, all that's left of the flower you picked from the
plant-pots.
278944: A cloud of vapor, barely visible, hangs about one of the plants.
278992: The hatch leads east. It's standing open, so the hatch cover itself is
lying against the wall in the next room.
279080: . They swell visibly as you watch.
279112: It's a bulging pod, about the size of your fist. The reddish skin
glistens just a bit.
279184: Aagh!
279192: Whummp!
279200: The east pillar stands nearly as high as the wall, a bit rusty. You can
make out a cable running from its top to the top of the east gate-track.
279304: You really have no idea what it is. A worn shard, no longer than your
finger. The surface is dirty and weathered, and scored by the vine's roots, but
you can see that it was once brilliant blue. And it's no material you know;
much too light to be metal or wood, and slightly flexible. Perhaps some kind of
horn or bone. But the blue color isn't just a surface stain.
279568: Bricks are the same everywhere.
279592: Weeds are pushing in from the sides of the road, and a smooth, dark
olive moss covers most of what remains. Very smooth, in fact. The few patches
of bare dirt are more eroded.
279736: You are alone to the east of a long wooden platform. This must be the
back, for a slat fence runs around this small field, enclosing you, assorted
rolls of canvas, and a small mountain of hay bales. A small closed gate breaks
the fence to the north. The sun is bright, but the air is mild and
fertile-scented.
279952: The fence surrounds all directions but north and west.
279992: Several long rolls of canvas are stacked in a corner of the field.
There's nothing very remarkable about them.
280072: The fence begins and ends at the corners of the platform, sealing this
area off, but for the closed gate to the north. It's of board slats bound in
wire, and a little higher than you.
280200: The hay is baled in massive blocks, bound with coarse twine, breathing
sweet dusty warmth. And... a touch of smoky coolness, too. You look for and
find the night-black behind the hay bales: the shadow you stepped out of when
first you came between this springtime land and its sky.
280400: The shadow of the hay bales lies on the grass, black, impossible, and
real. You wonder how you can be not even surprised, anymore.
280504: It's dried grass.
280520: The platform is surrounded by a low fence, except to the southwest.
280568: It's just a low railing.
280592: The yard is fenced on that side.
280616: The arch is a slender curve of golden brick, light and wide. It flies
over the road, unrepentantly, for its own sake.
280704: It's galloping madly from you, head down, crest sticking up.
280752: A low railing surrounds the arena, except to the south.
280792: The three are wearing dull clothing, just dirty grey wraps and
breeches. They're carrying brooms, spades, and sacks, and they're carefully
tidying the earth of... well, the usual mess. They do not speak; in fact, they
never even look up from their work.
280976: The doors lead north and south.
281000: You see the yard outside to the north.
281064: Splash.
281080: You force an objective stance upon your stomach, and examine the dead
animal. The wounds are claw marks. Undoubtedly the clawed creature you...
unhh... you turn away.
281288: A busy crowd surrounds you, here in the sun. Spacious brick buildings
line the square; a road runs east, a path leads west under a wide arch; and to
the south the plaza continues, a stream of cobblestone, trees, grass-cuts, and
lively people. Lively, but... quiet. Feet moving, smiles, waving hands, but not
one voice. It feels too normal to feel odd. In the center of the cobble circle
that forms this end of the mall, a statue rises from sprawled shrubbery.
281616: There is no entrance to the buildings in that direction.
281712: The statue is of some black marble, veined in red and gold. A tall man,
larger than life, faces south down the plaza; but he is not looking to the
horizon. His eyes are lowered; his expression pensive, turned inward. A hint of
bitterness quirks his lips.
281896: Spacious brick buildings line the square; there are entrances north and
southwest.
281960: A busy road runs west, towards the plaza, and east, towards a tall
tower that gleams whitely in the distance.
282064: The light is dim after the bright plaza.
282120: The crowded mall stretches north and south, a cheerful bustle of
people, trees, benches, and grass. The hush of the crowd is merely restful.
Ornamental building facades stand along the sides of the plaza, although a dark
and narrow alley slips between brick walls to the east.
282320: There is no entrance to the buildings in that direction.
282360: The alley is narrow and deep, but the late sun falls square along it.
Something stands motionless in the light at the far end.
282448: Benches stand here and there on the edges of the mall. They're simple
slabs of rough sandstone, and people are smoking, gesturing in groups, dozing,
and simply sitting on one and many of them.
282584: The cobble way from the north ends here, at a broad tree-lined square
which runs down to a gentle river. Smaller roads runs east and west, along the
water's edge. In the center of the square is a marble pedestal. Silent people
stand and flow around the mall, animated or relaxed.
282840: The river runs along the south edge of the square.
282880: There is no entrance to the buildings in that direction.
282920: Buildings line the square. There is an entrance to the northeast.
282968: You can't make out much in the park besides the flagpole; even that is
partially hidden, and you can't see the top or its flag, if indeed there is
one. But you do recognize the inky shadow that streaks the grass at the pole's
foot. Stranger than that are the people moving through the park: though sound
doesn't carry beyond the hedges, they seem to be laughing and talking.
283232: The light is dim after the bright plaza.
283288: A busy road runs west, towards the plaza, and east, along the river.
283368: A busy road runs east, towards the plaza, and west, along the river.
283448: Blank walls stand close, all ways but west. The sun, hovering low over
the west horizon, shines almost directly into this alley; the brick walls are
streaked with the vivid scratchy shadows of their own roughness.
283600: This is a blind alley.
283616: Crowds teem silently to the west.
283648: The mall is dusted with small trees, each rising from a small plot of
gardened earth. The trees are spread wide enough to keep the mall whole and
clear, but close enough that one or two are always nearby. They are of several
kinds; many show spring flowers.
283928: The space is cool and half-shaded by frequent trees. Shaggy bushes,
untrimmed, surround the park, casting the aura of unspoiled wilderness. A river
peeps through shyly to the north, and a wider gap in the irregular rhythm of
hedges leads your eye west. In the center of the space rises a bare flagpole. A
few people stroll here, chatting quietly or simply walking.
284184: You walk to the gap between the hedges, and find the river at your
feet. The shrubbery grows right to the water's edge; there's nowhere to go.
284288: You move behind a bush, and find another couple of bushes blocking your
way. There doesn't seem to be any way through here.
284384: This corner of the park centers around a grey stone pedestal. The
pedestal supports a large and curious sculpture, or construction -- or
something, made of metal columns and wire. Trees and bushes ring the pedestal,
granting it unspoken precedence in the quiet landscape. A path leads east
through the hedges. A few people stroll here, chatting quietly or simply
walking.
284648: It's an unadorned rectangular slab of some grainy grey granite. It's
just big enough for the construction which rests on it.
284736: There are perhaps two dozen wires, each running horizontally from one
outward-leaning column to the other. They are polished and twisted strands of
some black metal. The bronze disc hangs horizontally between two of them,
pinned to the wire just above it.
284912: The disc is nearly half a yard wide. A pin rising from its center
attaches to the midpoint of one wire; the disc hangs horizontally between the
columns, at belt height. A delicate tracery is etched on its upper surface... a
map? The shapes are nearly familiar... yes, the outlines of the continents, but
distorted, strangely flattened around the rim of the circle. And even by that,
not quite right. Some islands are too small, or missing. That peninsula should
continue across the southern ocean. Odd.
285288: They are of several kinds; many show spring flowers.
285328: The bushes seem wild, untrimmed. But you notice their foliage is
everywhere rich and healthy; and their pattern is ideal, making every nook of
the park private, without being isolated or hemmed in.
285504: The flame is no longer than the last joint of your thumb. It shoots
straight out from the broken corner of the square, a bright diagonal line: dim
blue at the base, but eye-stingingly bright along the rest of its length.
285656: It's just a small triangular chip, slightly rough where you broke it
from the ceramic square. The red dot is still visible on one side.
285752: Not a flat tame greensward, mind you; you are surrounded by wild,
waist-high, reed-yellow growth that hisses and rattles in the dry breeze. The
grasses roll to every cloudless horizon. Above you towers an immense tree --
the only one visible anywhere in this prairie world -- and its shadow slices
blackness past your feet. A path of flat, trampled grass cuts south down the
hill.
286024: From the top of the hill, everywhere is down.
286056: It must be visible for miles. The burly trunk is broader than your
shoulders; limbs splay out over most of the hilltop. Dense foliage shrouds its
branches. The tree's shadow is a line of utter black, thrown far across the
grass by the setting sun.
286248: You are sitting on a thick branch under the tree's dense green crown.
The hill and grasslands spread below you and off into the distance, for there
are no other branches nearby to block your view.
286384: There isn't another limb within reach.
286416: You're not agile enough to go clambering out on limbs.
286456: The tree is just as large when you're perched on it as it was from
below. Unfortunately, there are no higher limbs within reach.
286552: The shadow runs from the tree's roots, far into the east.
286600: You are on the south flank of the grassy hill. The flattened path runs
up the hill to the north, towards the towering tree, and also leads west. The
unconstrained grass spreads everywhere else.
286736: You are on the southwest edge of the grassy hill. The path hugs the
base of the hill, running east and north from here. A tiny clear rivulet
burbles from a crack in the earth, just off the path; it trickles away through
the grass to the west.
286912: The spring is barely a handspan wide, just a thread of water which
flows across the dry earth and is lost in the grass. The crack it comes from is
narrower than your finger.
287032: You are on the western face of the hill. It leans serenely above you,
with the sunlit tree alert at its crest. The flattened path runs north and
south.
287144: You are on the northwest side of the hill. The path runs south along
the hillside, but continues north into the open grassland.
287232: The man has pale hair, nearly white, and red lines are painted across
the corners of his eyes. He sits knee-bent; he'd be facing south, watching the
path, if he wasn't leaning blissfully sideways with his head propped on his
forearm. His other hand rests open on the ground, with the spear lying across
it.
287448: Startled, you stop what you were doing.
287480: It's a handsome weapon, a four-foot length of some polished red wood.
The point is a fluted leaf of black glass -- a smooth shape, not chipped into
shape. The spear is lying loosely in the man's hand.
287624: The knife is a simple slim blade in a handle of reddish wood. The blade
is the length of your hand.
287696: The jar isn't tilted, or cracked; the trickle seems to be oozing
straight from the clay, just above the smudge.
287776: All that's left of the jar is this scattering of pale potsherds.
287824: It's a clear liquid, just slightly thicker than water.
287864: A trickle of water oozes from the jar, apparently straight from the
clay, just below the lip. It drips down the side and falls steadily.
287960: The grass is an unending reach of tall, broad blades. Each is creased
lengthwise into a V. The stalks are dry and somewhat yellowed, and the wind
changes them to infinite rippling waves, and a sound like a distant rainstorm.
288128: He is not tall, but his limbs are wiry and long. He wears a tight brown
garment that leaves him free to move. His face is intense, with golden hair
above the black bar of paint that masks his eyes.
288272: She wears a tight brown garment that does not cover her arms and legs,
and she dances with abandon. Her white hair is bound into a queue, and a stripe
of white paint crosses her eyes.
288400: He is tall and thin, and dances with tight energy. He wears a tight
brown garment that leaves him free to move. His hair is sparse and grey, and
his face is covered with jagged crossing stripes of black and violet.
288552: She is tall, wearing a tight brown garment that does not cover her arms
and legs. Her shape is that of large pregnancy, but her movements suggest that
this is costuming, light padding. A stripe of grey paint crosses her eyes.
288720: The ground seems solid.
288744: The spire is twice your height; it juts alone from the bare and
unadorned snow, and there is nothing like it visible for miles. The wind has
carved it into a mad folly of curves and hollows. At the spire's foot, a
night-black shadow falls across the snow.
288936: You step to the lip of the crevasse. There's no going further without
going down, and you're most uncertain about that.
289024: Coward.
289080: Heh heh.
289088: Owww!
289096: Hold on a minute. I dare you to lick that pole.
289136: Come on, lick the pole. I double-dare you.
289168: I double-dog-dare you to put your tongue on that iron pole.
289216: Go on, lick it.
289232: I double-dog-dare you.
289256: The ground seems solid.
289280: The distant cliff runs across the western edge of the world. It doesn't
look very high, though distance may be deceptive. You're sure it looks lower to
the north, though. The sun is low enough to have set behind the cliff, and its
ragged top edge slices sunbeams into a long, wavered veil of light across the
sky.
289504: The sun is low enough, and the western cliff high enough, that you are
in the cliff's shadow. The world is dim and the snow grey. But the sky is still
brightly blue; it's not yet night.
289640: The sun is low enough to have set behind the cliff, and its ragged top
edge slices sunbeams into a long, wavered veil of light across the sky.
289744: You make a dedicated attempt, but the slope rises too sharply, and your
feet slip again and again on the snow-covered ice.
289832: Which way do you want to descend?
289856: There's a gleam of metal in the snow -- a twisted bit of rod, pronged;
perhaps a key of some sort.
289928: The key, if that's what it is, is only a few inches long. Three small
prongs spread from each end. They look as if they were meant to angle straight
out, symmetrically; but the rod is twisted, and the prongs bent and flattened.
290096: The drop is dizzying. Perhaps you should descend back north.
290144: The wind batters you back.
290168: Crack!
290176: Crack!
290192: It's constant, deathly strong, and cold.
290224: The ground seems solid.
290248: The cliff prevents you.
290272: The cliff prevents you.
290296: Large chunks of stone are piled at the base of the cliff, below the
cave. Their edges are raw and sharp, freshly broken.
290384: The tunnel is round, as you saw from the outside, and the walls are
smooth; a hint of groove curves around them. The passage recedes west, dimly,
though you can make out a hint of glow in the distance. A blinding blue and
white circle of outer world glares at you from the east. Somehow, the wind is
not blowing in, so the air is icily still.
290624: The tunnel runs west and east.
290648: You can't make out the source of the glow. It's soft, and very distant.
290704: The tunnel is very straight. You can tell that it's not quite
east-west, though; the distant bright spot of outside snow is more
east-northeast, and a strange watery glow is visible west-southwest.
290848: The tunnel runs west and east.
290872: It's the light at the beginning of the tunnel, far to the east.
290920: You can't make out the source of the glow. It's soft, distant, but
pervasive.
290984: The shape of the tunnel is the same, but you are surrounded by
translucent ice, here at the end. To the east the passage returns to the
dimness of stone. The west wall is an irregular sweep of ice; and it glows,
with what must be the setting rays of the sun, somewhere to the west. Ripples
of gold light fall through milky blue veils, turning this space into a small
still cathedral.
291256: The tunnel runs only east.
291280: The cave is walled with pure ice, but the western curve is a phantasm
of frozen, muted color and light. An indistinct shape is caught within it.
291384: Caught within the western ice is a dark, indistinct form. The glow
behind it casts a night-black shadow across the tunnel's floor.
291480: Pale light and ice veil its shape; you are sure only that it's been
still for a long, long time.
291560: The snow is dry, powdery, and actually quite a thin sheet. Only a few
inches down, it turns to iron-hard ice. The snow is tracked with the prints of
some large-pawed animal.
291696: The wind seems to be eternal, here. It's cold and sharp as metal, and
the sound that it shivers across the ice is the sound of utter patience.
291800: You stand on the east side of a wide circle of grey, glittering sand.
The sky is black; but it is not night, for the sun hangs above the western
horizon, a strange, fierce white dot that does not dim the stars around it or
the moons above. A familiar sky-black shadow lies at your feet, cast in dim
sunlight from a waist-high dome which stands at the center of the circle. The
sand is surrounded by a fence of sorts -- tall silver bars rise around you, a
roofless cage. And beyond that is nothing but endless barren plain.
292168: The dome is in your way.
292192: You can pass around the dome to the northwest or southwest.
292240: The sun, shrunken and sullen, casts a long shadow from the dome east
across the circle. A trace of frost whitens the sand, at its edges.
292344: The dome is in your way.
292368: You can pass around the dome to the northeast or southeast.
292440: It's a small mound of clean, grey sand.
292472: The ground is solid.
292488: In to what?
292504: Out from what?
292520: The rapping echoes louder, a percussive blow that sends you stumbling
back.
292576: You would run into the teeth of the tintinnabulation.
292616: Hear the sledges with the bells... silver bells...
292656: What a world of merriment their melody foretells...
292696: To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells...
292736: From the jingling and the tingling of the bells.
292776: Hear the mellow wedding bells... golden bells...
292816: What a world of happiness their harmony foretells...
292856: What a gush of euphony voluminously wells...
292888: To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells.
292920: Hear the loud alarum bells... brazen bells...
292960: What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells...
293000: In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire...
293040: In the clamor and the clangor of the bells.
293072: Hear the tolling of the bells... iron bells...
293112: What a world of solemn thought their monody compels...
293152: Keeping time, time, time, in a sort of Runic rhyme...
293200: To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.
293232: The wail rises to a glass-edged shriek before you can complete a step.
293288: The rattling attenuates as you move that way. You freeze, vaguely
disturbed by the abrupt sense of echoing distance.
293376: As you begin to move that way, the rumbling scales abyssally downward
in pitch. You retreat quickly, before you are drawn with it.
293480: The incessant dripping is strongest that way, and its force threatens
to overwhelm you, until you back away.
293560: A particularly loud note, as of silver on steel, flays your thoughts
for an instant.
293624: The voices rise as you begin to move, and take on a definite tone of
hostility. Another step brings on an angry hub-bub. You move back, glancing
futilely around in the dark.
293752: You move towards the distant thudding sound. The gentle thudding around
you keeps pace, and the two rhythms blend imperceptibly.
293848: The irregular thudding draws closer, and louder. It's almost painful --
no, it is painful, the sound is jarring your mind; you back away.
293952: A particularly violent crystalline crash comes from just in front of
your feet. You flinch back, even though nothing touches your skin.
294048: The thudding becomes syncopated as you move that way. It grows more
irregular, dragging with it the rhythms of your body, pulling them off-true and
into a queasy weaknesss -- you retreat, quickly, while you can.
294264: It's just mud, packed and smoothed by a million passing feet... or
passing something. The surface is damp, but too hard to show your footprints as
more than another irregularity.
294392: You can see no way out.
294416: It doesn't get much more in than this.
294456: The ceiling is a bare sheet of metal, somewhat rust-stained.
294504: The floor is a bare sheet of metal, somewhat rust-stained.
294568: Tunnnggg....
294584: Tinnnggg....
294616: It's a length of silver pipe, the length of your hand, and not quite
wide enough to fit two fingers into. A carved-bone handle juts out; it's
fastened a quarter of the way along the length.
294768: It's a length of silver pipe, the length of your hand, and not quite
wide enough to fit your fist into. A carved-bone handle juts out; it's fastened
a quarter of the way along the length.
294904: The metal floor and ceiling seem a bit farther apart here -- at least,
you can nearly straighten your neck, from where you sit. The floor is scarred
by thin parallel grooves.
295032: Two spots of light shine palely on the ceiling.
295072: The grooves are barely wide enough to fit a thumbnail into. They are
spaced about an arm's-length apart.
295152: You are still kneeling between unyielding surfaces, much too close
above and below. Long parallel ridges cross the ceiling, perhaps an
arm's-length apart, and disappear into the darkness around you.
295296: The ridges are about the width of your finger. They seem to be pressed
directly from the metal above you.
295376: You sit hunched between parallel metal planes. Your chin is tucked down
and your head still pressed uncomfortably against the ceiling. Dim-glowing
traces on the floor stretch into the distance, however; low as it is, this
space seems vastly wide.
295552: The light comes from thin lines inset into the floor, a dimly
phosphorescent grid.
295616: The space between these plates is, if anything, fractionally lower than
the first one you fell into. A dim phosphorescent grid is traced out across the
ceiling, marking silent distance in all directions.
295760: The light comes from a grid of thin lines inset into the ceiling.
295808: The metal overhead bends you nearly double, even sitting, as you are.
Both floor and ceiling seem more heavily rusted here; small clumps of
phosphorescent moss cling here and there.
295936: Small clumps of moss shed a faint light, barely visible even from the
corner of your eye.
296000: You are lying full length on scarred, rusted metal. Your raised head
brushes the ceiling. Is it harder to breathe here? Don't think about it.
296104: A black outline stretches across the metal -- a shadow, cast by the
light of your flickering flame, from... nothing that you can see.
296200: The abyss-dark shadow does not reveal a form. It reaches far ahead of
you, shifting as the oil flame moves, but the spot it reaches from is empty.
296312: There is nowhere higher.
296336: a dark figure standing in an empty room. Its lips move, silently: Will
you forgive me?
296400: two silhouettes standing on a dark porch. They are talking, but they
are huddled somehow away from each other, and one will not look the other in
the eye. A third shape steps out for a moment nearby, and the two freeze, until
the third moves away.
296576: one silhouette walking slowly in a sunny park. It takes a side path,
and then another, seemingly without aim or direction. A dry tree branch tosses
idly in one hand; the figure does not speak.
296712: two silhouettes standing in a room; many others sit around them. The
two mouths are moving, soundlessly, and you see a stray foot tapping. The
audience is relaxed, laughing.
296840: three figures kneeling on pavement, around an arrangement of cards and
small shapes. One silhouette lays down another card and moves an angular shape
onto it. The other two sit back, frowning. One gropes for a jar and sips from
it.
297000: six silhouettes sitting in a circle, in a plush room. One is reading
out loud, from a book. It turns a page and passes the book to its right, and
that figure continues the reading. There is a distant air of solemnity, until
one reader grimaces, and seems to laugh ruefully. It begins again.
297208: several figures lying on trim grass, staring up into the sky. The
sunlight is somehow dim. One silhouette sits up, and seems to laugh, and points
at its own shadow.
297328: a dim figure sitting over a desk, pen in hand. It shuffles through one
sheaf of papers, then another; it picks up a book that is lying on the floor. A
few lines are scratched. The figure jumps up and walks in a tight circle,
waving its arms. Then it sits, writes another line or two, and so it continues.
297544: a silhouette standing in a small room -- a kitchen, full of jars and
untidy sacks. The figure mixes furiously, tastes from his bowl, shakes a bottle
over it, taps again to be sure. Peelings and shells pile up on the counter.
297704: two silhouettes walking slowly across a sunny park. Other shapes play
some game in the distance, but the pair pay no attention. They stop by a low
stone wall. A bird darts down, and lands on it, and eyes them fearlessly.
298192: A ring of translucent darkness hangs before you, horizontal, no broader
than your circled arms would be. A thousand fragmentary shapes might flicker
within the shadowy band; but they are all quite still.
298336: Crash.
298352: A softly glowing sphere orbits you slowly, a phantom of light. Within
it you see a ghost-figure of a woman.
298432: The sphere is just large enough to fit in your cupped hands, were it
solid, and not a soft luminance in the air. It moves around you, without a
whisper, passing before your eyes once in three heartbeats. And in the sphere's
heart stands the image of a woman. She is dressed simply, in a pale robe and
hairfall. She gazes out away from you. She does not move; but her hands are
outstretched, pleading.
298714: Something else catches your eye: there is a shadow upon the mist, far
below.
298776: At this distance, it's a mere spot. But it has the same night's-blood
darkness which has brought you this strange, far way.
298864: There is no way up.
298880: There is nowhere lower.
298912: Veils of mist move far, far above, a slow dance of shape and shadowy
color. Where the pale folds thin, you can glimpse darkness, pierced with bright
points. Stars, or moonlight on waves seen from the bottom of an invisible sea,
or the lights of some dawn-tale city in the sky.
299120: The ground is an opaque and featureless grey.
299152: A perfect four-sided pyramid made of some shiny substance.
299200: A perfect cone made of some shiny substance.
299232: A perfect sphere made of some shiny substance.
299280: Crash.
299288: "Ah, my love. Can you forgive me?"
299320: "How can I deny you? There is nothing to forgive."
299360: "How can I ever forgive you? There is nothing to forgive."
299408: It is too dark to see.
299528: It is too dark to see. The ceiling is still there, low and massively
solid, nonetheless.
299640: A Change in the Weather.
299680: The Outskirter's Secret.
299704: "The author should always write on the reader's nose."
