93588: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
93616: There's not enough water to swim in.
93644: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
93672: That would be less than courteous.
93696: Is that the best you can think of?
93720: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
93760: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
93792: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
94300: Try typing "showverb" and then the name of a verb.

94396: Entry in property list not routine or string: "
94516: " can only be used as a player object if it has the "number" property
94778: The suite your publisher's installed you in free of charge (within
reason, as you've discovered trying to order adequate dinners from Room
Service) till you get your goddamn book done.  Your deadline's three days away
and you haven't written a solitary word.  Not word one;  zippo;  nada city. 
Even if you could think of a word or (miracle of miracles) two you'd need to
sober up massively before you could enter it into your laptop.


Oh, the room? 
There's a bed that's been slept in way too often, unaltered by the housekeepers
since your last nap.  There's a hotel chain's idea of a workdesk, a doorway
into the bathroom at the southeast end of the room, a walk-in closet to the
east, the door to the hallway in the northwest corner.  Gillian your editor,
bless her heart, instructed them to remove the t.v.  A minibar stands on the
wall.

idea of a workdesk, a doorway into the bathroom at the southeast end of the
room, a walk-in closet to the east, the door to the hallway in the northwest
corner.  Gillian your editor, bless her heart, instructed them to remove the
t.v.  A minibar stands on the wall.
95668: The door to the hallway is chained, latched and double-locked (from the
inside).
95796: With the aid of the lamp you find and procure the old issue of
"Mizopolitan" that was languishing under the bed.
95876: You can do that as many times as you like, but you won't find anything
else under there.
95940: It's way too dark to see under there.
95968: You flip through the old issue of "Mizopolitan:" five articles catch
your eye.
96024: Oh God no. Just reading the titles is enough to remove any self-respect
as a writer you might've had left.
96100: The first article is titled "Cheating: It Isn't Just For Adventure
Gamers!"
96160: Oh God no. Just reading the titles is enough to remove any self-respect
as a writer you might've had left.
96236: The second article is titled "Getting in Touch with Your Inner Creator."
96292: Oh God no. Just reading the titles is enough to remove any self-respect
as a writer you might've had left.
96368: The third article is titled "Opening the Door to Success."
96412: Oh God no. Just reading the titles is enough to remove any self-respect
as a writer you might've had left.
96488: The fourth article is titled "Be Nice to Men ... They're Dumber than You
Are."
96552: Oh God no. Just reading the titles is enough to remove any self-respect
as a writer you might've had left.
96628: The fifth article is titled "When a Decent Lay Goes Astray."
96676: Oh God no. Just reading the titles is enough to remove any self-respect
as a writer you might've had left.
96752: Say which article you want to look at, please.
96788: You've dedicated it to the latest installment of your fantasy series
RANS.
96842: It boots up with hardly a buzz or a bleep.
96876: There's enough for you to type the whole book, if only you could think
of anything.
96940: If you wanna read what you've written so far, restart the game!
96988: You gotta write it before you can read it.
97020: Nothing. Not a whit. Not a shred.
97048: It's a sturdy stack of manuscript.
97076: Your newest novel in the RANS series begins in a mountain fastness in a
time of civil war. The Princess Sephyr and her loyal retainer Kyub are rescued
by a powerful stranger from another land who goes on a secret mission to the
capital, fights alongside the loyalist resistance and discovers a resistance
leader's treason which, when revealed, gains the Princess and the loyalists
popular support, so the rebellion is overthrown. The book ends at a "speaking
contest" in a rural market fair close to the sea, whence the "stranger" is
apparently about to embark to a new and unexplored place. You leave it nicely
ambiguous at the end whether the rebellion that threatened the kingdom has been
crushed, or its crushing is only inevitable.
97588: You also see a telephone.
97608: It's the phone you've been using to call room service.
97648: The door to the hallway is chained, latched and double-locked (from the
inside).
97706: You unchain the chain, slide back the latch and flip the deadbolt with a
practiced flip of the wrist.
97780: Locked and latched all over again.
97808: The minibar supports a small coffeemaker.
97840: You're too drunk to be able to manage that, but you dimly recall it has
an opening where you pour water, a basket to put coffee filters in, and a
switch to start it up.
97960: You fumble with the plug, but it's about like trying to disrobe a
one-night-stand while in a similar condition. Unlike that experience, you soon
give up.
98068: The liquid strikes the top of the unopened coffeemaker and spills all
over the floor. Neatness is evidently not one of your virtues.
98160: Your hand trembles vividly, but you manage to get most of the water into
the coffeemaker, about enough for a cup. The rest of it will dry, you hope.
98280: Your hand trembles vividly, but you manage to get most of the water into
the coffeemaker, about enough for a cup. The rest of it will dry, you hope.
98400: Filled with rye whiskey, as per your instructions.
98452: Filled with mouthwash, as per your instructions.
98500: It won't work without a basket in it. Just pointing this out.
98544: Ahem ... I'd suggest you empty the bottle before doing this.
98592: Aw fuck me! The mouthwash bottle's melting!
98670: CCRRIIIINNGGMMNNGGHHSSS!

As the night wears on, your guilt over your
wanton destruction of hotel property gives you a slight heartburn and curbs
your ability to think for a spell. You sit staring at the walls. Then you
sleep. Then you wake up past your deadline, imagining you really might've
finished your book if you'd kept awake. Nah. To hell with this writer shit
anyway. You're a drunk, is all there is to it. Have a nice rest of your life.
99000: A labored hissing and bubbling sound issues from the coffeemaker.
99048: It'll turn itself off when it's ready.
99076: The coffeemaker emits a series of gasping, snorting noises, then goes
silent.
99132: All you've accomplished now is to leave an unholy mess on the floor. The
coffeemaker doesn't look too streamlined either.
99218: All you've accomplished now is to leave an unholy mess on the floor.
99296: You experience a dramatic clearing of the head ... a warehouse-sized
clearance is more like it.  Now if you could just get a bit of fresh air ...
99402: You get the plastic top situated over the reservoir again.
99446: You take the plastic top off the reservoir.
99568: Jesus, what do you need, a walkthrough?
99600: Easier to do by far if you take the basket out of the coffeemaker.
99646: You just manage to slide the basket out of the coffeemaker. Sliding it
back in is gonna be another thing entirely.
99728: In your state, you'd better line it up first.
99764: It's the old filter full of coffee dregs.
99796: Ick! Why not just empty the basket somewhere?
99830: Next to the coffeemaker are three packets of Insta-Drip Dark Roast.
99884: Next to the coffeemaker are two packets of Insta-Drip Dark Roast.
99934: Next to the coffeemaker is a packet of Insta-Drip Dark Roast.
99984: It looks just like a packet of Insta-Drip.
100016: You struggle to do this, but your hands aren't deft enough, or the
packet is too tightly sealed, or ... well, you know.
100104: I'd clear my throat if I had one.
100130: You tear an opening big enough to pour from (and are fated to have
coffee grounds all over your teeth for hours).
100214: Next to the coffeemaker are three packets of Insta-Drip Dark Roast.
100268: Next to the coffeemaker are two packets of Insta-Drip Dark Roast.
100318: Next to the coffeemaker is a packet of Insta-Drip Dark Roast.
100368: It looks just like a packet of Insta-Drip.
100400: You struggle to do this, but your hands aren't deft enough, or the
packet is too tightly sealed, or ... well, you know.
100488: I'd clear my throat if I had one.
100514: You tear an opening big enough to pour from (and are fated to have
coffee grounds all over your teeth for hours).
100598: Next to the coffeemaker are three packets of Insta-Drip Dark Roast.

100702: Next to the coffeemaker is a packet of Insta-Drip Dark Roast.
100752: It looks just like a packet of Insta-Drip.
100784: You struggle to do this, but your hands aren't deft enough, or the
packet is too tightly sealed, or ... well, you know.
100872: I'd clear my throat if I had one.
100898: You tear an opening big enough to pour from (and are fated to have
coffee grounds all over your teeth for hours).
100984: The gouda is straitly bound in cellophane and sealed in wax. You know
how they are.
101044: No effort you make, no sweat you sweat, appears to help toward opening
the lonely gouda.
101106: As you peel the gouda down to its red wax shell, it's hard to ignore
the suspicion that the red has migrated onto and into your hands, your skin. It
races along your arms and you feel its sickening flush on your neck, your face,
your very eyes. A wall of scarlet pours across the world. You blink. It isn't
unexpected this time. The thing you didn't expect was
101432: You've decided you aren't hungry. Not THAT hungry.
101482: The capital is convulsed with the most animal of conflicts, guerilla
war in the streets. Black smoke, the glare of unchecked burnings, painridden
screams fill the air. Somehow, somewhere in this indistinct warren of narrow
roads, you and Jepos were cut off from your Loyalist squadron and forced into a
hand-to-hand skirmish with rebel militia who knew who and what you were, caught
you with only one sword between you, and seem to increase in number by the
minute. You passed the sword to Jepos, of course--it's been your habit to leave
feminist issues out of this novel, but at the moment you wish you hadn't made
chivalry such an automatic code.

Do something about that mace or you're dead!
101968: The capital is convulsed with the most animal of conflicts, guerilla
war in the streets. Black smoke, the glare of unchecked burnings, painridden

feminist issues out of this novel, but at the moment you wish you hadn't made
chivalry such an automatic code.
102420: Your partner Jepos stands beside you.
102448: She has a straight back, sallow glowing skin & dark-lashed eyes. She's
been a part of your squadron ever since the Resistance got going. She doesn't
say much, unless she needs to. She carries a sword.
102596: She has a straight back, sallow glowing skin & dark-lashed eyes. She's
been a part of your squadron ever since the Resistance got going. She doesn't
say much, unless she needs to.
102728: Did she say something? That'd be out of character somewhat.
102772: "If I were sure what we were fighting for, or even what we're fighting
against, I'd feel a lot better."
102848: "No wonder we're losing, if our commander is working with the enemy."
102900: "All I know is, Sephyr's against them. That's good enough for me."
102952: "She's the Heir. It's as simple as that."
102988: "I know who you are. I wonder if you do."
103020: "There's not much to tell. I was a little girl, now I'm a big girl, and
you know what's made me that way."
103100: "I don't like him much, but he's the boss."
103136: "No wonder we're losing, if our commander is working with the enemy."
103188: "I think it must lead to Kamendro's room."
103220: "They give me the creeps. But what ARE they?"
103256: "What're you doing, flirting? Not that I don't appreciate it."
103304: "It happened. I'm a big girl. We don't have to talk about it anymore."
103360: "It's part of something else, something unknown to me."
103404: She reads it to you: "I, Kamendro, pledge my fate, and the fate of my
followers, to the success of the Rebellion."
103488: Jepos has nothing to say on that topic.
103516: You're close enough to hear her gasp, though no one else is.
103560: "I was there, remember? I heard the whole thing."
103600: Are you as insane as that command makes you sound?
103636: "That belongs to you, in more ways than one."
103672: Her eyes stare into yours with a bit of startlement and a bit of a
smile. Her warm lips, rich and clinging, answer every motion of your own.
103772: It goes on and on, a black hole in the flow of time.
103812: You feel each other's shortened breath and hammering hearts.
103856: This isn't an ideal place for nakedness, is it? I'm sure you can
uncover the essential places.
103924: Does the word "foreplay" ring a bell?
103952: It's urgent, almost desperate, but attentive and careful at the same
time. Your organs could've been engineered to slide together, your rhythms are
a single rhythm--towering, cresting, washing you with steep delight and the
muffled cries it pulls forth. Tenderly, deeply hushed, you disentangle.
104160: You've been deliciously fucked. You're a whole other kind of fucked if
you want more anytime soon.
104232: "I'll do it, but we need to get closer to his room."
104272: Your partner Jepos stands beside you, holding a small blackened mirror.
104322: She stares into you. You can't tell much about what's behind her eyes.
But then she nods, takes her sword in hand and steps through the doorway. You
nearly stagger, expecting all her weight to be added to your belongings, but
there's nothing. You're alone.

After a short time she steps into being again.
If doing a murder has changed her, the change is only apparent now in her
refusal to look you in the eyes. "I found a parchment in Kamendro's
handwriting," she says, "written in Kamendro's blood, pledging himself to the
Rebellion. Once the others see it, they'll believe we've been betrayed. We can
start to weed ourselves out, piece ourselves back together." She holds up a
small blackened mirror. "This is something Kamendro was keeping--but it really
belongs to you."
104880: "You can't just tell me to do something like that."
104920: "I'll do it, but we need to get closer to Kamendro's room."
104968: Your partner Jepos stands beside you, holding a small blackened mirror.
105018: She stares into you. You can't tell much about what's behind her eyes.
But then she nods, takes her sword in hand and steps through the doorway. You
nearly stagger, expecting all her weight to be added to your belongings, but
there's nothing. You're alone.

After a short time she steps into being again.
If doing a murder has changed her, the change is only apparent now in her
refusal to look you in the eyes. "I found a parchment in Kamendro's
handwriting," she says, "written in Kamendro's blood, pledging himself to the
Rebellion. Once the others see it, they'll believe we've been betrayed. We can
start to weed ourselves out, piece ourselves back together." She holds up a
small blackened mirror. "This is something Kamendro was keeping--but it really
belongs to you."
105576: She passes you her sword, staring steadily.
105608: She hands you the piece of parchment.
105636: "You'd rather I did it? Fine. Just give the order." She hands the
doorway back to you.
105702: Your hands meet once more, and within the now-familiar swoon that
signals a shift of world, you hear Jepos tell you, "To recognize evil is to
recognize it in oneself: but recognizing it in yourself, you banish it." Then
the shift is complete.
105876: She reads it to you: "I, Kamendro, pledge my fate, and the fate of my
followers, to the success of the Rebellion."
105964: It's a sword.
105976: The grim man isn't interested in academic questions, you realize as his
sword impales you.
106040: I guess you decided not to talk him round ...
106074: You waited too long to do anything about the mace. I'm afraid you can
no longer be described as someone with a good head on your shoulders, or indeed
much of one at all.
106196: You lunge downward out of the way of the mace, which passes overhead
with a grisly whistle, but you raise so much dust in the process that you can't
see a thing!
106308: As you flounder lost in the dust, it's simple for your enemies, not
similarly affected, to locate your ribs and stick their swords between them.
106412: You vault backwards out of the path of the mace, slamming into Jepos
and knocking her to the ground beneath a rebel fighter, who prepares to thrust
his sword into her heart.
106532: You don't act soon enough to prevent Jepos from being run through ...
and something tells you that's not really the best thing you could've done.
You've introduced this character only to kill her off, without stopping to
consider how important she could have been to the story--or to you. I guess
you're not the novelist you think you are. Maybe you never were.

You kneel and
shut your eyes, not caring if you wake up in the hotel room or in the land
you've so callously ruined. There's no point in going on now.
106896: As you struggle to get the dust out of your eyes, someone drops a thick
net over you, like the ones in those gladiator B-movies.
106986: As you thrash ineffectually in the net, someone inserts a sword through
the mesh. You cry out, but the end is clean and quick.
107080: You stir up the dust enough to get it in everyone's eyes. After a
period of panicked yelling on all sides, the cloud of dust begins to
settle--soon enough for you to see a runaway cart, set on fire, careening right
for Jepos!
107238: The cart smashes into Jepos and she goes up like a torch, with barely
enough time to wail her fear and hurt ... and it strikes you maybe you ought'nt
have let this happen. You've introduced this character only to kill her off,
without stopping to consider how important she could have been to the story--or
to you. I guess you're not the novelist you think you are. Maybe you never
were.

You kneel and shut your eyes, not caring if you wake up in the hotel
room or in the land you've so callously ruined. There's no point in going on
now.
107620: You knock the enemy's sword aside, causing it to slash open a barrel of
oil standing nearby, which promptly spills all over the street, and you fall on
your ass!
107732: As you thrash about merrily in the pool of oil, someone slides by
jerking a sledgehammer and smashes in your skull.
107812: Leaping up, she shoves you angrily, snarling "I can take care of
myself!" and effortlessly knocks the sword away, as well as you, who stumble
against an apple barrel and set apples rolling all over the street. You're
barely managing to stay upright!
107988: Trying desperately to keep your purchase on the apples, you fail to
notice till it's too late that someone's axe has peeled and cored you quite
similarly to an apple!
108104: The more you squirm, the more tightly the net wraps around you.
108148: You gave your sword away, remember? But THEY didn't.
108190: As you thrash ineffectually in the net, someone inserts a sword through
the mesh. You cry out, but the end is clean and quick.
108282: As you thrash ineffectually in the net, someone inserts a sword through
the mesh. You cry out, but the end is clean and quick.
108376: They didn't expect that. As the net rises, the rebels holding onto it
are yanked off their feet and fall over backwards. You snatch someone's sword
and cut yourself free of the net, but a grim man rises hastily from the street,
also with a sword, and faces you.
108558: You do nothing that persuades the grim man not to run you through, so
I'm afraid that's what happens.
108636: You leap onto the hurtling cart, tipping it over and halting its
progress, but the other side comes up like a seesaw and sends you flying
straight toward a brick wall!
108750: ... And running into the brick wall is exactly like running into a
brick wall. Head first.
108940: Beating your retreat, you look back on Jepos's dying clash with the
hemming rebel force ... and it strikes you maybe you ought'nt have let this
happen. You've introduced this character only to kill her off, without stopping
to consider how important she could have been to the story--or to you. I guess
you're not the novelist you think you are. Maybe you never were.

You kneel and
shut your eyes, not caring if you wake up in the hotel room or in the land
you've so callously ruined. There's no point in going on now.
109306: As you stand at the edges of the battle making up your sluggish mind, a
large rock sails out of the melee toward you and settles the issue once and for
all.
109558: Beating your retreat, you look back on Jepos's dying clash with the
hemming rebel force ... and it strikes you maybe you ought'nt have let this
happen. You've introduced this character only to kill her off, without stopping
to consider how important she could have been to the story--or to you. I guess
you're not the novelist you think you are. Maybe you never were.

You kneel and
shut your eyes, not caring if you wake up in the hotel room or in the land
you've so callously ruined. There's no point in going on now.
109926: As you stand at the edges of the battle making up your sluggish mind, a
large rock sails out of the melee toward you and settles the issue once and for
all.
110166: Beating your retreat, you look back on Jepos's dying clash with the
hemming rebel force ... and it strikes you maybe you ought'nt have let this
happen. You've introduced this character only to kill her off, without stopping
to consider how important she could have been to the story--or to you. I guess

You kneel and
shut your eyes, not caring if you wake up in the hotel room or in the land
you've so callously ruined. There's no point in going on now.
110534: As you stand at the edges of the battle making up your sluggish mind, a
large rock sails out of the melee toward you and settles the issue once and for
all.
110644: Sword rings on sword! It's sweaty, heavy-breathing stuff, this lunging
in the spuming dust. Your foe has been fighting longer than you, so he's soon
winded and less and less able to defend against your jabs and downstrokes.
110802: With a practiced shove of your sword, you finish off your foe ... and
suddenly wonder if that was what you really had in mind for this episode.
Perhaps the grim man would've been willing to talk. Perhaps you could've
explained yourself, learned something about the rebels ... too late, by your
own doing. I guess you're not the novelist you think you are. Maybe you never
were.

You kneel and shut your eyes, not caring if you wake up in the hotel
room or in the land you've so callously ruined. There's no point in going on
now.
111178: You do nothing that persuades the grim man not to run you through, so
I'm afraid that's what happens.
111256: You pause to salute your foe, and tell him "We have things to talk
about." He doesn't alter his stance a bit: "Speak quickly."
111350: With a practiced shove of your sword, you finish off your foe ... and
suddenly wonder if that was what you really had in mind for this episode.
Perhaps the grim man would've been willing to talk. Perhaps you could've
explained yourself, learned something about the rebels ... too late, by your
own doing. I guess you're not the novelist you think you are. Maybe you never
were.

You kneel and shut your eyes, not caring if you wake up in the hotel
room or in the land you've so callously ruined. There's no point in going on
now.
111726: You do nothing that persuades the grim man not to run you through, so
I'm afraid that's what happens.
111804: Twisting in the air, you fall ... directly on Jepos! The rebels around
you prepare to hack her up.
111876: You lug yourself to your feet--and find yourself once again in the path
of the gleaming mace! This time it does its job.
111960: No good. You and Jepos are nicely pureed by sharp descending swords.
112012: Your impetus gives you a brief tactical advantage, but in no time
you're utterly ringed by a thicket of swords!
112090: No good. The swords bear in on you and slice you into tiny bits.
112140: The two of you speak in panting whispers. You get the impression that
these rebels are in the dark about why they're fighting or what they hope to
achieve, but they're cowed by their officers and downright panicked by the
Crystal Warriors. Your own thoughts about the loyalist movement, and the
Rebellion itself, are pretty vague as yet, so you have a hard time explaining
yourself to the grim man. Perhaps Jepos knows something?
112440: The two of you don't know each other well enough that when you let your
guard down, he won't run you through. In case that sentence was a tad complex,
he runs you through.
112560: You do nothing that persuades the grim man not to run you through, so
I'm afraid that's what happens.
112636: You snatch up a dead man's sword and fight. Swinging and heaving
interminably by yourself, you're soon at your last available ounce of
endurance.
112740: The ounce is gone. That means so are you.
112770: No good. The swords bear in on you and slice you into tiny bits.
112820: Jepos makes her way to your side, but there's a noise: horses. Your
enemies pause to look about them, and so do you. Four Crystal Warriors are
clopping toward you down a main street! Everyone's stunned, since these
creatures NEVER concern themselves with guerilla squabbles like this, but the
big thing is, if they're involved, you and Jepos don't have a chance in hell of
living through this.
113104: You ditch your weapon. Jepos's sword is small enough to hide.
113148: You blend into the newly-still crowds and fade away, stopping only when
you find a back alley tucked away from sight.
113232: This is the city square, with its gruesome exhibit.
113268: Sickened to your soul, it hardly helps.

Jepos touches your shoulder:
"There's nothing we can do for them. But we can save the rest of us, and maybe
more, if we expose Kamendro. Let's take that little doorway someplace
quiet."

You walk in a hunted shamble, saying nothing, and Jepos only comes out
of her silence once, to mutter the words "He'll have to die." It seems to take
hours to get there.
113558: Jepos touches your shoulder: "There's nothing we can do for them. But
we can save the rest of us, and maybe more, if we expose Kamendro. Let's take
that little doorway someplace quiet."

You walk in a hunted shamble, saying
nothing, and Jepos only comes out of her silence once, to mutter the words
"He'll have to die." It seems to take hours to get there.
113820: Inhabited by shadows and tumbled bricks, this blind alley provides a
momentary hiding-place from that grim business in the streets. You can still be
seen from the alley's opening, but toward the rear wall is a niche where that
might not be possible.
113992: You and Jepos step out from the niche. The Crystal Warrior swivels to
face you, lifts a faceted arm and points ... something ... toward you,
something that sends unbearable hunger and thirst throughout your body. You can
actually feel your tissues wither on your bones, and your bones make a clatter
as they fall.
114216: You and Jepos step out from the niche.
114244: The unmistakable sound of a human voice brings Kamendro and the Warrior
to the niche. Kamendro grins a vile grin, but the Crystal Warrior raises a
faceted arm and points ... something ... toward you, something that sends
unbearable hunger and thirst throughout your body. You can actually feel your
tissues wither on your bones, and your bones make a clatter as they fall.
114508: The necklace strikes the far wall with a muted clatter. Kamendro and
the Crystal Warrior both flinch and swivel around, but see nothing in the
alley, then flee hurriedly into the streets. The Warrior lets something fall
behind him in his haste.
114678: The loud noise brings Kamendro and the Warrior to the niche. Kamendro
grins a vile grin, but the Crystal Warrior raises a faceted arm and points ...
something ... toward you, something that sends unbearable hunger and thirst
throughout your body. You can actually feel your tissues wither on your bones,
and your bones make a clatter as they fall.
114926: You hear a sound at the mouth of the alley and turn. One of the Crystal
Warriors stands before you, still, immense, inhuman. He raises a faceted arm
and points ... something ... toward you, something that sends unbearable hunger
and thirst throughout your body. You can actually feel your tissues wither on
your bones, and your bones make a clatter as they fall.
115186: You detect something, a rustle or shift in the air. Moving your eye
around the edge of the niche, you see two men have entered the alley and stand
talking. One is Kamendro, leader of the loyalist movement, and the other is a
Crystal Warrior!
115360: Better stay hidden, you two.
115382: Once the noises of chaos subside, you and Jepos creep out of the alley
and make your way into the streets again, bearing for the resistance
headquarters ...

But there's an eerie light and silence in the city square,
though you can see it's filled with people. Jepos folds her garment over her
sword and the two of you move to the border of the crowd.

You can't take it in
at once. Over the vast spell of only several seconds you realize the line of
stakes with disembowelled, but still living, men & women nailed to them is the
Crystal Warriors' punishment for today's riot, and that these scarcely-human
effigies of torment are your fellow loyalists, many of them your friends.
Automatically you clap your hands to your knees and lower your head toward the
pavement.
115924: You and Jepos duck into the corner niche and now are nicely concealed
from anyone peering into the alley.
115996: Kamendro and one of the Crystal Warriors stand here talking.
116040: He's tall, with a long face and baggy eyes. He came from nowhere, and
no one quite understands how he was acclaimed as the leader of the Resistance.
Remember?
116152: The Warrior speaks, with a voice like the bowels of night: "Why summon
Us here? We carry with Us the door by which We usually visit you."

Kamendro
answers, "This couldn't wait. One of your soldiers contacted me just now and
told me he'd seen him--here, in the city."
116350: The Warrior stiffens visibly. "He is here?"

"Fighting with my own
folk. That'd put him in a position to find out about me, don't you think?"
116460: The Warrior makes a wave of dismissal. "Not unless he gains access to
your quarters. The proof is there. Your loyalists would never believe such a
thing without proof."

"I'll have him slain on sight once I locate him,"
Kamendro says. "But how do I recognize him? These rabble are all the same."
116678: The Warrior nods, his blank eyes casting light: "He bears the necklace.
It was gone from the House Of Kyub, and so were Our noble prey. Once it comes
to Us, the Princess will be in Our power at last."

"You'll have it," Kamendro
promises. "I'll pry it myself from his dead hand."
116892: They've stopped talking. Kamendro is peering out of the alley,
preparing to slip away unobserved.
116964: With smooth haste the conspirators flee into the streets and are gone.
117012: Identical to all the others, his facets are like floating planes of
glow in the alley's broken darkness.
117084: It's squishy, pulsing, hard to hold onto because your hands keep going
through it. Magical objects are really very irritating.
117176: You don't need to drop it to enter it, but someone else ought to hold
it if you want to avoid mathematical irregularities.
117260: Your partner Jepos stands beside you, holding the pocket doorway.
117308: Jepos takes the pocket doorway and holds it before you. You see only
darkness within. "I'll wait beneath the window," she says. "Find this proof and
drop it down to me."
117432: "We need to find a quieter place to use that," Jepos says.
117476: You don't need to drop it to enter it, but someone else ought to hold
it if you want to avoid mathematical irregularities.
117560: You step through the dark doorway into a lighted room. Turning behind
you, you see no opening.
117628: I wouldn't try that here. It's too public.
117660: Just a recess in the bricks where ill-designed buildings fail to make a
good corner.
117720: You and Jepos duck into the corner niche and now are nicely concealed
from anyone peering into the alley.
117792: This sector of the city, near your hidden barracks, is removed from the
tumult. In the distance the building where Kamendro has his quarters can be
seen, as well as the laborers and loiterers who shield the front door. A lamp
lights a third-floor window there.
117976: This is where you need to be.
118000: A dirty mirror, in odd contrast to its gaudy surroundings, is propped
here on the floor.
118064: The mirror is a rough square of blackened glass.
118100: Taken. Behind the mirror is a small piece of parchment inscribed in--is
that dried blood?
118164: Your hands meet once more, and within the now-familiar swoon that
signals a shift of world, you hear Jepos tell you, "To recognize evil is to
recognize it in oneself: but recognizing it in yourself, you banish it." Then
the shift is complete.
118336: You know a bit more now about the man you see there ...
118376: Loosely-grouped lines of guards masquerading as passersby surround the
command building. You and Jepos are too insignificant to get in that way, and
you don't know the current passwords anyhow.
118512: The building is nicely anonymous, the lit window too high up to reach.
118564: This room is less Spartan than you'd have imagined before you learned
about Kamendro's connections: fine tapestries cover all the walls and ample
carpets the floors. A door to the south is unlocked, but probably guarded on
the other side.
118732: Let's just spoil everything, why don't we?
118764: You doubt there's anything of interest stashed behind or under the
room's fixtures, but you check anyhow, and hey! You're right.
118856: Kamendro, his boots off but otherwise still clothed, stretches asleep
on a canopied poster bed.
118924: He's sound asleep, but I wouldn't make a lot of noise.
118964: You skewer him neatly through, wipe the sword on a fancy wall hanging,
and the deed is done. He never felt it.
119042: You skewer him neatly through, wipe the sword on a fancy wall hanging,
and the deed is done. He never felt it.

Then the swoon you've almost become
used to shakes you into another place.
119178: You skewer him neatly through, wipe the sword on a fancy wall hanging,
and the deed is done. He never felt it.

You notice a blue line of rock running
along the floor and quietly fluorescing. You touch it and it flashes. Then ...
119348: You aren't carrying anything that'd help you do that.
119388: You think better of it. He knows who you are, and will hardly be
inclined to engage in chitchat.
119456: You're here to do one thing to Kamendro, nothing else.
119496: Kamendro, his boots off but otherwise clothed, stretches dead on a
canopied poster bed pooling with blood.
119572: He looks about the same as he did before you killed him, bar the gaping
chest wound.
119632: A brass lamp hangs from a chain next to an open window.
119744: There's not enough light outside to see anything through the window,
but you trust Jepos is awaiting you below.
119824: There's not enough light outside to see anything through the window,
but you trust Jepos is awaiting you below.
119904: "I, Kamendro, pledge my fate, and the fate of my followers, to the
success of the Rebellion."
119974: You let the parchment tumble downwards. After a moment you hear a clear
voice beneath: "To recognize evil is to recognize it in oneself: but
recognizing it in yourself, you banish it."

Then the swoon you've almost
become used to shakes you into another place.
120162: You let the parchment tumble downwards. After a moment you hear a clear
voice beneath: "To recognize evil is to recognize it in oneself: but
recognizing it in yourself, you banish it."

You notice a blue line of rock
running along the floor and quietly fluorescing. You touch it and it flashes.
Then ...
120384: You let the parchment tumble downwards. After a moment you hear a clear
voice beneath: "To recognize evil is to recognize it in oneself: but
recognizing it in yourself, you banish it."
120514: You destroy the only evidence that could've convinced the loyalists of
Kamendro's treason ... and suddenly wonder if that was wise. If they'd
believed, perhaps there would've been more popular opposition to the Rebellion,
perhaps the rebel armies might've come over to the loyalist side and weakened
the Crystal Warriors beyond repair ... you see that now, but now you'll never
know. I guess you're not the novelist you think you are. Maybe you never
were.

You kneel and shut your eyes, not caring if you wake up in the hotel
room or in the land you've so callously ruined. There's no point in going on
now.
120948: Let's just spoil everything, why don't we?
120980: Not a thing you want to encounter more directly.
121016: Not a thing you want to encounter more directly.
121052: It's late afternoon and no lights are on, so this carpeted corner of a
house in the suburbs is dim, so dim you can scarcely make out the quaint
telephone table positioned between the kitchen door to the north and the dining
room door to the east.
121220: The phone rings twice, the answering machine switches on. A woman's
voice, rather tinny: "Hi. You've reached the home of Betty and Myron, but we
can't come to the phone at the moment. Please leave your name and number and
we'll call you back."
121398: A man's voice, clearer but somehow sad: "Hi honey, it's me. I guess I
can't get you to believe I'm working late anymore. Just wanted to see if you'd
talked to that lawyer yet. ... I guess you aren't there. Actually I do have to
be here late, so if you get home in the next couple hours, call. The traffic
getting here was agony, they've got workers all over this part of town, in the
street, on the sidewalk, everywhere. It wouldn't be so bad sitting there in the
monoxide if those street dancers who used to perform out in front of that hotel
were still around. ... I don't wanna hang up, but I better get finished. ... I
miss you, Betty. I wish things could've worked out."
121890: You hear the tape rewinding and see the message light blinking on and
off.
121944: As each time before, your senses tremble and the universe lurches like
a cut in a film clip.
122012: The message light is blinking on and off.
122044: It contains the expected telephone, phone book and answering machine.
122092: You can't seem to do anything about it, one way or the other. Nor are
you quite that desperate for information.
122172: It's the sort of yeasty concoction they drink in England and similar
barbarous climes. You're amazed it's been chilled.
122260: The very thought makes you shudder, and you've been ill enough today.
122310: Splinters of sturdy German glass penetrate several of your vital
organs!

It's been that kind of day.
122420: It's a pint bottle--conservative for you, you're a fifth
fan--manufactured by Mr. James Beam, a gent who believes the customer is always
tight.
122540: You stand abstractedly (and unsteadily) at the sink long enough to let
the bottle overflow, and only pull back when you feel cold water spilling over
your hands.
122688: Filled once more with the hard stuff.
122730: Don't waste my time!
122812: The liquid spills all over the floor. Neatness is evidently not one of
your virtues.
122884: Splinters of brittle Kentucky glass penetrate several of your vital
organs!

It's been that kind of day.
122960: This is what's nearly done you in tonight.
122990: Hic. Now we can sing a song, but now we need to lie down, the voice
rises better, and what shall we sing? And who shall we sing it to?

You yawn.
Then you sleep. Then you wake up past your deadline, imagining you really
might've finished your book if you'd kept awake. Nah. To hell with this writer
shit anyway. You're a drunk, is all there is to it. Have a nice rest of your
life.
123280: The liquid spills all over the floor. Neatness is evidently not one of
your virtues.
123352: Filled with rye whiskey, as per your instructions.
123392: You're fucking drunk, you sot.
123448: You're too drunk to be able to manage that.
123480: You're too drunk to be able to manage that.
123512: You're too drunk to be able to manage that.
123544: You're sort of here, but sort of not, if you can relate to that. Use
your imagination, fantasist.
123616: You can't seem to do anything about it, one way or the other.
123660: Dear me: you don't seem able to move from this spot.
123700: You can't seem to do anything about it, one way or the other.
123888: There's nothing you want to accomplish with its help at the moment.
123936: They're yours. Other than the bottle of mouthwash, they provide no
startling insights.
124000: They're yours. They provide no startling insights.
124060: You don't need to pack.
124084: You're too drunk to discern much, but it looks full of mouthwash.
124132: You're too drunk to discern much, but it looks like a plastic bottle.
124220: You stand abstractedly (and unsteadily) at the sink long enough to let
the bottle overflow, and only pull back when you feel cold water spilling over
your hands.
124380: Filled once more with the tingly stuff.
124422: Don't waste my time!
124452: Down the sink. The sewers are sure to smell much better now.
124508: The liquid spills all over the floor. Neatness is evidently not one of
your virtues.
124584: Water is flowing from the tap.
124608: Water.
124620: Water.
124652: The liquid spills all over the floor. Neatness is evidently not one of
your virtues.
124724: Filled with water, as per your instructions.
124760: Water.
124792: The liquid spills all over the floor. Neatness is evidently not one of
your virtues.
124864: Filled with water, as per your instructions.
124900: It's green, I'm afraid.
124920: Gaaaah! You ain't sposed to drink mouthwash! Do I have to tell you you
choked till you dropped?
125004: The liquid spills all over the floor. Neatness is evidently not one of
your virtues.
125076: Filled with mouthwash, as per your instructions.
125112: You don't wanna carry that around!
125140: You threw that away, and it's bloody well thrown away!
125252: Don't panic.
125264: I SAID I wasn't gonna describe it.
125292: You stuff the towel into the basket.
125320: Good thinking, but you'd never find it again.
125356: Water is flowing from the tap.
125380: Well, it's, uh, a sink.
125400: Water starts flowing from the tap.
125512: It's difficult to credit that someone who can imagine such elaborate
fantasy worlds could have such minimal fashion sense.
125596: You ain't goin' nowhere. You don't need to pack.
125636: After squinting at it for a good twenty minutes, you see it says
"Coffee Filters."
125696: It's already open. All you need to do is pull the filters out of the
perforated hole.
125756: It's a new coffee filter.
125776: You're so impaired that when you attempt this, you wind up irrevocably
shredding all the filters but one.
125850: They aren't anywhere near the same size, but you stuff the filter in
the basket adequately enough to leave room for a bit of actual coffee.
125952: You ain't goin' nowhere. You don't need to pack.
126010: What it is is a hallway full of locked doors except for yours, which is
open but you knew that, a glass door onto a balcony to the west and an elevator
with call button to the north.
126154: What it is is a hallway full of locked doors except for yours, a glass
door onto a balcony to the west and an elevator with call button to the north.
126256: The characters in your novels might intrude into other people's rooms,
but believe it or not, you wouldn't.
126332: I guess "glass door" just didn't do it for you. How about "sliding
glass door?" How about "GO WEST?"
126412: I guess "glass door" just didn't do it for you. How about "sliding
glass door?" How about "GO WEST?"
126492: This is NOT some cheesy Keanu Reeves movie ... it's a cheesy Bob Reeves
text adventure!
126560: This is NOT some cheesy Keanu Reeves movie ... it's a cheesy Bob Reeves
text adventure!
126628: Not exactly ostentatious or exactly seedy (oh, give up and call it
"functional"), the lobby is silent at this time of day. You'd rather skirt any
contact with the front desk, which could involve a murder charge, the way
you've been treated: so the operative exits are north (to the elevator) and
south (to the street).
126856: Better not let Ralph see you walking away with that towel.
126900: You're still not willing to actually walk past Ralph.
126940: Relevance, relevance!
126956: Ralph the doorman stands here with an air of not-so-faint disdain for
you and all your kind and all their works.
127036: Ralph the doorman stands here with an air of edgy impatience; he seems
prepared to ignore you completely for the moment.
127122: Ralph the doorman (just barely) stands here half-asleep. He's obviously
worked that beer you slipped him earlier into this coffeebreak.
127222: Ralph the doorman (just barely) stands here half-asleep. He's obviously
worked that beer you slipped him earlier into this coffeebreak.
127324: Ralph is the kind of functionary whose goal in life is to rail against
the forces that've landed him his goal in life. That's you.
127416: Ralph wouldn't dream of saying anything requiring a reply.
127460: Ralph glances at his watch, takes out a bottle of pills, and you see
his lips moving as he counts them, concentrating with might and main.
127556: "God, you've read those?" Ralph blurts out, then stiffens and mutters:
"Juvenile escapism."
127628: "This is indeed the hotel lobby, sir," Ralph breathes, eyes raised to
the ceiling.
127688: "That is indeed the street entrance, sir," Ralph breathes, eyes raised
to the ceiling.
127752: "Didn't those go out of existence in 1988 when Activision took over
Infocom? I wouldn't know anything about it."
127836: "Sorry, I'm just a non-player character."
127872: "As long as he stays across the street, I've got no objection."
127920: "It's not hotel policy for doormen to discuss payments due."
127964: Ralph's quick smirk is a study in contempt.
127996: "I am indeed the doorman, sir," Ralph breathes, eyes raised to the
ceiling.
128052: Ralph apparently finds that topic beneath his notice.
128092: Ralph apparently finds that information beneath his notice.
128136: I'm well aware the word "intimidate" contains the word "intimate," but
spelling aside, are you truly anxious to get that close to the Prince of
Prozac?
128244: Ralph stares down at the bottle, then up at you. Nothing is said, but
the suggestion of tears forming in his eyeducts is communication enough. He
moves to hold the door for you.
128368: "We're not allowed to accept gifts from guests, sir," Ralph tells you,
and you hear him add under his breath, "especially THOSE."
128468: Beside him is a pathetic potted plant.
128568: Shaded by the drooping waxy leaves of the plant is some sailor's duffel
bag, carefully folded. You shudder to think what anyone, even a sailor,
might've been trying to smuggle into this hotel, let alone out.
128716: Drooping waxy leaves, as I believe I already told you.
128828: You unfold the duffel bag, beholding ... a capacious emptiness.
128874: You had a feeling this would happen. As you touch the duffel bag, the
navy blue of its humdrum stitching threads itself into your eyes and into the
air of the world, which becomes a seamless expanding fabric of blue weave whose
warp and woof continue to swell and swell until you topple through the holes in
the cloth and
129152: The softly-bending road leads northeast toward the market town. The
dust of the road is laid from the outfarmers who tramped it before the dawn.
Now the sun is past noon but kindly on the shapely countryside, and the air
hints of salt.
129316: There's gotta be an ocean around here someplace!
129352: It'd be a treat to amble gorgeously around, but you suspect things are
brewing in the market ... and anything brewing tends to get your attention, you
know.
129464: More of a plaza at this point in its course.
129496: Plain, flat, an easy walk from here.
129524: An ancient but thriving oak deposits its shadow on the thoroughfare
here. The sun's not hot today, but the relief from light is welcome. You could
do with a moment's sitting.
129648: There's gotta be an ocean around here someplace!
129684: You rest yourself in the shade of the oak. Above your head you hear
flurries of whispering, like assorted human voices of mingled moods telling
endless woven stories.
129800: Been there, done that.
129820: It'd be a treat to amble gorgeously around, but you suspect things are
brewing in the market ... and anything brewing tends to get your attention, you
know.
129932: It rears above you protectively, bestowing a rich shade.
129972: It rears above you protectively, bestowing a rich shade.
130012: You assumed the whispering came from breeze in the leaves, but now see
it issues from the leaves of a book draped over a low branch.
130104: You rest yourself in the shade of the oak. Above your head you hear
flurries of whispering, like assorted human voices of mingled moods telling
endless woven stories.
130220: You can't get much of a look at it from down here.
130256: It's a thick volume bound in rich blue cloth, but without title on
cover or binding. It has no visible clasp or lock, but you can't seem to open
it, pry as you may.
130372: As soon as you pick it up, the book snaps shut.
130408: It just won't open. It just won't.
130436: The book says, "Open me when reading is your duty: not before."
130484: The book is written in a language you don't know.
130520: The book isn't whispering any longer.
130548: "Well! You gathered I could speak, did you? Quicker than some!"
130600: "We aren't here for chitchat, you and I."
130632: The book says, "Open me when reading is your duty, not before."
130680: "Well! You gathered I could speak, did you? Quicker than some!"
130732: "We aren't here for chitchat, you and I."
130764: A fair appears to be in progress, as indicated by the merry red and
green banners flapping over the guildhall to the north. Downhill to the east is
a sparkling seacoast thronged with market stalls, strolling families in gay
colors and buoyantly darting boats. A booth in front of the guildhall announces
SPEAKING CONTEST--SIGN UP HERE and is manned by a relaxed-looking official.
Spectators are lined up before the hall.
131072: Dark has fallen and the crowds dispersed like daytime sparrows. The
ocean gleams stilly in the moon, the banners too are drooped and still.
131168: You allow the crone to take your arm, and discover she's capable of a
robust pace. Actually, you don't have a long way to guide her.
131264: You curtly shake your head and turn away ... and something tells you
that's not really the best thing you could've done. You've spurned an unknown
character who might well have been important to the plot, and this close to the
end of your story, that's not a thing you can particularly afford to do. I
guess you're not the novelist you think you are. Maybe you never were.

You
kneel and shut your eyes, not caring if you wake up in the hotel room or in the
land you've so callously ruined. There's no point in going on now.
131632: "Will you be wanting to sign up for the Peace Speaking or the War
Speaking, sir?" the official asks.
131706: "You're just in time. There's only one slot left. Please proceed
inside, sir."

You enter the guildhall and are ushered to a seat in front.
131814: "You're just in time. There's only one slot left. Please proceed
inside, sir."

You enter the guildhall and are ushered to a seat in front.
131924: As charming as the coastal market looks, the "speaking contest" sounds
entirely more interesting.
131992: You make your way downhill toward the sea ... and something tells you
that's not really the best thing you could've done. You've spurned an unknown
character who might well have been important to the plot, and this close to the
end of your story, that's not a thing you can particularly afford to do. I
guess you're not the novelist you think you are. Maybe you never were.

You
kneel and shut your eyes, not caring if you wake up in the hotel room or in the
land you've so callously ruined. There's no point in going on now.
132360: Unless you're in the contest, it costs money to get in. You have no
money. QED.
132420: For better or worse, the contest is over and done with.
132460: Now you've walked all this way, you may as well check it out.
132504: You stride away from town along the country road ... and something
tells you that's not really the best thing you could've done. You've spurned an
unknown character who might well have been important to the plot, and this
close to the end of your story, that's not a thing you can particularly afford
to do. I guess you're not the novelist you think you are. Maybe you never
were.

You kneel and shut your eyes, not caring if you wake up in the hotel
room or in the land you've so callously ruined. There's no point in going on
now.
132880: The sea is calm, broad and blue beneath the noon.
132916: Except where the moonlight picks it out glancingly, the sea is an
unseen hugeness at this hour.
132984: Yes, I'm afraid your world has only one moon. Your imagination does
tend toward laziness at the edges.
133060: They're too far off to see much.
133084: A rounded wooden building painted a fresh sky blue.
133120: You can't get a look at most of them and don't want to draw attention
to yourself by swanning around.
133192: Townspeople and farmers alike, they're waiting festively to watch the
speaking contest, chatting among themselves.
133272: They almost notice you, but you can't seem to draw their focus.
133320: They almost notice you, but you can't seem to draw their focus.
133368: The colors of the Royal House, if your memory serves you.
133412: It's a booth. Yes indeedy.
133436: For better or worse, it's over and done with.
133472: If you thought the contest official would be at all remarkable to look
at, think again.
133532: "You're just in time. There's only one slot left. Please proceed
inside, sir."

You enter the guildhall and are ushered to a seat in front.
133638: "You're just in time. There's only one slot left. Please proceed
inside, sir."

You enter the guildhall and are ushered to a seat in front.
133748: "Did I say something that required an answer, sir?"
133788: An old crone stands here, squinting about through the dusk.
133832: The crone is holding out a brass lantern.
133864: She seems a woman who's lived a working life, but not an unhappy one.
She's not pathetically stooped, and the wrinkles in her face are more from
thought and laughter than care or age. When her eyes stray toward you they get
a tricky glint you can't interpret.
134044: The crone tugs at your sleeve. "That son of mine! Haled off with one of
these town hussies, I'll warrant, or asleep in his cups. May I prevail on you
to help me home, traveler?"
134174: You allow the crone to take your arm, and discover she's capable of a
robust pace. Actually, you don't have a long way to guide her.
134272: You allow the crone to take your arm, and discover she's capable of a

134368: You curtly shake your head and turn away ... and something tells you

character who might well have been important to the plot, and this close to the
end of your story, that's not a thing you can particularly afford to do. I
guess you're not the novelist you think you are. Maybe you never were.

You
kneel and shut your eyes, not caring if you wake up in the hotel room or in the
land you've so callously ruined. There's no point in going on now.
134736: Your answer makes her frown quizzically.
134764: "Now that the bold young lady's in charge, we can keep our hopes high."
134816: "The people are deserting them, aren't they? I doubt they're long for
the world."
134876: "We've been free of the war here thus far."
134908: The crone smiles an odd smile. Thinking about it, you realize its
oddness came from the fact that it seemed, well, young.
134996: "So that's the question on your mind, love?" She chuckles quietly.
135048: "See me home, dear. Such things are above us plain bodies."
135092: "The brave heart--blessings on her trials!"
135128: The crone smiles an odd smile. Thinking about it, you realize its
oddness came from the fact that it seemed, well, young.
135216: "Ah, the wayward soul, his torments now can't be harder than his
forfeiting himself to those creatures."
135292: The crone gives no response. It's as if you'd said nothing at all.
135340: "The folk will realize soon enough how many we are, how few they are."
135392: "To help you find your way," she says with a sweet grin.
135436: "In my youth, a white house stood in a clearing ... ah, mayhap I've
said too much."
135500: "A grand old codger, by all accounts."
135532: "Someone we both know seems to be helping that toward its end."
135580: The crone frowns quizzically and says nothing.
135612: "You need not tell me, dearie. I've heard it all."
135652: I'd pity you if you weren't acting like a jerk.
135688: "You'll do me enough if you walk me home, young one."
135728: She bows daintily and a bit ironically.
135792: The crone's dwelling lies to leeward of the market, on an empty stretch
of side-highway. It's low and dark, and sports a recent-looking straw roof. The
guildhall area lies somewhere to the east.
135930: "Hold a moment!" says the crone, swings open the door and briefly ducks
inside. She emerges again holding an uneasily-modern-looking brass lantern. "To
help you see your way," she says with a giggle.
136076: You drop her off without a moment's pause and start right back for town
... and something tells you that's not really the best thing you could've done.
You've been cavalier with a character who might well have been important to the
plot, and this close to the end of your story, that's not a thing you can
particularly afford to do. I guess you're not the novelist you think you are.
Maybe you never were.

You kneel and shut your eyes, not caring if you wake up
in the hotel room or in the land you've so callously ruined. There's no point
in going on now.
136468: The interior of the guildhall is a circular platform encircled by
curving rows of seats. As a contestant, you have a seat in the front row. The
judges are in the back, so not distinct from where you sit glancing over your
shoulder, but one of them is the mayor, who doesn't look all that
self-important, as these types go. The exit to outdoors is south.
136714: The contest is beginning; a woman frets about her teenage daughter in
blank verse.
136776: The contest is beginning; a woman frets about her enlisted son in blank
verse.
136834: A little old man does an elegy for King Seqwar.
137018: A sunburned woman performs an endless piece about the varieties of
plants in her garden.
137082: A sunburned woman performs an endless piece about the niceties of drill
practice.
137142: A boy lays out the reasons why his favorite band of minstrels is the
best band of minstrels.
137208: A boy lays out the reasons why his favorite platoon is the best
platoon.
137260: A pretty child addresses a poem to her doll, but holds the doll in
front of her face while she does it and can barely be heard.
137348: A pretty child addresses a poem to her dead father's locket, but holds
the locket in front of her face while she does it and can barely be heard.
137450: A tall man recites a hymn to the joys of fishing.
137488: A tall man recites a hymn to the joys of killing.
137524: A giggling girl pokes fun at her grandfather for being so old.
137568: A giggling girl pokes fun at her grandfather for being past army age.
137618: A young man presents a heavily symbolic poem about a chair that can't
be moved.
137676: A young man presents a heavily symbolic poem about a sword that can't
be sharpened.
137736: A roundish lady classifies the different types of rain.
137776: A roundish lady classifies the different types of cannonball.
137820: Tringle stands up, walks to the center of the pavilion and raises his
arms solemnly over his head. There's an amused, expectant stir in the crowd.
Tringle lowers his arms, and in a voice like silk, says the line

"This is
where the cats all meet to regret their mice."

He takes a bow, and as he sits
he mutters, "Eight seconds. I like to see how long it takes 'em to clap after
one of those."
138102: Tringle stands up, walks to the center of the pavilion and raises his
arms solemnly over his head. There's an amused, expectant stir in the crowd.
Tringle lowers his arms, and in a voice like iron, says the line

"This is
where the cats all meet to catch their mice."

He takes a bow, and as he sits
he mutters, "Eight seconds. I like to see how long it takes 'em to clap after
one of those."
138386: A bookish little fellow says a poem about how much he enjoyed being a
soldier and is instantly disqualified. Tringle pats you on the shoulder:
"You're next." You'd have to be number thirteen. You rise from your chair.
138544: A bookish little fellow says a poem about how much he enjoys watching
girls and is instantly disqualified. Tringle pats you on the shoulder: "You're
next." You'd have to be number thirteen. You rise from your chair.
138698: Nothing you can think of seems to please the judges. (You do see the
mayor regard you sadly, though you can't think why.) The youngest contestant
gets the prize, and you're left suspecting there was something else you
should've been paying attention to, something you should've explored better,
something you could've found to help you win, or at least put on a decent show.
The speaking contest was obviously important to this part of the story, and
you've blown it. I guess you're not the novelist you think you are. Maybe you
never were.

You kneel and shut your eyes, not caring if you wake up in the
hotel room or in the land you've so callously ruined. There's no point in going
on now.

139676: Words seem to issue from the blue book and enter your mouth, and you
speak them:

"I am looking in your light
 to find the flowers of your night

and have them darkily unclose
 what light and dark had lain in those.

 I am
seeking to believe
 the flower of night can still retrieve
 the windless ages
off your brow
 and call you here, and make you now."

You seat yourself to
uncertain applause, blushing, not really comprehending the suggestive but
uncomfortably archaic poem. The mayor beckons you forward: "The stranger wins!
Take this emblem of our esteem." He holds out to you an uneasily-modern-looking
brass lantern.
140118: Words seem to issue from the blue book and enter your mouth, and you
speak them:

"Then we shall set them ready, and shall find them
 the tools of
choice to drop the dead behind them.
 Their faces will not be for looking down

but in the gaze of all who seize the crown.

 And in their tread across the
fields of clamor
 they cannot speak unless it be to stammer
 that in their hour
of choice the red arose
 before their eyes that solely Freedom knows."

You
seat yourself to uncertain applause, blushing, not really comprehending the
poem. "Bit of a dangling relative in that last line," Tringle sighs as you sit
down.

Disappointingly, but understandably, you lose the contest to the girl
with the locket, and find yourself back outside the guildhall alone.
140660: People are performing. Don't be rude.
140688: You stand up before the contest has been judged, shove your way through
the spectators and return to the fair ... and something tells you that's not
really the best thing you could've done. You have a feeling the speaking
contest was crucial, your role in it crucial, but you're embarrassed to go
back. I guess you're not the novelist you think you are. Maybe you never
were.

You kneel and shut your eyes, not caring if you wake up in the hotel
room or in the land you've so callously ruined. There's no point in going on
now.
141060: Beside you sits a lively chap who introduces himself as Tringle. "I'm a
tinker hereabouts, but I do fancy a good speaking-contest."
141156: He's a compact, fidgety man with a sly grin and wide-open eyes.
141204: Tringle nods abruptly and politely, with a confused smile.
141248: "Anything specific you'd like to know about?"
141284: Tringle smiles. "A salubrious and cultured place, sir." He repeats
"salubrious" to himself in an enchanted whisper.
141368: Tringle shudders. "Not a place any of us want to be now, sir."
141416: "I can't wait to hear what everyone has in store," Tringle says,
rubbing his hands.
141480: "Once Commander Jepos revealed the conspiracy, the army defected and
the capital was won. After that it was mopping-up, no more."
141576: "Commander Jepos has published the conspiracy to the rebel army; I
expect them to turn on their masters."
141652: "It wasn't long for the world once the people found out Kamendro was in
league with the Warriors, and the reappearance of the Princess at the right
moment turned the tide."
141776: "They aren't long for the world now, is my feeling."
141816: "This town is too distant from the capital to be much involved in
events."
141868: "You mean the True Queen. Someone helped her escape an entire rebel
force in the mountains, they say."
141944: "She'll appear on the scene again, you can bank on it, and those rebel
fools will remember their true mistress."
142024: "Pans? You've come to the right place--visit my wagon after the show
and you'll have your pick!"
142096: Tringle pales slightly and lowers his voice: "I deal in many items, but
those ... those I reckon you should keep."
142180: "You found it! It got some ale spilt on it--through no fault of mine, I
promise you--and I left it on a tree to dry, for whoever came and found a use
for it: I never could."
142308: "Thirteenth contestant. Ever a lucky number!" He chuckles.
142352: "After Kamendro's fall they acclaimed her as Commander. It was the
right and proper choice, I deem."
142428: "After Kamendro's fall they acclaimed her as Commander. It'll be the
right and proper choice, I predict."
142508: "I'm a wanderer. I know something of what takes place in the urban
provinces, and folk make it worth my while to tarry and share the news."
142608: "The filth. He's gone, and his paymasters take him."
142648: "They were far from invincible, as it turned out, when confronted with
a righteous mob."
142712: "They seem invincible now, but let the folk rise up, they'll be a
bogeyman for kids' bedtimes."
142784: "Never met the man, I'm sorry to say."
142816: Tringle shrugs sheepishly: "I'm only a tinker, after all."
142860: Tringle nods abruptly and politely, with a confused smile.
142904: I'd suggest you join a circus, except no one would pay to see you.
142952: "I'm always out for rare goods, but yours are over-rare for the likes
of me."
143008: "You found it! It got some ale spilt on it--through no fault of mine, I
promise you--and I left it on a tree to dry, for whoever came and found a use
for it: I never could."
143136: "I'm always out for rare goods, but yours are over-rare for the likes
of me."
143192: Tringle pumps your hand vigorously.
143220: "We can gossip in whispers, my friend, but I'd best not be bustling
about."
143276: The only one you can make out is the mayor.
143308: The mayor is holding out a brass lantern.
143340: The mayor is simply adorned with his chain of office and a
carefully-trimmed beard starting to grey. He seems to pay serious heed to the
performances, but periodically his eyes stray toward you and get a questioning
glint you can't interpret.
143508: People are performing. Don't be rude.
143536: No sooner do you take the lantern than a blazing light engulfs you and
the mayor. You're without footing for an instant, hung in fathomless void, and
panic stabs through you--but this sort of thing isn't exactly new today, so you
determine to wait it out.
143714: You stand again in the Balmy Room at the House Of Kyub. Kyub himself
stands before you, and you recognize the mayor in his gaze. Beside him is
Sephyr.

"Behold, our author!" cries Kyub. "The three challenges for both an
author and a character--to choose freely and wisely; to know the nature of
evil; and to understand the value of peace even within the necessity of
war--have all been met. You are a true Maker, and we welcome you into our
Society. The lantern will enable you to see the final key to finishing your
task of telling our story."

"We too have told a story," adds Sephyr. "For we
are Makers, even as you made us, and our story is of a man who found it in him
to write a book--a mere adventure, some would say." She gestures to your
belongings. A green aura begins to glow around the necklace, a red aura around
the mirror, a blue one around the book. The auras meet, and flash with a single
pulse. You see the three items for a moment more, but changed, and no longer in
this place. You see yourself typing on a keyboard, staring at a monitor,
causing hard copy to rise from a slot--and recognize the laptop and printer in
your hotel room.

"The book is done," Sephyr's voice says. "Now go and write
it." But you're already far away, dropping, curled up, smashed together ...
actually, now you get your bearings, squatting in a box.
144692: No sooner do you take the lantern than a blazing light engulfs you and
the crone. You're without footing for an instant, hung in fathomless void, and
panic stabs through you--but this sort of thing isn't exactly new today, so you
determine to wait it out.
144870: You stand again in the Balmy Room at the House Of Kyub. Kyub himself
stands before you, and you recognize in his gaze the mayor from the speaking
contest. Beside him is Sephyr, and you recognize in her gaze the old
crone.

"Behold, our author!" cries Kyub. "The three challenges for both an
author and a character--to choose freely and wisely; to know the nature of
evil; and to understand the value of peace even within the necessity of
war--have all been met. You are a true Maker, and we welcome you into our
Society. The lantern will enable you to see the final key to finishing your
task of telling our story."

"We too have told a story," adds Sephyr. "For we

belongings. A green aura begins to glow around the necklace, a red aura around
the mirror, a blue one around the book. The auras meet, and flash with a single

this place. You see yourself typing on a keyboard, staring at a monitor,
causing hard copy to rise from a slot--and recognize the laptop and printer in
your hotel room.

"The book is done," Sephyr's voice says. "Now go and write
it." But you're already far away, dropping, curled up, smashed together ...
actually, now you get your bearings, squatting in a box.
145896: It's a battery-powered brass lantern. You can't conceive how it wound
up in a fantasy story.
145964: It's a battery-powered brass lantern. You can't conceive how it wound
up in a fantasy story, or how you can still have it with you.
146060: There's gratitude, in fact, that you share this carton stood on a
concrete wall with only a score of oblivious cockroaches. The scene you see
outside the box is sufficient to empty your stomach for days. Beneath the
freeway you hear clunking by above, someone has staked out an area of
inconceivable filth. Toxic grease and human waste cling to every surface of
what amounts to a barricade of junk, as well as to the shapeless individual who
sprawls asleep in its midst.
146382: Right about when you can't stand being here another second, you aren't.
146440: They seem right at home.
146460: Its thrumming echoes don't appear to keep the sleeper up at night.
146508: Could it be wiped up with any tool known to man?
146572: his size is someone who'd rather not know where the box wound up. It
must not've been here very long, because it's the only thing that doesn't cry
out for a good rubdown.
146752: God it's noisy! You don't wanna stick around here for long.
Construction crews have torn up everything around the hotel entrance except the
street to the south, but the traffic's a constant blaring snoring
monoxide-spewing river, and there's no traffic signal, cop or (needless to say)
helpful doorman in sight.
146972: God it's noisy! You don't wanna stick around here for long.
Construction crews have torn up everything around the hotel entrance except the
street to the south, where the traffic does seem a bit more placid.
147116: You do an inane little tapdance-ballet-softshoe-shuffle-moshpit flail
there on the corner, flapping your arms like an outraged cockatoo and singing
"Are You Lonesome Tonight?" at the top of your whiskey-cured voice. The
construction workers whistle (and heave a few rocks), but some faces in the
vehicles passing by regard you with friendship, and the traffic slows, if not
to a halt, at least to a speed you could take your chances with.
147424: Not to worry--the traffic seems more complacent since you made a
spectacle of yourself.
147488: Are you daft? You'd last perhaps a nanosecond.
147524: Whatever they're building, it looks about as safe as your average
origami crane folded by a three-year-old, and not as sturdy.
147616: It leads to the hotel. Damn, we ain't got nothin' like that back home!
147668: They enjoy being gawkers but not gawkees, and hurl remarks at you too
crude for even this author to repeat, and that's saying something.
147764: Take it from me: these aren't dudes you wanna fuck with at ALL.
147812: Watching the infinite frothing procession of vehicles is genuinely
brain-chilling, so you cut it out.
147884: You won't talk me into doing that again, I'll tell you that for free.
147936: You sprint through the minimally slower traffic, to find the opposite
corner occupied by a scabrous, loathsome specimen surrounded by a barricade of
junk. He gabbles to himself in a language only occasionally reminiscent of your
own, and doesn't stir a muscle to move his accumulated valuables out of your
way. Your way, incidentally, is west; you can recross the street to the north.
148204: You're on the corner across from your hotel. Gillian's building lies to
the west, and you can recross the street to the north.
148296: The junk seems impenetrable, immovable, and unpleasant to touch.
148344: It's an assemblage of things that look like the sides of shopping carts
or link fences, cardboard scraps, rusted pipes, shoes with holes as big as
their soles, small animal skins (you don't want to examine those too closely)
and bottles of nameless dark liquid, with toilet tissue, none too fresh (if you
get me), looped around and intertwined with the whole. You can't make out where
it begins or ends, or how the bum gets it here every day, or whether it is for
sale, for show, or for private mystical consolation.
148704: It's an assemblage of things that look like the sides of shopping carts
or link fences, cardboard scraps, rusted pipes, shoes with holes as big as
their soles, small animal skins (you don't want to examine those too closely)
and bottles of nameless dark liquid, with toilet tissue, none too fresh (if you
get me), looped around and intertwined with the whole. You can't make out where
it begins or ends, or whether it is for sale, for show, or for private mystical
consolation.
149036: A loathsome bum squats here, blocking the sidewalk with a barricade of
junk.
149090: A loathsome bum squats here, surrounded by a barricade of junk
penetrable only to the west.
149156: All your senses recoil from the man, whose outer covering may be
clothing, skin or dirt, it's impossible to tell. Whatever it is, it's peeling
off and flaking to the sidewalk as you watch. The few teeth he has are black
and jagged, his squinting eyes run with rheum, he's wearing what looks like a
tv-dinner tray on his head--but for all that, he appears physically healthy,
indeed bullishly strong.
149436: The sleeper is merely a shape, or the lack of one, in the encroaching
squalor.
149492: The words you can understand are ones you employ in real life but not
in your books.
149552: You've never, ever, smelt anything like it, and hope you never, ever,
do again.
149612: Speaking to the bum is, quite clearly, not an option.
149652: The bum tilts backward proudly and surveys his kingdom with something
possibly meant to be a smile.
149720: For a second he looks you right in the eye. Then whatever was looking
at you wanders away, though the eyes haven't moved.
149808: The bum shakes his head and waggles his finger, but not at you.
149852: The bum coughs violently into his hand, then sniffs the hand, then
licks it.
149908: "RANS!" he roars in a thunderous voice.
149940: The bum selects a flask of something impossibly vile from under his
haunches and takes a swig.
150004: He points to himself and nods. But then he points to you. Then to a
soggy matchbook.
150064: The bum stops breathing for a moment and his eyes stare wildly around.
He looks at your hands, then seems to shrug, and reverts to his mumbling.
150164: This evokes no discernible response.
150192: I hesitate to point this out, but such behavior could gravely
compromise your ability to breathe, walk upright and/or unaided, and respect
yourself in the morning.
150308: Slowly the bum rises to whatever he uses for feet, slowly he stretches
forth what's plausibly a hand, slowly and infinitely gently he takes from you
the towel. Then he does something even more out of character: he ceremoniously
bows--almost curtsies. Though he hasn't touched anything, there's suddenly an
opening in the western wall of junk.
150548: The bum clearly has everything he desires and more. So there.
150592: This is the anonymous office building that's been the bane of your
existence for what feels like most of your adult life. It looks uncomfortably
solid, for something that's been associated with so much liquid. You can enter
to the north, or retreat to the east.
150812: This is the walnut-paneled anteroom to your editor's office. Before her
door (to the west) a vast and blocklike desk is stationed, behind which Judy
sits, Cerberus to this Hades of the writer's soul. You can leave the way you
came in, to the south.
150992: You wouldn't dream of entering without Judy's permission, and have
nothing to submit in any case.
151064: You don't have any work to show the editor!
151096: You wouldn't dream of entering without Judy's permission.
151140: Judy is staring off into space.
151162: Now you've done it. Judy has been known to read these magazines till
well past closing time--which will also, I beg to point out, be well past your
deadline. Despite all the work you've done, I guess this last chore was too
much.
151328: Judy's brow achieves an ultimate wrinkle. She ushers you out of the
office and goes on her lunch break. Judy's lunch breaks have been known to last
longer than the shaping times when the destinies of nations are decided ... or
that's your frivolous way of seeing it. Anyway, it'll be long past your
deadline when she gets back. Despite all the work you've done, I guess this
last chore was too much.
151612: Judy's eyes blink exactly once; her brow wrinkles faintly.
151656: Judy's eyes blink exactly once; her brow wrinkles faintly.
151700: Judy's eyes blink exactly once; her brow wrinkles faintly.
151744: Judy's eyes blink exactly once; her brow wrinkles faintly.
151788: Judy's eyes blink exactly once; her brow wrinkles faintly.
151832: Judy's entire body trembles, as if a message from God is descending on
her. With a superhuman effort she exerts herself to nod in the vague direction
of Gillian's door.
151952: Judy's desk is a thing you simply don't want to confront, in any way,
shape or form.
152012: You've always found this a place you like to be.

Gillian looks up as
you enter: "Oh hi. I've been reading this weird little Chinese story about a
philosopher who wakes up from a dream and can't figure out if he's still
dreaming or not. Care for a drink?"
152232: Here there are only peace, the stars, and you.
152268: Excuse me?
152276: One of them, bizarrely enough, flashes green.
152720: everything has altered. You shake your head, draw a breath. You seem to
be none the worse, but as soon as you get it together enough to peer around
you, your guts knot and a splintering headache pokes into your brain.

This is
RANS. The world you created. The world that doesn't exist anyplace but on
bookshelves and in your own twisted fantasies. A world you don't even seem to
be interested in anymore.

It has to be. That right there (right THERE) is the
House Of Kyub, so ridiculously unique it couldn't be mistaken for any other
place, but neither can it be THIS place. What the holy fuck is going on?

You
thought you were scared before ...
153208: Examining the green star no longer makes anything happen.
153248: You stand on a flagged and trodden north-to-southwest pathway whence
you can see the strange roofless house of mossy green stone in a dell below.
153348: You recall from the little you know of Kyub--the little you've written
about him!--that he could control the weather from within his House ... but the
sky overhead appears ordinary at the moment.
153488: The sky overhead appears ordinary at the moment.
153524: The sky overhead is wildly confused and you can't make sense of it. It
hurts your head to try.
153592: The sky overhead is wildly confused and you can't make sense of it,
except there's a corner of sunlight over the northeasterly region of the house.
153696: Other directions than north and southwest seem a little chancy to you.
153744: The sky overhead appears ordinary at the moment.
153780: The sky overhead is wildly confused and you can't make sense of it. It
hurts your head to try.
153848: The sky overhead is wildly confused and you can't make sense of it,
except there's a corner of sunlight over the northeasterly region of the House.
153950: This tasteful welcoming-chamber to the House Of Kyub is panelled in
quiet oak and lined with cupboards, perhaps for the storage of coats, boots and
whatnot. Doorways lead south, east, west, northeast and northwest. No one seems
to be around.
154124: Do you somehow feel lighter than a minute ago?
154160: Some kind of force prevents you. Whatever it is, it feels warm on your
face.
154216: Some kind of force prevents you. Whatever it is, it feels warm on your
face.
154272: Some kind of force prevents you. Whatever it is, it feels warm on your
face.
154328: It has a string that permits it to be attached to someone's head.
154376: I refuse to stand here and watch you eat somebody's nose!
154416: It's more suitable for the sort of guys who melt at the least
provocation. That ain't you, is it?
154488: The carrot nose is now mounted on the fixture.
154520: It's like a little compass arrow with flat top and bottom.
154564: It has to be lying down before you can do that.
154600: You spin it at random and hear a thunderclap from somewhere nearby.
154648: The lodestone is now lying down in the fixture.
154684: It has to be lying down before you can do that.
154718: northeast.

Revisiting the balmy room, you notice the caskets are
nowhere to be seen, and you smile: even if the rebels attack the House now,
they'll assume their quarry has fled somewhere else
154856: southeast.

Walking out to the clifftop view, you see the army's ford
has been crumbled by the storm and the river swollen to floodspate. They can't
get across it now, and have all the signs of retreating this region for the
moment
155586: This tasteful welcoming-chamber to the House Of Kyub is panelled in
quiet oak and lined with cupboards, perhaps for the storage of coats, boots and
whatnot. Doorways lead south, east, northeast and north. No one seems to be
around.
155754: Do you somehow feel lighter than a minute ago?
155792: Some kind of force prevents you. Whatever it is, it feels warm on your
face.
155848: It's a long, lightweight stocking.
155952: The nylon sock is now spread over the fixture.
155984: It takes a moment to yank the clingy fabric apart ...
156024: It's green plastic, with a little paper umbrella at the top.
156068: The swizzle stick is now balanced in the fixture.
156104: A heavy-looking sandbag. What else can I say?
156140: The sandbag is now shored up against the fixture.
156176: This is not your house. Don't get sand all over it.
156216: You'd say this was the drabbest, most uninteresting room you'd ever
seen, if lots of the other rooms in this House weren't exactly like it. It's
empty except for some kind of molded fixture on the wall, the same color as the
wall. Indistinct openings lead in several directions.
156552: The cold invades your limbs, your bloodstream, your bones. You stop
moving. You stop breathing. Shortly after that, your heart stops too.
156652: You get a few paces and then turn back. It's just too deep.
156696: You get a few paces and then turn back. It's just too deep.
156740: Odd. Even your feet aren't the merest bit wet.
156776: Odd. You're not frostbitten anywhere.
156806: Odd. You're not the merest bit wet.
156836: Instead, a gust blows you against the opposite wall!
156874: Instead, a gust blows you the opposite way!
156908: Some kind of force prevents you. Whatever it is, it feels warm on your
face.
156964: Instead, a gust blows you the opposite way!
156996: A gust blows you up against what seems to be a doorway, but some kind
of heat prevents your entrance.
157066: It looks as though you could put things in it, but it's tough to say
how many things or how large. Its size and shape seem to alter and blur as you
watch. The fixture is flickering in a ghostly way, like a connection might be
failing.
157232: It looks as though you could put things in it, but it's tough to say
how many things or how large. Its size and shape seem to alter and blur as you

157340: You'd say this was the drabbest, most uninteresting room you'd ever

157776: You get a few paces and then turn back. It's just too deep.
157820: You get a few paces and then turn back. It's just too deep.
157864: Odd. Even your feet aren't the merest bit wet.
157900: Odd. You're not frostbitten anywhere.
157930: Odd. You're not the merest bit wet.
157960: Instead, a gust blows you against the opposite wall!
157998: Some kind of force prevents you. Whatever it is, it feels warm on your
face.
158056: Instead, a gust blows you the opposite way!
158088: A gust blows you up against what seems to be a doorway, but some kind

158158: Some kind of force prevents you. Whatever it is, it feels warm on your

158216: Instead, a gust blows you the opposite way!
158248: Instead, a gust blows you the opposite way!

159104: You get a few paces and then turn back. It's just too deep.
159148: Odd. Even your feet aren't the merest bit wet.
159184: Odd. You're not frostbitten anywhere.
159214: Odd. You're not the merest bit wet.
159244: Instead, a gust blows you against the opposite wall!
159282: Instead, a gust blows you the opposite way!
159316: Some kind of force prevents you. Whatever it is, it feels warm on your
face.
159370: Instead, a gust blows you the opposite way!
159404: Instead, a gust blows you the opposite way!
159436: A gust blows you up against what seems to be a doorway, but some kind
of heat prevents your entrance.
159508: Some kind of force prevents you. Whatever it is, it feels warm on your
face.
159562: Instead, a gust blows you the opposite way!
159596: A gust blows you up against what seems to be a doorway, but some kind
of heat prevents your entrance.
159666: It looks as though you could put things in it, but it's tough to say
how many things or how large. Its size and shape seem to alter and blur as you
watch. The fixture is flickering in a ghostly way, like a connection might be
failing.
159832: It looks as though you could put things in it, but it's tough to say
how many things or how large. Its size and shape seem to alter and blur as you
watch.
159940: You'd say this was the drabbest, most uninteresting room you'd ever
seen, if lots of the other rooms in this House weren't exactly like it. It's
empty except for some kind of molded fixture on the wall, the same color as the
wall. Indistinct openings lead in several directions.
160276: The cold invades your limbs, your bloodstream, your bones. You stop
moving. You stop breathing. Shortly after that, your heart stops too.
160376: You get a few paces and then turn back. It's just too deep.
160420: You get a few paces and then turn back. It's just too deep.
160464: Odd. Even your feet aren't the merest bit wet.
160500: Odd. You're not frostbitten anywhere.
160530: Odd. You're not the merest bit wet.
160560: Instead, a gust blows you against the opposite wall!
160598: Instead, a gust blows you the opposite way!
160632: Some kind of force prevents you. Whatever it is, it feels warm on your
face.
160686: Instead, a gust blows you the opposite way!
160720: A gust blows you up against what seems to be a doorway, but some kind
of heat prevents your entrance.
160790: Instead, a gust blows you the opposite way!
160824: It looks as though you could put things in it, but it's tough to say
how many things or how large. Its size and shape seem to alter and blur as you
watch. The fixture is flickering in a ghostly way, like a connection might be
failing.
160988: It looks as though you could put things in it, but it's tough to say

watch.
161096: You'd say this was the drabbest, most uninteresting room you'd ever
seen, if lots of the other rooms in this House weren't exactly like it. It's
empty except for some kind of molded fixture on the wall, the same color as the
wall. Indistinct openings lead in several directions.
161432: The cold invades your limbs, your bloodstream, your bones. You stop
moving. You stop breathing. Shortly after that, your heart stops too.
161532: You get a few paces and then turn back. It's just too deep.
161576: You get a few paces and then turn back. It's just too deep.
161620: Odd. Even your feet aren't the merest bit wet.
161656: Odd. You're not frostbitten anywhere.
161686: Odd. You're not the merest bit wet.
161716: Instead, a gust blows you against the opposite wall!
161756: Some kind of force prevents you. Whatever it is, it feels warm on your
face.
161810: Instead, a gust blows you the opposite way!
161844: A gust blows you up against what seems to be a doorway, but some kind
of heat prevents your entrance.
161914: Instead, a gust blows you the opposite way!
161948: Some kind of force prevents you. Whatever it is, it feels warm on your

162002: Instead, a gust blows you the opposite way!
162036: A gust blows you up against what seems to be a doorway, but some kind
of heat prevents your entrance.
162106: It looks as though you could put things in it, but it's tough to say
how many things or how large. Its size and shape seem to alter and blur as you
watch. Beneath the fixture a stylized sun with rays has been carved into the
wall. The fixture is flickering in a ghostly way, like a connection might be
failing.
162324: It looks as though you could put things in it, but it's tough to say
how many things or how large. Its size and shape seem to alter and blur as you
watch. Beneath the fixture a stylized sun with rays has been carved into the
wall.
162496: The air is so brittle in this white-and-crystal desolation, the puffs
of your outbreaths settle downward with sparkling weight. Your shoes crunch
ice, then have trouble unsticking.
162636: Cold piercing rain and ground-heaving thunderbolts surround you, chill
you, deafen you. Directions of escape are hard to make out through the dark and
pelting sheets.
162764: You're nearly knocked off your feet by the furious gusts of wind that
vie for mastery here. There are exits, but they spin past chaotically as you
swivel and duck to keep your balance.
162900: A lush sun streams down on this delightful region of warm sand, mild
breeze and serenely fluttering shade. You may exit, if you don't know what's
good for you, to the west, north and south.
163036: You can't seem to deal with it directly, though it seems real enough.
163086: Two caskets of what look like dark glass rest here.
163128: Behind the glass you see a squat red-bearded man, asleep. You're pretty
sure this is Kyub himself. The casket bears an inscription.
163222: Behind the glass you see a squat red-bearded man, asleep. You're pretty
sure this is Kyub himself. The casket bears an inscription.
163320: The inscription on the larger casket reads:

"We believe you are
someone to whom the fate of this world matters. We shall remain in this state
as long as the caskets are closed. They can be sent to a protected place if the
lightning is turned toward them, or they will open tomorrow if you choose to
protect this place yourself. We await your decision."
163566: You release Kyub from his chosen hiding place ... but something tells
you that's not really the best thing you could've done. You hadn't explored the
possibilities of the caskets or how they would've fit into the story, and here
you've awakened a character who committed himself to this sleep for a purpose.
I guess you're not the novelist you think you are. Maybe you never were.

Kyub
opens his blond-lashed eyes and stares at you sadly. You kneel and shut your
own eyes, not caring if you wake up in the hotel room or in the land you've so
callously ruined. There's no point in going on now.
163988: Behind the glass you see a delicate but forthright-seeming woman,
asleep. You're pretty sure this is Princess Sephyr herself. The casket bears an
inscription.
164102: Behind the glass you see a delicate but forthright-seeming woman,
asleep. You're pretty sure this is Princess Sephyr herself. The casket bears an
inscription.
164218: The inscription on the smaller casket reads:

"To act is to know where
it leads.
 To act is to be a center.
 Act not, you remain a bundle of
addictions."

(Whoo, that's a wee bit close to home, no?)
164368: You release Sephyr from her chosen hiding place ... but something tells
you that's not really the best thing you could've done. You hadn't explored the
possibilities of the caskets or how they would've fit into the story, and here
you've awakened a character who committed herself to this sleep for a purpose.
I guess you're not the novelist you think you are. Maybe you never
were.

Sephyr opens her dark-fringed eyes and stares at you sadly. You kneel
and shut your own eyes, not caring if you wake up in the hotel room or in the
land you've so callously ruined. There's no point in going on now.
164800: Dark still waters spread to the horizons and it's hard for you to get
far from the door you came in by.
164888: Something seems to be trying to happen here, but you can't tell what.
164940: The path makes a sharp curve such that the way back is northwest, and
falls off steeply toward the south. Narrow and winding, with heartstopping
plummets to each side, this road was obviously made to limit access to the
House and defend it in wartime ... but no defenders seem to be around (if you
don't count yourself).
165164: You wouldn't dream of going nearer the cliffs. Heights are hardly your
thing.
165220: Here the path enters jumbled rocks to the north and bends westward back
up toward the House. The cliffs above you, yellow and soft, are sprinkled with
small bright flowers. You have an expansive, but nicely hidden, view of the
southern plain below.
165396: You wouldn't dream of going nearer the cliffs. Heights are hardly your
thing.
165452: The vast plains are still, but it's the stillness before a storm.
165500: There's activity on the plains. The outriders of what's all too
obviously an army are advancing in lines that seem long even from where you
stand. The lines are also numerous enough to net the plain.
165640: Smoke spirals up from the campfires of an army spread over the plain.
165688: It's a big one, but they're still too far away to tell much.
165732: It's the invading rebel force, and they've got a great selective
service program: the plain is literally thronged with armored men (maybe a few
women, you haven't given thought to that yet). Overkill to be sure, but they've
come for the princess. You see them erecting a ford over the river below.
165944: It's the invading rebel force, and they've got a great selective
service program: the plain is literally thronged with armored men (maybe a few
women, you haven't given thought to that yet). Overkill to be sure, but they've
come for the princess. You see a line of attackers crossing the makeshift ford.
They'll be here in minutes.
166180: Armored soldiers begin pouring toward you and past you. You're laid
hold of in short order, frogmarched to an anonymous sergeant and interrogated.
Your claim to be the creator of the world doesn't recommend you too well, and
the sergeant shortly loses patience and orders you put up against a wall.
166388: They're very pretty.
166404: The flowers don't have an odor to speak of.
166436: Is this quite the time to be weaving garlands?
166468: Red and blue lines of rock run through the ground at your feet and
meander over the rim of the cliff.
166540: Red and blue lines of rock run through the ground at your feet and
meander over the rim of the cliff. The red lines are quietly fluorescing.
166636: Red and blue lines of rock run through the ground at your feet and
meander over the rim of the cliff. Both colors are quietly fluorescing.
166732: Green and red lines run in veinlike patterns through the cobbles of the
plaza. Both colors are quietly fluorescing.
166812: The lines flash with a red that blinds you! Then it dies from your
vision.
166864: The lines flash with a red that blinds you! Then it dies from your
vision.
166916: Blue and green lines of rock lace through the cobbles at your feet. The
green lines are quietly fluorescing.
166992: Blue and green lines of rock lace through the cobbles at your feet.
Both colors are quietly fluorescing.
167064: Green and red lines run in veinlike patterns through the cobbles of the
plaza. Both colors are quietly fluorescing.
167144: The lines flash with a green that blinds you! Then it dies from your
vision.
167200: Red and blue lines of rock run through the ground at your feet and
meander over the rim of the cliff.
167272: Red and blue lines of rock run through the ground at your feet and
meander over the rim of the cliff. The red lines are quietly fluorescing.
167368: Red and blue lines of rock run through the ground at your feet and
meander over the rim of the cliff. Both colors are quietly fluorescing.
167464: Blue and green lines of rock lace through the cobbles at your feet. The
green lines are quietly fluorescing.
167540: Blue and green lines of rock lace through the cobbles at your feet.
Both colors are quietly fluorescing.
167612: The lines flash with a blue that blinds you! Then it dies from your
vision.
167668: The path from the south hairpins in a confusion of jagged boulders and
continues to the southeast at an alarming incline. Once you started on that
slope you'd be hard put to it to stop before the bottom.
167808: You wouldn't dream of going nearer the cliffs. Heights are hardly your
thing.
167864: The way forward stops abruptly at a foaming river of white water,
unthinkable to cross. Might as well trudge back up that scree-path.
167960: You slide to the bottom, as you'd expected, to find the mountain river
forded by a pontoon bridge and soldiers guarding either bank. You're laid hold
of in short order, frogmarched to an anonymous sergeant and interrogated. Your
claim to be the creator of the world doesn't recommend you too well, and the
sergeant shortly loses patience and orders you put up against a wall.
168220: The river is in spate. The only safe thing is to start back up.
168268: Its configurations change like clouds in time-elapse.
168308: You don't even wanna get NEAR the water.
168416: and one marked L. You figure it out.
168444: Suddenly you spot the doorman, Ralph. Ralph is someone you'd rather not
deal with at the moment. Remember why?
168526: Now look, I told you about Ralph the doorman and the whole psychology
of the thing ... I'm not gonna let you do it. Get used to it.
168626: First you gave him a measly tip and he sneered at you. The next time
you gave him a lavish tip and he sneered at you. The third time you ignored him
and he ostentatiously refused to hold the door for you. You had to open it
yourself, with Ralph standing by unoccupied, and some other patrons snickered.
In your current pounded state, such humiliation would be unbearable and fuck up
any value you might derive from the fresh air.
168926: Well, then you don't need me to tell you why you aren't crazy about
facing Ralph at the moment.
169004: Hic. It's a lit-tle bit, a lee-tle beet ... al-co-mo-haul-lick ... but
now we can sing a song, but now we need to lie down, the voice rises better,
and what shall we sing? And who shall we sing it to?

You yawn. Then you sleep.
Then you wake up past your deadline, imagining you really might've finished
your book if you'd kept awake. Nah. To hell with this writer shit anyway.
You're a drunk, is all there is to it. Have a nice rest of your life.
169332: It is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike coffee.
169376: This coffee is barely coffee, more like water. But barely water. It
tastes like the memory of coffee. Memory, so seductive, so productive of light,
lifting thoughts.

You yawn. Then you sleep. Then you wake up past your
deadline, imagining you really might've finished your book if you'd kept awake.
Nah. To hell with this writer shit anyway. You're a drunk, is all there is to
it. Have a nice rest of your life.
169680: Gaaaah! You ain't sposed to drink mouthwash! Do I have to tell you you
choked till you dropped?
169752: It's the recently-used filter full of coffee dregs.
169792: You don't have anything to carry those in!
169824: Filled with fresh coffee grounds, as per your instructions.
169868: Wait! Wait! Stop! There's something wrong!
169904: What a mess!
169914: You reduce the towel to an object better not described. The mess is
about as cleaned-up as can be expected.
170012: The towel is itself an unholy mess after what you've done to it, so
your attempt fails.
170076: Your guilt over the mess gives you a slight heartburn and curbs your
ability to think for a spell. You sit staring at the walls. Then you sleep.
Then you wake up past your deadline, imagining you really might've finished
your book if you'd kept awake. Nah. To hell with this writer shit anyway.
You're a drunk, is all there is to it. Have a nice rest of your life.
170336: Carelessly strewn on the path is a glittering necklace.
170376: The necklace is composed of curious cubical stones. They sometimes
catch, sometimes deflect the light.
170448: Your fist no sooner closes on the necklace than there is a change, a
shift you don't so much feel with your whole body as with the whole world
AROUND your body. You shiver and look up. You're not where you expected to be.
170608: All tendencies to bitch about the room you and your whiskey got stuck
in evaporate as you glance around this miserable place. Barely space for a bed
(this one, however, tidily made) and a bedside table on which are spread a
couple sheets of hotel writing paper, this room's blandness and bareness are
enough to define the adjectives "blandness" and "bareness" in any decent
dictionary. There's a door to the southeast, and you can't wait to throw it
open and get the hell out of here.
170944: There's a shiver down the length and along the breadth of your
surroundings. You blink. Once your eyes are open again, you wish they weren't.
The last thing you're ready for is to be back here, but here, it appears, you
are.
171108: It bears the hated name of your hotel, and a few scrawled lines of
correspondance.
171166: "Dear mother,
     "I know it's been awhile since my last. You know how
it is. The medication seems to help, but I still get times where I don't want
to interact with anyone, I mean say a single word, for fear that word will be
one that loses me my job. A job where I didn't have to deal with people day in
and day out wouldn't be so much at risk when I get like this, or one where the
people weren't these asinine tourists. Rich transients are pretty much like any
transients--no responsibility to this place or to us whose home it is, and only
talk to you when they want something. Just once I guess I ought to check into a
room, stay half an hour, maybe drink one of those ridiculous beers, and see if
I can even begin to figure out"

--and there the letter cuts off.
171712: Cleanliness is next to obsessive-compulsive disorder, you know.
171760: You can't get rid of that in such a fashion.
171792: You can't get rid of that in such a fashion.
171824: There's nothing to place a call on.
171852: There's nothing to place a call on.
171880: You don't remember anything special about that.
171916: You can't talk her into extending the deadline, you've given it your
best shot.
171972: There's nothing the hotel can do for you at the moment.
172012: It's an emergency all right, but not one THEY can fix.
172056: He lived far away from the capital in a mountain hideout. He'd been a
retainer to the royal family, now retired for several years, so he hasn't
figured in--though mentioned in--the previous volumes of the fantasy. He had
nothing to do with the Rebellion, but when the Princess Sephyr needed to quit
the capital in a hurry, he offered his magical House as a refuge. That's how
things stood at the end of the last book.
172352: Haidro, leagues away to the south and west. That's where the fighting
is heaviest.
172412: You've been there, and know its maze of streets and how intense events
are there.
172472: You killed off King Seqwar in the last installment, and Sephyr is the
eldest heir to the throne, since males or females can inherit. You suspect that
one of her numerous cousins has something to do with the Rebellion--that it is
in effect a palace coup spilled over into a civil war--but you haven't worked
that out yet.
172696: You're at your best when you remember specific things or people.
172744: It started a month ago, spearheaded by a vicious elite fighting force
that came out of nowhere, the Crystal Warriors. You haven't decided who they
are or what they mean or, for that matter, who's behind the rebellion. There is
some resistance to it among the citizenry, particularly in the capital.
172956: The Princess Sephyr. You've based her on the most alluring and
unattainable women you know. She seems destined to be an able and beloved
ruler, but you've hinted at other facets of her too--that she belongs to the
secret Society of Makers, for instance.
173136: You once let fall the information, at second- or third-hand, that the
House has no roof because its rooms have their own weather. That's all you
know.
173244: The people call them that because they're never seen without their
faceted reflective body armor. Their faces, in particular, are never seen. Only
one or two of them accompany a rebel army, but no more are needed: they're
superb strategists and tactitians, as well as, reportedly, horrific torturers.
173456: The people call them that because they're never seen without their
faceted reflective body armor. Their faces, in particular, are never seen. Only
one or two of them accompany a rebel army, but no more are needed: they're
superb strategists and tactitians, as well as horrific torturers--as you've
seen.
173672: You prefer to let them be a permanent enigma.
173704: You might learn more about them later on.
173736: From your time with them, you know they're goodhearted people fighting
to protect a family they love, and pretty much in the dark about larger issues.
173840: Even without your help, you intuit they'll be triumphant.
173884: They were triumphant, with your help.
173912: It's barely more than a phrase you've concocted and jotted down. What
does it mean; what WILL it mean? You've got no clue.
174004: You think you're beginning to understand them, a little: but you'll
probably learn more later on.
174076: You're starting to think they control everything that happens here ...
the question is, do they control you?
174156: Since all the books in the series thus far revolved around his ascent
to power and exploits once he got there, you became completely sick of him. You
experienced a twinge, but also vast relief, when you had him die at the close
of the last book.
174324: You don't remember anything special about that.
174360: He came from nowhere, and no one quite understands how he was acclaimed
as leader of the Resistance.
174432: A traitor to the loyalist cause, and a pawn of the Crystal Warriors.
174484: You don't remember anything special about that.
174520: More than a fighting partner, now that you think about it, and more
than a character in your story (or any other).
174684: You don't remember anything special about that.
174720: In rustic areas the citizens attend poetry readings for entertainment.
This was somewhat unbelievable to you in soberer moments, so you've given them
the name "speaking contests."
174848: Sea travel isn't much practiced in the kingdom. Anyway, you haven't
introduced any other continents.
174920: Bluglo, a seacoast market town you've mentioned once as the source of a
popular blue dye.
174984: You don't remember anything special about that.
175020: You don't remember anything special about that.
175056: You don't remember anything special about that.
175092: You don't remember anything special about that.
175128: You have SOME kinda hangup all right.
175160: You need to be at your laptop to do that.
175192: You record your recent experiences, passing them off tolerably enough
as fiction.
175248: You roll back your sleeves, flex your fingers and devote yourself to
the dirty deed. The hands--your own or someone else's?--sail over the keys,
your being is a focused stupor, and at the end of it you have the thing you
have. You have your book.
175424: You've never been able to repair your fortunes by that method.
175480: You're hardly more presentable now, but you probably knew that.
175528: I wouldn't if I were you. I'm not you, but I wouldn't anyway.
175576: If you've ever written anything about, say, Kyub, you can REMEMBER
KYUB.
175640: That's as safe as it's gonna get.
175668: You need to work on the present, not the past.
175768: Now look, there's no call to be doing anything like that!
175812: Excuse me ... do you mind my asking ... WHAT are you talking about?
175866: WO! This is hard to do. You step back a step.
175904: WO! This is hard to do. You totter forward, grimacing and swaying.
175956: There's no point in doing that here and now, is there?
175996: Whee! Round an' round an' round an' round! Do that again!
176040: Ask away! I'd have thought you had better things to worry about.
176088: Your intentions are nice, but you seem only to be able to solve
problems using existing items.
176156: You duck safely out of the way of the ... why is it you were ducking,
again?
176212: Faster than you can blink, you blink your eyes. Hey, wait a minute!
176264: That's as safe as it's gonna get.
176292: Everyone applauds your astonishing ability to stay upright.
176336: Did I miss you being hired as Jim Carrey's stand-in?
176376: Go ahead, greet everything you see. It's a terrific place, your brain!
176428: How many things do you believe are at your beck and call?
176468: I can recommend several good psychiatrists.
176500: The polite thing to do if you're so horny is jerk off, jerkoff.
176548: Whoa, horsie! You might get to giddyap some other day.
176588: That's a thought, but maybe you don't want to identify yourself as the
killer.
176644: You're choking, all right. Can't you think of anything else?
176692: Hey, put this hamburger down! I don't want no malt! I wanna DANCE!
176748: It's cool to be a volunteer ... if there's anything to volunteer for.
176846: nt-fiction, the members of which had to show me how to do almost
everything in the beginning, and not much less as I went along. Any
shortcomings that remain in this game are despite their best efforts.

Nick
Dallett, who had projects of his own to deal with, enthusiastically helped
beta-test the prologue, as did my wife Lee, who if she had her way would rather
not play interactive fiction at all. The first player to complete the game
(that I know of) was George Pappas, who helped me identify a horrid bug.

I
have a special debt to Graham Nelson, original programmer of the Inform
authoring language, whose endlessly instructive and endlessly frustrating
Designer's Manual is a book everyone should be forced to read, if just for the
epigraphs at the start of each chapter.

Andrew Plotkin's game "So Far" taught
me that fantasy stories can be completely impressionistic and still make sense.
