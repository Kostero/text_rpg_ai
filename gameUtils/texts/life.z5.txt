are.

48650: A mighty multi-columned Board shows itself to you.
48806: could be short for "toggle".
It seems that "clear board" is the way to
destroy all living cells on the surface of the board. You also realize that the
only thing required to make this grid become alive would be your speaking of
the word "live".  Wow.
48984: Life becomes death.  Death becomes life.
49016: Welcome to Life!


Life is a game of Cellular Automata. Hardened college
students have ported it everywhere, and now to the Z-Machine.


In Life, the
intrepid Board contains a grid.  Each cell either contains some life (such as
fearsome monsters!) or no life!  Each cell has eight neighbors (except the ones
on the edges).  If a cell has three living neighbors, it will have life in the
next turn; if it has two, it will have whatever it had this turn, and if it has
any other amount, it will be dead next turn.

No Z-Machine should be without
one!
