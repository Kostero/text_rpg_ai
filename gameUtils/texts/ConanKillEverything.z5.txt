"CUT!"
Studio lights flare up, illuminating
the smoke-filled set. The director looks at Conan angrily as the special
effects crew hurries onto the stage. 
"Haven't we rehearsed this often enough?"

He takes the hat.
"I know you're not into technical wizardry, but this should
be REALLY easy!" 
He claps his hands.
"OK, another one!"

"CUT!"
Studio lights flare up, illuminating

crew breaks into heated discussion. 
"I guess our wizard got carried away a bit
here. On the other hand..." 
He looks at you sadly.
"What happened to your
sense of timing?"
He demonstrates a little sequence of steps. 
"One, two,

He walks offstage, clapping his hands.
"OK,
another one!"

Studio lights flare up. The director
rushes onto the set keeping a safe distance to the spider.
"I can't work like
that!" 
He looks at you.
"I think the script is being pretty clear! KILL THE
SPIDER"
He waves at the spider, being pampered by two animal
handlers.
"Shouldn't be a problem, huh?"
He walks offstage, clapping his
hands.
"OK, let's do another one!"

Studio lights flare up. The director

"YOU are the hero, remember? So who's killing

He waves at the golem actor who is being trimmed by a stylist.
"You got

He drags you to your feet and pats your
back.
"Listen, I think you have a great career coming your way..."

"Cut! CUT!"
Studio lights flare up and the crew breaks into
disappointed chatter as the director rushes on stage, carefully avoiding the
fake blood on the floor.
"Sometimes I wonder, how dumb are you really? I mean,
what's this movie called? Conan kill something? Conan kill himself halfway
through? It's EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING, you hear?"
He angrily walks off
stage.
"And you guys clean up the mess and get another blood pack on his
belly!"
80112: an oaken table. The walls consist of yellowish clay. High up on the wall
is a single, burning torch.
80184: A door, leading north, is closed.
80212: Conan cannot walk through walls.
80236: The door is locked. Conan cannot pass through.

80300: Conan hears a very delicate chomping sound from the table.
80340: Conan hears only the quiet crackling of the torch.
80376: Conan fumbles in the dark. Ouch! He steps on the hot torch!
80420: Conan is very strong and full of muscle.
80452: But his sword is broken and dead.
80476: He has a big sword to kill everything.
80504: Conan wears a loincloth made of bear skin to protect him from cold and
emphasize his well-shaped buttocks.
80580: Conan needs something large and sharp to kill himself.
80618: Conan takes the broken blade and holds it before him with both hands.
Then he takes it and with a sudden thrust buries it deep in his muscular
stomach.

Blood flows, as Conan turns and twists the blade in the wound until
he sinks to the floor, dead.
80796: Conan points the sword at his stomach. He gathers strength and then,
suddenly, plunges the blade deep into himself. For a moment all is motionless,
until he topples backwards onto the
80924: Weazle, the evil wizard spins around as Conan enters the room.

"Ha!",
he cries, "here comes stupid Conan whose parents I killed, whose sister I sold
to the orks and whose dumbbells I stole! You want revenge! But you will
perish!" 

He taps his pointed hat, and a growling wildcat appears out of thin
air!
81148: Weazle the evil wizard is a shabby looking old man with a pointed hat.
81196: This is no weapon to attack a wizard.
81224: You try to rush the wizard, but he is protected by his creature!
81272: Finally Conan can attack Weazle. With a mighty blow he slices the wizard
in half. He vanishes in a puff of golden, glittering smoke. Only his pointed
hat falls to the floor.
81396: Weazle takes off his hat and examines it, muttering about something like
'energy plane dysfunction'.
81468: Weazle reaches into his pointed hat and adjusts some dials.
81510: "This is enough!", Weazle exclaims. He taps his head, and Conan vanishes
in a puff of purple smoke.
81588: "Oh", snickers the wizard, "it seems that you have grown stronger since
I burnt your home village! Well, try this!"

He taps his pointed hat again, and
a mighty golem made of wood appears out of thin air!
81738: The wizard is impressed.
"You are good!", he cries, "Better than when I
bewitched your hairdo! But my best creation is yet to come! A giant
tarantula!"

He taps his hat again, and out of thin air, a little spider
appears! The wizard looks a bit puzzled.
81928: It is a muscular animal. Its eyes have a fiery glow.
81966: The wildcat approaches menacingly, long fangs exposed!
82008: The wildcat bites Conan's throat. Blood is all over.
82048: Alertly, Conan draws his sword and, with one quick blow, strikes the
wildcat dead. It vanishes in a puff of brown smoke.
82134: Conan must kill the wildcat with a better weapon.
82172: The golem is a towering, intimidating apparition. Numerous branches
protrude from its body.
82236: Long, heavy wooden branches. Conan wouldn't want to be hit by one.
82284: The golem pounds his chest, rustling and creaking frighteningly!
82330: The golem breaks a heavy branch off his face and throws it at Conan!
82382: A long root whizzes forward from the golem. It wraps around Conan's
throat, strangulating him!
82456: Conan raises his sword again and fells the golem with a single blow. It
shatters into a million leaves that dissolve in a puff of green smoke. A red
apple falls to the floor.
82576: Conan must kill the golem with a better weapon.
82612: It is a little spider with a furry body.
82640: The little spider moves around hesitantly!
82672: Suddenly the little spider freezes in its movements, as if
concentrating.
82724: With a mighty leap, the spider lands on Conan's back. Quickly it bites
into his neck, injecting its venom. Conan falls to the floor.
82820: Conan chops at the spider, but it evades, quickly climbs up the wall and
hides in a crack.
82884: Conan must kill the spider with a better weapon.
82920: The hinges seem to be made of iron. Conan can find nothing special about
them.
82976: A lock with a keyhole Conan has no key for.
83008: A heavy wooden door with metal hinges and a large metal lock.
83052: Conan wildly attacks the door with his sword. After several blows, it
suddenly drops forward and slams flat on the floor - dead. Behind it is only
bare wall.
83196: It is too heavy even for Conan to lift.
83224: The fly is somewhere around, but hard to see in the flickering light.
83344: A fly is buzzing around the room.
83384: Conan tries to hit the fly, but even he is too clumsy to hit it in
midair.
83436: Conan aims and squashes the fly with his sword. Entrails splatter. The
fly is dead.
83496: Conan does not manage to catch the fly.
83524: Conan is too dumb to describe the walls and ceiling any better than that
they really consist of yellowish clay.
83600: But on the ceiling he can see a spider hiding in a crack.
83640: The spider is high up on the wall.
83664: The clay walls are already dead. Conan suspects that he killed them in
an earlier episode.

83978: The little spider is crawling over the floor!
84014: The little spider is eating the fly.
84072: As Conan advances, the spider hastily climbs back into the crack.
84120: With a devastating blow, Conan kills the spider. It vanishes in a puff
of black smoke.
84184: Conan cannot reach the spider up in the crack.
84216: Conan misses and the spider hastily climbs back into the crack.
84260: Conan does not need to. The spider is already dead.
84300: It is high up on the wall, burning with an unsteady light.
84344: Conan jumps and hops, but cannot reach the torch with his sword. The
dead table seems to display a slight smirk.
84424: Conan jumps and hops, but cannot reach the torch with his sword.
84472: Conan does not want to do this - now.
84500: Conan hits the torch hard with his sword. It falls to the floor, dead.
84552: The torch is out of Conan's reach.
84580: A well-aimed throw dislodges the torch which falls to the floor. It
dies!
84632: The only thing Conan really needs.
84660: Conan does not want to do this - now.
84688: Conan grabs his sword by handle and tip and, with all his might, breaks
it over his knee. Ouch! But two fragments remain in his hands, dead.
84816: It is made of bear skin (Conan killed the bear himself).
84860: Conan stabs at his loincloth. Alas! Conan is bleeding to death!
84908: Conan shreds the loincloth to pieces with his sword. It is dead now.
84956: Conan has killed the pin. He cannot put on the loincloth again.
85004: Conan removes the loincloth, held together with a bone pin. Not much is
revealed. Cursed steroids.
85076: Conan puts on the loincloth again.
85100: It is a pin, made of a dead chicken's bone (Conan killed it himself).
85152: Conan does not want to do this - now.
85180: Between his fingers, Conan snaps the pin into two pieces. It is dead.
85232: The table is flat and dead on the floor. There is a small hole on the
side.
85288: It is a sturdy table that has seen many feasts and fights. There is a
small hole on the side.
85356: Conan does not want to do this - now.
85384: Conan jumps up and down mightily on the table. Suddenly its legs break
and it falls to the floor, flat and dead.
85464: Splinters fly as Conan slices the tabletop from its legs. It falls down
flat, dead.
85524: The tiny corpse of a dead worm is in the hole.
85556: There is a tiny woodworm in the hole.
85584: The hole will die when the table dies.
85612: The woodworm is tiny in the hole. Conan can barely see it.
85656: Conan takes the pin and cruelly stabs the worm. Its body goes limp,
dead.
85708: Conan tries to stab the worm with the broken pin, but it is too short.
85760: Conan stabs and slashes with his sword, but he can't reach the worm
inside the hole.
85820: Conan cannot kill the worm like that.
85848: Conan cannot reach the worm in the hole.
85876: A large, pointed hat with a moon and stars decoration that used to be
popular among wizards about 250 years ago. Conan notices an especially large
saturn symbol. Inside the hat Conan can see some dials and blinking lights.
86032: It is a large, pointed hat with a moon and stars decoration.
86076: They blink in a sequence that Conan does not understand.
86116: Somewhat prominent is an especially large saturn symbol.
86156: Conan attacks the hat with his sword. But as he comes near it, he is
jolted by a strong electric current that the hat seems to apply to the sword.
86260: That doesn't work. Conan needs to find some other way to kill the hat.
86312: Conan taps the hat. Oh, no! Conan vanishes in a puff of purple smoke.
86364: Conan taps the hat. It vanishes in a puff of glittering silver smoke!
86416: Conan can find no way to turn the hat off.
86448: Inside the hat Conan can see some dials and blinking lights.
86492: The saturn symbol has a slight smudge. It seems to serve as a kind of
button.
86548: The dials are marked with lettering in a strange writing (but Conan
cannot read at all, anyway). They can obviously be turned.
86640: Conan returns the dials to their original settings.
86676: Being part of the hat, they are protected from violence.
86716: It is a fresh and tasty looking, red apple.
86748: It is a fresh and tasty looking, neatly sliced, red apple.
86792: Conan has already sliced it to pieces. It will not die this way.
86840: Conan slashes at the apple, cutting it neatly into four pieces.
86884: Conan eats the apple. His gastric juices quickly kill it. Conan emanates
a burp of red smoke.
86952: That's just scenery.
88166: "...an apotheosis of the traditional, Zork-led approach to IF..."


"...deconstruction of the room paradigm..." 

"Conan is the barbarian, the
Significant Other against which civilisation defines itself." 

"To say that
'Conan Kill Everything' relies on symbolic vocabulary is to understate the
issue. Its symbols are isolated and recognisable, and stand out from the
landscape in their symbolic significance like a naked guy on steroids in a
Victorian painting. 'Note this!' they say. And they are organised with a tidy
symmetry, perfect and mathematical, so that the meaning of anything unexplained
may be worked out by its relations to other symbols and the oppositions between
them. The sword, the table, the worm, the penis; every object denotes a single
concept in its purity."
