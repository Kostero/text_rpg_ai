19195: Taken.
19206: That makes little sense.
19747: You taste nothing unexpected.
19781: You talk to yourself a while.
19808: This provokes no reaction.
19834: What a good idea.
19860: Futile.
19889: Keep your hands to yourself!
19914: You feel nothing unexpected.
19939: If you think that'll help.

73524: Digging would achieve nothing here.
73552: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
73580: That would scarcely empty anything.

75792: The game file has verified as intact.
75820: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupt.
75864: You are awake, thanks to that phone call.
75984: This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered
haphazardly all over the floor.
76052: Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser.
76084: A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the
living room.
76140: It's just a regular bed.
76160: The room is rank with the stench of death.
76192: Under the bed you see the corpse of the guy who owns this house.
76236: You look and feel much better after your shower. Still not the greatest,
though.
76296: You're covered with mud and dried sweat. It was an exhausting night - no
wonder you overslept! Even making it to the bed before conking out was a heroic
accomplishment.
76484: Putting your soiled clothes onto your clean body would defeat the
purpose of having taken a shower.
76552: Just a simple dresser.
76568: You'll have to get out of bed first.
76600: Not very stylish, but presentable.
76628: You'll have to take off the soiled clothes you're wearing first.
76676: It seems ridiculous to put on fresh, clean clothes when you yourself are
covered with mud and dried sweat.
76752: You can change clothes later. This isn't the time.

old.

Driver's
license photos are generally far from flattering, and this one is no exception,
but this photo looks a lot better than you look now.
77476: It isn't obvious how to use the ID card.
77508: House keys, car keys, they're all on the same chain.
77552: Shirts, pants, the usual.
77572: You'll have to get out of bed first.
77600: These clothes are no cleaner than the ones you have on.
77640: You're already wearing clean clothes - why put on dirty ones?
77684: These clothes are no cleaner than the ones you woke up in.
77724: You'll have to get out of bed first.
77752: You see nothing valuable amid the piles of dirty laundry.
77792: You'll have to get out of bed first.
77820: Just a regular door.
77836: The bathroom lies to the south.
77860: The living room lies to the east.
77884: You're not normally violent - you generally don't even carry a weapon on
these jobs - but the guy lunged at you with a knife and so you had no choice
but to break his neck.
78004: You'd rather not mess around with the corpse - better to just clean up
and get out of here.
78068: This is a far from luxurious but still quite functional bathroom, with a
sink, toilet and shower. The bedroom lies to the north.
78160: The bedroom lies to the north.
78184: It's a toilet like any other.
78208: You've already taken care of that.
78236: Good idea. A few moments and a loud flush later you feel much better.
78288: There's nothing extraordinary about the sink.
78320: Only the shower has any chance of getting you clean at this point.
78368: It's a stand-up shower stall - no tub.
78400: It's generally a good idea to take off one's clothes before showering.
78452: You don't think the watch you're wearing is waterproof.
78492: Carrying your possessions into the shower is a bad idea.
78532: You're as clean as you're going to get.
78564: You step into the shower, turn on the water, and within a few moments
you feel like a new man. But no time to dawdle - you hop back out again and dry
off in record time.
78818: , none of that - but this living room is still nicer than most of those
in this neighborhood. A kitchenette lies to the east, the bedroom to the west
and the front door to the south.
78944: You need to clear out quickly, true, but you look like an absolute wreck
- going out in this condition and drawing the inevitable bewildered stares
would just be making a bad situation worse.
79076: Walking outside naked would probably not be a smart move.
79116: This door has seen better days.
79140: The locking mechanism seems to be broken.
79176: A sofa, some tables, a few chairs.
79204: You don't have time to sit around right now.
79236: The bedroom lies to the west.
79260: The kitchenette lies to the east.
79284: You don't really have time to poke around and cook yourself a fabulous
breakfast right now. Best to keep your time here limited. The exit is west.
79388: Formica, heavily chipped.
79408: A simple toaster.
79424: The Pop-Tart is now nicely browned and piping hot. You wait a moment for
it to cool and remove it from the toaster.
79508: A cinnamon breakfast pastry. It's
79536: It's not Sunday brunch at Le Trop Cher, but it'll do.
79580: The living room lies to the west.
79604: This is quite a seedy neighborhood, but there isn't really anywhere in
the whole Las Mesas metro area that isn't at least a little rundown. Of course,
the locals may complain about the ugliness and the crime, but the fact is that
a starter home like this one would cost easily five times as much in someplace
like Las Playas - and that's if you could find one.

The house lies to the
north.
79880: The house lies to the north.
79900: A car is parked here in the driveway.
79928: The car is parked in the parking lot.
79956: It's a nicer car than one would expect in this neighborhood - a real
eye-catcher.
80016: It's a nicer car than many. You have no complaints.
80056: The keys are lying on the driveway - you'll want those.
80096: The keys are lying on the floor of the car - you'll want those.
80142: You climb inside and realize that you don't have the keys. But no time
to waste - you yank open the access panel near the ignition and hotwire the
car, which starts right up.
80266: You climb inside and start up the engine.
80300: The keys are lying on the ground - you'll want those.
80340: The keys are lying on the floor of the car - you'll want those.
80386: You climb inside and realize that you don't have the keys. But no time
to waste - you yank open the access panel near the ignition and hotwire the
car, which starts right up. You return to the house...
80532: You get back behind the wheel and return to the house...
80576: You switch off the engine and hop out.
80688: Ah, scenic Las Mesas. Man, this place is an absolute toilet. Soon you'll
be able to afford to get the hell out of here - provided you can avoid making
any more slip-ups on the job.
80818: As you cruise down the road, you notice a freeway onramp approaching.
Would you like to get on? >>
80896: You start to change lanes, but you notice that the ramp is out of
service today - some sort of maintenance work. But that's okay - there's
another onramp less than a mile down the road from here. You keep driving.
81048: It turns out that the ramp was blocked anyway - some sort of maintenance
work. You keep driving.
81118: As you cruise down the road, you see the familiar Loungent Technologies
building approaching. Would you like to stop here? >>
81214: You pull into the parking lot and hop out.
81248: Soon the Loungent building is in your rear-view mirror. You keep
driving.
81304: As you cruise down the road, you notice another freeway onramp
approaching. Would you like to get on? >>
81384: You merge onto the freeway, crank up the radio, and vanish without a
trace.
81438: You elect not to get on the freeway, but the idiot in the other lane
decides to give it a try. Swerving in front of you before you can react, he
sparks a collision that ends in a gruesome fireball.
81580: You are at the employees' entrance to the Loungent Technologies
building. There is a slot by the door, next to a sign reading "INSERT ID CARD
HERE".
81696: It's a glass door that says "EMPLOYEES' ENTRANCE" on it.
81752: The door only opens after a Loungent ID card is inserted in the slot.
81804: Pounding on the door won't get you in.
81832: It's a slot for Loungent ID cards.
81860: The slot only accepts Loungent ID cards.
81890: A green LED lights up, the door clicks open and you step inside.
81940: You are standing in a hallway near the back entrance to Loungent
Technologies. The hallway leads north to the reception area and south to the
parking lot, while a door marked "MATTHEW BOWMAN" lies to the west.
82096: Given the circumstances, wandering around Loungent making small talk
with the programmers might not be the brightest idea you've had today.
82192: That note suggested that walking into Bowman's office without the form
wouldn't be very smart.
82260: That note suggested that walking into Bowman's office with an unsigned
form wouldn't be very smart.
82552: The anchorman chuckles. "And now, on the lighter side of the news -
you've heard about the burglar who broke into a home and started stealing the
family's valuables, only to get so worn out from the exertion that he fell
asleep and was caught when the homeowners returned? Here's one to top that: a
burglar broke into an East Las Mesas home, killed the owner and stashed his
body under the bed, put his possessions in the trunk of his car - and then fell
asleep, woke up the next morning, went to his victim's office and tried to do
the victim's job! An insanity defense is likely. And now here with the weather
is Jay Doubleday - or is it?"
83008: You peek into Bowman's office - it's empty. You're tempted to go poking
around, but some glances in your direction from down the hall put an end to
that idea.
83120: You'll have to wait for Bowman to get back.
83152: You won't be able to get back in without your ID card.
83192: It's a glass door that says "ECNARTNE 'SEEYOLPME" on it.
83248: It opens automatically from this side.
83276: There is a cubicle here; it is marked simply "HADLEY".
83324: The walls aren't high enough to give you the slightest bit of privacy.
83376: Three walls which barely rise higher than the desk they enclose.
83420: Looks like the usual junk from here. You'd have to enter the cubicle for
a closer look.
83484: This is a cheap desk attached to the very walls of the cubicle.
83560: Someone passes by the cubicle as you sign the form. You look up just in
time to see Bowman's door click shut.
83640: You hear footsteps as you sign the form. You look up just in time to see
Bowman's door click shut.
83712: A simple ballpoint pen.
83804: It's just a door.
83820: The reception area lies to the north.
83848: The parking lot lies to the south.
83872: Bowman's office lies to the west.
83896: The phone rings.

Oh, no - how long have you been asleep? Sure, it was a
tough night, but... This is bad. This is very bad.

The phone rings.
84042: You suddenly drop dead of internal injuries. Looks like last night was
even tougher than you remembered.
84372: That isn't something you can answer.
84400: There is no shower in this location.
84428: That isn't something you can sign.
84508: In this particular case you'll have to be more specific.
