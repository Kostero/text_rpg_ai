20100: That was a rhetorical question.

51284: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
51316: Sgt. Willie Stevenson, ball turret gunner aboard the B-17 Short Stuff.
51372: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
51432: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
51476: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
51516: I didn't understand that sentence.
51576: That thing is either not in the area, or does not need to be referred
to.
51628: You seem to have said too little!
51652: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
51688: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
51724: You excepted something not included anyway!
51756: You can only do that to something animate.
51788: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

locations (even if you've been there before).
52604: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
52780: As much as you enjoy it, fire isn't the answer.
52816: "Jesus, Allah, Buddha-- I love you all!" You say.
52860: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
52892: Digging would achieve nothing here.
52920: There's your exercise for the day.
52948: You would achieve nothing by this.
52972: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
53000: But there's no water here to carry.
53028: You briefly feel rage... but you choose not to act on it.
53072: There's not enough water to swim in.
53100: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
53128: That would be less than courteous.
53152: Is that the best you can think of?
53176: "Wow, that's a good stress reliever," you think.
53216: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
53256: So tell me, where exactly can you find someone to buy things from?
53304: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
53336: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
53422: "The view, oh God, the view... why the hell would I enlist to the 8th if
I knew this was going to be my position," you think.

Jimmy pops on over the
intercom system. "How you handling it down there, Willie?" And there's that
raucous laugh of Jim's. You grab your throat mic and say, "Not well, Jim, but
I'd like to see you come here and try this. You'll probably shit your
pants."

You hear Tom, your top gunner/engineer, laugh. Sigh... here we go
again.
53776: This is a small, cramped circular space where the ball turret gunners
are located. It can't be more than a meter squared in size, considering the
space that the gun and ammo clips take up. It's complemented with a view of the
ground (which just happens to be five miles down).
53968: You can't leave your post now!
53992: Ugh. It's an unpleasant mixture of smoke, gasoline and -20 degree
Celsius air. Not fun to breathe.
54068: The mechanical whirr of engines as well as the constant radio chatter of
your crewmates.
54128: "Jesus, I could really go for a drink. Or a smoke. Or both." Rob says,
nonchalantly. "Or a nap."
54206: "How about all of the above?" Jimmy says, and laughs.
54250: "Hey, gentlemen, how about keeping our eyes out for Krauts? We're just
finally getting over the Channel now."
54334: "Always the goody-goody, eh Kevin? You belong with the Mama's Boys next
door."
54398: You hear Jimmy laugh. "The lame jokes just aren't stopping," you think.
54456: "Bandits! At 3 o'clock!" Tom says, panicked. "And 9 o'clock! It's a
trap!"
54520: "They're closing in," Tom says, "gotta be about 2000 metres now."
54574: "1000 meters," Tom says. Your heart pounds inside your chest.
54626: "They're opening fire!" That slow motion effect that some of the
sergeants talked about-- you experience it and while doing so you madly start
firing in the general direction of a FW-190.
54764: A scream from the left waist. The right waist gunner, Steve, reports in.
"Jimmy's hit.. bad! Get the bombardier down here now!"
54862: It's too late. Another FW-190 swoops down and empties its' clip on your
tail. Amidst the deafening noise, you hear a variety of things; engines 1 and 3
on fire, fuel leaking at exponential rate, and a report on Jimmy's critical
injuries. You ignore it just as your guns jam and an FW-190 turns for another
pass...
55100: The platform is comprised of two Browning 0.50 calibre machine guns,
which are uncomfortably jammed in an already tight area. The guns extend about
half-a-metre outside the shell of the ball turret.
55240: You grasp the gun trigger. You're pulsing with anticipation.
55284: You fire randomly into the air, hitting nothing.
55318: You can't help but feel pleased at the power you wield.
55360: The bullets, which are huge 0.50 calibre bullets, are currently being
fed into the guns. They're a mixture of armor-piercing and incendiary bullets.
55468: You can't bear to look down. It's just too damned freaky.
55512: You can't bear to think of them. Even the slightest thought elicits
fear.
55564: This is a small cleared area which was created due to the crash landing
of the plane in front of you. Trees which once stood proudly are now scattered
askew. Surrounding you is a dense forest which seems to stretch on for miles
from where your aircraft now lies, except to the north, where your plummeting
plane managed to leave a path.
55796: A dense grove of trees prevents your passage.
55828: You can't fly without an airplane, I'm afraid.
55864: I'm afraid you can't do that, Will.
55892: You wander the forest for a little while before realising its' futility.
55944: You can't see anything!
55962: You can't hear anything, smell anything, see anything, taste anything or
touch anything, and you have no idea who you are or how you got there.
56066: Oh, wait. You can hear. "Wake up, mate." It's Tom. "Come on, get up."
56128: Tom stands here, sorrow strewn on his battered face.
56168: Staff Sgt. Tom Wilkinson, top turret and engineer aboard the Short
Stuff. This is his second tour of duty in the 8th, and usually he's a
battle-hardened veteran, but now he seems different-- almost weaker in a way.
56324: He doesn't respond. Clearly he's somewhere else.
56360: "Such a beautiful plane... I'm really gonna miss her."
56404: "What the fuck?! You don't even have a goddamn scratch on you, when all
the rest of them," Jimmy points to the plane, "all of them were fucked by those
goddamn Nazis!"
56528: "You and me... we're just fine! But then, you find people like Rob..
burned to high hell.." He pauses, and won't continue.
56624: "If I ever find the bastard who shot down the Short Stuff..." He looks
away.
56684: All he does is look away in sadness.
56712: "I found him in the plane," Tom says, "and Christ, he was mutilated. But
why did he burn up and we didn't? I just don't get it."
56812: "Well, I'm no navigator, but I think we were over France just at the
time of the attack. No idea where, though."
56896: "Sorry, Will, I can't give you an answer."
56932: "Listen, Will, I really don't care right now."
56972: "Jesus, Will, what the hell is up with you?"
57008: "Uhh, you just go on ahead, I'll hold down the fort here."
57094: ever created (at least in your opinion). She certainly doesn't look like
she did the day she was commisioned, that's for sure. Bullet holes, small
smouldering fires, you name it, you can find it on the wreckage.
57244: Thanks to your wilderness training, you correctly identify the trees as
white aspen poplars. They're scorched, scattered and broken around where you
stand.
57352: Tom lies dead here, with a gunshot wound to the head.
57392: A surprised expression now permanently grips Tom's face as he lies here.
Blood is caked over both his face and his clothes. Poor guy.
57488: You would never point a gun at Tom!
57514: "What the fuck!? Tom!!" As you gaze upon Tom's dead form, you can't help
but think of one ominous possibility:

"Nazis..."

As you utter the words, you
suddenly notice it-- a cleared path to the south..
57676: It's a picture of your sweetheart, Susanne. God, how you miss her.
57728: Your falling plane managed to clear a path to this dirt road, with its'
own distinct rustic style. Clear skies above lead you to see a farmhouse to the
west while the road continues to the north. A sign on the side of the road
directs you to the nearest town, while to the south the forest looms, ever so
ominous.
57944: You can't fly without an airplane, I'm afraid.
57980: I'm afraid you can't do that, Will.
58008: The road hits you with a wave of nostalgia-- it reminds you of the old
road leading to the old farmhouse where you lived.
58116: It's true what they say-- the French countryside truly is beautiful.
58168: French architecture at its' finest. You can't get more traditional then
this, and it shows-- all the original staples of farm life are here: a well, an
original barn--it's all here. The path continues west into the house, and back
to the road to the east.
58352: You can't fly without an airplane, I'm afraid.
58388: I'm afraid you can't do that, Will.
58416: Despite being in mint condition, this well looks like it hasn't been
used in years.
58476: Once again, it's in impeccable condition, but looks as if no one as
entered it in years. It seems like that's the way it was meant to be-- the
doors are boarded up with wooden planks.
58608: Truly beautiful. Also, it looks familiar somehow.
58644: "What the hell?! Susanne!!" you blurt out.

There she stands, but she's
not moving. It doesn't appear that she's dead... more like she's
frozen.

"Susanne! Baby! Wake up!" But she doesn't move.
58804: You don't know how, but this is EXACTLY the same as your house at home..
every picture, every piece of furniture-- down to the last detail. Upstairs, if
the layout continues, should lead to your room. You can leave the house to the
east.
58980: I'm afraid you can't do that, Will.
59076: Comfortable furniture that was used every time you entertained guests.
59124: Susanne stands here, frozen in time.
59152: You sigh. "So beautiful," you say.
59180: You may be comforted by the action, but she isn't.
59216: You're one sick person, you know that?
59474: to.."

"W--What? Susie, what are you talking about? Susie?" You blink.
Then, like something out of a science-fiction movie, Susanne disappears into
thin air. You stand, gaping, not able to comprehend what has just happened..
59644: Your suspicions are confirmed-- this is your room, exactly as you
remember it. Your bed lies adjacent to the west wall, next to your bedside
table. In the corner is a cardboard box containing your most prized
possessions. A stairwell leads back down to the front door.
59832: You can't fly without an airplane, I'm afraid.
59868: You never liked this bed. It was always so uncomfortable.
59912: A quaint little table that's served you well.
59944: An ordinary cardboard box.
59980: pistol issued by the USAAC. It currently has a full clip.
60024: The letter is written in scribbly writing, and it's addressed to
Susanne:

"Well, you asked for it, didn't you? This letter was written as I sit
inside the B-17, just like you asked. Excuse the messy writing-- it's not
exactly the easiest task. You've always said how much you wanted to see the
view from an airplane, but you'd hate this. It's terrible. Every second I look
down I'm faced with a view of not only the ground, but our vulnerability--and,
dare I say-- my mortality. I want to get out of this place. Not just the 8th,
but the whole fucking country-- there's no place I'd rather be then with you,
and right now I can't bear to even be witho"

Funny.. you don't remember ever
sending this letter.
60540: Usually, the entrance to a town is warm and inviting. In the case of St.
Etienne, it's cold, depressing and foreboding, simply because of a huge iron
gate to the north that blocks the entrance to the city. Behind you is the rural
road that brought you to the town.
60728: You can't fly without an airplane, I'm afraid.
60764: I'm afraid you can't do that, Will.
60792: Clearly the town was frightened of Nazi invasion, and erected this gate
to prevent it. There's no way to see whether the Nazis were successful, but
it's likely that they were; every part of the door is rusted. Yet, still, the
door is locked.
60964: The bullets ricochet off in a random direction.
61000: You can't find a way to open it. Clearly it was designed to only be
opened from the inside.
61064: The grenade twirls through the air before landing in the dirt just in
front of the door. The cataclysmic explosion that results temporarily deafens
and blinds you, but the result is promising-- the door has colapsed, allowing
you passage to the north.
61240: Usually, the entrance to a town is warm and inviting. In the case of St.
Etienne, it's cold, depressing and foreboding, simply because of a huge iron
gate that now lies motionless in the entryway. The town now beckons to the
north. Behind you is the rural road that brought you to the town.
61444: Empty. Completely empty. From the bakery to the church, everything
within St. Etienne has been abandoned. It hasn't been razed-- there are no
bullet holes or shrapnel-- it's as if the town just got up and left. The town
entrance is back down to the south.
61628: Jimmy says, "Stay a while, why don't you?" You feel compelled not to
leave.
61688: You can't fly without an airplane, I'm afraid.
61724: I'm afraid you can't do that, Will.
61752: "Jimmy?! But you died!" you say.
61780: "Rob. The bombardier aboard the Short Stuff. With one press of the
trigger, he manages to kill hundreds--even thousands of innocent civilians just
for what we think is right. But what is "right", Will?
61928: "Jim, think about what you're saying.. you're talking like a fucking
Nazi!"
61986: Jim laughs. "I'm not on either side, Will. I'm on the side that's
'right'." Further laughter. "And you know what I think is 'right'? Blowing up
this whole fucking town!" You suddenly notice that the town isn't abandoned--
all the people are boarded up inside their homes!
62192: "Now you're faced with a choice, William! Do what you think is right and
kill me, your old buddy Jim to save the lives of people you don't know? Or
allow me to blow up this town and save me just because we're good buddies?
Well, what'll it be?" He pauses. "Nah. I'm just gonna blow up the town
meself."

"No!" you scream.
62432: But he activates the detonator, and the town erupts in flame and smoke
and ash; you look around and see people screaming to escape, moaning in agony
and Jimmy, laughing as it all explodes around him. You feel an anger you
haven't felt in a long, long while... you raise your gun and--

and then
something happens. The town-- no, the whole landscape as you can see it--
begins to fizzle, fade and disappear; you think you can see something,
something like a laboratory. You look down, thinking something's wrong with
you, but it's not just you-- Jimmy looks as shocked as you are. All of a sudden
he begins to fizzle, fade and disappear. "N--No!" is all he can manage to say.
Soon he is gone, and then you can hear voices.

"said this would never happen"
and "overload in computer processors one through eight" and "too much
information being processed", whatever those words mean. The people inside the
buildings, they can hear the voices too-- and as they escape from their burning
buildings they manage to look to the now disappearing skies and say "It is a
miracle!!" in what little French you can understand. "God has come to save us!"
And the people rejoice, but you know that this-- whatever this is-- can't be
God.. No.. it's something different. And then you begin to fizzle, fade and
disappear...
63372: Jimmy stands in the middle of the street, staring at you slowly and
resolutely.
63428: He looks different somehow-- besides the fact that he's caked in blood,
his normally fun-loving profile has been replaced with a cold, calculating
exterior.
63540: There's one familiar thing about Jim-- that raucous laugh, mocking you
with every sound.
63604: You can't attack Jim-- this is your buddy we're talking about!
63652: "I don't take orders from you, Stevenson. Not any more."
63696: He doesn't respond, nor does he seem to care.
63732: It's boarded up completely, and there's no evidence of any products in
the window.
63792: Completely dilapidated, just like the barn-- looks like no one's been in
it for years.
63856: Silent, except for Jimmy and you.
63884: The forest, which was so dense as to be deemed impenetrable, is now
cleared out. The remainder of the trees that once existed here now bask in the
bright glow of the sun, having only been alluminated by miniscule shafts of
sunlight. The path continues to the south, and the smouldering wreckage of your
plane can be seen to the north.
64116: You can't fly without an airplane, I'm afraid.
64152: I'm afraid you can't do that, Will.
64180: A dense grove of trees prevents your passage.
64212: The white aspen poplars glisten in the sunlight.
64248: The path continues through this dense forest. If not for the cleared
path you now stand on, you'd be hopelessly lost in this forest which likely
dates back hundreds of years.
64368: You can't fly without an airplane, I'm afraid.
64404: I'm afraid you can't do that, Will.
64432: A dense grove of trees prevents your passage.
64464: The white aspen poplars glisten in the sunlight.
64564: You're relieved to know that the boys up there bagged at least one
Kraut. The FW-190, definitely the Luftwaffe's best plane, now lies wrecked
beyond repair. A smile crosses your face as you gaze upon it.
64712: You can't fly without an airplane, I'm afraid.
64748: I'm afraid you can't do that, Will.
64776: A dense grove of trees prevents your passage.
64808: A Nazi pilot lies here, slumped up against his fallen plane. He has one
gunshot to the head.
64876: You grin as you look at his bloodied corpse.
64908: The white aspen poplars glisten in the sunlight.
64944: Whoever downed this plane did a hell of a job-- the entire tail of the
plane is completely shot to hell, yet the front end is relatively intact,
including the cockpit.
65060: This grenade, colourfully known as a potato masher, pack much more of a
destructive force than the usual "pineapple" grenades you're used to. Luckily
it didn't explode when the FW-190 went down.
65200: "Can you at least restore him?"

"Yeah, I think I can."
65248: A plain, ordinary white room, except for the numerous metal boxes (which
are making ungodly noises) and what looks like glass windows, except there are
words on them all. Wherever you've gone, it's a strange, strange place.
65406: "W--Where the hell am I? What the fuck is going on?"

A man wearing a
white labcoat and glasses comes over to you. "Whoa, sir, calm down there.
There's a perfectly good explanation for all this."

"There damn well better
be," you say.
65706: lation)."

"What? No! I'm exactly who I think I am. Wille Stevenson...
right?"
65774: "No.. you're an ETO. We created you--"

"Created? No! This is all
bullshit! Utter bullshit!"
65856: The second one turns to the first one. "This was a terrible idea. He's
not taking it well. Let me take him offline." The first one says, "No. Let me
keep going with this." Turning to you again, he continues. "You can call me
Frank, and he's Graham. We're extremely close to figuring out the mysteries of
the human brain-- a major breakthrough in medical science. We're so close!" You
look down. This can't be, you think.
66168: "But, since that new law was introduced in Congress, we're not allowed
to do any experiments on living subjects. Not even ones like cardiovascular
response. So, we did the next best thing-- created extrapolations that we can
experiment on in any manner. It gets around every law they can throw at us--
and all for the benefit of science."
66408: The second one looks at you. "Plus," he grins, "now we can create
scenarios and occurences we'd never be able to do with normal subjects. Such as
your World War II scenario." The first one continues. "Exactly. Everything you
experienced since your plane crashed--Tom's death, the pilot's death, the
seemingly impossible reincarnation of Jimmy-- all designed so we could monitor
your cardiovascular response, neurological response, plus your reactions to the
events we set up with you (such as fear, anger, hatred, and so forth)."
66826: No. This is some Nazi plot, isn't it? Let me out of here! Let me go, you
fucking bastards!"
66896: "I'm telling you! We're not Nazis. Here, maybe it'll make some more
sense if you ask me a few things about your life, your experiences-- anything.
Go ahead and ask. Anything at all."
67032: They're making weird noises, and the balding man is looking at one. Best
not to touch them, especially when you don't know what you're doing.
67132: I told you NOT to touch them, stupid!
67164: A short man with a nametag that simply says "Frank" on it stands before
you.
67220: He's a short man who is currently wearing a labcoat. He seems nervous
and stressed as he stands, and is constantly cleaning his glasses.
67316: Frank turns to Graham and says, "Must be World War II fighter talk."
Graham nods.
67380: "Oh, that was just some town we found in an old history book. Not worth
making a fuss over."
67448: "Why'd we pick the World War II scenario? I don't know," he responds,
"Lots of hate between the two sides, I suppose."
67540: "You mean-- everything I've experienced didn't really happen? My
childhood?"

"Essentially, yes. We speeded up that process. You experienced it.
We didn't."
67664: "Those are computers. I.. don't suppose you know what that is." You just
continue to look puzzled, and then Frank finishes: "Yup, I thought so."
67776: "Oh, I'm just a psychological analyst working on this project. Graham's
the man who puts the ETO program together."
67864: "Sorry, sir, I don't have any idea what you're talking about."
67912: "Uhh..." He looks over to Graham. "Do YOU have any idea what he's
talking about?"
67980: "Uhh, I'd rather stay here, thank you."
68012: A balding man also sits in front of a glass window, reading it.
68056: He seems very interested in what's showing up on the glass screen.
68104: Graham turns to Frank and says, "Must be World War II fighter talk."
Frank nods.
68168: "Uhh, you better ask Frank; he's our psychological analyst, I'm just the
hardware guy."
68236: "Uhh..." He looks over to Frank. "Do YOU have any idea what he's talking
about?"
68304: "Uhh, I'd rather stay here, thank you."
68506: --"

He's interuppted by flaring red klaxons and a loud voice over the
loudspeaker: "Security breach! Security breach! Dr. Kenny and Dr. Nichol, to
the front office please!" Frank and Graham run out in a hurry, and as the door
opens you can see Susanne in an adjacent room! You run out and meet her, giving
her a loving embrace. "Susanne? But how?!" She quickly shushes you and says
quietly, "Come on. I'll explain while we get out of here."  Spotting a back
exit, you two make your escape...
69288: 7 again."

You grin and respond, "Just tell me what I need to do,
Doc!"




"When I meant anything, I didn't mean THIS!" you grumble as you
continue to mop the floor outside of Frank's office.
70034: "What the hell? Did you program it to do that?" The man looks over to
his co-worker, who shakes his head. "But take a look at this code!" Thinking
he's talking to you, you step over to one of the weird sounding machines. What
shows up on the screen looks something like this:
70468: As soon as you read it, you realise-- "Oh SHI--"
70512: "What the fuck was up with Jimmy? Why'd he do what he did?" you
say.

"Oh, that was used to measure how much information your system could
take, no matter how impossible it could be. Same with Susanne..."

"Can you
restore Jimmy?" you say to Graham. "I.. think so. Gimme a sec." He types for a
while, and then Jimmy appears in front of you.

It's the old Jimmy you
remember. "Willie! Buddy! How's it going, big guy?" You stare him down coldly,
then punch him in the face. He's more surprised then injured, and he throws you
off him. "Will, what the fuck's gotten into you?" You aren't convinced. This is
the same Jimmy that tried to blow up a French town, even if it was just an
"extrapolation". You charge him and continue fighting. The noisy machines fall,
equipment is shattered, but all Frank can do is take out a clipboard and start
scribbling notes. "Fascinating!" he says.
71166: "So tell me then," you say, "who killed Tom? And that pilot?"

Both of
the men look uneasy. "Well, uhh, well..." Frank stammers, "you see, the
extrapolation program we built can't handle that many ETO's... so we couldn't..
we couldn't.." Graham interrupts Frank. "Just show him the footage." Frank nods
slowly and ushers you over to one of the glass windows.

There you see it all
in perfect detail; Tom moping around the wreckage of the Short Stuff, Frank
walking up slowly, a few words of conversation, Tom turns around, Frank raises
a gun and blasts his brains out. In shock, you watch the camera angle to change
to the wreckage of the Nazi plane. Graham walks up, a few words of German are
spoken, and Graham blasts his brains out. You look up in rage. The hate you
feel transcends all hate you've felt before. Previously, you despised Nazis and
everything they stood for. But now both sides were dead-- victims of a cruel
experiment.

"Maybe we're all the same after all," you say to Frank and Graham.
Then you grab Frank's throat, and continue to squeeze. He struggles to breathe,
but you show him no remorse. Graham begins to call for security, but you drop
Frank and start beating the hell out of both of them. Soon, they both lie in
crumpled forms in front of you. Your heart races. You don't care what happens
to you now. You feel redemption, and redemption is sweet.
72174: "No! I don't believe you! You're Nazis!" you scream.

Both men sigh.
"Tell Mike I thought he did a bang-up job on the personality subroutines, but
this one's too nationalistic." Frank turns to Graham. "Delete him." Graham
nods.

You stare down both men, slowly and resolutely. "Tell your Fuhrer I said
hello," you scowl. Frank rolls his eyes, and Graham hits a button. Then all
fades to black.
