39050: Your prayer is sent.

Some deity misunderstands you and sends down to
you five chickens and a cow, all of which immediately run away.
39268: Your prayer is sent and received through the proper channels, noted and
cataloged, stamped with the date of which it was received, sorted in order of
priority and then of request, re-routed several times to different departments,
and by the time it reaches The Big Guy Upstairs(TM) you've already gone and
solved your own problem yourself.

No, this isn't a remake of "Bureaucracy".

40045: Oh, don't apologise.
40067: You're playing this game, you're damned already.
40135: We're not here to discuss your diet.
40167: Quite.
40179: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
40213: There's not enough water to swim in.

40838: Nothing is on sale.
40884: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
40922: Time passes.
40938: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
41048: No need to pick it up now.
41394: No big loss to humanity, I tell ya.
41523: Sure, that looks non suspicious, a psychopath attacking a phone booth.
41595: Whatever.
41614: You've no need to pull it now that it's fallen over.
41978: You've already pushed it over, dumbass.
42035: You give the damn phone booth a mighty push and watch as, in a brilliant
slow-motion display, it topples over, glass sides shattering onto the lawn,
welded door crumpling under the impact, the phone itself flying off the hook
and landing pathetically in a mass of metal and plastic. You have the distinct
feeling that the booth will bother you no more.
42289: The act of pushing the phone booth over has opened it up, in a sense.
42381: The door is all bent, there's no way you can close it now, even if you
wanted to.
42456: Duh.
42469: A familiar sound now comes out of the phone's receiver, lying
pathetically on the ground.  You glare in satisfaction as you to the repetitive
BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP sound and then as the recorded voice of the Operator, the
person you're going to marry someday, comes on and says...

"... if you would
like to make a call, please hang up and try again.  If you would like to make a
call, please hang up and try again ..."
42810: Yay!
42963: ,






And so you were taken from this place to another place, where
you had absolutely no damn idea what it is you're supposed to be doing.  It's
OK, you'll be all right.  Just don't pick up the phone booth, or else you'll
die.

43460: You can't go that way.
43536: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
43568: As good-looking as ever.
43684: Like most any other nondescript New England towns, there's not much to
see or do here, but maybe you'll find something amusing and enjoyable to do.
43788: A shiny metal phone booth sits in the center of the square.
44188: No longer will you need to push it over.
44220: A fallen phone booth lies, crumpled, on the ground.
