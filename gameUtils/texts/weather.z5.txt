38137: That's plainly inedible.
38170: Not bad.
38186: That was a rhetorical question.
38214: This dangerous act would achieve little.
38248: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
38284: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.

38720: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
38754: There's not enough water to swim in.

38820: You can't usefully blow that.
38874: No, you can't set that.
38898: No, you can't set that to anything.
38961: But you aren't holding that.
39026: It is fixed in place.
39048: You are unable to.

39122: That's not a direction.
39141: Not that way you can't.
39191: You achieve nothing by this.
39222: Futile.
39229: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
39278: You talk to yourself a while.

39395: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
39433: Time passes.
39449: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
39534: Sitting around won't speed matters.
39578: You smell old dirt and, perhaps, things that once lived in here.
39647: You're not asleep.
39662: You're certain you're not asleep.
39752: You hear the rushing of the stream.
39793: You hear the rushing of the unseen stream.

39937: Sleeping out in the rain would be miserable.
40015: Sleeping out in the rain will be miserable, but you're tired enough to
do it.
40078: a. You take the wet blanket (much good it will do.) Wrapping yourself
soggily, you curl up in the mud,
40285: You awaken, soaked and feverish, bathed in the listless light of an
overcast dawn. It takes some time to drag yourself down the hill -- and then
you find that the bridge has been washed out by the storm. By the time you
flounder across it, your pneumonia is well set in.
40490: You curl yourself up as best you can.
40522: It's dry in here, but you're still cold. You even wish you still had
that ratty blanket.
40653: Nonetheless, you try to close your eyes...
40699: You awaken sore and cold, bathed in the listless light of an overcast
dawn. It takes some time to drag yourself down the hill -- and then you find
that the bridge has been washed out by the storm. By the time you wade across
the swollen stream, you're as soaked and miserable as if you'd slept out in the
rain after all. You reach civilization exhausted and with what promises to be a
lovely cough.
41063: curl up on the floor. It's hard, but you're dry and warm. What else
could you ask for? Your eyes close and the cave drifts away...
41181: Something awakens you.
41245: The sun is sinking slowly in a clear blue sky. It's the end of a long,
long summer afternoon.

41359: A few bands of cloud are visible on the western horizon, lit by the
reddening sun.

42024: Everything smells of rain, and wet growing things.
42066: The air is thick with rain and electricity.
42102: The dawn air is indescribable.
42125: The air smells of a combination of cream cheese and A-1 Steak Sauce. You
are unnerved to find it appetizing. [BUG]
42219: Metaphorically appealing, but hopeless in practice.
42335: A no-time, eternal instant of light lances through you, snapping your
mind to silence.
42458: Crack!
42556: You are getting tired.
42604: You are very tired.
42719: The sun is lazily approaching the horizon.
42765: The sun is settling to the horizon, amid a scattering of clouds which
have begun to drift in.
42842: People seem to be be packing up to leave. Since they seem as likely as
not to leave you behind, you hurry back to the group. Eventually some people
ask you where you've been; you shrug them off irritably, and they leave you
alone.
43024: The western horizon has become a surging sea of gold and scarlet waves.
The light is magical -- a cool bronze radiance that somehow makes the grass and
foliage more intensely green than ever.
43172: The moment is gone. The sun has set, although the clouds are still
well-lit.
43244: The sky is dimming, and a mist is rolling in, under the clouds.
43306: The mist is turning to a drizzle of rain.
43357: It's dark and it's raining.
43396: It's dark and it's raining. Hard.
43436: You can remain awake no longer.

down to the stream below.

trickle left.

45413: Sparing you only an unreadable glance, the fox leaps for shore and
vanishes into the night.
45478: The side of the bridge sags further, beams bending.
45522: Crack!
45532: You stretch your hands helplessly towards the bridge, but the timbers
are falling, slower and slower, silent behind a freezing roar that rises in
your mind...
45688: Crack!
45698: You know without seeing that the bridge has been destroyed. You begin to
rush downhill, but the trail seems to stretch and time takes on the weight of
nightmare...
45839: The runoff water is pouring down to the stream, right over the bridge
pilings. The muddy earth below the bridge is wearing away.
45947: A beam below the bridge suddenly slips from its mooring in the earth! It
vanishes into the raging current. One side of the bridge begins to sag, bowing
almost gracefully towards the water.
46093: The runoff water is pouring down to the stream, right over the bridge
pilings and your makeshift support. The earth below the bridge continues to
wear away.
46219: The bank has melted from under the branch; it slips into the stream and
is whirled away. The bridge begins to bend once again.
46353: The trickle of rainwater coming down the east path gains strength.
Rapidly it becomes a small torrent.
46456: The torrent of runoff slackens sharply; in moments there is only a
trickle left.

of geography. It puddles on the ledge, then begins pouring down the path to the
northwest.
47670: Runoff water is trickling down the hill, concentrated here by some twist
of geography. It puddles on the ledge, behind the fallen tree, then flows
southwest. [BUG]
47903: The runoff water begins to spill out from behind the tree, down the
southwest path.
48010: . Your eyes explode. [BUG].
48058: The pure white fades into a greenish glare. Flat colored shadows show
the outlines of everything around you; you hold your head still to focus on the
afterimages.
48185: .
Afterimages hang around you in a greenish glare. You blink furiously,
trying to sort out the shadows from what's really there.
48311: The afterimages of what you saw float around you.
48498: The afterimages are standing around, chatting idly and smoking
cigarettes. They see you and hastily leave. [BUG]

48839: , too faint to make out but too loud to ignore. You are almost certain
you hear your name, though, and something in you moves to respond.

they say, but something inside is terrified that they are calling for you.
49103: The voices are still audible. They surge and swell, on the edge of
audibility, somewhere to the west. You are almost certain you hear your name
being called.
49231: The voices surge, and you realize the sounds comes from the west, from
the other side of the stream. And they are coming closer. You are very sure,
suddenly, that you do not want them to reach you.

interest.

49896: The fox spares you no attention.
49921: Without seeming to move, the fox is out of your way.
49992: The fox wags its tail merrily, then crouches down expectantly and waits.
50046: An ear perks up; but then the fox shakes off a spatter of water and
sneezes. Truth be told, you feel rather the same way yourself.
50149: The fox looks at the spade shaft lying on the ground, then back at you
with some perplexity.
50214: The fox looks around, then back at you with some perplexity.
50267: The fox spares you no attention.
50317: The fox wags its tail merrily, then crouches down expectantly and waits.

50766: The fox spares you no attention.
50811: The fox's ears perk up and its tail wags, a perfect picture of puppyish
enthusiasm. Its eyes laugh at you as it gathers itself expectantly.
50913: An ear perks up; but then the fox shakes off a spatter of water and
sneezes. Truth be told, you feel rather the same way yourself.
51055: The fox spares you no attention.
51142: The fox dodges in a blink, and then spears you with a disappointed
stare. It vanishes into the undergrowth.
51279: 0 axn
You jerk as a shape darts past you. Wild orange fury -- it's the

something you hold.
52599: The fox blinks.
52753: The fox darts at something in the undergrowth.
52795: A channel has been cut from the path down through the bank. The earth is
deeply eroded, as if something had worn it away.
52880: There's a narrow spot in the bank, a thin ridge of earth between the
inundated path and the stream below. The pool of water behind your pile of
sandbags just reaches the thin spot.
53227: You tear at the earth, heedless of your burning fingers. A stone yields,
and then another; and then a third is sucked from beneath your hands, pulled by
the current that is rushing along your channel. You lean back, choked breaths
lost in the rain that drums on your face. The standing pool on the path is
rapidly subsiding.
53458: A flash of movement draws your eye. The fox is still on the bridge, but
no longer crouched in readiness. It stands tall, looking at you with a
wide-jawed fox grin; and then faces west, into the voices that have gone high
with triumph. They come closer, closer, along the bridge that you have labored
to save.
53726: You awaken, blinking in light.
53857: You make only a shallow channel in the bank.
53899: The channel becomes deeper.
53929: The gap has nearly reached the level of the water standing on the path.
53989: A thread of water begins to trickle out along your channel.

wide, and water is pouring out of it, down to the greater channel that roars
below the bank.
54187: Yip!
54195: Your eyes snap to the fox, to find it staring as urgently back at you.
It tilts its head towards the path. What?
54291: at the curve of the path, where the water has backed up behind your pile
of sandbags. There's a narrow spot in the bank -- a thin ridge of earth between
the inundated path and the stream below.
54430: It is too dark to see.
54455: The grasses are fragrant under the sunshine of a late, late summer
afternoon. A stream chatters by at your feet, and a weathered old wooden bridge
stretches across it to the east. Beyond the stream, a scrubby hillside
stretches upward.
54625: The grasses are fragrant under the sunshine of a brilliant summer
morning. A stream chatters by at your feet, and a weathered old wooden bridge

54878: The bridge creaks as you cross it, and sways a bit.
54922: The stream is that way.
54950: The stream is that way.

companions. One of them waves hugely to you. You shrug, and begin jogging
towards them.
55143: You turn your back on the hill, and consider the distant shapes of your
companions. One of them turns and calls your name. Others point, and wave, and
laughter and shouts precede them flowing across the meadows.
55292: You smile to yourself, and begin jogging towards them.
55338: You'd rather not rejoin the group at this point. For one thing, you have
no desire to explain what you were doing wandering off by yourself.
55490: You hear the noise of your group off to the west! Half of them seem to
be setting up for the volleyball finals; the others are building the campfires
that will burn tonight.
55616: The shouts of the volleyball players and the boom-box thump are not
quite audible to the west.
55702: A slope descends to the noisy stream to the west. The old wooden bridge
which spans it leans
55798: against the bank at your feet. To the east rises the flank of the hill,
56071: The bridge creaks as you cross it, but it's solid.
56117: The thought of crossing into that darkness, with its inhabitants, is
beyond bearing.
56183: You'd rather not rejoin the group at this point. For one thing, you have
no desire to explain what you were doing wandering off by yourself. For
another, you're not so sure you trust the bridge.
56320: You'd rather not go look for the group at this point. For one thing, you
have no desire to explain what you were doing wandering off by yourself. For
another, you're not so sure you trust the bridge.
56462: The stream is that way.
56490: The stream is that way.
56518: The stream is that way.
56577: A narrow span of weathered wood crosses the stream here. A major beam
has fallen away, leaving a dangerous gap in the row of supports, and the bridge
sags crazily as you watch.
56705: A narrow span of weathered wood crosses the stream here. The boards are
vaguely warped, and the whole has an air of uncertainty about it.
56824: A sturdy branch has been jammed under the bridge, filling a gap in the
row of supports.
57002: A narrow span of weathered wood crosses the stream here. The boards are
vaguely warped, and the handrails aren't quite connected each to the next, but
it's held this long and you expect it will probably support you.
57153: A narrow span of weathered wood crosses the stream here. The boards are
vaguely warped, and the handrails aren't quite connected each to the next.
You're not sure you want to trust it.
57301: The bridge isn't very high. Between the bridge supports and the high
bank, your feet would be in the stream, and the rest of you in the mud.

58077: There's no place under the bridge to wedge the branch.
58143: You wedge the branch under the bridge, in the gap left by the missing
support beam. It seems to be holding.
58308: It's not particularly deep, but it's spectacularly clear. Streaks of
green trail along the stones at the stream's bottom, and you see the rare glint
of a fish in the sunlight.
58438: It's not particularly deep, but it's spectacularly clear, and the rich
light turns the river-stones to copper, brass, and gold. Finned gems dart among
strands of moss too vibrant to be jade.

miserable.

59126: It's storm-swollen and rapid, and certainly dangerous.
59172: Recklessly, you leap into the swollen stream. Though the water is less
than hip-deep, it knocks you immediately from your feet. The rest is a
nightmare of darkness, cold, and numbing impacts.

meadowland, patched with the dark emerald of forest. The streams are already
shadowed in their beds. In the distance, a lake reflects red fire, beneath the
greater fire that leaps silently on the horizon.
60637: The park stretches off to the north and west, a vast expanse of dimming
meadowland, patched with dark woods and stitched with dark streams. In the

feet.

64593: You wind up and hurl the stick into the undergrowth. The fox turn to
watch it fly, and then looks back at you. Its expression is quite clear: if you
want the stick lost in cold, dripping-wet vegetation, that's entirely a matter
between you and the stick.
64779: You wind up and hurl the stick into the undergrowth. The fox doesn't
even turn; its attention is focussed on something out in the darkness.
64897: Dropped. The fox watches it fall, then looks up at you with some
disappointment.
64961: Dropped. The fox watches it fall with vague, sodden interest.
65022: That's odd. The steel key doesn't seem as rusty as you first thought.

pitted with rust.
65221: It's a small steel key, rather cheap-looking. It's slightly rusty.

go along with it. It tenses to spring, and you hurl the key far back into the
undergrowth. With a yip the fox streaks after it.

feet.
65540: You wind up and hurl the key into the undergrowth. The fox turn to watch
it fly, and then looks back at you. Its expression is quite clear: if you want
the key lost in cold, dripping-wet vegetation, after all the trouble the fox
went to to find it, that's entirely a matter between you and the key.
65756: You wind up and hurl the key into the undergrowth. The fox doesn't even
turn; its attention is focussed on something out in the darkness.

The crimson gold above the horizon is met and matched by a green which burns as
bright, a living furnace of trees reaching in solemn exaltation to the clouds.

of stone and soil, cool with the flavor of growing things.

two-and-a-half feet across.
67968: epm
In the shadow behind the boulder, you notice an edge of deeper
blackness. It's a cave of some sort.

to give you any leverage.

68584: You push the spade under the boulder, kick the blade to settle it, and
lean on the shaft. Nothing happens for a moment, and you're leaning harder, and
the boulder starts to move, and
68718: Crack!
68728: The spade's shaft has broken off in your hands, right above the blade,
which is now caught under the boulder. On the other hand, you've moved the
boulder up out of its hole; it's balanced on the rim.
68878: The blade isn't long enough to give you any leverage.
68922: The shaft is too thick to wedge under the boulder.

by hand.
69049: The blade isn't long enough to give you any leverage.
69093: The shaft is too thick to wedge under the boulder.
69143: You heave at the boulder a few times, but it's clearly not going
anywhere.
69213: As you lean over the boulder, you notice a cave of some sort behind it.
69266: You grasp the boulder as best you can and heave -- fruitlessly. It's
well sunk into the ground.
69359: That's unclear. Try a compass direction.
69403: You grasp the boulder as best you can and heave. The boulder thumps
neatly back into the hole it came from.

the hill to the south, curving west with the slope. A few moments later you
hear a small

a rending
69907: Crack!
69927: You feel a freezing rush down your back, and you know without seeing
that the bridge below has been destroyed. You begin to rush downhill, but the
trail seems to stretch and time takes on the weight of nightmare...
70084: A sudden wave of nerves pulls you downhill after it....

You were right;
the bridge has been neatly demolished, and the boulder sits innocently in the
stream, in the wreckage. So much for your little exploration. You go off,
resigned, to tell the park rangers what you've done.
70307: Everything under the boulder seems stuck to it. [BUG].
70384: You can only see a few inches of dark emptiness behind the boulder.

is not quite high enough to stand in, but surprisingly long, narrowing only
slowly towards the back. The entrance is a

twig and old leaves.
71162: Nonetheless, it looks warm.
71224: The blanket flaps nicely.
71246: The blanket flaps heavily. A few drops of water fly off.
71299: You squeeze a trickle of water out, but the blanket is still nothing
like dry.
71368: A daemon crawls out of the blanket and shouts "Hey! Who soaked my
blanket?!" [BUG]
71528: The blanket has gotten quite soaked.

squeeze out past it.

71678: From inside the cave, you can't get enough leverage to push any
direction but straight out.

the brush. Here you have found a profusion of them. Sprays of white and blue
lie everywhere; the vines ripple yellow.

72666: Beyond a slight rise to the west, the ground drops precipitously to the
stream. A trail leads northward towards the bridge; another heads steeply up to
the east, and a third curves around the hill to the southeast.
72822: The trail turns northeast as it climbs.
72858: You have barely left sight of the wildflowers when the trail ends. It
looks like it was washed out; and the scree that covers the hill face is much
too unstable to venture across. You have no choice but to return.
73039: A glint in a nearby bush looks more metallic than floral.
73105: A battered tin bucket stands nearby.

tap water, but an indefinable vitality.
74151: The water splashes on the ground and dribbles away.
74347: You splash the water around the spade. The mud absorbs it greedily.
74404: You splash the water around the blade. The mud absorbs it greedily.
74503: You splash the water into the mud. In this rain, it's an impressively
useless maneuver.

the stream below.

The water dribbles away, and the fox looks up at you piercingly, as if having
second thoughts.

77766: acwfxn slips into the crack. You stretch and give it a couple of whacks,
to wedge it in place.
77844: acwfxn is too tightly wedged into the crack. The shaft bends slightly;
perhaps you can pull it free.
77970: acrfpm would achieve nothing. Perhaps you want to throw it over the gap
in the trail?
78059: Among the hill's brush and scraggly trees, the tree that stands here
stands alone. You might be able to get your arms around it, and you might not;
it must reach nearly as high as the hilltop itself.
78205: The lone tree has been laid low. About ten feet still sticks up from the
ground; the rest lies across the path and downslope, splintered and scorched.
78323: It's certainly the tallest thing you can see in any direction. You have
no hope of figuring out what species it is.
78407: The tree has fallen downslope, across the path, and is lying awkwardly
in the undergrowth. The upper end -- which is to say, the lower end -- is
blackened and split.
78540: The trunk is smooth and the lowest branch is at least twenty feet in the
air.
78603: You look at the blackened remains of the tree. Perhaps it's true that
lightning never strikes in the same place. And perhaps you'd be quick-roasted.
Either way, there's not that much left to climb.
78747: There's not that much left to climb.
78784: There's not enough left for a fox to shelter under.

78892: It's too tall to keep the rain off.
78924: You're not sure it's the best place to be, either.
78975: The trail leads south across the hillface, a level ledge worn into the
soil. Just south of you a large chunk has been washed away. A small crack is
visible by the middle of the gap, about even with the ledge.

81189: The sandbags are lying in the torrent, but the path is too wide here;
the water pours around them.
81277: The sandbag is lying in the torrent, but the path is too wide here; the
water pours around it.
81355: You stretch a foot towards the gap, then stop as the stars of the Sea
glitter beyond it. [BUG].
81453: The gap is too wide to jump, and you'll never get a foothold in that
crack.
81517: You heft your burden, considering the balance.
81600: You stretch a foot towards the bush, shift your weight, and take two
quick steps. The bush trembles but holds.
81698: You realize that you'll never make it across. The blade only sticks out
a few inches from the hillside
81864: The shaft will never hold your weight.
81893: You flatten your body against the hillside, and stretch a foot towards
the spade blade, off-center though you'll be. One quick step; you manage to
fall forward onto the trail rather than sideways.
82095: The tree screams "I'm down, I'm down, don't hit me again!" [BUG]
82182: It is echoed by a splintering concussion right above your head, or, from
the feel of it, just inside.

You watch the tree topple through blobs of dull
color.
82336: Hmsomewhere outside.
82476: You pick yourself up shakily, although you can't quite remember falling.
The air is full of smoke.
82560: You are in a dense tangle of bushes and small trees. The ground falls
away to the southeast, to the meadows below; you can see a lake far to the
west.
82677: You are in a dense tangle of bushes, small trees, and shadow. The ground
falls away to the southeast, to the green meadows below; you can see a lake far
to the west.
82806: You are in a dense tangle of shadow, bushes, and small trees. The ground
falls away to the southeast, to the darkening meadows below.
82911: You are in a dense tangle of shadow, bushes, and small trees. The ground
falls away to the southeast, to the misty meadows below.
83014: You are in a dense tangle of shadow, bushes, and small trees. The ground
falls away to the southeast, into darkness and rain.
83103: A trail curves down to the southwest. Another cuts along the hill to the
north, but a chunk is washed out, too wide to jump across.
83214: You have barely left sight of the shed when the trail ends. It looks
like it was washed out; and the scree that covers the hill face is much too
unstable to venture across. You have no choice but to return.
83395: The door to the shed is closed. You tug on it and rattle the latch, but
it's locked
83496: You step hesitantly into the darkness.
83530: An old shed stands just to the east.
83559: It's weathered but sturdy, still wearing the tatters of a coat of white
paint.
83621: The door is open to the unrelieved darkness within.
83661: The door is closed.
83678: The shed is weathered but sturdy, still wearing the tatters of a coat of
white paint.
83744: The door is open to the unrelieved darkness within.
83789: The door is closed. The lock looks badly rusted.
83829: The door is closed. The lock looks rusty.
83867: It may be weathered, but it's not weakened. You can't even shake it.
83928: The door is closed.
83943: It's dark in there, and you can't see a thing.
83995: The lock is rusted tight. You can barely get the key in, and it has no
faint hope of turning.
84081: The lock is stiff. You give the key a jerk; the latch scrapes, and the
door swings open.
84154: You push the door shut, and the latch snaps to.
84194: A daemon pops out of the lock. "Hey! How'd you close this without
locking it?" He snaps the latch closed and vanishes. [BUG]
84296: A daemon pops out of the lock. "Hey! How'd you unlock this without
opening it?" He yanks the door open and vanishes. [BUG]
84403: You feel the hollow darkness of an enclosed space. To the west, an
oblong of flat grey half-light betrays the doorway. Nothing else is visible.
84560: The shed is only a few paces long, and nearly empty. The door is to the
west.
84623: The only exit you can make out is to the west.
84656: The only exit is to the west.
84690: The door latches from the outside. Closing it would be less than clever.
84768: A pair of large canvas bags lie at a narrow point on the path. One is
rather dirty; the other has a tear along one seam, from which sand dribbles
onto the ground.
84885: A pair of large canvas bags is piled untidily here. One is rather dirty;
the other has a tear along one seam, from which sand dribbles onto the ground.
85045: A dirty sandbag is lying on the ground.
85078: It's a canvas bag, more than two feet long. The surface is liberally
smeared with mud.
85150: Water is backed up behind it.
85188: After all you've done to get it there?
85224: One of these things, you can barely carry. Two, never.
85298: acrfpn. Releasing it in a surge would probably be a mistake.
85346: It's sewn shut.
85364: You give the canvas a vicious yank, but it doesn't give way.
85451: You heave the dirty sandbag, awkwardly, up into your arms.
85509: You drop the dirty sandbag, but the path is too wide here; the water
pours around it.
85639: A torn sandbag is lying on the ground.
85670: It's a canvas bag, more than two feet long. A palm-length tear along a
seam leaks sand.
85744: Water is backed up behind it.
85780: After all you've done to get it there?
85814: One of these things, you can barely carry. Two, never.
85888: acrfpn. Releasing it in a surge would probably be a mistake.
85936: It's sewn shut.
85959: After all you've done to get it there?
85988: You give the canvas a vicious yank. It tears more easily than you
thought, and you're left staring at a canvas rag and a pile of sand that's gone
86163: You heave the torn sandbag, awkwardly, up into your arms. You manage to
do it without straining the torn cloth further.
86263: You drop the torn sandbag, but the path is too wide here; the water
pours around it.
86324: You lower the torn sandbag to the ground, trying not to strain it.
86486: A canvas rag, the remnant of the torn sandbag, is lying here.
86544: It's not fixable. Not by you, anyway.
86580: The torn sandbag will never hold anything again.
86620: Tearing it further wouldn't help matters.
86779: A pathetic pile of sand is slowly washing away in the rain.
86866: You scoop up a handful of sand.
86926: The last of the sand has washed away.
86969: The handful of sand is immediately lost in the stony ground.
87073: Waiting on the shore; sand yields beneath my feet
The water shouts and
roars and rushes
And breaks on the rocks, and
Never comes near to where I wait.
87202: upm

The picnic is going full blast, which is exactly why you've
wandered away from it. It's not that you don't like your new companions; it's
just that after weeks of spending each day around them, a noisy weekend
cook-out isn't the way to relax. Some exploration -- on your own -- is an
appealing thought.

None of them noticed you drifting away, anyhow.
87669: This one night will not end, not under this sky
Of stars and embers and
hot tea and song
And stories remembered not a moment too long
And laughter,
darkness, fire, the circle, and I.

88809: You let out a long whistle.
88837: The fox's ears poke up, and then it cocks its head reproachfully.
88905: acrfxn at nothingness. It hits, tearing open the space-time continuum.
Hideous elder things look out, scowl at you, and zip the hole shut again. [BUG]
89203: You won't get far without something to dig with.
89238: You can't dig in that.
89263: Things could have turned out better.
89296: You have a good time after all.
89323: You have become God. [BUG] -- pity, though.
89379: That isn't pourable.
89406: There's hardly room.
89505: Stone hangs around you, unyielding grey veils in a dim grey light. The
light comes from far away:
89905: Stone dissolves around you as move up and forwards, into a grainy grey
light. A mindless roar stretches in all directions; but it is troubled by a
distant murmur. The new sound swells, whispering, pounding, then shouting at
you, and you cannot make it out and you cannot make it go --
90124: upm
You awaken in the cave, sore and cold, bathed in the listless light
of an overcast dawn. By the time you wade across the swollen stream, you're as
soaked and miserable as if you'd slept out in the rain after all. You reach
civilization exhausted and with what promises to be a lovely cough.

90780: As good-looking as ever.
90798: You glance outside.
91116: You can't see anything particularly interesting in that direction.
91164: The shouts of the volleyball players and the boom-box thump are
pleasantly far off to the west.
91232: You hear yells, laughter, music. People are having a good time. You just
want to get away.
91300: Trails snake up the side of the hill, to the summit, an angle of sunlit
stone against the unbounded blue.
91376: You hear yells, laughter, music. People are having a good time.

climb.
91476: Two trails lead up from here; you can go northeast or south.
91520: The underbrush is too dense in that direction.
91556: A trail leads southwest down the hill, towards the bridge. From where

hillside. A narrower trail leads more steeply up to the east.

91836: The hillside drops straight down in that direction.
91872: The underbrush is too dense in that direction.
91904: The wide trail leads down to the southwest, and up across the hill to
the southeast. The upward half seems deeply cut into the hillside; it's as if
something had worn the rocky earth away.
92036: The narrow trail leads straight up the hillside to the east.
92080: The trench is a foot deep or so, and maybe a yard wide. It starts where
the wide trail turns, and leads west over the bank.
92168: It's the blade of a small spade. There's nothing left of the shaft.
92220: At this point, it's just a two-foot-long stick, broken at both ends.
92276: The ground drops off, dangerously steeply, in that direction.
92320: The ground drops off, dangerously steeply, in that direction.

92708: The hill is too steep in that direction.
92736: Beyond the rise, the hill drops almost straight down to the stream.
92784: Beyond the rise, the hill drops almost straight down to the stream.
92832: The underbrush is too dense in that direction.
92864: It's just a stony ridge; the ground slopes up a few feet before dropping
off to the stream.
92976: It's water. It's in the bucket.

hill to the south, but a chunk is washed out, too wide to jump across.

93404: The hill is too steep and overgrown to climb.
93436: Jumping off the bluff wouldn't work well. Perhaps the trail to the
southwest.
93492: No trails go up the hill from here, and the undergrowth is too heavy to
push through.
93552: The undergrowth is too dense in that direction.
93588: It's a forlorn, sodden scrap of canvas.
