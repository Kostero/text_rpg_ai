20685: Time passes.
20700: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
33835: Thank you.
42155: You lean over the edge and try to peer under the bed, but the blood
rushes to your head and your eyes refuse to focus.
42243: You find your Ruby Poo underoos.
42277: You don't find anything else.
42507: That, or it has something to do with never changing your underwear.
42986: But, if you want to chance it anyways, then on your head lies the blame.
43110: No way, go put some underwear on.
43154: It's stuck to the broom.
43346: down. A warm glow comes from the toaster.
43416: They are asleep. Apparently they have built a nest in your toaster.
43532: Heheheh.
43550: Why bother?
43598: It has already been pushed!
43628: Gently, so as not to wake the fearsome socks, you push down the lever.
43691: You push down the lever.
43860: Toast anyone?
43897: The lever pops up with a cheery snap.
43959: Toast anyone?
43990: The socks leap from the toaster in a flash, fastening themselves onto
your body with their terrible elastic mouths. You struggle mightily in their
grip, but to no avail. Gradually, the venom from their bite drags you down into
oblivion.
44233: No thanks.
44258: The shoes hop out of the fridge.
44331: A frantic pounding comes from within the fridge.
44370: The pounding grows weaker.
44396: The pounding stops.
44435: Lacking anything remotely resembling common sense, you down the
glowstick in one gulp.  A tingling, crawling sensation flutters across your
skin as the room begins to shrink.  Looking down at your hands, you see them
twist into hideous claws as fur sprouts from your body. Bursting through the
roof of your house, you find that you now stand fifty feet tall, a hairy
monstrosity vaguely resembling a werewolf.  You feel a tickling feeling in your
throat and cough.  Flame shoots out of your mouth, destroying a nearby home in
the process.  People point and shout as a terrible anger takes hold of you, and
you begin to crush and burn the city to the ground.
     Abruptly, you notice a
tiny figure looking up at you in horror, and your mind registers the name
'Cindy.'  You reach down and pick her up screaming.  An idea trickles through
your chemically deranged brain, and you head for the convenience store where
you bought the first glowstick.
     Eight weeks later, after having destroyed
twelve major cities, thirty-two suburbs, and New Jersey, the two of you build a
nest out of scrap metal left over from the army vehicles you've destroyed and
settle down to raise a family.  The rest of the world, having tried every
weapon known to man and giving you no more than slight indigestion from the
atomic bombs, realizes that fifty-foot-tall, egg-laying, fire-breathing
werewolves are just something they're going to have to learn to live with.
45491: yhm
As you walk out onto the floor, you step on a sharp, rusty nail. 
You try to scream, but your jaw has already frozen up, and you quickly succumb
to tetanus.
45617: The shoes protect your feet from the various sharp, rusty items.
45690: You hear a faint knock at the front door, followed by the sounds of it
opening, and a scream!
     "Hang on, Cindy! I'm coming!" you shout.
45814: These items look to be a breeding ground for tetanus. You always meant
to sweep up down here, but now *sniff* it's too late.
45918: A moment of silence for your dearly departed broom, please.
45974: You can't seem to catch it.
46014: The moth, seeing the delicious looking shirt and pants, makes a beeline
for the living clothes.  The clothes make a break for the door, but the moth is
upon them before they can get away.  It darts inside the shirt.  The clothes go
wild and start beating at themselves, but the moth is apparently eating
whatever makes them move, for they slow down and crumple to the ground.  A
rather fat moth flies out, and weaves its way outside, with a final dip in its
flight as though to say, "Thanks for dinner, buddy!"  You resolve to throw away
all your mothballs.
     "W-What was that?" stammers Cindy.
     "I'll tell you
on the way to dinner.  Right now, let me finish getting dressed.  It's been a
long day."
46574: The moth flutters into the jar.
46688: The moth flutters around in the jar.
46726: Moths can't talk.
46745: Moths can't talk.
46767: The moth seems suitably impressed.
46798: You miss.
46954: You and Cindy walk out to the car, and drive to a nice little Italian
bistro.  You explain the whole sordid affair to her over garlic bread and wine,
while waiting for your meal.  You pause periodically to allow her to gasp in
fear as you tackle the nine-foot killer Underoos, the ravenous mutant shoes,
the horrible socks, and after embellishing only somewhat, you arrive at the
point where you rescued her.  She leans forward, gazing into your eyes.
    
"My hero." she murmurs, and kisses you gently on the lips.
     Abruptly, a
wolf whistle, followed by a crude "Hot Momma!" pipes from between your legs.
  
  "That better be my underoos." you think to yourself, heading for the
bathroom....
47469: The shoes bolt out into your bedroom.
47509: The shoes hop into the kitchen.
47550: The shoes flee into the fridge.
47581: The shoes hop around in circles.
47614: The shoes huddle back into the rear of the fridge.
47658: They hop playfully out of reach.
47704: They just stink is all.
47730: The shoes don't respond.
47824: Isn't that cute?
47846: The shoes seem suitably impressed.
47919: They snarl menacingly, and you decide not to risk your hand in the
attempt.
48109: You look accusingly at your underoos, but they only belch up a
Rubbermade sticker.
48350: Finally, you begin spinning the broom handle over your head, and change
its momentum into a tremendous blow that hurls the underoos across the room to
lie still by your bed.
48482: You have nothing appropriate to attack with.
48522: The underoos don't respond.
48549: The underoos just growl at you.
48581: The underoos just growl at you.
48664: Wheoweo! Wanh WANH Wanh!
48798: Where are your socks?
48822: The suit doesn't respond.
48847: The suit doesn't say much.
48941: The suit ignores you.
48962: This is Cindy, your girlfriend.
48998: She is currently being held captive by your shirt and pants.
49056: Cindy is here, looking grateful.
49102: Much as you long to press your lips against her full red counterparts,
getting that close right now might incite the shirt to kill her.
49242: She seems happy to see you.
49324: My hero." she murmurs in your ear.
49358: Inflamed with desire, you crush her against yourself, and the two of you
raise the temperature in the room with your passion. Gasping, she pulls out of
the kiss and looks you in the eye. "We don't really HAVE to go out tonight, do
we?"
     Picking her up and carrying her towards the bedroom is all the answer
she needs.  A pity that all your efforts getting dressed are going to be wasted
though.
49654: She seems distracted.
49675: Cindy has never been much for words.
49709: She seems distracted.
49730: No way, she's your girlfriend!
49764: osnctrd,

Yesterday, as you were walking through Central Park, a
meteorite crashed nearby, bathing you in cosmic radiation.  It only made the
twelth page of the paper, under Dear Abby.  Of course, if anyone could have
foreseen the awful effects of that accident, it surely would have been a front
page story.  But there was no way for you, or anyone else, to predict that the
result of that accident would be....
50068: You walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking sock.
50489: You can't spray that!
50900: Dirty Mutant.
50917: Shoeless Kong.
50934: Gamera Wearing Matching Socks.

53820: Score:
53828: Moves:
53836: Time:
53844: You can't go that way.
54096: To the east is a hallway, that, as you even more fuzzily recall, leads
to the kitchen.
54160: This is your bed.
54320: Naaah.
54328: It's just a closet door.
54348: Assorted, but unimportant.
54412: This particular ki' chun has a toaster, a fridge, a hallway leading
west, a dark passageway leading down into the cellar, and a hallway leading
north to the entryway of your home.
54540: There is a broom leaning against the counter.
54582: There is a rubbermade sticker on the end of it, near the bristles.
54778: I wouldn't wake those socks up if I were you....
54994: Probably toxic as can be, too.
55284: The moth flutters around your glowstick, seeming to like it quite a bit.
55336: A moth flutters around.
55458: The front door leads north. The kitchen lies south.
55544: The exit lies back to the east.
55616: Worse yet, they stink something fierce.
55648: Your shoes are here, hopping about and smelling terribly.
55688: Your relationship with your underoos may never be the same, but at least
you can wear them again.
56106: Watch out world!
56120: Ordinary old socks, now that you've vanquished them.
56170: They must've suffocated in the fridge. Oh well, they're wearable once
more, at any rate!
56236: Your shirt and pants are here, holding Cindy hostage with a knife.
56284: Your shirt and pants are here, holding Cindy hostage with a knife.
56344: Damn, when did clothes figure out the difference between a butter knife
and a butcher knife?
56412: Your shirt, recently disarmed.
56440: Your pants, recently disarmed.
56478: You are likely to be eaten by a sock.
