13882: cnu 'dba KpmTo repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not
"frog, again".
13965: You can hardly repeat that.
14228: You can't begin with a comma.
14289: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
14379: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
15343: I didn't understand that sentence.
15451: I didn't understand that number.
15482: You can't see any such thing.
15545: You aren't holding that!
15574: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
15614: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
15693: You excepted something not included anyway!
15731: You can only do that to something animate.
15768: That's not a verb I recognize.
15798: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
15854: You can't see "
15899: I didn't understand the way that finished.
16000: Nothing to do!
16016: There are none at all available!

25302: At the moment, "it"
25372: and "me" means
26222: Don't hurt yourself trying.
26247: Digging here won't get you anywhere.
26278: Enjoying yourself?
26297: Oh, don't apologize.
26318: Not quite.
26368: Suppress your primal urges for a later time.
26406: You haven't slept in years. You let Leo do all the sleeping for for you.

be running it on a very primitive interpreter which is unable properly to
perform the test).

35906: You have visited:
35931: Objects you have handled:
35952: None.
36169: You are carrying nothing.
36211: Taken.
36222: You are always self-possessed.
36340: You already have that.
36425: That isn't available.
36466: That's hardly portable.
36489: That's fixed in place.
36513: You're carrying too many things already.
36588: Already on the floor.
36609: You haven't got that.
36651: Dropped.
36669: It is unfortunately closed.
36694: But it isn't there now.
36713: Removed.
36794: You can't put something on top of itself.
36871: You lack the dexterity.
36948: Done.
36990: You need to be holding it before you can put it into something else.
37043: That can't contain things.
37068: Alas, it is closed.
37089: You'll need to take it off first.
37205: Done.
37246: That isn't in your possession.
37269: First pick that up.
37557: That's not something you can enter.
37625: You can only get into something on the floor.
37738: But you aren't in anything at the moment.
37846: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
37945: You can't go that way.

locations (even if you've been there before).

of locations (even if you haven't been there before).

38696: But it's dark.
38768: You find nothing of interest.
38796: You can't see inside, since it is closed.
38879: That doesn't seem to be something you can unlock.
38920: It's unlocked at the moment.
38947: That doesn't seem to fit the lock.
39001: That doesn't seem to be something you can lock.
39040: It's locked at the moment.
39065: First you'll have to close it.

39564: You can't wear that!
39585: You're not holding that!
39608: You're already wearing that!
39657: That's plainly inedible.
39690: Not bad.
39705: That was a rhetorical question.
39732: This dangerous act would achieve little.
39766: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
39802: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
39839: That seems unnecessary.
39862: Keep your mind on the game.
39887: What a good idea.
39906: You smell nothing unexpected.
39933: You hear nothing unexpected.
39958: You taste nothing unexpected.
39990: Keep your hands to yourself!
40015: If you think that'll help.
40036: You feel nothing unexpected.
40061: Digging would achieve nothing here.
40092: Cutting that up would achieve little.
40123: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
40156: You would achieve nothing by this.
40185: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
40218: But there's no water here to carry.
40249: Oh, don't apologise.
40271: Real adventurers do not use such language.
40306: Quite.
40317: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
40350: There's not enough water to swim in.
40381: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
40414: You can't usefully blow that.
40441: You achieve nothing by this.
40466: No, you can't set that.
40489: No, you can't set that to anything.
40520: You wave, feeling foolish.
40550: But you aren't holding that.
40614: It is fixed in place.
40635: You are unable to.
40654: That would be less than courteous.
40679: Nothing obvious happens.
40707: Is that the best you can think of?
40736: That's not a direction.
40755: Not that way you can't.
40783: Keep your hands to yourself.
40804: You achieve nothing by this.
40834: Futile.
40841: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
40889: You talk to yourself a while.
40912: This provokes no reaction.
40939: There is no reply.
40958: Nothing is on sale.
40977: Your singing is abominable.
41003: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
41040: Time passes.
41055: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
41774: You gaze for a while. Nothing happens.
41806: Nothing happens.
41826: No hands to shake.
41841: Your attempt at friendliness is ignored.
41874: This is a ludicrous game. It is impossible to make mistakes that will
prevent you from winning. Common sense should be avoided whenever possible.

My
apologies (somewhat) to Graham Nelson, Andrew Plotkin, and anyone who loves
disco music. (Play to find out why.)

Special thanks to Admiral Jota and Bernd
Schmidt for beta testing. Also thanks to Dave Gatewood and Mark Tilford for
finding post-beta bugs, and all the people who pointed out the idiotic bug in
release 2 that kept the player from winning.

Help is available through the
HINT command, but if you want to avoid temptation type HINTS OFF. The hints
cannot be turned on again if you turn them off.
42354: That isn't something you can jump off.
42386: Your senses are assaulted by a vision...
42422: You are in a misty little haze of massages, all alike.
42468: The vision passes.
42486: That isn't something you need to burn.
42545: The cannon is supposed to be fired by lighting up the fuse.
42594: That's not something you can fire.
42651: You push the trigger (colored green), and a large part of the cart
catches on fire. The cart decides to not go through the the "burning away
slowly" bit and skips right to disappearing in a puff of smoke. The
flamethrower (slightly charred) falls to the ground. It plays a charming tune
indicating it has annihilated a target.
43004: You amuse yourself by briefly firing the flamethrower in a random
direction.
43091: That's not something you can start fires with. Not all by itself, at
least.
43153: That's not something you can start fires with.
43230: That isn't going to be too productive.
43262: That isn't going to be too productive.
43294: Leo's the one talented at throwing his voice.
43330: I don't understand what you mean.
43358: Leo's the one talented at throwing his voice.
43399: This is the wrong game for that sort of thing.
43432: There's no point in licking that.
43458: That won't play.
43474: That isn't going to work.
43502: That would be somewhat rude.
43554: The proper way of talking to someone is like this: "Leo, Hello."
43882: The hints have been turned off.
43925: The hints are now off.
43950: That's not the proper tool for the job.
43979: That wouldn't be too useful.
44018: Your last attempt resulted in having five stitches. Don't push your
luck.
44118: The crayon is fixed into place.
44256: clicks neatly into place. A deep throbbing resonates as a secret
compartment opens in the wall.
44362: This game will admittedly let you sink to some pretty low moral values.
This is not one of them.
44448: Leo needs to be awake for you to do that.
44489: "I'm not very good at talking about myself."
44531: "You're my partner in crime, what else can I say?"
44577: "He was a good brother. He died when he got pushed off a cliff by some
film people trying to make a film about lemmings jumping off cliffs. Horrible."
Leo shudders at the memory.
44711: "Very nice. Useful for making bread products."
44755: "He seems to be a fine chap to me. Probably had too much sugar in his
cereal one day and snapped."
44837: "It's a chest, it's high up, and we can't reach it. Have I covered
everything?"
44909: "Disco music is the basic building block of all matter. Scientists just
haven't looked deep enough yet."
44993: "Very cozy. Certainly better than that hotel we stayed at on our last
trip. It had ants the size of gorillas." Leo is exaggerating, of course, but
only slightly.
45116: "Speaking in tongues, maybe?"
45150: "Lemmings? What? Where? Who are you talking about?"
45199: "I like rubble. It invigorates me."
45235: "I never liked moose. I used to have nightmares of them chasing me."
45297: "Great place. This town should advertise it more. There could be an
entire theme park based around it."
45383: "Can't help you there, sorry."
45413: "I can't think of anything meaningful to say about that."
45461: "Nothing witty comes to mind about that, sorry."
45513: Leo needs to be awake for you to do that.
45558: "Hello. I'd ask about the weather or something, but I hardly pay
attention to that sort of thing."
45631: "Can't help you there, sorry."
45673: Leo needs to be awake for you to do that.
45715: "That isn't in my job description."
45749: "Sorry, I have this bad back, you see."
45786: "I think that's in your department."
45862: Leo wakes suddenly, barely missing your face with his paw. "What's the
big idea, huh? Trying to make some sort of sentimental movie?"
45959: Leo avoids you, watching suspiciously.
45993: This game will admittedly let you sink to some pretty low moral values.
This is not one of them.
46076: You prod Leo for awhile, and he responds by turning his body a little.
46146: Leo needs to be awake for you to do that.
46184: "It wasn't that kind of question."
46227: Leo needs to be awake for you to do that.
46265: "I don't quite follow what you're getting at there."
46313: "I don't need to mess with that anymore."
46359: Leo pauses for a moment, then his eyes light up. He pops out of your
pocket and disappears between the rows.
46450: Leo needs to be awake for you to do that.
46481: Leo looks just a bit confused.
46518: Leo needs to be awake for you to do that.
46549: Leo briefly sings part of an aria from a Mozart opera. "Sorry, that's
all the words I know." Leo knows many songs, but only the first few phrases of
each.
46742: You feel something twisting in your pocket as Leo "the Lemming" pokes
his head out of your pocket and sniffs around. "So, what trouble have you got
us into now?" Leo is using his British accent at the moment.
47085: Leo squeals with delight. "Look, disco!" He leaps onto the dance floor
and starts spinning around.

The scene of a furry animal dancing on a grid of
multicolored lights is not a scene seen by many; you now understand what horror
story writers mean by "forbidden knowledge."

Your thoughts are diverted by
three sounds, in quick succession: "plop", "aaah!", and "dong!". It seems that
one of the dancers has sent Leo airborne.
47512: Leo walks crookedly back and forth a bit more before plummeting off the
end of the world.

"AAAaaaaahhh....!"
47660: Leo lands upside down in your pocket, then rights himself. "That was
great! I haven't ridden a roller coaster like that in years!"
47815: "Fools! You invoke the great curse of Nuag'gatoa!"
47859: All heads turn to the booming voice coming from the giant moose head.
47917: "One of you has dared to attempt to destroy me, the mighty moose god of
ages, but I am here, and ready for vengeance!"
48009: With that last word a stampede suddenly sends you sprawling against the
wall as the members of the Secret Society of the Moose run for their
lives.

Leo rolls on the floor laughing uncontrollably, noticeably battered
from being steamrollered by a crowd of moose fanatics. "Well," he says,
"painful but great fun," immediately before jumping into your pocket and
falling asleep instantly.
48297: Leo says, "That's it? I excepted something more impressive, with
fireworks and loud music or something."
48400: Leo peers at the flamethrower, saying, "I used to have one of those when
I was a kid. My brother and I would make cinnamon toast with it."
48629: The first meeting of Onion Lovers Anonymous will begin at midnight."
48685: I haven't seen giblets like that in years."
48723: Why, when I was your age we had to walk twenty miles in the snow for one
stalk of celery!"
48792: One milkshake, hold the cup."
48820: I knew he was trouble. People wearing bells on their hats always were."
49026: You first met Leo "the Lemming" hitchhiking near Interstate 10. He has
been a semiconstant companion ever since, being on the whole an agreeable sort
of lemming.
49152: Presently, Leo is dozing away in your pocket.
49297: Very-Great-Grampa Darby must be rolling in his grave.
49342: Aye, this brings back memories. Dates back all the way to the winter of
1829 when Very-Great-Grampa Darby was hunting moose. It's been passed down from
generation to generation ever since, hardly washed, and now has the general
appearance of something a private eye might wear after being roughed up by a
few IRS agents. Especially useful is the pocket that looks like it could hold
enough to feed an entire army. (The edible parts, that is, although Leo has
developed a theory that anything is edible as long as you swallow hard enough.)
49738: It's the sort of thing you would normally find in a park, but this tree
seems to have found itself among tasteful concrete pastels.
49836: A chest has somehow managed to lodge itself in the tree's upper
branches.
49899: The tree gives you a somber look. How a tree can look somber is left to
the imagination of the reader.
49977: The tree refuses to cooperate; none of its branches have grown into a
position convenient to climbing.
50055: You grip the tree firmly with both arms, shake vigorously, wail loudly,
and gain nothing but the respect and admiration of a crowd of spectators who
just passed by.
50174: A solid wooden chest, with the words "
50250: It's currently lodged in the upper branches of the tree in a
particularly embarrassing position.
50336: After drying your eyeballs for quite some time, you glimpse the chest
shift close to half a millimeter, but nothing else happens.
50427: The chest is too high up to do anything but gaze longingly at it.
50485: The chest is far too heavy to lift.
50528: And deface a important artifact? Shame on you.
50619: The fuse burns out with no gunpowder to light. A cannon fairy magically
appears and puts on a new fuse before disappearing in a puff of smoke.
50746: The cannon makes a loud pop but has no projectile to launch. A cannon
fairy magically appears and puts on a new fuse before disappearing in a puff of
smoke.
50891: launches at the tree, exploding in a burst of water. A cannon fairy
magically appears and puts on a new fuse before disappearing in a puff of
smoke.
51012: launches at the tree, but bounces off it and to the ground, hardly
making any impression on the tree at all. A cannon fairy magically appears and
puts on a new fuse before disappearing in a puff of smoke.
51163: After a brief dramatic pause and drumroll sounding somewhere in the
distance, the pink elephant launches directly at the tree, making an indistinct
"plong" sound before vaporizing into dust.

The chest falls to the ground and
pops open.
51340: Leo leaps at the chest with his usual squeal of delight, fainting in
mid-air when he sees the contents of the chest and bouncing off the tree with a
rather more distinct "plong" sound than the elephant made.
51487: You peer fearfully into the chest. It contains...it
contains...a...

"Yes, You Too Can Find Hidden Treasure With This Handy
Treasure Kit, Guaranteed to Work or Your Money Back."

You faint, landing on
top of Leo.
51732: Leo flees to the southwest, where in the distance you can hear the
"clang" of something hitting a metal pole.
51829: You gulp down the water balloon. A few moments later you spit out a huge
gush of water onto the ground.
51906: Stars, galaxies, and fruits of various flavors tumble through the void.
Quite romantic, really, and it seems someone else had the same idea; some
restaurant-style tables are scattered near the edge so customers can take in
the view. A sign leans heavily on a nearby pole. Roads lead off to the
northeast, east, and southeast.
52144: There's also a large hole you can enter to the south.
52223: The most horrific mind-numbing terror ever created in the history of man
is in that direction. I urge you to reconsider.
52330: Please, think carefully about the value you put on your sanity before
continuing.
52396: You win, but I am exempted from responsibility for any damage this might
cause...
52495: Paths lead in easterly directions.
52529: Paths lead in easterly directions. There's also a hole in the wall to
the south you can enter.
52596: Paths lead in easterly directions.
52649: A supernova spins by followed by a flock of cows. An astronaut lands on
a watermelon somewhere in the distance, plants some sort of flag, and is
promptly flattened by a large, juicy tomato. You sail through a hail of water
balloons, past a bunch of electric sparks that look like bad special effects,
and...
53071: Mysteriously, you sense you've gathered a new object along the way.
53135: Leo says, "Nice landing."
53177: It's too heavy.
53201: The pole shakes and rings loudly.
53243: The crayon falls off the pole to the ground.
53294: A crayon falls off the pole to the ground.
53332: Disappointingly, your tongue does not stick to the pole.
53378: It's a tall, metal pole.
53411: You notice a crayon situated on the top of the pole.
53566: Really not all that tasty looking.
53602: The lunatic plucks a few chords.
53675: The lunatic says, "Wibble."
53731: The lunatic turns away protectively.
53767: It could be the one Jimi Hendrix played at Woodstock, or it could be
your imagination.
53833: It could be the one Jimi Hendrix played at Woodstock, or it could be
your imagination. Large bananas float gaily by.
53928: It is a maroon crayon.
53945: It is a maroon crayon, one of the Magic Crayons of Destiny.
53999: You see a maroon crayon situated on top of the pole.
54036: You can see a maroon crayon here.
54092: Your aim is off, and the water balloon explodes on the ground, lightly
splashing your face.
54164: The Holy Grail isn't something you want to throw around, even if it was
made in Taiwan.
54235: That won't work too well.
54304: You can't reach it from here.
54332: Recalling your childhood years, you gulp down the crayon, only to have
it spit itself out again.
54408: Magic Crayons apparently don't like being eaten.
54456: It is a green crayon.
54473: It is a green crayon, one of the Magic Crayons of Destiny.
54527: Recalling your childhood years, you gulp down the crayon, only to have
it spit itself out again.
54603: Magic Crayons apparently don't like being eaten.
54650: The music is quite hearable as it is.
54715: Loud throbbing in the bass strains and stretches your ears.
54762: The music kicks up to a faster tempo.
54795: The music slows down a notch.
54822: A chair with very tall legs looms before you.
54858: An old man is perched on top of the chair.
54901: You're really not in a good position to do that.
54943: That's not very sporting, annihilating an unarmed man like that.
55015: Your weapon strikes true, splattering the old man's face with water. He
seemed to enjoy the experience, but immediately begins wiping his face dry.
55127: The Holy Grail isn't something you want to throw around, even if it was
made in Taiwan.
55198: That won't work too well.
55450: fxnbriefly does a "Thinker" sort of pose before relaxing again.
55502: He looks like he could be someone's grandfather, albiet a very energetic
one. Every once in a while he twiddles some device too far away for you to see.
55616: His hand is resting on a record that is just within reach.
55687: You manage to grab the record while the old man is distracted.
55732: The old man's elbow is leaning on the record, holding it down.
55784: I don't quite follow.
55810: Your fingernail doesn't play the music on the record very well.
55862: You move the needle along the record, and a few seconds of disco music
erupt and die away.
55948: The lunatic's eyes widen with fear, his hands tremble in fear, and his
body is running with fear -- straight through the wall to the south, leaving an
unusually large hole.
56072: That isn't an effective tool for playing the record.
56126: One man's market is another man's somewhat dilapidated looking corner
with the word "Market" on a sign hanging above.
56218: Other than that, the only indicator of such is a cart that probably held
items once but looks pretty barren at the moment.
56303: The pastel motif does do a bit to lighten things up, though. Roads wind
their way west and southeast.
56386: It's too high up for you to reach, even if you jumped.
56435: Jammed into the frame of the cart is an official "L'il Terrorist
Flamethrower."
56494: There is a flamethrower (slightly charred) here.
56534: Every kid's favorite toy, for ages 3 and up.
56575: The only reason it hasn't been taken already seems to be that it is
jammed solid into the frame of the cart.
56667: The flamethrower is stuck in the frame of the cart.
56712: The flamethrower works by saying something like "Fire flamethrower at
haystack."
56783: Only one is enough.
56804: Never being one to take things literally, you actually do find a needle.
56860: You find nothing of interest. Perhaps a more specific search would help.
56920: A glowing force field briefly appears around the haystack with a distant
voice saying, "This haystack protected by the Acme Anti-Arson System. Please
call 1-800-ACME-FUN for more information. Thank you."
57089: It's too heavy.
57119: The bag bursts open, revealing some giraffe food. It seems the bag was
mislabeled.
57182: Kind of tricky with the bag closed.
57221: It's too heavy.
57238: The bag is already open.
57262: The bag is ripped open. It isn't going to close.
57309: You don't find any more prizes hidden in the bag.
57359: Another search reveals prize at the bottom: the green crayon!
57409: You dig through the food but find nothing.
57450: There's too much to carry, and it really isn't needed later.
57539: Actually tastes kind of good.
57577: Another search reveals prize at the bottom: the green crayon!
57625: You dig through the food but find nothing.
57668: You are somewhat baffled by the speech, but it seems to have something
to do with the inherent connections between moose, iguanas and electric light
bulbs.
57783: The dimmed light and assorted decorations here were probably done to set
a mysterious atmosphere, but you can never tell with people wearing costumes
depicting famous moose throughout history sitting cross-legged on the ground
engrossed in a speech being given by a fierce-looking lady who occasionally
beats on the large bowl in front of her for emphasis. There is an exit to the
south.
58048: The dimmed light and assorted decorations in here were probably done to
set a mysterious atmosphere. The rest of the room is now abandoned, making the
large bowl in the front of the room even more prominent.
58330: a mauve crayon as a weapon. The crayon seems to stand out
three-dimensionally from the rest of the picture.
58435: There's a huge crowd and a speaker blocking your access.
58484: This is a really big moose head. You can't budge it.
58559: A huge moose head is hung on the wall behind the speaker.
58611: You are somewhat baffled by the speech, but it seems to have something
to do with the inherent connections between moose, iguanas and electric light
bulbs.
58724: Tempting, but not tempting enough.
58771: The speaker takes some powder out of the bowl and sets it on the ground
while taking out a lighted match. She puts the match to the powder, and it
explodes. Apparently this illustrates some point in the lecture, but you can't
fathom what.
58955: The speaker beats on the bowl for emphasis.
58993: The speaker makes what seems to be an important point about the inherent
connections between moose and electric light bulbs.
59085: The speaker makes what seems to be an important point about the inherent
connections between iguanas and electric light bulbs.
59269: That's not very sporting, annihilating an unarmed crowd like that.
59331: There's a huge crowd and a speaker blocking your access.
59385: The bowl is much larger and heavier than you are.
59431: There's a huge crowd and a speaker blocking your access.
59477: The powder streams between the gaps in your fingers. You need some sort
of container.
59550: It's only powder.
59575: The powder immediately slips through the seams at the bottom of your
pocket and vanishes.
59644: That won't work as a container.
59675: You fill the Grail with a quantity of powder.
59720: The powder immediately slips through the seams at the bottom of your
pocket and vanishes in the air.
59796: You pour the powder back into the large bowl.
59833: That won't hold the powder too well.
59863: You put the powder into the cannon.
59900: It is a mauve crayon.
59917: It is a mauve crayon, one of the Magic Crayons of Destiny.
59979: Recalling your childhood years, you gulp down the crayon, only to have
it spit itself out again.
60055: Magic Crayons apparently don't like being eaten.
60122: You notice a black crayon under the rubble.
60162: The light bulb is too high to reach.
60197: It's a lot bigger than you are.
60279: A secret compartment opens in the wall.
60310: A bulky rock with writing scrawled on it is near one of the walls.
60370: On second glance, it isn't blood but merely red crayon. It reads:
"Insert the Magic Crayons of Destiny into the depressions to open the vault."
60492: You notice a black crayon under the rubble that you hadn't seen before.
60560: That won't fit.
60585: Depressing.
60596: Depressing. It contains
60634: It is a black crayon.
60651: It is a black crayon, one of the Magic Crayons of Destiny.
60703: Recalling your childhood years, you gulp down the crayon, only to have
it spit itself out again.
60777: Magic Crayons apparently don't like being eaten.
60825: A secret compartment is open.
60905: The compartment is part of the wall.
60941: It's a compartment in the wall.
61030: You don't need to use the Grail for that.
61076: There's nothing in the Grail.
61103: You pour the powder out of the Grail, and it slowly vanishes into the
air.
61178: The Grail is already full with powder.
61234: There's nothing you can fill from here.
61283: The grail is empty.
61306: Powder is a solid, not a liquid.
61331: You don't need to do that, since you plan to live forever anyway.
61386: Death. Decay. Stench. Bubblegum.
61418: A skeleton is leaning against the wall here.
61461: Have some respect for the dead.
61491: Poor fellow. He has a package cradled lovingly in its arms.
61534: The skeleton actually looks quite peaceful, now that it has been
relieved of its package.
61598: A package is cradled in the skeleton's arms.
61639: It's a brown package, cradled in the skeleton's arms.
61680: It's a brown package. There is a label on it marked "To: Balances."
Looks like the delivery boy got sent to the wrong address.
61794: You open the package and the wrapping disappears in a puff of smoke. You
now have the pink cuddly toy elephant that was inside.
62784: You can't go that way.
62860: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
62892: As good-looking as ever.
62936: How do I get at the chest?
62956: Take a look at the other things of interest near the chest.
63000: The cannon seems to be pointed directly at the tree.
63036: This is the puzzle that lasts the entire game.
63068: Look at the cannon question for more information.
63104: What do I do with the cannon?
63128: EXAMINE THE CANNON.
63152: You need all the pieces mentioned: a projectile, gunpowder, and
something to light the fuse with.
63220: This is the puzzle that lasts the entire game, so if there are still
puzzles you haven't solved you should go back and do them now.
63312: The flamethrower in the Market can be used to light the fuse.
63356: The bowl in the Moose Headquarters contains gunpowder; you will need the
Holy Grail to carry some to the cannon.
63440: The pink elephant in the package the skeleton is holding is the
projectile.
63492: What should I do at the End of the World?
63524: Read the sign.
63536: This is not a game where you want to be cautious.
63572: JUMP OFF THE END OF THE WORLD.
63608: How do I get the maroon crayon?
63632: Use your intuition here.
63652: What have you seen the pole do before?
63680: It shook when Leo hit it.
63700: SHAKE THE POLE.
63720: Is the lunatic useful for anything?
63748: Yes.
63752: The lunatic seems to like certain types of music.
63788: But possibly not others.
63808: Don't go on reading hints until you have the record.
63848: You need to play the record for the lunatic. What are records played
with?
63952: Needle. What have you seen that could hide needles?
63992: The haystack looks promising.
64016: FIND THE NEEDLE IN THE HAYSTACK.
64056: Then, PLAY RECORD WITH NEEDLE while at the lunatic.
64108: How do I get the record?
64128: You need to distract the old man with something.
64164: Something not too violent, but forceful.
64196: Something found near the End of the World. See the corresponding
question if you need help with this.
64268: THROW WATER BALLOON AT MAN. Then, TAKE RECORD.
64324: Where do I find the Magic Crayons of Destiny?
64360: There's no subtle way of saying these, so these are all direct answers.
64412: Black crayon: You should see it after you examine the writing.
64456: Maroon crayon: SHAKE THE POLE at the End of the World.
64504: Green crayon: After doing OPEN BAG at the Market, SEARCH BAG twice.
64564: Mauve crayon: EXAMINE THE PICTURE at the Moose Headquarters, then TAKE
CRAYON.
64640: How do I get rid of the crowd listening to the speaker?
64680: You need to drive the crowd away somehow.
64836: You need to somehow scare them with the huge moose head.
64876: You can't reach the head from where you are.
64908: Leo can, in a manner of speaking.
64932: You need to use one of Leo's talents.
64960: There are many ways to phrase this; LEO, THROW YOUR VOICE AT THE MOOSE
HEAD will work.
65044: What am I supposed to do at the Moose Headquarters?
65084: Also, one decoration in particular seems interesting.
65124: Examine the picture closely. Does anything seem unusual about it?
(Besides it being unusual in general, of course.)
65208: TAKE THE MAUVE CRAYON.
65236: To do anything else you need to make the crowd and the speaker leave
(see next question).
65300: Check out the bowl near the front, and the decorations.
65340: You need the powder from the bowl. There is a container elsewhere.
65388: The container is at the Ancient Mayan Ruins.
65424: The Holy Grail. Fill it with powder.
65452: How do I get the flamethrower out of the cart?
65488: Flamethrowers are useful for starting fires.
65520: Which can in turn burn something down.
65548: The cart, for instance.
65568: SHOOT FLAMETHROWER AT CART or just SHOOT FLAMETHROWER.
65632: What can I do with the haystack?
65656: EXAMINE THE HAYSTACK.
65684: Take what you read literally.
65708: FIND A NEEDLE IN THE HAYSTACK.
65754: There is information provided on the following:

     How do I get at
the chest? 
     What do I do with the cannon? 
     What should I do at the
End of the World? 
     How do I get the maroon crayon? 
     Is the lunatic
useful for anything? 
     How do I get the record? 
     Where do I find the
Magic Crayons of Destiny? 
     What am I supposed to do at the Moose
Headquarters? 
     How do I get rid of the crowd listening to the speaker? 
  
  How do I get the flamethrower out of the cart? 
     What can I do with the
haystack?
66226: next to the words "Treasure located here!"
66260: Tasteful pastels and neons form a concrete square around an anomalous
growth in the form of a large tree. The odd walls and spires surrounding give
the impression of exits in many directions.
66392: After proceeding a short while, you are stopped at a road block that
reads: "Closed for Construction, Use South Route."
66480: After proceeding a short while, you are stopped at a road block that
reads: "Closed for Construction, Use East Route."
66568: A chest has somehow managed to lodge itself in the tree's upper
branches.
66620: A cannon sits nearby.
66636: One of those old-style cannons, aimed directly at the tree; it has
apparently been made after hours of painstaking research. For those unfamiliar
with late 4th century Zilodaxian technology: a projectile and gunpowder go in
the cannon, and the fuse is lit.
66816: It's a green water balloon.
66836: That's the edge. You can jump off it if you feel reckless today.
66888: All the tables are the same style, circular with four legs and a smooth
finish.
66944: It ends abruptly, as most edges are apt to do.
66980: "The End of the World Grill - Closed." Also underneath, in bold print:
"No jumping off the edge! It may be hazardous to your health."
67084: The lunatic shows the classic symptoms: wild eyes, foamy mouth, and a
tendency to say "wibble" every once in a while. The guitar under the arm
doesn't seem standard, but hey, whatever works.
67220: A raised floor with an undulating and twisting crowd makes the whole
scene defy further description.
67288: You can only go out the way you came in.
67316: It's a chair with very tall legs. How grandpa got up there is one of
those mysteries shelved next to the aerosol deodorant.
67404: Looks like a disco record.
67424: It's a hole in the south wall.
67448: The exits are west and southeast.
67472: "Market." Very profound stuff. You mark a note to do a literary analysis
sometime.
67532: Haystacks are stacks composed of primarily hay. People also find needles
in them (metaphorically, or course.)
67612: It is a bag of Uncle Joe's World-Class Llama Feed, Guaranteed to Make
Your Llama Grow Faster. Also Included in Every Bag Absolutely Free is a Green
Crayon. The bag is closed.
67748: It has "Each item $1" scrawled on the front. This has been crossed off
and replaced with "Each item 50 cents" followed by "Each item 25 cents" and
finally "Everything free." This last one seems to have brought the customers,
because the cart looks pretty barren.
67944: It is a bag of Uncle Joe's World-Class Llama Feed, Guaranteed to Make
Your Llama Grow Faster. Also Included in Every Bag Absolutely Free is a Green
Crayon. The bag is open, revealing some giraffe food.
68104: Loads of giraffe food.
68120: Paths lead east and west, and doors are to the north and south.
68164: You've come across a relatively normal-looking section of town; the
pastel motif and been traded in favor of dull browns and yellows. A building to
the north has a sign and a door. A building to the south has a sign and a place
that used to have a door. Paths to the east and west have neither signs nor
doors.
68380: "Come see the authentic Mayan ruins! Satisfaction guaranteed!" Between
the words "the" and "authentic" you can see in fine print "slightly."
68484: "Official Headquarters of the Secret Society of the Moose."
68532: The only exit is south.
68552: Pictures, certificates, and other objects of mysterious import. One
picture in particular stands particularly prominent.
68636: Fierce, embalmed, and very dead.
68660: Black hair, tanned body, outrageous outfit, and eyes with a color so odd
they can't really be described.
68740: The people are paying painfully close attention to the lady who is
speaking. They are also paying equal attention to the huge moose head on the
wall, as if they are expecting that to start giving a speech, too.
68884: Nicely carved out of marble, containing some sort of powder.
68928: It's a dark, mysterious powder.
68952: It's a dark, mysterious powder.
68976: The only exit is north.
68996: This place does have an antique flavor to it, although you never knew
the Mayans made statues made entirely of old tires. The electric light also
seems to detract somewhat from the atmosphere. Still, if you like piles of
rubble this tourist spot is quite a photo opportunity. The only exit is north.
69204: It's rubble. Not too exciting, is it?
69236: A regular light bulb, currently on, and too high up to reach.
69280: Big and rocklike. Also of note is the writing and the four depressions
nearby.
69336: The Holy Grail is supposed to grant anyone who drinks from it
immortality, or at least that's what the movies say. You notice a "Made in
Taiwan" stamp on the bottom.
69456: Odor permeates this place, which seems to be the inside of a large wall.
Shadows are positioned to look like they are ready to jump at you. The only
exit is north.
69572: The only exit is north.
69616: says it all, really. Strange that it got sent here. Must be all the
pastel motifs.
