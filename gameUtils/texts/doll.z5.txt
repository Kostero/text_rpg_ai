54672: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
54758: When you saw the ugly little doll in the shop window you knew you had to
have it. It would make a great addition to your collection of mysterious items
and artifacts.

The doll stood only about a foot tall and seemed to be made of
a tough leathery material. Its head was small and misshapen, and its long,
razor-sharp teeth could be seen protruding from its mouth. It wore a little
gold talisman around its neck and wielded a cute little six inch sword. The
sign read "Genuine African Zuni Doll. Only $19.99"

After bringing it home and
taking it out of the box you read the little information sheet that came with
it.
55208: "African Zuni Doll"
55224: "It is said that the Zuni Doll is inhabited by the spirit of an African
Tribesman who died while committing a cowardly act. In order to let the
deceased regain his lost honor, the tribe's witch doctor imprisoned the man's
spirit in a doll and a talisman that he created especially for that purpose.
The spirit remains trapped until it atones for the cowardice the tribesman
committed and proves its bravery. To accomplish this, the Zuni Doll must
complete a near impossible task: hunt and kill, 25 human.

"Fortunately, the
Zuni Doll is harmless as long as it continues to wear the gold talisman. The
magic in the talisman keeps the Zuni Doll from coming to life and carrying out
its mission of blood."

Now, you are lying in bed thinking of the little doll
when you feel a slight pressure near your feet. Looking down you see your cat,
Elmo, crawling towards you. You reach down and give Elmo a good scratch behind
the ears. That is when you notice something small and golden drop from his
mouth.
55960: That doesn't make a very good range weapon.
55992: I don't think you can spray that at anything.
56024: You can't lock the door while it's open.
56612: , and DOWN to D. IN and OUT will also work in certain places.

There are
many different kinds of sentences used in "The Zuni Doll". Here are some
examples:
>WALK TO THE NORTH
>WEST
>NE
>DOWN
>TAKE THE BIRDCAGE
>OPEN THE
PANEL
>LIE DOWN IN THE PINK SOFA
>EXAMINE THE SHINY COIN
>PUT THE RUSTY KEY IN
THE CARDBOARD BOX
>SHOW MY BOW TIE TO THE BOUNCER
>HIT THE CRAWLING CRAB WITH
THE GIANT NUTCRACKER

You can use multiple objects with certain verbs if you
separate them by the word AND or by a comma. Some examples:
>TAKE THE BOX AND
THE FROG
>DROP THE JAR OF PEANUT BUTTER, THE SPOON, AND THE LEMMING FOOD
>PUT
THE EGG AND THE PENCIL IN THE CABINET

You can include several inputs on one
line if you sparate them by the word THEN or by a period. Each input will be
handled in order, as though you had typed them individually at separate
prompts. For example, you could type all of the following at once, before
pressing the RETURN (or ENTER) key:
>TURN ON THE LIGHT. TAKE THE BOOK THEN READ
ABOUT THE JESTER IN THE BOOK.
If the STORY doesn't understand one of the
sentences on your input line, or if an unusual event occurs, it will ignore the
rest of your input line.

The words IT and ALL can be very useful. For
example:
>EXAMINE THE APPLE. TAKE IT. EAT IT.
>CLOSE THE HEAVY METAL DOOR. LOCK
IT.
>TAKE ALL
The word ALL refers to every visible object except those inside
something else. If there were an apple on the ground an an orange inside a
cabinet, TAKE ALL would take the apple but not the orange.
58006: (The following has been taken from the Masterpieces Of Infocom
manual)

BRIEF - This command fully describes a location only the first time
you enter it. On subsequent visits, only the nmae of the location and any
objects present will be described. The game will begin in BRIEF mode, and
remain in BRIEF mode unless you use the VERBOSE or SUPERBRIEF
commands.

SUPERBRIEF - This displays only the name of a place you have
entered, even if you have never been there before. In this mode, not even
objects are described. Of course, you can always get a full description of your
location and items there by typing LOOK. In SUPERBRIEF mode, the blank line
between turns will be eliminated. This mode is meant for players who are
already familiar with the geography.

VERBOSE - This gives a complete
description of each location, and the objects in it, every time you enter a
location, even if you've been there before.

INVENTORY - This will give you a
list of what you are carying and wearing. You can abbreviate INVENTORY to
I.

LOOK - This will give you a full description of your location. You can
abbreviate LOOK to L.

QUIT - This lets you stop. If you want to save your
position before quitting, you must use the SAVE command.

RESTORE - This
restores a previously saved position.

RESTART - This stops the story and
starts it over from the beginning.

SAVE - This saves a "snapshot" of your
current position. You can return to a saved position in the future using the
RESTORE command.

SCRIPT - This command tells your interpreter to begin making
a transcript of the story. A transript may aid your memory, but is not
necessary.

SCORE - This command will show your current score and ranking which
is based on the score.

UNSCRIPT - This tells your interpreter to stop making a
transcript.

VERSION - Shows you the release number and the serial number of
your copy of the story.

WAIT - Causes time in the story to pass. Since nothing
happens until you type a sentence and press RETURN (or ENTER), you could leave
your computer, take a nap, then return to the story to find that nothing has
changed. You can use WAIT to make time pass in the story without doing
anything. For example, if you meet a wzard, you might WAIT to see if he will
say anything; if you were about aboard a flying carpet, you might WAIT to see
where it goes.

Thank you for playing The Zuni Doll. I hope you enjoy it.
60550: mint-fiction often baffle him anyway.

He views Interactive Fiction as a
way to combine his two passions in life, Computer Science and Creative
Writing.

He currently resides at Lafayette College in Easton, PA where he is
working on a Bachlor of Science degree in Computer Science. He is also working
on an artificial intelligence project to model human emotions in autonomous
agents for use in interactive fiction.

The Zuni Doll is his first work of
interactive fiction released to the public.
61092: And of course,

Marina Kiriyeva who, despite her great dislike of text
adventures, has always listened to my ramblings and faithfully betatested this
and other works of interactive fiction by me.
61232: It is your warm blue bathrobe that you always wear around the apartment.
61284: You can't take off the bathrobe while the bathrobe tie is securing it.
61336: You're vulnerable enough as it is!
61364: You don't smoke but that's no reason not to carry around a lighter.
Besides, you like zipo lighters.
61436: The Zuni Doll is already on fire.
61464: As you try to set the Zuni Doll on fire it strikes out at your hand
scoring a hit in the center of your palm. You jerk back your hand droping the
lighter in the process. Luckily the lighter goes out.
61604: That might be a good idea. On the other hand it just might help the Zuni
Doll escape faster.
61672: I would really like to know how you would go about doing that.
61716: You extinguish the lighter for safety.
61744: You flick the lighter on and it burns with a bright yellow flame.
61848: It's a long thick strip of material used to keep your bathrobe closed.
61900: You can't do that if the bathrobe tie is tied around the bathrobe.
61948: You dangle the little bell from the bathrobe tie and ring it a few
times. Almost instantly Elmo dashes out from under the sofa. He drops the
little Talisman at our feet and pounces on the tie yanking it from your hands.
Elmo then proudly carries it away.
62124: A little paw darts out from under the sofa and bats at the dangling
bathrobe tie for a few seconds before losing interest.
62236: You tie the bathrobe tie around your waist and secure your bathrobe
shut.
62288: The bathrobe tie is too thick to tie around those things.
62328: You tie one end of the bathrobe tie to the ceremonial bell.
62372: The bathrobe isn't even tied to that right now.
62408: Not while it's tied around your waist.
62436: This room is small but serves its purpose well. The floor is carpeted
with a soft green rug and the walls are mostly bare except for a painting
depicting a lush pastoral scene. A window set in one wall gives a beautiful
view of the city. The main living room is to the east and your bathroom is to
the south.
62768: You have no idea who the artist is but you have always found this
painting very calming. That is why you have hung it over your bed.
62860: Up against one wall and taking up most of the room is your bed.
62904: It is a simple single bed just large enough to fit yourself.
62946: As you step off the bed you feel a sharp pain in your foot. Reflexively,
you jerk your leg up. Before you can fully obtain your balance you feel a
similar pain in your other foot. You pin wheel your arms trying to maintain
balance. Reaching out for anything to regain stability your arms knock over the
bedside lamp causing it to shatter across the floor.
63196: In your fall you lose your grip on the Talisman which goes skidding
across the floor. An instant later you see Elmo dashing after it. He picks it
up in his mouth and runs from the room.
63328: Out of the corner of your eye you see Elmo dashing from the room --
something golden glittering in his mouth.
63408: As you hit the ground you roll over to see what caused so much pain in
your feet. Crawling out from under the bed you see the malicious face of the
Zuni Doll. Its eyes glow red with the hate of the evil spirit trapped within
it. Before you can react the thing leaps at you emitting a blood curdling
tribal scream. You reach up to defend yourself as the Zuni Doll begins to slash
at your face with its little sword.
63696: A small golden Talisman lies in your lap where Elmo deposited it.
63744: The small golden Talisman when fastened would be hard put to serve you
as a ring. It is composed of a gold chain attached to a carved golden cylinder.
The symbols etched into the cylinder are meaningless to you.
63892: And bring that thing back to life? No way!
63924: A clean white sheet is draped over the top of the bed.
63964: It is an ordinary white bed sheet. Normally, it keeps you warm at night.
64016: The sheet is currently keeping the Zuni Doll occupied. However, you can
guess that it won't be long before the Zuni Doll slices its way out!
64116: No way are you letting that thing free!
64144: Elmo is cureled up on the bed resting peacefully.
64180: Elmo is your pet cat. He is a gray and black tiger striped short hair
with bright blue eyes. Elmo is on the small side for a male cat of six years.
64284: You wouldn't dream of hurting Elmo!
64340: You give Elmo a good snuggle. He purrs.
64372: Contrary to popular belief, Elmo is not asleep.
64408: Beside the bed is a small wooden table.
64436: The small wooden table is plain and simple. It bares only those features
it needs in order to serve its purpose.
64516: The lamp is mostly made of glass. Its body is decorated with literally
hundreds of tiny glass figures. You think that it tells a story but the scenes
are so randomly dispersed and tiny you have never been able to tell what the
story may be.
64680: Tiny glass shards are scattered about all over the floor.
64720: The tiny glass shards are what remain of your beautiful bedside lamp.
They sparkle and glitter in the light and, if it weren't for the fact that they
now make the area quite dangerous to walk through, they would make a nice
decoration.
64884: If you went that way barefooted as you are, you would cut your feet to
shreds on all the tiny glass shards.
64960: You don't want to cut your hands to ribbons.
64992: A stiff looking Zuni Doll is lying on the floor here.
65032: The Zuni doll is here attacking you fiercely!
65064: The Zuni doll is struggling to free itself from the sheet.
65108: The Zuni Doll is running around here on fire.
65144: The Zuni Doll is standing nearby preparing to kill you.
65184: The Zuni Doll is about one foot in height and is made of a tough
leathery material. Its head is misshapen and its long, razor-sharp teeth can be
seen protruding from its mouth. Its hair is long and black and it wears an
African ceremonial headdress
65356: You continue to struggle with the Zuni Doll but find yourself loosing
stamina. Suddenly the Zuni Doll gives a sudden and quick slash. You feel a pain
in your throat and liquid oozing down your neck. You being to feel dizzy and
slowly the room beings to fade...
65540: The Zuni Doll slashes madly at you! You fend it off with your hands but
you're not sure how long you can keep it up.
65624: The Zuni Doll slashes madly at you! You are amazed at the things
persistence. It seems to be single minded in its endeavor to rob you of your
life!
65730: The Zuni Doll slashes madly at you! You can't believe this things
stamina. It shows no sign of tiring and no sign of giving up.
65824: The Zuni Doll having fully recovered from your attack throws itself at
you. It tears into your leg with its little sword bringing you to your knees.
It then resumes its crazed slashing frenzy!
65960: The Zuni Doll is quickly recovering from your attack.
66000: The Zuni Doll is slashing madly in an attempt to free itself from the
sheet.
66056: The Zuni Doll suddenly leaps at you and plants his tiny sword right into
your left eye. Clasping your hands to your face you don't see what the Zuni
Doll does next but the pain intensifies greatly before fading away...
66210: The Zuni Doll leaps up onto the kitchen counter and glares at you.
66260: The Zuni Doll leaps from the counter top at you but you swiftly dodge to
the side. The Zuni Doll flies a short distance through the air before landing
inside the open freezer.
66384: The Zuni Doll leaps from the counter top at you but you swiftly dodge to
the side. The Zuni Doll flies a short distance through the air before it
colides with the freezer. It then lands, unharmed, on the floor.
66534: The Zuni Doll crawls out of the open freezer.
66570: The Zuni Doll having made its decision throws itself at you. It tears
into your leg with its little sword bringing you to your knees. It then begins
its crazed slashing frenzy!
66696: The Zuni Doll is beginning to escape from the freezer.
66736: The Zuni Doll is clearly contemplating the best way to kill you.
66784: As you attempt to flee from the room, the Zuni Doll lunges at you and
delivers a striking wound to your thigh! Your legs fall out from under you and
the Zuni Doll continues its relentless attack.
66920: You struggle with the Zuni Doll but you can't free yourself long enough
to do that.
66980: You struggle with the Zuni Doll but you can't free yourself long enough
to do that.
67040: The Zuni Doll is definitely a kill first ask questions later kind of
individual.
67096: Do you actually expect to NEGOTIATE with the Zuni Doll?
67144: If the Zuni Doll is asleep you'd hate to see what it's like when it's
awake!
67200: The Zuni Doll slashes wildly at you! Finally you manage to get a grip on
the thing. You are amazed at how strong the thing is. You give it a hardy shove
and toss it nearly across the room.
67332: You lunge at the tiny Zuni Doll. The thing is just too swift for you and
dodges out of the way. You go sprawling across the floor but quickly spring to
your feet and turn to face the menacing Doll.
67472: You throw the sheet over the Zuni Doll. Beneath it you can see the Zuni
Doll struggling to get free. You assume you don't have much time before the
thing slices its way free.
67596: You launch the French knife at the Zuni Doll and score a direct hit
square in the Zuni Doll's chest. It goes flying backwards a few feet and then
lies still.

Suddenly, it sits up and pulls the knife out of its chest. It
looks at the large French knife, then at its own small sword and then back at
the French knife before throwing away the small sword. It then advances on you
with its new found superior weapon.
67888: at the Zuni Doll. Unfortunately, the Zuni Doll is just too swift and
dodges out of the way!
67956: Through the open door you see the Zuni Doll finally free itself from the
sheet. It begins advancing upon the open door.
68042: The Zuni Doll comes racing in through the open door and delivers a
vicious blow to your ankle. You stumble and before you can react the Zuni Doll
drives its little blade repeatedly into your throat...
68186: Through the open door you can see the Zuni advancing on the door with
frightening speed!
68250: The Zuni Doll throws the bathroom door open and lunges at you. It plants
its tiny blade square into your chest and then slides down your body ripping a
long bloody chasm in your torso...
68384: You hear the Zuni Doll collide with the closed bathroom door. For a
moment you hear nothing and then you see the handle on the bathroom door slowly
beginning to turn.
68500: The Zuni Doll begins slashing wildly at the at the bathroom door. The
door should hold up for a while but who knows for how long.
68592: The Zuni Doll continues to hack away at the door. Little bulges are
beginning to form on this side of the door.
68672: The Zuni Doll shows no sign of tiring. It continues to hack away at the
door. Splinters are starting to fly away from the wood.
68764: Certainly the door will give soon. A tiny hole has already formed
through which the point of the Zuni Doll's sword can be seen.
68856: The cracking and crunching is becoming unbearable! The hole is quite a
bit larger now. You can hear the horrible little cry of the Zuni Doll as it
relentlessly hacks its way through.
68984: You don't think the door will hold much longer and the Zuni Doll shows
no sign of giving up. A sizable hole has already formed through which you can
see the Zuni Doll's slashing little arm.
69118: The door finally gives way and the Zuni Doll bursts into the room. It
looks at you evilly.
69186: You can hear the Zuni Doll banging around inside the freezer looking for
a way to escape.
69252: The tiny blade is no longer than six inches long and half an inch wide
but it is razor sharp.
69316: What is left of the shredded sheet is piled on the floor.
69356: This is what is left of your white sheet. It has been completely
shredded into tiny pieces.
69420: It is just the door that joins the bathroom with your bedroom.
69464: The bathroom door is open.
69484: The bathroom door is closed.
69504: The Zuni Doll comes racing in through the open door!
69544: The hole is about 1 foot in diameter and is irregular in shape. Sharp
and jagged splinters stick out all around it along the sides.
69636: The bathroom is painted that soothing institutional green color and the
floor is covered with cream white tiles. Other than that it is furnished with
all the usual fixings.
69756: As you attempt to flee the Zuni Doll plunges its sword into your back
and a numbing sensation spreads through your lower body. Everything goes dark
as you hit the floor...
69876: No way are you going back out there with that thing!
69912: You hastily turn on the sink and splash water all over your face.
Nothing however has changed so you turn the sink off.
69996: Hanging on the wall over the sink you see a mirrored medicine cabinet.
70044: In the mirror on the cabinet you see your own terrorfied reflection.
70092: At one point in your life you used this stuff religiously. However, this
bottle is probably very near empty if it has anything at all.
70188: Nothing happens. It appears the canister has gone empty.
70228: This bottle of hairspray has always been slightly defective. You've
always had to use both hands in order to get the bottle to spray. As a result
you can't spray
70344: A jettison of flame engulfs the Zuni Doll as the flammable hairspray
passes through the lighter flame. The Zuni Doll emits a shrieking cry and runs
flaming from the room!
70464: As the flammable spray passes through the flame of the lighter a great
fireball bathes your head. You suppose that this is better than letting the
Zuni Doll get you...
70584: As the flammable spray passes through the lighter flame is bursts into a
ball of fire. Your bathrobe quickly catches on fire turning you into a human
marshmellow...
70700: A great tongue of fire erupts from the canister as the flammable liquid
passes through the flame of the lighter. Within seconds
70788: You bathe your head in a stream of hairspray. You figure, if you're
going to die at least die in style.
70864: . While making it perhaps a bit stiffer, nothing else seems to happen.
70972: You really should use this stuff more often.
71060: Tossed into the corner are a pair of warm slippers.
71096: These are the slippers you usually wear around the house in the winter
to keep your feet warm.
71160: With your feet protected by the slippers you carefully cross over into
the living room.
71222: As you walk into the room you see that the Zuni Doll has managed to stop
itself from burning. It doesn't look entirely pleased with you.
71324: This large room serves as the main area to your apartment. The walls are
bare and painted an unobtrusive shade of white. The floor is covered from wall
to wall with a light beige carpet. To the west lies your bedroom, to the east
is a small kitchen area and the front door is to the north
71524: You're not going in the bedroom with your feet unprotected. All that
broken glass will rip your feet to shreds.
71604: The front door is closed.
71624: The front door leads out to the hallway of the apartment building. You
take a close look and notice that the knob on the dead bolt has been roughly
cut off. There is no way you will get this door open.
71764: You scramble to the door and reach for the dead bolt. As you do, you see
that the knob has been sawn off. No way will you unlock the door now.
71864: In the center of the room is a long wooden coffee table.
71904: This coffee table acts as the main horizontal surface in this room. Who
knows how many things have graced its surface?
71988: Along side the coffee table is your comfy plush sofa.
72028: Many fond hours of napping, reading and eating have been spent lounging
on this sofa.
72088: Beneath the couch you see two glowing objects that you immediately
recognize as Elmo's eyes. Nearby is another object that occasionly catches the
light and glints of gold
72208: It took three people to put this couch where it is now. No way are you
going to move it by yourself.
72280: Under the current circumstances if you were to lie down you might never
get up again.
72368: Up against one wall is a simple writing desk.
72400: This is the simple writing desk that you use primarily for filling out
paperwork and paying bills. Right now it is cluttered with so much junk that
you figure there isn't any more room left on top of it for anything else. And
it doesn't do much better as a container as it only contains one central
drawer.
72612: Having broken the lock open before, you doubt you will be able to get it
to lock again.
72672: You begin to fiddle with the lock on the desk drawer but you suddenly
feel a sharp pain in your back and you fall to the ground. You roll over and
see the Zuni Doll leaping towards you. It begins its merciless slashing.
72900: You stick the small sword in the lock and give it a hard twist. You hear
a springy snap sound in response.
72976: You recognize this key as the one that opens your collectibles cabinet.
73028: This is one of those thick heavy-duty rubber bands that are often
wrapped around large bundles.
73124: The rubber band is already attached to the divining rod.
73224: You unattach the rubber band from the divining rod.
73260: Tucked into one corner of the room is your colectibles cabinet.
73304: This small wooden cabinet is where you began putting your collection of
mysterious items and artifacts.
73376: You found this silver ceremonial bell in a curio shop about three weeks
ago. Supposedly, it is used to chase away evil spirits.
73464: The little sliver bell makes a resounding ringing tone but nothing else
seems to happen.
73524: You ring the little bell and note some sounds coming from under the
sofa.
73644: You attach the golden Talisman loosely to the rubber band.
73688: The Talisman is already loaded into the divining rod.
73728: That wouldn't make good ammunition.
73756: The divining rod isn't loaded with anything.
73788: You take careful aim with the divining rod and pull back the rubber
band. Just as the Zuni Doll leaps, you let go! The Talisman flies through the
air and catches the Zuni Doll square in the throat. The little golden chain
wraps around the Zuni Doll's neck and fastens together with a soft tinkle. The
Zuni Doll stiffens almost immediately and falls lifeless to the ground.
74052: This small area serves as a kitchen area. The walls are done in a nice
teak coloring and the floor is covered in smooth yellow linoleum. Considering
that you either eat out, or order in most of the time, you rarely ever see this
room. The living room lies to the west.
74240: Dominating the center of the room is a long shiny toped counter.
74284: On top of this counter is where you prepare your food, if ever.
74328: This is a classic French knife used in preparing food. Since it is
rarely used it is still quite sharp.
74400: As you pick up the French knife you notice that things have become oddly
quiet in the living room.
74468: Set into one wall behind the counter is a small freezer unit.
74512: You cleaned out the freezer a few days ago. So, you know for a fact that
it's empty.
74572: Embedded in one end of the counter is a small electric disposal unit.
74620: The disposal unit is used for quickly disposing of unwanted food items.
Simply deposit said items into it and turn it on.
74704: You flip the switch on the disposal unit and it grinds away. Within
seconds the Zuni Doll is ground up and sucked away. When the last of it is gone
you flip the disposal off. You walk slowly through your living room and pass
into your bedroom being careful to avoid the glass shards.

Collapsing into bed
you see Elmo sleeping peacefully on the edge. You pick him up and hold him in
your arms. You lie down and stare at the ceiling for a few moments before you
pass into sleep. You're last thoughts are that you should give up the
mysterious items and artifact collection. It's just not worth it.
75120: You flip the switch on the disposal and its contents are quickly
destroyed. You turn the disposal back off once it is empty.
75208: You run the disposal for a few seconds but since it is empty you quickly
turn if off again.
