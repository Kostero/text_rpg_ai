daughter Crystal became more and more ill as the days went by, until she
finally died in searing agony, blinded and paralised by her illness.
43875: The water slides down your throat, and you feel refreshed.
43934: You step through the opening in the wall.
43979: It is a large stone wall carved into the rock face. There is a small
opening in it.
44038: This large stone wall looks as if it was purposely crafted from the rock
face for some reason. There is definately no way around it.
44144: You step through the opening in the wall.
44476: You thrust the knife deep into the heart of the orc. It screams and
writhes about in agony for a few seconds and then falls dead on the floor in a
pool of blood.
Two other orcs run out of the nearby trees and drag the body
away.
44635: You have nothing with which to kill the orc.
44703: You are already in your cottage.
44754: In her weak state she succums to your violent actions quickly. Very soon
Crystal lays dead in her bed. Murdered by her own father! The idea was to save
her life, not take it.
44903: As the coin splashes into the water of the fountain there is a bright
flash and you see that the gold coin has become a golden flute.
45102: You take some of the magic clover leaves.
45151: Well Done! You have saved Crystal's life. 
Even as you feed the clover
leaves to your daughter, you notice her perk up. After only a few days she has
fully recovered. You decide to keep a few of the leaves in case they are needed
in the future.
45335: The water slides down your throat, and you feel refreshed.
45401: kipn

Your daughter Crystal has recently become ill, but you do not know
why. It is obvious to you that if she isn't cured soon she will die. You have
heard stories about a magical plant which grows somewhere around this region,
but you have never actually seen it. It is said to be able to cure any illness.
You must set off to find it. It is your only chance to save your daughter.


Good luck!

46448: There are bits and pieces of old clothing and broken furniture strewn
about the cave. Anything could be hidden under them.
46532: It is a small cave dimly lit by the light from the entrance. It looks as
if it was once inhabited.
46600: The forest is less dense here. There is a little light breaking through
the treetops. A few feet away you can see the remains of a small fire. 


Exits: East and Southeast.
46724: On closer inspection it seems that many documents and pieces of paper
have been burned in this fire.

Southwest.
47212: It is the entrance to a small dark cave.

Exits: North, South, East, West, Northwest, Southwest and Southeast.
48478: You find yourself in a small alcove just off the North road. You see a
small ornate water fountain here. It seems to have been put here for weary
travellers in need of a drink. 

 Exits: West.
48620: This fountain has obviously been frequented by many travellers passing
through the region as can be seen by the worn stone sides. It is very
decorative. It must have taken a long time to carve all of these designs into
the bare stone.

48814: are standing in a small clearing on the edge of the forest surrounded by
many large rocks and boulders.

to the east, whereas to the west you see the road stretch into the distance. 


Exits: West, East and Southwest.
49684: This old sign has been here a very long time. It is badly weathered. The
red writing on it seems to suggest it is important. Perhaps you would be well
advised to read it.
49804: An old sign stands at the side of the road.
49834: This is the end of the east road. Heading east will take you deep into a
very dangerous looking wood. You feel very wary. Going west takes you back to
the road. 

 Exits: West and East.
49972: This creature is very ugly. He also seems a little peeved that you have
disturbed him. Orcs aren't the best choice of creature to go around annoying.
50076: A large angry orc blocks your path.
50102: You can barely see anything in the small amount of light penetrating the
thick leafy canopy above. You feel as if a hundred pairs of eyes are watching
you. You'll be glad to leave this place. A strange carving on a tree near you
catches your attention. 

 Exits: West.
50294: The carving looks as if it has been made with a blunt knife. It is
difficult to read, but you work out it says something like... 

               
 'Walls have ears'

of birds can be heard in the treetops. 

 Exits: North, South, East, Northwest

little cottage. It is totally silent here, even the birds have stopped 
singing. To the North is the East road. 

 Exits: There are exits in all
directions.
50704: It is your home. The little cottage you built yourself many years ago,
although the age doesnt show at all. You are very proud of this cottage. You
and you daughter Crystal had lived here quite happily until she became ill.

of birds can be heard in the treetops. 

 Exits: North, South, West, Northwest

of birds can be heard in the treetops. 

 Exits: North and Northeast.
51086: This is your home. A small cottage that you built for you and your
daughter. Made from the wood of the surrounding trees, it blends in very well
with the surroundings. The room is not well furnished. There is just a table,
an old stove and two beds. In one of the beds lies your daughter, Crystal. Set
in the south wall of the cottage is a small square window. 

 Exits: Exit.
51356: Through the small window you can see the trees outside and many small
creatures scurrying about on the ground rummaging in the leaves for food.
51456: It is a simple wooden table. It seems to be made from the same wood as
the cottage.
51516: There are just the two beds here. Very simple in design but very
comfortable. In one of the beds lies your sick daughter.
51604: This is the stove where you cook all your meals. It might not look much
but it has served you well.
51676: This is your daughter Crystal. She looks very ill. It wont be long now
before she dies unless you can cure her.
51756: Your daughter Crystal is here lying on her bed.
51790: This is a very scenic part of the wood. The sun shines through the
branches of the trees. Bird song can be heard all around. 

 Exits: North,
South and Northwest.
51910: You stand at the back of your house. The view is stunning. You can see
right to the horizon between the trees. 

 Exits: East.
52004: It is a little darker here, with the trees being taller and denser, but
there is still plenty of light to allow many plants to grow. 

 Exits: North
and West.
52120: A shiny new gold coin with a picture of a fountain on one side and some
sort of plant on the other. It looks like it will come in handy.
52216: This old torn note looks as if it has been ripped from someones diary or
notebook. There is some writing on it.
52296: These are the leaves of the magical clover plant. Legend has it that
they can cure any illness if eaten.
52372: It is a very sharp little knife. You usually use it for sharpening
sticks but it could be a very effective weapon.
52452: The cool clear water looks very refreshing.
52484: It is the most beautifully crafted flute you have ever seen. Every
detail has been perfected. It is made from pure gold.
