it and descend into its ruins.
70784: Real world directions applied only in the real world.
70824: First I would have had to escape the mirror.
70856: Passion was too much Purpose for me to consider at that time.
70900: I could not harm a summoner directly, but there were opportunities to do
so in the context of Purpose.
70972: When I wanted to communicate verbally, I would [talk to the "summoner"].
71032: I had not yet told my Purpose to my summoner.
71064: My summoner had not yet stated a wish.

71284: The tents and trees were typical of human settlements in the desert.
71332: The area was completely desolate.
71356: Other than my container, I had no need to enter things.
71496: Somehow, however, I did not derive the Purpose that I felt I should have
from doing all that.
71608: I was unable to use articles in such a manner.
71778: I entered my container only when no more Purpose was to be had.
71874: I could not depart until I was summoned anew.
71908: My opportunity for freedom was certainly elsewhere.
71944: I knew then I needed to be in the Room of Choices before I entered my
container.
72004: I could not enter the container of a different name.
72076: I could not depart until I was summoned anew.
72112: I was unable to enter my container until the wish of my summoner had
been fulfilled.
72172: My container could not contain such Purpose.
72204: I knew then I needed to be in the Room of Choices before I entered my
container.
72450: I could not depart until I was summoned anew.
72484: I found Destiny to be much stronger than my Purpose to move the lamp.
72618: The necklace desolidified and then descended through the earth.
72664: Destiny called upon me to enter it.
72692: I could not take things from my summoner.
72768: I was unable to use articles in such a manner.
72940: I did not have the Purpose to do so.
73042: Sela observed the action with dispassion.
73072: Score was of vital importance to many of my summoners.
73110: I searched the undercurrents for one that would fulfill my summoner's
stated desire.  Of those that would accomplish this, only one was I Willful
enough to channel.

The undercurrent that would alter my summoner's physical
appearance was, by itself, more Purposeful than I could manage.  But if I
simultaneously channeled an attractor current, I could integrate them through
my summoner and fulfill the wish.  I chose the undercurrent of

1) 
lycanthropy.
2)  a deep sleep.
3)  an inhumanly shrill voice.
73480: My recent exponential increase in Purpose evoked in me an awareness. 
The attractor winds that gave me control of the undercurrents were viewed as
curses by my summoners.  By the time the summoner called upon me anew, any
Satisfaction that might have been gained initially was eliminated by these
curses.

Why had Seegan been Satisfied?  I knew only one possibility.  She was
without San.
73774: I searched the undercurrents for one that would fulfill my summoner's
stated desire.  Two of the requirements were a long and healthy life for her
baby.
73942: The were-fox undercurrent needed redirection at that point in time or be
integrated fully soon after.
74124: And to that point, never did I derive subsequent Satisfaction.
74382: Her baby had strong undercurrents of happiness.  I would not need to do
anything to grant that portion of the wish.  However, prosperity was another
matter.
74500: Fortunately, I had the deed that would restore the nobility of her
husband.
74574: I could have channeled the undercurrents to make that happen, but not
without cost.  I realized that I greatly risked Satisfaction if I attached a
curse.  Perhaps there was treasure still remaining somewhere around the vaults
that could assure prosperity.
74754: At first I did not know where to begin.  Eventually I realized I was
able to manipulate my own undercurrents through those of Seegan.  Without her
wish, I would have never been able to achieve that.

The Purpose undercurrents
were strong, but her physical link to them was weakening rapidly.  I connected
my own limited Purpose to the stream with her help.  As I did so, her link
completely dissipated.

The final wish was granted.
75096: *An implosion of Satisfaction.*

Such was my first experience of joy. 
Until that point in time, every summoner returning for another wish had
increased San.  Through the happiness of Seegan, I felt more Purpose than I had
ever known.
75272: *An implosion of Satisfaction.*

Seegan returned, although her physical
currents had ceased.  She was a spirit, but her Purpose was still her own.
75384: They did no damage, but I felt their associated sensations.
75428: Now closer in Purpose to physical beings, I began to feel some of the
effects these traps caused.
75496: *An implosion of Purpose* 

A summons from mere existence.  The
scattered undercurrents of Purpose integrated me, established meaning.

A wish
diminished me.  I fulfilled my summoner's desire expending Purpose.  I returned
to my container before I was lost forever.
75694: The location of my summoner was a room between the surface of the world
[physically west] and a complex of vaults [physically east].

The room was a
trap for physical beings.  On one side of the room
75948: I was not impeded by the elements of the physical world.  The farther I
traveled from the location of my initial summons, the more Purpose I
expended.

Then too I realized where I was and could [recall the area] whenever
I needed.
76220: A thick, stone wall blocked physical travel west.
76294: There were doors on the northern and southern sides, each with a set of
uniquely engraved runes.
76450: All but one piece of jewelry had been taken.
76542: The room had many unique items stored there, but I was not concerned
with them.

I sensed strong undercurrents from
76948: How my ring returned to the vault, I could only speculate.
76992: Although the room was empty, I felt the integrated traces of physical
metals and San that once dwelt here.
77124: The room had many papers stored there.

I sensed strong undercurrents
from
77404: I felt no sense of Purpose there.
77430: I rose higher above the surface.
77456: The snow-covered hills appeared taller when viewed from the surface of
the trail.
77612: I found myself without the Purpose to retreat from Destiny.
77656: I found myself without the Purpose to retreat from Destiny.
77700: I found myself without the Purpose to retreat from Destiny.
77744: I found myself without the Purpose to retreat from Destiny.
77788: I found myself without the Purpose to retreat from Destiny.
77832: I found myself without the Purpose to retreat from Destiny.
77876: I found myself without the Purpose to retreat from Destiny.
77920: I found myself without the Purpose to retreat from Destiny.
77964: I found myself without the Purpose to retreat from Destiny.
78146: A small circle had been inscribed around the exact center of the
room.

I saw the beginnings of many undercurrents there.  That room would soon
be a focal point for a cataclysmic occurrence.
78336: Maps were placed throughout.
78360: Private tents followed the rows of trees there.
78396: The area was completely desolate.
78420: Private tents followed the rows of trees there.
78456: The area was completely desolate.
78480: There were several silos where the humans stored their grain.
78524: The area was completely desolate.
78548: Private tents followed the rows of trees there.
78584: The area was completely desolate.
78608: I sensed strong undercurrents from that place the humans were
excavating.
78660: The site still existed, but none of what the humans had in place there
was.
78712: I sensed strong undercurrents from that place the humans were
excavating.
78764: I had destroyed what the humans had constructed within the site, but
that time I had formed a sand tunnel leading down.
78848: At that time, I had not the promise of Purpose to create a tunnel down.
78900: As was my nature, I would have to destroy in order to create.
78944: The spring of fresh water marked the center of the oasis.
78984: There was evidence that a spring existed there.
79020: The camels had been trained and were equipped for battle.
79060: That section of the oasis once contained animals.
79096: There were tents here which contained military supplies.
79136: That section of the oasis was destroyed.
79268: Ash was the only thing left of the bulwark.
79300: Sand dunes faded into the horizon in all directions.
79396: The air supports I created held the loose sand walls in tact.
79440: I sensed something farther down.
79468: I did not wish to expend Purpose digging mindlessly.
79660: There was no Purpose in tunneling that way.
79692: I needed Purpose immediately and sensed an intense source of it in the
adjacent room.
79752: Labiiq appeared on a flying carpet.  "Thank you again for your indirect
and unintentional services.  You have provided the box that will secure my
promotion but that would have surely destroyed me had I opened it.

The
wish-granting djinni may be below, but I have far too much San to use it
safely.  Still, I was not speaking falsely about the prophecy.  Surely your
Destiny is in that Room."

With those words he grabbed the box from the
adjacent room, nodded to me a final time and flew away.
80104: The room had many unique items stored there, but I was not concerned
with them.

I sensed strong undercurrents from
80188: There was no Purpose in tunneling that way.
80220: Sela occupied the majority of the room.
80776: ' do that m'lady.  You're the most beautiful in the land," said the
second guard.

In a clear view by then, I could see two men slowly, very
slowly, drawing conclusions from the conversation that had just transpired.
80932: The road through the gates was narrow, the gates were made of steel.
81108: To a summoner, I appeared no more than a scattered haze.
81148: To a summoner, I appeared to be a concentrated haze though with no real
form.
81204: To a summoner, I appeared as a powerful though insubstantial human.
81288: I was impressive to behold.
81376: I was terrible to behold.
81396: I appeared the same as my beholder.
81424: I appeared in form the same as my beholder, though with a certain
ethereal quality.
81484: I had traces of my beholder's appearance, but I was mostly ethereal.
81534: I returned to my container with no Purpose to spare.
81614: *An implosion of Purpose*

Each summons meant the opportunity to
destroy.  Only the destruction that caused human suffering gave me subsequent
Purpose.

In the context of my permitted existences, I had never been able to
sustain Purpose.  I would be forced to return to my bottle, each time desiring
the trip to be my last.  I knew with enough Purpose I could be free of any
summoners, free to cause limitless destruction.
81952: *An implosion of Purpose*

*An implosion of Satisfaction*

Rarely was I
summoned again by the same human.  Never were any pleased with what I
accomplished.  Until then.  Perhaps his Satisfaction could be used to gain
enough Purpose for my permanent freedom.
82190: *An implosion of Purpose*

"Mirror, mirror, in my hand
Who's the fairest
in the land?"

As the servant of the mirror, I was compelled to answer my
summoner truthfully.  I replied to her as I had many times to that same
question.

"What I say to you is true
No girl alive is as fair as you"
82452: "As sure as the moon, I'll see my face soon," said Sela.  With that, she
set my hand mirror down.
82572: *An implosion of Purpose*

Again, Sela held the mirror and asked a
question.

"Mirror, mirror, I must know more
Are any more beautiful that came
before?" 

That question was somewhat unexpected since I had heard her previous
one so many times.  Yet, always, eventually, a summoner would ask a question
that required a disappointing answer.  And when her Will was low I would absorb
her essence into the mirror, gaining all the more knowledge. 

I
replied,
"Alas, a fairer girl did once abide
Her name was Seegan, I must
confide"
82994: *An implosion of Satisfaction*

Except for Seegan and Labiiq, my
previous summoners were consumed with Aje.  Sela then too was without it.  A
challenge awaited and her resolve hardened, her Will became high.  At that
moment, I possessed more Purpose than I had since Labiiq.

When Purpose was
integrated sufficiently, I could move reflected objects near me to the void of
the non-reflected.  And I would be able to implement the final segment of my
plan if she agreed to my proposal.
83970: Sela did think on this proposition.
84072: I strove to gain Purpose, not to take it away from myself.
84116: Destroying things of human import gave me Purpose, things not so took it
away.
84216: Rarely did this fulfill the wishes of my summoner.
84350: Its "neck" was tapered to a sharp point.
84380: This deed bestows the title VISCOUNT upon Roald Exeter.
84428: The undercurrents of Exeter were linked strongly to Seegan but were not
her own.
84484: Only one of the deeds had any relevance--the deed of nobility.
84528: I did not want to expend Purpose channeling all of the deeds. Only the
deed of nobility had relevant undercurrents.
84608: It was a brass lamp with the name "Canloc" inscribed on its base.
84732: inscribed upon it was the name "Ivogard".
84764: I could not take things from my summoner.
84796: I was the only one able to enter the ring.
84828: I found the remains to be no different than any other.
84868: The summoner known as Seegan stood before me.
84958: Her mental flows darted and crackled with creativity.
85104: Her mental flows darted and crackled with creativity.
85250: Her mental flows darted and crackled with creativity.
85458: She wore the ring that contained my essence.
85678: The third, ten years on the day and in the same location.
85718: I told her that, in addition to the previous rules, I could not undo any
direct effects of previous wishes.

(I wondered then whether I should have told
her about my new Purpose.  Thanking her seemed "correct" somehow and yet not
"appropriate" because it would likely have interfered with many undercurrents.)
85940: Seegan stared at me.  Her eyes had the typical glaze of awe but lacked
the typical glimmer of San.
86010: Seegan asked me, "are you a djinni?"
86042: Seegan took out a hand mirror, looked at it for a final assessment and
then put it away.  She told me, "I've thought about it, and I wish to be
beautiful."
86158: "Great Djinni," my summoner said with much passion.  "I can't thank you
enough--not only for making me beautiful, but for giving me the extra gift of
86270: being able to turn into a fox.  I escaped these vaults because in fox
form I was able to slip between the bars and dash quickly to the nearest
village.
86380: the most pleasant sleep I have ever experienced.  My... YOUR ring kept
me warm somehow, as long as I was wearing it.  I awoke months later when a
traveling soldier arrived here and escorted me to the nearest village.
86538: a magical voice.  I shattered the bars with my scream and followed the
trail back to the village."  (I, being not human, was unaffected by her
voice.)

"
86652: It was at that village I met my husband.  I owe you that thanks as well.
 I know I didn't need to explain, but I wanted to express my happiness.

Do you
have any further instructions for my second wish?  I will await your word
before wishing."
86826: "I've known my second wish since I knew I was pregnant.  I wish my baby
a long, healthy, happy, prosperous life."
86914: My summoner spoke to me.  "Djinni, you made my life not only happy and
fulfilling but also Purposeful.  I could not have asked for more.

I died
87040: The human body cannot handle such frequent and disrupting changes to
itself.
87284: It cost me my own life the process, but what mother wouldn't give her
own for her child?
87346: But I gained immeasurably from my wishes and wouldn't change a thing. 
My last wish is for you."
87438: "It was foretold that it was my Destiny to come here, that I was to wish
my heart's desire.  I did not understand the implications of all that had
transpired then and what a pawn I was.  Now, in my afterlife, I do.

You are to
go to the Room of Choices and stay there until the little boy arrives.  Destiny
will be decided there.  If the three choices are in place, the boy will select
which servant to unleash unchecked in the world and thereby its course.  If
not, Will ceases to exist.

You will require much Purpose in order to reach
this room.  Thus, my last wish is for you to gain that Purpose.  Good luck, my
friend."
87890: The bonds that regenerated me when I was in my summoner's presence,
dissipated.
87952: The summoner known as Seegan slept before me.
87984: The summoner known as Seegan stood before me.
88016: The summoner known as Seegan rested before me.
88052: The spirit of Seegan floated before me.
88080: "Surely you tempt me, Djinni.  I came not for treasure but for my
Destiny," Seegan said from the entry room.
88280: Labiiq looked out at me, expectantly.  Summoners would wait for me to
destroy their enemies, only to learn I destroyed anything to cause human
misery.
88386: Labiiq looked out at me, expectantly.
88416: Rather than the look of horror most summoners had by that point, Labiiq
cast a calm and knowing presence upon me.
88496: Labiiq stopped to examine some maps.
88524: A soldier reported and then ran out of the tent.
88560: Labiiq drank some water and walked around a bit.
88596: A junior officer awaited orders at attention.  Minutes later, he left.
88648: Labiiq stared into a hand mirror for several seconds and then put it
away.
88700: Labiiq looked out at me, calmly.  "I know you rarely honor requests, but
I think you'll feel differently when you hear mine.  First a little
background...

Research from my dig has revealed the location of others of your
kind.  According to my scrolls, three powerful servants are to wait in a "Room
of Choices" for a little boy.  It will be this boy who chooses the fate of the
people.

Now I won't confirm or deny the validity of this prophecy, but the
time for this event is unspecified.  Even if three of you are supposed to be
there, there is no mention of when this is to occur.  Other scrolls on this
matter claim there are different types of "servants."  Some can grant wishes,
some exist to wreak havoc, and so on.

I believe this "Room of Choices" is far
below my excavation site.  I believe there is a chance a wish-granting servant
is there.  I don't believe my men will ever be able to dig below these shifting
sands enough to reach there.

By explaining all of this, I'm giving you an
opportunity to build your power and to be one of the choices.  To build your
power in the short term, my studies indicate following your nature.  To build
your power permanently, you need to become the chosen one.  If you're so
chosen, my studies indicate you will have your permanent freedom and even
dominion in the world to come.

But first you must get me the wish granter's
container."
89682: The bonds that regenerated me when I was in my summoner's presence,
dissipated.
89744: Shortly thereafter, the enemies of Labiiq sensed weakness in his camp. 
They left their nearby desert posts and stormed his oasis.
89840: With the bulwark destroyed, they entered easily...
89880: They discovered an opening in the bulwark and rushed in...
89922: Only to find a Purpose-starved servant waiting for them.
89992: Afterwards there was nothing of real import nearby to destroy.  Soon I
found myself confronted with the detestable necessity of returning to my
container.
90104: Sela gazed into the mirror.
90124: As human consensus judged such things, she was the most beautiful woman
who lived at that time.
90192: Sela stood near with mirror in hand.
90218: Sela calmly put my mirror back in her pack.

She did not summon me again
until she had placed me on the empty pedestal in the Room of Choices.  I told
her truthfully that the lamp she sought was dangerous, so that she need merely
speak the name inscribed upon it--'Canloc'--to invoke the djinni within.

San
influenced her wish in its typical way.

I awaited Destiny.
90524: "A little boy entered the Room.  He stood on his toes to reach the top
of one of the pedestals.
90598: "Which one did he choose, Nanny Exeter?!" 

"We live in a world where
the only servants are human, my child.  Think on that as you fall asleep.  Good
night, sweet one."
90808: In the tussle, the mirror fell from her hand and broke.
90848: "The risk-reward is fair I feel
I say to you we have a deal," said
Sela.
"How do I reach this 'Room' that you mention?
And how shall I leave, by
what convention?"

I replied,
"An earthly servant shall take you down
First
pack your bags and leave this town
Meet it at the Heart of Clay
It owes the
mirror a favor, say

When you reach the place of stands
Where Destiny combines
its strands
Set me on the final top
Make sure I stay, I must not drop

The lamp
awaits for whom would speak
Its magic word, its name unique
To leave the way
your kind has done
Just step into the middle sun

On your trip if help is
needed
Pick me up for objects weeded"

Sela set me down and presumably readied
herself for her journey.
91388: Sela was detained for questioning, nonchalantly holding up her mirror.
91572: I could not take things from my summoner.
91604: I was the only one able to enter the ring.
91636: Her physical undercurrents had ceased.
91758: She was with child.
91772: Her undercurrents continued their warmth but now flowed with the winds
and not against them.
91888: In another circumstance, perhaps, she would have been considered
physically desirable.
91948: Her emotional undercurrents were like the serenity of a pond on a
windless day.
92278: Deep within these flurries was a pocket of fear, apparently kept in
check by the torrent outside.
92416: These winds were conditioned, although not ruled, by her emotions.
92566: When the correct stones were pressed, the wall became a sliding door.
92614: Since I could pass through stone, I did not concern myself with its
unlocking sequence.
92706: One stone protruded prominently from the rest and was colored brown.
92754: There was a door-sized opening in the wall.
92792: I felt a physical connection to the portcullis.
92936: I felt a physical connection to the portcullis.
92972: The brown stone was integrated with the wall and gave it Purpose.
93068: I touched the stone, and an opening appeared within the center of the
wall.
93120: I touched the stone, and the opening was gone.
93206: Wind was blowing through the spaces.
93232: The bars had since shattered and were no more.
93264: Only if it were wished for would I have expended Purpose doing that.
93312: The vault was built inside a hill.
93476: I could not see the trail from my location.
93558: There were no disturbances on the trail.
93588: The sky touched the hills at the horizon.
93620: The sky was humid and gray.
93640: The items that did not generate strong undercurrents were of no interest
to me.
93888: Other than an inscribed name, "Ivogard", I saw nothing special about the
necklace.
94072: The iron necklace was inscribed "Ivogard".
94188: The pedestal was not meant to hold that.
94300: The pedestals were not meant to hold that.
94332: The undercurrents of that circle linked to a physical location on the
surface.
94438: My container, a bottle, was strapped to his side.
94476: Other than my container, I had no need to enter things.
94542: Rare indeed did a summoner take precautions against me.
94582: Only one of the maps interested me--Labiiq's camp:
94932: The maps, like the tent here, were protected from me somehow.
94976: There was the water supply for the entire camp.
95012: There was nothing left of the spring.
95100: Unexpectedly, I did not derive the Purpose that I felt I should have
from doing that.
95194: No humans were guarding their precious commodity.
95228: The area was completely destroyed.
95252: I could have burned the silos down, but instead I ripped the silos open
with my bare hands and crushed the parts into insignificant bits.  I blew the
grain into the desert, and soon nothing was left in the area.

Causing the loss
of vital sustenance should have given me much more Purpose than it did.
95500: Something below was Destiny.
95574: I froze the hole and whatever its contents may have been.  Then I
shattered the ice, breaking everything.

I did not gain the Purpose I should
have from doing that.
95856: But Destiny had always made Itself easy to follow.
95968: There were one hundred ten camels there.
95996: I thought to add to the misery of the humans not by destroying the
camels directly but by forcing them from the oasis and into the desert.  The
humans could see their only source of transportation slowly leave them.

This
did not translate to Purpose, however.
96176: The Purpose to be gained was not worth even the minimal of efforts.
96224: There were military supplies there, but I did not concern myself with
them.
96280: The area was completely destroyed.
96304: I summoned a cloud that formed over the tent.  The cloud rained acid. 
Everything was destroyed.

Normally I would have gained much more Purpose than
this.
96416: I needed to be more specific about what I wanted to destroy in the
oasis.
96468: The logs were a formidable barrier to human invaders.
96688: The remains of the bulwark would eventually blow into the desert.
96772: If it were in my nature, I could have caused misery by creating more
sand.
96828: The box appeared plain, but it evoked a certain curiosity humans would
find nearly impossible to resist.
96964: Spirits of ill Will escaped the box even before I had finished opening
it.  They set upon me immediately, but soon realized they could not affect me. 
Thus they scattered, seeking to find those they might torment.

Destroying
often gained Purpose, but never as much as from the simple act I had done at
that moment.
97188: If there were malevolent spirits still remaining within, I wanted them
to have every opportunity to escape.
97264: Since human misery was my objective and destruction merely a means
toward that end, I would have gained more Purpose if the box were in tact.
97364: I could not see the mirror itself, just the limited and corresponding
perspectives of each side.
97430: I knew the mirror was inscribed with the name "Ageless."  More than one
summoner had asked me if looking into the mirror would grant them immortality. 
Each one's disappointment turned to my Purpose.
97610: On one side of her was part of a canopied bed, on the other was a closet
door.
97664: I saw nothing inside my mirror that wasnt part of the reflection.
97824: Interactions within depended on my Purpose.
97876: Moving the gates was beyond my Purpose at that time.
97920: Moving the road was beyond my Purpose at that time.
97960: Except for his beard, I saw nothing different about the guard.
98012: Finally suspecting magic as the cause of his partner's disappearance,
the remaining guard grabbed Sela before she could duplicate her trick.  The
mirror was dislodged from her hand and shattered against the ground.
98162: It was just a matter of time before the other guard noticed what had
happened.
98220: Except for his glasses, I saw nothing noteworthy about the guard.
98276: Finally suspecting magic as the cause of his partner's disappearance,
the remaining guard grabbed Sela before she could duplicate her trick.  The
mirror was dislodged from her hand and shattered against the ground.
98426: It was just a matter of time before the other guard noticed what had
happened.
98484: A description of nothing would have been difficult to render.
98528: The timeless word temporarily integrated me.
98560: The word that once integrated me was lost to the undercurrents.
98604: I remembered being in that vaulted area many times before.  Although it
was certainly possible that things had changed since the previous summoning.
98848: I could not remember being there.
98872: I had to rely on memories gained recently.
98904: Purpose had better uses than for talking needlessly.
98940: The circumstances were not exactly as they needed to be to grant a wish.
99404: I was not a servant who could fly.
99428: While I could not have done so, readers of these chronicles could have
consulted the walkthrough guide "Everything You Wanted To Know About Servants".
99776: I needed to give one of the answers above.
99884: "Oops" could only correct a single word.
99916: It was pitch dark, and I could not see a thing.
99952: To have repeated a command like "frog, jump", I should have just said
"again", not "frog, again".
100028: I could have hardly repeated that.
100052: I wanted to talk to someone, but I could not.
100088: To talk to someone, I should have just tried "talk to".
100132: The undercurrents of confusion made my commands meaningless.
100200: I did not understand that number, but used it anyway.
100240: I was not able to use multiple objects with that verb.
100280: I was able to use multiple objects only once on a line.
100352: I excepted something not included anyway.
100384: I could only do that to something animate.
100416: That was not an action my Purpose allowed.
100448: That was not something I needed to refer to in the course of my
Purpose.
100500: I did not understand the way that finished.
100532: There were none at all available.
100556: I could have only one item there. Which exactly?
100758: Was I sure I wanted to quit?
100790: Was I sure I wanted to restart?
100816: The game file was verified as intact.
100844: The game file did not verify as intact and may have been corrupted.
100892: My attempt to begin a transcript failed.
100920: My attempt to end transcript failed.
100948: At that moment, I was not channeling anything.
101012: There was no Purpose in doing that.
101040: I was carrying too many things already.
101068: Djinni notwithstanding, I could not put something on top of itself.
101116: I lacked the undercurrent dexterity.
101144: Djinni notwithstanding, I could not put something inside itself.
101192: That would scarcely have emptied anything.
101252: I could only get into something free-standing.
101288: But I was not in anything at the moment.
101344: I had to decide which compass direction to go in.
101380: was then in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gave long
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
101476: was then in its "verbose" mode, which always gave long descriptions of
locations (even if I had been there before).
101560: was then in its "superbrief" mode, which always gave short descriptions
of locations (even if I had not been there before).
101736: If I needed to answer, I [talked to "summoner"].
101780: There were reasons for not doing so.
101808: Nothing practical resulted from my prayer.
101840: While summoned, I was always awake.
101868: I searched the undercurrents for a good idea.
101900: I did not have the sense humans called smell.
101932: I did not have the sense humans called taste.
101964: I thought that would help, but I was mistaken.
102000: Digging would have achieved nothing there.
102032: I would have achieved nothing by this.
102060: Violence could expend much Purpose if not applied appropriately.
102108: There was nothing sensible to swing there.
102140: I had no hands and I needed to wave.
102168: I did not want to expend the Purpose necessary to do that.
102212: I did not want to expend the Purpose necessary to do that.
102256: That would have taken more Purpose than I would have cared to expend.
102308: At that moment, that was the best I could think of.
102348: That would have taken more Purpose than I would have cared to expend.
102400: That would have taken more Purpose than I would have cared to expend.
102452: I had no need for such activities.
