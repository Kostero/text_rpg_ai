20572: An Interactive Puzzle by Andrew Plotkin. Copyright 1989-2005.
20628: First-time players should type "about" and "credits".
20812: The Rules:
20822: Wander around. Puzzles will be posed. Eventually you win.
20872: Philosophy:
20882: Some games make their puzzles too dense, by packing too many puzzles
into the same sets of clues. Some make theirs too sparse, by putting in too
many red herrings. I have tried to achieve a balance, by doing both.
21036: Playing the Game:
21050: Type one of the highlighted words to go in a direction, examine an
object, or talk to a creature. You do not need to use Adventure-style commands
like "take sword" or "read parchment". A single word will work.

Type a
creature's name to begin speaking to it. (Merely naming its species is rarely
sufficient!) Creatures often ask questions, or pose riddles. When you are
speaking to a creature, you will see a double ">>" prompt. You can then type a
word or phrase to try to answer the riddle. If you are correct, you will be
rewarded.

(You can still move in directions, and examine objects, at the ">>"
prompt.)
21504: Special commands:
21672: Free hint:
21680: Don't make assumptions about what you're being asked.

The structure of
the planes (and the Plane of Structure) were snitched from Roger Zelazny's
22404: History:
23376: Possessions have no meaning here.
23400: Are you sure you want to restart?
23564: I'm afraid I don't know how to do that.
23620: You find yourself in a doorless room.
23676: There is no reply.
23704: This is the center, apparently. The planes of existence stretch out
around you; some open and beckoning, some blocked to your spirit. Most are
esoteric and of little importance to you, but you are drawn to several: the
physical, or
23896: .

This place seems to revolve around a multi-dimensional object, a
23956: which seems to continue through all the planes. Your sight cannot
penetrate it.
24012: Your perception cannot penetrate the monolith.
24044: You stand at the center of a grassy plain. The only feature in sight is
an immense rectangular
24120: , black and unreflective.

Paths lead away in the four cardinal
directions. To the
24252: Yep, it's big, black, and rectangular all right. You can probably guess
the proportions. You notice a piece of
24378: The sign is written in an ornate calligraphy, and bears four arrows,
pointing along the four paths.
24452: "There Here be Emblems, four in Number. A Mark Each Bears, Enigmatic and
Hidden; You may Discover Each by the Acrostic of Names Each Emblem Flaunts."
24570: You stand on a low hill, under skies suddenly gray and clouded. At the
crest, a wooden rod rises from the ground, twenty feet high and a foot thick.
Bolts of lightning continuously blast from the clouds and strike the rod; the
noise is deafening.

You see
24760: You read the words:
24926: The plains here are divided by a wide river, whose waters rush by with
immense power. The air is full of the sound of the torrent as it splashes among
the rocks.

Standing on the near bank is a silver chalice, as tall as a man.
Engraved on the sides are
25112: You read the words:
25262: The ground is dark and bare here, stripped by the constant roaring wind
that blows across this place.

A giant sword of glittering steel is embedded in
the ground, rising twice as high as your head. The hilt is ornately wrought,
and fine
25440: You read the words:
25454: Off with its head!

- I behead a flavorsome seed, and discover the
Way.
- I behead an illusion, and discover an illusionist.
- I behead a single
bird, and discover a mountain top.
- I behead a sick-house, and discover a
savour.
- I betail a shape, and discover a short distance.
- I betail a strip,
and discover a bone.
25692: You find yourself on the peak of a stony mountain. The lands below are
strangely obscured in mist. Balanced on the peak is a wide disk of some glowing
crystal.

You see
25816: You read the words:
26092: Carved around the rim of the disk are a row of small circles:
26636: You are standing on turf, but the land curves strangely. Hills rise at
odd angles, even curving out over empty air. Some features of terrain are
worse; looking up, for example, you notice a segment of the ground that seems
to have gotten stuck overhead, upside down, connected to a mound by a narrow
bridge of grassy soil.

The impression of weirdness is reinforced by the trees
and bushes that stick out of the ground here and there; they are perpendicular
to the grass, no matter what angle that means.

A neat path leads
27012: into a depression. A third leads
27038: onto a precariously projecting prong of a hill.

Poking out of the
ground is a rough stick with a
27124: "Their names are Hypborea, Alaseia, Iriphaea, and Loprasme."
27172: You are standing half-way up a mound. Gravity seems to have shifted, as
you're still standing perpendicular to the grass, even though it looked like a
60-degree angle before you started climbing.

The improved view makes this
place worse; the ground in the distance is as likely to be above the "horizon"
as below it; and in either case, daylight could be showing through gaps
underneath. Everything is covered with neatly-cropped grass, though.

A path
goes
27532: it.

A tawny sphinx lies by the path. Its dark eyes follow you silently,
but it remains otherwise motionless.
28450: E. So what is the shape of the figure OSRHP, and what is its area in
square bloits?" It smiles gently and curls up again.
28540: "Both the shape and the area, please."
28572: The sphinx shakes his head slowly.
28596: The sphinx blinks slowly, displaying perhaps the faintest sign of
surprise at your answer. "The serpent's name is Proealms, but you must unlock
it."
28702: You are standing in a depression in the crest of a hill. You note with
some unease that another hill arches overhead, and the hill you are on is
considerably longer on one side than on the other.

A narrow path leads
28868: .

Grazing in the depression is a black unicorn, its silver horn
gleaming even in the diffuse sunlight. It watches you curiously, and without
fear.
28972: "What form lies hidden in the Sphinx's riddle?" the unicorn asks. "Tell
me that, and perhaps I'll help you."
29056: The unicorn shakes its head and snorts into its beard.
29096: The unicorn nods. "I know the name of the pegasus. Start at the number
of my race; then follow the Way of Water, then Air, then Water, then Earth,
then Water thrice more."
29224: This is a narrow hill-side. Really narrow, in fact; the hill is barely
more than ten feet wide. The laws of gravity seem to be in bad shape, as you're
standing straight out from the side of the hill.

The path continues
29388: the hill towards the top, which seems strangely elongated. You could
also go back
29452: .

A white pegasus is perched here, cropping the grass and apparently
unconcerned about the precariousness of the situation.
29540: The creature intones, "My grandmother has four; my father has three; my
name has two; you, only one. To what am I referring?" It looks at you
expectantly.
29668: The pegasus winks conspiratorially and says, "The last name of the Norn
is hidden in the clues of the Literal Plane. The first name is Fyreen. Tell the
whole to Typhon -- once you know Typhon's name, that is!"
29822: This is a grassy slope at the edge of a precipitous drop. Peering
cautiously over the edge, you see blue sky below.

A small path leads
29964: A passel of nymphs are clustered by the precipice, apparently paying no
attention to the danger. There are four of them; a sylph, a dryad, a naiad, and
an oread.
30080: The sylph asks, "Answer me this: what is the Way as Air?"
30124: The sylph shakes her head, her eyes twinkling.
30160: The sylph says, "The sphinx's name is Arlumere."
30200: The dryad asks, "Tell me the name of the Way as Fire."
30244: The dryad shakes her head, her eyes twinkling.
30280: The dryad looks up and says, "The griffon is called Adracaston."
30328: The naiad asks, "First, tell me the name of the Way as Water."
30376: The naiad shakes her head, her eyes twinkling.
30412: The naiad smiles at you and murmurs, "The name of the unicorn is
Aelacimos."
30468: The oread asks, "What is the Way as Earth?"
30504: The oread shakes her head, her eyes twinkling.
30540: The oread smiles. "The Plane of Structure is already open to you."
30590: The oread looks at you, glances at the other three maidens, and nods.
"The way to the Plane of Structure will be opened to you."
30688: You feel a faint silvery sensation impinge on your soul.
30728: This area is quite flat, which would be comforting if it were inclined
less than 45 degrees. As usual, you are angled to match. Hills rise all about
you.

A path leads
30888: an amphitheatre-like cavity cut into the side of another.

Resting near
here is a large golden griffon. It looks somnolent, but its alertness is
betrayed by a piercing blue eye peering from beneath a half-closed lid.
31040: The griffon looks at you down its hooked beak. "Try this one: I am
forever on the Way, but I will never reach its end. I see the Way in three
aspects. With my first eye, I see it as endless motion; with my other eye, I
see it as eternal stasis. Yet I have a third eye, which sees both without
contradiction; perceiving entropy, the energy of the Way decaying inevitably
down to silence. What am I?"
31332: "Nope," the griffon says.
31352: The griffon ruffles its wings and says, "The name of my cousin the
hippogryph is 3, 6, 1, 12, 4, 5, 2, 8."
31438: You're standing on a spit of grassy soil that projects out over a cliff.
It narrows further ahead, becoming a mere bridge that twists horrifyingly up
into the air.

The path follows it
31576: into space, even where the bridge is barely wider than the path. A
safer-looking path leads back
31652: to the other side.

A hippogryph balances nervously on the spit, its
wings half-spread and waving slightly to maintain balance. It seems oblivious
of you.
31764: The beast looks over and snaps, "The key to the snake's name is
west-south-east-south. Now go away!"
32118: the knob. From your perspective, of course, it leads straight down along
the side of the spire.

A Typhon, a giant serpent with the head of a human, is
tangled unconcernedly on one side of the knob. It looks up at you lazily, and
you note with some nervousness that the human head has retained the fangs of
the serpent.
32344: The beast grins at you, and begins absent-mindedly sharpening its fangs
on a stone.
32404: That apparently doesn't interest the Typhon.
32436: "Well done, mortal; perhaps the human race has some wit about it after
all. I will open the Plane of Essence to your passage. We will see how you
confront the Monolith."
32564: You feel a faint silvery sensation impinge on your soul.
32604: A plane of existence stretches out below you. You feel drawn to it, but
at the same time blocked; your spirit cannot pass into it without aid.
32704: Floating in space here is a colorless sphere. Within it you see the
letter
32756: The object here is lens-shaped, convex on both sides, with a sharp rim.
Inside it you see the letter
32828: A cylinder, as wide as it is high, drifts nearby. It contains the letter
32916: Here you you see a pyramid -- the square-based type. Inside is the
letter
33004: Floating nearby you see an octahedron. Within it is the letter
33048: Here you see, in all its glory, a dodecahedron. Inside it is the letter
33100: A plane of existence stretches out below you. You feel drawn to it, but
at the same time blocked; your spirit cannot pass into it without aid.
33200: The omnipresent monolith has not failed you -- its essence is clearly
visible in this plane. However, from this perspective, it is no longer
impenetrable! An
33388: . The center of the darkness has a strange
33424: The monolith distorts oddly as you approach; as you pass through its
surface, you are totally enveloped in blackness.
33508: A red glow appears before you; it is bright, but illuminates nothing in
the darkness around you. From it, a crackling voice says, "Speak the Mark of
Fire."
33624: A blue glow appears. A soft voice asks, "What is the Mark of Water?"
33676: A yellow glow waxes before you, and a voice breathes, "What is the Mark
of Air?"
33736: A green glow appears, and from it a ponderous voice intones, "Speak now
the Mark of Earth."
33948: You are in a square room. The floor and ceiling are grey slate, but the
walls are various colors:
34060: The monolith twists out of existence as you feel the familiar sensation
of planar travel. A deep voice intones, "You win." A thousand-piece
brass-and-kazoo band strikes up a congratulatory hymn, and a crowd of cheering
elementals carries you off to Valhalla for a well-earned nap.
