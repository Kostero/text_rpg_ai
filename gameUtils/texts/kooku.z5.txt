out a dented metal desk. The only exit from the clutter is to the east.
55736: Among the papers you recognize code snippets from the cancelbot you were

and URL's.
55848: It's best to leave the papers be.
55984: It's best to leave the manuals be.

57512: This short hall in the Computer Center continues to the south. Your
office is to the west. There is a heavy door to the north, protected with a
card reader. There is a sign above the north door.
57652: Computer Room: Authorized Personnel Only!
57684: The card reader has a small slot, just about the size of a USENET Cabal
membership card.
57752: The computer room door unlocks with a loud clunk.
57788: The computer room door has been scarred by the fingernails of frustrated
users.
57844: The door to the computer room is closed.

57900: Kook U's main computer room, where you spend much too much of your time,
is cooled by a massive air conditioning system. All manner of electronic
equipment beeps and flickers. Thankfully the janitorial staff has cleaned up
the most recent electrical fire. The exit is to the south.
58096: You don't need to refer to that in order to complete this game.
58160: ENET news server, usually extremely active, seems oddly silent. Oh no,
is the network down again?
58736: This is Kook U's central network router, responsible for directing most
of the network traffic for the entire campus. Being such a crucial piece of
equipment it is essential that the router be 100% operational at all times.
58896: As you switch on the router, the level of activity in the computer room
increases noticeably. After a few seconds you hear the distant cheers of users
everywhere. The network is up again!
59028: The router is off again, the network is down again.
59064: This is the south end of a short hall in the Computer Center. There is
an office to the east and the main terminal room is to the south.
59160: Much more organized than your own, this is the office of Martin, one of
your colleagues. The exit is to the west.
59246: Grubana - By Martin Hannigan
Original "Copa Cabana"  - By Barry
Manilow

His name was Boursy, he was a showoff
With yellow feathers in his hair
and his rent way up there
He would merengue and do the cha-cha
But while he
tried to be a star,
Grubor always tended bar
Across the crowded room, he posts
from 8 til 4
They were young and they had each other
Who could ask for
more?

At the Copa (CO!), CopaGrubana (CopaGrubana)
The hottest spot north of
MAE-East-ana (here)
At the Copa (CO!), CopaGrubana
Usenet and passion were
always in fashion
At the Copa....they fell in love.

His name was Rico. He
wrote a FAQ list
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Boursy dancing there
And
when he finished, he called him over,
But Rico went a bit to far,
Grubor sailed
across the bar
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two
There
was blood and a single gun shot
But just who shot who?

At the Copa (CO!),
CopaGrubana (CopaGrubana)
The hottest spot north of MAE-East-ana (here)
At the
Copa (CO!), CopaGrubana
Usenet and passion were always in fashion
At the
Copa....he lost his love.

Copa... CopaGrubana... Usenet and passion... always
the fashion...

Her name was Boursy, he was a showgirl,
But that was 30 years
ago, when they used to have a show.
Now it's a disco, but not for Boursy,
Still
in the dress he used to wear,
Faded feathers in his hair.
He sits there so
refined, and smokes himself half-blind.
He lost his youth and he lost his
Grubor,
Now he's lost his mind!

At the Copa (CO!), CopaGrubana
(CopaGrubana)
The hottest spot north of MAE-East-ana (here)
At the Copa (CO!),
CopaGrubana
Usenet and passion were always in fashion
At the Copa....don't fall
in love.
60560: Martin's screen is blank. The network must be down again!
63156: The main terminal room of Kook U's College of Computer Science is filled
with terminals, personal computers, workstations and other computing equipment,
all being used by university students and faculty. A small hall leads north and
the building's exit is to the south.
63348: The users, angry that the network is still down, refuse to permit you,
the Network Administrator, to leave the building.
63436: The computing equipment is being used by someone else. Besides, you have
your own terminal back in your office.
63516: The users are all busy with their work.
63544: The users look as if they're ready to tar and feather you.
63588: The users have better things to do.
63616: You are standing at the entrance to the College of Computer Science,
which lies to the north. Pleasant paths also lead east and west to other
buildings, and south to the main commons.
63762: commons area is a welcome refuge from the stresses often found in the
surrounding buildings. The lawn is spotted with gently swaying trees and
shrubbery. Paths lead off in all directions.
63892: You don't need to refer to that in order to complete this game.
63936: You are just oustide Kook U's Loan Office, where students can obtain
information on, and often quarrel about, their student loans. The building's
entrance is to the northwest. Paths also lead east, southeast and south.
64092: The electric fan, which you cleverly switched on earlier, does a fine
job clearing the smoke-filled air in the Loan Office, making breathing just
barely tolerable.
64208: You attempt to enter the Loan Office, but the air inside is so thick
with cigarette smoke that you must return, coughing and hacking, to the
outdoors.
64316: It must be lunch time in this, Kook U's student loan office, since all
the teller's windows are vacant. The exit is to the southeast.
64412: You don't need to refer to that in order to complete this game.

>Boursy is incorrectly correcting his own correct
statements.
>No more I need see.  Take the loco weed away from
him--NOW.
>Before he hurts himself.

Actually it's not the locoweed--it's just
not
enough coffee--can't function much until the 3rd cup.
I even drink it right
before sleeping--a true addict--
I only notice it when I don't drink it.
64868: The Thermos has the word "MEOW" emblazened boldly across its surface.
The thermos is currently
64940: You have nothing to pour the coffee into.
64972: The coffee's aroma is reminiscent of the finest blends available from
Cafe Algiers in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
65052: The coffee's aroma is reminiscent of the finest blends available from
Cafe Algiers in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
65132: Stephen Boursy is here, typing at the office's only computer terminal.
65184: The years have not been kind to Stephen Boursy. Steve is in his late
forties. His smoking problem has kept him thin, however. His eyes are sad, his
face is somewhat gnarled, and his gray hair is cut short. He must have arms,
since he is typing, yet you don't seem to be able to actually see them.
65396: Steve dodges your attack and admonishes "Stop trying to censor me with
violence, you cabal apologist!"
65468: Steve looks up from his terminal briefly, coughs, then goes back to
typing.
65524: Ew! Not even his own wife wants to do that!
65596: For a moment Steve looks excited at the prospect of joining the Cabal.
65648: Steve looks with disdain upon Martin's lyrics.
65682: Steve eagerly gulps the fine coffee. For a moment he appears to relax.
Suddenly, however, he stands, clutches his chest, and collapses to the floor
with a thin gasp. His corpse disappears in a cloud of cigarette smoke.
65840: Steve appears to be more interested in what he's typing.
65880: Boursy trembles slightly at the sight of the Dean's name.
65924: For a moment Steve looks excited at the prospect of joining the Cabal.
65976: Steve looks with disdain upon Martin's lyrics.
66012: Steve admires the coffee with envy. Smacking his lips, he stammers "The
cafeteria is fresh out you know."
66088: Steve appears to be more interested in what he's typing.
66128: "Just another Cabal forger and theif [sic]."
66168: Boursy trembles slightly at the mention of the Dean's name.
66212: "Drink it constantly. The cafeteria is fresh out you know."
66256: "I'll probably die sooner, but I certainly enjoy them."
66300: "<ahem> Haven't smoked the stuff in years."
66336: "Miss April makes my pecker hard."
66364: "John is my best friend. He wants me to have sex with my daughter the
horny teen you know."
66432: "A fine Freedom Knught you know."
66644: ever loses it's spine I'll put it up at AOL and take it to the Ma.
Attorney Generals Office and the Mass. ACLU if there are any problems with
AOL."
66760: "These censors repel me--but I'll tell you--even more disgusting are the
sys admins that bend to them-- they have not one shred of decency in them."
67268: "The very next ISP in Massachusetts that pulls a users plug based on
usenet content will be held fully accountable for their entire feed--including
their porn and warez files and the proper authorities and public interest
groups will be take on a guilded tour until they are closed down and lose
everything."
67664: Steve appears to be more interested in what he's typing.
67704: Marlboro, of course. Steve's in a hurry for the big C.
67746: Steve jumps up to stop you from snatching his beloved smokes. Suddenly
he freezes, clutches his chest, and falls to the ground with a thin gasp. With
a quiet "poof!" his corpse disappears into a cloud of cigarette smoke.
67904: Seems to be the finest Acapulco gold. Harvested early in the season,
before the rains. Poignant, but not overbearing. Not that you would know
anything about this sort of thing.
68052: Arboretum, or "arb", as it's known, lies to the northeast. Other paths
lead west, southwest and south.
68128: All manner of trees and shrubs surround you in the arb, making this an
extremely pleasant place on campus. The arb's exit is to the southwest.
68228: The varied vegetation in the arb is calming to the spirit.
68470: mdrugs

I want to say more about my history with legal and illegal
drugs. I found that with marijuana smokers some of them were more intelligent
than the normal beer drinking crowd of North Carolinians.  So I liked being
around pot smokers, not all of them, but the ones who would smoke and get into
philosophic discussions.  There were other Mary Jane smokers who would just
talk drug talk about the quality of this pot or that pot. I didn't enjoy that
talk at all.

At one time in college, I was a pot head.  There are times when I
think that I should stop smoking pot all together.  But a little now and then
helps me to cope with the stark reality of capitalism. The euphoria of pot some
times helps me see ways out of the cruel reality.
68992: Doctress Neutopia is here, dancing naked among the trees.
69036: While not a young woman anymore, the Doctress is not unattractive. She's
thin with long, dark hair and a far away look in her eyes.
69132: "Get away from me! What are you, a Monster Truck Neutopian?"
69180: The Doctress regards you invitingly for a moment, but then decides
you're not Gaia Messiah material. "The Queen Bee isn't in the right mood for a
massgasm right now," she declares.
69312: "Thank you. I couldn't live without my connection to the global network
of love."
69372: "This "Martin" person does not seem to be capable of universal love."
69424: "No thank you, I had to give them up years ago."
69460: The Doctress takes the joint gingerly and ponders it momentarily. With a
shrug, she inhales a long draw, holds it for at least a minute, and exhales
with a smile. As she mumbles of arcologies, massgasms, and lovolution, a cloud
of smoke billows around her. She reclines and is lifted off into the distance,
presumably to the Neutopian world she seeks.
69708: The Doctress seems pre-occupied with thoughts of her Neutopian vision.
69760: "A symbol of the oppressive patriarchy."
69852: "This "Martin" person does not seem to be capable of universal love."
69904: "No thank you, I had to give them up years ago."
69994: The euphoria of pot sometimes helps me see ways out of the cruel
reality."
70048: The Doctress seems pre-occupied with thoughts of her Neutopian vision.
70154: The euphoria of pot sometimes helps me see ways out of the cruel
reality."
70268: "He's only interested in looking at my tits."
70304: "Karl does not share my Lovolutionary insight. He in not capable of
global love. He has been brainwashed by the patriarchy."
70396: "A good lay but not capable of the eternal love I require of a soulmate
and Gaia Messiah."
70464: "My mission here is to herald in a Neu Age of love, peace, ecofeminism,
communalism, solar energy, the end of poverty, and a planetary network of
arcologies."
70580: "To accomplish the Great Work of re-ordering the world to reflect the
God/dess within, we will need everyone's sincere dedication to the Crone's
Wisdom and the Neutopia society S/he envisions."
70720: "Neutopia is a millennium movement. Isn't it time, friends and lovers,
that we come together? Please join me in this multi-dimensional reality."
70824: "We shall move beyond the injustices of worldwide Greco-Christian
dominance and global capitalism if we but dream and participate in the
collective miracle of Neutopian evolution! Yes, the massgasm is about to
climax!"
70980: "Please join me in helping to create this Neutopian dream of planetary
harmony."
71040: The Doctress seems pre-occupied with thoughts of her Neutopian vision.
71092: The Doctress glances your way with a brief, bright smile and goes back
to her revelry.
71152: "The Queen Bee does not take orders from her beloved subjects."
71200: The noble entrance to Kook U's esteemed College of Law is directly to
the west. Other paths lead north, east and south.
71312: Shelves and shelves of legal tomes fill this, the massive law library of
Kook U. Shafts of light illuminate the dust motes suspended in the air of this
dimly lit hall. The exit from the College is to the east and a small corridor
leads north.
71480: The shelves are full of a variety of legal reference books.
71524: You don't need to refer to that in order to complete this game.
71568: You recognize this as a copy of H.R. 1748, "The Netizens Protection Act
of 1997," also known as the "Smith Bill." This is a legal document that would,
among other things, impose severe penalties for sending Unsolicited Commercial
Email (UCE). The document also includes an email address to obtain more
information: comments@cauce.org.
71824: Filled with quaint wooden desks, this study hall is used by law students
to research important legal issues. A corridor leads south.
71916: You see nothing special about the desks.
71944: John Grubor sits at one of the desks, working at a computer terminal.
72046: 6", has stringy dark hair and an angry face. But by far his most
startling feature is his enormous eyebrows.
72124: John throws a weak punch in retaliation, but his age and health prevent
him landing anything substantial.
72196: John massages his buttocks, as if recalling an unpleasant memory.
"Sorry, jerkoff, but that's reserved for Bubba."
72280: "That guy is a suspected pedophile."
72308: "I invented the friggin' Internet asswipe."
72344: "I'll OWN the goddam Cabal soon, moron."
72380: "Mister Boursy told me that fucker was a pedophile. By the way, have you
seen Boursy's daughter around anywhere?
72462: Grubor pops the joint into his mouth, chews, and swallows. "Strictly for
medical purposes, boy."
72536: John spends a few minutes reading the article. (He's not exactly an
Evelyn Wood graduate.) Wiping away tears, John sobs wildly "It's true, it's
true! I don't deserve to live." John produces a revolver and, before you can
react, lifts it to his temple and fires. He falls limply to the ground and
utters his last words: "This is the Law Systems Institute...Out." As you stand
horrified, the campus janitorial staff arrives, swiftly removes the mess, and
departs.
72876: "You anti-UCE jerks are all pedophiles."
72908: John seems more interested in what he's typing.
72944: "That guy is a suspected pedophile."
72972: "I invented the friggin' Internet asswipe."
73008: "I'll OWN the goddam Cabal soon, moron."
73044: "Mister Boursy told me that fucker was a pedophile. By the way, have you
seen Boursy's daughter around anywhere?"
73128: Grubor snatches at the joint and growls "Give me that or I'll sue, you
child molestor!"
73192: John spends a few minutes reading the article. (He's not exactly an
Evelyn Wood graduate.) Wiping away tears, John sobs wildly "It's true, it's
true! I don't deserve to live." John produces a revolver and, before you can
react, lifts it to his temple and fires. He falls limply to the ground and
utters his last words: "This is the Law Systems Institute...Out." As you stand
horrified, the campus janitorial staff arrives, swiftly removes the mess, and
departs.
73532: "You anti-UCE jerks are all pedophiles."
73564: John seems more interested in what he's typing.
73600: "That's another Cabal pedophile."
73628: John trembles slightly at the mention of the Dean's name.
73672: "I only use it for medical purposes."
73700: "Mister Boursy tells me she has nice breasts."
73736: "Mister Boursy is the Master of USENET. By the way, have you seen his
daughter around?."
73808: "You anti-UCE jerks are all pedophiles."
73840: "The forces of good, Boursy & Grubor & Allisat and Gonzales, will
conquer the evil cabal system in due time."
73924: "News administrators do what the USERS say, regardless of the stress on

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

A disbarred
Butler County attorney who admitted stealing $28,000 from a client was
sentenced to up to 23 months in prison Wednesday by an Allegheny County Common
Pleas Court judge.

John Grubor, 36, of Butler, broke down and cried after
Judge Robert E. Dauer imposed the 11 -to-23-month prison term to be served at
the state Correctional Institution at Greensburg, Westmoreland County.

The
judge also ordered that Grubor spend five years on probation after completing
the prison sentence.

Grubor pleaded guilty last month to one count of theft by
failure to make required dispostion of funds entrusted to him. He admitted he
bilked a client out of $28,000 in a workmen's compensation settlement.

The
state Supreme Court disbarred Grubor as a result of the theft.

Subject: I <heart> You

Dearest April,

How I long to see you
again. There is nothing I like more than seeing your cheeks stuffed with my
love sausage. Do you mind if I post the pictures we took to USENET?

Perhaps
this weekend we could go to the Colorado Club (one of my favorite "gentleman's
clubs" -- they know me there) together.

Don't worry yourself too much about
what happened last night. I'm certain your Ukrainian hubby didn't see me slip
out the bedroom window.

Yours forever
Al McAnespy
76936: Miss April is here, typing at one of the library's computer terminals.
76988: Miss April seems to be about forty and somewhat short of stature. If one
had to pick a single word to describe her overall appearance, it would be
"dizzy".
77100: As much as you'd like to, you decide against attacking poor Miss April.
77152: You plant a little kiss on Miss April's cheek. She wipes it off and
pushes you away with a giggle.
77278: "Internet terminal

so everyone
can read my poem"

is a big stalker
I'll still hate him
When I'm old in

77678: "You think I'm married
But it's just talk
If you try to find out
I'll

77746: "I don't know anything about that. Would you like to hear one of my
poems?
78372: Sometimes i feel
like baby bird
tip tapping on a shell

slimed in the
muck
from others' thoughts
I fed and wish them well

breakthrough I'm
free
sweet slime, cloak me
until I beat my wings

in time I'm dry
sustained, I
fly
come hear my true voice sing.

78566: Jealous Lover

His thoughts churned
imagined
their sex
with me
his
fantasy
slithered
beyond reason
retching ill
I hemmed in
please, not again
too
late
his snakes were mating
as I stood clear
begged him to stop
sickened with
fear
blameless blamed
he aimed at me
imagined my recoil
I stood
as he
fanged
fantasy guilt
disgusted
at him.

April"
78820: A Night in Confession

My eyes smile sweet anger
Luring you past the
pulpit
Pressing over you
Swallowing you in

Your eyes close begging
Escaping
the coldness
My judgement 
Watches over you

Your denial flys open
I still
myself 
Keeping your gaze
You shutter your soul

I dangle your release

Gripping, fluid, rhythm, again
Now    halt   between
Beads of your
penance

Motionless, shuddering
My quick darting sin
A deliverance, your
puzzle
You squirm envious in prayer

Till my answer crashes, now
faster
Chanting, singing, calling  benediction
I evoke exalting streams,
quiver
Hush   rest   now   
in forgiveness.

79284: I Test Drove a Volvo Today

Today I drove a Volvo
Black and
nondescript
I was feeling quite benign
Until I saw the stick

Confident and
yearning
I pet ignition fur
Stroked the gears to churning
Bold shifts to make
it purr

We sprung to pounce on asphalt
Heart leap at every curve
Growling
pause at stop signs
To ease sweet rider's nerve

Stalk, shift back to the
dealer
We felt so prime and fit
Addressing now my pale one
"I think, I want,
buy it!"

April"
79626: ADD

Sometimes I am like a child
when you speak long
I see your point
as
you spell out the details
forever it takes
I am somewhere else
now thinking 
of
how I wish you'd speak
in a commercial moment

Arrgggghh!  Just spit it out
already!

Sometimes I listen long
as you skip from tale to tale
they all tie in
together
a yarn of commercial moments

Thank you!  I could listen
forever!

79918: Motorcycle thoughts

Driving on high ground
my Mountaineer, safe and
sound
as freon crisp air
caresses my hair
I nod 

Shelled glass seeing
danger
bike on the side
a frightened young wife with
twisted metal thoughts
hung her
man
a for sale sign

Stolen cycle dreamin'
I'm renting the road
petal pink
dress ripping
sweat sleek and low
bucking under
yellow frilled panties
wind
trap hair
encrusted bug fleece 
as I'm whizzing by
blurred passerby
I snore

I
don't need that young wife's fear
I only need to dream it here.

80304: The Down Feather

Sanding in your circle
My wings tucked in splints
My
mind gropes with hindsight
Resounds in the present

Your theme is easy to
pick
I see your record skip
all so easy now

Shadowed by threats
My heart has
grown cold now
My mind turns it over
Keeps faint hearts beating

Wings have
grown itchy
From hiding their glimmer
Your thumb is still pressing
Charade is
the under

April"
80594: Mind has gone jittery
imagining the split
of lifetimes and promises
all
under the bridge
it's gone on too long now
the spell that I'm under
feeling a
need now
to reach it I wonder

A way, what way, I know the way
It's taking too
long
Just day by day

Suffering affections
in returns half-hearted
All to
consider
A name lost in credit
I know your financials
The payment is
slowly
hocked in a gold band
my priceless not finding

I wear scarlet "I" on my
chest
while you search for a tag 
to cover me in dress

April"
80972: Unrequited Moments

For a moment
You breathed a question
That brought a
stab of longing
To a resolute heart

For a moment
I turned to you
Gave a gentle
puff
For your floundering ego

For a moment
You needed my
contemplation
Stretched all your being
For my consideration

For a moment
I
turned indecisive
Wishing for only
More of such moments

For few moments
Bear
no sustenance
Gentle puffs I give
Never come back to me.

Away you dance
Filled
with a light I'd given
And I sit as always
In the darkness you've left for
me.

April"
81370: Sewing Circle

He spoke in a seam
of red flowing thread
stitching the
petals
of embroidered love

I listened in green
of pinpricked stemms
poking the
thorns
through naked canvas

We waited between
empty spools of thread
clumsy
thimble thumb find
a white color for life.

81574: untitled

Yes, it's pouring cold rain.  Nothing warm or sultry about it.
 And I had an umbrella, a way to protect us.  But your ego in a flash of white
blinding light, cut through my advice and left it to be swallowed in a rapidly
growing puddle.  And you sleep through your mistake as I'm drowning in this
pool of fear.  Fear from being forced to live with your lies, your rash
reasonings, your jealousy, your control, your threats. Too often you sought to
tie my hands, gag my mouth, and I can only wish for the way it was when I was
alone.  There are no ties of love anymore, no security of that warm gentle
inspiration to keep me going in the stormiest circumstance.  My every instinct
is shouting to me, "run while you can!"  But you've left me without the means
anymore.  Crippled emotionally, financially, I begin to think of things I knew
I never would.  But I never knew I'd be in a situation like this.  Chapter 13
begins to look more and more like the doorstep I'll darken, as I think of
stretching my already-stretched-with your-debt charge card to pay a lawyer's
fee.  Two fees, maybe.  

It had to all be in my name, didn't it?

The ad in
the paper says desperate seller, everyone knows what that means.  Except you. 
I'm trying hard now, to push back these fears, but you've left me with nothing
to fall on.  Not even you.  In the silent despair of threats overshadowing,  I
can think of no way except one, "Run, run while you can."
 
April"
82616: Untitled

You saw me as an Angel, a slight swish touch to make you
smile.
I prayed you were my saviour, built you, made you strong.
Your strength
heralded rash decisions.  My caution could not withstand.
And through it all I
see your weakness.  My advice, ignored, how can I
remain strong?  When all you
do to build us up shakes me to the core?
Should I remain to fall into the pit
with you?  
A rainy day, I had an umbrella, you threw it away.  Now like an
anxious
mother, all births still, I remain infertile.  I just can't seem
to
produce any more, except these words of anguish.  
How can I hope to
conceive new life, when I feel you drag me down?  In
truth, I felt more
confident to be a mother when I was all alone.
You've tied me, to leave now I
cannot sustain even myself.  But to stay,
worried, I fear I would eat my
young.
Anxious now, untrusting of your unstable strength,
I cannot conceive, I
cannot receive, 
just dry and barren womb.

April"
83314: His stifling words
Pushed me to run
No limit in mind
Only
emptiness.

Kinda like a floundering fly in a bowl of pea soup
Every instinct
crying "Danger!"
As his needle stuck legs sink further in the green
muck.

83816: The air is filled with the type of angst-ridden sophomoric tripe
preferred by many of today's spoiled Generation X'ers. After a few songs the
tape ends and the player switches off.
83944: The tape is awfully noisy, but you can make out parts of it: "...Do you,
April...take this man...to be your lawfully wedded husband?... I do...You may
kiss the bride..."
84078: April's eyes open wide as you play the tape, and her face begins to
assume an expression of terror. As the recording ends, she blurts in
anguish,

"All right! Okay! I'll leave you alone
I don't understand how can
this be
But please don't tell my husband at home
About my boyfriend Al
McAnespy!"

With that, she darts out the door.
84324: The tape ends and the player switches off.
84356: Nothing happens, probably because there's no tape in the tape player.

little desk, his feet, which resemble hooves, dangle well above the floor. His
thin goatee seems out of place on such a youngster.

86408: At the sound of his own name Al "Implant" McAnespy stands rigid and
focuses a terrified gaze in your direction. With a mind-numbing scream Al
begins to shrink even smaller than he already is. His shriek rises in pitch as
he decreases in height to barely an inch.
