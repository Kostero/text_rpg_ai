77250: *** WELCOME TO THE ROBODUDE INTERFACE ***

You will be updated to the
Main Robodude Computer in: YOU WILL NEVER BE UPDATED

Incoming message: Listen
kid, whether you can hear this or not, I don't know. Nor do I care. You've
failed as a Robodude unit. The kids won't play with you. So you're useless. And
you know what a useless Robodude becomes, don't you?
77568: VISUAL REPORT: This seems to be a cleared area within the huge mounds of
scrap metal where the new roboduds are thrown into. The scrap metal mounds
continue to the north while to the east a "settlement" of broken roboduds has
formed.
77736: Massive walls of discarded roboduds prevent your passage.
77776: The scrap metal here has a rusted, dilapitated look to it. Because the
metal used in RoboDudes is easily malleable, most of it is in sheets. It
surrounds you in huge piles which prevent you from seeing the outside world...
if such a thing exists.
77952: The door looks impossible to penetrate, but there is a tiny opening at
the left side of it which looks like a keyhole.
78036: The northeast passage is blocked by a huge iron door.
78076: There is a passage to the northeast where a door once stood.
78120: VISUAL REPORT: The scrap metal has been piled into a large mountainous
structure. Bits and pieces of discarded roboduds lie scattered across the area.
You swear you can hear the electronic wane of discarded roboduds amidst the
metal.
78288: Massive walls of discarded roboduds prevent your passage.
78328: The mountain stretches as far as your visual units can detect; it seems
majestic in a hopeless sort of way. As you look only halfway up the mountain
you see corpses of roboduds who have tried to climb the mountain--and have
failed.
78488: ITEM REPORT: A discarded RoboDude pamphlet lies amidst the dirt.
78940: VISUAL REPORT: An entrance to the dilapidated village faces you now. The
architecture seems vaguely similar to that of the Old West, except with
metallic alloy buildings instead of wood ones. The difference is minute.
79100: The entrance says, in shakily written letters, "Rusty Robot Repository".
79156: The buildings are poorly constructed; some have fallen over while others
have burn marks on them, for some unknown reason.
79244: VISUAL REPORT: He seems to be the Viking model of RoboDudes, with what
seems to be an axe attached to one arm. He is sitting on a rocking chair, but
he is missing both his legs.
79380: Scruffy the robodud sits here on a porch.
79412: "Scruffy was beaten by one of them fact'ry workers. I surpose it was
because of Scruffy's stubborness. Oh well. Scruffy will die the way Scruffy
lived." He looks at you remorsefully.
79544: "Scruffy thinks you don't seem too bad. But Scruffy cannot surmise why
you are here, howsever."
79616: "Scruffy were am supposed to be a Viking RoboDude. Howsever Scruffy did
not appreciate that career change. That's prob'ly why..." He looks away.
79724: "This were am all the roboduds used to live. Then, they all started
dyin'. Seems that Scruffy's the only robodud remainin' here. But Scruffy cannot
leave on account of Scruffy's debilitatin' condition."
79872: "Scruffy were supposed to be a Viking RoboDude. But Scruffy could not
pronounce the word fjord. But Scruffy still has the optional Warrior Axe
attachment. Scruffy spends his time all day sharpenin' it.
80020: "Scruffy has watched many roboduds try for years to penetrate that there
door. Rumour has it it leads to an underground tunnel which leads to that them
fact'ry. There's another rumour that Scruffy heard. It states that there is an
object that serves as a key somewhere in the junkyard. Scruffy advises against
searching for it." He looks around hastily.
80268: "Scruffy do not care for outsider stories."
80300: "Scruffy did not request that most foul action. Don't do it again,"
Scruffy scowls.
80364: "Scruffy likes them shiny things."
80392: "Scruffy can not move on account of Scruffy's unusable legs, remember?"
80444: "Scruffy do not understand what yer talkin' 'bout."
80484: "Ahh, Scruffy don't like your backtalk."
80516: VISUAL REPORT: It looks like the roboduds had formed a civilization
within the walls of their broken comrades, but something happened-- eerie
silence surrounds you now. The buildings are all boarded up--except for one to
the north.
80688: The buildings are all boarded up, preventing your passage.
80990: There was an.."

It's too late. Junior has died.
81032: VISUAL REPORT: This tavern is in extremely poor condition, with broken
glass everywhere, as well as broken robots and burn marks. The lingering smell
of alcohol and fire leaves a pungent smell in your smell receptacle.
81192: The glass is everywhere; from windows, bottles, robots-- you name it,
it's on the ground.
81260: Junior lies here, cracked and broken.
81288: Junior lies here, still warm to the touch. His circuits and wiring are
visible through his wounds. His legs looks like they were partially chopped
off.
81440: You sneakily enter the factory, where you hear two humans with lab coats
talking. "I can't believe he claimed five men! How'd he get the mentality to do
that?" the first one says.

"Your guess is as good as mine. All the programming
was sound, it just seemed to be sociopathic and violent. It's truly biza-- what
the hell? There he is! That's the one!!" Both men whip towards you and stare
you down.

You feel it. The same feeling from before. But before you can act on
it, Scruffy and two security guards step forward. Scruffy says, in clean
English, "That's the one. Take him out." You glare at Scruffy in a fit of rage
just as the security guards raise their guns...
