    It is the year 2753.  You are engaged in a contest, a
race across the galaxy to acquire the Toaster of Battle Creek Michigan (the
last functioning toaster in the known universe, and therefore extremely
valuable.)

    You like to win.  To ensure your success in this competition,
you sabotaged the starships of the other participants.  Now you alone (or at
least you and your faithful assistant Walter) have discovered the cavern of the
Toaster.  Gloatingly, you ordered Walter to lower you into the cave...

    But
your rope snapped, and now you're trapped here - perhaps forever...
45413: You eventually fall into a pit.
45826: " in the version listing.  I've found them quite useful, and I'm sure
you would too.
46160: " that denotes that those debugging verbs are active.  Experiment with
the ones I listed to find out what they do.  Once you've done that, the rest is
simple.

46360: You can't go that way.
46436: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
46468: As good-looking as ever.
46932: This is one of the largest caverns you have ever been in.  The ceiling
is forty feet up, and the walls are quite a ways away.  The ceiling is
supported by massive pillars formed from stalactites and stalagmites.  The
phosphorescent moss that lines the walls provides a dim glow.  Mysterious
carvings have been left on one wall.  There is an opening to the east.

    In
the center of the cave stands the object of your quest:  The massive,
thirty-foot pedestal on which the legendary Toaster of Battle Creek has stood
for centuries.
47304: The ceiling is too high to reach.
47328: It's thirty feet high, round, and perfectly smooth.
47420: You don't know what couses it, but you're grateful for the light it
provides.
47476: The pillars which hold the roof up are formed from stalactites and
stalagmites.
47606: What makes it special is that it is the only one still known to exist.
47746: It's labeled "ACME Rocket Pack."
47776: The skeleton of a coyote.
47848: This is a small, featureless room with no exits apart from the one to
the west.
47904: Just a red rubber ball.
47924: Mysteriously, a red rubber ball is sitting on the floor.
47984: There's a large hole in the floor leading back down to the cavern, and
the exit is to the north.
48136: Walter is here, looking pleased to see you.
