put it anywhere near your mouth.
44434: No.
44454: The fish burns to ash almost instantly. The kitchen is a tad stinky now.
44522: Dig with a SHOVEL, bone!

44614: You have no shovel with which to dig.
44671: It burns to a crisp, leaving behind a shiny new CD-ROM.
44736: You look up Looking for Godot and get the following entry:
     The
broom used to be owned by a powerful witch.
     It is not completely
powerless, even now.
     Just say its command word to it.
     The command
word is "Dickens".
44940: It's closed.
44951: It's open.
44985: Silently, a blue volume appears at your feet.
The broom fades to
nothingness.
45044: The broom does not respond. What a surprise.
45090: You gladly take the worn tome and relax.
45127: Maybe after you find the book. Right now, you don't have the time.
45183: You turn it on, play some inane adventure game about finding a lost copy
of Virginia Woolfe's "To the Lighthouse", and soon get bored and turn it off.
Now back to finding that lost copy of Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot"....
45359: No.
45371: It seems to be used. Ack. You immediately drop it.
45435: .









You kept telling your English teacher you'd have his copy of
Waiting for Godot back "tomorrow". He's getting sick of waiting; you'd better
find it tonight. You have just completed a thorough search of the porch,
finding nothing but a rotting fish.
46100: You can't go that way.
46176: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
46208: As good-looking as ever.
46684: This is your porch. Icky. Books, papers, filth, and stuff you don't
seriously want to think about is all over the place. Your book isn't here,
though... where the bleep is it?

The kitchen is to the west, the back door of
your house is to the south.
46868: Cardboard. Unlikely to hold very much.
46896: The name says it all. It's a pointy wooden toothpick.
46936: It's a dead fish. You don't want to know how it got into your porch.
46988: A herring lies dead on the porch floor... you don't want to know.
47036: Your unkempt lawn is here.

Your porch door is to the north. Your yard
extends to the west.
47104: This is your lawn. With your luck, the book's probably buried in it.
47156: A wooden chest. It's force-proof, laser-proof, radiation-proof...
everything but fireproof.
47228: A collection of hints to adventure games. Just put it in your computer
for a quick hint.
47290: This is your kitchen. Except for the oven and the closet, everything is
covered with dusty papers.

The porch is to the east. To the west is the
bathroom door. The living room is south of here.
47432: The door to the bathroom has a safety lock which can be operated with
anything pointy.
47492: The bathroom door stands open.
47516: The bathroom door is closed.
47536: It's an oven. You can put things you want to cook on it.
47580: A plain-looking closet.
47600: An old wood-handled broom.
47620: This is it! Waiting for Godot! Now you just have to pick it up and your
search is over.
47684: A basic bathroom with basic bathroom furnishings and greenish-blue
sludge. Off to the east is the kitchen.
47760: On this slip of paper is the combination to your shed. You can unlock
the shed with it.
47824: The combination to your shed lies on the side of the bathtub.
47866: This is your living room. Stuff on the floor was probably newspaper
once. Icky. If the book's here, you may as well give up.

The kitchen is to the
north. You can leave the house by going south. A staircase leads up.
48024: It's May and you haven't gotten around to putting the Nativity set away.
You're hopeless. It'll take supernatural intervention to find that book....
48134: Yes, even your computer room is a mess. The only object of any
importance here is the computer.

You can go back down the stairs to the living
room.
48242: An extreme-low-end 486. You can put CD-ROMs in it and turn it on. Past
that, it's useless.
48320: It's stinky.
48332: A sock is draped across the computer table.
48364: The staircase is composed of steps, not surprisingly. It isn't as messy
as the rest of the house, meaning you can sort of see it.
48456: This is your patio. There are a few bits of paper, plastic, and cloth
strewn about haphazardly.

Off to the west some distance is your shed. To the
east you can see your lawn. You can enter your house to the north.
48608: There is an enema here. On your patio. You're not even going to think
about it...
48668: It seems to be used. Ack.
48688: You are just outside your shed. There's nothing much to see here.

Your
patio is to the east.
48756: It's dingy and rotting, unsurprisingly.
48788: The shed is open.
48804: The shed is closed.
48820: Ewwww... What IS all this junk?
48848: You've had it since who-knows-when. It's not quite rusted through; you
might be able to dig in grass or soft earth.
48932: A rusty iron shovel leans against a wall.
