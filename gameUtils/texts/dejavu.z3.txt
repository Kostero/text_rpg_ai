5990: What a horrid dream, all about compiling something. Thank heavens you've
finally woken up, even if you seem to have been sleep-walking. As you dizzily
shake your head, you can't help feeling this place is somehow familiar...
6429: Nothing to do!
6564: Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?
6667: Please answer RESTART, RESTORE or QUIT.
6901: ehm

7180: Bats flutter through the cave, startling you.
7222: A hoarse voice whispers, "PLUGH".
7260: The floor shakes in a sudden earth tremor!
7298: You hear a door creak open, somewhere in the distance.
7352: There is suddenly an immense explosion!  This is unlikely to teach you
not to meddle with things you don't understand, but on the other hand you'll
never do so again.
7518: It is now pitch dark in here!
7860: Are you sure you want to quit?
7911: Please answer yes or no.
7948: Are you sure you want to restart?
8013: Please answer yes or no.
8046: Failed.
8053: Ok.
8064: Failed.
8071: Ok.
8159: Transcripting is already off.
8182: End of transcript.
8231: You are carrying nothing.
8250: You are carrying:
8377: Taken.
8401: As the bishop said to the actress.
8476: You already have that.
8503: That isn't available.
8572: That's hardly portable.
8596: Fixed in place.
8642: You're carrying too many things already.
8712: Already on the floor.
8734: You haven't got that.
8797: Dropped.
8818: Alas, it is closed.
8840: But it isn't there now.
8864: You'll need to take it off first.
8929: Removed.
8967: You need to be holding it before you can put it into something else.
9047: Alas, it is closed.
9069: You'll need to take it off first.
9142: Done.
9211: That isn't in your possession.
9248: First pick that up.
9523: A surreal idea.
9556: You can only get into something on the floor.
9624: But you're aren't in anything at the moment.
9662: You are on your own two feet again.
9698: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
9781: The ignition isn't on at the moment.
9858: You can't go that way.
9887: You can't go that way.
10080: It won't go that way.
10132: As you step falteringly through the darkness, cowardly but evil
creatures devour you whole!
10521: M.
10561: Your sword gives off a bright greenish light!
10623: Darkness, noun. An absence of light to see by.
10663: As good-looking as ever.
11100: I still hate you, though."
11131: Are you trying to poison me?"
11185: I can't see how to unlock that.
11245: That doesn't seem to fit the lock.
11315: I can't see how to lock that.
11343: It is in fact locked now.
11367: First you'll have to close it.
11399: That doesn't seem to fit the lock.
11465: That's not something you can switch.
11555: That's not something you can switch.
11645: That's not something you can open.
11677: It seems to be locked.
11699: It's already open.
11753: That's not something you can close.
11785: It's already closed.
11893: You can't wear that!
11918: You're not holding that!
11974: That was a rhetorical question.
11998: For a moment you can almost hear a hoarse voice say something to you.
But it passes.
12060: In this game, arson is (usually) forbidden.
12102: for a moment there, a deep voice seemed to say "you're on your own".
12154: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
12188: That seems unnecessary.
12208: Keep your mind on the game.
12230: Worth a try, anyway. Why don't you?
12265: That'll keep the vampires away.
12303: Excellent.
12317: A tantalising aroma.
12334: You smell nothing unexpected.
12358: You hear nothing unexpected.
12380: You taste nothing unexpected.
12404: You feel nothing unexpected.
12452: You feel nothing unexpected.
12474: The ground is unsuitable for digging here.
12506: In this game, cutting things up is never helpful.
12544: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
12572: In this game, it is never useful to jump over things.
12612: In this game, it is never useful to tie things.
12653: Unfluoridated and clear.
12672: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
12702: But there's no water here to carry.
12730: Oh, don't apologise.
12760: Once upon a time adventurers had moral standards.
12798: Quite.
12811: Lazily, the snake dodges your attack.
12840: Violence isn't the answer, you know.
12878: Your first reaction is, this is very cold water. Your second reaction is
that it is also very inhabited water. What with the sea-serpent dragging you
down to a rapid drowning (it gurgles "that's for the white crystal ball, you
greedy swine", perhaps mistaking you for someone else) there is no opportunity
for a third opinion.
13107: There's not enough water to swim in.
13136: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
13166: You can't usefully blow that.
13190: You achieve nothing by this.
13216: No, you can't set that.
13275: . Not bad.
13293: The shabby figure waves back at you.
13320: You wave, feeling foolish.
13411: It is fixed in place.
13433: You are unable to.
13448: Nothing obvious happens.
13475: It is fixed in place.
13497: You are unable to.
13512: Nothing obvious happens.
13542: That's not a direction.
13568: Not that way you can't.
13592: Is that the best you can think of?
13617: The car rolls very slowly as you push it.
13673: It is fixed in place.
13695: You are unable to.
13710: Nothing obvious happens.
13758: You achieve nothing by this.
13782: You find nothing of interest.
13815: You find nothing of interest.
13848: You can't see inside, since it is closed.
13975: Futile.
13982: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
14028: No reply.
14040: Nothing is on sale.
14056: No reply.
14130: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
14164: Time passes.
14184: The acoustics of the room subtly alter...
14215: There isn't an echo here.
14248: You have nothing to shoot with.
14276: It is unable to shoot itself.
14307: Your hands suddenly look rather white and skeletal, but then again the
light is getting dimmer, and dear oh dear but it seems cold in here, and so
sleepy...
14629: the old snake dodges your callous blast, leaps forward and sinks its
aged fangs into your wrist. Amazing how the venom is still effective even at
that age, isn't it?
14778: You must have slept yourself out. You certainly aren't drowsy now.
14843: As you take the clover, your sword shines a sudden burst of light!
14898: You flinch from touching the cube, which is white hot!
15006: The snake, predictably, won't let you pass.
15039: You dodge the sad old snake without difficulty.
15099: You pull the pin out, an irrevocable act.
15191: I beg your pardon?
15235: Sorry, that can't be corrected.
15270: Think nothing of it.
15293: d."Oops" can only correct a single word.
15582: You can't begin with a comma.
15636: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
15732: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
16723: I didn't understand that sentence.
16834: You can't see any such thing.
16867: You seem to have said too little!
16899: You aren't holding that!
16928: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
16968: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
17044: You excepted something not included anyway!
17082: You can only do that to something animate.
17120: That's not a verb I recognise.
17922: Sorry, that's beyond my abilities. Which one exactly?
19570: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
19602: You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the
west, and a wall of broken rock to the east. There is a large "Y2" on a rock in
the room's centre.
19816: Sitting on top of the Y2 rock is a featureless white cube.
19862: Large enough to sit inside. Among the controls is a prominent on/off
switch. The numberplate is KAR 1.
19938: The red car sits here, its engine still running.
19972: A little red car is parked here.
19996: !!!! FROBOZZ MAGIC CAR COMPANY !!!!

20224: You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
sight. A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below. Traces of white mist
cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right. Marks in the dust
around the window would seem to indicate that someone has been here
recently.

Directly across the pit from you and 25 feet away there is a similar
window looking into a lighted room. A shadowy figure can be seen there peering
back at you.

A narrow crack in the rocks leads back down.
20586: You are in a dirty broken passage. To the east is a crawl. To the south
is a large passage. Above you is another passage.
20672: In the north wall is an open iron door.
20700: In the north wall is a shut iron door.
20728: The door opened out onto a tiny ledge at the top of the Great Canyon on
its west wall. From here there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of
the Frigid River upstream. Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs
join the mighty ramparts of the Flathead Mountains to the east. Following the
Canyon upstream to the north, Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow.
The mighty Frigid River flows out from a great dark cavern. To the west and
south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles around. It is
absolutely impossible to climb down into the canyon from here.
21146: You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high. The walls are frozen
rivers of orange stone. An awkward canyon and a good passage exit from north
and south sides of the chamber.
21268: Hanging mysteriously in mid-air, at about the height of a kitchen table,
is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.
21356: You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface. A
low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris here, but an
awkward canyon leads north and steps lead up. A note on the wall says:

   
Magic Word "XYZZY"
21532: Labelled Frobozz Magic Ray Gun Co., it works on gerontological
principles.
21588: You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to the
west. There are bricked-up openings to either side. Nearby, a wide stone
staircase leads downward. The hall is filled with wisps of white mist swaying
to and fro almost as if alive. A cold wind blows up the staircase. There is a
passage at the top of a dome behind you.
21826: Perhaps a boa constrictor. Perhaps not.
21858: A sad and decrepit echo of a once-great serpent.
21892: You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall. The
mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.
21986: A dangerous-looking hand grenade rolls about on the floor here.
22030: You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir. An opaque cloud of
white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward. The lake is fed by a stream
which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet overhead and splashes
noisily into the water somewhere within the mist. The only passages go north
and east.
22248: Unlucky for some.
22262: Growing from a tuft of mould is a single two-leafed clover.
22304: This is a large room with a ceiling which cannot be detected from the
ground. There is a narrow passage leading west. The room is deafeningly loud
with an undetermined rushing sound. The sound seems to reverberate from all of
the walls, making it difficult even to think.
22492: Exquisite.
