87840: Max is in the operating room of a hospital. His wife is on the operating
table, breathing quite heavily. There are several doctors and nurses in the
room. He tries to touch one of them but his hand passes right through. His wife
is breathing heavier now. He goes to her, tries to talk to her. She does not
hear. A nurse comes up to Max and tells him if he is cannot calm down he will
have to leave. He watches quietly as they cut open his wife's stomach. He
watches the birth of his son. The nurse comes up to him, handing him the baby.
The doctors have begun to sew up his wife. "You will have to leave now," the
nurse says. He looks down at his baby son, but the child is gone.
88320: Max is in bed with his grandfather Willie. Willie is snoring quite
loudly. Max turns over to tell his grandfather to be quiet when he is assailed
by the smell of grandfather's breath. Willie is fond of cigars and they give
his breath the aroma of used dragon smoke. Max starts to get out of bed, but
finds he is surrounded by an impenetrable darkness. The bed seems to be
floating. Willie begins talking in his sleep. "What's the matter with you," he
says. "You never listen to anything I tell you. You think you're so smart.
You're a bum just like your father. Never listen to me." Willie begins to swing
his hands in his sleep. Max ducks and dodges. Finally he lifts his pillow in
self defense. Under the pillow is a wet cigar.
88836: Max is in cantor Diamond's study. The cantor is a tall man with an open
face and kind eyes. Max is listening to him sing a passage from the haftorah.
Morris Diamond has the most beautiful voice in the world. Long before Max has
ever heard opera, he has heard enough of Morris Diamond to change his life
forever. When he hears the cantor sing he is swept up in the peculair feeling
of tremendous joy and unspeakable sorrow. The cantor's voice touches him in a
way that Max can never forget. Morris asks Max to repeat the passage. Although
he does not have a bad singing voice, his chanting cannot compare with the
cantor's. Max begins to weep, not for his lack of talent, but for his lack of
feeling. How could he follow such a voice. Morris Diamond goes to his desk and
opens a drawer. He takes out a small book and places it on the table before
Max.
89880: Max is walking down a cobble street when a small boy, perhaps a year
old, falls to the pavement from a second story window. The baby gasps and then
does not move. For a moment, Max is paralyzed with horror. Before he can
recover, a woman comes running out of the house screaming, "my baby, my baby."
She lifts the child up high into the air above her, sobbing hysterically. She
runs back inside the house and closes the door behind her.
90188: It is after the first snowfall of winter. The lake has frozen solid. Max
stands on the newly formed ice and listens to the quietness. He can hear the
tinkle of icecicles banging against each other in the wind as they hang off the
evergreen brahcnes. Max feels he is at he center of the universe and that
center is calm. He thinks of Morris Diamond. Max can hear the faint sound of a
dog barking two miles away.
90472: Quite unexpectedly, Max finds himself at his front door. How long has he
been walking, he wonders. And what was he doing out on a night like this?
90576: He can't remember. The fog has obliterated the street behind him. He
fumbles for his house keys, opens his door and climbs the steps.
90672: "A fine thing," he mumbles," to be walking around on such a night. A
person could get lost."

not do something soon, he will be burned alive.

all fall in behind her. The jump rope lies on the ground, lifeless.

day of the summer. They are content to sip lemonade, chat softly and wait for
Cora's roommate to leave the stuffy apartment. Max's desire for Cora is finally
answered as she slips into his arms. He unbottons her blouse and beholds a
vision that will mark him for the rest of his life. Cora's breasts are
beautiful She wears a small silver cross around her neck which falls with
erotic precision in the tuck of her cleavage. A drop of sweat has beaded up on
Cora's collar bone and falls slowly down to meet the cross. For Max, the drop
of sweat is pure magic, the most remarkable thing he has ever witnessed in his
entire life. Cora looks at him warmly and smiles.

breath does.

92700: "A Fable" was written, in GAGS, by Stan Heller.
92740: It's nothing more than a maze given a surreal overcoat. And it's not a
very good maze either.
