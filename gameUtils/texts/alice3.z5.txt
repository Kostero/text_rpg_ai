somehow...
80676: You can't see that in the looking-glass.
80736: The gentle sound of snow against the window pane suggests that it's cold
outside, and you're glad to be here in the warmth. The drawing-room is

81328: But a hearth-rug is meant to be next to the hearth!
81364: You're unable to reach the rug from here.
81396: You try to lift up a corner of the rug, but fail. After a while, you
realise that this is because you are standing on it. How curious the world is!
81500: You lift up a corner of the rug and, peering underneath, discover the
red queen from the chess set.
81572: It's a huge arm-chair, the perfect place for a kitten or a little girl
to curl up in and doze. It has been pushed over to the

silvery mist.
82144: In the looking-glass you can see the drawing-room of the looking-glass
house. What you can see is very much the same as this drawing-room, only all
reversed, left for right. But you are sure that out of the corners of the
glass, where you can't see, the looking-glass world is quite different from
yours.
82360: In the looking-glass you can see the ceiling of the drawing-room of the
looking-glass house. It looks much the same as the ceiling of your
drawing-room.
82468: You can't reach the looking-glass from where you're standing.
82512: Your hand goes right through the silvery mist!
82544: You don't want seven years' bad luck, do you?
82580: Your hand goes right through the silvery mist, and in another moment the
rest of you follows, and you are through the glass...
82668: A discarded ball of worsted lies on the floor here.
82708: It's in a terrible tangle. All that time you spent rolling it up, and
now look at it!
82772: It's a ball of fine blue wool, all rolled up in preparation for some
embroidery.
82828: You're as quick as can be at rolling up balls of wool, though you say so
yourself! Soon it's neat and tidy again.

the warmth.
83050: Better leave the window shut.
83096: Two kittens, one white and one black, are playing together by the
arm-chair.
83152: is. Why, it's quite definitely your favourite of the pair, and much
prettier than that naughty

animal!
83444: You can't hold two kittens at once!
83472: . What a beautiful creature it is!
