20690: Quite.
20701: Violence isn't the answer to this one.

21510: Time passes.
21525: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
44351: You do your best to push the large machine about until it appears to be
oriented correctly.
44723: You are far to large to get inside the small pail!
44791: Just look at it!
44810: You can't close a tin bucket, silly!
44863: The small pool of water flows out of the bucket and is absorbed by the
thirsty, dry ground below.
45001: You can't tie anything to it until it's raised.
45047: You tie the bucket onto the end of the rope.
45080: The bucket is already tied to the rope and crank assembly!
45134: The ball bounces off the bucket causing a hollow gong sound.
45216: The ball knocks the bucket over spilling it's contents.
45365: The small pool of water flows out of the bucket and is absorbed by the
thirsty, dry ground below.
45459: Your attempts at climbing the tall, straight tree are laughable.  The
acorns are far above your head and you are unable to reach them.
45566: The small acorn is wedged into one of the bullet holes in the rusty tin
bucket.
45621: It is a shiny, new, green acorn with one or two scratch marks.
45907: The ball sails through the now glassless window and disappears.
45965: The window high above your head frames a large pane of soot blackened
glass with red and yellow concentric circles painted on it.
46054: The window is nothing more than a large dark hole in the stone of the
building with a few jagged edges of glass shards around the frame.
46263: A shower of shiny green acorns accompanies the ball down.
46304: The ball bounces about the branches of the tree before falling back to
the ground bellow.
46500: The acorns are young and none of them have yet fallen from the tree.
46549: It looks as if some of the acorns have been knocked free.
47248: The ball bounces uselessly off the grey stone and lands on the ground.
47311: The ball hits the wall surrounding the well and is bounced back into the
court yard.
47384: The ball wedges into the space between two bars of the gate and hangs
there momentarily before popping out and falling to the ground below.
47493: The ball bounces off the nest and back into the court yard.  A startled
squirrel dashes away from the collection of well woven twigs and leaves only to
tentatively return a minute or two later.
47660: The ball hurtles into the old tennis court net.  Amazingly the net
holds, though several strands do come loose and flutter to the ground, and the
ball springs back at you, bounces off your chest, and falls to the ground.
47822: The ball lands uselessly on the ground.
47856: The ball machine's spring mechanism twangs noisily, and uselessly given
nothing to throw, then pulls slowly back into place in preparation for another
launch.
47975: The machine is old and incrusted with dirt, but it looks as if it might
still work.
48042: Why would you want to get inside a ball machine even if you could fit?
48174: There's no way to close the machine.
48207: The old machine is too bulky to fit!
48306: The launching spring begins to coil back into place.
48353: The machine's noisy symphony winds to a halt.
48588: You can't tie anything to it until it's raised.
48632: You tie the bucket onto the end of the rope.
48665: The bucket is already tied to the rope and crank assembly!
48972: Just before you are able to reach down and grasp the pail's handle you
think you catch sight of a small object drain out through the holes with the
water!
49374: GREAT.  THEY'VE DONE IT TO ME AGAIN.  You think to yourself. THEY'VE
STUCK ME IN ANOTHER ONE OF THEIR SILLY SCENARIOS.  You glance about with a look
of irritation on your face.  WELL, I'LL SHOW THEM.  I'LL MAKE SHORT WORK OF
THEIR STUPID LITTLE PUZZLE...

52260: Moves:
52268: Time:
52276: You can't go that way.
52376: A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.
 To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall
with an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion
rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.
 In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the
west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made
of sticks, twigs, and leaves.

A carpeting of old brown leaves from past
winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a
cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of
the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming
light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly
healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of
crumbling stone.
53032: A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.
53104: It's a rather disgusting tennis ball covered in mold and smelling of
mildew.
53232: A very small wooden key that seems to have been carved by hand, perhaps
by a previous prisoner.
53394: Upon closer inspection you find a small key hole in the border of the
iron barrier.
53452: The old net looks as if it would fall apart if touched.
53492: It's just an old, green tennis court with discolored, cracked paving.
53544: A typical squirrels nest which looks more like a large wad of random
woodland debris than the carefully woven, sturdy structure that it is.
