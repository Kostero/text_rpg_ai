94770: Smoke pillars rise from the landscape like ghostly skyscrapers while
debris-filled craters mark every visible portion of land. Fires pollute the air
and ashes drift like schools of dead fish. Bones, still holding flesh as if
they might yet be resurrected, lie about in numbers beyond comprehension.

The
disaster was swift and the destruction wholesale.

You stand alone, face
disfigured, hips bent to the left, innards exposed on your arms, legs, and
abdomen. The enemy has moved on, swiftly destroying the entire planet. 

You
stare through blue, mechanical eyes, methodically traversing your surroundings,
hoping to find some sign that you did not completely fail.
95276: Reacting to your internal suggestion, the flight skin tightens slightly
and aligns itself with the magnetic field surrounding the planet. Then,
suddenly, you feel the power of flight as your body leaps into the air....
95434: You must activate your flight skin before attempting to fly.
95484: Auto-Repair says, "Flight-Skin is currently being repaired."
95536: Auto-Repair says, "Partial systems failure."
95614: Auto Repair says, "Complete system failure imminent."
95664: Your meter and a half frame is currently completely encased by the
flight skin organism.
95728: Standing about a meter and a half in height, your external feminine
coverings are nearly unrecognizable beyond the damage done in battle. You
examine yourself and once again shrug at the human engineer that decided to
make you in her own image. Outside of the normal humaniform features is a wide
utility belt built into your waist
95954: Your face is disfigured and torn, exposing wires and pieces of bent
metal.
96014: Both of your legs have sharp burns showing surface damage.
96058: Your arms have scrapes and burns but nothing too serious.
96106: Your hips are bent to the left from the impact of a nearby shock
grenade. It does not seem to be impeding your stride too much.
96340: You can't remove the utility belt because it is a part of you.
96436: smoke litter the entire landscape while ashen clouds form dark and
foreboding shapes in an angry red sky. The earth trembles from dislocated
tectonic plates and the atmosphere is quickly becoming unbreathable and
unlivable. A smoking forest can be seen to the west, a large steel-gray city is
burning to the north, and the edge of an enormous smoldering crater lies to the
east.
96696: In all directions you behold an eerie site. Everything is frozen, from
the cotton like smoke, to the reddish orange flames of burning embers. A forest
below what seems to be a tremendous cloud of frozen smoke can be seen to the
west, a large city to the north, and a crater to the east.
96896: Through wisps of smoke you see a tremendous crater.
96936: Vaporous clouds weave through a city skyline devastated by holocaust.
96984: A burning forest forms a wall of smoke and ashes.
97024: A vast wasteland of burning flesh overwhelms the southern view.
97072: As you gaze upward you see an angry red sky filled with clouds of smoke
and floating ash.
97136: The destruction makes it impassable.
97168: Like evil specters, ashen clouds cast foreboding shapes, hovering above
the land. High above in the darkened sky you see the tiny flickering of
spacecraft in orbit around the planet.
97296: Through ashes and flames the remains of a forest blisters the western
horizon.
97352: Through wisps of unnatural fog you glimpse a deep and wide crevice.
Memory lapses prevent you from remembering how this crater was formed, but a
quick reading of gases and radiation tell you that a small thermonuclear device
was detonated recently.
97528: Outside of the large crater to the east, there are many smaller craters
marking the landscape.
97600: Standing on the southern edge of the largest city on the planet, you
survey the results of thermonuclear war. Although some structures remain
standing, there is nothing left but the plasteel infrastructures of once proud
and magnificent towers and buildings. A dense fog of death parades around the
city in dust-devil frenzy. The stench of burnt flesh and fused materials is
overwhelming and guards the city far better than its previous occupants ever
could.
97920: Standing on the southern edge of the largest city on the planet, you
survey the results of thermonuclear war. Although some structures remain
standing, there is nothing left but the plasteel infrastructures of once proud
and magnificent towers and buildings. Thick frozen fog hovers above the entire
landscape and a noticeable absence of smell is present.
98168: The smell of burning flesh forces you to turn off your external sensors
for a moment. It's simply overwhelming, even to an android.
98264: Your external sensors indicate a distinct lack of smell.
98304: The land drops out of view, as if sunken in dispair.
98344: A large city, bent in destruction, encompasses the northern skyline.
98392: Through a distant ashen smog you see the remains of a space port.
98440: A battlefield drifts in and out of view through a dense fog.
98488: As you gaze upward you see an angry red sky filled with clouds of smoke
and floating ash.
98636: the large forest west of the city is now a field of burning stumps and
smoking brush. The battlefield can be seen to the east and a burning field
opens to the west.
98752: A battlefield drifts in and out of view through a dense fog.
98800: The burning forest stretches out of sight.
98832: The forest dwindles into a burning field.
98864: As you gaze upward you see an angry red sky filled with clouds of smoke
and floating ash.
98928: The vast farmland west of the city and forest is completely blackened by
plasma-fire and thermonuclear explosions. The radiation is so bad here that no
human, animal, or plant life could have survived. The remains of a forest can
be seen to the east and the remains of the spaceport can be seen to the
northwest.
99144: A burning forest stretches out of sight.
99176: The scorched fields continue beyond sight.
99208: Through ashen smog you see the remains of a space port.
99248: As you gaze upward you see an angry red sky filled with clouds of smoke
and floating ash.
99312: The remnants of a forest and space port can be seen to the east and
northwest, respectively.
99376: High radiation and wisps of smoke dance within the confines of this
enormous catastrophe. You're at the center of a crater created by a
thermonuclear weapon, two hundred meters below the natural landscape and half a
klick east of the battlefield. Through the haze, a smaller crevice appears on
the northeast edge of the crater.
99600: The crater angles steeply. Too steeply to traverse.
99640: A small crevice appears through the haze.
99672: As you gaze upward you see an angry red sky filled with clouds of smoke
and floating ash.
99736: The crater is too steep here, you can't seem to get more than a dozen
meters before sliding back down to the center.
99816: Through the smoking debris a lone crevice can be seen to the northeast.
Your internal sensors suggest this may have been a river before the war.
99916: Once an active space port, the surrounding area is now a cemetery of
twisted ships, buildings, and hangars. A large hole, presumably once the
control tower, marks the center of a wide circle of destruction. Smoking fields
can be seen to the southeast.
100096: Your Main System replies, "Ambiguous query. Please restate your
intentions."
100156: There are literally hundreds of twisted ships, mainly light
non-spacefaring aircraft that operated off the magnetic field of the planet,
although a few of them are of the larger, 'warp' variety.
100296: The light planet-bound spacecraft are completely destroyed.
100340: Clearly, the warp ships received extra attention in the recent battle.
All of them are melted slags of metal. Amazingly, one such ship survived
complete destruction, so much so that the name 'Caledonia' is still visible on
it's hull.
100510: The Caledonia looks to have been a reconnaissance warp vehicle. The
nose of the ship is twisted into a single mass of plasteel, while much of the
main cabin seems to have survived. A hole, probably where the air-lock once
was, has been blasted through to the inside.
100698: You climb inside the Caledonia...
100732: Inside the Caledonia's main cabin the destruction is more personal.
Four distinct blasts incinerated the crew, their charred remains fused with the
port-side hull. The air-lock was breached with a large plasma rifle or some
directed explosive, the bridge of the ship is a ball of melted plasteel, and
the rear compartments seem to be in a similar state.
100982: Since the safety cable is attached to your belt and to the control
panel, leaving the ship is impossible.
101058: The hull is mostly intact except for the burn marks from recently
deceased and the bridge.
101128: The rear compartment is a mass of impenatrable plasteel.
101168: The blast created a hole just large enough to remove the air-lock
itself, but the control panel is still visible.
101250: The control panel is in ruins except for a safety cable which is
attached at both ends to the control panel.
101332: The control panel is in ruins except for a safety cable which is
attached at one end to the control panel.
101410: The control panel is in ruins except for two small sockets where a
safety cable can be attached.
101484: The control panel sockets are small octagonal fittings, universal in
design, for connecting a safety belt or a spacewalking tether.
101592: The safety cable is a short (one meter) length of sofsteel cabling used
to protect against emergency depressurization while in space. Anyone secured to
the control panel via the safety cable would be anchored against such a
consequence and hopefully have time to secure at least one of the hatches of
the air-lock
102106: You must detach an end of the safety cable before you can attach it to
something else.
102410: The AEFG System says, "Inventory manipulation in FAST TIME is extremely
dangerous. For your protection, this command will be ignored.
102520: The Main System says, "Both the AEFG and FlightSkin Systems report
drastic consequences for this action. For your protection, it will be ignored.
102630: You can't drop the safety cable while it is attached to your belt.
102680: In the bottom of the riverbed, you find the boiled and battered remains
of both animal and plant life. Although the river once flowed from north to
south, only the north seems passable. On either side, one to the southwest and
one to the east, you see small ledges to carry you up and out of the river
bottom.
102894: Through wisps of smoke you see a tremendous crater.
102934: Vaporous clouds weave through a city skyline devastated by holocaust.
102986: The riverbed is angles upward steeply and remains impassable.
103036: A series of small ledges look climbable in that direction.
103082: As you gaze upward you see an angry red sky filled with clouds of smoke
and floating ash.
103150: The southern portion of the riverbed is filled with dangerous pitfalls.
103202: The western bank of the riverbed is too steep, but a slight adjustment
to the southwest allows you an escape.
103284: The northwest portion of the bank is far too high to even consider
climbing.
103342: Between the open riverbed to the north and the ledge leading up to the
east, a tower of rock blocks any movement.
103424: The gradually higher southeast bank is beyond your reach.
103466: Your sensors determine that nearly ninety-seven percent of the water
once contained in this riverbed has evaporated and the remaining moisture is
hardly noticable by even your equipment.
103600: The range of species destroyed with the river is too numerous to
classify. You turn your attention elsewhere.
103678: Clearly, the river has been destroyed by the war. The most likely cause
is the extreme temperatures from thermonuclear bombs.
103768: Adjusting to low light, you make out the muddy remains of a once
thriving underground river. Fossils and roots adorn the floors, walls, and
ceiling while the echoes of splashing water emanate from all around. Mud still
glistens with sweat throughout most of the tunnel.
103956: As you gaze upward you see an angry red sky filled with clouds of smoke
and floating ash.
104022: Everything glistens with the muddy remnants of a once thriving
underground river.
104082: Main Systems says, "Mud: A slimy, sticky, or slippery mixture of water
and silt or clay-sized earth material, with the consistency ranging from
semi-fluid to soft and plastic."

"Let's move on Chrysilya," it continues in a
firm robotic tone.
104266: Various amphibian fossils can be seen embedded in the glistening mud.
104322: As you closely examine the walls, it becomes clear that the western
wall is drier compared to the rest of the tunnel. In fact, a distinct
rectangular shape can be seen within the drier mud.
104460: It seems to be a door of some kind.
104490: The door is hidden within the wall somehow.
104528: Taking a chance, you press inward on the door-like shape and after a
brief hissing noise, the wall opens.
104604: Main Systems says, "I would suggest pushing on the door. This looks
like a model 6XA7B4901-09 underground river hidden door and that is the method
used to open this model door."
104742: There doesn't seem to be anyway to close it.

Main Systems notices your
pause and reples, "I don't know either."
104830: You've just entered what seems to be a hidden enemy bunker. It's clear
that the Tra 'Jan Gore were entrenched long before they began the war. The
bunker is empty except for a plasma rifle rack on the far wall.
104982: The rack once contained hundreds of weapons. Unfortunately, it is empty
now.
105040: In all directions the land is a waste. Craters, bones, flesh, smoke,
and the remnants of war litter the entire landscape. The sky, an angry red, is
filled with ashen clouds. The earth trembles from dislocated tectonic plates
and the atmosphere is quickly becoming unbreathable and unlivable. A plume of
gas shoots out of the ground nearby and an unopened rusty hatch has been
uncovered in the ground.
105320: In all directions the land is a waste. Craters, bones, flesh, smoke,

below the ground.
105598: In all directions the land is a waste. Craters, bones, flesh, smoke,

and the atmosphere is quickly becoming unbreathable and unlivable. A plume of
gas shoots out of the ground nearby.
105838: A plume of gas shoots out of the ground nearby, forcing you to stumble
sideways.
105898: Nothing but barren country can be seen.
105934: Vaporous clouds weave through a city skyline devastated by holocaust.
105986: A dried-up riverbed weaves through the land and beyond that, a huge
crater can be seen.
106054: As you gaze upward you see an angry red sky filled with clouds of smoke
and floating ash.
106118: You don't see a way to climb downward from here.
106156: The land is blackened from battle, leaving nothing behind.
106202: You scrabble down onto all fours and dig your fingers into the ground
near the geyser. After an hour of hard labor, you finally locate and clear dirt
off of a square rusty hatch.
106332: You've been digging around here already. The rusty hatch is proof
enough of that.
106396: The skeletal remains of all life on this planet can be seen everywhere.
Whatever damage the enemy had done, leaving the remains was likely a reminder
to whomever may think of challenging them again.
106538: From the burning land rises foul-colored gases and smoke. Where flesh
and bone will eventually turn into soil, most of the living have been vaporized
and are now apart of a death-filled fog.
106678: The gas plume is shooting pure hydrogen out of a manmade hole in the
ground.
106734: The gas plume is currently frozen, as if a tree of cotton stood in
front of you.
106794: Ignoring the gas plume, you try to look inside the vent and fail to
discern anything extraordinary.
106870: The hole is about twenty centimeters wide, obviously the broken portion
of a cooling system buried beneath the ground.
106954: The hatch is about a meter square, rusted, with a handle inset into the
metal.
107016: The hatch swings open, revealing darkness below.
107052: You push the hatch up and it bangs onto the surface above.
107200: ymechanically deployed bunker). The interior hatch in the floor is
closed and the
107330: Typical in wartime, the rations are basic liquid and solid refreshment
usable by humans and androids.
107408: You can't eat while the AEFG is activated.
107442: You can't eat while the flight skin is activated.
107484: You consume what seems to be the last of the rations. Hopefully, you
won't need to find anymore.
107558: Auto-Repair says, "Main systems are now at full power."
107608: The interior hatch is about a meter round and locked.
107676: units were designed to withstand two assaults. The first assault would
give access to this room and the second assault would eventually gain access to
the lower compartment. It seems as though there was no second assault because
the interior hatch remains locked and intact."
107864: You bang on the interior hatch but there is no response. Internal
sensors are unable to penetrate the floor. There is no way to know if anyone is
down there.
107974: Hovering about three hundred meters above the ground you survey the
battlefield below. The destruction is even more daunting from up here.
108072: With only a minor communication, the flight-skin gently carries you to
the ground....
108136: You close your eyes and communicate to the flight skin that you wish to
travel to the planet's orbital plane.

With a sudden hardening, the skin turns
you into a speeding bullet, streaking though clouds, thin air, and then into
space....

Spectral lights and noise attack your senses as you fly through the
different layers of atmosphere. Suddenly, you're swimming in the dead silence
of the void.
108418: In all directions, the pocked-mark devistation smokes and billows from
below. You fly around in circles, afraid of losing the landmarks below.
108526: From this height you see the destruction of an entire continent. Little
remains of the once plush green earth, the rolling hills, crystal lakes, and
shining cities.
108644: The immensity of space overwhelms the senses and humbles even the most
callous soul. For an android, it is a baptism of power, because your human
creator gave you the ability to be here, and weakness, because one rather small
android in the middle of space is hardly anything that matters....
108854: Floating in a low orbital plane, you peer down at an ash covered world.
All around you are the lights of distant stars and the loneliness of the void.
108962: Normally this view would be breathtaking, and concentrating on the
large bodies of water, it is. But when you look at the land based areas of the
planet, all hope fades, for the planet is blackened and burning. Even from this
height you can see massive destruction. It doesn't appear that a single area of
habitation has survived the war with the Tra 'Jan Gore.
109226: The sleek ship is one of the Tra 'Jan Gore's lightweight spacecraft,
modeled after their most revered idol, a fish called the "Cho 'Ang Zore". With
large dorsal and pectral fins, a pair of forward windows, the ship clearly
bears the idols resemblance.

Main Systems notes, "The reason they chose this
particular fish is because of its quite deadly striking capabilities."
109500: The Cho 'Tak Ru seems frozen in place.
109536: Unfortunately, the Cho 'Tak Ru is moving too fast and already moving
away from you. No matter how hard you try, you can't seem to grab onto the
sides.
109646: The AEFG does the job, allowing you to grapple onto the spaceship. You
quickly locate the hatch, searching for some way to gain entry.

Main Systems
says, "Safety sub-systems report an extemely high chance of failure in this
course of action. I suggest returning to the planet. Immediately."
109866: Main Systems says, "Tra 'Jan Gore Chrysilya. Safety sub-systems
recommend immediate return to the planet's atmosphere."
110086: There is a small button next to the door.
110120: With the Cho 'Tak Ru moving so swiftly, you get slightly disoriented
and slip away...
110184: As you press the small button, the air-lock depressurizes and the door
swings inward. You jump free of the door before it closes behind you and the
air-lock pressurizes, filling with oxygen.
110320: The ships computer says, "Captain, there is an intruder in the
air-lock; species android; main systems at full strength; no apparent weapons.
Advise caution."
110448: This is the air-lock of the small ship.
110480: The inner hatch opens to the ship proper, while the outer hatch close.
110536: The inner hatch is closed, while the outer hatch opens to the void of
space.
110592: A panel on one of the two remaining walls controls them. The airlock is
currently
110650: You can't leave the air-lock while attached to the safety cable (which
is attached to the control panel).
110732: You can't leave the air-lock while attached to the safety cable (which
is attached to the control panel).
110812: The inner hatch, currently sealed, leads to the main cabin of the ship
and has a small window.
110884: The inner hatch leads to the main cabin of the ship and stands open.
110936: The outer hatch leads to space and is safely sealed shut.
110978: The control panel consists of a green button, a white button, and a red
button. Below the three buttons is a safety cable which is attached at both
ends to the control panel,
111106: The control panel consists of a green button, a white button, and a red
button. Below the three buttons is a safety cable which is attached at one end
to the control panel.
111232: The control panel consists of a green button, a white button, and a red
button. Below the three buttons are two small sockets where a safety cable can
be attached.
111346: The control panel sockets are small octagonal fittings, universal in
design, for connecting a safety belt or a spacewalking tether.
111444: It's green, shaped like an arrow, and points to the inner hull door.
111498: The Tra 'Jan Gore soldier is ejected from the ship! You have only a
moment before he recovers.
111574: The pressure from inside the ship forces you out into space, along with
the Tra 'Jan Gore soldier, who quickly grabs you and fires a plasma bolt
directly into your torso...
111700: Quickly, you open the inner hull door...

"KRISH NU KAI!!!!!!" yells a
surprised Tra 'Jan Gore soldier...

...and then your sworn enemy recovers,
quickly brandishing its plasma rifle and pointing it at your chest...

PHRISH!
PHRISH! PHRISH!, three bolts of plasma-fire exit the rifle and milliseconds
later turn your body into a pile of melted android parts...
111992: It's a small white button without any indication to its use.
112036: Main Systems says, "Pressurizing the airlock with the outer door open
wouldn't be prudent.
112106: The Tra 'Jan Gore soldier presses a button and the outer hatch begins
to release.
112174: You push the white button and the air is suddenly sucked out of the
chamber.
112232: The flight skin protects you from the airless room though.
112274: Fortunately, your self-protection systems activate the Flight Skin...
112334: You push the white button and the air is suddenly sucked out of the
chamber.
112390: Main Systems says, "Pressurizing the airlock with the outer door open
wouldn't be prudent.
112458: You push the white button and the air is restored inside the chamber.
112514: It's red, shaped like an arrow, and points to the outer hull door.
112570: The combination of the air-lock opening along with the sudden
depressurization of the air-lock catapults you out of the ship along with the
safety cable.
112682: The combination of the air-lock opening and depressurizing catapults
you into space.
112748: The outer hull door opens to a calm and empty view of space.
112796: It's a small round window that shows a portion of the inside of the
spaceship.
112856: As you look through the window, a Tra 'Jan Gore soldier leaps into
view.
112910: Through the window in the inner hatch you see a Tra 'Jan Gore soldier
coming into the main cabin from the bridge.
112994: The Tra 'Jan Gore soldier stares at you with a wide grin and a large
battle rifle in its arms.
113068: Movement in the inner hatch window forces you to notice the Tra 'Jan
Gore soldier staring directly at you with a wide grin.
113160: The Tra 'Jan Gore soldier reaches for the red button on the inner
control panel...
113222: An intuition tells you to look inside the ship and is confirmed. The
Tra 'Jan Gore soldier is reaching for the red button on the inner control
panel...
113334: The Tra 'Jan Gore soldier presses the red button...
113378: Through the window you see the Tra 'Jan Gore soldier press the red
button...
113444: As you're ejected from the air-lock, your flight skin activates
automatically...
113508: You're violently ejected from the air-lock...
113552: The inside of the ship is a utilitarian's utopia. Inset lockers line
both sides, a hatch leads to the pressure chamber and an open doorway leads to
the bridge.
113664: The Tra 'Jan Gore soldier outside of the ship is quickly making his way
back...
113728: Through the window of the inner hatch, you can see that the Tra 'Jan
Gore soldier is quickly making his way back to the ship...
113824: The Tra 'Jan Gore soldier is back inside the airlock and moving fast...
113880: Through the window of the inner hatch, you can see the Tra 'Jan Gore
soldier reach the airlock...
113952: Before you can reach the bridge, the Tra 'Jan Gore soldier leaps into
the ship and fires a plasma bolt into your back.
114038: You can't go anywhere while the safety cable is attached to you and the
control panel.
114104: A standard plasma rifle locked to killing force.
114138: As you aim the rifle through the airlock, the Tra 'Jan Gore soldier
leaps forward...but you have just enough time to fire a single plasma bolt into
its chest, killing it.
114266: You can't fire through the airlock doors.
114312: The control panel consists of a green button, a white button, and a red
button. Below the three buttons
114528: The enemy is at least two and half meters tall, wearing heavy body
armor and a fierce grin.
114592: The Tra 'Jan Gore soldier leaps back into the ship, aims his plasma
rifle at you and fires.
114664: This is the bridge of the ship, where command controls reside. There is
no door between here and outward to the aft cabin.
114762: Your main systems include all functions that provide information and
health to your android body.
114836: Your systems report a list of several million 'things' that you could
theoretically identify in your sensor range and concludes that this command is
a malfunction.

Main systems replies, "Please be more specific."
114992: Main Systems says, "Another bug in the system Chrysilya. Please avoid
that command for the time being."
115070: Main Systems says, "Jumping in mid-air may seem like an appropriate
task to you, but it is causing a great deal of confusion among the sub-systems.
Please stop using that command."
115202: Main Systems ignores your command.
115234: Main Systems says, "Another bug in the system Chrysilya. Please avoid
that command for the time being."
115318: Main Systems says, "Jumping in zero-gravity may seem like an
appropriate task to you, but it is causing a great deal of confusion among the
sub-systems. Please stop using that command."
115454: Main Systems ignores your command.
115494: Your memory systems include all of your past experiences recorded in
artificial synaptic loops.
115562: "Chrysilya!" cries a little girl nearby. You try to look for the
wimpering child, suddenly seeing her dirty face...

PHRISH! PHRISH! PHRISH! the
distinct sound of a plasma rifle suddenly obliterates the little girl and
silences her cries.

Your deeply encoded human protection systems are reeling
from the attack. Other children cry out, followed by more plasma bolts, and
then longer moments of silence. On your knees, with your empty plasma rifle,
you bite down an urge to wail when suddenly a roving Tra 'Jan Gore landbiter
hits you square in the chest, dragging you until your systems begin to fail...
116010: "INCOMING!!!", yells Dal MKor, and everyone in the bunker ducks down to
shield their heads.

BOOOM!!! BOOOM!!! BOOOM!!!

The bombs explode one after
another and immediately afterwards Dal yells at you, "Get the time displacement
device!!! It's our only hope now!!!"

He pushes you up through the hatch and
immediately pulls it shut.

People are fighting and dying everywhere. Bombs are
exploding, plasma bursts are streaking through the sky, and smoke fills the
air. You can barely see a meter in any direction when suddenly a Tra 'Jan Gore
troop marches by, and you dive for cover...
116464: "Chrysilya, welcome to Earthangelos!" says a tall dark man. "I am Dal
Mkor, your sponsor." Pointing to a group of small children he says, "Your
charge is here to greet you." Then speaking to the children he says, "Alright
kids, say hello to Chrysilya." and the children obediantly sing, "Hellooo
Chrysilya!!!" and give you a short round of applause.

Your internship has
begun at last. You will be the sole teacher for these children for the next
twelve years, guiding them through adolesence and into adulthood. Your synaptic
nervous system is unusually fluid today. You feel almost emotional...
116898: "Dal Mkor is showing you Earth's primary protection mechanism in an
underground cavern. "As you know Chrysilya, we've had warnings about a
potential invasion by the Tra 'Jan Gore. We've prepared for this possiblity for
hundreds of years. This device (pointing to a massive cylindrical container) is
a large-field time displacement device. If left untouched, it will memorize
everything within this solar system. While we are at peace, the device is
'reset' every night at midnight. If we were ever to come under attack, we would
simply wait until we knew as much as possible about the attack, and execute a
recall on the device. This must be done by an android since no human is likely
to survive a large scale invasion.

By executing a recall, everything in the
solar system would revert back to the original reset-point, except for that
android, who would remember everything.

Anything within about 12 meters of the
device will in fact remain exactly the same. Everything outside of that 12
meter space out to 500 billion kilometers would be reverted. We've chosen you
Chrysilya to handle this critical duty. We plan to add armor and other
essential protections to your android body so you can withstand any assault."
117764: Memory Systems says, "Flashbacks are being triggered by visual
patterns. I'm attempting to fix the problem. Please be patient."
117862: Memory Systems says, "It appears that the problem is in the central
memory core. One of the redundant bridges is corrupted by plasma burns. This
may need a surgical bath."
117988: Memory Systems says, "All diagnostic measures have been exhausted. The
flashback problem will continue until a surgical bath is located."
118092: Memory Systems, "Nothing new to report."
118130: Memory Systems, "Nothing to report."
118192: The anti-entropic field generator operates internally within one of
your sub-systems using the commands, [SLOW TIME] and [FAST TIME]. In a confined
area (your body space), the AEFG will speed up time so that your surroundings
seem to be frozen.
118384: The AEFG system responds, "System recharging. Check [SYSTEMS] for more
details."
118456: The AEFG system responds, "Slow time already achieved."
118502: Your immediate surroundings begin to flow normally again.

The AEFG
system confirms, "Slow time achieved."
118586: The AEFG system responds, "System recharging. Check [SYSTEMS] for more
details."
118664: Everything begins to blur for a moment and then all of your
surroundings seem to stop. There is neither sound nor movement.
118750: The AEFG system responds, "Fast time already achieved."
118798: The AEFG System says, "System recharged."
118850: Your flight skin is a living organism that resides in a small portion
of your plasteel skull. When activated with the command [SKIN], the organism
will 'pour' itself over your entire body, giving you nearly perfect atmospheric
safety, including all oxygen required by your andriod body. Once the skin is in
place, you can use normal vertical and compass rose directions to fly. A second
[SKIN] command will send the organism back into its protective home. The skin
does not provide protection against most weapons.
119224: Your flight skin is currently active.
119252: Your flight skin is currently deactivated.
119288: You cannot activate the flight skin while the safety cable is attached
to your belt.
119348: Activating the flight skin is simply a matter of twitching a specific
nerve deep within your skeletal structure....

Through an opening the size of a
nail, the organism flows out and begins the process of enveloping your external
structure. It does this within a matter of seconds, eventually closing over
your face and providing oxygen.
119588: Your self-protection is built far too deeply into your brain to
accomodate this request.
119654: The organism slowly returns through the aperature in your skull,
leaving you in your normal state.
119728: [Your face is marred by burns, but functional. Auto-repair will not
waste power to repair it. Your arms and legs are lacerated with burns and large
wounds. Auto-repair has already begun working on these. Your hip is seriously
dislocated. Auto-repair cannot handle the damage. You're seriously dehydrated
and low on energy. Auto-repair currently cannot locate any resources for
replenishment. Auto-repair reports that resources are required within
120132: This brings a smile to your damaged face. Auto-repair always makes you
feel human, especially when reporting upon your eventual demise.
120234: You're still damaged in places, but for the most part, back to full
strength.
120296: Auto-Repair says, "The [SKIN] command is currently unavailable."
120352: Auto-Repair says, "The Anti-Entropic Field Generator is currently
offline."
120412: Auto-Repair says, "The Anti-Entropic Field Generator is currently
offline."
120476: This work was inspired by Dan Simmons's Hyperion books, as well as all
of the other great science fiction authors that I have enjoyed reading over the
years. The text output is controlled by the status of your well-being - you are
afterall, an android. Actions within the game allow you to regain your full
power, but to me, this is an element of the experience of being an android, and
should therefore not be turned off in order to view the story as it was
intended. However, if you find this completely annoying, please enter the
command [NOSLOW], which puts you into what I call -ZarfMode-, since Andrew
Plotkin told me in an e-mail one time that if I ever implemented this feature,
he would immediately close the game and never play it again. ZarfMode can be
exited by entering [GOSLOW].

121168: Main Systems says, "Chrysilya, Your action is unclear."
121212: Main Systems says, "The ground looks soft and if the memory systems are
sqwuaking for a good reason, then we're standing above a human construction."
121324: Main Systems says, "Memory Systems is reporting that something might be
found near the geyser you visited earlier."
121412: Main Systems says, "Maybe we should investigate what's below the
hatch."
121472: Main Systems says, "Maybe we should investigate what's below the hatch
near the geyser."
121538: Main Systems says, "I believe the rations would be very helpful."
121594: Main Systems says, "I believe the rations in the dark chamber would be
very helpful."
121664: Main Systems says, "Memory Systems report access to the space port off
to the west. We might find more information there."
121754: Main Systems says, "Maybe you should look around some more."
