135252: Oh great. More junk. We're building up quite a collection, aren't we?
135340: on top of my head. What did your last slave die of?
135428: Mmm, sleep, that sounds nice. But first I need to find a nice, cosy,
comfortable bed to curl up in.
135760: It would be better to empty it into a bowl of some sort.
135800: I should be able to mix them by pouring them into a suitably large
container.
135856: is just right as it is. Why don't I just eat it?
135924: Okay, I poured the cold porridge and the hot porridge into the gigantic
bowl. Now I have one gigantic bowl of JUST-RIGHT porridge! Now why didn't the
Three Bears think of that? I guess I must be smarter than the average bear!
136092: It would slip through my fingers. And my hands would get all messy.
136140: What, with my fingers? Eeuurgh! No way!
136172: I am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have
come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original features
and totally lacking in "mod cons." A large dining table sits in the centre of
the room and there is a dresser against the wall. Opposite the dresser is an
enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill half the room.
136428: It looks rather rustic, which is to say that it looks like a bunch of
logs crudely nailed together.
136500: It's just a spoon, okay! Don't get so excited!
136536: Three bears, three bowls and only one spoon. Breakfast time must be
fun, fun, fun in this family.
136616: An earthenware bowl with the word "PAPA" glazed on it.
136660: What, you think I have an asbestos tongue or something?
136700: OW! That porridge is far too hot, I burned my tongue now you doofus!
136752: This porridge is hotter than the hinges of hell - my puny breath
doesn't make a lot of difference.
136836: An earthenware bowl with the word "MAMA" glazed on it.
136880: Eeeurrgh! I'm not eating that, it's STONE COLD!
136936: An earthenware bowl with the word "BABY" glazed on it.
136980: I've had quite enough porridge thankyou!
137012: Mmmmm! That porridge tasted JUST RIGHT! Pity there wasn't more of it
though, I'm starving!!!
137092: Must be where Mama bear cooks all her porridge. I don't know why she
doesn't just get herself a microwave.
137168: There is a blazing fire in the hearth!
137196: The hearth is cold and full of ash.
137224: Something glints among the embers...
137252: Somehow I don't think a load of cold ashes is going to make a very good
fire.
137308: I'm not sure a ceramic bowl is the best sort of container for cooking
porridge in. There must be some other way of heating it up!
137400: The fire's not even lit - besides I'm not sure a ceramic bowl is the
best sort of container for cooking porridge in. There must be some other way of
heating it up!
137516: I put the pork chops on the hearth. Wow, they defrosted quickly!
137572: The fire is far too hot to go poking around in there! D'you want me to
burn my fingers or something?
137644: I fish around in the embers until I find an old brass key. What a
ridiculous place to keep it! I pick it up in case it comes in useful.
137740: The thick gardening gloves protect my hands as I poke through the fire.
Hey, there's an old brass key among the embers! What a ridiculous place to keep
it. I pick it up in case it comes in useful.
137880: I don't see much point in going around with my hands full of ash. It
might be worth taking a closer look, though...
137964: I don't see much point in going around with my hands full of ash.
138016: It's an olde worlde pine number. Looks like it's seen quite a bit of
use over the years.
138092: An earthenware bowl with the word "GRAMPA" glazed on it. It's bigger
than the large and medium bowls put together.
138180: Mmmmm! That porridge tasted JUST RIGHT! I feel thoroughly invigourated;
in fact I could toss a few cabers myself if you know what I mean. Wait, that
sounded really dodgy. Forget I said it.
138328: Large, granite flagstones cover the kitchen floor.
138364: My first impression upon entering the entrance hall of the Three Bears'
cottage is of hundreds of eyes staring glassily down at me from every corner.
Virtually every forest creature from the tiniest shrew to the largest moose is
represented in a macabre collection of hunting trophies. And not just forest
creatures either; I'd swear that some of these heads are human! On one wall is
a full length portrait of the bear clan. A narrow staircase leads upwards, and
there are doors to the north and west. Completing the morbid ambiance is a
motheaten bearskin rug.
138756: I'm in the entrance hall of the Three Bears' house. Hung around the
walls are portraits of various members of the Bear clan, along with some highly
disturbing hunting trophies. A narrow staircase leads up to the bears' bedroom.
138920: Completing the morbid ambiance is a motheaten bearskin rug.
138964: The trapdoor is open but has been hidden under the bearskin rug.
139008: The trapdoor is closed and has been covered over with the bearskin rug.
139060: Just inside the front door is an open trapdoor.
139096: Just inside the front door is a closed trapdoor.
139130: As I move out onto the porch a draught from somewhere blows the door
shut behind me!
139196: No, thank you very much! The stairs have gone and the cellar is
completely flooded with boiling porridge!
139276: A slightly motheaten pelt with wildly staring glass eyes, previously
worn by Grampa bear I presume. Waste not want not, I suppose, but kind of icky
all the same. Someone has rather creatively shaved the word 'welcome' on his
back. I wonder if they waited until after he was dead...?
139480: Okay, I placed the rug over the trapdoor, so that it looks exactly as
before.
139536: Okay, I placed the rug over the trapdoor, so that it looks exactly as
before - except that the trapdoor is open!
139640: wow, there's a trapdoor hidden underneath the rug! What a stupid place
to put it - right in front of the front door. Someone could have a nasty
accident if they didn't know it was there!
139776: The trapdoor is open and has been covered over with the bearskin rug.
139824: The trapdoor is closed and has been covered over with the bearskin rug.
139876: The trapdoor is open. Steps lead down into darkness.
139928: I can't open it while it's under the rug!
139988: I open the trapdoor. A set of rickety wooden stairs lead down into
darkness.
140046: One wall is dominated by a rather amateurish painting of the Three
Bears signed by Mama Bear herself. I can't see her winning the Turner Prize
anytime soon! The rest are portraits of more distant members of the bear clan,
including Grampa Bear and Grandma Bear. I guess even the three bears have
forbears!

That's odd; for some reason Papa Bear is only wearing one sock.
140320: On one of the walls there are several animal heads mounted on wooden
plaques. It's hard to tell given the appalling quality of the taxidermy job,
but I'd swear that some of these heads were once human. No cuddly teddy bears,
these three!
140492: There's a notice pinned to the front door, and a doorbell fixed to the
frame.
140548: The front door has been wedged open.
140576: The front door is open, but a strong draught threatens to blow it shut
at any moment.
140636: I don't have anything to unlock the front door with!
140676: I open the door a tiny crack. As I do so, the mangy looking wolf I
encountered on the path barges into the hall, his beady eyes darting this way
and that.
140784: He notices the open trapdoor just in time and deftly sidesteps it.
140832: Unfortunately he fails to notice the open trapdoor concealed under the
rug and falls headlong into the cellar with a loud crash. Moments later he
re-emerges looking meaner than ever.
140958: 'I'm going to eat you little piggies!' he snarls. 'Don't worry, it
won't hurt a bit.' Then he notices me and his expression turns to one of
bewilderment. 'My dear girl,' he says 'we really must stop meeting like this.
It is not you I seek, but the Three Little Pigs. I waited
141168: for Little Red Riding Hood, after devouring her grandmother who was
exceedingly tough and chewy and quite frankly I have had enough of the taste of
humans. Go tell those snivelling pigs it's breakfast time!!'
141320: Unfortunately the door locked automatically when it blew shut.
141364: I can't seem to open the door. The bears must have locked it when they
went out. How inconsiderate of them!
141440: I'd look pretty silly knocking on an open door.
141474: After a few moments the Big Bad Wolf answers the door. He takes one
look at me, says 'Not today, thankyou.' and slams it in my face. Fortunately I
have a size 7 Doc Marten wedged firmly in the gap, and after a brief struggle
I'm safely back inside.
'Really,' says the wolf, 'what
141854: knock knock!' Who's there? No-one. No-one who? Just no-one, it seems.
141912: The front door is open. It creaks slightly in the draught.
141956: I'm in the pantry, a small claustrophobic room which smells faintly of
cinammon, honey and the mouse droppings that are liberally sprinkled across the
tiled floor. There is an upright freezer in the corner and some sturdy shelves
stacked high with box after box of McScottie's porridge oats. The kitchen lies
to the south.
142180: If it wasn't for the mouse droppings it would smell quite pleasant in
here.
142300: It's big, it's white, it's rectangular, it freezes things.
142348: The freezer is not exactly what you'd call well stocked - in fact it's
empty.
142404: It doesn't have a plug. Maybe it's gas-powered.
142440: won't fit in the freezer. There must be another way of cooling the
porridge down!
142504: There are three pork chops in the packet. Why am I not surprised?
142556: One of the bears is obviously into DIY.
142588: The bears must spend a fortune on porridge oats - there must be three
hundred cartons here! I wonder if they save the coupons?
142676: I can't see much point in loading myself up with cartons of porridge.
All the cartons are pretty much the same, and what's more they all seem to be
empty. These bears must have a hell of a mouse problem!
142820: One of the cartons has the words "FREE GIFT" splashed all over the side
of it, so I grab that one. I always was a sucker for those little plastic
gizmos. The carton is surprisingly light.
142964: "McScottie's Porridge Oats - Fortified with 6 vitamins and anabolic
steroids. They'll make a wee man of ye!" There's a picture of a man in a kilt
tossing the haggis or whatever it is they do, and the words "FREE GIFT INSIDE!"
emblazoned across the bottom. The carton is suspiciously light.
143184: There is a plastic pendant at the bottom of the carton, but it is
otherwise empty.
143248: It's a plastic pendant in the shape of a bat. It has a string so I can
put it around my neck.
143316: The pendant stops glowing the moment I take it off.
143352: Oh wow! As soon as I put it on it becomes a glow-in-the-dark pendant!
How cool is that?
143424: I think I'll leave them in there until I need them, otherwise I'll only
lose them.
143484: I take a match from the box and strike it. The match flares briefly...
143536: I take a match from the box and strike it. The match flares briefly,
and then goes out.
143604: A simple little gadget designed to deliver swift and painless death to
harmless little rodents.
143672: There's a dead mouse in it right now. He seems to have been lured there
by a large wedge of cheese.
143744: The mousetrap is baited with a large wedge of cheese.
143784: The trap still contains a dead mouse.
143812: There's no need to put anything back in the mousetrap.
143852: Over in the corner of the pantry, underneath the shelves is a
mousetrap.
143908: Rigour mortis seems to have set in. Poor little blighter; he never
stood a chance!
143968: If the dead mouse has any thoughts on that subject, he elects to keep
them to himself.
144030: he's a jolly little chap, isn't he?' Says my Fairy Godmother as I hand
over the dead mouse. With a wave of her magic wand she transforms it into a
dead coach horse. She seems perfectly satisfied with this outcome. 'Now, child,
that's the transport sorted out. Now for the other thing. What was it now...?'
144254: no, no dear,' says my Fairy Godmother. 'We must do things in the right
order. First we need a coach for the horses to pull. I'll need one of those
things, those orange things; a kumquat! No, that's not right...'
144416: It's stale and hard as a rock!
144440: Okay, I removed the wedge of cheese that was holding the door open.
144488: There's no point in wedging it shut!
144516: Okay, I wedged the door open with the stale cheese.
144556: Yuck. No thanks - it's gone all hard and rubbery.
144596: It's currently wedged under the front door.
144632: I'd rather not touch them, thankyou!
144664: The floor of the pantry is covered in terracotta tiles.
144704: I'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a
thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a fairy tale,
funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign designed to deter
trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A little path lined by rows
of white-painted stones leads around the side of the house to the west.
145136: A large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What
it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there are
trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme going. A clearly
marked path leads south and west, whilst in every other direction are, well,
trees.
145356: I'm pretty sure that's the direction I came from when I entered the
forest, so let's go a different way.
145436: Just a fallen tree. It doesn't have much to say for itself.
145482: Bye-Laws and Regulations

NO FISHING
NO HUNTING
NO TRESPASSING IN
STRANGE LITTLE COTTAGES
DO NOT STRAY FROM THE PATHS
(Unless you want to get
seriously lost, that is!)

DO NOT FEED THE WOLVES!
145692: He looks distictly shifty - he'd look more at home on a market stall in
Hackney Wick than wandering around an enchanted forest.
145784: An old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.
145828: 'I've been on me feet all day, love. It's murder on me bunions! Want to
buy some magic beans? Only one cow a packet!'
145922: Beans, love. Only the very best - imported from darkest Peru. Only one
cow a packet!'
145990: that's right love, just one cow for a whole packet. Bargain.'
146038: lots of wolves around here, love. Got to be careful, you have. Nearly
got eaten by one myself, I did. But see, I'm clever. Canny. Outsmarted him,
love. They're none too bright, your average wolf.'
146190: you can take 'em or leave 'em as far as I'm concerned. Want to buy some
beans? Going cheap. Down to one cow from one and a half.'
146286: do you know what? I hadn't even noticed them. Want to buy some beans?'
146342: it's a well known fact that Mama bear is having a fling with the
milkman. The only person in the forest who doesn't know is Papa bear, poor
sod.'
146450: stick to the paths, love, unless you want to get hoplessly lost and
wander around in circles for ages. There's wolves and all sorts lurking in
there.'
146558: that's right love, just one cow for a whole packet. Bargain.'
146606: it's a reasonably comfortable log. I've had better. I'd rate it about a
six out of ten. Come and try it if you like.'
146694: there's three bears living in a cottage just down the road from here. I
don't hold with it, myself, bears living in houses. It'll be pigs next, and
before you know it, there goes the neighbourhood.'
146838: that's right love, magic, they are. Not your ordinary beans, these.'
146894: been peddling my wares here for years, I have. You don't half see some
strange things here, mind. Not half an hour ago I saw a wolf wearing a lady's
nightgown.'
147014: they're marvellous, your Royal Family. They do such a lot for the
country. Couldn't tell you exactly what, but whatever it is they do, they do a
lot of it. Or so they'd have us believe.'
147152: 'I wouldn't know about that. I don't get invited to those sort of
things. I just read about 'em afterwards in Hail! magazine.'
147296: I'd rather not, thankyou.
147320: I don't think this guy's planning to take a holiday, so it must be
where he keeps his wares.
147392: It's a packet of magic beans. There are some instructions written on
the back of the packet.
147462: for a giant beanstalk, plant bean in a sunny spot and water well. As a
cure for non-rabbit-head-itis, take one bean daily, preferably with a meal. If
symptoms persist, consult your local wizard. BEST BEFORE: MARCH 1976'
147636: Looks just like an ordinary bean. It had better be magic, or that
pedlar's dead meat!
147700: Maybe I should plant it somewhere first.
147730: Okay, I watered the magic bean. After a few moments there is a low
rumble from underground. The ground begins to shake violently...

   Aaah!
Something shot out of the ground and knocked me flying! I'm lying spreadeagled
on the ground beneath this MASSIVE beanstalk! Well, I say massive, actually it
stops abruptly just above the roof of the cottage.

Damn, I seem to have
dropped all my stuff...
148024: This is probably not the best place to be growing vegetables.
148068: Wouldn't it be better to plant it in the vegetable plot?
148108: What, with my bare hands? I just got these nails done!
148148: Okay, I planted it in the vegetable plot. Nothing seems to be
happening. So much for the "magic."
148222: you bring me a cow, love and I'll give you some beans. No cow, no
beans, no deal, savvy?'
148288: I have a feeling that non-rabbit-head-itis is an affliction that mainly
affects rabbits. I'm not sure what kind of effect the bean would have on a
human being. Are you sure you want me to go through with this?
148436: Oh great. It worked. I'm completely cured of non-rabbit-head-itis,
which means, in other words, that I now have the head of a rabbit. Thanks.
148544: Apart from the fact that I now have the head of a bunny rabbit, I'm
still pretty darn sexy.
148612: I'm about 5' 10", 19 years old with stripey tights and Doc Martens, and
I'm named after my really cool strawberry blonde dreadlocks. Basically I'm a
Fox, but you knew that already.
148748: I'm about 5' 10", 19 years old and, thanks to you, completely naked
except for a pair of Doc Martens.
148828: Uh-oh. I really screwed up this time!
148856: Sorry, what was that you said? I'm having trouble concentrating...
148908: What, with my bare hands? I just got these nails done!
148948: I really don't think this is a good place to do that!
148988: Okay, I dug a little hole in the ground with the trowel, but found
nothing.
149044: I'm not carrying any paint, dumb-ass!
149072: What, with my fingers? I gave up all that stuff when I left primary
school!
149128: I'm not going around painting anything and everything gold! Do I look
like Lawrence Lewellyn-Bowen?
149204: I'm sorry, I don't know how to do that without matches. I was in the
girl scouts, but they kicked me out after two weeks.
149292: would burn so well! Uh-oh; the flames are spreading like wildfire - I
burned down the cottage, the entire forest and everything in it, including me.
That'll teach me to play with matches!!
149432: I can hardly keep my eyes open...
149464: I give it a good strike, smashing the crystal. It's now stopped at
149512: . Weird; time seems to have stopped somehow.
149552: It's the latest in charity shop chic. Okay, so the hemline used to be a
little bit lower. I got a bit scissor-happy, okay?
149640: Cinderella's Fairy Godmother already took care of that!
149680: Oh, yeah, sure. Look, I'm not that kind of girl, okay? Despite what
people say.
149744: Black and tangerine stripes. Way cool.
149772: I'm not wearing any, thanks to that stupid wand!
149808: I am not going to stand here performing a striptease for your benefit!
149856: Ten-eyelet D.M.s. A bit scuffed and covered in paint splashes.
Tangerine laces to go with my tights.
149932: Strawberry blonde dreadlocks, shaved at the sides and festooned with
ribbons and beads. I look incredibly cool; that's all you really need to know!
150036: It's still thumping away inside my head like a bass drum.
150076: From its floral carpet to its lovingly dusted knick-knacks, The Three
Bears' sitting room is a chintzy abomination of taste, the sort of room that
would make any sane bear want to go back and live in a cave.
150224: Three chairs are arranged around a small coffee table; a large chair, a
medium-sized chair and a tiny little chair.
150308: Two chairs are arranged around a small coffee table; a medium-sized
chair and a tiny little chair. Don't ask me where the other one went.
150408: Two chairs are arranged around small coffee table; a large chair and a
medium-sized chair. There used to be a tiny little chair but I'd rather not
talk about it.
150524: The medium-sized chair is sitting on its own by the coffee table,
looking sorry for itself. This chair business is getting ridiculous!
150620: There's a low-pitched hum coming from somewhere.
150656: The humming noise is very faint and I can't quite tell where it's
coming from. It could be from underground.
150736: The low hum is definately coming from the direction of the large chair!
150788: The humming noise is very faint and I can't quite tell where it's
coming from. It could be from underground.
151116: It's a huge overstuffed leather affair covered with leather buttons. It
looks well worn, as though the person it belongs to has nothing better to do
than sit on a horrible hard chair all day.
151248: As if it wasn't uncomfortable enough already, the chair is fitted with
electrodes!
151308: A filthy antimacassar is draped over the back of the chair.
151350: One of the buttons on the arm looks slightly different from the
others...
151408: It's mounted on some sort of piston like mechanism that moves it up and
down between here and the sitting room. Looks like Papa Bear went to a lot of
trouble to keep this little hideaway a secret from the rest of the family!
There's a small red button on one of the arms.
151596: Whoa! A hole just opened up in the floor and the chair is carrying me
down into the bowels of the earth! It's just like something out of a James Bond
film!

   Ouch! - it's stopped...
151734: The jolt threw me out of the chair - I guess the mechanism was designed
for someone much heavier than me!
151816: Whoa! A hole opened up in the floor and the chair just disappeared into
it like something out of a James Bond film! Then the hole closed up again. I
think I may have made a mistake there. Maybe I should have been
151968: The chair shoots back up through a hole carved in the roof of the cave,
carrying me with it. The hole in the sitting room floor closes behind it.
152068: The chair shoots up through a hole carved in the roof of the cave and
disappears from sight. Oh crap - I think I was supposed to have been
152166: I give the handle a good hard yank. There's a whirring sound from down
below and suddenly the floor opens up and the big hard chair shoots back into
it's original position. Whew!

The panel is now somewhere under the chair and
impossible to get at.
152344: The second I plump myself down on the large chair I go into convulsions
as 240 volts sear through my body! The room is filled with an odour reminscent
of barbequed ribs. When the bears come home they find my blackened skeleton
grinning at them from the armchair...
152532: Bloody hell! This has got to be the hardest chair I've ever sat in!
I've only been here two seconds and my buttocks are as numb as a pair of frozen
fishcakes!
152648: A nasty, frilly lacy thing that old people drape over the backs of
chairs for no good reason. It's old and grubby and is embroidered with the
initials P.B. There's something underneath it...
152784: A nasty, frilly lacy thing that old people drape over the backs of
chairs for no good reason. It's old and grubby and is embroidered with the
initials P.B.

Let's just chuck it away, shall we?
152924: Bloody hell! There are electrodes concealed underneath it! Papa Bear
must be a little tetchy about other people using his chair - he's wired it up
to the mains! There's a cable connected to the electrodes which presumably
supplies the juice.
153100: It's a disgusting shade of pink with orange flowers but it looks really
comfortable! If someone really heavy sat on that they'd sink without trace!
153204: I stuck my hand down the back of the chair cushions looking for loose
change. There's so much cushioning on the chair that my arm kept going and
going until it was in right up to the shoulder and I still didn't find the
bottom of it!
153364: Wow - this chair is sooooo soft! I feel as though I'm sinking into a
black hole! Oh my god, I am!
153436: Wow - this chair is soooo soft it's unbelievable! A little too soft!
Lucky I'm so light or I'd sink right into it.
153524: Are you trying to make me feel guilty or something? It was just a
stupid chair! I'll buy them another one, okay?
153604: A small self-assembly chair of Swedish design that evokes the
wholesome, healthy lifestyle of the Scandinavian people. On the bottom it says
'Made in China.'
153720: What tiny little chair? I trashed it, remember? Duh!
153760: Wow, this chair feels just right! Oh, crap!! The stupid thing collapsed
right under me! I guess that's what happens if you buy self-assembly.
153868: Whereas all the other buttons look like part of the upholstery, this
one is bright red and has the word "activate" written on it!
153960: From where I'm sitting, I can't reach the button on the arm of the
large chair.
154020: I press the button, but the chair doesn't move. Instead there's a nasty
whirring and spluttering noise from the chair mechanism! Some of the porridge
must have gotten into the works.
154148: Hmm, perhaps I should sit on the chair first, I don't want to get left
behind!
154252: I would, but unfortunately it's on the arm of that chair which is up in
the sitting room!
154316: I would press the button, but it was on the arm of the large chair
which seems to have done a disappearing act!
154392: Unfortunately it's on the arm of that chair which is up in the sitting
room!
154448: It was on the arm of the large chair which seems to have done a
disappearing act!
154508: In keeping with the rustic feel of the cottage, the coffee table has
been 'antiqued' with some sort of special paint effect. In fact it just looks
like somebody painted it with their eyes closed.
154648: All the latest gossip on the Fairyland royal family. Let's see; "Who's
going to be at the Royal Ball?" Hmm. "How to get the Rapunzel look." Ho hum.
Wait, what's this; "It's the latest craze that's sweeping the nation - the
must-have toy that every
154840: princess won't want to be without. Golden Balls have become the
bestselling plaything at Geppetto's toy superstore..." Oh, please - what's a
princess going to do with a ball made of solid gold - she'd only drop it in a
pond or something!
155016: There's a small hinged panel set into the floor close to where the
large chair used to be...
155084: I see nothing particularly special about the carpet, besides that it's
so hideous it hurts my eyes to look at it.
155168: Oh, you know, the usual things - glass animals, plaster models of
peeing cherubs; the sort of things I would take to a car-boot sale rather than
bring back from one. They're of no interest to me.
155312: Really, they're of no interest to me. Whatsoever. At all.
155360: It's set into the floor where the large chair used to be. The small
hinged panel is
155452: I open the panel to reveal a small red handle. The handle is stencilled
with the words 'EMERGENCY CHAIR RECOVERY DEVICE.'
155560: It has the words 'EMERGENCY CHAIR RECOVERY DEVICE' stencilled on it.
155628: I give the handle a good hard yank. But nothing happens. I think I must
have turned the power off.
155700: I seem to have sunk deep within the soft, enveloping folds of the
medium-sized chair, the place where biscuit crumbs, loose change and other lost
items normally accumulate. I can just see a small window of light, the only way
out of this warm, stifling floral-print cocoon.
155892: I can't move! Something I'm carrying keeps dragging me back into the
chair! I don't know how Mama Bear puts up with this!!
155988: Everything looks much LARGER through these.
156024: I'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be
quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint it gold.
156128: Just south of me is the clearing in the forest.
156236: Okay, I filled the bottle with water from the pond.
156276: Okay, I filled the bottle with water from the pond. Yeeurrggh! My hand
is covered in pondslime now! Thanks a lot!
156370: snookums, three pints tomorrow please - one regular, one skimmed and
one semi-skimmed. From your little Fuzzy-wuzzy'
156460: It's pinned to the door with unremovable pins. Just in case you were
thinking of removing it.
156528: No matter what I do, the notice won't come off the door. What the hell
am I going to do with it, anyway? Sell it?
156612: "Gone for a walk in the forest while our porridge cools down. Back at
noon sharp. Don't even think about breaking in here while we're out. Signed:
The Three Bears."
156736: An environmentally sound way of disposing of all the objects I'm
finished with.
156792: A battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.
156836: It's a small brass button mounted at the side of the door, that rings a
bell inside the house to let the people inside know that someone is waiting on
the doorstep. A simple concept, but amazingly effective.
156980: I'd look pretty silly ringing the bell when the door's open.
157026: ding-dong!' A bell rings somewhere. But nobody answers. I guess there's
nobody home.
157092: Not only has Papa Bear's secret den been devastated by a nuclear
explosion, but it is also rapidly filling up with porridge which is gushing in
through the ravaged doorway to the west.
157220: The cave has been completely devastated by the explosion! Where the
door used to be there is now a gaping hole in the western wall. The walls of
the cave, melted by the intensive heat of my homemade atomic bomb are still
glowing faintly.
157384: I'm in an underground cave. From the decor I'd say this was Papa Bear's
private den, a place of sanctuary away from the rigours of family life. The
walls are plastered with posters of football teams and pin-ups from 'Playbear.'
A solid metal door, set into the western wall of the cave looks almost
impenetrable. There's an electric socket in the wall next to the door.
157648: A twenty foot pole goes up into a hole carved in the ceiling. It's
attached to some sort of piston mechanism. There's a refridgerator here.
157748: Of the television set there is no sign. The fridge is lying on its
side, smoking slightly.
157812: The large chair is now facing a television set and there's a fridge
within easy reach of the chair.
157884: It's a typical single outlet.
157912: It's located conveniently close to the chair.
157948: Sadly the fridge contained just the one can of beer. It's now empty.
158048: I wish I had some but the nearest offie must be bloody miles away!
158096: There's none left, unfortunately. I've swigged the lot!
158200: There are two buttons, marked "Channel" and "Buy."
158404: I'm not sure if anything happened; it's all static.
158444: Let's not get carried away; one toaster should be enough, I think.
158496: Okay, one toast-o-mastic 3000 atomic 3 - slot toaster ordered!
158620: I press the button but nothing happens, perhaps because the television
has been vapourised. A television-shaped outline on the wall of the cave is all
that remains of it.
158840: The television is plugged into the wall socket.
158876: The television is not plugged in.
158900: I'd love to sit down and catch up with Neighbours, but the television
has been vapourised.
158964: A television-shaped outline on the wall of the cave is all that remains
of it.
159042: today. I wonder why? Could it perhaps be because IT'S NOT PLUGGED IN,
DUMMY?!
159160: I can't - the toaster is plugged in to the only wall socket!
159204: Okay, I put the plug in the wall socket.
159236: Okay, I pulled the plug out of the wall socket.
159324: It's a cookery programme - some old crone in a gingerbread house is
demonstrating how to cook CHILDREN!
159404: It's the Jerry Springer Show - this week: My Stepdaughter is living in
the forest with seven little men...
159484: It's the Fairyland Shopping Channel - "Tired of porridge every morning?
Sounds like you need toast-o-mastic 1000 atomic three - slot toaster! Toast
three pieces of bread simultaneously on three different settings! Never again
will Dad complain that his toast is under-done or Mum that her toast is
burnt... and for baby of course it's always just right! Press BUY now to make
your purchase!"
159768: It's the Fairyland News Channel - "This just in... Prince Charming of
Fairyland has been turned into a frog. A Palace spokesperson today confirmed
that the transformation took place late last night after a run-in between the
Prince and a wicked witch. Police are holding a local crone for questioning in
connection with the incident. The whereabouts of the Prince are as yet unknown,
but he was last seen hopping towards the Enchanted Forest..."
160132: The door looks as though it has been designed to withstand anything
short of a nuclear blast! There's a sign on the door which reads "Papa Bear's
workshop - STRICTLY NO ADMITTANCE to anyone other than Papa Bear!" Just next to
the door at floor level is an electric socket.
160340: The solid metal door has no doorhandle or keyhole and there is no other
visible means of opening it. The secret is known only to Papa Bear!
160440: That might work, but I'd need to find some way of detonating them at a
distance. I don't want to end up as crimson wallpaper.
160536: Not much left of those now, I'm afraid!
160566: Forget it, pervert! For one thing, I'm not a bear and for another I'm
not that way inclined!
Hel-lo - look at the knockers on that one!
160720: From the decor I'd say this was Papa Bear's private den, a place of
sanctuary away from the rigours of family life. There's an electric socket in
the wall next to the metal door.
160852: There's a small, mottled indentation in the wall which might once have
been the electric socket, but it's hard to be sure...
160940: For plugging electrical appliances into. I believe it's known as an
160988: The toaster is currently plugged into the wall socket.
161028: The television is currently plugged into the wall socket.
161102: deep well in the floor, raises and lowers the chair which sits atop a
twenty foot pole. The chair is currently up in the sitting room, and there
doesn't appear to be any way of getting it back!
161352: I try desperately to shin up the pole, but it's so greasy I keep
sliding down!
161408: I'm perched precariously on the roof of the cottage, trying desperately
not to look down.
161472: There's an awful lot of smoke coming out of the chimney. Attached to it
161562: aerial. It kind of spoils the chocolate box look of the place if you
know what I mean. The top of the beanstalk can be seen poking up above the
roofline.
161672: Okay... I hurled myself into the top branches of the beanstalk. It
swayed around a bit but I managed to cling on.
161756: I'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot
in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat
neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping
but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle
potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north,
an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow.
162048: A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot and stops abruptly
just above the level of the roof.
162124: A bunch of leaves are sticking out of the vegetable plot.
162164: It's in a sunny spot by the side of the cottage.
162200: It's in a sunny spot by the side of the cottage. There's a bunch of
leaves sticking out of the ground there; weird!
162288: It's a little on the squishy side - no good even for making jack o'
lanterns now.
162348: I think I'll pass on that, thankyou.
162378: thankyou dear,' says my Fairy Godmother as I hand her the pumpkin.
'With a wave of my wand I shall transform this pumpkin into a lovely golden
coach. Now let me see...' She takes out her wand and waves it over the pumpkin
a couple of times, somewhat uncertainly. After a short time the pumpkin begins
to swell as though someone were pumping it full of air. Then there is a soft,
damp 'plop' as the pumpkin explodes, showering the two of us with orange goo.
 
 'Oh dear,' says my Fairy Godmother 'that wasn't quite right! Never mind, we'll
have to make do without a coach. Perhaps you can ride one of the coach
horses...'
162824: Just sticking out of the ground. Wacky. I wonder who put them there.
162876: I take hold of the leaves and give them a good yank. Something pops out
of the ground in a great shower of earth! There seems to be some kinda root
vegetable actually attached to the leaves. Weird; I always thought these things
came from tins!
163052: The Three Bears' attempt at a 'water feature' is rather small and
choked with pond weed.
163116: The Three Bears' attempt at a 'water feature' is rather small and
choked with pond weed. I think I see something small and green moving below the
surface!
163272: Right idea, I think - just wrong kind of ball.
163308: The ball lands in the pond with a dull plop. A few moments later a
small green frog emerges from the pond clutching it in one of his slimy
flippers. He drops it on the grass in front of me and puckers up expectantly...
163460: The ball lands in the pond with a dull plop and sinks without a trace.
Were you hoping for another frog? What was wrong with the first one?
163632: Two things: One; the pond is only two feet deep. Two; I'm not swimming
in a murky bloody pond. Okay?
163716: It leads into a small meadow bounded by a rickety fence.
163756: I'm not the Three Bears' gardener you know! Do I look like Alan
Titchmarsh?
163816: I don't have anything to do it with, and even if I did I wouldn't do
it. I'm not the Three Bears' gardener, you know!
163904: I'm in a dingy cellar with bare brick walls and the musty smell of a
laundry room. There is an old upright washing machine in the corner and a
fusebox on the wall. Steps lead up to the trapdoor in the ceiling.
164052: There's a gothic archway leading out of the cellar to the west. A
battered old wardrobe stands close to the archway.
164136: A battered old wardrobe stands against the western wall of the cellar.
164184: The room is rapidly filling up with boiling-hot porridge. The washing
machine and the wardrobe are already half submerged!
164272: Smells like washing left for too long in the machine.
164310: I scramble up the rickety steps just in time - a moment later the lower
part of the staircase is smashed to splinters by a wave of bubbling porridge. I
look back to see the cellar completely submerged in boiling oatmeal.
164472: An old wooden wardrobe with brass handles that looks like it's seen
better days. Probably why it's in the cellar.
164552: There's a gentle breeze coming from behind the wardrobe!
164592: There's a dark opening behind the wardrobe from which a gentle breeze
is wafting. I'd have to move the wardrobe in order to investigate further.
164692: Urrggh! It's too heavy for me to move!
164724: Okay.... Oof! I moved it. Oh, wow! There's a gothic archway behind here
leading into some kind of hidden room! The words 'Baby Bear's Playroom' are
painted above the arch!
164856: Okay, I shoved the wardrobe back to where it was.
164896: Property of Papa Bear, no doubt.
164924: Whoa! The extra weight is making me sink further into the soft chair! I
feel like I'm being sucked into a black hole!
165008: Who do you think I am? Charles Atlas?
165040: Normally I could just about lift those, but I'm so weak with hunger at
the moment I doubt I could bench press a feather duster. You expect me to lift
weights after eating one measly little bowl of porridge? I'm still
165196: Normally I could just about lift those, but I'm so weak with hunger at
the moment I doubt I could bench press a feather duster. When am I going to get
my bloomin' breakfast?
165324: There is a volt meter inside, and two switches marked A and B.
165370: Down in the cave the toaster elements heat up igniting the fuses on the
sticks of dynamite...

   ...which explode causing a chain reaction...
165478: The toaster's atomic batteries go into meltdown resulting in a NUCLEAR
EXPLOSION which rocks the whole cottage!
165570: "SPROING!!!" I hear the distant sound of a toaster popping up!
165636: There's a needle indicating how much power is stored in the cottage's
batteries. The volt meter is
165712: It doesn't seem to have been used in a while, probably because it's
missing it's motor.
165776: The machine's door is hanging off its hinges.
165812: It doesn't work - someone's removed the motor. I guess the bears will
be doing their laundry in the pond from now on. Yeeuch!
165904: The door is broken; it won't shut properly now.
165940: I use the wrench on the handle of the door and twist it as hard as I
can. There is a sharp CRACK as the catch snaps off and the door flies open! Who
was it said that brute force never achieved anything?

However, the washing
machine contains nothing but sludge.
166126: I jam the poker in the door of the machine and give it a good hard
push. There is a sharp crack and the door flies open!  Who was it said that
brute force never achieved anything?

However, the washing machine contains
nothing but sludge.
166296: The door of the washing machine is jammed shut! Don't you just hate it
when that happens?
166364: Hidden in the sludge at the bottom of the drum, I find a small key,
which I take.
166428: There's nothing very much I can say about it except that it's tiny,
metal, and a key.
166496: Strange thing to find in the cellar of a country cottage! It leads west
into another part of the cellar. The words 'Baby Bear's Playroom' are painted
above the arch.
166616: I'm in a dark passage carved into the rock. It curves around to the
north.
166672: A raging torrent of red-hot porridge is pouring in from the direction
of the cellar!
166732: This seems to be a small annex to the main part of the cellar.
Everything about the decor of this place says 'dungeon' to me, from the
guttering torches to the ragrolled paint effect on the walls that's meant to
look like ancient stonework. Unfortunately the rotting skeleton manacled to the
wall is only too real. A sign on the wall opposite the skeleton says 'When we
say NO TRESPASSERS we mean NO TRESPASSERS!' Something for the bears' victims to
think about while they languish in this dump. The passage leads south back to
the cellar.
167124: A raging torrent of boiling-hot porridge is pouring in through the
entrance to the south!
167192: The manacles are attached to heavy iron chains that are bolted to the
wall.
167244: I think it's a little late for that! Let's just leave her where she is,
shall we?
167308: They're firmly screwed into the wall.
167340: It's wearing a red cape with a hood. I guess this must be the elusive
Little Red Riding Hood! No wonder she never made it to Grandma's house - she
must have called at the wrong cottage by mistake, poor little twerp! It's a
rather chilling reminder of what's likely to happen to me if those bears find
me here!
167560: It's wearing a red cape with a hood. I guess this must be the elusive
Little Red Riding Hood! No wonder she never made it to Grandma's house - she
must have called at the wrong cottage by mistake, poor little twerp!
   Hmm,
what's this? There appears to be a blackened metal poker shoved up her, um,
actually you don't want to know where it was shoved. Ouch.

I've taken the
poker in case it comes in useful.
167860: Not my idea of a fashion statement, but at least now she's thin enough
to be a supermodel.
167928: Installing a dungeon in your basement is one thing, decorating it to
look medieval takes an altogether sicker kind of bunny.
168020: It leads west back into the cellar.
168052: On closer inspection the torches appear to be electric, powered by
those flickery lightbulbs. They seem to be there purely for effect as they give
out very little light.
168168: On closer inspection the torches appear to be electric, powered by
those flickery lightbulbs. They're not even switched on right now.
168324: I'm in the Three Bears' bedroom, a small attic room with steeply
sloping walls. They have the weirdest sleeping arrangements. There's a tiny
little bed, a medium-sized bed and
168452: . A narrow staircase leads down to the hall.
168484: The Big Bad Wolf reaches the top of the stairs and looks around
disdainfully at the Three Bears' bedroom.
168644: Ooh, what a sweet 'ickle bed! It looks just big enough for 'ickle ole'
me, but somebody got there first! It's that lazy cow Sleeping Beauty! There's
no way I'm snuggling up next to that bimbo!
168860: I'm not snuggling up next to her! There's not enough room, for one
thing, and she snores, for another!
168988: yet. Filling the cellar with boiling hot porridge was a stroke of
genius, but don't you think we ought to find some way of making sure those
bears don't find the trap I set? I don't want to end up like Little Red Riding
Hood!
169148: I drift off to sleep. While my watch says it's just
169218: The tiny little bed is so comfortable that I fall into a deep sleep the
instant my head hits the pillow. Not even the muffled cry as the Three Bears
fall through the trapdoor into the cellar and drown in a mire of their own
porridge can rouse me from my sleep.
  At just after noon I have a strange
dream. Three ghostly bears, each with a pair of wings and holding a golden
harp, float up through the bedroom floorboards. Papa Bear hovers above me like
a translucent bear-shaped cloud, glaring at me through baleful yellow eyes.
 
'Who's been sleeping in my bed?' he growls, his hot, stinky breath on my face.

 'Who's been sleeping in my bed?' snarls Mama Bear nudging her husband out of
the way.
  'Mater, Pater,' says Baby Bear who has obviously had the benefit of
a public school education, 'it's patently obvious who has been sleeping in our
beds, eating our porridge and destroying our furniture, since the shameless
hussy is still sprawled across my cot. But it's all academic now - we're dead!
The little monster got the better of us this time! Come, parents, I hear that
heaven is full of succulent young ladies such as this and that the clouds are
made of porridge!' With that the Three Bears float up through the ceiling and
on to paradise.

A few moments later, they're back again, wingless now and
dropping like stones towards the fires of hell. The last I hear of them is the
anguished cry
170212: bedtime yet. Covering the open trapdoor with the rug was pretty clever,
but I think it would take more than just a fall down the stairs to stop the
Three Bears! If only there were something we could do to ensure they
170416: Knackered though I am, I don't think I should go to bed just yet. If
I'm still asleep when those bears come home from their morning stroll, I'm
going to end up as an appetiser on their lunch menu! There must be some way of
making sure they don't find me here!
170608: It affords a view of the clearing in front of the house.
170664: painted shut and doesn't look as though it's been opened in years.
There's a tiny point of light flitting about outside the window!
170800: A tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing.
170836: I think that might be a tad excessive, don't you?
170872: I don't see any point in doing that now!
170904: I'm not sure that would be a good idea. I might frighten away that tiny
point of light, whatever it is.
170978: Okay, If you insist.
   I give the window a good hard kick with my Doc
Martens. There is a sharp crack and it flies open, the glass shattering against
the wall of the cottage. The tiny point of light seems to take fright and flits
away across the treetops.
171160: I don't think the window will ever open or close again...
171204: I don't see much point in doing that now!
171672: I've already tried that and it didn't work!
171704: Hmm, there doesn't seem to be anywhere to wedge the poker into. I think
I'd be better off trying to turn that catch!
171788: Even with thick leather gloves on I still can't turn the catch! I'm
going to need something a bit more heavy duty!
171872: Do you want me to break a nail or something?
171904: Generations of careless decorators have repeatedly painted over the
catch making it impossible to turn. No matter how hard I try I can't open it
with my bare hands!
172024: No wonder it was so hard! The "bed" was actually a full sized snooker
table with pockets and everything...
172100: It's very large and very uncomfortable looking, and is covered by a
single rather thin looking blanket. Is this guy some kind of masochist or what?
172204: Let's not go through all that again.
172232: I lie down on the huge "bed" and try to get some sleep, but it's
hopelessly uncomfortable. I'd have better luck sleeping on a flagpole.
172332: It's threadbare and patched in several places, but otherwise quite
uninteresting.
172392: It's threadbare and patched in several places, but otherwise quite
uninteresting.
172452: Wow! Now I understand why the huge bed felt so hard! What better way to
conceal from your wife the fact that you've spent your family's entire annual
porridge budget on a full sized snooker table than to give up your conjugal
rights altogether and disguise it as a bed! Boy, could this couple use some
marriage guidance!
172676: A standard part of your basic snooker table I believe.
172720: Shiny, round and white.
172740: Okay, I painted the cue ball gold.
172772: This thing has so many quilts and eiderdowns piled on it that I fear
the frame will give way under the weight. Mama Bear is heading for some real
back trouble in later life.
172892: Let's not go through all that again.
172920: I lie down on the medium-sized bed and immediately begin to sink into
its suffocating folds. I manage to claw my way out, gasping for breath. There's
no way I'm sleeping in that bed tonight!
173060: The medium-sized bed is heaped with patchwork quilts, fluffy eiderdowns
and so many pillows that Mama Bear must have to sleep sitting up! None of them
is of any interest to me.
173188: The catch turns freely now allowing me to open and close the window.
173236: The window catch is covered in layers of ancient paint and won't turn
at all.
173392: For some unaccountable reason, Sleeping Beauty is lying fast asleep on
the tiny little bed.
173456: I shake her violently and yell in her ear; 'Wakey wakey!' but to no
avail. She murmurs something in her sleep about a kiss, and then resumes
snoring. The lazy cow.
173576: I try to shove the little minx off the bed, but somehow she manages to
cling on even whilst asleep.
173644: Forget it! Once was more than enough, thankyou!
173680: Okay - but this had better work, bozo!

   (I pucker up and give her a
big sloppy kiss on the cheek.)

   Yeuch! That was vile! And it didn't work
either - it looks as though only a kiss from a handsome prince will wake her!
Typical bloody princess - too fussy for her own good if you ask me!
173892: I'm at the top of the beanstalk. I was under the impression that these
giant beanstalks all had castles at the top of them, but not this scrawny
specimen. However I can almost touch the roof of the cottage from here.
174044: Okay... Oof! Fortunately for you I had a soft landing on the thatched
roof of the cottage...
174116: I'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort
where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into
a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.
174354: i didn't know bears had green fingers. In fact I didn't know they had
fingers at all.
174416: The floor is littered with pieces of broken plant pot and the whole
place is festooned with cobwebs.
174484: Plant pots of all sizes are scattered about the shed untidily and the
whole place is festooned with cobwebs.
174740: A pair of pruning clippers, for pruning things I guess. What does
pruning have to do with prunes?
174848: It's a battered old thing with the words 'FISHING TACKLE' crudely
painted on the lid.
174972: I open the trunk. It contains some sticks of dynamite. If this is what
Papa Bear thinks of as fishing tackle I dread to think what he uses for hunting
- a Sherman tank, perhaps?
175104: There are three sticks, each about six inches long and an inch in
diameter. The fuses are extremely short, as though some evil rodent has been
nibbling at them!
175216: I strike a match and light the incredibly short fuse of one of the
sticks of dynamite. It takes perhaps a quarter of a second to burn down.
175314: Bits of me rain down for weeks! As my disembodied spirit floats
heavenward on wings of gossamer it occurs to me that perhaps that was one peice
of advice I shouldn't have followed. I'm a goner and it's all your fault!
175472: The sticks of dynamite are wedged into the toaster slots in such a way
that the fuses are touching the toaster elements.
175560: I've seen more hair on a skinhead but at a pinch it's probably still
serviceable.
175620: The plant pots are piled precariously against the wall of the shed.
175668: I find a trowel and a pair of gardening gloves, which I take.
175712: I can't reach the ones at the top, so I try to pull one out from near
the bottom. Moments later the entire pile is lying all over the floor in
fragments.
175820: A pair of gardening gloves and a trowel are lying among the wreckage.
175868: Now why would I want to do a thing like that?
175900: The plant pots are lying all over the floor in pieces. Whoops.
175944: I don't think a bunch of broken plant pots would be of much use to me.
175996: I seem to have done that already.
176024: It's a thingy for digging little holes in the garden.
176068: They're made of very thick leather, and are about fifteen sizes too big
for me. Hardly surprising, since they probably belong to Papa Bear.
176168: No matter what I do, I can't separate the gloves. Despite not being
physically attached to each other, whatever I do with one instantaneously
happens to the other. It's probably quantum entanglement or something like
that. Live with it.
176336: I put on the gloves, but they're much too big for me and feel just a
little loose!
176400: They're absolutely everywhere. It doesn't look as though this place
gets a lot of use.
176464: This must be where Papa Bear does all his D.I.Y. It's a small but tidy
workshop with a bench and an old filing cabinet in the corner. Pinned to the
walls are what appear to be the blueprints for various devices.
176616: Papa Bear's once tidy workshop is now awash with scalding hot porridge.
The workbench and the old filing cabinet are already half submerged!
176720: It's old and worn, splattered with paint and full of grooves and dents.
176776: Just a wrench that I found on a bench.
176808: All purpose indoor and outdoor 100% waterproof gold paint. It does
exactly what it says on the tin.
176888: A mysterious wooden crate... Looks like Papa Bear does more in his
workshop than simply assemble Ikea furniture.
177028: Sitting in the middle of the floor is a huge wooden crate, stencilled
with the words: "DANGER: PROTOTYPE!"
177116: Nope, there doesn't seem to be any way to open it with a wrench.
177164: Using the poker like a crowbar I wrench the crate apart at the seams.
It collapses to reveal a strange cauldron-like contraption inside.
177260: How? With my bare hands? I just got these nails done you know!
177320: It's a year's warranty for a small self-assembly chair. Looks like it
expired yesterday, what a shame!
177400: It appears to be the operating instructions for a magic porridge pot.
They seem to be fairly straightforward. "To start the pot, say ALAKAZAM. To
stop the pot, say ALAKAZOO." There's a note at the bottom to the effect that
the stop spell is
177640: Detailed diagrams of various things including the mechanism for the
chair, the wind turbine and something described as a "Magic Porridge Pot."
There's some kind of action plan pinned up there too.
177782: Pinned to the wall alongside the blueprints is some sort of to-do list:
178076: I'm on a path winding through the Enchanted Forest. The path winds its
way from the north towards the west. In every other direction there are dark,
sinister looking trees that wave their branches at me in an anthropomorphic
kind of way. Ooh, I'm soooo scared!
178260: As I head off along the path a pathetic, mangey looking wolf jumps out
from behind a bush and slobbers at me in what he probably hopes is a menacing
way.
   'I am the Big Bad Wolf!' says he. Then, after an awkward pause he adds
'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to
Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his
forehead.
   'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I
seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the
forest.
178652: I'm in a small meadow at the back of the cottage, separated from the
forest by a rickety fence. In the middle of the meadow is what appears to be a
homemade wind turbine! To the south, through the tangled pergola, is the
garden.
178834: battery-charging turbine made from wood, old tractor parts and a
washing machine motor, probably connected to the cottage by an underground
cable. Faint wisps of smoke are still issuing from the overheated generator!
179002: battery-charging turbine made from wood, old tractor parts and a
washing machine motor, probably connected to the cottage by an underground
cable. See - I'm not just a pretty face! (Though you have to admit, I am
pretty.) The sails are not currently moving since the air is completely
still.

There is what appears to be an oil can sitting on a platform near the
top of the turbine.
179272: I don't see much point in doing that now!
179304: I could huff and puff until I'm blue in the face and it wouldn't budge
even a single degree!
179372: There's no way I'm going up there! It's a deathtrap!
179412: Even if I could climb up there I wouldn't have the strength to move
those sails!
179476: Presumably it's intended to keep the fearsome forest animals from
getting into the meadow and molesting Daisy, but it doesn't look particularly
effective.
179584: No thanks, I'd only get lost in the forest.
179620: Through the pergola to the south is the garden.
179660: It's a narrow ledge close to the top of the turbine, presumably built
to allow easy access to the machinery.
179740: It's a can of SUPERLUBE oil. Lubricates anything. Anything, you ask?
That's what it says.
179816: I've already done that! Something wrong with your memory?
179860: Okay, a dash of SUPERLUBE and these babies are as good as new!
179912: I've already tried that and it didn't work. Something wrong with your
memory?
179968: Okay, I put a little SUPERLUBE on the window catch; now let's see if
that makes any difference.

   No, nothing doing. I think paint thinner might
have been a better choice; there are just too many old layers of paint on the
catch. If I could just get some leverage I might be able to force it!
180188: I don't see much point in doing that now!
180348: It's out of my reach I'm afraid. Papa Bear must have left it up there
when he built the turbine.
180420: I can't reach it from here! It's all the way up on top of that rickety
structure!
180560: Must be the oddest looking cow I've ever seen! She has four knees! I
strongly suspect that it might be two men in a suit, but it is to all intents
and purposes, a cow.
180680: Daisy the cow is here, gazing at me adoringly through big, brown eyes.
180732: Daisy the cow is standing here, chewing disinterestedly on a mouthful
of hay.
180788: I SAID let's not try that again!!!
180820: The moment I climb onto Daisy's back she begins to buck like a bull in
a rodeo! I'm thrown high into the air and land in an ungraceful heap. Ouch.
Let's not try that again!
180944: It's an interesting idea, but I'd need something to put the milk in!
180996: It's an interesting idea but I don't think Daisy is a real cow.
Otherwise why would the Three Bears need to have their milk delivered?
181092: Daisy moos contentedly and licks my face, seriously smudging my
mascara.
181144: Placing both hands on Daisy's hind quarters I brace myself and shove
her as hard as I can. Daisy moos discontentedly and remains obstinately where
she is.
181252: Daisy jumps up and down excitedly when she sees the turnip. I don't
think I've ever seen a cow do that before!
181332: Daisy gobbles down the turnip excitedly before sidling over to me and
nuzzling my chest. I get impression she thinks I've got more turnips hidden
somewhere about my person. I can't imagine where she gets that idea.
181484: Daisy turns her nose up at the pumpkin. Can't say I blame her - it is a
little bit past its best!
181574: Daisy's back half attempts to dance the tango with her front half.
181624: Daisy begins to gambol and frolic, then seems to realise how silly she
looks and stops abruptly.
181692: Daisy curtsies towards some imaginary audience.
181732: Ah, now there's a lovely specimen!' says the Pedlar, getting up from
his log and feeling Daisy's knees. He seems satisfied. 'all present and
correct! Here you go love - you'll be cured in no time!' He opens his suitcase
and hands me a small packet, then leads Daisy off into the forest.
181940: There are four of them, which is unusual, but they all seem to be in
good working order...
182008: Daisy doesn't look like she's enjoying it much, if the expression on
her face is anything to go by.
182080: I think she's actually smiling at me!
182108: She looks like she's sucking a lemon. That hay she's chewing must taste
pretty bad!
182168: That way seems to be blocked by brambles and other sharp things that
might snag my tights.
182232: That way seems to be blocked by brambles and other sharp things that
I'd rather not walk through in the buff.
182308: I'm lost in the forest, surrounded on all sides by dense foliage. I
knew it was a bad idea to stray from the path! I can go in any direction, but I
haven't a clue which is the right one!
182444: There's an arrow carved into the bark of one particular tree! It's
pointing to the west!
182508: I don't see much point in doing that. Besides, I'd only ladder my
tights!
182564: I'm wandering in the forest lost and completely disorientated!
Everywhere I look there are strange, twisted trees, and what's more they all
look exactly the same! I'm beginning to think it was a really bad idea to leave
the path...
182732: One tree has a branch pointing to the east...
182768: I'm walking in a trackless wilderness of tall, straight trees whose
mighty trunks remind me of the time I got lost among the Axminsters at
CarpetWorld aged six. I can go in just about any direction, but they all look
the same to me.
182936: A cute red squirrel pops out from behind one tree and gestures
northwards with a tiny thumb before scurrying away.
183090: ER." It's a wonder that they managed to find me. In fact it's a wonder
I even managed to order it in the first place considering that the bears don't
have cable!
183212: It's a stylish chrome affair with three slots, each about an inch wide,
and a control lever which can be depressed to activate it. The lever is in the
o
183320: A stick of dynamite has been wedged into each of the slots.
183364: The toaster is plugged into the wall socket.
183396: The dynamite is of more use to me inside the toaster than out!
183440: Okay, I unplugged the toaster before picking it up.
183480: Unfortunately the toaster was completely destroyed in the explosion. I
wonder if nuclear meltdown is covered by the warranty?
183568: Okay, I pulled the plug out of the wall socket.
183648: Okay, I put the plug in the wall socket.
183778: The toaster's atomic batteries go into meltdown resulting in a NUCLEAR
EXPLOSION...

   ...and unfortunately I was standing right next to it at the
time!
183904: ...
"SPROING!!!" The toaster pops up instantly.
183948: The control lever is already pushed down.
183978: Okay, I pushed down the little control lever. Thanks to the toaster's
atomic reactor the elements heat up instantaneously...
184120: Okay, I pushed down the little control lever. The toaster elements heat
up igniting the fuses on the sticks of dynamite...

   ...which explode causing
a chain reaction...
184248: The toaster's atomic batteries go into meltdown resulting in a NUCLEAR
EXPLOSION...

   ...and unfortunately I was standing right next to it at the
time! When the bears come home all they find of me is a shadowy impression on
the wall of the cave.
184436: Okay, I pushed down the little control lever.
184472: Hmmm... they seem to fit quite snuggly. I jammed them in upside down so
that the fuses are touching the heating elements of the toaster.
184568: It activates the toaster. You push it down, the toaster toasts.
Provided it's plugged in and the power's on. The lever is in the
184664: Three slots, each containing a stick of dynamite.
184700: Three slots, each about an inch wide.
184732: "Thankyou for purchasing the toast-o-mastic 3000 atomic 3 - slot
toaster. This revolutionary gadget allows you to toast not one but three slices
of bread at the same time... blah blah blah." There is some smallprint, but it
is illegible to the naked eye.
185396: Through the glasses I can actually read the microscopic print at the
bottom of the page:
   'The Toast-O-Matic 3000 uses a small nuclear reactor for
instantaneous toasting satisfaction. However, the unit still requires
electricty to initiate the reaction. Under normal circumstances there is no
danger of nuclear meltdown. Refer all servicing to a qualified nuclear
physicist. The manufacturers take no responsiblity for injury or death
resulting from the misuse of this product.'
185736: I can't - it's written in the most microscopic type I've ever seen; in
fact I nearly didn't see it. Seems the toaster company really don't want anyone
to read this!
185860: It used to be a small chair. But hey, shit happens.
185900: A small pile of firewood is all that remains of the tiny little chair.
185948: I strike a match and set fire to the remains of Baby Bear's chair...

 
 Alright! There's a blazing fire in the hearth now! And to think they kicked me
out of the Girl Scouts...

   Wow, those pork chops defrosted quickly!
186114: I strike a match and set fire to the remains of Baby Bear's chair...

 
 Alright! There's a blazing fire in the hearth now. Who says I'm not
domesticated? That's only one step away from cooking! And to think they kicked
me out of the Girl Scouts!
186304: Talk about bijou! It's not much bigger than a shoebox. There's a little
chimney on the roof.
186376: It's big and lumpy and covered in mud. Do people actually eat these
things?
186432: I drop the turnip on the ground. It bounces a couple of times and rolls
under Daisy's nose. On seeing this delicious morsel,
186524: Aren't you supposed to cook these things first?
186564: The water is a disgusting shade of green. Eeeuow! I think there's
something swimming in it!
186680: I emptied the water on the ground.
186704: The milkbottle is already full of pondwater.
186740: There's a picture of three little pigs on the packet. Kinda sick when
you think about it. I think I'll become a vegetarian.
186828: No thanks - I've decided to become a vegetarian. Someday.
186876: It's rather small and battered looking.
186908: Aren't these things supposed to lead to castles in the clouds with
giants and stuff? I guess that bean must have been past it's sell-by date, but
then so was the cow I exchanged it for...
187040: If Jack can do it, so can Goldilocks!
187072: It looks just wide enough for me to fit down, but there's an awful lot
of smoke coming out of it right now!
187148: It looks just wide enough for me to fit down.
187180: Okay here goes... Wheee! I slid right down the chimney and out of the
fireplace! That was fun. Can I do it again?
187264: What sort of idiot do you take me for? If I go down there now I'll be
toast!
187320: Okay, okay! If you insist...

   I slide down the chimney and straight
into the roaring fire at the bottom. Aaaaaah! I'm burned to a crisp! I'm
crispier than crispy aromatic duck, but not as aromatic! When the bears come
home they find a blackened skeleton grinning at them from their fireplace.
That's the last time I take your advice, dumbo!
187572: It's pretty useless now!
187592: I can't fill a milkbottle that's in five hundred pieces!
187636: Zhat wazsch pretty good beer! (Burp!) Zschame there weren't any more!
187692: Could be a very expensive dog toy? Or a plaything for an extremely
spoilt princess?
187756: He's all cold and clammy! Is that a little crown he's wearing?
187802: Yeeeuch! Actually he's not a bad smoocher, I've never kissed anyone
before with such a flexible tongue...
   Whoa! There was a flash of light and
the frog just turned into a handsome prince!
187948: thanks, babe,' he says, looking me up and down, 'I'd love to hang
around but I'm off to find me a real princess - I simply must have a date for
the Royal Ball tonight. Maybe we can do lunch sometime!'
188098: Suddenly he notices Sleeping Beauty sprawled across Baby Bear's bed.
'Now that's what I call a REAL princess!' A quick kiss wakes Beauty, and the
happy couple are off to the cathedral. That's no basis for a lasting
relationship!
188270: He runs off towards the forest. I think I preferred him as a frog -
less slimy!
188328: The frog hangs on to his crown with all four flippers and gives me a
particularly dirty look.
188396: It's a huge Heath-Robinson-esque contraption that looks like a cross
between a witch's cauldron and Stevenson's Rocket. The cauldron part is covered
in arcane symbols and looks big enough to boil an elephant!
188548: filled with bubblling, boiling porridge. A sickly odour fills the air.
188608: Sitting amidst the wreckage of the crate is a magic porridge pot.
188656: The magic porridge pot is sitting in the middle of the room.
188700: I don't think using that word again is going to make any difference.
188748: I don't think that doing that again is a terribly good idea. At least,
not in this location. I nearly got killed last time!
188836: Nothing happens. I think that's the spell to
188872: Nothing happens! I think now might be a good time to get the hell out
of here!
188966: Nothing happens. The pot continues to boil, steaming porridge pouring
down its sides!
189032: AKAZOO!' I shout at the top of my lungs. At first nothing seems to be
happening, but after a few moments the flow of porridge slows down, and finally
stops. The remaining porridge trickles away through cracks in the cave floor.
189196: The magic porridge pot is far too big and heavy for me to carry! There
must be another way of moving it.
189272: A large metal stick tapered at one end. It looks very strong.
189320: The air is completely still - there's not a breath of wind.
189368: Bars on all the windows - these bears are sticklers for security!
189416: I give the window a well-aimed kick between the metal bars but even my
size 7 Doc Martens have no effect on the toughened, reinforced glass.
189516: The iron window bars resist all my feeble attempts to damage them.
189608: aerial. The roof is a little too high for me to reach.
189652: A little thatched porch over the front door. It would be quite pretty
except that someone has seen fit to paint it gold. Whoever it was has obviously
seen one too many episodes of "Changing Rooms."
189796: It looks a little out of place on such a picturesque little cottage.
It's been moved slightly for a better signal.
189876: It looks a little out of place on such a picturesque little cottage.
189924: Okay - that should improve the picture!
189956: I guess Papa Bear's a bit touchy about other people sitting in his
chair! A cable attached to the electrodes disappears into the back of the
chair.
190060: I think it must supply the power to those electrodes!
190128: No, no good - I couldn't even cut my hair with these secateurs - too
rusty.
190184: The secateurs cut through the insulation like a knife through
butter...

   ...Unfortunately I forgot to turn off the power supply first! 240
volts sear through my body filling the room with an odour not dissimilar to
roast pork. The bears come home to find my blackened skeleton grinning at them
from behind the armchair! I'm dead, and it's all your fault!
190440: Okay, I use the secateurs to cut the cable connecting the electrodes to
the power supply. Let's see Papa Bear try to fry me now!
190536: There's really not a lot I can say about them except that they're tall,
they're made of wood, and they're absolutely bloody everywhere!
190636: It's as stiff as a board. One for the glue factory I'm afraid. And to
think this noble beast died whilst trying to steal a peice of cheese.
190736: Lying in the middle of the floor with all four legs pointing heavenward
is a dead coach horse.
190800: The dead horse declines to comment on that subject.
190836: I think I'll just leave it where it is, thankyou. Besides, I couldn't
lift it even if I wanted to!
190912: Listen perve, examine your own underwear, okay?
190948: I suppose you think you're clever, do you? It's ruddy freezing in this
place!
191004: I suppose you want me to wander around the cottage naked, do you! Well
I've got better things to be doing than performing a striptease for a spotty
computer geek!
191120: I'm not carrying my underwear. I must have left it somewhere. Again.
191172: Thankyou. I was beginning to feel a little chilly.
191212: It's a wonder that fat lump Papa Bear manages to get up these stairs at
all. There are some rather severe scratches in the paintwork on either side, as
though someone had recently dragged a large, heavy object up there.
191368: It's a ramshackle structure that was obviously cobbled together in five
minutes some idle Sunday afternoon.
191444: The potting shed doesn't even have a door. It must have fallen off its
hinges and rotted away years ago.
191524: The flooring consists of bare floorboards, as befits a dwelling of this
sort.
191584: The forest floor is covered with bark and dead leaves.
191628: The ground here is solid rock. It is riddled with tiny cracks and
fissures.
191688: The ground is covered in long, unkempt grass.
191724: The sky is blue with a couple of little fluffy clouds. Aw, bless.
191854: I'd like to be able to tell you what kinds of trees there are but I got
kicked out of the Girl Scouts for - let's just say - gross misconduct - with
one of the Boy Scout leaders...
191988: The cracks seem quite deep, but very fine. There's nothing particularly
special about them.
192060: The porridge level is creeping steadily higher! I think it might be a
good idea to GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!!!
192152: Somehow I don't think I'm going to be able to eat my way out of this.
192208: A narrow passage through the wilderness maintained by generations of
travellers through the forest.
192276: He's tall, dark and greasy looking with an air of pompousness you can
cut with a knife. His skin still has a greenish tinge as though he weren't
quite recovered from being a frog. And those clothes, well, don't even get me
started. What self-respecting heterosexual guy wears crimson tights in this day
and age?
192496: Prince Charming is standing here, viewing his surroundings with an air
of distaste.
192558: right,' says the Prince, 'That's quite enough of mingling with the
commoners. God these official visits are tedious. Where am I, anyway?'
192662: yes, yes, well I must be off.' says the Prince, adjusting his tights
which seem to have a tendancy to ride up in the crotch. 'I'll send you a signed
photograph or something. Pip pip.'
192798: what am I doing, standing here talking to you?' says the Prince,
suddenly, 'Far more important things to do, I expect. Toodle-oo.'
192898: if it's a real princess you're after,' I say as casually as I can, 'you
should check out the bird up in the Three Bears' bedroom. Name of Sleeping
Beauty.'
   'Sleeping Beauty?' replies the prince, 'sounds intriguing. A woman
who spends all her time asleep won't be able to nag me or object when I'm out
late drinking with the boys. Where is this princess of which you speak? Lead me
to her!'
193270: hey, it's just a little trinket of mine. Comes with the job you know.'
193326: love to, babe, but I'm a prince remember. You're just a common peasant.
A guy's gotta have standards, you know. With me it's a real princess or
nothing.'
193442: yeah, it's a little old fashioned I admit, but you'd be surprised at
the reactions I get. What woman doesn't like to look at a pair of toned and
muscular thighs?
193634: just another name for a witch if you ask me, babe. Tie weights to her
legs and throw her in a river. If that doesn't kill her, burn her at the stake.
That usually works for me.'
193762: ya, I'm going to have it all cut down when I'm king to make way for a
business park. And a bowling alley. And a mall.'
193850: you're pretty cute for a peasant. Maybe when I'm all married and
settled down with a wife and heir, we can get together and have some fun.'
193950: hey, it wasn't so bad. The flies take some getting used to, especially
when you're accustomed to lobster and caviar. It didn't really work out for me,
but it could work for you. You should try it.'
194094: don't worry. When I find that old crone she's gonna wish she turned
194146: yeah, it's gonna be a blast. Anyone who's anyone is gonna be there. But
I can't turn up without a date!'
194270: sorry babe, gotta run. I must find a date for the Royal Ball, but first
I gotta find a way out of this forest...'
194492: I can feel that goggle-eyed git mentally undressing me. To be fair, he
hasn't got far to go. Do you think we could look for my dress after this?
194722: we must meet up for a drink sometime,' sniggers the Prince, 'But only
if you've got nothing on. Oh, but of course you haven't! Got anything on!
Hahahahahaha!' I don't mind the lechery, really I don't - but I can't stand a
man who laughs at his own jokes!
194914: okay,' says the Prince to himself, 'Naked girl. Wandering around.
Naked. Get a grip on yourself Princey Boy. Take it slow. You're probably
imagining things. All that time spent as a frog - bound to take its toll on a
chap...'
195282: okay gorgeous. Stop right there!' says the Prince. 'I know I'm
drop-dead dishy and everything but if you wanted me you only had to ask. No
need to flaunt yourself like a floozy... Oh who am I kidding? Come here, you
scrumptious little trollop!'
195462: one more step,' I say, indicating my size 7 Doctor Martens, 'and you
get one of these right in the frogspawn. Savvy?'
195654: oh, now look what you've made me do,' says the Prince as he lands
beside me, 'I've laddered my tights. I'm going to have to change them now -
can't go to the ball looking like a scarecrow.'
195792: As the prince reaches the top of the stairs he notices Sleeping Beauty
sprawled across Baby Bear's bed. 
   'Now that's what I call a REAL princess!'
he says, 'forget the royal ball. I'm marrying this honey!' A quick kiss wakes
Beauty, and the happy couple are off to the cathedral. That's no basis for a
lasting relationship!
196104: Actually, he doesn't have bad legs, at that. Maybe it's time tights for
men made a comeback...
196180: It's a gaudy affair covered in diamonds and rubies. He's got to be an
idiot wandering around here with something like that on his head.
196276: What's wrong? Haven't you ever seen a frog wearing a crown before?
196336: What big eyes he has! What big teeth he has!! And what a big...
...oh,
never mind. For some reason he is dressed as an old woman in a bonnet and
nightgown, but each to their own, I say.
196476: The Big Bad Wolf is here, doing his best to look mean and dangerous.
196622: well,' says the wolf, 'it was nice talking to you, but I really must be
off. Those piggies won't get eaten all by themselves.'
196718: as much as I've enjoyed chewing the fat with you,' says the wolf, 'I'd
rather be chewing on some crackling. Now where are those pigs?'
196816: I shall huff, and I shall puff, and I shall have that turbine turning
in a jiffy!' True to his word, the wolf huffs, and he puffs, and he blows the
turbine with a gale-force blast of air that sends it spinning like a toy
windmill.
   'My debt is paid, dear child - I shall now return to the forest
which is the natural habitat of a fearsome predator such as I. I bid you
adieu!' With that he gives a low bow, at which point the oil can falls from the
top of the turbine and bops him on the head. With a cluck of annoyance he
hitches up the hem of his nightdress, hops over the fence and disappears into
the forest.
197248: You want me to do it again? I don't think I've got the energy!
197396: There's no time for hanky-panky - it's <the time>.
197528: why they call you the Big Bad Wolf' I say as we lie side by side
staring dreamily into space.
   The wolf just grins and takes a final drag on
his cigarette before extinguishing it.
   'Baby, that was
197672: ' he replies, 'but I think it's time we got on with the story. It's
197944: And just how am I going to get a good night's sleep if the wolf has
blown the cottage down?
198008: I'd probably end up twenty miles from here.
198040: I don't think even the Big Bad Wolf is capable of that.
198160: I do think the wolf's talents would be better utilised blowing
something that actually needs blowing.
198326: here you go, Wolfie!' I say, shoving the pork chops under his quivering
nose. He recoils in amateur-dramatic horror.
   'Cretinous child!' He roars, 'I
can't possibly eat those! Do I look like an arctic fox? Am I similar in
appearance to a polar bear? Nay, I am a wolf! A wily wanderer of the woodlands!
Were I to attempt to eat those my delicate jaws would shatter like glass! Take
them away, and don't bring them back until they're medium rare!'
198652: The wolf grabs the packet of pork chops and tears off the wrapper, then
rolls on the floor gnawing at them like a dog with an old slipper. Moments
later, when he has recovered his dignity, he rises to his feet and says
   'My
dear girl, that was simply exquisite! I am indebted for you for that delectable
dish! If there is anything I can do in return, simply name it, and it will be
done! Huffing and puffing a speciality...'
199030: no thankyou my dear, I am quite sated. Once, in the prime of my youth,
I might have eaten a bear or three as a snack between meals, but now, alas, my
appetite is not what it once was.'
199266: why, thankyou my dear - a most delicious meal! Now if there is any way
in which I can repay you let us attend to it at once - I have things to do and
places to be. Wolfing is a busy business and I have no time for
shilly-shallying!'
199586: huffing and puffing are a speciality of mine - in fact there is no
bigger windbag than I in the Enchanted Forest. Show me this infernal
contraption and I will blow it like it has never been blown before!'
199962: ah, so you noticed. I must have forgotten to remove my disguise. I
don't normally dress this way but I must say this nightgown affords an
extraordinary freedom of movement. The flow of air around my, ahem, is really
quite exhilarating'
200166: ah, yes - my natural habitat. I am a fierce and fearless hunter, don't
forget - you should really be quaking in those delightful boots of yours you
know.'
200364: I had him for breakfast. And his cow. The cow was delicious but he was
rather on the stringy side.'
200496: 'I understand he's been turned into a frog. Interesting flavour, frogs.
Rather like chicken, only greener.'
200578: all these cottages in the forest look the same to me. I called at the
home of the Seven Dwarves last week by mistake. They tried to make fun of my
knees, but couldn't think of very much to say about them.'
200726: no more of this idle banter! If there is something you wish me to do
for you, let us attend to it immediately. I am a cunning hunter of the
wilderness, and have no time to waste in frivolous conversation!'
201166: The Big Bad Wolf taps his foot impatiently.
201202: The Big Bad Wolf stares distractedly into the space.
201244: The Big Bad Wolf scratches his ear.
201404: I think it's meant to be a disguise. You'd have to be pretty stupid to
mistake a huge, hairy, slavering wolf for your own grandmother. Or maybe not;
depends on the grandmother I suppose.
201544: I can't see the wolf's knees as he is wearing a long nightdress.
201604: Okay, so technically she's Cinderella's Fairy Godmother, but what she
doesn't know won't hurt her. She's a tiny little woman who must be ninety years
old if she's a day. She's wearing what I can only describe as a heavily
sequined ballerina's outfit which looks hideously wrinkled on her shrivelled
frame. Top this off with surgical support stockings and a pair of cardboard
wings stuck on with sellotape, and you get the picture.
201908: 'I don't know, you doctors are all the same. Agnes? Agnes? Is that
you?'
202050: no, no, no... We must do things properly! Before the ballgown comes,
what was it now? Oh yes! The coach and horses. Of course! I'll need four white
mice for that, and oh, what was the other thing? Oh, never mind. Just fetch me
some mice.'
202230: oh, yes dear - that was it,' says my Fairy Godmother, 'You can't
possibly go to the ball looking like that!' I'm a little offended by this but
decide to bite my lip.    'Wait a second while I reprogram my wand.' After a
few moments she raises the wand and waves it frantically as though it were
stuck to her hand and she were desperate to get rid of it. There is a sudden,
bright flash and my dress disappears in a puff of smoke!
   'Oh dear,' says my
Fairy Godmother with a frown, 'that's not the rags-to-ballgown spell, it's the
one for moving stuff down to the cellar, I used it last weekend when I cleared
out the spare room. I'm sorry my dear, I shall have to go home and get my spell
book. I'd forget my wings if they were't sellotaped on.'    There is another
flash and she turns back into a tiny point of light, before flitting back out
of the window. As she does so, something silvery clatters to the floor.
202882: yes, that's right dear. Now, what was that other thing? Oh, yes -
you're going to need something to wear. Can't have you going to the royal ball
in those rags!'
203002: yes, that's right dear, white mice. Four of them, preferably, but
otherwise as many as you can find. Agnes, is that you? Where's my medicine?'
203110: we'll just have to make do without one, dear. Now what else was it I
needed? Oh, yes - some mice!'
203186: what was that, Cinderella dear? A pumpkin, that's right. Is it time for
my bath?'
203248: 'I had one somewhere but I can't remember where I put it. Oh, here it
is.'
203306: yes, that's right dear. It's a little tempermental at times. I really
ought to get it fixed but I'm always so busy. Who are you, anyway?'
203570: No, not lemmings. Oh dear, it was some kind of rodent...'
203902: oh, yes, glass slippers. Never found them very comfortable myself, and
they're murder if you try to run in them. You'll be picking splinters out of
your feet for weeks. But first we need to sort you out some transportation...'
204066: oh, there you are Cinders dear. I'm so glad I haven't got the wrong
house again. Those dwarves made fun of my knees. Never fear, you shall go to
the, to the, oh what was it? Agnes is that you? Is it time for my bath?'
204226: no, no, there's no time for that now. There's work to be done. Did you
get me that pumpkin?'
204522: they made fun of my knees. People can be so cruel...'
204566: oh yes, I do read that from time to time. But I must say I prefer
204618: oh no, I never turn people into frogs. Well, not unless they've been
especially naughty.'
204720: It's a silvery rod with a glittery star sellotaped to the top of it.
204768: I give the wand a good waggle but nothing happens. I think the idea
must be to wave it at something specific.
204912: I don't see much point in using the wand here!
204948: I don't think there's much point in trying that again. He might turn
nasty.
205004: I think I'm going to have to find another way to shift her.
205048: , but instead of the usual vanishing act there is a loud BANG. Before I
know what is happening, I feel a wave of nausea and pass out. When I come round
I'm horrified to discover that I'm now
205188: too! The wand is lying several feet away, now nothing but a blackened
stick. I think I might have used it one too many times. Well I guess that's the
end - I hardly think
205312: I wave the wand at the Prince half hoping that it will turn the smug
git back into a frog. Sure enough there is a bright flash and the Prince
disappears in a puff of smoke - but seconds later there's another flash and
he's back; plumes of acrid green smoke rising from his robes. And he's
fuming.
'I say - watch where you point that thing!' he yells, 'I've had enough
of magic to last me a lifetime, thankyou!'
Perhaps the spell doesn't work on
living creatures.
205644: I wave the wand at Sleeping Beauty in the hope that it will move her
down to the cellar and out of my way. Sure enough there is a bright flash and a
puff of smoke - but Beauty remains exactly where she was, sleeping like a baby,
plumes of acrid green smoke rising from her clothes. Perhaps the spell doesn't
work on living creatures.
205876: I'm not wearing any underwear thanks to you!
205908: There is a bright flash and my underwear disappears in a puff of
smoke!

Damn it! I'm completely starkers now! You've got your three points - I
hope you're satisfied!
206064: reappears, clouds of acrid green smoke billowing from its surface. I
don't think the wand is powerful enough to move fixed objects.
206156: The wand is starting to get rarther warm.
206232: The wand is red hot and spitting sparks! I don't think I ought to use
it anymore.
206328: Ding-Dong!' The doorbell rings. A booming voice can be heard from the
direction of the front door: 'Little pigs, little pigs, LET ME IN, or I'll huff
and I'll puff and I'll BLOW YOUR HOUSE IN!'
206618: Somebody is banging on the front door!
206656: Right!' booms the Big Bad Wolf, 'You asked for it!' From the porch
there is a sound like a huge bellows being pumped as the Big Bad Wolf unleashes
an almighty blast of air from his lungs. It's as though the cottage is caught
up in a tornado! The windows implode, the walls collapse and the whole wattle
and daub structure comes crashing down around me! I try to run for cover but
unfortunately a heavy wooden beam bashes me on the bonce.
206964: Uh-oh - the big hand and the little hand on my wristwatch are both
pointing to the number twelve. You know what that means? It means it's noon and
I'm screwed. Those bears will be tucking into what's left of their porridge any
minute now, and bang go my chances of a good night's sleep. Thanks for your
help, but next time I go to a party I'm definitely getting the night bus!
207232: I collapse from exhaustion.  I wake up the next morning, but I didn't
get my proper beauty sleep. My reputation suffers. The three bears didn't kill
me, but they might as well have. My life has been ruined.
207384: The door swings open, and the three bears come walking through.
207432: The three bears walk in through the front door.
207468: They seem a little surprised when they fall through the rug, but that
doesn't stop them for long. I try to run, but
207552: In the distance, I hear a sound much like that of three bears falling
through an open trapdoor. If it was, it didn't stop them for long because while
that's still registering,
207676: A large shadow looms over me...

   Before I can turn around,
207724: someone lays a large heavy paw on my shoulder. I turn my head to see
three shaggy forms bearing down on me, if you'll excuse the pun, their hot,
fetid breath in my face.
208126: upset! What shall we do with her, Pater?'
   'I think she'd look lovely
on our trophy wall,' says Papa Bear. 'especially with all that lovely hair.'
  
He produces a red hot poker from behind his back. 'But first I think we'll take
her down to the dungeon and have ourselves a little fun...'

   Uh-oh. There's
no getting out of this one! Somehow, I think the adventure is over...
208412: Immediately the magic porridge pot begins to fill up with extremely hot
porridge. It just sort of swirls up from the bottom of the pot like an
expensive special effect. Within seconds the pot is full and the porridge
begins to run down the sides...
208584: The room is rapidly filling up with boiling-hot porridge! I think it
might be a good idea to get the hell out of here!
208668: The porridge level creeps steadily higher until finally it is up to my
neck! Like quicksand it gradually sucks me under...
208756: Extremely hot porridge is gushing down the sides of the porridge pot.
The room is steadily beginning to fill up with the stuff.
208844: Uh-oh - what's that? I could have sworn I saw a pair of big, yellow
eyes staring at me through the leaves...
208926: Can't help feeling I'm being watched...
208962: From somewhere comes the blood-curdling howl of a wolf...
209008: Damn! The gloves just dropped off my hands! Yes, both of them, at the
same time! What are the chances of that?
209092: While I'm struggling to come up with a way out of this mess, there's a
strange hiss and a cloud of purple gas starts to pour from a concealed nozzle
somewhere in the chair mechanism...
209224: The room begins to spin, and consciousness fades. Mercifully, I barely
notice boiling alive.
209354: Suddenly I'm feeling really sleepy - even sleepier than I was before.
The room begins to spin and I feel violently sick. The next thing I know is I'm
lying in some sort of dungeon, manacled to the wall and the Three Bears are
bearing down on me, their hot, fetid breath on my face...

'Who's been sitting
in my chair?' says Papa Bear in a mocking, sing-song voice. From behind his
back he produces a red hot poker. 'Well, little girl, when we're through with
you you won't be sitting on anything - for a very long time!'

The bears'
mocking laughter echoes in the gloom...
209778: Whilst I'm wandering aimlessly around, twitching my big lop-ears and
twinkling my nose, unbeknown to me the pedlar has been sneaking up behind with
a big net. I struggle to free myself but to no avail...
   'I can't believe you
really ate that bean!' cackles the pedlar as he leads me, bound and gagged,
through the forest. 'I'm very glad you did though, because you, my lop-eared
friend, are going to make me a whole hatful of money!'
   I spend the rest of
my days as the star of a carnival freakshow-cum-cabaret act;
210406: Suddenly I notice something out of the corner of my eye...

   It's the
tiny point of light I saw hovering outside the window! It whizzes two or three
times around my head and then, with a sharp 'ping' transforms into a tiny
little old lady with wings. She doesn't look pleased.
   'CINDERELLA!' She
snaps, still slightly dizzy from her flight, 'If I had know what a violent,
ill-mannered girl you were I wouldn't have flown all this way to help you go to
the royal ball!' I try to protest but she wags a wizened finger under my nose
and continues, inching ever forward until I'm cornered.
   'Smashing that
window like that, you frightened my out of my wits! No, my girl, you won't be
going to the ball, not until you've learned to act like a lady. In the meantime
you can see what it feels like to be a frog!'
   With a wave of her wand she
transforms me into a small green amphibian. She never does come back to reverse
the spell and I spend the rest of my days sitting on a lily pad in the Three
Bears' pond.
211140: How do I prevent the wolf from blowing the house down?
211248: Why doesn't the button on the large chair do anything?
211288: You need to generate some power first.
211316: With a little help from an old friend...
211348: How do I stop the front door from blowing shut?
211384: You need to find something to wedge it open with.
211420: How do I get into the Three Bears' Cottage?
211456: You need to follow Jack's example.
211484: Follow the instructions on the packet of magic beans. Climb the
beanstalk and from there you should be able to find another way into the
cottage.
211584: Why is there nothing on television?
211612: What should I put in the toaster?
211636: How do I get into Papa Bear's workshop?
211668: You need to create a nuclear explosion.
211696: Can I eat the porridge in the large and medium-sized bowls?
211740: You should have put two and two together by now!
211776: The right tool for the right job.
211856: How do I get Daisy to the Pedlar?
211884: Perhaps you could bribe her with something nice to eat?
211924: Give Daisy the turnip. She'll follow you around like a little puppy
then!
211980: How do I prevent myself from being electrocuted?
212016: Cut off the power supply to the electrodes!
212048: You need to get your strength up!
212072: A nice big bowl of porridge will do the trick.
212104: What should I do with Cinderella's Fairy Godmother?
212144: How do I move the magic porridge pot?
212172: How do I make sure the bears don't find me when they get home?
212216: Make sure they don't get much further than their own front door!
212264: How do I get rid of Sleeping Beauty?
212292: Only a kiss from a handsome prince can wake her!
212328: Is there any way to extend the time limit?
212360: There is, but it is cheating; you won't get the best ending if you do
this.
212416: BREAK THE WRISTWATCH to stop time.
212452: There is one match left in the matchbox.
212484: The matchbox contains just two matches.

212840: Man, what a party! That was a night to remember - actually it'll be a
miracle if I remember it at all tomorrow!  Oh, by the way, I'm Goldilocks. I'm
a nineteen year old blonde bombshell and I'm on my way back from yet another
crazy art school party. It's about five AM and the sun's already up, as are the
birds, who are doing their level best to aggravate my hangover with their
bloody singing! I could really use something to eat and somewhere to sleep off
this hangover, but something tells me I shouldn't have taken this shortcut
through the forest. I have a really baaad feeling about it...
213266: I awake at around six, having had a full night's, or rather day's
sleep, fresh as a daisy and ready for another night of partying!

  That's if I
can ever find my way out of the enchanted forest...

  ...but that's another
story! The important thing is, our plan worked! The Three Bears are no more and
foxy young chicks are free to roam the forest and break into quaint little
cottages without fear of ending up as a Bondage Barbie for a family of furry
freaks! Thanks for all your help, I sure as hell couldn't have done it without
you!
213656: This isn't a good place to plant things.
213688: It wouldn't do me any good to plant that.
213748: There's no point to knocking on that.
213804: I don't have anything suitable for oiling.
