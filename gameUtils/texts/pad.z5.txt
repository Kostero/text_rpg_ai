45452: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
45484: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
45544: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
45588: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
45628: I didn't understand that sentence.

descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
46548: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).
46632: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
46808: This dangerous act would achieve little.
46836: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
46868: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.

46980: There's nothing suitable to drink here.

47036: Real adventurers do not use such language.
47068: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
47096: There's not enough water to swim in.
47124: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
47152: That would be less than courteous.
47176: Is that the best you can think of?
47200: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
47240: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
47272: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
47360: You're In The Paddling Room. Against the wall is the infamous BendMaster
5000 Restraint. To the north is a door marked "OFFICE".
47464: The Bendmaster 5000 restraint system is the most effective way to
prevent the resistant miscreant from evading or delaying the full measure of
paddling. It keeps them bent down, and keeps their hands from interfering with
or being injured by the paddle.
47640: You see a worried looking, bent-over kid nonchalantly struggling to free
himself from the BendMaster 5000, which shows no sign of allowing it.
47744: The kid is wailing and carrying on with a blotchy red-faced passion,
still securely bent over in the BendMaster 5000.
47832: This is the reception office, and you are here along with a
receptionist; You notice a sign with "Rules" written in red letters above the
receptionist's cash register. To the south you can see a door marked "PADDLING
ROOM".
48004: The Kid Is Smirking And Rolling His Eyes.
48040: The Kid Has Now Stopped Smirking And Rolling His Eyes. He looks a bit
apprehensive about being in the BendMaster 5000.
48132: The kid appears to be suffering from both BLOTCHY RED FACE SYNDROME and
BURNT BEHIND SYNDROME at this point and has taken up a vitriolic form of
wailing to prove his point. No trace of smirking is on his face now.
48304: The kid is shrieking his fool head off and trying frantically to grip
his behind.
48442: HHHHAAAAAAAAAAHHHAAAAAA". He no longer appears to be interested in
making farting noises. Occasionally, he pauses in his shrieking to say
"Huh-huh-huh-huuuuh!", but relapses into screaming shortly thereafter.
48608: Waaaaaahaaaahaaaaaaa.. It buuurrrrrnsss.. Woooahhhaaaaa
48652: The kid repeatedly throws his middle finger up at you vigorously and
laughs.
48704: Woooooooaaaaaaaaaa.... It burrrrrrrns... Huh-HuhWaaaaaaaa
48752: The kid makes farting noises with his mouth as you speak. He laughs
loudly and flicks you off repeatedly and vigorously.
48836: The receptionist is filing papers and answering the phone. She appears
to be an old bag for the sake of easy reference.
48920: "I see you've paddled that unruly little ape! That will teach him a
thing or two!" She addresses the kid, "Brine! Brine! Are you going to behave
now or does Dr. Beltway need to put you back in the BendMaster 5000 and paddle
you again?" Brine seems to have no sense of space or time, and only continues
his loud squalling, grabbing mechanically at his rear with both hands, his face
locked in a reddened, open-mouthed rictus of abject despondence.
49240: She says, "That kid elbowed a little girl in the nose and then kicked
his teacher. He needs a paddling! His parents said that they always use
time-out but that he doesn't seem to pay any attention to it."
49384: She says, "What are you, on drugs? You already took the kid!"
49432: She says "I believe in paddling! I love this job! Paddling's where it's
at!"
49604: This is the parking lot for The Paddling Werkshoppe. To the south is the
entrance. To the east the Baylor School of Punishment can be seen.
49708: You are standing at the entrance to the world-renowned Baylor School of
Punishment. The magnificence of the building entrances you, and the stone
gargoyles at the corners of the rooftop seem to be sending a warning to unruly
children everywhere. To the west you see the Paddling Werkshoppe and to the
east the arched stone entryway towers above you.
49952: This is the foyer for the Baylor School of Punishment. Vaulted ceilings
echo Claude King's "Wolverton Mountain" which is coming from hidden speakers.
To the west you see the entrance, and hallways to the south and north marked
"Paddling Hall" and "Time Out Hall", respectively.
50156: You are in a brightly-lit grand hallway with one door marked
"Information" to the east.
50220: You enter the room and a wizened old man seated behind a oak desk says
"You seek the wisdom of the paddle? Come and ask me what you wish!".
50320: The old man has a long white beard and lots of knowledge in his head.
50368: "Children need paddlings like fish need water! Without paddlings,
children grow up to be rotten, ignorant, lawbreaking morons!"
50460: "You need a paddle! Without a paddle, an adult is just a cartoon
character to a child. With a paddle, the adult becomes a powerful force of
justice and order in the hedonistic and ignorant world of the child."
50608: "That Beltway fellow is an upstanding man of great fortitude and honor!
I am proud to have his Paddling Werkshoppe in the same adventure with me!"
50712: "This school tries to show the right way to discipline children. We
encourage paddling where the Time-Out method fails, which is nearly everywhere.
50816: Time-Out is practice for prison advocated by stupid people who eat a lot
of milquetoast. Don't waste your time.
50896: "I have nothing worthwhile to say about that!"
50936: The paddle has "Heat For The Seat" written on one side and "Baylor
School" on the other side. It has holes drilled in it.
51028: This is a dimly lit hall smelling of dust and milquetoast. There is a
door to the east marked "Time-Owt Infermashun".
51116: This room is both dusty and musty, smelling of milquetoast. You see a
young man in a dunce cap seated behind a filthy desk.
51204: The milquetoast looks like hog-slop in a "Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"
bowl.
51264: The young man is wearing expensive clothes and a large red dunce cap
marked "DUNCE" in bold black letters. He is holding a dripping spoon in his
dirty hand, and appears to be hungrily eyeballing the bowl of milquetoast you
have in your hand.
51436: The young man is wearing expensive clothes and a large red dunce cap
marked "DUNCE" in bold black letters. He is holding a dripping spoon in his
dirty hand, beating it on the desk, and chanting, "We want milquetoast!"
loudly.
51600: The young man is wearing expensive clothes and a large red dunce cap
marked "DUNCE" in bold black letters. He appears to be very fond of
milquetoast, slurping it in a revolting fashion as portions of it drip down his
face.
51756: Hey! Drop that milquetoast! It's mine, dammit!
51792: Where's my milquetoast, you son of a whore!!
51828: "Duh, I like Time-Out 'cause it gives kids a chance to rest between
misbehaving sessions and 'cause it gets kids ready for prison. I think kids
should eat more milquetoast, too. Sluuuurrrrpppp.."
51972: "Slurrrrp.... Duh, I like milquetoast.. Sluuuurrrrpppp"
52020: You wind up mightily, prepared to deliver the first blazing whack, when
you notice that you have no paddle.... Goofball...
52112: The receptionist says, "Don't screw with me, buster. I'm in no mood for
foolishness!". Paddlings are best applied to children.
52208: Before you even finish the thought, the Old Man waves his hands in an
arcane manner, causing you to wail your own face with the paddle with a
resounding "SMACK!". "I thought you had more sense than that", the Old Man says
with a sly grin.
52382: The young man sees you coming at him, waves his milquetoast-soaked hands
in your direction, and you swing the paddle forcefully into your own face!
"POP!" 
He says, "At least the old guy down the hall only paddles children who
don't care that they did something wrong! Your'e a big idiot, trying to paddle
me just for liking milquetoast!"
52628: wildly and severely, shouting "You Will Respect My Authoritah!!" until
you realize that you are acting like a complete ass, and become sheepish.
"Silly Adventurer, Paddlings Are For Children."
52772: You may only paddle the kid one time. Punishment is good, abuse is bad.
52864: The Kid Writhes, Wiggles, and Dodges your attempts to apply the heat to
his seat.
52990: AAHHHAAAAAAAAAHHAAAAAAAA.
