19664: But it's dark.
19681: You find nothing of interest.
19717: But it's dark.
19808: You find nothing of interest.
20936: . Not bad.
20954: That was a rhetorical question.
20990: You can't decide who to pray to.
21028: That seems unnecessary.
21069: You smell nothing unexpected.
21096: You hear nothing unexpected.
21121: You taste nothing unexpected.
21156: Keep your hands to yourself!
21181: You feel nothing unexpected.
21206: If you think that'll help.
21315: Oh, don't apologise.
21412: You achieve nothing by this.
21634: You are unable to.
21653: Nothing obvious happens.
21703: That's not a direction.
21726: Not that way you can't.
21758: Keep your hands to yourself.
21783: You achieve nothing by this.

45100: Don't try to cross him.
45301: He seems to be ignoring you.

45489: That could be considered rude.
45582: He is not interested.
45658: Bit early for that.
45688: Bit early for that.
45722: Bit early for that.
46093: He doesn't want a prezzy.
46138: The door seems to be stuck.
46229: That's not going to work, is it.
46344: Don't try to cross him.
46422: Eh?
46513: The water shimmers ominously.
46667: He doesn't want that.
46706: Try typing IN.
46755: Don't mess with the dog.

50436: [You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
50472: [Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
50512: "Oops" can only correct a single word.
50540: You see nothing. Not because there is nothing to see, but because there
is no light.
50600: Quick, fetch my gun! Oh. Just you.
50628: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
50688: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
50732: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
50772: I didn't understand that sentence.
50832: You seem to have said too little!
50856: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
50892: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
50928: You excepted something not included anyway!
50960: You can only do that to something animate.
50992: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

51072: Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which exactly?
51224: Shall we try that again? Answer yes or no.

51308: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupt.

51516: You can only get into something freestanding.

51580: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
51620: is now in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gives long
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
51716: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).
51800: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
51976: There's a time and a place for everything.
52008: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
52040: This relationship is not meant to be.
52068: What? That's your job! I'm not expected to think! What made you think I
could think for myself?
52140: Digging would achieve nothing here.
52168: You imitate your hero, Skippy. No-one is impressed.
52208: You would achieve nothing by this.
52232: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
52260: But there's no water here to carry.
52288: Find some outlet for those negative feelings.
52320: You aren't impressing anyone, you know.
52352: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
52380: There's not enough water to swim in.
52408: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
52436: You wave to your invisible friends.
52464: That would be less than courteous.
52488: Is that the best you can think of?
52512: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
52582: Pinafore'.
52592: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
52624: You lay your head down, but can't seem to drop off in this situation.
52736: You laugh out loud in sheer joy of being alive. You feel a bit better.
52788: You mock the world around you and feel a bit better.
52828: You double check your identity. Agent Arthur Yahtzee, AY17.
52888: wristwatch uses advanced technology to scan the surrounding astral
bodies and determine the time wherever you are. It also has a hinged face which
acts as a secret compartment. Ah, the wonderful world of espionage.
53040: Slip it under the tongue, or dissolve it in solution and drink it, and
within seconds you will have appeared to have died from a perfectly ordinary
heart attack. Isn't technology marvellous?
53172: Losing the will to live, you slip the pill down your gullet. It'll take
a few seconds for it to work, so I'd just like to take this opportunity to tell
you that you are one of the worst adventurers I've ever had to write about. But
that doesn't mean I haven't developed special... feelings for you in the time
we've had together. I know it isn't right, but somehow - oh God, can't you see
what I'm trying to tell you? I love you, man!
53540: crumbled and the world was destroyed, but it wouldn't be true. They sent
the work experience boy the next day and he vanquished Dr. Diablo once and for
all after an epic adventure. I could have written about that kid, but no. I
opted to write about you. So now you've made us both look foolish.
53752: Surreptitiously slip this little green pill into someone's food or
drink, and they'll be rendered unconscious for exactly twenty-four hours.
Needless to say this invention took many years of development to perfect, and
the testing centre rocked with the heady laughs of scientists high on
mysterious chemicals.
53968: You swallow the pill, and immediately collapse. Your fellow agents,
detecting this through the implant behind your ear, teleport you back to base
and put you on the waiting list for immediate suicide counselling. They sent
the work experience boy the next day and he vanquished Dr. Diablo once and for
all after an epic adventure. I could have written about that kid, but no. I
opted to write about you. So now you've made us both look foolish.
54284: The top of this seemingly ordinary biro works as a microphone, the nib
as a speaker. It enables field agents to communicate with the base. It will not
work if you're outside a specific radius, though.
54448: Q.
54456: Patent pending.
54468: After numerous adventures you have penetrated the very centre of the
Temple, to this tiny little vault where the cursed dessert lies. The room is
small and unordained, unlike the rest of the temple, with just crumbly yellow
bricks forming the walls and concrete making up the floor and ceiling. The exit
door is to the south and the centre of the room is dominated by a cylindrical
podium.
54860: gent can. Eventually you emerge from the temple (or No. 15 Ealing Road,
Brentford as some people prefer to call it), lock the door behind you and turn
around. Into fifteen armed soldiers' lines of fire. 

 "Hand over the
cheesecake and you will walk away alive," booms the megaphone-enhanced voice of
Dr. Diablo. Isn't it funny how the evil bastards always manage to attract so
many henchmen to their cause?
55156: You mustn't leave without the cheesecake!
55192: The Cheesecake of Hell was left behind after the famous Diablo Disaster
of 1997, when the legions of Hell invaded Woking (no-one noticed until 2003).
Eggs from Satan's own hens, milk from the Unholy Herd and biscuit crumbs from
Cerberus' Vomit went into the dish. Mrs. Satan originally baked it to celebrate
her and Satan's five thousandth wedding anniversary, but had never gotten round
to eating it after the Hellhounds escaped. It is now in the capable hands of
the Special Secret Service, and, when eaten, transports the consumer to some
other universe.
55594: You vow to punish yourself harshly later on for what you are about to
do, hold your nose and bring the cheesecake up to your face. A look of horror
crosses both your and Dr. Diablo's face as you take the tiniest nibble of the
damned creamy filling and swallow. 

 Immediately fireworks go off in your
mouth and stomach, and you judder violently as the Pudding of Satan sends your
mind and body into spasm. Diablo orders his men to fire, but you are already
fading away and the bullets pass harmlessly through your indistinct form. 


The world melts away from in front of your eyes and psychedelic patterns
flutter past you in swarms and droves. A spiral of energy appears before your
eyes, and before you know it you are engulfed in sparkling dust...
56120: You bring the cheesecake up to your face and attempt to take a nibble,
but the smell of the Damned puts you off. You wouldn't want to eat it anyway,
you'd only end up somewhere less fun than this.
56260: The houses in this perfectly ordinary suburban street are indistinct
behind the row of beweaponed cleanup squad. One of Dr. Diablo's many
helicopters circle overhead, pointing a spotlight in your direction.
56404: You make a break for it in that direction. Suffice to say, you are
drilled full of bullets before your trainers have even had chance to skid on
the pavement.
56512: "Don't be a fool, Mr. Yahtzee," says Dr. Diablo smugly. "You and your
pathetic Special Secret Service stand no chance against me."
56614: The smile fades from Dr. Diablo's lips. "Hand over the cheesecake or we
will retrieve it from your corpse!"
56696: Dr. Diablo waves a hand. The cleanup crew cock their weapons. Think
fast, Arthur Yahtzee!
56764: Hot lead cuts through your flesh like piranhas through water. You
collapse to the floor, lifeblood dribbling from a million different orifices -
mostly freshly made - and the last thing you hear before death overcomes you is
Dr. Diablo's victory speech. Needless to say it wasn't very inspiring, at least
not to you at that point.
56996: Dr. Diablo is the most sadistic man in the world. He is dressed in a
dirty brown overcoat and a long Dr. Who-esque scarf. He also seems to be
grinning and holding a megaphone.
57124: There is just no reasoning with the man.
57152: You drop the cheesecake on the floor and, hands above head, kick it over
to the villain. He picks it up and smiles sweetly in your direction, then waves
a hand and returns to his waiting chopper. Within seconds you resemble a cheese
grater. As a horribly deep red stain spreads across the floor, you chide
yourself for trying to strike a deal with a sadist.
57400: This man will not respond to prezzies.
57428: You perch awkwardly on a lump of soft fluffy water vapour which seems,
to you, to be both reassuringly solid and unsettlingly indistinct under your
feet. As your trainers soak up moisture you lean over and look over the edge of
the cottony mass; it really is a long way down. More clouds dot the landscape
around you, and the one just to the north could conceivably be jumped onto.
57692: One step in that direction and you'll be moving downwards rapidly for a
few seconds and the not moving at all for the rest of eternity.
57784: Small clouds of white water vapour rise up around your feet as you step
gingerly from one cloud to another. Now the mist appears to have thinned a
little in the distance and something has become visible. You don't know what it
is, but a large number of people seem to be eager to get in. Clouds to the east
and south are close enough to be stepped onto.
58028: One step in that direction and you'll be moving downwards rapidly for a
few seconds and the not moving at all for the rest of eternity.
58120: Guess what? You're on a cloud. But now you can see the thing to the
north clearly, as it is just one more jump away. It looks like some sort of
building, and a lot of people are hanging around outside.
58264: One step in that direction and you'll be moving downwards rapidly for a
few seconds and the not moving at all for the rest of eternity.
58356: The entrance to the huge, towering white marble building is to the east,
but not far from you is a lengthy queue of identically dressed people snaking
off to something indistinct.
58480: An invisible force gets in the way. "Wait your turn!" calls someone.
58532: One step in that direction and you'll be moving downwards rapidly for a
few seconds and the not moving at all for the rest of eternity.
58624: The queue consists of thousands of men and women in white suits standing
patiently. Some give the impression of having been there for a long time.
58724: You point out a cloud in the shape of the Holy Prosthesis and push into
the queue when everyone's distracted.
58802: The queue shuffles forward about six inches.
58836: You stand awkwardly in a queue, the end of which not in sight. Still
dressed in your jeans, stained with the mud of Brentford, you look decidedly
out of place.
58948: You don't want to lose your place.
58976: The man is dressed in spotless white cricket flannels, a blemishless
white shirt and a white blazer straight out of a washing powder advert. You
wonder if you should have packed your sunglasses. He has his back to you.
59128: The suit won't light. You wonder why. You seem to be attracting funny
looks. You wonder why.
59196: Burning something requires something else that is burning. Thus begins
our course on pre-school elementary physics.
59276: The man in front blows his nose deliberately loudly. Wanker.
59320: The man drops his sodden hanky on the floor. Asshole.
59360: He's not the slightest bit interested in you.
59392: It's a man-sized crumpled hanky, held together with nasal mucus.
59440: You start to pick up the hanky, but then detect the looks of disgust you
are receiving, and you put it down again.
59520: You kick the hanky to just between the legs of the man in front and,
after pointing out an interesting cloud in the shape of the Ark of the
Covenant, put a torch to the bogey ball. Immediately the flames rise upwards,
making the poor man sniff the air. He looks behind him, sees his blazer live up
to its name, and begins running around like a headless chicken on amphetamines.
The rest of the queue starts to panic in addition and soon you have instigated
quite the little riot. Seizing your opportunity, you march coolly through the
panicky mass right up to the front of what remains of the queue. You little
devil, you.
59952: Burning something requires something else that is burning. Thus begins
our course on pre-school elementary physics.
60032: You are standing in front of what appears to be a ticket window. It
seems to be shaped like a church window and has the token little drawer
underneath the glass. This is apparently a defense against robbers, although
why someone would want to steal train tickets is beyond me.
60224: You've made it to the front of the queue, don't throw it all away!
60272: The ticket clerk glares at you from behind the ticket window.
60378: from his back and a glowing halo above his head. He also bears a flat
cap and a handlebar moustache.
60448: "Name?" enquires the ticket clerk gruffly.
60484: It's a ticket office, not an information centre.
60520: "I'm afraid you will have to supply proof of identity."
60560: "Oh really? How interesting," says the clerk, stifling a yawn.
60608: You dangle your dogtags in front of his eyes, and the clerk consults a
hitherto unseen computer with Microsoft Access installed. Eventually he finds
what he is looking for. "Here we go, Yahtzee, Arthur S. According to this
you're not supposed to be here for a long time yet! You're still alive! How on
Earth did you get up here?"
60844: You flaunt the fact that you have dogtags and he doesn't. He does not
seem impressed.
60904: You open your jacket slightly and reveal the cheesecake of the Devil
sticking out of your inside pocket. The clerk stiffens in surprise and pushes a
button which opens a door next to the window. He comes out and inspects the
cheesecake again. 

 "Good lord!" he exclaims. "It's Satan's cheesecake! You
must be with the Special Secret Service. Follow me!" 

 He scampers off to
another unseen door. You follow him in uncertainly. Who - or what - could be
waiting for you beyond the door? 


"Well, Mr. Yahtzee," says God after your
story is finished. "It seems the world is in a bit of an old pickle, doesn't
it? In my expert opinion the only way to make sure Dr. Diablo doesn't get his
hands on the cheesecake is to return it to its rightful owner." 

 He doesn't
need to expand. Rummaging briefly in a desk drawer, He hands you a rectangle of
gold, laminated card. "Take this season ticket to Platform 9 and the conductor
will take you to the Underworld. But I would advise you to go prepared." 


With that, He claps his heavenly hands and a couple of cherubs escort you out
of His office.
61696: I think that would just cause undue panic.
61876: You are occupying a very bare room which is apparently a waiting room in
a train station. You are pretty certain of this owing to the station platform
visible to the north, but this white room contains nothing you have come to
associate with waiting rooms; benches, posters, coke machines and so on. This
is not something to lose sleep over, however. Another archway leads south.
62140: You are in the north-west corner of the town square. Milky white paving
stones underfoot make your footsteps echo, and the sky is a brilliant blue. Not
the blue you are familiar with - more of a deep ocean blue. All the buildings
are built from white marble, the biggest of which is a train station to the
north. Otherwise the square continues east, south and southeast.
62400: You are in the north-east corner of the town square. Milky white paving
stones underfoot make your footsteps echo, and the sky is a brilliant blue. Not
the blue you are familiar with - more of a deep ocean blue. There appears to be
some sort of huge cast iron gate to the north. Otherwise the square continues
west, south and southwest.
62636: You are in the south-west corner of the town square. Milky white paving
stones underfoot make your footsteps echo, and the sky is a brilliant blue. Not
the blue you are familiar with - more of a deep ocean blue. The entrance to
some sort of hotel lies to the south. Otherwise the square continues east,
north and northeast.
62864: You are in the south-east corner of the town square. Milky white paving
stones underfoot make your footsteps echo, and the sky is a brilliant blue. Not
the blue you are familiar with - more of a deep ocean blue. The entrance to
some sort of bar and nightclub lies to the east. Otherwise the square continues
west, north and northwest.
63096: Most of the room is in twilight and you can hardly make out the shadowy
figures around you. The only part of the room illuminated is a huge glittering
stage to the north, lit up by spotlight, on which is a huge cardboard brick
wall with a logo of some cherub apparently enjoying himself very much. The exit
door is to the west and an open door is apparent to the east.
63348: "A free drink for the man in the filthy jeans!" calls Jesus, relieved
that he has induced some response. You feel something materialize in your
jacket pocket.
63464: Ah. I'm one step ahead of you there.
63492: In a fit of rage the purple-faced Jesus casts the Divine Furies in your
direction. You try to swat them away with your hands, but that's like trying to
hold back the ocean with a tea strainer. In seconds you are reduced to a pile
of smoking ashes, and Jesus' audience suddenly find him a lot funnier. If it
makes you feel any better, Jesus later felt guilty about killing you and
decided to change his attitude to hecklers. He bought a book entitled '101 ways
to humiliate hecklers' and was soon on the Purgatory circuit. So, don't be too
disheartened.
63884: You can just make out a vacant seat nearby.
63914: You take your seat and wait patiently for a few minutes, twiddling your
earthly thumbs, and are just about to leave when the spotlights move around
hypnotically and a voice booms out "Today only, live at the Chuckling Cherub,
please put your hands together for ... Jeeeeeesssuuuuuuuussssss
Chriiiiiiiiiiiiiist!" 

 A single member of the audience claps half-heartedly
as the Messiah jigs onto the stage. You watch open-mouthed as the Son of God
breaks into a stand-up routine which utterly fails to rouse the audience.
64284: You sit back down. Perhaps you should give him another chance.
64328: You are no comedian. Your superiors would argue, but nevertheless.
64376: Jesus Christ is on the stage, attempting stand-up.
64416: It's definitely him. The long brown hair, goatee beard and glittering
halo give him away. But you've never seen him in a spangly pink suit or holding
a microphone.
64532: Leave him alone, he's trying to make a living.
64568: Hey, I just flew in from the Garden of Eden, and boy are my wings tired!
64624: Say, anyone here from the Ninth Underworld?
64656: I saw a mortal the other day. He said he hadn't had a bite in weeks. So
I bit him!
64716: My dad used to tell me, 'Son, always remember your friends. You may have
to manifest yourself to them later.'
64796: I don't think I'll ever understand this modern mortal humour.
64840: What do you call one abortion doctor on the moon? A problem.
64884: What do you call two abortion doctors on the moon? A bigger problem.
64932: What do you call all the abortion doctors on the moon? Problem solved!
64984: How many imps does it take to change a lightbulb? None, they're too busy
torturing the damned!
65052: What's the matter with you all today? Are you just laughing inwardly?
65104: And now for my duck impression. Oh, wait, that's another game.
65152: Well, if you're not going to laugh at my jokes, I'm just going to repeat
them until you do!
65252: It bears a picture of a cocktail glass and the words 'This coupon
entitles the bearer to a free bottle of Divine Ambrosia at the Chuckling Cherub
bar'. Perhaps something good came out of Jesus' routine after all.
65404: The bar is hardly the exciting bars you see on such films as Casablanca.
You are the only customer, and the bar is more of a kitchen worktop than
anything else. The walls are the usual milky white marble and the carpet on the
floor is thick enough to lose your shoes in, but nevertheless the establishment
has an air of being set up as an afterthought.
65648: There doesn't appear to be any evidence of drinks behind the bar.
65696: The barman is behind the bar, looking bored.
65852: The barman expresses disinterest through body language.
65892: Don't try to cross him. We all know what barmen keep behind the bar.
65944: The barman examines the coupon and raises a thick eyebrow. "That Jesus
is too generous. If I have to give a free drink to every man who laughs at his
jokes -" he pauses while thinking about it "- then I'd lose about tuppence a
month. Here ya go." He presses a small pink bottle into your hand, and nods in
a gesture of fellowship.
66180: The bottle is unlabelled and has a foil cap. Obviously this stuff is
like milk in the living world. The bottle contains an opaque, pink fluid.
66280: You pour the liquid down your throat, and almost immediately clutch your
stomach as it is eaten away from the inside. As your internal organs dissolve
and red slime oozes from every orifice in your body, you realise that the
divine ambrosia was never meant to be drunk by living human beings.
66480: The reception area for the hotel is consistent with all the other
buildings you have seen up here. The carpet is thick, the walls are white with
little sparkly bits deep inside. The desk is curved and elaborate with
imitation marble tops and all the swanky bollocks that swanky hotels seem to
think they need. The place is deserted, so you might as well leave by either
the exit door to the north or the wooden door to the east.
66772: You stand at the bottom of a carpeted spiral staircase which snakes
upwards to some indistinct storey.
66844: You stand at the top of a carpeted spiral staircase which snakes
downwards to the ground floor. A door is to the west.
66928: You stand at the northern end of a short hallway on the top floor of the
hotel. The decor is not dissimilar to those massive hotels in Las Vegas; the
sort people marvel at without thinking about where they got the money to build
it. The hallway continues south and the stairwell is to the east.
67132: The door in the west wall is closed.
67160: It's one of those tags you hang on doorhandles. This one reads 'Please
clean the room'.
67224: Let's just leave it there, right?
67252: You stand at the southern end of a short hallway on the top floor of the
hotel. The decor is not dissimilar to those massive hotels in Las Vegas; the
sort people marvel at without thinking about where they got the money to build
it. The hallway continues north, and there is a door to the east.
67456: The only door is closed.
67476: The only door is open.
67492: You place the tag on the door, and hear it unlock, presumably so that
the maid can get in. Everything is automatic up here, and they don't apparently
get many burglars.
67612: This must be one of those cheapo hotel rooms that you use when there's
nowhere else to go. There are no windows and the only piece of furniture is the
bed, which does not look at all inviting.
67744: It's practically just a wooden table with a mattress on top.
67788: It feels oddly heavy.
67808: Beyond the gate you can see some sort of park.
67840: The iron gate is shut.
67856: The iron gate is open.
67872: Tiny birds and butterflies flutter past your face as you occupy the
gorgeous Garden of Eden. The flower beds would make Alan Titchmarsh weep onto
Charlie Dimmock's shoulder and the trees are tall and mysterious enough to put
any magic forest to shame. The effect is spoiled somewhat by the rusty metal
bench.
68088: Someone appears to have scratched 'Judas Woz Ere' into the paintwork.
68140: You can't understand it, it's written in some ancient language. Oh well,
it's probably just gossip and sensationalism.
68228: You unfold the paper and something falls out onto the floor.
68272: There is nothing more of interest in the paper.
68308: It's a small rubber disc with a picture of a boat on it.
68348: You are standing on the platform of the Heaven train station. Gazing
over the edge of the platform you see that the track is floating unsupported in
the blue sky, and beyond it nothing fills the air but fluffy clouds. A train is
currently occupying the station with 'STRAIGHT TO HELL' stencilled on the side.
68572: The conductor stops you, asking to see your ticket.
68608: The conductor, a fat angel with a peaked cap, eyes you balefully.
68656: There is just no reasoning with the man.
68684: You show the season ticket to the conductor, who smiles unsettlingly.
"Season ticket to hell, eh?" he says. "Well, rather you than me. Go ahead." He
waves you on and you enter the train of the damned. 

 The interior of the
train is not a good omen for the challenges that face you. The decor is in an
early gothic bloodstained style, and the seats range from boiling sulphur to
maggots. You opt for one of the less unsettling seats and take your place among
the wailing Damned on their hellish way. 

 After a completely miserable
journey the train comes to a halt in a station. A pair of hideous demons lead
most of the passengers off, but when they notice your season ticket and
unmistakable aura of the living you bear they decide you must have special
dispensation and leave you alone. You rub your neck thoughtfully, and step onto
the platform.
69280: This man will not respond to prezzies.
69308: A natural cavern provides the scene for your latest adventure. You are
on the banks of a enormous river, shrouded in mist, black as oil. You hear the
wails of the Damned mingled with the plink of water from stalactites dripping
into the main body of water. A little wooden jetty extends from the bank, and a
large bronze bell dangles from a steel support. The train back to Heaven is to
your west.
69584: You get back onto the train and opt to sit on the floor this time as you
are transported quickly and efficiently back to the place where nice people go
when they die.
69700: There doesn't appear to be any way across the river.
69738: You step gingerly onto the boat.
69764: The dock doesn't look stable. You decide not to go on until you are sure
it's safe.
69824: The bell is slightly cracked and hangs from its support loosely. It must
have been used an awful lot.
69896: You bang the bell for all you're worth. Nothing immediately happens.
69948: The Ferryman looks at you oddly. He's already there, Arthur!
69996: The river extends far off into the distance. The far bank is not
visible.
70048: You dive into the river, and never resurface. As to your exact fate,
no-one can be sure. Legend is unspecific as to what happens when you dive into
the river Styx. You don't survive the process anyway, so what do you care?
70206: A chain rises out of the water, extending from the bank to far in the
distance, and is pulled taut.
70278: A shadowy shape seems to be approaching through the mist.
70322: A wooden boat approaches the bank, rippling the water around it, and
bumps gently against the bank.
70396: A ferry is waiting on the bank of the river.
70428: The boat seems to made from petrified wood, and a sticker on the back
reads 'my other boat's a trireme'.
70502: You step gingerly onto the boat.
70528: You stand unsteadily on the boat as it bobs up and down in the dark
waters of the river. The solid stone bank outside the boat looks more than
inviting.
70632: The Ferryman stands here expectantly.
70660: Completely covered in a black robe, only boney hands extrude from the
form of the ferryman, one of which is outstretched, expecting something.
70760: He (you presume it is a man) will not reply.
70792: Well, that's a refreshing way to behave when facing the Ferryman.
70840: The Ferryman's skeletal hand closes around the token, and he motions for
you to sit. With a long pole he shoves the boat away from the bank, and with
infinite patience rows the vessel across the water. Eventually the mist thins
and you can see the far bank, and soon enough the ferry bumps against the rocky
beach. You thank the Ferryman and step off onto reassuringly hard ground.
71108: You flash the gold ticket again, the Ferryman visibly tuts, and motions
for you to sit. As he paddles you across the river for another time, you get
the feeling that he thinks you're abusing his good nature.
71252: The river slurps in its container behind you and you thank whoever is
watching that you are across it. Basically the east bank looks remarkably like
the westbank, except for the path leading east.
71386: You flash your season ticket and the Ferryman nods understandingly. He
motions for you to sit and once again rows you across the river. You hop off
onto the west bank of the river, and thank him again.
71532: A ferry is waiting on the bank of the river.
71564: The boat seems to made from petrified wood, and a sticker on the back
reads 'my other boat's a trireme'.
71640: You are in some sort of small man-made (or demon-made) chamber between
two large underground caverns. Archways lead east and west, and there appears
to be some sort of partially rubbed-away message above the east archway.
71796: You step gingerly around the snoring hellhound and go through the
imposing stone archway.
71860: Cerberus snarls at you as you try to move in that direction, so you
carefully edge back. No harm done.
71932: You can make out a few words and letters; 'Abando', 'ye' and 'enter
here' in that order. The rest is far too indistinct.
72024: Cerberus, the three-headed dog, is tethered to the wall.
72068: The big, black triple-skulled wolfhound growls and snarls in your
direction, but cannot reach you thanks to the tether that secures it to the
wall.
72172: The big, black triple-skulled wolfhound growls and snarls in your
direction, but cannot reach you thanks to the tether that secures it to the
wall.
72276: It's a small, cheap, red plastic dog dish with 'My Best Friend' written
on the side in big blue letters. It seems to be just out of the dogs' reach.
72384: You have difficulty with the moral dilemma in killing non-humans.
72432: You kick the poisoned drinky over to the baying dog, whereupon it tears
the bowl apart with its three heads and consumes the contents. After a short
while the knockout pills take effect and, literally as one beast, the three
heads whine and droop. Soon the monster just stiffens and falls over sideways,
then commences snoring loudly.
72664: You need to disguise it. The dog isn't the least bit interested.
72712: The ambrosia on its own won't incapacitate the creature.
72752: The current contents of the bowl would neither interest nor affect
Cerberus.
72808: Cerberus, the three-headed dog, is asleep on the floor.
72848: Tongues lolling, Cerberus almost looks cute. Almost.
72888: Tongues lolling, Cerberus almost looks cute. Almost.
72928: Let sleeping dogs lie. This is the first time I've been able to say that
in such an apt situation.
73000: This is a narrow stone ridge which pokes out over a huge pit, the bottom
of which is indistinct. A large sign on the far side of the room points down
into the chasm.
73116: The sign points downwards and reads 'Hell This Way. NO LIVING PEOPLE
PLEASE!'.
73188: You lean forward and peer over the edge of the pit, staring down into
the blackness. Nothing is visible but the darkness.
73272: You grimace, stand on the very edge and, sweating, hurl yourself down
into the darkness. No invisible bridges this time as you plummet through layer
upon layer of dark shadows, each darker than the last.
73414: You don't know how long you fall for. Could have been hours, could have
been days. Just as you begin to wonder if you have made a big mistake, the
bottom of the pit becomes visible - a circle of dark red rock swarms into view.
You brace yourself for landing, and feel a squeezing pain in your chest as the
suicide pill takes affect. You clutch at yourself and howl in pain just before
everything goes black... 

 You awaken face-down on rough, crimson rock, and
you feel oddly warm. As you struggle up to your feet, you realise that you are
now dressed in a ragged leather tunic. Your skin is pale and your head hurts.
You realise with a heavy heart that you have died, and have taken your place
among the Damned. You look around at the cavernous realm of the Underworld,
scowl at the stalactites and wince at the screams of anguish. Now how are you
ever going to get back to the land of the living?
74046: Just as you are getting into the whole falling business, a spooky laugh
echoes around the pit and the air around you becomes red and warm. Stabbing
pains invade your head and your blood seems to boil in your veins. When your
vision clears, you find yourself back on the edge of the pit. 

 "Bollocks,"
you quip.
74268: The scent of boiling sulphur fills your nostrils as you stand in the
middle of a huge, hellish plain. The dirt beneath your feet seems to snap and
bite at you, and the wails of the tortured Damned grate at your nerves. Paths
lead north, south and east.
74444: You are surrounded by tall ridges which impede movement to the north,
east and west, but a path leads back south. Judging by the burn marks on the
floor something quite energetic and very hot goes on here quite regularly.
74596: It's one of those Viking hats with the two horns.
74632: A gigantic formation of red rock rises out of the ground here, a
formation which could conceivably be described as throne-shaped. Human skulls
with the obligatory snakes crawling through them decorate the chair on the
armrests and headrest. A very welcome path leads north.
74820: Satan is here, sitting on his throne.
74848: Satan, Beezlebub, Prince of Darkness... whatever you want to call him,
he's here, and parking his enormous behind on his satanic chair.
74948: "Go away, little human, you bore me."
74980: "What makes you think I want that back? Put it in the Cracks of Gehenna,
or something."
75576: . Oh, well. Satan is well known for his sense of humour. Just be
grateful he didn't drop you off in the sea, or a volcano, or in the middle of a
mountain. 

 Well, Arthur, you've done it. You've destroyed Hell's Cheesecake
once and for all, and foiled Dr. Diablo's plans once again. It's going to be
long walk back, but at least you'll have time to reflect on what a debt the
world owes to you. 

 Sigh.
75872: "Go away, little human, you bore me."
75968: This chap will not respond to prezzies.
75996: Nearly beneath your feet and adding to the somewhat stifling air of the
place is a river of lava, possibly one of a vast network of rivers. Rather
uncomfortable mortal souls flow past, apparently not enjoying themselves much.
The path leads back west.
76172: What can be said? It's a horizontal flow of molten rock. It's also very
warm.
76232: You hurl the cake into the lava and it disappears in a burst of smoke.
Now it's horrors will never again be unleashed into the living world.
77960: endeavoured almost constantly to keep him in this universe. He was just
that little bit less dangerous over here than over there. 

 "What master plan
has he hatched this time?" inquired Agent Kastanet, twiddling with her ID tags.


 "He means to use the mystical powers of a certain artefact, the location of
which has been known to us for many decades now." 

 "You don't mean..." began
Agent Llewellyn. 

    "... Hell's Cheesecake?" finished everyone else. 

 "The
very same," said Agent Pemberton smugly. "As you know, the security in the
Temple of Hell's Cheesecake is so tight that only one of us can get through,
but as you know Diablo is a resourceful one. One of us will have to go to the
temple and fetch the Cheesecake back here before Diablo gets there first." 


"Who?" 

 "Who else? The only one of us who has skived off all his assigned
missions for the last six months, and just sits on his arse all day stuffing
his face with pizza?" 

 Agent Arthur Yahtzee looked up from his meal,
pepperoni smeared over his face, and said, "Why's everyone staring at me?"
