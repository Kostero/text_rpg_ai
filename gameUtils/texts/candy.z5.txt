Mother has just dropped you off at your slightly eccentric Aunt
Lidia's house, or "pad" as Lidia calls it. Auntie Lidia told you she is
catching forty winks and not to disturb her beauty sleep. Now you can get back
to your goal in life...
48440: First, pretending he's Mr. Peanut, you use your vivid imagination too
hold a mock trial for him. He's found guilty and is sentenced to digestion. You
pop the slightly mildewed goober into your mouth, making you little screaming
noises for Mr. Peanut the whole time.
48643: The carpet greedily eats it.
48666: Carefully, you get on all fours, then lower yourself into the world
below the carpet...
48891: Of course, it's covered with hair, but it's candy nevertheless.
48940: Alas, nothing is found in the hairy enigma. You don't think your hand
ever rally touched the floor. How deep is this carpet?
49035: The carpets wall to wall.
49080: With a delicit yank, the cotton candy is yours.
49127: The hair is fastened to the ball like your limbs to your body. You don't
mind much as the shaggy threads give it charecter and by no means deters your
want to devour it.
49271: With a quick flick of the wrist, the jawbreaker is yours!
49322: Not one to prolounge pleasure, you stick the hairy jawbreaker into your
pink little mouth and swallow. It almost gets stuck halfway through your
esophigas, but you manage to get it down into your gastric juices.
49499: You find a single forgotten chocolate covered peanut within one of the
wrappers. Score!
49591: The window opens to let the howling winds in. You quickly shut it.
49644: The window isn't open.
49671: You see a candy fish deep within the darkness under the fridge.
49720: Not with that lock.
49743: You reach for it, and can almost touch it, but you don't. You better
keep drinking your milk. You think the red ones are grape flavor anyway, so you
prolly wouldn't like it. Too sour.

52724: You can't go that way.
52890: -- Mephiskaphales, "Mephiskaphales"
52920: The darkness is scary. You don't believe in the boogie man...but what
it?
52976: Just your average year old chocolate covered peanut. Covered in
chocolate even.
53032: Your very own stomach.
53048: Your not quite sure what a foyer is, but you are most certain you are in
one. Auntie has told you enough times. It's a pleasant enough room, with a
carpet like a shaggy dog and nice wallpaper showing pictures of little fairies
playing. To the south is the door to outside. There are also stairs leading up
and exits to the east and west.
53284: The door is locked from the inside. Odd. Not supposed to go outside
anyway.
53340: A very spirally staircase. Looking at it makes you dizzy.
53384: The wallpaper is very pretty. There are Fairy folk playing instruments
and dancing all around. It's all set on a generic background pattern of
criss-crossing snakes, each eating the one in front of it. No candy here.
53536: The door to outside, where your not supposed to go.
53572: It reminds you of "The Shaggy Dog" by Disney. It reaches from wall to
wall and is a remarkable 6 inches deep. It's up to your shins, and it's as if
your wading in the carpet. It would be very easy to loose something in this
ocean of shag.
53744: You are in the midst of the white monster. Your sure that if you dropped
anything it could definaintly be found here. It's not that interesting down
here, or not what you would excpect. No Fraggles, and the roots of the shags
are pretty nasty.
53916: A wild patch of cotton candy has taken up root here.
53952: Judging from the mold you'd guess that this mold is circa 1977. A good
year for cotton candy, quite a find. Luckilly, it seems as if its roots arn't
that deep.
54068: A hairy jawbreaker.
54084: Entagled in the shag is a lone jawbreaker.
54116: This hallway contains pictures you sent your Aunt. It flows east to
west.
54168: On closer look, though they look like the things you did in your YMCA
art class, they are indeed not. Some are just scribles, blank peices of paper,
sea shells, candy wrappers, a crayon doodle, kleinex and one is just a tin can
taped to the wall with the price tag still on it: $500. Hmm.. maybe you'll
start an art show when you get back home.
54416: The tin can is ancient, and simply says SPAM on it.
54456: Fortintly you lost your cold, as this tissue looks old and too rough for
your delicate nose.
54520: You definantly like the doodle more than the scrible. If your eyes don't
decieve you the single color used is your favorite: Burnt Siena.
54620: The candy wrappers stick off the paper, teazing with their one time
contents.
54676: Not very pretty shells, and not a conch in sight, though the periwinkles
are cute.
54736: The blank peice of paper has a spotlight highlighting it.
54776: Just some ziggy, zaggy, lines. Auntie put this one in a solid gold
frame.
54832: From this window you can spy the outside. It looks green. And sunny. You
suddenly want to play Nintendo.
54908: Your Aunt is renowned for her slim figure. She's been dieting for 48
years and has used many methods, which can be seen lying about in this room.
There's that Gwenni Kraig refrigerator lock she got for loosing her fourth
pound. On the counter top is a for home use "ankle fat reduction suite", though
it looks like a tiny lipo-sucker to your eyes. Next to it sits one of those
long cigars that women smoke. Finally, on the floor is a knife with some
instructions next to it. Your hopes of finding candy shrink closer to despair.
55280: The knife looks pretty sharp. You feel like running with it while
holding it upward.
55416: Try as you might the fridge is impossible to open due to the blasted
Gwenni Kraig lock. It was built to fend off four hundred pounds of raging
estrogen, thus you are just a minor threat.
55578: Its red in color.
55716: Of course she never does and says its too keep skinny, though you think
she resembles a wraith quite a bit. Of course, your not sure what a wraith is.

Peer pressure and socialization drive many young women to

beauty. Many die as result of eating disorders and thousands more are
physically and mentally scarred for life. While society recognizes such
disorders as harmful the cosntant brainwashing propaganda is still allpervasive
in the media, fashion and beauty industries.
