40257: Not that way you can't.
40307: You achieve nothing by this.
40338: Futile.
40345: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
40394: You talk to yourself a while.
40417: This provokes no reaction.
40445: There is no reply.
40465: Nothing is on sale.
40511: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
40549: Time passes.
40565: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
40654: On the ground is the ancient jeweled amulet that you "borrowed" from Mr.
Meshugge.
40718: You venture out onto the sands and rapidly lose sight of camp.
40774: Lying on the ground is a brass torch of the "self-igniting" type. The
ignite button is on the handle.
40850: There is a shovel lying here.
40882: The torch flickers a few times and then glows steadily.
40926: You are in Francisco Roboff's tent. The place is bare except for the
emergency signal radio and Roboff's toilet in one corner. There is a note taped
to the tent wall.
41054: The toilet is open. A hole goes down the bowl into darkness.
41109: You clamber into the toilet bowl and climb down through the roof of the
buried pyramid. You drop to the floor.
41216: Ecchhh! You don't have a reason to do anything like that.
41262: You have stooped to a new low by snooping around toilet bowls. However,
when you raise the lid, you find a dark hole going down.
41358: "Hi. Sorry about running off so suddenly but you know how it is... With
luck, you will die, but I want you to have something to do while you starve so
I'll
41473: tell you how to find the pyramid. Oh, I didn't mention that I found it
two weeks ago? I never got in because the door is opened by putting that amulet
of yours
41691: You can't radio the plane now! You don't even have the coffin yet!
41764: You have stumbled over the encampment. Sheer accident.
41832: You have stumbled over the encampment. Sheer accident.
41900: You have stumbled over the encampment. Sheer accident.
41968: You have stumbled over the encampment. Sheer accident.
42021: It falls and is lost forever in the sands.
42097: Ok. As it slips in, the stone slab moves aside, dumping you into a pit.
You look up and see the amulet falling into a machine that wraps it, addresses
it to F. Roboff, and takes off on jets.
42255: "Thanks for the amulet! It only took me a few days to make this little
set-up. If you really want to get to the pyramid, retrace your steps back to
camp after
42368: the pit caves in (which should happen soon) and open my toilet. You see,
I really found the pyramid with a mass sensor when we moved in and I built my
42475: tent over it. The toilet conceals a secret passage down into the
pyramid, which I have been looting for weeks. Most of the easy stuff is in my
private safe in
42586: Miami by now, but I left you a few goodies. Including the gold coffin,
which I never found. When you get tired of poking around you can use the
42689: emergency radio in my tent. It'll call a plane to pick you up. Have
fun!
   -Roboff."
42758: You hear a rumbling and look up as the sides of the pit collapse. You
manage to stay on top, and you end up in the desert again.
42867: This room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the
center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to
the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass
points.
43035: This room is a conic surface with exits at even multiples of 90 degrees.
In the center is a regular square pyramid with a narrow vertex angle.
43138: You scramble up the obelisk and manage to crawl into the hole. After
some more squirming, you reach the toilet.
43229: The obelisk suddenly glows and a great voice speaks out of it (not the
voice that you've been talking to already.) "Ahhh-ha! A gold rectangular solid!
43540: About this point, your mind goes numb. You feel RAHNgons growing in your
blood-stream. You collapse on the ground, thinking only...
43644: I love geometry...
I love geometry...
43715: The obelisk is a monument to the great RAHN. The inscription starts:
43799: and the theorems; we shalt thank RAHN. For RAHN hath said 'Between any
two points there shalt be but one line'; and he found it good. For RAHN hath
said
43922: if two planes intersecteth, they shalt form but one straight line'; and
he found it good. For RAHN hath said..."
It goes on like this for a long time.
44037: When you manage to break the trance, your mind is numbed and full of
RAHN's strange commandments.
44137: You step onto the swinging platform.
44172: You step out of the hallway. However, the platform is to the
44220: right now, so you plummet 65 feet and splat. What a mess.
44323: You step off the platform to the east hall.
44379: You step off the platform to the west hall.
44526: There seems to be an invisible bar sticking out of the northeast wall of
the pit. It sweeps you off the platform into the pit.
44703: You bang your nose on the pit wall.
44736: You step off the platform into empty space. You plummet 65 feet and
splat into the pit floor.
44943: You step onto the swinging platform.
44977: You step out of the hallway. However, the platform is to the
45025: right now, so you plummet 65 feet and splat. What a mess.
45141: Sitting on the disk is:
45198: The key won't stay down.
45243: Ok. The disk sinks several feet down its shaft. This uncovers a small
hole that sprays out gas.
45350: The key is stuck to the disk with a dot of wax, which you pull off. Odd
-- the key seems to have negative weight! With the lift of the key removed, and
the extra weight of
45489: , the disk sinks several feet down its shaft. This uncovers a small hole
that sprays out gas.
45574: The key is stuck to the disk with a dot of wax, which you pull it off
of. Odd -- the key seems to have negative weight. With the lift of the key
removed, the disk sinks a few inches. However, there is no other effect. You
have actually survived a trap!
45753: Ok. The disk rises a few inches as you remove the weight.
45801: Ok. The disk dips a few inches under the extra weight.
45846: There is an ornate iron key stuck to the ceiling here just within reach.
45903: The key won't stay down.
45932: That wouldn't be a good idea out here.
45971: The key rises to the ceiling.
45998: There is a small figure of a demon in carved gold here!
46061: The pentacle contains:
46106: There is a sphere of polished and faceted obsidian here!
46170: The weight of the various bricks and cubes you are holding overbalances
a hidden pivot in the floor. You are dumped into a pit full of snakes.
46274: At the south wall is a large stone block with three stone disks embedded
on top. The disks appear to be slidable up and down. Above the disks is
suspended a glass tube stretching from wall to wall.
46418: There is a tiny pebble on the floor.
46469: Sitting on the left disk is:
46528: The key won't stay down.
46550: You shouldn't have done that. The impact on the left disk sets both side
disks swinging, until one smashes the tube. The gas inside pours out.
46683: With the weight on the left disk gone, and no extra weight on the middle
disk, the disk on the right shoots up and smashes the tube. Green gas pours
out.
46799: The disks unbalance briefly, but the pebble weighs down the whole system
so the tube is not touched.
46897: Sitting on the middle disk is:
46960: The key won't stay down.
46999: ahmghm is too much. The middle disk drops down, and the side disks shoot
up and smash the tube. Gas sprays out.
47136: That was not smart. With the extra weight of the pebble removed, the
empty side disk shoots up and smashes the tube. Gas pours out.
47239: Ok. The pebble's small weight moves the center disk down slightly.
47293: The disks return to their original positions.
47353: Sitting on the right disk is:
47412: The key won't stay down.
47434: You shouldn't have done that. The impact on the right disk sets both
side disks swinging, until one smashes the tube. The gas inside pours out.
47568: With the weight on the right disk gone, and no extra weight on the
middle disk, the disk on the right shoots up and smashes the tube. Green gas
pours out.
47687: The disks unbalance briefly, but the pebble weighs down the whole system
so the tube is not touched.
47762: There is a solid gold brick lying here!
47794: There is a cube of solid silver lying here!
47836: The platform slowly moves down a shaft below it. In the other alcove the
other platform slowly moves up, counterbalancing the one you are on.
47951: The platform moves back up to the alcove level. In the other alcove, you
see the other platform moving back down until both of the platforms are even.
48063: As the other platform moves down from the hole in the ceiling, you see a
small robot standing on it. When it gets down to the floor, it looks at you,
says
48174: "Ex-trrr-mnnn-ate", points an arm at you, and turns you into a small
pile of monatomic dust.
48254: There is a huge diamond lying on the ground!
48295: The door is open.
48340: You see something glimmering behind the door. You'll have to close the
door to get it.
48406: The door is closed.
48450: Leaving so soon? Before you open the chest?
48496: The door slams open. It is apparently on a very strong spring. If you
were on the other side, you would have been slammed into the wall. As it is,
the steel door-knob slams into the inside wall.
48644: The door slams open. You barely avoid the swinging knob. Instead, the
steel knob hits the wall with a bang.

The wall seems to be made of flint.
48759: You reach inside the room, grab the steel doorknob, and pull. The spring
is strong, but you eventually manage to get the door shut.
48876: After much tugging, you manage to get the door shut. Behind it is a
brass needle that you might use to unlock the chest.
49006: On the ground is a long brass needle.
49039: The chest is closed and locked.
49062: The chest is open.
49102: The chest contains:
49190: There is a click and the chest lid pops open. Inside is a priceless
dorkmid! As you stare at it, you notice the smell of coal gas leaking out.
49294: There is an invaluable dorkmid here!
49327: You jump over the weak spot in the center, landing on the other side of
the chasm.
49388: Hmmm... The other rim seems to be made of a peculiar type of rock. Some
type of talc or damp plaster. You slide back into the pit.
49497: The bridge appears to have a small weak spot in the middle, about two
feet wide. You break through it and plummet. Next time try jumping or
something.
49606: Yuk! You have fallen into a pit full of gray sticky glue.
49654: Each gadget has a large triggerplate and two darts sticking out. As you
look it over, you brush the plate and the darts zock you in the hand. Ouch!
49778: Each gadget has a large triggerplate and two darts sticking out. When
you touch the plate, the darts zock you in the hand. Ouch!
49874: Sitting on the floor in a clear space is a cut-crystal bowl.
49919: The bowl contains:
49984: As you do, several of the quartz chips spill onto the floor. Some hit
metal gadgets, triggering them. Darts fly. Some darts hit more gadgets. More
darts fly. After a few seconds of this, you have been punctured several million
times.
50154: You climb out of the pit, dripping goop. You are coated with glue.
50210: You climb out of the pit, dripping goop. You are coated with glue.
50266: Yuk! You have fallen into a pit full of gray sticky glue.
50319: The door is open. A cascade of fur spills through.
50359: The door is closed.
50388: You can't close it for the fur.
50423: The door swings open. A cascade of fur pours out, completely covering
you and sticking to the glue.
50561: Sitting on the shelf is:
50621: If you hadn't noticed, you've been walking on glass with furry feet.
This will produce a large static charge. The metal shelf is grounded into the
stone wall. And iron conducts electricity...
50827: If you hadn't noticed, you've been walking on glass with furry feet.
This will produce a large static charge. The necklace is sitting on a metal
shelf which is grounded into the stone wall. And silver conducts electricity...
51042: You climb up the ladder to a hole at the top of the shaft.
51098: On the floor is a small coin-bag made of leather. It appears to have
something in it.
51162: It is a bag for a matching set of fourteen 23-zorkmid coins. However,
the set is worthless when incomplete and the bag only has
51350: cross. You can turn the wheel by walking north or south.
51391: Equally spaced around the rim are twelve coin-holders. Some have gold
coins in them.
51467: The hole is aligned with the shaft, so you climb through it and down the
ladder.
51528: You have rotated the wheel so that the hole is not aligned with the
shaft. You can't go down.
51633: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole
in the rim that you entered by has moved.
51757: The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole
in the rim that you entered by has moved.
51864: You've already taken the coin at this position.
51904: You're not holding the coin bag to put the coin into.
51965: You pick up the coin and put it in your bag.
52015: The coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it.
52053: The coin-holder at your feet is empty.
52091: The hole is at the bottom of the wheel. Below it is the shaft that you
entered this room by.
52165: The hole is slightly up the north side.
52203: The hole is less than half-way up the north side.
52249: The hole is half-way up the north side.
52287: The hole is more than half-way up the north side.
52339: The hole is almost to the top on the north side. Behind it is a hole
from which water is pouring very fast. The water turns the wheel back to its
original position, then pours down the hole. You are taken with it.
52497: The hole is at the top of the wheel.
52533: The hole is almost to the top on the south side.
52577: The hole is more than half-way up the south side.
52623: The hole is half-way up the south side.
52661: The hole is less than half-way up the south side.
52707: The hole is slightly up the south side.
52743: The door is swinging closed.
52767: The door is closed.
52794: The door is apparently on a very weak spring. You open it, but it begins
swinging shut the moment you release it.
52908: The door has swung shut.
53026: In walking, you have bumped into and broken some stalagmites. They are
hollow and water starts pouring out, slowly filling the room.
53126: In walking, you have bumped into and broken some stalagmites. They are
hollow and water starts pouring out, slowly filling the room.
53226: It reads "Panic Button: Push in case of flood to exit."
53281: Click. Fear gas sprays out of the walls, causing you to panic and run
for the locked door. You break most of the stalagmites in the rush, so the
water is up to your chest by the time you reach the door. When you hit it, you
break through. The water washes you down the hall and through the blades.
53499: The Great Door is open.
53551: You turn the iron key and the tomb door swings open. The musty smell of
old comic books pours out.
53662: On the floor is the solid-gold coffin that contains the bodies of the
Lord -- and all his riches! All you have to do is get it back to the
encampment!
53775: Absolutely not! All you want to do is get it back to the encampment.
53829: It's too heavy to pick up. Perhaps you could push it around.
53881: Which way do you want to push the coffin?
53931: You lean on the coffin, and it scrapes along the floor.
54016: You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you
wouldn't believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete
silence instead of the usual morning complaints
54153: of the workers and Roboff's usual shouting. This can only mean one thing
- Roboff must have finally run off on you. Panicked, you look around and see
your amulet lying on the floor. At least
54290: Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also
had the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to
get out of this one?

54613: First-time players should type "about".
54755: Not to put too fine a point on it, I wrote this when I was about
fifteen. In BASIC.
54866: Furthermore, the game abounds with in-jokes so obscure that even I
probably don't recognize all of them any more. Some of them are publically
accessible; some less so. (Let's just say that a certain friend of mine was
deeply, er, moved by eighth-grade geometry class.)
55061: In doing this Inform port, I have manfully resisted the urge to improve
the game. Spelling and punctuation errors have been fixed, but no descriptive
text has been added. I didn't quite have the nerve to cripple Graham's Inform
library, so the parser does not suck, but just about everything else you could
want in a game is lacking here. Just about every movable object has no
description. Synonyms are sparse. Variety of text is a lost cause. Get the
idea?
55386: Enough castigation.
55537: Enchanter.
55549: We would then give a "pirated" copy of this new treasure to our friends,
crawl back into our basements, and snicker mightily.
55638: You may get some idea of when this occurred by noting that we decided to
call the "sequel"
55706: Enchanter II.
56010: ". Heh heh.
56059: Enchanter II.
56075: It began plausibly (or so youthful memory tells me -- probably it's
actually as embarrassing as this game.) I imitated Infocom's Apple II
interpreter rather well, I think, considering that I was using BASIC. The
player began by being sent back to the ruined castle of Krill to destroy
something in need of destruction. There was a hidden stairway under the altar
in that nasty temple, which led down to a few underground rooms. A little more
exploration turned up a scroll labelled "Travel through time"...
56442: When you succumb and cast the spell, a tall blue box with a flashing
light on top appears in mid-air, drops on you, and squashes you.
56539: At that point, of course, everything fell apart. Your hunger and thirst
(which had been growing earlier, in keeping with
56641: ) became a sudden need to take a leak. (Keep in mind that I was perhaps
fourteen.) More rooms opened up. Silly things happened, of which I cannot
recall a single one. In the end, you acquired a "resignation code," located a
shop, and found that the item you needed had a price equal to that code number.
When you typed that number as part of the purchase command, the game dropped
into the distinctive losing display of
56957: a deeply disturbed Apple II game of the time. (Actually, it's a deeply
disturbed game for any time. I wish I still had a copy.) The closing message,
"You may have lost -- but we have gained," turned into Dave's name and mine,
and that was the end of
57145: Enchanter II.
57163: Time passed and more Infocom games appeared. Dave and I started drawing
up plans for a new Infobom title, a parody of
57279: Expelled.
57795: routines. In the end someone repairs you and you spend the rest of your
life processing garbage. (Whatever keys you typed after that point, the letters
appearing at the prompt always spelled out "TAKE GARBAGE <Return> PROCESS
GARBAGE <Return> TAKE GARBAGE <Return> ..." I was rather proud of that effect.)
58070: never really got off the ground. BASIC and my programming skills were
not up to the task of a
58388: Inhumane.
58530: a role-playing supplement which you can probably still find in gaming
stores. I had invented a decent collection of embarrassingly fatal dungeon
traps, so I figured I might as well implement them...
58673: This is the result.
58692: Those were the only text-game parodies we actually worked on. Naturally,
we had a much longer list of Infobom
59062: as well. Shows what I remember.
59133: by the Zarfian Interactive Fiction Rating System. It is possible to get
stuck, but only in one place, very early in the game. However, for reasons
which will become clear, I can't promise that you'll never die....
59299: Well, there's Graham Nelson. You've probably heard of him by now.
59382: You've probably heard of that too.
59411: There's Richard Merryman, who found me the Apple II disk image of this
game years after I lost my original, and also dug the source code and data out
and into a sensible format.
59624: You are floating disembodied in absolute blackness. Time passes at a
strange, relative rate. After an infinite/infinitesmal time, you sense a
presence near
59735: you. A voice speaks, resounding in your head as in a hollow gourd...
59817: come to steal my treasure. How boring. Most of it was taken by that
other guy who had the sense to avoid the nastier traps... But I am getting
pretty tired
59928: of guarding what's left. I don't suppose that you have any chance of
thinking your way through my traps, of course. But I'll let you try, and I
won't even
60041: vaporize you when you try to leave. In fact, I'll make you a deal. If
you prove to me that you are an incompetent Harry Sullivan by getting yourself
killed by
60283: You are back in the infinite blackness. Eventually the voice returns,
senses you disgustedly, and speaks.
60361: q."That hardly counts as being killed by a trap, you know. Even you
could have gotten farther into that situation.
60460: "You already got frotzed that way once. How about something more
original?
60644: "Don't panic... Don't panic... Don't panic... It's not good for you...
60940: "Good... I would have thought you knew your eighth grade science.
61207: The voice that you heard when you died speaks. "Score? You mean how well
you've done?
61295: Your score is 0 out of a possible 300. This gives you the rank of Novice
Adventurer.
61400: You don't seem to have really gotten fooled by any traps yet. Maybe
there is hope for you."
61472: You've only gotten killed by one trap. Not bad."
61514: You've been killed by two traps. That isn't really so bad."
61564: Three deathtraps have zocked you so far. You're beginning to seem rather
dumb."
61628: You've stumbled into four traps. You're not looking very good."
61682: You've been killed by five deathtraps so far. You're getting pretty good
at dying, aren't you?"
61758: Six traps have killed you. I am forced to the conclusion that you are a
high-grade moron at best."
61834: All right, you've set off seven out of nine traps. Make that a low-grade
moron who is stoned on nitrolabe."
61918: All right, that makes eight traps. If you manage to kill yourself on the
last one, I'll give you the key."
62018: That does it. I give up. You are a complete Sullivan of an imbecile.
There is no hope for you. Here is that #%$# key; take the coffin and get out!"
62136: You've proved yourself a hopeless imbecile. Take that #$%#% coffin and
leave."
62368: You don't have a shovel, genius.
62401: Useless.
62415: The ground is too hard for digging here.
62449: Why? There's nothing down there, remember, genius? Remember Roboff's
toilet? Hmmm?
62523: You dig for about two hours, making a big hole. The hole is completely
empty, so you spend another two hours filling it in.
62610: You begin digging. After about two hours you strike stone! You rapidly
clear off a stone slab about 10 feet down from the surface.
62900: You can't go that way.
62968: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
63000: As good-looking as ever.
63032: It is very dark. Before you can do anything, something begins gnawing on
you.
63088: You are in your tent in the encampment. The tent appears to have been
completely cleaned out. It is very hot in here and getting hotter. The tent
flap to the south is open.
63208: This is the center of your camp. The entire place seems to be completely
deserted. You can see Roboff's tent to the south and the storage tent west.
East is open desert.
63328: This is where the party kept all its supplies. However Roboff seems to
have cleaned everything out that was of any use. Several arrows of Da-Glo paint
on the wall attract your attention to the empty food and water chests.
63484: It is an ordinary electric torch with an auto-ignite button on the
handle.
63536: The radio has only one button, which will start a distress/locator
beacon.
63588: All you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight. You are sweating
like a pig.
63648: You are at the bottom of the hole you just dug. The floor of the hole is
a stone slab with a little slot in it. You can nearly smell the riches that
must be buried beneath your feet!
63776: What?! Leave when the riches of the pyramid await you?
63816: You see nothing interesting about the little slot.
63852: This is a sandy pit with stone walls. You are not likely to be able to
climb out. The only thing here is a note taped to the wall.
63944: Fat chance.
63956: Stairways go down to the north, south, east, and west. Which way do you
want to go?
64016: The east/west corridor branches to the south here.
64052: West is a large round pit about 65 feet deep. Running down the center of
the pit is an axle with a platform attached at the level of this hall. The
platform is swinging around the wall of the pit. You see another hall west
across the pit.
64220: You are standing on a wooden platform swinging clockwise around the pit
wall. The floor is 65 feet down but halls leave the pit at this level on the
east and west sides.
64340: The pit with the swinging platform is east of this intersection. Halls
go north and south.
64404: In the center of this room is a stone block. There is a stone disk on
the top surface of the block. Directly above the disk is suspended a glass
globe just full of spiders and little snakes and scorpions. Exits are north and
south.
64564: The contents look nasty.
64584: This room is full of carved demons and devils doing nasty thing to
innocent people. There is quite a bit of gold-leaf fresco and bas-relief. Very
nice if you don't mind the subject matter. The only exit is south.
64736: This room is decorated in various textures of black stone. A hall leads
north. Carved on the floor is an ornate pentacle. This room is very depressing.
64844: The hall ends in an alcove to the south. The intersection in north.
Odd... The floor feels a bit shaky here. Nothing to worry about though.
64948: It seems to be filled with green gas.
64976: The corridor goes north to the stairs and south from here. There are
alcoves to the east and west. In the floor between the alcoves is a quartz
window.
65084: You can dimly see into a tiny room under this corridor. In the tiny room
rests a huge glittering diamond!
65160: This alcove is empty but the floor has a separate stone platform set in
it. The platform moves slightly when stepped on but does not move up or down.
Directly above the platform is a hole in the ceiling.
65300: This alcove has a stone platform set in the floor. The platform shifts a
little but does not move when you step on it. Sticking out of the platform is
an iron crank.
65416: You are on the crank platform at the bottom of the shaft under the
alcove. There is an opening to the east.
65492: This is a tiny room. The only exit is back west. You can see the quartz
window directly above your head.
65568: You are at the end of the hall. To the south is a wooden door with a
steel knob on it.
65628: This room is empty except for a small chest at one end. The only exit is
the door to the north.
65696: To the hall goes east from here. To the west is the stairway to the
round room. A narrow passage leads south.
65776: A wide chasm crosses the passage at this point. Fortunately someone has
built a wooden bridge across it. The narrow passage continues south past the
bridge and north to the intersection.
65904: The hall goes east and west from here and there is a doorway to the
north.
65956: This is the south end of a long room. The walls and floor and ceiling
are covered with thousands of metal gadgets that you might want to examine more
carefully. There is a path free of gadgets to the north end of the room.
66108: The room stretches away back south. The metal gadgets are clustered even
more densely here.
66172: You are in a deep pit up to your chin in sticky grayish glue. You can
probably climb out using a rough set of handholds on the east wall. (Probably
carved by a previous sucker.)
66296: There's no way up on that side.
66320: The hall ends in a door to the east. To the west is that pit of glue.
66372: You are wading through knee-deep piles of the fur that is stuck all over
you. The door is to the west is jammed open by more of the stuff. The hall
continues east.
66488: The walls of this east/west corridor are thick panes of glass over the
normal stone blocks. So is the floor which makes it hard to walk on your furry
feet.
66596: The hall ends in another glass-covered wall. On this wall is an iron
shelf bolted onto the glass. (Actually the bolts go through the glass into the
stone wall.)
66712: This is a landing on the stairway. You can go down to the north or up to
the south. A passage leads east.
66788: You are at the bottom of a ladder that goes up a shaft from here. To the
south is the stairway up.
66856: The hallway goes east and west here with a branch north.
66896: The north hall ends at a door. Stretched from wall to wall and floor to
roof in the hall are long thin metal blades that you have to worm between very
carefully.
67008: You are at the south end of a room. There is a door to the south. The
floor is covered with hundreds of stalagmites.
67092: This is the north end of the stalagmite room. On the north wall is a
button with something written on it. The only way out is back south.
67188: You are outside an ornate door with an ornate iron lock. The
hieroglyphics on the door seems to indicate that it leads into the central tomb
where the gold coffin is!
67304: This is the antechamber to the crypt where legends say the many bodies
of the Great Lord are buried. There is a brightly painted fresco running around
the chamber. The Great Door is west and the sacred crypt is south.
67456: The fresco depicts the pharaoh stepping into a tall blue box, carefully
inspecting a large machine and a pile of trash, eating a pizza, and laughing
his head off at someone who looks very much like you.
67596: At last! The tomb of the many bodies! Scattered around the room are
frescos that must represent the different bodies. The whole room is shockingly
valuable.
67708: The bodies depicted seems to decrease in age. The first is an old
geezer, the second is rather younger, the third is quite young and wearing a
scarf and a coat, etc.
