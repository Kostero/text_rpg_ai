79852: This dangerous act would achieve little.
79880: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
79940: Digging would achieve nothing here.
79968: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
79996: That would scarcely empty anything.

80980: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
81012: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,

81116: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.

82216: The hallway comes to an end here, with a very fancy-looking archway
leading out to the south. The rest of this godforsaken place lies beyond a
hallway to the north.
82332: An invisible force repels you! It must not be your turn to exit yet.
82380: It's your turn to leave. What a fine figure you will cut, emerging into
a world that probably makes far more sense than this one does!

82536: Hopefully that counter wraps around.
82564: That's your ticket out of here. You don't intend to let it out of your
possession.
82624: This is your ticket out of here, not some kind of meal ticket.
82776: Hallways lead east and west. The archway to the grand exit lies to the
south.
82844: You stand in a T-junction connecting three of this building's rooms.
82896: A hallway leads east, while the room extends to the west and north.

83848: Something about this room feels... stable, somehow, in a way that the

83940: A wooden door adorns the north wall. It is closed.

84028: A wooden door leads north into a small annex. It is open.
84072: A wooden door leads south back into the main area. It is open.
84116: It seems to be an advertisement for a horror movie. The tagline blares
"Watch if you dare! WHAT IS SEEN CANNOT BE UNSEEN."
84220: It is glued to the wall, and you can't get enough purchase to do any
real damage.
84280: A poster adorns the wall here.
84304: A wedge of sharp cheddar.
84324: Smoky and just strong enough to make a sandwich interesting without
overpowering it.
84384: Not bad, and it doesn't seem spoiled.
84412: That might not have been the most sanitary thing to do, but it was
certainly satisfying.
84476: Much of this area is taken up by a full-sized bed.
84512: It looks a bit rumpled after your nap.
84552: This area has been converted into an impromptu bedroom.
84590: You have been at this for awhile, haven't you? You stretch out a bit and
decide to maybe just rest your eyes a little, but before you know it you're
waking up from an impromptu nap.

You aren't completely sure how much time has
passed. You suppose it doesn't matter too much, in the end.
84812: This area seems designed to let people get dressed and made-up before
performances.
84872: It's cracked all across its surface.
84900: What a fine, adventurous figure you cut.
84932: Your hands are unbloodied, and you'd just as soon keep it that way.
84992: You put some impressive cracks in it, and miraculously manage to keep
your hands intact.
85056: There is a button on the wall here.
85084: It extends perhaps a centimeter from the wall.
85116: It is now flush with the wall after having been pressed.
85156: It has already been thoroughly pushed.
85184: You press the button and it locks into place with a firm "click."
85232: A mysterious rope hangs down here out of a tiny hole in the ceiling.
85280: You see nothing special about the rope beyond the mysterious fact of its
existence.
85340: Secret Belfry?
85352: This region appears to control something up above. You're not sure what
that could be.
85416: As you try to manipulate the rope into position to get a knot, the rope
goes slack, then taut, then retracts through the ceiling with sudden force.
85520: You grab it and try to pull it down. It yields for a moment, and then
retracts through the ceiling with sudden force.
85604: You grab it and try to rip it apart. It yields for a moment, and then
retracts through the ceiling with sudden force.
85688: The mere heat of your intention ignites it, and soon there's nothing
left. Pointlessly destructive, yes; plausibly irreversible, also yes; but you
do feel you have satisfied some basic need.
85824: The pail is made of faded blue plastic. There's a layer of pale green
crystals at the bottom, fine as sand.
85900: You have ample inventory space. You don't need to rely on some bucket to
help you organize stuff.
85968: The crystals don't want to stay contained. No sooner do they leave the
bucket do they end up scattered all about.
86048: The crystals end up scattered everywhere.
86080: There's a layer of pale green crystals at the bottom of the pail, fine
as sand.
86136: The crystals are scattered all about now.
86168: Cleaning up those crystals sounds suspiciously like work. No thanks.
86216: The crystals don't want to stay contained. No sooner do they leave the
bucket do they end up scattered all about.
86296: Cleaning up those crystals sounds suspiciously like work. No thanks.
86344: You spill the crystals all over the room as if you were rolling a
thousand tiny dice. Whee!
86408: I have no idea what you are talking about.
86440: A well-made hat, with fine colors and a jaunty tassel. It seems to be
your size.
86500: A television set squats here, tuned to a display the color of the sky.
86564: This part of the building seems set up to let people relax.
86608: It's an aging cathode-ray model television.
86640: It doesn't seem to be recieving a picture; just various shades of bright
blue.
86696: The only obvious control is a power switch.
86732: A mahogany table lends this area a touch of class.
86768: Inscribed on the table is an odd pattern. It's a series of three
triangles, with a square between the first two and a pentagon between the last
two.
86884: This part of the building is quite a bit fancier looking than the rest
of it. Perhaps it was used to entertain more important guests.
87036: Saving has been disabled. Enough of the puzzle is randomized that
staying within one iteration will lead only to suffering.
87124: You cannot RESTORE what was never SAVEd.
87160: You cannot UNDO in this game. Understand what you have wrought, and
RESET THE PUZZLE if necessary.
87242: Welcome to the Atrocitron! The Atrocitron is a non-traditional
interactive fiction experience. In particular...

The solution is different
each time you play.

The game can be rendered unwinnable without warning and
without indication that you have done so.

87784: . However, I also wanted to see if it was possible to break every
tradition of playing fair with the player while still, in the end, actually
playing fair.

I suppose this is also as good a place as any to note that while
I consider it fair to try to disassemble the game file to solve it, I intend
the easiest way to make progress to be to play the game.

More formally,
88044: the Atrocitron is an experiment with the player's role in an interactive
work. The usual way we talk about this is with the author and the player
collaborating to produce a story within the author's guidelines. There is,
however, a tradition of game performance that involves either ignoring or
subverting the designer's play and narrative intent to do something entirely
different - obviously evil runs that the game nevertheless scores as maximally
saintly, glitch runs that do everything out of order, and so on.

The
Atrocitron is presented to the player as a prop and a plaything, and the player
is invited to stay outside of it at several levels.

This wound up delaying its
release quite a bit as I realized that what I was really doing here was making
a
88570: instead of a deliberately awful work of IF. I've endeavored to make it
worthwhile in that guise as well.

Good luck!
