51140: mcom on or before June 30, 1998. Thanks for your patience!
51190: It has been a fierce battle, full of bold moves, daring attacks,
surprising gambits and heroic sacrifices. Throughout this, you've remained at
your starting point, patiently waiting for orders. But now that the
metaphorical dust has settled and most pieces have been exchanged, it finally
looks as if it is your turn. The White King and one of your Pawn colleagues
have managed to nail the Black King with his back to the edge of the board, but
they can't finish him off without help.

The White King calls you to action. It
is time to make your move.
51580: The game would be rather simple if you could move the Black pieces
around at will. Unfortunately you can't.
51684: The game would be rather simple if you could order the Black pieces
around. Unfortunately you can't.
51756: You're not giving the orders here, you just obey them.
51796: You can only capture enemy pieces.
51820: If you ever get to be a King, you can determine where the other pieces
go, but you're only a Pawn now.
51896: On your first move, you may choose to move two steps forwards instead of
just one. Would you like to do that?
51976: The chessboard is almost empty, now that most pieces have been
exchanged. Its surface is perfectly smooth, its 64 squares alternatingly deep
black and pearly white.
52092: That would be something: a pawn picking up the entire board!
52136: The White King looks impatient. "What are you waiting for? It's your
move!"
52194: The White King cries out in frustration: "You fool! You weren't supposed
to do that!"

The Black King, however, can't hide his pleasure. "I haven't got
any legal moves left. It's a stalemate!" He pats the White King on the
shoulder. "Seems like you don't win after all, old chap."
52412: The Black King scratches his head. "Hmmm. A difficult position - I might
have to sacrifice my last pawn. Let's see..."
52618: The Black King first looks surprised, and then starts to smile
triumphantly. The White King hides his face in his hands and groans. "Why do I
always get the stupid Pawns? It's not fair!"
52758: The Black King grins at his colleague. "It looks like we win anyway,
thanks to your Pawn!" He makes a chopping gesture with his hand, and the Black
Pawn moves in for the kill.

As you are removed from the board, you realize
that your move has lost the game: nothing can stop the Black Pawn from turning
into a Queen and winning now.

But that's no concern of yours anymore.
53032: The Black Pawn looks a bit surprised, and more than a little relieved,
that you didn't capture it. The White King nods his approval, however: "Well
done! Just continue north, and don't get distracted!"
53328: 3. The White King waves at you to continue your march.
53368: You take another step forwards. The Black King rather nervously orders
his pawn to continue.
53436: The Black Pawn continues south. It is now dangerously close to becoming
a Queen, and you can't help throwing some nervous glances in its direction. The
White King, however, encourages you: "Don't worry, they won't have the time to
do anything."
53616: The Black King gives you a worried look, but then turns to his own Pawn.
"Just one more step and you'll be promoted!"
53704: As the Black Pawn set foot on the first rank, it is surrounded by a
golden glow. With a fanfare from invisible trumpets, the Pawn is transformed
into a Queen! The White King looks at her, and snorts. "Impressive - but it
will not help a bit. Finish them off, Pawn!"
53898: You boldly advance and threaten the Black King. "Check!" you cry, and
the White King fills in: "...and mate!"

The Black King desperately looks
around for an escape, but can't find any. He extends his hand to his White
colleague. "It looks like you win again. But just wait - I'll get my revenge
next time!"

The White King pats your back. "Well done! I think there's a
vacancy as a Knight - I'll see if I can get you promoted in time for the next
game."
54252: That would take you over the edge of the board!
54288: It is deeply ingrained in your nature as a Pawn only to move forwards.
Onward, ever onward; that's your motto.
54368: You can't move that far in one move!
54460: You can only capture pieces that are immediately to your northwest or
northeast.
54696: . Each player starts the game with 16 pieces: 8
54764: .

White and Black take turns moving one of their own pieces. Each piece
has its own mode of movement (see the entries for each piece). If a piece moves
onto a square occupied by an enemy piece, the enemy piece is
54922: and removed from the game.

The Kings can't be captured. If an enemy
piece threatens to capture your King, the King is said to be in
55028: and must be moved. If the King can't move out of check, he is
55080: and the game is over.

The game can also end if one player has no legal
move to make. This is called
55158: In this game you take the part of one of the White chess pieces. You
start as a humble Pawn, but if you play well you may advance through the ranks,
all the way up to royal status.

As an individual piece, you will find that you
have very little influence on the game as a whole: you can only control your
own moves, not those of other pieces, and you will only move when told to do
so. Only when you've advanced all the way to King, you'll be in charge of the
entire game, and you'll be able to order the other pieces around.

During the
game, a diagram of the chess board with the current position is shown in the
status bar. Pieces are represented by capital letters (inverted for the Black
pieces).

The White Pawns move upwards in the diagram. To map the game into a
standard IF format, this direction has been labeled as 'north'.
55748: The Pawn is the least powerful piece. Pawns move only forward, except
when capturing enemy pieces: Pawns capture diagonally. So a White Pawn can only
move to the north, and capture pieces immediately to the northeast or northwest
(but not capture to the north, so a Black piece immediately to the north of a
White Pawn will block its progress).

Pawns move slowly, one square at a time,
except on their first move, when they have a choice of moving either one or two
squares.

When a Pawn reaches the last rank, it is
56160: The King is the most important piece of all, for if it is lost, the
entire game is lost. If an enemy piece threatens to capture your King, your are
said to be in
56280: , and you must immediately move the King somewhere where it isn't
threatened. The King must never move to a field where it is in check,
either.

The King can move one step in any direction.
56424: (from German, meaning "obligation to move") is used to describe a
situation where any move a player can make will worsen his position. The rules
force him to make a move, even if it means that he will lose the game.
56636: . Type REGISTER for additional information.
56848: You'd better hang onto your rule book. You never know when you might
need to consult it.
56910: Your interpreter reports a screen size too small to display this game
properly.

Do you wish to continue anyway (y/N)?
57000: Only Knights can jump in chess. Wait until you're promoted!
