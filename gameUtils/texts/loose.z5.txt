108574: begin to rip as you pull them down, so you stop. No use ruining

108792: That doesn't seem to fit the lock.
108828: You slam the door with all your strength.
108860: Not exactly a quiet, stealthy burglar, are you?
108896: The drawer won't budge past a certain point. One of the desk's many
safety features, no doubt--heavy desk drawers hurt when they land on your foot.
109000: You see the usual collection of junk found in desk drawers across the
land: bent paper clips, brittle rubber bands, pencils with broken leads, pens
that leak profusely and pens that refuse to secrete even the tiniest dribble of
ink, torn scraps of paper, fuzz, used tissues, dust and every other useless
piece of debris imaginable.
109236: It's a simple latch used to lock and unlock the door from the inside.
109284: There's a keyhole in the doorknob.
109312: You peer through the keyhole but can't see anything.

109380: Sharp slivers of glass stick out at all angles.
109416: The panes of glass sparkle in the sunlight.
109512: You smash the window to smithereens, sending shards of glass flying.
For shame! The window can be repaired, but can your mother's broken heart?
109640: Sharp slivers of glass prevent you.
109728: It's already open. Oh, you mean you want to raise the window!
109856: How warm and comfortable it looks inside!
109888: Your mother isn't here to bandage you up, so you decide to leave the
broken glass alone.
109992: as you can, but it proves too awkward to carry. Pieces of it drift
lazily through the air like falling snow, and you eventually abandon the idea.

110228: You can't juggle three bags full and everything else, too.
110272: as you can, but it proves too awkward to carry. Pieces of it drift
lazily through the air like falling snow, and you eventually abandon the idea.
110412: You're seven years old and in trouble a lot. You try to be good and to
do as you ought, but nothing, it seems, goes exactly as planned. For instance,
today things got quite out of hand: you poured your own milk, but it spilled on
the floor; the cat wanted out just as you slammed the door; you didn't remember
to turn off the faucet; your brother, poor thing, is still locked in the
closet.
110690: But that wasn't all. No, indeed. Did I mention that things got much
worse? They did. Pay attention: you're lost and alone and nothing's familiar.
You wander around for a while until you're ready to panic. Then, out of the
blue, an egg on a fence asks for help--and from you!
110908: The back of your hand is bleeding slightly where the kitten scratched
it.
110960: You can't remove your hand from the rest of you!
110996: Leave it alone. It stings, and you don't want to make it any worse.
111046: You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable,
either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like
searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.
111200: "No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you
whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's
glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed
egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."
111414: After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very
rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect
their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg
crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.
111620: The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one
horizon to the other.
111684: Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and
if that egg isn't careful...
111756: The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.
111798: "Leaving so soon?" sighs the egg. "Well, be careful. Dangerous
creatures lurk in the shadows."
111872: "Don't go!" pleads the egg. "The forest is full of loathsome beasts.
You'd be much happier here with me. Really, you would."
111968: Bravely, the egg calls after you: "My life is in your hands! I trust
you will return shortly to rescue me!"
112048: The egg is humming a vaguely familiar tune.
112080: Mmmm...the delicate scent of lavender drifts through the air.
112124: . After a little while, you sit down to rest. The fence and the road
look the same here; nothing has changed, except that now you're completely
alone on a road to nowhere. Discouraged, you stand up and trudge all the way
back to
112300: "Stop that at once!" orders the egg, clutching the fence post for dear
life. "I'll fall and shatter into a million pieces!"
112436: The fence is much too high and unsteady for you to climb.
112476: How on earth did that egg get up there?
112504: The fence creaks ominously as a gust of wind swirls against it. When a
ray of sunlight falls just so, a few of the boards show traces of graffiti.
Someone has tried to scrub away the message, but you can see dribbles of paint
where the spray can was held too close.
112688: "Please be careful," urges the egg. "It's not very stable."
112736: You can't see over the fence. You can't see under it. And you can't see
around it, either.
112804: You lean the ladder against the fence and stand back, not quite sure
what to do next. However, the egg, surprisingly nimble for such an
awkward-looking creature, turns himself around and climbs down rapidly,
obviously accustomed to this sort of rescue service. Once down, he grabs your
hand and shakes it vigorously. "Thank you, thank you so much," the egg exclaims
again and again. "Really, I can't thank you enough."
113104: Finally, his gratitude properly expressed, the egg waddles away,
turning to wave goodbye one last time before he disappears completely. "You
saved my life!" he shouts. "I won't forget you!"
113240: "Do be careful! You'll bump the fence and knock me off!"
113288: The fence is too high to put anything on it; you can't reach the top.
113392: The sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north-south passage winds
through the forest here; trees and gnarled undergrowth barricade all other
exits. Chill air seeps up from the ground and coils around your body, reaching
down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers.
113580: You hear nothing but dead silence.
113604: The woodsy odor of mud and mold, decay and death, hovers in the air.
113652: A tangle of shrubbery, dead branches, and creeping vines prevents you
from wandering off the path.
113724: A branch has fallen from one of the trees and lies across the path.
113772: It's a rather large, dead branch from one of the trees in the forest.
113824: A shiny golden hairpin seems to be caught in it!
113860: No way. You might never get out again. Especially since the well
probably narrows as it gets deeper. And since the branch must lean against the
wall for support, you'll have even less room down at the bottom than you do up
here. All in all, not a good idea.
114040: Climbing a branch not attached to a tree will get you nowhere.
114084: Wet branches slap your face, their icy needles stinging. Dense
underbrush creeps in from all sides. With each step, mud oozes into your shoes.
Insects drop from above and crawl through your hair; knuckles scrape against
rough bark. The path hooks from south to southwest here, slithering between the
trees like a snake. Faint rustling sounds catch your ear, but when you turn to
look, all is still and quiet.
114372: You hear whispery, rustling sounds coming from behind the trees.
114420: You hear nothing. No insects. No birds. No little rustlings of animals.
Nothing. The phrase "dead silence" springs to mind.
114512: Ah, the smell of the outdoors! Mud. Wet leaves. Mold and rot.
114560: At your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever
dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and
are strewn everywhere.
114676: Woven from green and yellow straw, the picnic basket has seen better
days. One corner is dented, and the straw is ripped where a handle was once
attached.
114784: The picnic basket isn't big enough.
114812: The faint odor of pease porridge and straw greets your nostrils.
114856: It has blue forget-me-nots painted around the rim.
114892: , but it slips off when you're not looking. That happens a lot to you.
This time, however, it doesn't make a mess on your mother's freshly cleaned
carpet.
115004: is more than the delicate porcelain dish can bear, and it shatters.
Ever mindful of your mother's repeated warnings about the dangers of broken
glass, you try your best to sweep away the pieces so that no one will get hurt.
115160: An unidentified substance has congealed around the lid, sealing it to
the pot.
115216: Hello? You aren't holding the necessary equipment.
115256: It won't come off the pot. It's stuck.
115288: An iron pot has come to rest at the edge of the footpath, near a tree.
115340: The pot hangs at the bottom of the well, where it's too dark to see
very much.
115396: The pot is deep and flat-bottomed, with a curved handle that crosses
from one side to the other for easy carrying.
115476: Some black yarn is tied to the pot handle.
115508: Although the iron pot has started to rust, you can see where something
has dribbled out from under the lid and run down the sides.
115672: You hear sloshing noises coming from inside the pot.
115708: As good-looking as ever, except for the splotches of pease porridge all
over your clothes.
115772: Well, ok, if you say so. Pease porridge splatters far and wide. Some of
it gets on you.
115836: Leave it alone; it isn't bothering anyone.
115868: You need to be holding the pot to do that.
115900: You have an iron deficiency, perhaps?
115928: You can't do that unless you're holding the pot.
115964: You can't do that unless you're holding the pot.
116000: You pull the pot, which is tied to the bobbin with some yarn, but the
spinning wheel, instead of sliding along smoothly, tips precariously. It's much
too heavy and awkward to pull around like a puppy on a leash.
116148: As you pull the pot (which is tied to the yarn), the yarn unwinds from
the bobbin.
116208: The yarn is tied to the pot and trails after it.
116244: The pot hangs at the bottom of the well, where it's too dark to see
very much.
116300: You can't, because the pot is closed.
116328: You haven't got anything to tie it with.
116360: You're just being silly. Stop it, or I'll tell your mother.
116408: Using the spoon's handle, you break the seal between pot and lid. Ever
so cautiously, you lift the lid and peek into the pot but
116572: The lid and pot are so firmly attached to each other that you must tug
with all your strength to separate them. All at once, without warning, the seal
between them gives way.
116692: The lid flies out of your grasp and rolls out of sight.

Fortunately,
you still have the pot. In it, you see some pease porridge.
116864: The pease porridge in the pot appears to be about nine days old.
116908: It's too thick. You might try eating it instead.
116944: You can't do that unless you're holding the pot.
116980: You could if you had the spoon. But you don't.
117016: Really! Were you born in a barn? You can almost hear your mother's
voice: "Civilised people do not stick their faces in a pot to eat."
117152: Ecchhh! Nasty stuff. You decide to get rid of it before someone gets
sick.
117208: You can't do that unless you're holding the pot.
117244: You empty the pease porridge into the well. In a few moments, you hear
a faraway splash an angry, screeching yowl.
117324: You look around for an inconspicuous spot, and hastily dump the pease
porridge. It soaks into the
117420: But you can't! It will drip all over your nice, clean clothes. If you
want to empty the pot, just say so.
117496: You can't do that unless you're holding the pot.
117532: You could if you had the spoon. But you don't.
117568: You put the spoon into the pot and stir.
117600: Down at the bottom, somewhere in all that thick, goopy mess, the spoon
encounters something that is definitely not pease porridge. You tilt the pot
back and forth, you poke around with the spoon, but you just can't seem to fish
it out, whatever it is.
117776: You can't do that unless you're holding the pot.
117812: Remember that time you refused to eat your peas at dinner and your
mother served them to you again for breakfast? The pease porridge smells just
like that. Nasty.
117924: You can't do that unless you're holding the pot.
117960: You can't throw the pease porridge at yourself.
118060: . It splatters everywhere, but most of it eventually dribbles down and
soaks into the ground. Speechless for once, Mary stares at you with her mouth
open.
118168: . It splatters everywhere, but most of it soaks into the ground.
118216: You hurl the pease porridge at the egg, who gasps in disbelief and
spends the next several minutes trying to wipe pease porridge off himself with
his handkerchief.
118328: Thanks to you, the egg's designer labels now have pease porridge stains
all over them.
118388: The egg's clothes, including his once pristine handkerchief, have been
ruined by the pease porridge you so callously threw at him.
118480: The egg's clothes, including his once rumpled but reasonably clean
handkerchief, have been ruined by the pease porridge you so callously threw at
him.
118584: You hurl the pease porridge at the kitten. Immediately, the kitten
begins to wash itself, and soon all traces of the pease porridge are gone.
118684: You hurl the pease porridge at Mary, who immediately scoops off as much
of it as she can and wipes it onto you, yelling, "Food fight!"
118780: Thanks to you, Mary's hair and clothes are splotched green with pease
porridge.
118836: As good-looking as ever, except for the splotches of pease porridge all
over your clothes.
118900: You hurl the pease porridge at the wolf, who licks it off and smacks
his lips. "Yummy!" he decides, arching one eyebrow in surprise. "Not as tasty
as pork chops or even grandmothers, but it'll do in a pinch."
119052: . It splatters everywhere, but most of it soaks into the
119140: It's a thick soup made from peas. Yum.
119172: It's a shiny golden hairpin.
119196: Thankfully, you don't see any hair on it. Just some specks of pease
porridge.
119252: Just in time, you remember your mother's warnings about putting sharp
objects in your mouth, ears, eyes and nose. Whew. That was close.
119352: Ouch! It's still hot from the fire.
119380: It tastes slightly of pease porridge.
119408: The spoon is slightly bent, as if it has been stepped on.
119448: It's been lying on the ground for several days and looks as though
someone (or something) has stepped on it. You do NOT want to
119540: The footpath snaking down from the northeastern forest has widened here
into a country lane. Gravel crunches beneath your feet and a warm breeze
riffles your hair as you walk in the sun. Some distance to the west, a few
small cottages flock together like children telling secrets. Smoke curls from
the chimney of the cottage nearest to you. Beyond the village, further west, a
clock tower rises above the surrounding roofs.
119832: Blooming with color and fragrance, a tidy garden snuggles against the
stone cottage to the south. Ivy frames the whitewashed front door; starched
white curtains hang in a diamond-paned window. A faint path forks southeast and
southwest around the cottage, toward the back. To the north, across the lane
that runs through the village, a few small cottages line the road. The clock
tower looms further west, silhouetted against the sky.
120134: Gradually, the steady, monotonous hum of machinery drifts into your
consciousness.
120196: The monotonous hum of machinery drills steadily into your ears.
120244: The continuous humming and clacking of the spinning wheel drones on and
on.
120296: You hear the faint hum of machinery accompanied by a noise that
resembles the hypnotic clicking of train wheels on a track.
120380: Oh! Roses and honeysuckle and rich, dark earth and summer breezes. You
close your eyes for a moment, and breathe deeply.
120468: You're not supposed to cross the street by yourself. Memories of the
last time you tried it and got caught prevent you from attempting it now.
120568: Two low hedges, mostly roses twined with jasmine and honeysuckle, flank
the walkway leading to the cottage. Just before the doorway, the hedges part
company, one bearing right, the other left. Freshly cut grass, warmed by the
sun, blankets the rest of the yard. In one corner, almost hidden, a teeny tiny
sign pokes out of the ground.
120804: You breathe in the perfume of roses and new-mown grass.
120844: Ouch! A thorn pricked you. Perhaps you should leave the roses alone.
120896: The vines have worked their way around the entire door frame. One
especially vigorous young shoot reaches for the doorknob.
120984: You inspect the supporting trellis first. Then you grab the thickest
vine you can reach, wrap it around one hand and tug. The trellis pulls away
from the house, convincing you not to risk life and limb in such a foolish
endeavor. Reminds you of the time you climbed out your bedroom window at home
and...well, anyway, it hurt, and your mother yelled and cried and laughed all
at the same time, and made you promise you'd never do that again.
121336: The trellis is not sturdy enough to support the ladder.
121376: The vines are too tightly entwined in the trellis. You can't untangle
them.
121432: You close your eyes and inhale the scent of summer: a mix of roses and
honeysuckle and sun-warmed grass. Mmmm...
121512: With no fences to hinder it, the waist-high grass flows unimpeded for
miles, like water downstream, covering the world from here to the horizon.
Almost hidden by the grass, a narrow path forks northeast and northwest toward
the front of the cottage. A swath to the west lies flat, as if someone waded
through it not long ago. At the far edge of the meadow, against the western
sky, a few cloud feathers drift leisurely behind the clock tower's silhouette.
121828: Oh! Rich, dark earth and summer breezes. You close your eyes for a
moment, breathing deeply.
121896: You can't, since the cottage blocks your way.
121932: Prickly weeds and burrs weave through the grass, creating a tangle
impossible to penetrate any further.
122004: From the scrubbed oak floorboards to the comfy, upholstered furniture
gathered around the hearth, this feels like home.
122156: The high-backed wing chair must be someone's favorite: the cloth is
worn smooth on both arms, and the seat cushion dips unevenly.
122272: Please! You can't lie down in an armchair. It isn't big enough.
122408: , enjoying yourself almost as much as that time she had the flu and
didn't care what you did, as long as you were quiet. After a little while, you
get bored and sit down like a civilized human being to think about what you
might do next.
122572: You find nothing of interest. Not even any dust.
122704: You find nothing of interest. No notes, no keys, no money. Sorry.
122754: A green banker's lamp sits on the desktop.
122856: Your mother put considerable time and effort into teaching you some
basic manners so that she wouldn't have to watch you every minute. Oh, well.
You completely ignore her instructions and
123080: The desk drawers are too small. Or you're too big. Take your pick.
123132: You find nothing. Not even any dust.
123160: . As long as you're snooping, you decide to search the drawers as well.
123214: The desk drawers look perfectly ordinary:
123248: You'll need to say which desk drawer you're talking about.
123292: The floorboards are wide, planked oak, worn smooth.
123332: The furniture is worn, but clean and comfortable. There's an armchair
and sofa in the middle of the room, with a small table between them, and a
scratched wooden desk against the wall behind the couch.
123696: You're already sitting in the armchair.
123724: You're already sitting on the sofa.
123752: down for a moment, imagining how it must feel to live in such snug
comfort, but your nervousness about tresspassing overpowers you. Reluctantly,
you stand up again.
123904: A crackling fire blazes in the fireplace.
123936: The green and yellow basket ignites in a puff of green and yellow
smoke, crackling and snapping fiercely in the flames. It burns until nothing
remains.
124040: With a spectacular display of fireworks, the battery explodes. You're
lucky you weren't killed!
124108: A sudden downdraft blows the hairpin back out into the room, where it
lands on the floor, glowing with heat.
124184: You toss the iron pot at the fire, but it hits the side of the
fireplace and bounces back into the room.
124256: The spoon melts and curls in the heat of the fire until nothing
remains.
124348: Ahh, the pungent odor of incinerated tree stumps assails your nostrils.
124400: It's a banker's lamp--electric and with a green glass shade.
124444: You can't. The lamp's electric cord is jammed between the desk and the
wall.
124500: The newspaper, dated yesterday, screams its headlines:
124576: Authorities admitted today they have no leads in the sudden
disappearance of Mother Loose, missing since late yesterday morning. Although
rumors of kidnapping, ransom, and fowl play have spread like wildfire, official
word remains the same: no evidence exists to confirm or deny such reports.
124782: The newly-appointed Mother Loose is widely known to have been a
controversial choice for this high-ranking government position, leading some to
speculate that a fringe terrorist group may have taken matters into their own
hands. When interviewed last week, Mother Loose strongly pooh-poohed the idea
that her appointment had been politically motivated, saying only that she
intended to keep "my public life public and my private life private, thank you
very much."
125108: In a recent telephone interview, Mr. Humpty Dumpty, who serves as
Mother Loose's immediate supervisor, had no comment on his new employee's
sudden vanishing act. Asked for his interpretation of the day's events, the egg
could only repeat, "Oh, dear, I feel just terrible about this. If anything has
happened to her, I shall never forgive myself."
125360: Last seen walking east through the village at approximately 11 o'clock
yesterday morning, Mother Loose was wearing normal business attire and carrying
a small brown paper sack of unknown origin. Anyone with information regarding
her possible whereabouts is urged to contact authorities immediately.
125576: The faded plaid sofa looks inviting.
125720: , enjoying yourself almost as much as that time she had the flu and
didn't care what you did, as long as you were quiet. After a little while, you
125876: You find nothing of interest. Not even any dust.
125912: You find nothing of interest. No notes, no keys, no money. Sorry.
125964: Just a small wooden table with no particularly outstanding
characteristics.
126084: Your mother put considerable time and effort into teaching you some
basic manners so that she wouldn't have to watch you every minute. Oh, well.
You completely ignore her instructions and
126364: A skein of black yarn is wound around the bobbin; one loose end of the
yarn flaps rhythmically with each rotation of the wheel.
126452: A wooden spinning wheel sits quietly nearby.
126548: The spinning wheel is turning so rapidly that you wonder if the whole
thing will fly apart and hurl pieces of itself through the air. The bobbin, in
particular, looks like a dangerous projectile.
126684: The wooden spinning wheel sits quietly.
126712: What's this? You find a sliding panel and a toggle switch on the
underside of the spinning wheel's frame.
126788: The battery compartment and toggle switch are still there.
126828: The panel and toggle switch are still there.
126860: You can't lift the spinning wheel.
126920: Clickety clack, clackety click, clickety clack.
126956: You can't open the spinning wheel!
126984: Living dangerously, aren't you? A spinning spinning wheel is not a toy.
127036: The pot hanging down the well is heavy, and the yarn is caught on the
edge of the bricks, preventing you from pushing the spinning wheel anywhere.
127168: Living dangerously, aren't you? A spinning spinning wheel is not a toy.
127220: The pot hanging down the well is heavy, and the yarn is caught on the
edge of the bricks, preventing you from pushing the spinning wheel anywhere.
127320: You can't, because the cottage door is closed.
127356: You can't, because the door is closed.
127408: bogs down in the mud and won't budge. You drag it back to the gravel
lane to decide what to do next.
127480: You can't, because the bungalow door is closed.
127514: gets stuck in the grass and won't budge. You'll have to leave it here
if you want to go in that direction.
127592: You can't, because the cottage door is closed.
127626: gets stuck in the grass and won't budge. You'll have to leave it here
if you want to go in that direction.
127704: Living dangerously, aren't you? A spinning spinning wheel is not a toy.
127840: You can't lift the spinning wheel.
127892: The spinning wheel is too heavy and awkward to carry, but you might be
able to push it somewhere.
127960: It's already spinning like crazy. What's your definition of on?
128008: It's already turning as fast as it can go.
128040: The pot is too heavy. You can't budge the wheel.
128076: You turn the spinning wheel by hand.
128148: is heavier than it looks. Taking a deep breath, you shove it forward a
few feet, rest and repeat.
128328: The bobbin is a wooden spindle that collects the finished yarn or
thread as it spins.
128420: The bobbin is spinning even faster than the spinning wheel.
128464: The bobbin and spinning wheel are at rest.
128496: If you stick your hand in there now while that thing is whirling around
like a dervish, you'll lose your fingers.
128576: The bobbin will hold a skein of yarn, and that's all.
128616: If you stick your hand in there now while that thing is whirling around
like a dervish, you'll lose your fingers.
128694: You tie one end of the yarn to the bobbin.
128728: You wind the loose end of the yarn around the bobbin.
128766: You wind the yarn around the bobbin.
128796: Not a chance. If you stick your hand in there now, you'll mangle it
beyond all recognition.
128864: That's permanently attached to the spinning wheel.
128900: You haven't got anything to tie it with.
128932: You're just being silly. Stop it, or I'll tell your mother.
128980: A bobbin is a spindle that holds yarn or thread. On spinning wheels,
the bobbin is usually driven by a pulley attached to the wheel and collects the
finished yarn or thread as it spins.
129108: The battery compartment is a rectangular hole in the wooden frame of
the spinning wheel with two small, protruding metal knobs at one end. When the
sliding panel is closed, you'd never know the cavity exists, except for a thin,
dark outline of its shape. The compartment currently
129304: Are you trying to electrocute yourself?
129332: That's permanently attached to the spinning wheel.
129368: Remembering your mother's warnings about the dangers of electricity,
you flip the toggle switch to the OFF position first, just in case. Then you
129508: The battery is black and red and heavy, with two snap fasteners at one
end to hold it firmly in place inside the compartment.
129596: Remembering your mother's warnings about the dangers of electricity,
you flip the toggle switch to the OFF position first, just in case. The
spinning wheel slows to a stop.
129720: Carefully, you lift the battery from its compartment.
129760: The panel is made from the same wood as the spinning wheel and is flush
with the frame. It's
129904: That's permanently attached to the spinning wheel.
129980: That's permanently attached to the spinning wheel.
130016: Straining to pull its heavy load up from the bottom of the well, the
spinning wheel creaks and groans with each rotation. You peer down into the
darkness. There! What was that? Something moved! Something has hitched a ride
in the pot!
130184: All of a sudden, you notice the yarn rubbing on the well's edge,
fraying dangerously. You try to pull the yarn away from the sharp bricks, but
it's too taut; there's no slack. After several tense minutes, the pot finally
arrives at the top, and two wide green eyes peek out over the side. Just then,
the frayed yarn breaks.
130416: A tiny gray and white kitten leaps for its life as the pot clatters
back down the shaft. Front claws gripping the rim, back claws scrabbling
furiously against the inside bricks, the kitten at last manages to pull itself
up to the safety of the ledge. It sneezes twice in the bright sunshine before
jumping into the grass at your feet.
130648: The spinning wheel, freed from the weight of the pot, begins to shake
as it picks up speed. You reach over and flip the toggle switch off before the
whole thing rattles itself to pieces. Purring, the kitten licks one paw and
washes its face.
130816: Slowly, the wheel begins to turn, creaking under the weight of the iron
pot. The winding yarn drags the pot
130926: When the bobbin can't turn any further, you flip the toggle switch off
again.
130984: The treadle begins to pump, slowly at first, then picking up speed.
Soon the wheel is spinning frantically.
131060: You flip the toggle switch to the ON position.
131096: You flip the toggle switch to the OFF position, and the spinning wheel
slows to a stop.
131160: You flip the toggle switch to the OFF position.
131196: That's permanently attached to the spinning wheel.
131232: A treadle is a flat lever that, when pressed repeatedly by the foot,
makes the wheel turn.
131308: You're already in trouble; one more misdeed won't make any difference.
You pick up
131396: The soft black wool is thick and cushiony.
131440: Your mother won't be happy about this. When the time comes--and it WILL
come, you're certain--you'll just have to talk fast and hope for the best.
131548: The glossy black wool is airy and buoyant.
131600: You'll have some explaining to do to your mother, won't you? Well, it
won't be the first time.
131672: The curly black wool is springy and resilient.
131708: The black yarn seems very strong, almost like rope.
131748: One loose end flaps rhythmically around the bobbin as the spinning
wheel turns.
131836: One end of the yarn is tied to the pot handle.
131868: You need to be holding the yarn before you can tie it.
131908: You dare not put your fingers anywhere near the bobbin while it's
spinning.
131960: You'll have to untie the pot and remove the yarn from the bobbin first.
132012: You'll have to remove the yarn from the bobbin first.
132052: You'll have to untie the pot first.
132080: The pot didn't feel this heavy before!
132108: The pot must be filled with water, because it didn't feel this heavy
before!
132164: You can't lift it, and the yarn is pulled so tightly against the bricks
that you can't get any slack at all.
132240: The yarn is tied to the pot handle, so pulling it drags the pot around
like a puppy on a leash.
132308: You pull on the yarn, which is tied to the bobbin, but instead of
sliding along smoothly, the spinning wheel tips precariously. It's much too
heavy and awkward to pull around like a puppy on a leash.
132448: Putting things on the yarn would achieve nothing.
132484: You dare not put your fingers anywhere near the bobbin while it's
spinning.
132536: . As you untie it, the yarn slips off the bobbin, too
132576: . You are now holding the pot and the yarn.
132608: The yarn isn't tied to the bobbin.
132636: You look around, half expecting to see your mother. She's not here, so
you carefully slide the skein of black yarn off the bobbin, taking care that it
doesn't unwind all over the floor.
132816: . The pot is tied to the other end of the yarn.
132852: The pot is at the bottom of the well. You can't reach it from here.
132900: . You'll need to untie the yarn before you can throw it at anything.
132948: You'll need to remove the yarn from the bobbin first.
132988: The yarn is already tied to the bobbin and the pot handle.
133028: You need to be holding the yarn before you can tie it to anything.
133076: You dare not put your fingers anywhere near the bobbin while it's
spinning.
133128: The handle is gone, so you tie the yarn to a loose piece of straw and
give it a tug. The yarn slips off. Then you try to poke the yarn through an
undamaged part of the basket's weave, but the straw is so tightly woven that
you can't find a gap big enough.
133306: You tie the loose end of the yarn to the bobbin.
133344: You tie one end of the yarn to the bobbin.
133376: The yarn is already tied to the bobbin.
133404: No...no, that doesn't seem to work very well.
133440: The yarn is already tied to the pot.
133468: You tie one end of the yarn to the pot handle.
133500: You tie the loose end of the yarn to the pot handle.
133536: You'll have to untie the yarn from the pot first.
133572: You'll have to remove the yarn from the bobbin first.
133680: until you return to your starting point. Then you tie a nice, big bow
with the yarn. When you realize you didn't accomplish anything even remotely
useful, you untie the yarn and contemplate life's mysteries for awhile.
133832: The wolf snarls at you. "I ain't no dog. Get that leash away from me."
133888: You tie the yarn into a pretty bow and then untie it again. You have an
uneasy feeling that you are wasting precious time.
133972: The pot and the yarn drop to the bottom of the well, lost forever.
134020: The cottage is modest and charming, a perfect portrait of rustic
country living.
134076: You can't. The door is shut and the curtains are closed.
134120: How warm and comfortable it looks inside!
134152: What a beautiful view of the front garden!
134184: The curtains are made from white eyelet lace and have ruffles at the
bottom.
134236: is shut. Its brass doorknob resembles the head of a lion.
134308: The ladder is too big and awkward to carry through the door.
134352: The ladder is too big and awkward to carry through the door.
134396: The cottage door is already unlocked. If you want to lock it, you don't
need the hairpin
134460: . Just open the door and lock it.
134556: and jiggle it in the lock. Nothing happens. You twist and poke and jab
and prod, until finally something clicks into place. Aha! You remove the
hairpin, turn the knob ever so gently, and ease the cottage door open.

You're
quite pleased with yourself, aren't you? Your mother, on the other hand, would
be ashamed of you.
134788: My, you certainly have a way with hairpins, don't you?
134828: No lion's head here. Just a simple latch used to lock and unlock the
door from the inside.
134892: The brass doorknob is cast in the shape of a lion's head, mouth
stretched wide--to roar? Or to yawn in sleepy boredom? Looking closer, you see
a keyhole deep within the lion's throat.
135022: A cheery pink bungalow with gingerbread trim and a yellow painted door
nestles behind the picket fence to the south. Grass covers the yard from corner
to corner, except at the edges, where flowers dance with the fence. Circling
the bungalow to the southeast and southwest, a faint path leads around the
back. To the north, a few small homes peer across the lane, which has narrowed,
but still runs east to west at this end of the village. The clock tower
dominates the skyline to the west.
135362: A white rectangle in the middle of the bright yellow door catches your
eye.
135418: A placard is thumbtacked to the bungalow door.
135454: Mary follows you around the corner of the house.
135492: Mary skips beside you to the back of the bungalow.
135528: Mary runs ahead, yelling "Come on, hurry up!"
135564: "Bye!" Mary waves. "See you later!"
135596: "Baa." The baby lamb talks to the butterflies.
135632: Oh! Roses and honeysuckle and rich, dark earth and summer breezes. You
close your eyes for a moment, and breathe deeply.
135718: Mary skips round a corner of the house and waves to you.
135760: You're not supposed to cross the street by yourself. Memories of the
last time you tried it (and got caught) prevent you from attempting it now.
135864: A white picket fence outlines the bungalow's garden, except for a small
gap where the gate used to be.
135936: The picket fence is small enough to step over, but since the gate is
missing, you walk through the gap instead.
136016: Except for the multitude of flowers edging the fence, grass--and
nothing but grass--blankets the yard.
136092: You close your eyes for a moment and inhale. Roses. Jasmine.
Honeysuckle. And grass.
136156: No. Please try to behave yourself, if only for your mother's sake.
136204: If this fence ever had a gate, it's long gone.
136240: You step through the gap in the fence.
136268: The fence post on one side of the gap shows very faint markings of
holes made by hinges, but these have been carefully patched and painted.
136364: You step through the gap in the fence.
136392: You step through the gap in the fence.
136420: Elaborate scrollwork decorates the bungalow's door and window frames,
the eaves, and other ornamental wood trim.
136500: "Who's there?" a voice inquires from inside the bungalow.
136544: "Who's there?" Mary recognizes her cue.
136576: Grass surrounds you, acres of it, spreading across the countryside as
far as you can see. A ribbon of flattened grass curves eastward, and another,
not quite as fresh, circles the bungalow, branching northeast and northwest. A
grass-covered hill to the southwest shimmers under the sun's heat; waves of
green-gold grass ripple toward the crest of the hill, racing the wind to the
top.
136846: Mary follows you to the front of the house.
136880: Mary skips beside you to the front of the bungalow.
136918: Mary runs ahead, yelling "Come on, hurry up!"
136956: "Bye!" Mary waves. "See you later!"
136988: "Hi there," Mary waves. "Nice to see you again."
137028: You can't, since the bungalow blocks your way.
137064: Prickly weeds and burrs weave through the grass, creating a tangle
impossible to penetrate any further.
137136: A wooden ladder lies half-hidden in the grass next to the bungalow.
137184: It's a perfectly normal wooden ladder: two parallel slats connected by
twenty or so wooden rungs inserted at regular intervals about nine or ten
inches apart. The rungs do seem a little close together, but perhaps that's
because this ladder was made especially for short people. After all, who would
be more likely to use a ladder?
137412: "Hey! Get away from there!" snaps a voice from the bungalow. Alarmed,
you jump back.
137476: "Don't touch that; it's not yours!" You jerk your hand back guiltily.
Who said that? It seemed to come from the direction of the bungalow.
137580: "Stop, thief!" You whirl around, seeking your accuser.
137624: "Leave that ladder alone, or I'll tell your mother!" orders a voice
from inside the bungalow.
137692: "I'll let you borrow the ladder if you'll give me that hairpin," Mary
bargains. "I'm positive it's the one my friend lost last week, and I'd like to
give it back to her. Deal?"
137824: "I've changed my mind," Mary says frostily. "I'm mad at you. Ask me
again later when I'm in a better mood."
137908: "You shouldn't touch things that don't belong to you," Mary remarks.
137960: You climb up the ladder until your eyes are level with the roof. But
the ladder wobbles and you feel a little woozy when you look at the ground, so
you quickly climb back down again.
138088: The fence is too rickety to support the ladder while you climb it. How
the egg managed to get down without bringing the whole kit and caboodle
crashing to the ground is a wonder.
138212: You climb up the ladder, but the ground is damp and unstable, the
ladder wobbles and you feel a little woozy when you look at the ground, so you
quickly climb back down again.
138332: You can't climb the ladder unless it's leaning against something sturdy
enough to support it.
138400: "I've changed my mind," Mary declares frostily. "I'm mad at you. Ask me
again later when I'm in a better mood."
138488: Even though it's heavy and awkward, the ladder is still easier to carry
than to push.
138548: There's no good place to put a ladder.
138576: "Thank you very much for returning my ladder," Mary says, laying it on
the ground.
138638: "Do you mind?" asks Mary, removing the ladder and laying it on the
ground.
138724: The trellis isn't sturdy enough to support the ladder.
138764: , but the angle is too shallow. The ladder slips down and lies flat on
the
138816: That's not a good place to put a ladder.
138848: "I've changed my mind," Mary declares frostily. "I'm mad at you. Ask me
again later when I'm in a better mood."
138936: The ladder is too heavy and awkward to carry while you're holding
anything else.
138992: What a mess! You catch only a glimpse but, in that brief moment, you
behold clothes scattered across the floor, draped over the furniture and
spilling from half-open drawers. Sprinkled among the clothes, like confetti
over a parade route, are toys and papers and crayons and hair ornaments and
books and shoes and...
139216: Mary rushes in behind you and steers you quickly back outside. "My mom
said I can't entertain any friends in here unless I clean up this mess, and she
means it this time, I can tell, so we'd better get out of here before I'm
grounded for the rest of my natural born days." Breathless, she slams the door
shut and leans her back against it.
139456: Mary squeezes herself between you and the doorway, forcing you to step
back outside. She shuts the door and confesses, "My mom says I can't go
anywhere until I clean up my mess. I guess that makes me a prisoner for life."
139616: The pink bungalow sits at the edge of a vast field of grass.
139660: You can't. The door is shut and the curtains are closed.
139704: How warm and comfortable it looks inside!
139736: What a beautiful view of the front garden!
139816: The ladder is too big and awkward to carry through the door.
139860: The ladder is too big and awkward to carry through the door.
139940: "Please don't go in there," Mary insists, grabbing the doorknob.
139988: Mary frowns. "You can't go in until I clean it up," she explains.
140040: "My mom said nobody's allowed inside until she can see the floor," Mary
apologizes.
140100: "Stop that! What's the matter with you, anyway?" Mary shouts. "Go break
your own window and leave mine alone!"
140218: The placard is hand lettered on sturdy white posterboard. It reads:
140328: Stop that. You're in enough trouble as it is.
140364: The placard smells of cardboard and felt-tipped markers.
140404: The tack is shoved all the way through the placard into the wood of the
door. Only its round head, once shiny but now tarnished, is visible.
140504: "Just what do you think you're doing?" Mary demands. "Leave that alone
or I'll tell your mother."
140594: You manage to get your fingernail under the thumbtack's head and wiggle
it loose until, all at once, the thumbtack pops free and sails into the grass.
The placard slides to the bottom of the door. 

What has gotten into you? Your
mother will never allow you out of her sight again if you continue this
behavior. Ah, but you remind yourself: your mother will never know. Will she?
140864: The thumbtack is pushed in as far as it will go.
140898: The lane ends its westward progress at the schoolhouse door. At the
southern end of the school, a magnificent stone steeple towers above the
village roofs. To see the clock from where you now stand, you must tilt your
head back and point your chin at the sky. To the southeast, a gentle slope
leads to a hilltop covered with wild grass.
141164: Chairs and more chairs, one behind each student's desk.
141204: Please! You can't lie down in a chair. It isn't big enough.
141252: You sit down at one of the student desks. It's a little cramped, but
not too bad.
141400: , enjoying yourself almost as much as that time she had the flu and
didn't care what you did, as long as you were quiet. After a little while, you
get bored and sit down like a civilized human being to think about what you
might do next.
141564: All the chairs are bolted to the desks, which are bolted to the floor.
They aren't going anywhere.
141652: Your mother put considerable time and effort into teaching you some
basic manners so that she wouldn't have to watch you every minute. Oh, well.
You completely ignore her instructions and
141876: There's no chair to sit in at the teacher's desk.
141912: The desk drawers are too small. Or you're too big. Take your pick.
141964: You find nothing but dust. Then you sneeze, and the dust scatters in
every direction.
142024: The desk drawers look perfectly ordinary:
142056: You'll need to say which desk drawer you're talking about.
142100: The student desks are more like tables than desks. A shelf under the
writing surface of each desk can hold small items.
142208: They're all empty. Every last one of them.
142240: The chalk marks have all but faded from the ground. No one has played
here for a very long time.
142308: Both the playground and its adjacent schoolhouse to the south lie
vacant and deserted. The bare, hard-packed rectangle of earth, despite a few
faint chalk marks, shows no evidence that children may have once played
here--or might ever play here again.
142484: The abandoned schoolroom lacks not only pupils, but also books and
pencils and chalk and paper and any other hint that someone might show up for
school tomorrow. Or the next day. Or the next. Rows of empty desks and chairs
face the teacher's desk at the front of the room as if waiting expectantly for
the day's lesson. The door to the north leads back out to the empty schoolyard.
Stairs to the south lead up into darkness.
142780: The ladder is too big and awkward to carry up the stairs.
142820: The schoolhouse door is solid oak. It's
142852: Sharp slivers of glass prevent you.
142880: Peering through the window, you can see a large desk at the head of the
room, several ragged columns of smaller desks, a circle of chairs in one
corner, and a chalkboard on the wall.
143008: You can see the schoolyard outside.
143036: Dimly lit stairs lead up toward darkness and down into the schoolroom
below. Each step sings a different tune for you: one groans mournfully the
instant you put your weight on it; the next squeaks in protest just as you step
off. At the top of the stairs
143212: Dimly lit stairs lead back down into the schoolroom. Before you
143256: Someone...or something...is pounding on the door.
143296: Loud clicks and whirring noises are coming from inside the room to the
south.
143352: Faintly, through the closed door, you hear something ticking.
143396: The corner of the landing is dark and dusty.
143428: It's pretty dark in here, so you can't see much, but the stairs look
reasonably normal to you. They go up and down. Well, actually, the stairs don't
go up and down. You do. But the stairs help.
143568: Dim, greenish light from above reflects off an assortment of large
brass gears mounted flat against a stone wall on the far side of the room. Taut
cables run upward through a network of pulleys, vanishing into the gloom more
than twenty feet above your head. The entire mechanism turns and meshes in a
slow, rhythmic, hypnotic clockwork dance.
143804: "Not until we've had a little talk," your mother replies. She folds her
arms and taps her foot and, as you watch, seems to grow several feet taller.
143912: "Yes, let's go home," agrees your mother, taking your hand. "We can
tell each other all about our adventures on the way."
144004: "Not so fast, dear. Aren't you forgetting something?"
144048: "Good idea," sighs your mother, looking around the room. "Let's go
home."
144104: The shadowy figure moves to intercept you.
144160: Sinewy cables as thick as your thumb disappear overhead after running
through pulleys fastened with huge iron bolts to the walls and floor.
144256: You try to climb the cables, but grease and rust have made them
slippery, and you slide back down to the floor.
144336: The cables are too taut. They don't budge an inch.
144376: The heavy brass gears, now tarnished with age, vary in size: the
smallest would allow you to spread-eagle yourself across its surface, hands and
feet at opposite edges; the largest spans three times that diameter.
144552: blocks your way. Pale yellow light shines through a narrow crack at the
bottom, like butter melting on the dark floor.
144636: You hear an answering knock, faster and more urgent than your own.
144684: Why would you peek under an open door? Just go in.
144796: Putting things under an open door is a waste of time. Just go in and
carry
144872: You try picking the lock with the hairpin, but you just can't get it to
work.
144928: The tarnished brass key has a long shaft notched at one end with a
single row of teeth. The other end is an open loop of metal designed to fit one
of those old-fashioned circular key rings.
145060: Way back in a dark, dusty corner of the landing, you find a tarnished
brass key.
145116: Why would you peek under an open door? Just go in.
145152: Putting things under an open door is a waste of time. Just go in and
carry
145204: Grass sweeps up the hill like a brushfire, growing taller and thicker
as it approaches the top where you brace yourself against the wind. You can see
everything from up here: the forest, the village, even the fence where you
first met the egg. The schoolhouse and its clock tower lie to the northwest.
145416: Something is scratching and howling at the bottom of the well.
145460: The thick, tall grass rustles as the wind blows through it.
145504: You're too far away to make out any details, but the fence still seems
to stretch from one horizon to the other.
145584: The forest's treetops dance in the sunlight, denying the gloom that
lies beneath.
145644: The schoolhouse sits at the west end of the lane that runs through the
village.
145700: A crumbling brick well sits at the very top of the hill, almost hidden
in a nest of grass. It's the simplest of designs--no cute roof, no crank, no
rope or bucket--just a simple, brick cylinder in the ground. The cover, if it
ever had one, is gone.
145880: From deep within the well's depths, you hear faint scratching noises
interspersed with pathetic mewing.
145952: You can see a ladder in the well.
145980: Good thing you had the foresight to tie the yarn to the bobbin.
146024: Uh, oh. The yarn was wound around the bobbin but it wasn't tied. Big
mistake.
146084: Good thing you had the foresight to tie the yarn to the bobbin.
146128: Good thing you had the foresight to tie the yarn to the bobbin.
146172: Uh, oh. The yarn was wound around the bobbin but it wasn't tied. Big
mistake.
146232: Good thing you had the foresight to tie the yarn to the bobbin.
146276: You sling one leg over the ledge before you remember several television
news reports in which children fell into wells and had to be rescued by the
fire department. Maybe it's not such a good idea after all.
146500: Inside the well you can also see a branch and a ladder just within your
reach.
146556: Inside the well you can see a branch just within your reach.
146600: Inside the well you can see a ladder just within your reach.
146644: You can almost see the pot dangling at the end of the yarn, way down at
the bottom of the well.
146712: the well but accidentally bump into it when you turn around. The ladder
slides onto the ground.
146808: You set the pot on the edge of the brick well, but your elbow
accidentally bumps it when you turn around, sending the pot straight to the
bottom of the abyss.
146920: Luckily, you had the foresight to tie the yarn to the bobbin as well as
to the pot; otherwise, both pot and yarn now would lie at the bottom of the
well. In a few moments, you hear a faraway splash and an anxious screech. The
yarn swings back and forth like a pendulum.
147128: The yarn tied to the pot whips back and forth as the pot ricochets off
the sides of the brick well. You try to grab the yarn before it follows the pot
into the great unknown, but you can't catch it
147264: . The yarn unwinds from the bobbin in the blink of an eye and is gone.
147316: Both the pot and the yarn plummet to the bottom of the well.
147380: You set the pot on the edge of the brick well, but your elbow
accidentally bumps it when you turn around, sending the pot straight to the
bottom of the abyss. In a few moments, you hear a faraway splash
147520: The spinning wheel is too big to fit in the well.
147556: You'll have to untie the pot or remove the yarn from the bobbin first.
147608: again. Luckily, the yarn is tied to the pot, so it doesn't go very far.
147660: Luckily, the yarn is wound around the bobbin, so it doesn't go very
far.
147840: You lean far over the well's edge, peering down into darkness.
147888: Suddenly, a shadow at the bottom leaps up and scrabbles frantically at
the brick sides, howling wretchedly and sending chills up your spine.
147988: In the well you can also see a branch and a ladder just within your
reach.
148040: In the well you can see branch just within your reach.
148080: In the well you can see a ladder just within your reach.
148120: You can almost see the pot dangling at the end of the yarn, way down at
the bottom of the well.
148188: into the well. It drops a few feet and hits bottom, but you can still
reach in and touch it.
148256: A sudden gust of wind carries the shiny golden hairpin away from the
well and drops it on the grass nearby.
148352: You drop the shiny golden hairpin down the well, but you never hear it
hit bottom.
148412: You lower the pot into the well, letting the yarn slide through your
fingers.
148468: In a few moments, you hear a faraway splash and an anxious meow. Then
you feel a tug, and the yarn swings in your hands. The pot feels heavier now.
148572: In a few moments, you hear a faraway splash.
148708: Both the pot and the yarn fall to the bottom of the well.
148768: You lean over the edge of the crumbling well and drop the pot into the
abyss. It ricochets off the brick sides, clattering noisily as it falls. In a
few moments, you hear a faraway splash
149028: Whatever it is crouches at the bottom of a deep, dark well, out of
reach and mostly out of sight. You try to remember everything you know about
monsters that hide in dark places. Don't trolls live in wells? Maybe. Do they
eat children? You can't remember, but you suppose they do. Suddenly, as you
peer down into the murky depths, two glowing green eyes reflect back up at you!
149296: The shadow at the bottom of the well meows pitifully.
149336: Butterflies flicker over the grass, landing briefly now and then,
opening their wings ito catch the sun's warmth.
149416: These butterflies seem to have learned something from the common
housefly: you can't catch them. No matter how carefully you make your moves,
they escape and fly away, landing just out of reach.
149552: At the far west end of the lane, a massive square stone tower juts into
the sky, overlooking the entire village. Near its top, a circular clockface
announces the time. Currently, the little hand, which isn't so little, being at
least as tall as you, points to the one, while the big hand points to the
twelve: it's one o'clock.
149784: The clock must be broken; its hands haven't moved since you last looked
at it. The little hand still points to one, and the big hand still points to
twelve.
149896: It's a clock tower, not a wristwatch. You can't take it, silly.
149944: The cottage lies sleeping in the sun. Other than the smoke drifting
lazily from its chimney, you see no signs of life.
150028: Among the tangled jumble of flowers rioting in the garden, you
recognize only the roses and jasmine and honeysuckle, although at least a dozen
other varieties contend for the same plot of earth, air and water.
150172: Roses. Jasmine. Possibly gardenia. Honeysuckle too.
150212: Ouch! A thorn pricked you. Perhaps you should leave the flowers alone.
150264: Leaves and flowers quiver violently, but nothing else happens.
150308: Crawling with insects, a living mesh of plant life and death
accompanies the path through the forest. Anything not already black with decay
shows signs of having been gnawed.
150428: The lawn is lush and thick and emerald green, and has been neatly
trimmed and mowed recently. Someone takes very good care of this yard.
150524: It tastes just like the grass back home.
150552: You can't. The grass has been cut too short.
150588: It smells like summer and earth and life.
150620: It's a narrow band of flattened grass, created when someone (or
something) waded through it recently.
150692: Thousands, if not millions, of pea-sized stones create a lane that runs
east and west through the village.
150768: You grab a handful of stones, but the sun's heat has made them too hot
to handle. You drop them again in a hurry.
150848: It's an easy slope, covered with rippling green-gold grass and warmed
by the sun.
150908: The ladybug would barely cover your little fingernail. Each red wing
has one black spot on it.
150976: The ladybug spreads her wings and buzzes over to a blade of grass just
out of your reach.
151040: Mary glares at you. "I'm playing with the ladybug right now," she
explains. "Wait your turn."
151112: No fences. No trees. No carefully landscaped gardens. No indication
where one property ends and another begins. Just grass and lots of it. Grass to
roll in on a hot summer's day. Grass to pull up by handfuls and fling into the
air. Grass to wade through on foggy mornings, trampling intricate designs with
your feet. Just grass. That's all.
151356: It tastes just like the grass in your backyard at home.
151396: A breeze rustles through the grass.
151424: You pull up a handful of grass and throw it into the air. Whee!
151472: It smells like summer and earth and life.
151504: The trail is slightly muddy from a recent rain.
151540: You try to grab a handful of mud, but it oozes through your fingers and
dribbles down your arm instead.
151672: "Leaf the gardening to us"
151700: Suddenly, an itsy-bitsy spider scurries across the sign and into the
bushes.
151756: Apparently you're not the only person who has a penchant for landscape
maintenance signs, because this one is cemented into the ground. Permanently.
151860: Dappled sunlight plays on the fence.
151888: Sunlight and shadow chase each other across the landscape.
151928: From somewhere high above your head, a shaft of sunlight filters
through the gloom. Specks of dust swirl in its warmth, but the light is diffuse
and hazy, leaving most of the room in shadows.
152060: You amble over to the edge of the path to take a closer look at the
trees, but it's dark in there and smells like mildew and damp leaves. Any
branch that might hold your weight is too high to reach. Quickly, you scurry
back before something grabs you and doesn't let go.
152248: You're too far away to see very much.
152276: The lower branches won't hold your weight, and you can't reach the
higher limbs. Climbing is impossible.
152352: The trees are over there. You are over here.
152384: No way. Trust me, it's not healthy.
152412: You pull and pull, but the branches stay stuck to the trees.
152456: The village lies sleeping in the sun. Other than the smoke drifting
lazily from a chimney here or there, you see no signs of life.
152548: An impentrable barrier of tangled grass and weeds blocks your way, full
of prickly burrs and stickers designed to work their sharp points into your
clothing and skin as deeply as possible. Not only do the weeds scratch and poke
you unmercifully, but they also release a toxin that causes unbearable itching
on contact.
152764: No, thanks. Your arms and legs have already experienced the distinctly
unpleasant sensations created by this hostile flora; you have no desire to
subject the rest of your body to its attack as well.
152904: Ouch! You try to push the weeds to one side so that you can pass, but
they're full of prickly, pokey burrs that itch like mad. You'll have to find a
different route.
153024: Ouch! You try to grab a handful of weeds, but they're full of prickly,
pokey burrs, and you let go.
153096: The egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime.
153140: The egg flicks an invisible piece of lint off his shirt.
153180: The egg removes a handkerchief from his pocket and polishes a pair of
spectacles.
153356: embroidered on the collar. His necktie is conservative, his shoes
polished,
153516: The egg wobbles ever so slightly on the narrow ledge of the fence.
153580: Flexible you may be, but you can't kick that high. Besides, your mother
would ground you for a week for fighting.
153660: "Stop that! Stop it this minute!" the egg commands, clutching the fence
post for dear life. "If you don't stop, I'll...I'll... Stop it at once, I say!"
153780: "No, no, no!" screams the egg in terror, clutching the fence post for
dear life. "I'll fall and smash into a million pieces! Release me at once!"
Startled, you let go.
153904: "Cease and desist immediately!" threatens the egg, "or I shall inform
your mother."
153968: "Ahem! Kindly keep your hands to yourself!" cautions the egg.
154016: Mmmm...the delicate scent of lavender drifts through the air.
154076: The egg gazes at you in stunned disbelief. "I am deeply hurt and
offended by your obvious lack of empathy for someone in my position," he
laments, kicking you in the ear just hard enough to make you stop. "If you ever
do that again, I shall inform your mother immediately."
154270: "Not if you can't get down from that fence, you won't," jeers the wolf.
154328: "Are you trying to kill me?" demands the egg as he dodges
154372: The egg is still miffed and pays no attention to you.
154412: The egg sits a little straighter and announces proudly, "Humpty Dumpty
at your service!"
154476: "Humpty Dumpty here. I'm honored to make your acquaintance." The egg
leans down to shake your hand.
154552: "Excuse me?" asks the egg uncertainly.
154584: "Pardon me," apologizes the egg. "I must have forgotten the question."
154640: "You needn't answer rhetorical questions, you know," the egg instructs.
"Actually, you needn't answer any questions at all, really, although that might
be construed as less than courteous."
154776: "Come back when you're certain," the egg suggests.
154816: "You're very welcome," replies the egg graciously, "although I can't
imagine why."
154880: "Whatever are you talking about?" the egg grumbles.
154920: "I haven't the slightest idea what you're referring to," murmurs the
egg.
154976: "Perhaps you would care to rephrase that," the egg suggests. "I'm not
quite certain what you intended to say."
155056: The egg is still miffed and pays no attention to you.
155096: "I am not presently wearing a belt, thank you very much," the egg
informs you coldly.
155160: "That old thing? It hasn't worked in ages. In fact, we were hoping
Mother Loose would attend to its repair as one of her first tasks."
155260: "Excuse me?" asks the egg uncertainly.
155292: "You might try going north," offers the egg courteously.
155336: The egg squirms a little before replying, "I'm somewhat embarrassed by
my current inability to get down from here. Perhaps you could provide some
assistance?"
155448: "Never was one to brag much," the egg says modestly.
155488: "Not a lot to tell, really," demurs the egg.
155524: With an embarrassed laugh, the egg admits, "Unfortunately, I've gotten
myself into a spot of trouble. I am unable to descend from this fence without
risking major injury."
155648: "Do take care," warns the egg. "It's very dark in there, and all the
king's horses and men--pardon me, I meant troops--can't patrol it as often as
they should. Decent lighting and video cameras would help, of course, but
budgets are tight these days."
155832: "I'm afraid I must plead ignorance," the egg apologizes.
155876: "Do forgive me," laughs the egg, self-consciously. "I didn't mean to
imply that women are not every bit as capable as men."
155968: "If past experience is any indicator, I should not rely on the king's
horses nor his men--pardon me, I meant troops--for assistance," states the egg
matter-of-factly.
156092: "My heartfelt sympathies to the poor creature," commiserates the egg.
"I know just how it feels."
156164: "Aaaaaahhhh CHOO!" sneezes the egg into his handkerchief. "I'm allergic
to cats," he explains, nose twitching, eyes watering. "Oh, dear me.
Aaaaaahhhhh...CHOO! Pardon me."
156300: "Perhaps we might concentrate on solving my problem now?" sniffs the
egg irritably.
156360: "We have an expert right here," says the egg, nodding at the wolf.
156412: "The wolf fancies himself an expert in that subject area," explains the
egg. "You might try asking him."
156488: "Oh, my, yes!" applauds the egg. "Splendid idea!"
156528: "She's quite nice, as children go," concedes the egg. "Just don't get
her started on knock knock jokes, or you'll never get another word into the
conversation."
156644: The egg looks shocked. "How could I possibly know anything at all about
you? We've never been properly introduced!"
156728: The egg nods politely. "Very nice to meet you, I'm sure. Humpty Dumpty
here, at your service." The egg reconsiders. "Well, actually, I suppose I can't
be of service to anyone until I get off this fence. But, as soon as I do, I
will most certainly be at your service."
156928: Scandalized, the egg replies "But we've only just met! I wouldn't dare
presume such familiarity."
157000: "May she rest in peace," the egg says reverently.
157036: The egg scrutinizes you over the top of his spectacles. "You must be
new in town; I thought everyone had heard: Mother Loose has disappeared! A most
unfortunate incident." He glances furtively all around before motioning you to
step closer. "The circumstances were quite baffling; one can't help but
speculate. Can you keep a secret?"
157280: "I have not yet determined whether to confide in you," the egg says
reproachfully, drumming his fingers on the fence. "Your previous response to my
request for confidentiality did not reassure me." After a suitable delay, the
egg relents enough to grumble, "Oh, all right. Let's try it again, shall we?
Can you keep a secret?
157574: ! Don't breathe a word. She's been kidnapped by terrorists. The
authorities want to avoid a panic, of course, but rumors are flying."
157672: "The police have investigated every preposterous theory from alien
abduction to the Second Coming but are strangely silent on the subject of
international terrorism." The egg sneaks a quick look over his shoulder.
"Obviously, they don't wish to alert the perpetrators."
157864: "My own attempts to locate her have failed miserably. I thought perhaps
I might observe something useful from this vantage point, but I've had no
success." The egg gazes at you hopefully. "Maybe you could--no, no, not likely,
is it?" He sighs. "If the police can't find her, how could you?"
158080: Suddenly, the egg blurts out, "It's all my fault!" Pounding his fist on
a nearby fence post, he vows, "If any harm comes to her, if even one hair on
her head is touched, I shall never, ever forgive myself! Never!"
158236: "Why do you keep asking me about it? I don't know!" Clearly agitated,
the egg mops his forehead with the handkerchief. "She's gone, and no one can
find her! That's all I know! That's all anyone knows!"
158388: "I...I..." The egg takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. "I
didn't mean to lose my temper; please pardon the outburst. It's just that,
well, as you can imagine, we're all terribly worried."
158536: "I'm too upset to talk about it any more," broods the egg. "If only I
could get down from this fence! I feel utterly useless!"
158632: The egg scowls at you over his glasses. "I've told you everything I
know about it. Your interest at this point borders on morbid, so if you've
nothing further to contribute, I'd appreciate a little help with my most
immediate concern: getting down off this fence. If you don't mind."
158836: "Don't just stand there! Do something!" shouts the egg.
158880: "A nightmare," shudders the egg. "All those microphones shoved in my
face as if I knew something they didn't. But what could I tell them? Nothing,
but did that matter? No, it did not."
159016: "Ahem. Yes, well...I'd rather not wear them just now," the egg
stammers, flushing almost imperceptibly. "I'm...well, if you must know, I'm
afraid of heights. I'd rather not see terribly clearly just at the moment."
159180: "I'm ashamed to admit that it did cross my mind," the egg confesses.
"But I lost my nerve. Besides, what good would it do? It certainly wouldn't
help Mother Loose." The egg sighs.
159344: Hmph. The very idea. Trolls, here? Certainly not."
159384: "Rockabye Eggy," reminisces the egg fondly. "My muvver, uh, mother,
sang me to sleep with it every night."
159464: "Stay away from there," warns the egg. "The last thing I need right now
is a child wedged in a well."
159540: "I'm worried," frets the egg. "He's always been a rascal, but I never
dreamed he would embark upon a life of crime."
159626: "Oh, him?" dismisses the egg with a short laugh. "Don't worry; he's
annoying but harmless. His sense of direction is, shall we say, rather
underdeveloped. He's forever straying out of his fairy tales and getting lost
in our nursery rhymes."
159804: "I'm not sure I approve the direction this conversation is taking,"
advises the egg with a worried frown. "What exactly are you trying to tell me?"
159912: "I don't know," hesitates the egg, doubtfully. "I'd need rather a lot
of it to protect my delicate shell."
159992: The egg coughs politely and looks away.
160020: The egg is still miffed and pays no attention to you.
160060: "I'd rather not take anything just now," explains the egg, "because I'm
a little tight on space at the moment. However, I do appreciate the thought."
He leans down to get a closer look. "Oh, I see. It's
160212: "Don't you dare!" sputters the egg, appalled at your lack of breeding.
160264: The egg is still miffed and pays no attention to you.
160304: "You can't be serious!" shrieks the egg. "What do you expect me to do?"
160358: The egg gasps with horror. "Good heavens!" he whispers. "I'm afraid
we'll have to notify the police. The wolf...oh, I just can't bear to think
about it!"
160478: In an exaggerated display of innocence, the wolf steps back, eyes wide.
"Who, me?" he protests, the very picture of shocked virtue.
160580: "Oh, thank you, thank you! Please lean it against the fence for me, and
I'll be down in a jiffy."
160652: "If I'm not mistaken, Baa Baa Industries is the primary distributor of
fine black wool in this area," notes the egg. "Why on earth are you showing
this to me?"
160768: "I'm afraid I wasn't very coherent that day," frowns the egg. "Caught
me off guard, they did."
160840: The egg wrinkles his nose. "That's disgusting. Get rid of it, please."
160902: wolf," the egg sighs, turning his attention to the wolf slouched
nearby. "This is the third occurrence in a month. How many times must I call
the king's horses and men--pardon me, I meant troops--to escort you back home?"
161064: The wolf sticks out his tongue at the egg. "Well, excuse me for living.
So, like, how many times a month do they pull you off that fence, huh?"
161172: The egg sniffs and looks in the other direction.
161208: "How very nice," observes the egg. "Do you knit or crochet?"
161324: The egg is still miffed and pays no attention to you.
161364: "I can't do much about that," shrugs the egg.
161400: The egg is still miffed and pays no attention to you.
161438: "Whee!" The egg takes a flying leap off the fence and lands smack in
the middle of the pile of wool. Tufts of wool fly into the air like dandelion
fluff, settling back down on the egg as he sits there, unmoving, his legs
splayed. You step forward to help, but the egg jumps up, grabs your hand and
shakes it vigorously, thanking you again and again. "I'm fine, I'm fine," he
repeats, as if he can't quite believe it himself.
161744: Finally, after brushing one last curl of wool from his collar, the egg
waddles away, turning to wave goodbye one last time before disappearing
completely. "You saved my life!" he shouts. "I won't forget you!"
161896: "Well..." The egg peers doubtfully at the pile of wool on the ground.
"It might work, but...it's rather a small pile, don't you think? I couldn't
possibly jump without more of a cushion for error, so to speak. I'm sure you
understand."
162072: "I simply can't bring myself to do it," the egg moans.
162112: "I most certainly will not!" shudders the egg, peering into the pot.
"Perhaps a little ptomaine poisoning wouldn't bother you, but my delicate
constitution could never survive such an assault."
162252: "I'm not hungry, thank you," the egg declines.
162288: "Well..." the egg hesitates. "No harm done, I suppose."
162336: "Pardon? I'm not quite certain what you meant."
162372: The egg notes your interest in his attire with a worried frown. "You
didn't mistake my necktie for a belt, did you?" he fusses. "Because if you did,
I should be provoked beyond endurance."
162508: You and the egg shake hands solemnly.
162536: The egg's body parts are not important, except to the egg.
162580: The egg notes your interest in his attire with a worried frown. "You
wouldn't mistake my necktie for a belt, would you?" he fusses. "Because if you
did, I should be provoked beyond endurance."
162720: The egg's wardrobe and accessories reflect his impeccable sense of
fashion and his fastidious attention to personal grooming habits. Each item
coordinates perfectly with every other item. Not a wrinkle, not a speck of
dirt, not a clash of color sullies the image he has worked so carefully to
achieve.
162928: Well, except for the handkerchief. That's a little rumpled and
sweat-stained from his current trying ordeal.
163008: Too bad he's sitting on a fence. He really does looks ridiculous.
163056: The kitten's tail twitches spasmodically; its eyes shine gold as it
concentrates on the mouse.
163124: The tiny kitten's gray and white fur is soft and silky, and its green
eyes don't miss a thing.
163192: The tiny gray and white kitten stares at you with wide, unblinking
green eyes. It meows once--the loudest meow you've ever heard--then licks one
paw and rubs its face.
163312: The gray and white kitten raises its tail and stalks stiff-legged away
from you. Without so much as a glance in your direction, the kitten sits on its
haunches and poses as regally as the Egyptian cat goddess, Bastet.
163464: The kitten is too distracted by the mouse to follow you.
163504: What makes you so sure it's a cat?
163544: The back of your hand is bleeding slightly where the kitten scratched
it.
163596: a poor, defenseless little kitten? I suppose you pull the wings off
butterflies, too? The kitten leaps into the air and rakes its claws across the
back of your hand, drawing blood. There. Let's hope that teaches you some
manners when it comes to our fine, furry friends.
163788: The kitten squirms away from you.
163812: The kitten is concentrating on the mouse and squirms out of your reach
without taking its eyes off its prey.
163936: The kitten is too busy stalking the mouse to make any noise.
163980: You scoop the squirming kitten into your arms, where it struggles to
free itself, its eyes riveted on the mouse below. The mouse, quick to recognize
this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, dashes under the door. With one last
twisting backwards flip, the kitten launches itself from your embrace and lands
on its feet, ready for battle.
164212: Without warning, a single deep, booming gong rocks the tower. Your
hands fly up involuntarily to cover and protect your ears
164336: . The vibration of the tolling bell resonates through your chest, even
after the audible tone fades. In the silence that follows, you hear the sound
of running feet, first nearby, then receding, from the other side of the door.
164494: The kitten, ever curious, shoves one paw between the threshold and the
door, groping blindly for the escaped mouse. A few swipes later, something
metallic skitters across the floor and into the corner.
164640: The kitten scampers away before you can catch it.
164676: The well is too deep to reach the kitten.
164708: The kitten has its own ideas about that. It squirms and wriggles until
you set it free again.
164776: The kitten has its own ideas about that. It squirms and wriggles until
you set it free again.
164844: Without taking its eyes off the mouse, the kitten growls low in its
throat.
164896: Alternately crouching and pouncing, the kitten stalks the flapping yarn
as it flutters tantalizingly around the whirling bobbin. Every so often, the
kitten rushes in to attack, but skitters to a stop when the spinning wheel
doesn't turn tail and run for its life.
165080: The kitten swats at the limp yarn trailing from the spinning wheel.
After a few half-hearted attempts to rouse the yarn to life, the kitten gives
up and ignores it.
165196: The kitten bounds after a butterfly, which flits gracefully and
unhurriedly to a stalk of grass just out of the kitten's reach.
165284: The kitten bounces through the tall grass, chasing a butterfly which
flutters just out of reach.
165352: A butterfly hovers close to the kitten, almost landing on its nose,
then glides away as if to say "chase me, if you dare." The kitten accepts the
invitation and leaps into the air, swiping at the butterfly with its paws.
165508: The kitten is more interested in the butterflies.
165544: You dangle the yarn in front of the kitten's nose to get its attention.
Alarmed, but ready for action, the kitten rises up on its rear legs, swatting
at the yarn with both front paws.
165712: like a snake. The kitten charges at this new enemy, overshoots its
mark, and skids into you at full speed.
165788: The kitten yawns widely and then licks its nose with a pink tongue.
165836: The kitten cocks its ears at you expectantly.
165868: The kitten ignores you and then falls over backwards when it attempts
to wash one of its hind legs.
165936: The kitten sneezes once, twice, thrice in a row. Startled, it looks up
at you as if to ask, "What was that?"
166048: rattling noisily against the inside of the well. It rests for a moment,
then quivers again.
166112: You peer down into the darkness. Something is climbing toward you,
slipping and sliding, but making progress nevertheless. Finally, after several
minutes, a tiny gray and white ball of wet fur scrambles to the top of
166264: and pokes its head into the sunshine. The kitten sneezes twice in the
daylight before leaping from
166332: to the edge of the well. It raises its tail straight up in the air like
a flagpole, marches once around the top ledge, and from there springs to the
grass at your feet. Purring, it licks one paw and washes its face.
166484: A pitiful, wailing meow floats out of the well.
166520: A faint, faraway meow is your only answer.
166552: A sound like fingernails scratching on stone drifts up from the bottom
of the well.
166612: The kitten comes running when you call it.
166644: The only answer is a faint, faraway meow.
166676: The kitten stares at you with wide green eyes.
166708: The kitten purrs and rubs against your legs.
166742: The kitten crouches low, wiggles its rear, and then pounces at nothing.
166798: The kitten rolls on its back and boxes the air.
166836: The kitten sits and watches you.
166862: The kitten meows for attention.
166890: You scratch the kitten behind the ears.
166922: The kitten follows you wherever you go.
166954: Purring, the kitten rubs up against your legs and looks at you with
sleepy green eyes.
167018: After a few moments, the kitten decides that safety resides with you
and climbs down from the tree.
167092: Two glittering green eyes stare at you from the bottom of the well.
167140: The kitten's eyes shine golden in the dim light.
167176: The kitten's eyes are golden green.
167204: Those seem to belong to the shadow at the bottom of the well.
167260: The back of your hand is bleeding slightly where the kitten scratched
it.
167312: The kitten rakes its claws across the back of your hand, drawing blood.
That'll teach you.
167412: The frisky lamb frolics in the grass, chasing butterflies in the
sunshine.
167464: Hmmm...the wolf seems very interested in the cute little lamb.
167512: The lamb bounds away and stands stiff-legged just out of your reach.
167560: "Baaa." The lamb looks at you with wide, innocent eyes.
167604: The lamb sniffs at a flower and then eats it.
167636: The lamb kicks up its heels and runs off to play.
167672: The lamb is too busy chasing butterflies to pay any attention to you.
167720: Mary points to the hairpin. "I think that belongs to a friend of mine.
She lost it last week. Want me to return it?"
167804: She's barefoot, wearing faded jeans and a red sweatshirt with the
initials "NRU" emblazoned across the front. Her short, pigtail braids stick out
from her head like two antennae; her face and hair show traces of strawberry
jam and toast, recently eaten. Two of her front teeth are missing.
168010: "That's not yours, is it?" Mary asks, pointing to the hairpin. "It
looks just like the one my friend lost last week. Want me to return it?"
168116: "That hairpin sure looks familiar," Mary insists. "My friend lost one
exactly like it last week. I think you should give it back, don't you?"
168222: "I'm certain that's my friend's hairpin," Mary blurts out. "I'd like to
give it back to her, okay?"
168304: "My hands are registered lethal weapons, you know," Mary warns, bending
her knees and assuming a karate stance that means business. "Go ahead. Make my
day."
168420: "Gross!" Mary pushes you away. "Quit that!"
168456: "Quit that! I'm not a criminal!" Mary sticks out her tongue at you.
168508: "NRU varsity softball team," Mary explains as she catches
168552: . "Here, think fast!" she grins and tosses it back. You miss.
168600: Mary is still angry and isn't speaking to you.
168636: "Sorry, I forgot what we were talking about," Mary says, distracted,
squinting at a cloud.
168704: Mary is still angry and pays no attention to you.
168740: "Are you leaving?" asks Mary. "See you later."
168780: Mary is still angry and isn't speaking to you.
168816: "Hi, there," says Mary. "Nice to meet you. When I grow up, I'm going to
eat jam and toast for breakfast every day, and I won't clean my room, ever."
168932: Mary is still angry and pays no attention to you.
168968: "What in the world are you talking about?" asks Mary.
169008: "C'mon, stop joking around," Mary pouts.
169040: "That's not very nice," scowls Mary.
169070: The wolf twiddles the hairpin at Mary and asks, "How much is it worth
to you?" Mary shrugs, half-turning away. Then, with lightning speed, she
reaches out and snatches the hairpin away from the wolf and tucks it into a
pocket of her jeans.
169244: "Who cares?" snivels the wolf. "I didn't want that old thing anyway.
Everyone knows hairpins are for sissies."
169328: Mary is still angry and pays no attention to you.
169364: "Okey dokey," Mary says graciously
169420: Mary is still angry and pays no attention to you.
169456: Mary twists a lock of hair around one finger.
169488: Mary wipes her hands on her jeans.
169512: Mary whistles through the gap in her teeth.
169544: Mary touches the tip of her nose with her tongue.
169580: Mary nibbles on her little finger.
169604: Mary balances on one foot for awhile.
169632: Mary is still angry and pays no attention to you.
169668: "Well..." Mary frowns at you and pokes her tongue through the hole
where her tooth used to be.
169740: Mary whistles through the newly created gap in her teeth before
answering.
169792: Mary looks accusingly at you as she tries to wiggle another tooth loose
with her thumb and forefinger.
169864: "I don't think so," Mary says doubtfully.
169896: "I don't know what's wrong with Bernice these days," a puzzled Mary
worries. "She used to follow me everywhere, but lately her attitude has been
horrible. I think she's got a crush on that ram down the street, Horace. He's a
bad influence."
170072: "I don't like clocks that aren't digital," Mary says firmly. "I heard
Mother Loose was supposed to fix it, but she flew the coop, so I guess we're
out of luck for the time being. So to speak."
170216: "Something valuable," Mary suggests. "So I know you'll return my
ladder."
170276: "Sorry, I forgot what we were talking about," Mary says, distracted,
squinting at a cloud.
170344: "I like him, even if he does act kind of stuffy sometimes."
170392: Throwing herself into a handstand, Mary announces from upside down:
170440: "My mom says Mr. Dumpty blames himself for what happened to Mother
Loose. She says it wasn't his fault, so he shouldn't feel bad, but I would,
wouldn't you? Feel bad, I mean."
170572: Mary's feet land with a thud, and she stands right side up again.
170620: Mary briefly turns her attention away from the ladybug's antics to
glance at you.
170680: "My mom says if nobody finds Mother Loose, Mr. Dumpty might do
something drastic."
170742: "Oh!" Mary looks worried. "You'd better get him down off that fence
quick."
170804: Mary looks relieved. "Good thing you got him down off that fence when
you did."
170864: "My friend designed all the gardens around here; didn't she do a nice
job? Her name is Mary too," she explains. "We went to school together, but she
majored in horticulture, and I majored in knock knock jokes. Sometimes she can
be very contrary. My mom says she has a green thumb, but it looks normal to
me."
171088: "How did you know my friend lost her golden hairpin?" Mary asks
suspiciously.
171144: "My friend lost it just last week," Mary explains. "If you find it,
would you please bring it here? I'd like to give it back to her."
171244: "My friend lost it last week," Mary explains. "May I please have it so
that I can give it back to her?"
171324: "Thanks a lot!" Mary says. "She's been looking everywhere for it."
171376: "My mom says Horace has an irresistible aura of danger and violence
that's very attractive to women," Mary groans, rolling her eyes. "Bernice has
it bad, all right; just look at her: she's hopelessly infatuated. I was hoping
Mother Loose could give me some advice, but that's out of the question now."
171596: "Poor thing," she sympathizes. "I hope it doesn't get eaten by a
troll."
171652: "Oh, isn't it cute!" She tickles the kitten under its chin.
171700: "That well is dangerous," shivers Mary. "Oh!" She looks at you with
wide eyes. "Maybe that's where Mother Loose..." Mary swallows hard.
171808: "I majored in knock knock jokes at NRU", she boasts. "Go ahead, try
me."
171868: "Sure, go ahead and borrow it. But please return it when you're
finished, okay? Leave it in the back, if you don't mind."
171960: "You can borrow the ladder if you'll hand over my friend's hairpin,"
Mary bargains, pointing. "Just return the ladder when you're finished, okay?"
172068: "I might let you borrow the ladder," Mary hints vaguely, "but I need
some collateral first."
172136: "I like ladybugs," Mary giggles. "They tickle."
172176: "I'm glad I have someone to play with now," Mary giggles.
172220: Mary balances on one foot, arms outstretched. "It might look messy, but
I know exactly where everything is."
172300: "My mom's okay, I guess," Mary admits. "But I wouldn't want her job for
anything. The pay is crummy, there's no career path, and the hours stink."
172412: "Mother Loose disappeared a couple of days ago," Mary answers, her
attention wandering to the ground at her feet. She stoops, holding her finger
near a blade of grass, encouraging a ladybug to crawl onto her hand.
172564: "My mom said maybe aliens from outer space abducted her," Mary says,
still engrossed with the ladybug. "I think she was kidding. C'mon, you can do
it," she reassures the beetle, which hesitates at the tip of the grass blade.
172728: The ladybug ventures off the blade of grass and onto the bridge made by
Mary's extended finger. "The news last night said maybe terrorists kidnapped
her," Mary reports, standing up. "My mom says that means they're just guessing.
She says we'll probably never know what happened."
172928: "Maybe Mother Loose didn't like her new job and just went home,"
suggests Mary, scratching her nose. "I'll bet Mr. Dumpty isn't exactly easy to
work for."
173044: "Fly away, fly away, fly away home," Mary chants, tossing the ladybug
into the air. "I guess grownups aren't supposed to get lost," she muses,
watching the ladybug as it buzzes away. "Kids get lost all the time without
people blaming it on terrorists or flying saucers from outer space."
173252: "It's a mystery, that's for sure," shrugs Mary.
173292: "They don't know what happened to Mother Loose either," says Mary, "so
they make up stuff like Alleged Terrorist Kidnappers to keep us interested."
173400: Mary looks down at the front of her sweatshirt. "Good ol' Nursery Rhyme
U. I graduated with honors."
173476: "Like it?" Mary asks. "I made it myself.
173512: "One of 'em is loose, see?" Mary demonstrates by wiggling the tooth
with her thumb and finger. "I called the Tooth Fairy and told her to get ready.
Should be any day now."
173640: "The Tooth Fairy won't pay for merchandise I can't deliver," she
grumbles. "And it's your fault."
173716: "Trolls live under bridges, I think, but we don't have any. Bridges, I
mean. If I were a troll, I'd hide in the well and scare people who stick their
heads in."
173836: "A troll lives at the bottom of that well," Mary proclaims in no
uncertain terms. "My mom told me so once when I wouldn't clean up my room."
173940: "Was that you?" Mary asks. "I heard it break, but I didn't see who did
it. I thought it was the wolf." She frowns. "I hope you didn't break it on
purpose, or I'd be really mad."
174076: "What broken window?" Mary asks suspiciously.
174112: "He's pretty good with knock knock jokes," Mary concedes, "but I'm
better."
174172: "Nope, sorry; can't help you with that," Mary apologizes.
174220: Mary is still angry and pays no attention to you.
174254: The wolf twiddles the hairpin at Mary and asks, "How much is it worth
to you?" Mary shrugs, half-turning away. Then, with lightning speed, she
reaches out and snatches the hairpin away from the wolf and tucks it into a
pocket of her jeans.
174428: "Who cares?" snivels the wolf. "I didn't want that old thing anyway.
Everyone knows hairpins are for sissies."
174512: "Thanks," Mary says, taking the hairpin. "My friend will be glad to get
this back." She shoves the hairpin into a pocket of her jeans.
174612: "Thanks very much," Mary says, taking the ladder and putting it down.
174664: "Nope, don't want it," Mary refuses.
174696: Mary is still angry and pays no attention to you.
174732: "You found it!" Mary claps her hands delightedly. "We looked
everywhere. My friend will be so glad to get it back. You do want to give it
back, don't you?"
174848: "Oh, isn't it cute!" Mary tickles the kitten under its chin.
174896: "That old thing? Sure, go ahead and borrow it. Just please return it
when you're finished."
174964: Mary is still angry and pays no attention to you.
175000: Mary is still angry and pays no attention to you.
175036: "Gross!" Mary holds her nose. "It stinks. Eat it yourself!"
175084: "I'm not hungry, thank you," Mary declines.
175120: "No. It's my friend's and she wants it back."
175156: "Hairpin? My friend lost one last week. If you know where it is, she'd
be ever so grateful if you'd return it."
175240: "You have it," Mary points out. "Give it to me, please."
175288: "I don't have it," Mary points out.
175316: "Don't be so bossy," Mary complains.
175348: "Well..." Mary hesitates. "I guess I forgive you. Kinda."
175396: "Too busy right now," Mary says, turning a cartwheel. "Maybe later."
175452: Mary refuses. "You can't make me."
175480: "You're not the boss of me," sulks Mary.
175512: Mary's two front bottom teeth are missing, and one tooth on top slants
outward at a very unlikely angle. "Wanna see a good trick?" she asks, pushing
on the top tooth with her tongue. The tooth swings up, almost horizontal with
the ground.
175680: Mary's two front bottom teeth are missing, and, thanks to you, one
upper tooth is gone as well, although since you both know where that tooth is,
you can't really say it's missing.
175830: Ouch! She bit you! 

"My tooth!" Mary screams, stomping her feet and
glaring at you. "You made me swallow my tooth! It's all your fault!"
175940: "Haven't you done enough damage?" Mary complains.
175980: Mary's hair is brown, like yours, and gathered into two pigtails that
stick straight up from her head like a bug's antennae.
176068: Mary sees you coming and steps back, assuming a karate stance that
means business. She frowns. You smile. She wins.
176152: Mary's clothes aren't important, even to Mary. She ignores them and so
can you.
176212: It's your mother! What's she doing here?
176244: You're in enough trouble as it is without asking for more.
176286: You squint, peering through the shadows. "Mom?"
176360: You've never been so glad to see your mother in all your life. You
throw your arms around her and give her a big, sloppy kiss, just like you did
when you were little.
176476: You're not allowed to talk to strangers, and although you've been doing
just that all day, you think twice about it now. After all, you're alone in a
dark room with...who? What?
176604: "Hello," smiles your mother. "I'm so glad to see you."
176648: "Very funny, but I'm not in the mood for jokes." Your mother's lips
tighten into a thin, straight line.
176724: "Your mother raises an eyebrow. "On our way home today, I think we
might discuss the difference between real life and fantasy." The slightest of
smiles tugs at her face. "Your understanding of the subject seems a trifle
vague."
176886: Crime may not pay, but honesty carries its own price tag, as you
discovered long ago. You prepare yourself for the unpleasant consequences of
telling the truth: first, of course, comes the inevitable parental lecture.
Then, your apology, complete with a Promise To Do Better Next Time. With any
luck at all, you might reduce your sentence with a Sincere Yet Cheerful
Attitude, although if you attempt this too soon you could end up in deeper
trouble for Not Taking Things Seriously.
177236: You brace yourself, ready to face the music. To your utter amazement,
you hear your mother say, "Thank you for telling me the truth. I expect you had
other things on your mind at the time."
177372: "No, I should thank you," your mother says graciously.
177416: "Sorry," apologizes Mother Loose. "I have so many things on my mind
right now that I just can't think straight. We can talk about that later."
177524: You're not allowed to talk to strangers, and although you've been doing
just that all day, you think twice about it now. After all, you're alone in a
dark room with...who? What?
177652: "I decided my first task as Mother Loose would be to fix this old
clock," explains your mother, resting her hand on one of the cables. "It hasn't
worked in years. You can't imagine how I felt when that heavy door locked
behind me, especially since summer vacation had started and no one knew I was
up here. Good thing I brought my lunch with me."
177900: "Oh, have you met my new boss?" asks your mother. "I've never worked
for an egg before, but he seems nice. A bit stuffy, maybe, but I'm sure we'll
get along just fine."
178028: "I'm starving," your mother announces. "I ate the last of my lunch
yesterday, so I started my diet today." She pats her stomach and grins at you.
"Didn't get very far did I?"
178160: "I'm glad I had my lunch with me," your mother says. "Peanut butter and
jelly sandwiches never tasted so good."
178244: "I don't think I've told you much about my new job, have I?" asks your
mother cheerfully. "I was nervous at the interview, but when I told Mr. Dumpty
about you, he said my experience as your mother qualified me for any challenge
I might face as Mother Loose."
178432: "I don't know too much more about it," your mother says.
"Unfortunately, I locked myself in here before I could schedule my orientation
tour."
178536: "I suppose it followed you here all by itself?" your mother asks,
smiling.
178592: "Of course I know who you are!" Peering at you closely, your mother
asks, "Are you all right? Did you hit your head?"
178680: "The key must have jammed the clockworks," your mother says. "When the
mouse ran up the clock, it jarred the key loose, and that's what started these
gears working again. I'll bet you could hear those bells all the way to the
forest."
178848: "Luckily, I put a bottle of water in my lunch sack," your mother
explains. "I drank most of it, but there's a little bit left."
178944: Your mother laughs. "My new boss told me all about him," she explains.
"The wolf's annoying, but harmless. I'll have a talk with him later."
179048: "Sorry," apologizes Mother Loose. "I have so many things on my mind
right now that I just can't think straight. Let's talk about that later."
179156: You're not allowed to talk to strangers, and although you've been doing
just that all day, you think twice about it now. After all, you're alone in a
dark room with...who? What?
179284: "It must have been stuck in the clockworks all this time," your mother
muses. "I'll have a duplicate made first thing in the morning."
179380: "Just a minute, dear; I'm a little woozy." She shakes her head
slightly, as if to clear it. "There. That's better."
179470: Using her no-nonsense voice, your mother says, "You haven't answered my
question. Did you
179540: As your eyes adjust to the room's dim light, you notice a shadowy
figure standing to one side.
179608: "I was just leaving," mentions the wolf as he tiptoes out the door.
179658: The shadowy figure leans forward a little, as if trying to identify
you.
179714: The shadowy figure steps forward, peering at you closely.
179760: The shadowy figure reaches for you.
179788: Your mother gathers you inside the circle of her arms and hugs until
you can hardly breathe. Then she picks you up and twirls you around, skimming
your feet over the floor as she whirls. She laughs out loud. "You found me!"
When she puts you down again, you feel a little dizzy.
179986: Sighing deeply, your mother gazes at you without saying a word. Uh, oh.
You know that look. Trouble. She crooks her finger at you to come closer, and
you step forward unwillingly, eyes focused on the floor.
180140: Putting one arm around your shoulders, she asks, "What am I going to do
with you?" She squats down, brushing your hair away from your face and leaning
close to whisper in your ear, "Did you think I wouldn't find out?"
180300: Find out what? Your mind gallops along the course of the day, trying to
remember, trying to think, trying to figure out what kind of trouble you're in
now.
180494: Planting a kiss on top of your head, your mother says, "Before I
forget, I want to tell you how proud I am of you. Not many people--adults or
children--could have done what you did today without getting into at least a
little trouble along the way. My goodness, I couldn't have done it myself
180746: How does she do that? How on earth could she possibly know what you did
or didn't do while she was locked inside the clock tower? How, how, how does
she always find out? You'd give anything to know her secret, but she won't
tell.
180914: How does she do that? How on earth could she possibly know what you did
or didn't do while she was locked inside the clock tower? How, how, how does
she always find out? You'd give anything to know her secret, but she won't
tell.
181082: A door slams in the distance. Not a moment later, you hear footsteps
clattering up the stairs, and a breathless egg rushes into the room.
181184: "The clock! I heard it!" shouts the egg. "What's going on here? Who are
you? How did you get in? When did..." He stops to wipe his face with a
sweat-soaked handkerchief, peering first at you, then at your mother. As his
eyes grow accustomed to the gloom, he gasps in recognition. "Mother Loose!
Mother Loose! Is it you? Are you all right? I'm so glad..." Then the honorable
Mr. Humpty Dumpty falls over in a dead faint.
181500: "Poor Mr. Dumpty," your mother sympathizes, kneeling next to the egg
and patting his limp hand. "Too much excitement." She winks at you. "By the
way, thanks for getting him down off that fence." You open your mouth to ask
how she knew, but close it again without bothering. She'll never tell, so
what's the use in asking?
181736: "Here, splash a little water on him," your mother suggests, handing you
a water bottle with not much water in it. You sprinkle a few drops on the egg's
eyes and they flutter a bit before one of them opens. Groaning, the egg sits
up. "It is, oh, it truly is you," he sighs happily. Both his eyes open wide
then, and he jumps...well, rises as quickly as his awkward shape will allow. "I
must inform the authorities," he announces importantly. "Mother Loose, will you
be all right? Do you need an ambulance? I can call the king's horses and
men--pardon me, I meant troops--pardon me, I meant...oh, dear, oh, dear, I
don't know what I meant!"
182206: Your mother pats the egg's hand calmly. "I just need to go home and
rest for a day or two," she says. "I'm perfectly fine, really. I'll call you
tomorrow and tell you the whole story, all right?" The egg nods and, with a
quick glance over his shoulder, bustles out of the room and down the stairs.
182424: As she pauses in the doorway, your mother says, "On our way, we need to
stop and help Mr. Dumpty get down off the fence." You open your mouth to ask
how she knew about that, but close it again without bothering. She'll never
tell, so what's the use in asking?
182616: Exhausted, you stand motionless in the center of the room, head down,
staring at the kitten winding in and out around your ankles. As you watch, the
kitten curls up on your foot, ready for a nap. You wiggle your toes, but the
drowsy kitten simply yawns. So do you. When you open your eyes (you can't
remember shutting them), the kitten is settled comfortably against your
mother's shoulder, purring.
182900: For the first time today, it doesn't struggle to free itself.
182944: Mother Loose takes your hand in hers. "Come on, sleepyhead," she
whispers. "Time to go home."
183020: And you all live happily ever after.
183092: pokes his head around the door. "Got a minute? Ain't none of my
business, but you got trouble brewin'. There's a baby stuck in a treetop out
here. When the wind blows, the cradle rocks like a rubber duckie on the high
seas. If that bough breaks, the cradle will fall and--whammo!--down will come
baby, cradle and the whole shebang, y'know what I mean?"
183348: A tiny brown field mouse with a twitchy nose and beady black eyes
stares back at you.
183408: As you reach for the mouse, it gives a terrified squeak and scurries in
the opposite direction, out of your reach.
183488: The kitten reaches out tentatively with one paw, stepping on the
mouse's tail. With a squeal of terror, the mouse wriggles free and scampers
into a dark corner.
183602: The field mouse cowers in the corner.
183634: The kitten swats the mouse with one paw, sending it sliding across the
landing where it careens into your foot. The mouse, faced with a choice between
the kitten and you, chooses the kitten and dashes back toward the door.
183792: The kitten crouches low, squirms, and then pounces for the mouse. The
mouse, more experienced than the kitten at this sort of thing, leaps straight
up into the air. The surprised kitten loses its balance and tumbles over
backward.
183956: The mouse makes a desperate attempt to escape under the door to the
south, but retreats when the kitten skids into the door first. Immediately, the
mouse circles back toward the stairs, sees you and reverses direction again,
angling diagonally across the landing and into the shadows.
184154: Panting heavily, the mouse twitches its whiskers anxiously.
184200: The kitten bounces up and down, legs stiff, back rounded, not quite
sure why this new plaything doesn't behave like the leaves that blow along the
ground.
184310: The kitten suddenly darts between your legs and zigzags up the steps
ahead of you. At that very instant, a tiny brown field mouse scurries across
your path, barely escaping with its life when you accidently step on its tail.
Chaos erupts. The terrified mouse races in circles, dodging feet and claws. The
kitten spits and hisses and rears back on its hind legs, then lunges for the
mouse. You hop on one foot, howling with pain, having twisted your ankle while
trying to avoid the mouse. To top it all off, someone...or something...is
pounding on the other side of the door at the top of the stairs.
184732: Skinny and a little ragged around the edges, he is. This wolf looks
like he could use a bite to eat. And he is looking straight at you.
184828: The wolf seems to be holding something behind his back.
184868: "Oh, yeah?" sneers the wolf. "You and who else?"
184908: "You got it bass ackwards, baby," growls the wolf.
184948: Forget it. The wolf is an expert tracker. You are not.
184988: Phewie! The wolf smells like a damp, moldy carpet.
185028: "Don't touch the merchandise," warns the wolf.
185064: with a flourish. He inspects his prize and then lifts one eyebrow at
you.
185120: "Sure you won't need this later?" he asks innocently.
185160: "Oh, wow, thanks," he drawls. "You're all heart."
185204: "Huh?" The wolf raises an eyebrow.
185232: "Little green men?" grins the wolf, rolling his eyes. "Yeah, right."
185288: "Hey, man, I didn't do it," whines the wolf. "It broke all by itself.
Honest!"
185352: "Huh?" The wolf raises an eyebrow.
185380: "An egg? On a fence? Okay, okay, I'll bite." The wolf howls with
laughter. "Get it? I'll bite! Oh, man, that's a good one!"
185480: "An egg? On a fence? That cracks me up!" The wolf howls with laughter.
"Get it? Cracks me up! Oh, man, that's a good one!"
185576: "All the better to hear you with, my dear!" grins the wolf.
185620: "All the better to see you with, my dear!" winks the wolf.
185664: "Watch it," growls the wolf, "or you'll be talking to my lawyer."
185716: "I don't know nothin' about nothin'," the wolf insists.
185760: "Ain't seen him around much lately," says the wolf. "Maybe he found
hisself a new girlfriend, more his style than Bernice. I mean, how much
sweetness and light can a guy take?"
185888: "You may not know this, but knock knock jokes are my specialty." The
wolf takes the toothpick out of his mouth and points it at you. "Watch. I'll
demonstrate."
186004: "Can't get enough of 'em, eh?" winks the wolf. "OK, here's one you may
have heard before, but I still like it."
186090: Police open the door; it's cold out here!"
186128: The wolf howls with laughter, tears running helplessly down his face.
186180: The wolf rolls on the ground, snorting and holding his sides. After a
while, he gets up. "Whew," he sighs, wiping tears of laughter from his eyes.
186288: "Doris locked; that's why I'm knocking."
186326: "Clear as mud?" asks the wolf, noticing your puzzled look. "The DOOR IS
locked; that's why I'm knocking. See? Pretty good, huh?"
186434: "Venice somebody going to open the door?"
186470: "Whoa, baby!" The wolf slaps his thigh and guffaws. "Now, that's what I
call funny!"
186540: "Wendy wind blows, the cradle will rock."
186574: "Get it?" snickers the wolf, poking you in the side with an elbow.
186628: "Annie one know what a henway is? No, what's a henway? Oh, about three
pounds!"
186692: The wolf roars with laughter, staggering helplessly in circles until he
regains his composure.
186760: "Yeah, sure, I'd like to get my paws on Bernice," drools the wolf.
"Problem is, anything ever happens to that spoiled brat, everybody and his
brother comes after me, pronto. I don't got a snowball's chance in August of
gettin' away with it."
186936: "Who?" The wolf sniffs haughtily. "Oh, you mean Miss Smarty Pants? She
thinks she knows all the best knock knock jokes, but I got news for her. I been
practicing."
187060: The wolf grins widely. "Sure thing. Just step over here where I can get
a better look at you," he coaxes. "Come on, don't be shy."
187160: "Yeah, yeah, yeah," the wolf whines. "Sure, I heard them rumors. So
what?"
187220: "How should I know where she is?" grumbles the wolf.
187260: "She was new on the job," growls the wolf. "Maybe she quit."
187308: "Gimme a break," barks the wolf. "I ain't seen her."
187352: "I already told you," complains the wolf. "I didn't do nothin'."
187404: "My conscience is clear," insists the wolf.
187436: The wolf eyes you suspiciously. "How come you're so nosy?"
187480: "You're new around here," hints the wolf. "Maybe the cops should talk
to you instead of intimidating me every chance they get."
187572: "Oh, skip it," sighs the wolf, exasperated. "Nobody believes me
anyhow."
187628: "Uh, she's a friend of mine, y'know? Nice folks. Too bad about her
grandma."
187688: "Nice kid, yeah? Too bad about her grandma."
187724: "Haven't seen her around lately. Maybe I'll pay her a little visit when
I gets the chance."
187792: "All the better to eat you with, my dear!" slobbers the wolf.
187840: "So, like, what's the big deal about bacon for breakfast?" asks the
wolf, licking his chops.
187908: "Hey, I'm a wolf, okay? Wolves eat pigs. You got a problem with that?"
187964: "Well, la-dee-dah. You ain't one of them vegetarians, are you? What'd
you eat for dinner last night? Carrots?"
188048: The wolf snarls at you and chews on a toothpick.
188110: with a flourish. He inspects his prize and then lifts one eyebrow at
you.
188168: "Sure you won't need this later?" he asks innocently.
188208: "Oh, wow, thanks," he drawls. "You're all heart."
188252: "The shy and retiring type, I see," leers the wolf, shifting the
toothpick from one side of his mouth to the other.
188336: The wolf sees his chance and grabs it. "Ah, yes," he smirks. "I believe
you're referring to the bureaucrat straddling the fence over there. Kinda
poetic, ain't it?"
188458: At this, the egg flushes a ghastly shade of pink. "Despite the personal
insults I must endure, I am proud to call myself a public servant," the egg
sputters, glaring indignantly at the wolf, who seems to be whistling at the
sky.
188624: The wolf snickers. "Seems to me," he suggests, honey dripping from his
voice, "that you ought to call yourself a few more public servants to get you
down from there."
188746: With an airy wave of one paw, the wolf strolls away. "I best be
moseying along now, don't you think? See you later."
188836: "So?" shrugs the wolf. "You want I should do something about it?"
188888: "So? You want I should do something about it?" shrugs the wolf.
188936: "Yeah, right. No problemo," sneers the wolf in a voice tinged with
sarcasm. "Sure, raw eggs is one of my favorite delicacies. But, y'know, believe
it or not, assassination of public officials is sorta frowned on in these
parts. Typical government interference with the rights of private citizens, if
you ask me."
189160: "A smart aleck, huh?" The wolf eyes you curiously. "Better watch what
you ask for, kiddo. You might get it."
189244: "Nah," declines the wolf. "I don't eat nothing with claws sharper than
mine."
189304: "Yeah, sure, I'd like to get my paws on Bernice," drools the wolf.
"Problem is, anything ever happens to that spoiled brat, everybody and his
uncle comes after me, pronto. I don't got a snowball's chance in August of
gettin' away with it."
189480: "No way," refuses the wolf. "She's one tough kid."
189520: "Hey, I'm a carnivore! Show a little respect, will ya?" The wolf
wrinkles his nose at the pease porridge in the pot. "That stuff's gotta be nine
days old, at least. Yuck."
189648: "Uh, maybe later," declines the wolf. "I try not to snack between
meals."
189704: "Not a chance," the wolf snarls. "Get your own pacifier."
189748: "Yeah, right, like I'm a charitable institution or somethin'." The wolf
grins at you with big, yellow teeth.
189828: "Hmmm..." The wolf hesitates, shifting the toothpick to the other side
of his mouth. "Ask me again; I might feel generous. Then again, maybe I won't."
189944: "All right, all right! Quit yer whining." The big, bad wolf dangles
189996: just out of your reach. 

You screw up your courage and snatch
190044: back. The wolf howls with laughter.
190072: "Yeah, right, like I'm a charitable institution or something." The wolf
grins at you with big, yellow teeth.
190152: "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure thing. Whatever you say, kiddo."
190200: "I didn't quite catch your drift," shrugs the wolf.
190240: "Huh?" The wolf raises an eyebrow.
190268: The whispery rustling grows louder.
190294: You glance around nervously. The rustling seems very close now.
190344: Suddenly, without warning, the kitten rockets up a nearby tree. At the
same moment
190404: , from the corner of your eye, you glimpse a streak of moth-eaten fur
hurtling toward you from the forest! Your heart races, yet you stand paralyzed
with fear; your mind screams at your unresponsive body to flee. Run! Run for
your life!

Too late. Alas, too late.

"Boo!" snarls a big, bad wolf, who is
huffing and puffing from all the exertion. His eyes narrow into slits as he
studies you closely. "Hey, wait just a minute! You ain't Little Red Riding
Hood."
190740: The wolf sidles up beside you. "Having trouble?" he asks. "Not to brag
or nothin', but I consider myself an expert knock knock joker."
190840: "Don't mind me; I was just leaving," mentions the wolf over his
shoulder as he skulks out of sight.
190916: "Later," growls the wolf, waving a paw in your direction as he trots
past.
190972: "I'll be right back," confides the wolf.
191006: The wolf leaves after a quick reconnaissance.
191042: "I'm blowin' this joint," the wolf explains as he shoves his way past
you. "I got places to go, people to see, things to do."
191140: "I'm outta here," the wolf announces loudly.
191176: You notice a familiar-looking wolf lurking in the vicinity.
191220: "Heads up!" shouts the wolf in your ear. "Ha, ha, made you look!"
191274: The wolf is back again, hanging around.
191308: "Hey, what are you doing?" demands the wolf suspiciously.
191354: A slight movement attracts your attention. It's that wolf again.
191406: "Surprise!" The wolf jumps out in front of you. "Gotcha that time,
didn't I?"
191472: "Did you miss me?" barks the wolf. "I'm back."
191512: The kitten skitters a little closer to you for protection.
191556: The kitten hisses at the wolf from behind your ankles.
191596: The kitten arches its back and hisses at the wolf.
191634: The wolf shifts the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the other.
191686: The wolf leans casually on one elbow and watches you, chewing on his
toothpick.
191744: The wolf grins at you as he twirls the toothpick in his mouth.
191788: The wolf yawns widely enough for you to count all his teeth.
191832: The wolf loiters in the area, keeping an eye on you.
191870: "Listen up," warns the wolf. "In case you forgot, I get blamed for
everything around here. So watch it. I ain't takin' no rap for you."
191976: It's an ordinary toothpick in an extraordinary situation. Sort of like
you.
192032: Nursery Rhyme University, of course.
192098: "Mother Loose" (so named because it is loosely based on several Mother
Goose nursery rhymes) was written for two reasons: I wanted to learn more about
object-oriented programming and, at the same time, hoped to encourage my
six-year-old granddaughter to read for fun. I began by toying with the idea of
writing the entire game as one long nursery rhyme, which led to a rather feeble
poem, now preserved forever as the answer to "Who am I?" in the game itself, as
well as in the "What's going on here?" section of the Help menu.
192476: Obviously, poetry as interactive fiction presents significant
limitations, so I decided to stick with prose. Even then, I didn't realize how
difficult it would be to write a simple children's game (much more difficult
than writing for adults, oddly enough), and I eventually abandoned that goal as
well. Older children might get a kick out of "Mother Loose," but younger
children will have difficulty reading small text on a wide screen, won't like
the lack of pictures, don't understand why compass directions are important,
and become frustrated when their poor spelling and typing skills result in
error messages.
193258: mint-fiction, where no question is too dumb to ask (or answer). Thank
you all.
193734: I apologize right here and now for not allowing an unlimited inventory,
but since this rule is enforced only when you are carrying obviously bulky or
heavy items, it shouldn't be too difficult to live with.
194354: during the beta testing period alone. Looking back now, if I had
released "Mother Loose" when I thought it was ready, I would have crawled under
a rock from embarrassment. Thank you, thank you, thank you to all my beta
testers. You are worth your weight in gold.
194544: Please report any oddities, omissions, or suggestions for improvement
to:
194618: Enjoy. Jennifer and I hope you have as much fun playing "Mother Loose"
as we did creating it.

November, 1998
194708: The following commands perform general housekeeping duties and don't
take up any game time, so feel free to use them whenever you want:
195296: These commands advance the game one turn each time they are used:
195888: It's been one of those days. It started out bad and just got worse:
195936: You're seven years old and in trouble a lot. You try to be good and to
do as you ought, but nothing, it seems, goes exactly as planned. For instance,
today things got quite out of hand: you poured your own milk, but it spilled on
the floor; the cat wanted out just as you slammed the door; you didn't remember
to turn off the faucet; your brother, poor thing, is still locked in the
closet.
196216: But that wasn't all. No, indeed. Did I mention that things got much
worse? They did. Pay attention: you're lost and alone and nothing's familiar.
You wander around for a while until you're ready to panic. Then, out of the
blue, an egg on a fence asks for help--and from you!
196612: What's going on here?
196744: Congratulations. You've already rescued Humpty Dumpty.
196786: Humpty Dumpty sat on a...fence? Humpty Dumpty hadn't much sense.
196840: He'd like to get down, but he's afraid to jump.
196876: Have you tried shaking the fence or pulling Humpty Dumpty?
196920: Do you think he might jump into something soft and cushiony?
196964: Maybe a nice, soft pile of wool?
196990: Yes, sir, three bags full might do it.
197022: Three bags empty might be better.
197050: But where might you find three bags of wool around here?
197092: Inside the cottage. Unfortunately, you've locked yourself out.
197140: Maybe you could borrow a ladder instead. Better ask first.
197184: Unfortunately, you've thrown the wool down the well.
197224: Maybe you could borrow a ladder instead. Better ask first.
197268: Mary won't let you borrow the ladder without some collateral.
197312: And the only collateral she'll take is the golden hairpin.
197354: Unfortunately, you've locked the hairpin inside the cottage.
197400: Sorry. You can't finish the game without the hairpin.
197440: But where might you find three bags of wool around here?
197480: Inside the cottage. Unfortunately, you've locked yourself out.
197528: Sorry. You can't finish the game without the hairpin.
197568: But where might you find three bags of wool around here?
197608: Congratulations. You've already found the golden hairpin.
197652: Did you take a good look inside the pot?
197682: There seems to be something in there besides pease porridge.
197728: Maybe you could fish it out with the spoon.
197760: Then again, maybe not. Did you taste the pease porridge?
197802: Yuck. You could've just emptied the pot.
197836: Well, you've ruined the pease porridge reference by throwing the pot
down the well without taking a good look inside it. Nice going.
197930: This is your last chance. Go back to the forest and look around.
197980: Congratulations. You've already opened the cottage door.
198022: The cottage door is locked, but the window isn't.
198062: The window won't open enough for you to climb in. Too bad.
198108: Maybe you could break the window.
198134: Looks like you'll just have to pick the lock on the door.
198178: Hmmm...what would make a good lockpick?
198212: Shiny golden hairpins might prove useful in this situation.
198254: But you've already given the hairpin to Mary.
198290: You can't get into the cottage now. But you can still win the game.
198342: Congratulations. You've already convinced Mary to come out and play.
198396: Mary had a little lamb that followed her to school some days.
198440: But Mary graduated. With honors.
198466: Did you read the placard on her bungalow door?
198502: Mary is an expert in the field of knock knock jokes.
198542: "Knock knock" at the bungalow door will get Mary's attention.
198590: The wolf seems to think he's a pretty funny fellow.
198630: The wolf might know a knock knock joke or two. Ask him.
198674: You haven't met the wolf yet. Go back to the Deep Forest and hang
around for a bit. He'll show up eventually.
198758: Congratulations. You've already rescued the kitten.
198800: Poor kitty. It's stuck at the bottom of the well.
198838: The well seems fairly primitive: no bucket, no rope, no crank.
198886: Bucket: a vessel for carrying liquids.
198918: Rope: a stout cord of fibers twisted or braided together.
198962: Crank: a handle connected at right angles to the shaft of a machine in
order to transmit circular motion.
199038: Have you searched the cottage yet?
199066: Bucket: a vessel for carrying liquids.
199098: Rope: a stout cord of fibers twisted or braided together.
199142: Crank: a handle connected at right angles to the shaft of a machine in
order to transmit circular motion.
199218: The pot might substitute for a bucket.
199248: And what about that spinning wheel in the cottage?
199284: Doesn't it have some yarn wound around the bobbin?
199322: Unfortunately, you've locked yourself out of the cottage.
199366: So, you can't use the spinning wheel with the pot and yarn. Oh, well.
199420: Hey, wasn't there a ladder lying around here somewhere?
199462: It seems to belong to someone, though. Maybe you could borrow it.
199512: Mary won't let you borrow the ladder without some collateral.
199556: And the only collateral she'll take is the golden hairpin.
199598: But the hairpin is locked in the cottage.
199630: Sorry. You can't finish the game without the hairpin.
199672: You could tie the yarn to the pot and put the pot in the well...
199720: But you can't get near the spinning wheel while it's turning.
199766: How can it spin without someone to operate it?
199802: Maybe it's battery operated. Take a look underneath it.
199846: Flip the toggle switch off first.
199874: Uh, oh. Did you forget to tie the yarn to the bobbin?
199916: Too bad. Better figure out another way to rescue the kitty.
199960: Hey, wasn't there a ladder lying around here somewhere?
200002: It seems to belong to someone, though. Maybe you could borrow it.
200052: Mary won't let you borrow the ladder without some collateral.
200096: And the only collateral she'll take is the golden hairpin.
200138: But the hairpin is locked in the cottage.
200170: Sorry. You can't finish the game without the hairpin.
200212: Don't even think about climbing down the well. It's much too dangerous.
200266: But you might convince the kitten to climb up.
200302: Hey, wasn't there a ladder lying around here somewhere?
200346: It seems to belong to someone, though. Maybe you could borrow it.
200396: Mary won't let you borrow the ladder without some collateral.
200440: And the only collateral she'll take is the golden hairpin.
200482: Don't even think about climbing down the well. It's much too dangerous.
200538: But you might convince the kitten to climb up.
200574: Congratulations. You've already dislodged the clock tower key.
200622: Hickory, dickory dock. The mouse ran up the clock.
200662: Clock towers usually contain clocks.
200692: Mouse? What mouse? You don't see any mouse.
200728: The kitten seems to have adopted you after its rescue.
200768: Have you paid a visit to the clock tower lately?
200804: The mouse can't run up the clock because the cat won't let it.
200850: The mouse might escape if the cat would just leave it alone.
200896: Ding, dong bell. Pussy's in the well.
201052: Before you can reply, the bungalow door slams open and a voice shouts:
201104: Shouting and giggling, the two of you finish the joke in unison:
201152: The yarn is already tied to the bobbin and the pot handle.
201192: You dare not put your fingers anywhere near the bobbin while it's
spinning.
201244: You tie the loose end of the yarn to the bobbin.
201280: You tie one end of the yarn to the bobbin.
201312: The yarn is already tied to the bobbin.
201340: You tie the other end of the yarn to the pot handle.
201376: The other end of the yarn is already tied to the pot handle.
201420: You can only do that to the curtains.
201448: "Uh, maybe later," declines the wolf. "I try not to snack between
meals."
201536: You've already met. It was a long time ago; you must have forgotten.
201588: I apologize for disabling the wide inventory listing in this game. My
Inform programming skills are not yet good enough to handle the wide display
when the yarn is tied to anything. I promise that future games will not have
this limitation.
201756: "Anita little help from my friends!"
201784: "Annie one know what a henway is? No, what's a henway? Oh, about three
pounds!"
201844: "Arthur any more good jokes like this one?"
201876: "Carl get you there quicker than walking!"
201908: "Gladys sunny outside, aren't you?"
201936: "Irish you could come out to play!"
201964: "Isabelle not working? Get it fixed!"
201996: "Ivan to come in. Open the door!"
202024: "Justin time; I thought you'd never finish this joke!"
202068: "Lettuce in! It's cold out here!"
202096: "Minnie times I've knocked on this door and you still haven't opened
it!"
202152: "Orange you going to open the door for me?"
202184: "Police open the door; it's cold out here!"
202220: "Venice somebody going to open this door?"
202252: "Wanda come out and play with me?"
202280: "Wayne, wayne, go away; come again another day!"
202320: "Wendy wind blows, the cradle will rock!"
202352: Before you can reply, the bungalow door slams open and a voice shouts:
202404: Shouting and giggling, the two of you finish the joke in unison:
202452: Then a whirlwind--no, it's a little girl--hurtles through the door and
almost collides with you. "I just love knock knock jokes, don't you?" she
giggles, clapping her hands and pirouetting in place. "I'm Mary. Who are you?"
202620: "Isn't this fun?" laughs Mary,
202752: Mary pouts, "That's not right. You have to say knock knock first."
202804: Uh, oh. You're talking to yourself--not a good sign.
202844: Uri Geller you are not. You can't unbend the spoon.
202884: A hollow voice says, "Fooled you!"
202912: Did you know that you can rescue Mother Loose without getting into any
trouble at all? Yep, it's true. But the hints won't help you. Sorry. (Actually,
that's not quite true. The hints will help you stay out of trouble if you
manage to mess things up in a way I refuse to reveal here.) By the way, in case
you were wondering, staying out of trouble is the only way to score all 50
points. However, a little mischief here and there makes for a lot more fun!
Below are some of the naughty deeds you missed:
203276: Eat the porridge with the dirty spoon you picked up off the ground.
203328: Push the egg, or kick him, or even scramble, poach or fry him.
203380: Break into the cottage and burglarize it.
203416: Win friends and influence people by pulling Mary's loose tooth.
203468: Remove Mary's placard from the bungalow door.
203508: Contaminate the water supply by throwing trash down the well.
203556: Throw the pease porridge at something (or someone).
203600: Don't return Mary's ladder.
203628: Well, well. Apparently, you've managed to ferret out all the various
methods of getting yourself into trouble, at least in this game. That's quite a
feat of adventuring! Congratulations, and I hope you don't live in my
neighborhood.
203796: Congratulations on rescuing Mother Loose without getting into any
trouble whatsoever! But I'll bet you didn't have as much fun as you could have,
did you? Go on, live a little! Eat the porridge with the dirty spoon you picked
up off the ground. Scramble the egg. Or push him off the fence. Vandalise some
private property--try breaking windows, slamming doors and jumping on
furniture. Burglarize the cottage and take what you want. Win friends and
influence people by pulling Mary's loose tooth. Contaminate the water
supply--throw trash down the well. Kick the cat. Pull its tail. Lie to your
mother. Go on, live dangerously!
