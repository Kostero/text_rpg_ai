8955: Please answer yes or no.
8986: Are you sure you want to quit?
9022: Are you sure you want to restart?
9055: Failed.
9074: Restore failed.
9087: Ok.
9101: Save failed.
9112: Ok.
9123: The game file has verified as intact.
9150: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupted (unless you
are playing it with a very primitive interpreter which is unable properly to
perform the test).

9341: Transcripting is already off.
9364: End of transcript.
9433: Verbs such as "take", "drop", "open", and "examine" are not relevant in
this work. They will not be understood. Instead, your part is to type the names
of objects (or attributes or aspects of objects) that you see in the narrative.
When you refer to an object, it will be brought into greater prominence,
changing the course of the narrative thread. Or it might be reduced to lesser
stature, or removed entirely. You'll have to experiment. Typing the same name
second time may cancel the effect of the first time, or the effect may be
cumulative. The order in which you type names may or may not be important.
9975: The standard game-control commands do work as you'd expect:
10022: UNDO: Undo the effects of your last move.
10057: SAVE, RESTORE: Save and restore your position.
10100: RESTART: Return to the initial position.
10137: QUIT: End the session.
10160: SCRIPT, UNSCRIPT: Turn transcripting on and off.

10429: This work was created as part of an artistic endeavor invented by
Kristin Looney. Around March 1997, she invited a bunch of people to do
independent creative works -- any medium, any form, but all with the title
10591: Around the same time, I had been turning over some ideas about
non-traditional IF. Okay, I thought, let's do both. This is the result.
10838: This work (despite its quirks) was created using the Inform adventure
development system, which was created by Graham Nelson. You can get Inform, as
well as other text adventures, from the Interactive Fiction archive:

13386: whnopen, one pane laid back. As always, you strain to see what lies in
the room below, and fail -- there is only tinted glass, and the darkness of the
opening.
13594: The window is open, one pane laid back. As always, you strain to see
what lies
13672: below, and fail. There is only tinted glass over darkness
13846: . You are caught, suddenly, by your own eyes
13893: uxm. You are caught, suddenly, by your own eyes
14032: . Nothing could
14189: .

Not ever. You reach for the pane, and slam it shut.
14232: The window shatters.
14329: Only a reflection. You look up, suddenly, away from the dark glass.
There is nothing of darkness above you; only blue air and the wind.
14430: The window shatters.
14705: . The table is set for two
14788: . The cold shadow lifts a little
14843: . An empty vase, white glass, stands beside a single lit candle
14902: . A smile touches you; it feels like the first one in some time
15026: . She climbs up
15106: . She smiles, too, at the flowers
15191: you can see little more than that. Candlelight
15241: . Her eyes meet yours. They are cool, her eyes, and her lips
15819: The window is open, so you climb down into dimness. The table is set
15880: . An empty vase glows, white glass catching the light of a single candle
15931: . The rest of the room shades into obscurity
16029: . It seems appropriate; you lean forward to fill the white glass with
living
16254: . Hair gleams softly
16293: : a woman. She glances around
16346: . She sits
16361: Hm.
16425: . You do not know what sign there is to wait for
16463: . Time slips past, and past, and away
16504: . It looms in the dark, whatever it is. You can almost feel its shape
16555: .

Perhaps the woman can as well
16591: ypm. She stirs restlessly. Hair brushes the table, falls back. The
candleflame wavers. You take a breath
16668: .

What you await, arrives. The window shatters.
16716: .

There remains silence
16749: . If you do not dare to break it, she does not care to, it seems
16809: .

And which is easier? You reach for a word in the dark. The window
shatters.
16887: .

And which is more difficult? The silence flows on, unended.

The
window shatters.
16979: Dhm.

The shadows dance slowly in the candlelight
17064: epm. The shadows seem to ripple and fold around you
17107: Xm.
17161: . You freeze; but the sound is not repeated
17202: . You freeze. For a moment nothing; then it comes again
17253: . You freeze. For a moment nothing; then it comes again. Another. Closer
17316: opm. Then another, as you freeze in the shade. -- And another step, and
another -- something is approaching
17487: --

You pull deeper into the shadows, and they draw you in, away from
the room, away from everything, the fear. Something steps from the door far
behind, but you are hurtling, receding into the dark.

The window shatters.
18175: grass. The stalks lean in the breeze, with colors flashing through --
bright flowers grow here and there
18262: . Red and blue, orange and white and secretive grey, all peering from
behind the dusty green grass
18346: . The wind is clean, though, clear of the cloying scents of the flowers
below
18414: . You rise to your feet, your mind pulled by the wind, pulled from the
flowers and the space below the window, off towards the horizon....
18527: You can only follow. Behind you, the window shatters.
18575: . No distractions
18602: Enough of that. Delay will make nothing easier
18792: . The bright colors hurt your eyes
18825: . The colors clash garishly, but the scents are an odd cool sweet note
that leaves you slightly dizzy, uncertain what you see
18920: . The scents intertwine, cool and invigorating
18963: . The spicy tang of the snaps cuts through the cool blue scent, leaving
you nearly gasping
19034: . A faint sea-scent is heightened by sweetness into beauty
19085: . The distant sea-smell curls elusively
19122: . The spicy tang burns against the heavy salt odor, bringing sudden
tears to your eyes
19191: . The scents blend into rich sweetness
19228: . The spicy sweetness seems suddenly familiar, as immediate as your
first spring morning
19297: o.. The thick spicy smells burst upon you; you grin, pleased, even
excited -- you can barely keep still
19414: . You stand, and walk
19799: . The table is set for two
19866: ahddhm. The cold shadow lifts a little
19902: . An empty vase, white glass, stands beside a single lit candle
19960: . A smile touches you; it feels like the first one in some time
20047: . She climbs up, lowers it quietly back into place
20096: . (Always careful, and always quiet. It took months before you saw past
that.)
20171: She smiles, too, at the flowers.
20198: Her face is a soft curve; in the dimness, you can see little more than
that. Candlelight
20268: "Sit," she says, and you do. Then she waits
20312: uhm. It strikes you that you have not seen her smile
20355: Ipm.
20366: However long you wait, she never does.

The window shatters.
20429: . Quiet, and careful, and attentive; and it's still your turn
20481: You turn your face away from the light. "Well."
20530: Some things are impossible, you've always known that.
20596: . Some words don't exist, not anywhere inside you
20695: . She could not wait, the thought is like
20800: Mpm.
20855: . The window shatters.
21079: . The table is set for two
21146: ahddhm. The cold shadow lifts a little
21182: . An empty vase, white glass, stands beside a single lit candle
21240: . A smile touches you; it feels like the first one in some time
21327: . She climbs up, lowers it quietly back into place
21374: . She smiles, too, at the flowers
21401: . Her dress is a curve of soft folds; in the dimness, you can see little
more than that. Candlelight
21485: . There, and in her eyes
21509: "Sit," you say, but she does not. She shifts, uncomfortable, futilely
adjusting her dress. You wait
21590: Pm. The silence spreads, and she shakes her head desperately. No?
21678: . The sudden light nearly stops you; but you manage not to look away
21740: . Reflecting the light, not refracting
21769: . Her mouth quirks suddenly
21860: leh    Mxm.

She opens her mouth to speak
21918: . The window shatters.
21956: . The silence spreads, and she shakes her head desperately. No? She will
not meet your gaze, and you can only wait
22327: . The table is set for two
22348: . An empty vase, white glass, stands beside a single lit candle
22435: . She climbs up, drops it firmly back into place
22470: . Her eyes meet yours coolly
22561: "So you did come," she begins
22613: . The lines of her face have gone hard
22645: . You look back up, and find the lines of her face gone hard
22744: "I wouldn't dream," you quote
22786: . The self-mockery is thin in your voice
22817: . She opens her mouth
22898: . "Shall we leave it all here, then?"
22947: Just as abruptly, her mouth twists. The tension falls from her like
silent snow; and then you see, you are shocked to see, a wry smile. "What
better place?" she asks, and reaches for the door.
23093: She adds, as she climbs down, "Never speak to me again." The door shuts.
The window shatters.
23245: . "Yes. That's the way... Yes."
23281: Her eyes fall to the table, then, and she leans towards the candleflame.
The window shatters.
23366: . "Yes. That's..." She breaks off, becomes absolutely motionless
23424: "Yes?" No self-mockery now.

She makes a sharp gesture, repelling. The
window shatters.
23851: . The table is set for two
23872: . An empty vase, white glass, stands beside a single lit candle
23959: . She climbs up, drops it firmly back into place
23994: . The line of her lips is cold
24058: "So you did come," you begin
24110: . She looks up at that; but the sharpness surprised you too
24155: . After a moment you shake your head. "It doesn't make a difference
24213: "I never dreamed it would." She tosses her head back suddenly
24320: . "It seemed appropriate, that's all. Here. Finally." The flame of the
candle flickers uncertainly, but her voice is still
24475: . "...Shall we go?"
24674: dof Du      imupm. You lean forward and blow. The window shatters.
24757: . "Jesus, but where else could we be?" Now the smile is a grin. "You
don't actually think the Universe would let us finish up anywhere else. I
mean...
24934: . "It is awfully... You can't be serious
25088: Finally you straighten up, and she leans against a wall, wiping her
face. The words pass between you: "I'm going to miss you." And the window
shatters.
25843: . The table is set
25933: From stillness, the flame dances wildly. The draft touches your own
cheek as the door begins to swing up
26018: . You leap, and the door slams down under your weight, but the movement
only makes the candle snap and gutter more sharply
26103: . You hold your breath
26132: ; and slowly the flame steadies, slowly, back to stillness.

And below
you -- stillness, as well.

The window shatters.
26241: ; and in the silence, you hear a faint moan from below you.

The flame
chokes and dies. A moment later, the window shatters.
26429: The door opens. Her shadow bends grotesque and swollen across the wall
as she climbs up
26502: . You suddenly cannot think of a thing to say; her familiar face is
alien, as twisted as the shadow behind her
26630: . "Well?", she asks, sharply
26661: Jhm.

"Absolutely not," you snap. Without a sound, the window shatters.
26749: . You strain against yourself
26772: . For a moment you cannot speak
26860: -- a surprise; you didn't think you were expected. The cold shadow lifts
a little. Yes
26927: . A single ivory candle radiates soft light
26958: . A smile touches you; it feels like the first one in some time
27046: You gaze quietly into the flame. Your heart slows, as the peace of the
room flows through you. The light seems to grow brighter. Candlelight.

After a
very long time, the window shatters.
27238: epm. She climbs up, lowers it quietly back into place
27306: . She smiles, too, at the light
27343: . In the dimness, you can see little more of her than that
