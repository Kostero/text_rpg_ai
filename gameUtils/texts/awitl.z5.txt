11318: Nothing to do!
11353: o. You have won
11611: Please give one of the answers above.
11642: It is now pitch dark in here!
11669: I beg your pardon?
11687: dxn[You can't "undo" what hasn't been done!]
11729: ehn[Can't "undo" twice in succession. Sorry!]
11801: Sorry, that can't be corrected.
11830: Think nothing of it.
11851: "Oops" can only correct a single word.
11885: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
11936: As good-looking as ever.
11960: To repeat a command like "frog, jump", just say "again", not "frog,
again".
12023: You can hardly repeat that.
12048: You can't begin with a comma.
12076: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
12151: To talk to someone, try "someone, hello" or some such.
12219: I didn't understand that sentence.
12289: I didn't understand that number.
12318: You can't see any such thing.
12345: You seem to have said too little!
12374: You aren't holding that!
12398: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
12438: You can only use multiple objects once on a line.
12478: I'm not sure what "
12513: You excepted something not included anyway!
12549: You can only do that to something animate.
12584: That's not a verb I recognise.
12614: That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.
12668: You can't see "
12711: I didn't understand the way that finished.
12803: Nothing to do!
12820: There are none at all available!
12894: Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which exactly?
13867: Please answer yes or no.
13893: Are you sure you want to quit?
13929: Are you sure you want to restart?
13961: Failed.
13981: Restore failed.
13998: Ok.
14016: Save failed.
14031: Ok.
14049: The game file has verified as intact.
14081: The game file did not verify as intact, and may be corrupt.
14137: Transcripting is already on.
14185: Attempt to begin transcript failed.
14225: Transcripting is already off.
14273: Attempt to end transcript failed.
14303: Score notification on.
14324: Score notification off.
14347: You have visited:
14375: Objects you have handled:
14400: None.
14786: You are carrying nothing.
14835: Taken.
14846: You are always self-possessed.
15228: You're carrying too many things already.
15406: Dropped.
15516: Removed.
15605: You can't put something on top of itself.
15682: You lack the dexterity.
15763: Done.
15962: You can't put something inside itself.
16053: Done.
16289: Wrahn seem interested.
16508: You can only get into something freestanding.
16745: But you aren't in anything at the moment.
16859: You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.
16961: You can't go that way.
17147: is now in its normal "brief" printing mode, which gives long
descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.
17249: is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).
17337: is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives short descriptions
of locations (even if you haven't been there before).
17811: But it's dark.
17828: You find nothing of interest.
17864: But it's dark.
17955: You find nothing of interest.
19125: . Not bad.
19143: That was a rhetorical question.
19170: This dangerous act would achieve little.
19204: Nothing practical results from your prayer.
19240: The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.
19277: That seems unnecessary.
19300: Keep your mind on the game.
19325: What a good idea.
19344: You smell nothing unexpected.
19371: You hear nothing unexpected.
19396: You taste nothing unexpected.
19431: Keep your hands to yourself!
19456: You feel nothing unexpected.
19481: If you think that'll help.
19507: Digging would achieve nothing here.
19574: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.
19607: You would achieve nothing by this.
19636: There's nothing suitable to drink here.
19669: But there's no water here to carry.
19700: Oh, don't apologise.
19722: Real adventurers do not use such language.
19757: Quite.
19768: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
19801: There's not enough water to swim in.
19832: There's nothing sensible to swing here.
19896: You achieve nothing by this.
19984: You wave, feeling foolish.
20134: You are unable to.
20153: Nothing obvious happens.
20176: That would be less than courteous.
20214: Is that the best you can think of?
20243: That's not a direction.
20266: Not that way you can't.
20298: Keep your hands to yourself.
20323: You achieve nothing by this.
20357: Futile.
20369: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
20421: You talk to yourself a while.
20448: This provokes no reaction.
20476: There is no reply.
20495: Nothing is on sale.
20514: Your singing is abominable.
20540: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
20577: Time passes.
20592: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
34626: Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, read the AFTERWORD or
QUIT?
34705: You hesitate.
34800: That mistake cannot be corrected.
34830: You've been trying to do that for a long time, but never seem to come up
with a satisfactory answer.
34906: You want to talk to someone, but they are not here. They never are when
you need them.
34974: Sure, inanimate objects won't interrupt you or try to stop you to force
their stories on you, but they don't understand either.
35069: That sentence was not understood.
35099: That doesn't exist in this small domain.
35158: Notification of the passing of the days is on.
35196: Notification of the passing of the days is off.
35236: You haven't visited anywhere significant.
35273: You cannot run away from yourself.
35303: You feel ill at ease praying to something that is not there.
35353: Yes, no. You say these words with little meaning.
35395: It is far too easy to destroy what has taken so long to create.
35445: Life seems nothing more than a foggy dream, albeit painted more vividly.
Perhaps there is a higher consciousness somewhere to awake into.
35546: Thoughts come slowly, and half-formed.
35580: There is nothing significant to smell in this world.
35622: There is nothing significant to taste in this world.
35664: It seems that you are always listening and never speaking.
35719: Warm skin, like every other body.
35748: It doesn't feel at all unusual.
35779: You are not the kind of person to jump when some people say so. You keep
your feet firmly on the ground.
35857: Does anyone really mean it when they say that? Or are they just
conniving to get themselves out of trouble?
35937: Swearing makes you feel slightly better. But only slightly.
35985: You are unsatisfied by the mildness of your curse.
36026: You can't swim here.
36048: Your new form of greeting friends. But do you look like those people in
gameshows who wave moronically at the end?
36142: You can't manipulate people in that way.
36183: You can't manipulate people like that.
36222: All very meaningless in the long run.
36255: You sing awhile, hoping that the noise coming out is tuneful, suspecting
that it isn't.
36322: That won't achieve anything.
36349: You hesitate.
36365: Sleep is difficult, and comes in broken segments. You are not refreshed.
45220: So tragically easy to do. You are ugly and talentless, selfish and
boring.
45287: That's not appropriate right now.
45320: There is work to be done, and you do it to the best of your abilities.
It is the only thing in which you can take great pleasure and satisfaction.
45433: With no-one else to kiss, you can only kiss yourself.
45492: For once, your sleep is restful and complete, and interlaced with dreams
of unself-conscious sexual attraction. If only the real world was as certain.
45610: The week is over, and another begins. Pain and joy, achievement and
disappointment: themes that run throughout your life, recurring in many forms.
And so it starts again.
45803: The man reacts well. But was that just tolerance and pity, or genuine
feeling?
45868: The man makes all the right noises, sometimes amused, sometimes
interested, sometimes disagreeing with you.
45950: You do not have the motive to strike him.
45998: You give your love to this man in an act that is part courage and part
foolishness. But the man is scared and unsure of your affections, and soon
leaves you.
46112: You are vulnerable, and scared. Why would this man want to have sex with
you of all people? Why would anyone? And soon, thankfully, it is over, and all
you want to do is flee from the abysmal act that has just occurred.
46279: So scared are you of rejection that you reject first, and yet another
chance of happiness leaves as abruptly as it arrived.
46374: There are arguments; of course there are. But you are soon making up,
and grateful for it.
46448: Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn't. It is the best compromise
you could hope for.
46518: Do you love them? How can you be sure?
46563: You've always wondered if there can really be such people as friends.
You have sex with a friend, and it muddies the waters. You never speak properly
to each other again.
46689: It is too frightening to say anything out loud, and so to punish your
friends, you slip away and leave, but they do not notice. As a result, you
become more hurt than them.
46815: You do not strike them, no matter how angry you feel.
46859: You don't need them, you think to yourself. But, after a while, you find
that you miss them and wonder what they are doing.
46952: Somehow, all your friends are suddenly gone.
46998: It is hard to get a word in, be noticed, be listened to. They are not
interested in what you have to say; they care only in telling you their
stories.
47110: Once such an affectionate, special thing, the kiss is now just a
meaningless contact.
47182: To hell with them! You don't need them. Or maybe you do.
47232: They rarely listen, prefering to make the decisions between themselves.
47291: You fail by a whisker. But that is not the end; soon it returns for
another shot.
47364: You pass, but only just. Another hurdle out of the way. You can't help
feeling disappointed with your performance, though; with just a little bit more
effort, you could have done far better.
47505: It is far too great a mass to ignore.
47539: Work takes up time that could be better used, but it must be done.
47591: Work satisfaction is an extremely warm and pleasant feeling.
47639: You try to ignore it, but it returns twice as heavy.
47686: It is already within you.
47710: Why does this always happen? Just when you need to be the most alert,
you find yourself the least able to cope.
47794: It is a warm, sleepy tiredness, the kind that reminds you of dark nights
snuggled in an armchair by a roaring fire.
47880: You attempt to ignore the tiredness, but it does not ignore you back.
47948: You ignore them, and they stay away. What else could you have done but
ignore them?
48014: They are so interesting and so fresh, so real.
48054: They always get in your way, and are only out for themselves.
48104: You want so much to join other people, to fit in, but you don't. You
can't.
48166: Only the old and the desperate show an interest. At first, you take what
you can, but soon your pride tells you to stop. Maybe you should try making a
move yourself - but the fear of rejection is overpowering.
48323: The kisses you give and receive are meaningless, during their rare
occurances.
48383: You do not have the confidence to strike out; neither do you have the
motive.
48448: A few nod and grin meaningfully. You say something ridiculous just to
see how they react. They nod and grin meaningfully. You turn away in disgust.
48566: It feels good to vent the anger you feel, but soon you are back where
you started.
48632: They don't listen. They rarely listen.
48690: They say it's best to just ignore people like this. Reluctantly, you
follow this advise, and swallow your rage. Public anger, after all, would only
upset the others.
48841: You rage against the shadow, but the others turn against you for your
language and bile. Why didn't they share their harsh words with the shadow as
well? Maybe they don't like you. You're not one of them - they only protect
their own.
49007: ka,



A week, much like any other, is about to start. What promises
does it hold? What problems will you face? And how will you feel at the end?
49943: They say that proper love can only come when you learn to love yourself.
You love certain aspects of life, but can't say for sure if you love yourself.
50115: Someone once said it was sex with someone you love. It finishes as
merely satisfactory, fantasy being less exciting but also less frightening than
real life.
50224: But would that be wrong? And why? And why should it matter?
50270: You know you need help, but you don't know how to ask. If you ask for
help, it would be like admitting defeat and failure.
50358: That is not a test in the conventional sense.
50394: That is not a test in the conventional sense.
50430: There is always work to be done.
50458: That's not something you can join.
50518: Your obscenity makes you feel slightly better, but only slightly.
50610: But there is so much work to do, so many years to fill.
50654: You very rarely feel truly alive.
50698: But he is here.
50711: It is a pointless exercise; he doesn't want to be found.
50759: They will always be close by, but not nearly close enough.
50806: There is always work, of sorts.
50836: It is an unrewarding task searching for that. It will find you, if you
are destined to possess it.
50934: You are unable to work up enough enthusiasm.
53472: Score:
53480: Moves:
53488: Time:
53496: You can't go that way.
53596: A mess of confused emotions and thoughts, with the repugnant odour of
unresolved pain seeping out of cracks in the surface. Self-doubt rests heavy in
the air.
53708: A man surprises and secretly delights you with his attentions. Does he
love you? Do you love him?
53780: He is expert at keeping well hidden. Or are you merely poor at looking?
53836: Can you really call these people friends after all? Do they genuinely
like you? Or do they merely humour you, for altruistic reasons of their own?
53940: An examination looms, causing turbulence.
53972: Which examination it is, you are not sure. There are so many, one after
the other, in a never ending circle. You are constantly having to prove
yourself, having to prove your worth.
54100: There is always work to be done.
54124: The events of the week so far have taken their toll; you feel tired and
stressed out.
54184: It is there within your head like a fog bank, killing off
self-confidence and making coherent thoughts difficult.
54264: Other people pass you by, getting on with their own lives.
54308: Some old, some young, some attractive, some not. You want so much to
connect, but somehow don't. It is fear that drives you off.
54404: On your peripheral vision, a shadow lingers and showers you with
insults.
54456: Just words from someone who doesn't know you, but hurtful nevertheless.
