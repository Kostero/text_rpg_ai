38922: Quite.
38948: Violence isn't the answer, you know.

39062: You achieve nothing by this.
39086: No, you can't set that.
39106: No, you can't set that to anything.

39690: No reply.
39766: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
39812: Time passes.
39867: It smells strangely like sugar free Dr. Pepper.
39911: Of course, the whole episode with the aliens and the bottle turns out to
be nothing more than a particularly vivid hallucination. Whatever that guy shot
you up with is pretty potent stuff! The bottle and all its contents are now
nothing but a memory.
40107: Smells very very very lovely.
40152: You smoke the entire joint, inhaling deeply and enjoying the savory
aroma to the max. What a rush! You suddenly notice that you've spent about an
hour staring at your left foot, and your stomach is rattling like a freight
train on an uneven track.
40340: Student Rules & Regulations handbook section 1.3.a says that you are not
allowed to light up in a no-smoking area.
40434: The end of the joint starts to burn. The sweet smell of dope wafts into
your twitching nostrils. You salivate madly - Pavlov would be well pleased.
40544: The joint fizzles into ash.
40570: You grab an elevator and head outside...
40758: is tongue at you and says, "Why didn't you listen to me? I told you not
to hang around your room!"
40961: The note catches easily and, as expected, burns to ashes.
41128: Apart from the startling information that the tray is made of blue
porcelain, you don't discover anything else.
41236: It's not lit.
41259: Ah! That's great, really good. Just enough to give you a nice buzz, too.
And it goes down so smooth...

You notice that you're starting to develop a
case of the munchies.
41396: It's already lit!
41421: Student Rules & Regulations handbook section 1.3.a says you are not
allowed to light up in a non-smoking area.
41513: The roach catches. Smells nice!
41544: The roach fizzles into ash.
41570: After a near-interminable wait in the dingy dorm lobby, an elevator
arrives. You head to your room pronto.
41666: Suddenly, a figure in a long trench coat stumbles out of a nearby bush.
He trips on a tree root and grabs you for support, in the process accidentally
jabbing you with a hypodermic!

"Oops. Sorry, pal!" Before you can react, he
giggles and dashes off!
41861: You're beginning to feel a little bit drugged.
41902: .
A small alien spaceship suddenly materializes out of thin air. Five
greenish blobs with antennae ooze down an exit ramp and drop a shiny bottle at
your feet. After a quick burst of alien gibberish, they roll excitedly back
into the ship, which just as suddenly vanishes.
42098: You skulk out of the dining commons...
42147: lady, always on the lookout for vermin like yourself, jumps up and
screams "NOT SO FAST, BUD." You shrink back in alarm. She smiles cruelly and
demands, "Let's see some ID."
42401: lady snarls at you. "Whatta you, some kinda moron? You already been
processed once. Now beat it before you get it beaten for you!"
42509: lady runs it through the little machine that tells her whether or not
you've been blacklisted. It obviously gives her good news because she nods
towards the south and mutters, "Go ahead, brat."
42646: "And what exactly am I supposed to do with that?"
42708: After an interminable wait, you collect a tray full of unexciting food.
42759: You really don't want to subject yourself to that experience more than
once in a lifetime.
42827: If I could do something like that, do you think I'd waste my time
leading you through a silly adventure game?
42915: Bad idea. You're accustomed to seeing some pretty strange things, but I
think that food just smiled at you.
42992: Plain gray plastic.
43041: In your state of extreme munchiness, you manage to ignore the fact that
this is possibly the most repulsive substance ever to go under the label of
"food" in the history of the world. Well, maybe not that bad, but certainly not
good... As it slides down your throat, you imagine you hear whimpering.
43252: You attempt to spear a mouthful, but the mystery meat dodges your feeble
blow. You're going to have to be a lot more desperate before you'll be able to
eat any of this stuff.
43394: upervisor comes running up and says, "You can't go in there. Off limits
to non-employees!"
43603: He's standing in the corner acting very stoned. Nothing you do seems to
get any response.
43686: Roses" T-Shirt, and slouches a lot.
43732: "Hey dude, rock and roll. Got any smoke? I've been straight for almost
40 minutes now!"
43809: Milton's eyes light up. "Dope is good."
43847: Milton's eyes light up. "For ME? DUUUUDDE!!"
43897: He is a rather spacy individual and fails to register that you've
spoken.
43960: "Not like I don't appreciate this or anything dude, but ain't you got
anything bigger?"
44062: A huge grin spreads over Milton's face. "Righteous!" he exclaims.
Suddenly, he appears worried, and with a sharpness of mind you initially
thought him completely incapable of, he blurts out: "Can't smoke this out here.
I've got it! Let's go into the kitchen, nobody will notice there... One problem
- you're not dressed properly. Wait here."

Milton sneaks off, then quickly
returns with an apron and visor, which he hands to you. You put on the uniform
and follow him into the kitchen... Milton wanders off to get wasted and leaves
you to your own devices.
44474: "Great bone, dude. But I don't have a lighter." He hands it right back
to you with a sad puppy-dog look on his face.
44641: niform. He grabs you by the arm and says "Aha! Just what I've been
looking for! I've got a job for you, pal."

He leads you to a sink next to
which are piled approximately 8 quadrillion plates. You are surprised as he
handcuffs you to the sink.

"Start earning your $3.50 an hour, pal," he laughs
vilely.

When you get off shift a week later, you are picked up by the cops who
have found the address book and want to take you in for a little Nazi-style
interrogation.
45030: That would make a mess and achieve nothing.
45075: The oil soaks into the rust on the grating.
45116: Already done!
45136: You pour the oil on the ground.
45169: There's a small amount of safflower oil left in the bottle.
45212: It's an empty plastic bottle.
45242: You remember the story of your cousin Ralph who tried creating the
world's first milkshake made entirely out of cooking oil. His family managed to
talk him out of it before he actually tried it, but he spent his later years in
an insane asylum somewhere in upstate New York.

As anything, including being
busted by the police for being a no-good drug taking commie scumbag, is better
than winding up in upstate New York, you wisely forgo this serious tactical
error.
45577: It's bolted to the wall.
45618: It's really gross without milk. Actually, it's probably really gross
WITH milk, but that's irrelevant right now. The intense concentration of sugars
and artificial flavorings mixes with the alien chemicals in your bloodstream,
and you suddenly feel yourself moving much faster. Your body cells begin to
resonate on a higher frequency and before you can say "Asmodeus," you are
suddenly teleported onto another plane of being! On this plane, life is wild
and carefree, but you only have a few seconds to enjoy it, because the strange
chemical reaction allowing you to be here wears off quickly.

When you
rematerialize on the earth plane, several months have passed and your body has
found its way into jail...
46134: You hear the distinct sound of something metal sifting its way through
the sugar crunchies.
46197: You hear millions of grams of sugar rattling around in a cardboard box.
46262: You rattle out a whole mess of Satan Crunchies all over you and the
ground. You also dislodge the free prize, which turns out to be a pentacle on a
silver chain!
46375: Nothing happens.
46395: At this point, you would probably expect me to tell you that your
graceless leaping puts your foot through the roof, or you lose your footing and
slide to an ignominious death. Well, forget it. You just jump and land. That's
it.

Kind of a letdown, huh?
46605: The zealot picks the tape up and launches back into an anti-rock tirade
while waving the cassette about madly.
46706: The zealot leaps up and grabs your arm. "Hey buddy, don't leave with my
Barry Manilow tape. I need it to point out the evils of pop music to the rest
of the Lord's flock."
46845: You hadn't noticed it previously, but the Jesus Freak's voice has a
really soothing quality to it... like honey on sugar on treacle. You start to
smile vacuously and think to yourself that maybe God isn't such a bad guy after
all... The Jesus Freak smiles knowingly at you and has you whisked off to a
religious retreat, where your head is shaved and you are rechristened "Mother
Shabooboo." 

Unfortunately, even this extreme treatment isn't sufficient to
hide you from the police, who come to collect you after having located the
incriminating address book.
47260: The zealot says, "Please don't take those. I need them for my Sacred
Mission." You swear you can hear the capital letters in his voice.
47464: hhnshouts "Praise the Lord! Another sinner has come to seek salvation!"
47687: The religious zealout looks up at you and smiles beatifically at you. He
begins to preach about the wonders of Christ, Lord. There's something very
insinuating about his mode of speech.
47835: He nods a gracious thanks.
47866: He seems oddly reluctant to talk to you.
47922: The zealot looks excited - you are the first person in days to talk to
him. "Ah yes, that there's a tape of the demonaic Barry Manilow, whose songs
are scientifically proven to cause cancer, herpes, gangrene, and halitosis in
all rational creatures. Would you like to take a closer look at it?" As he
hands it to you, you realize that you may have more in common with the zealot
than you'd like to admit. He begins to preach loudly and monotonously about the
evils of rock and roll.
48264: The zealot says, "I've already told you everything I know." You are
inclined to take him quite literally.
48343: "I have no idea."
48379: The zealot's eyes light on the devil's insignia and begin to glaze over.
He starts to froth at the mouth and scream incoherent nonsense (although the
difference is not immediately apparent). Making the sign of the cross, he backs
away from you and runs off to parts unknown.
48573: He's not interested.
48645: The walkman's compartment only accepts tape cassettes.
48736: You hear nothing.
48760: You hear Kate Bush singing "Sat In Your Lap."
48807: You hear Barry Manilow singing "I Write The Songs."
48850: You don't hear anything.
48931: Music dribbles tinnily out of the headphones.
48964: The walkman's motor whirrs to life.
48996: You jab the stop button and the Walkman obediently grinds to a halt.
49119: You might as well try to wake the dead.
49158: She's fast asleep and doesn't hear you.
49199: The wood is light, but the damned thing is about five feet deep. In
other words: why bother?
49271: Why bother? It's not lost!
49344: Already done!
49358: You open the umbrella.
49388: You close the umbrella.
49407: It's not open!
49443: The visual stimulation of all the flashing lights and computer graphics
is too much for your drug-addled brain. You retreat in horror, as intense
hallucinations bombard your distressed visual cortex.
49601: The bleeping and pinging of the machines is subtle at first, but in your
altered state, the compounding of millions of sound effects becomes a din so
tremendous that your brain threatens to explode. You retreat...
49758: Wearing the walkman is effective in blocking out the sounds of the
arcade, but Kate Bush is, of course, the most amazing vocalist and songwriter
in the world. Unfortunately, her music is just too much and you wind up
listening to it, rather than concentrating on mundane activities like walking.
To sum it up, you walk into a wall, rather than the arcade.
50007: With the sunglasses blocking out the visual portion, and the bland
sounds of Barry Manilow muting the sound effects, you are able to stand in the
arcade without freaking out due to overstimulation.
50155: Not bloody likely.
50180: It looks like it could be pulled out, but the edges have rusted.
50235: With much puffing and exertion, you manage to ease up one end of the
grate.
50299: You hear the murmurings of workmen somewhere in the drain.
50355: The tool chest is bulky and prevents you from getting a reasonable grip
on the slimy stone rungs of the ladder.
50432: You clamber up the ladder and emerge from the hole to the curious stares
of passers-by.
50511: A few bricks bounce harmlessly off your umbrella.
50554: A few bricks fall in your path. You are not terribly worried about this
until one particularly large and pointed one falls straight on top of you,
boring through your skull and body. In the instant before you die, you are
comforted by the thought that ignorance is indeed bliss.
50777: The machine seems satisfied and prints "THOTH PREFACE" on the display.
The book comes tumbling out a hidden chute and lands in a heap on the floor.
50888: The machine buzzes angrily and prints "INSERT ID" on the screen.
50941: The machine bleeps unhappily and prints "NO DATA" on the screen.
51004: Don't be ridiculous!
51041: The leather smells terrible, but the paper burns to ashes. The
fundamentalists would be proud of you.
51119: It's not one of those books with a hidden compartment, if that's what
you're thinking.
51192: You attempt to focus on the page but the drug is wreaking havoc on your
optic system. It might as well be Chinese for all the sense you can make of it.
51297: It's actually a pretty dull book and you don't have time to waste
reading it right now.
51365: You turn the book over and shake it. Disappointingly, nothing falls out.
51427: You rifle the pages, noting the copyright page, table of contents,
preface, forward and so forth.
51509: You'll have to specify exactly which page you want to tear.
51557: The pages are firmly bound into the book.
51605: Seems like a waste of time to do it again.
51647: You notice some of the ink rubbing off on your hands.
51695: You rip the page out of the book. Upon closer inspection, you notice
that it's really a sheet of acid, with the preface printed on top.
51797: It's firmly bound into the book.
51891: accidentally got some into his system through a tiny cut in his hand?
Well, surprise surprise, you're about to make history yourself.

A small
unicorn about waist high appears and starts to lick your hand. You enjoy this
up until the point where he suddenly sprouts vicious fangs and chomps your hand
right off! You wave the bloody stump about, screaming, until a friendly officer
arrives to take you away. Bad trip, man.
52198: You really like to walk into these situations, don't you? I could
provide a really long description of how after 30 minutes you began to feel
your brain sailing on a lysergic breeze to another dimension where sentient
barnacles adhered to your body and told you the secrets of the universe, after
which experience you woke up to find yourself in jail, but I'm not going to.
Instead, I'll merely say that...
52488: Oddly, you find that when it comes time to do the deed, you are unable
to steady your grip on the lighter enough to actually incinerate the page.
You'll have to find another way.
52625: You attempt to get into the office but a burly jock grabs you and stuffs
you at the end of the line. He glares, but doesn't say anything, probably
because he doesn't know how yet.
52766: If you join up right now, you might just get in the office by the
dawning of the new millenia. I don't think the cops are going to give you that
long, however.
52882: The sign hangs on the wall, with a pivot point in the middle. It reads:
BURSAR'S OFFICE
52995: It's nailed to the wall.
53036: You deftly snap the sign around so it's pointing in the opposite
direction. The reaction happens slowly but surely... The crowd notices that
they've been waiting in the wrong line! A few brave souls get in line in
another room, and soon there is a stampede for the other end of the hall!
53237: Why bother? It's served its purpose.
53285: As you enter, the gentleman behind the desk smiles and says, "Howdy,
what can I do for you?"
53370: Bob notices that the sticker is expired and turns pale. "Tell ya what,
friend..." he gulps, "You caught me on a good day, so just put that sucker away
and I'll pretend I never saw it."
53516: Bob gasps. "Stow that gear! You're lucky I don't turn you in right now.
You could cost me my job!"
53598: Bob chuckles. "Yeah, I remember my carefree youth."

His eyes glaze over
as he recalls his childhood.
53691: Bob smiles politely at you. "Heck of a day, eh pardner?"
53746: Bob exhales and the scent of garlic nearly knocks you off your feet.
"Here ya go, pal. Have a nice day."

He hands you the form.
53848: "No problem. Just give me your name and I'll get you the form."
53904: Bob looks shocked, as if English is a foreign language to him.
53949: "Sorry, I'm not quite with you, pardner."
53989: Campus regulations prohibit workers from responding to instructions in
that manner.
54064: "Yup, we got one of them. Just give me your name and I'll get you the
form."
54252: 93525 that if it's so important, he can come ask me in person!"

He
slams the phone down, readjusts his smile (which has dropped a bit) and says,
"Sorry about that, pal. Now, what were you wanting?"
54413: In a wonderful gesture of symbolic defiance, you throw the form on the
ground while it burns, and shout out anti-bureaucratic slogans. Long live the
hippy spirit. A passing wymmyn's libber throws a bra onto the flame and helps
you stomp it into ashes.
54590: The steel door locks behind you.
54739: The pliers grab the quarter and it falls to the floor with a satisfying
metallic clink.
54800: It won't fit in the coin slot.
54836: Your fingers are too fat to reach into the slot.
54879: It is almost unbearably bitter, but you choke it down nonetheless.
54979: It burns slightly on the way down. After a few moments of
disorientation, you begin to feel the effects of the strange chemical in your
bloodstream lessening! In fact, you're just about as close to normal as you'll
ever be.
55141: You stumble for support... The antidote and the hallucinogenic agent are
having a small skirmish inside your brain. Unfortunately, it appears that the
hallucinogen is winning because you suddenly notice 17 lobsters in French
Legion uniforms waving their antennae accusingly at you.
55347: The vial contained only a single dose.
55378: A steel door at the bottom of the stairs swings shut behind you and
locks with a soft click.
55451: Just use the machines.
55487: You perform the transaction, and retrieve a copy of the school paper.
55548: Unfortunately, it has no bill slot, and you have nothing smaller than a
$10 anyway.
55621: The machine swallows the quarter and makes a reassuring mechanical
clicking noise. Press one of the selection buttons now, I guess.
55728: Nothing happens.
55751: The drinks dispenser drops a cup into its chute and a concealed nozzle
quickly fills the cup with thin liquid.
55839: Worse things happen at sea, so they say.
55875: I don't think that's such a great idea - you could conceivably be
arrested for dumping toxic waste.
55959: For vending machine tea, it's surprisingly good, which only means that
it doesn't kill you instantly.
56039: You spill a little on your shoes but are relieved to find that the tea
does not eat through them, sparing your toes a no doubt grisly fate.

You toss
the cup in a nearby trash basket.
56175: It smells like burning rubber with a bit of cream and sugar added.
56393: Your caffeine buzz is wearing off.
56427: Greg giggles and fondles the desk.
56463: "Sorry bud, afraid I don't quite follow you."
56505: "Can't do that, I'm busy at the moment."
56548: Rothman raises an eyebrow. "What's that you got there, partner?
Vitamins? I've always been big on them myself. At least ever since I found out
Arnold Schwarzenegger recommended them to President Bush before he joined the
President's Council on Fitness."

Displaying superhuman effort, you politely
stifle a yawn.
56784: You realize that Rothman is the type who would turn in his own mother
for such a heinous crime and stop before making a terrible mistake.
56891: "I'm just using this to weigh some pamphlets for our next Young
Republican Club mailout. When I'm done, I'm gonna hand it in to the cops so
they can bust the little stinker who used it for nefarious drug-taking
purposes."
57050: Greg is too busy doing his mailout to take any notice of you.
57111: Rothman looks at the gelatin capsule. "Oh boy! Vitamins! Gotta keep up
the strength if we're to keep America american!" He pops the capsule and sighs
contentedly.
57251: As soon as his now-overly-sensitized flesh comes into contact with the
plush teddy, an inane smile breaks out on Rothman's face. The effect is
extremely unsettling.

In a giggly blissed out voice, he tells you, "Oh, gosh,
you're so nice!! Gee, I don't know what I could possibly ever do to repay you
for being such a nice person. Oh here, why don't you take this scale?  I guess
I don't really need to mail out these propaganda booklets. Politics is such a
bore. I'd much rather go out and play with flowers!" (As he chatters on, you
realize that you preferred him when he was a grumpy, uptight Republican.)

You
take the scale and leave Rothman to fondle the teddy bear.
57741: A happy grin breaks out on M. Greg's face. He starts to giggle
uncontrollably and fondle the desk. "Wow! Real Plywood!"
57845: You are ordinarily quite distrustful of cops. Add this normal level of
background paranoia to the massive blob of drug-induced paranoia currently
making its home in your frontal lobes and you've got a recipe for instant
disaster. Not wanting to be immediately arrested, you wisely back off.
58073: You are feeling calm enough to walk past the police. Unfortunately, you
are obviously not feeling smart enough to conceal the incriminating items that
you are carrying in plain view. Pigs may be slow, but they're not fools.
Suffice to say that your indiscretion is duly noted and your arrest is swift
and unpleasant.
58292: The cops are making you sweat a little, but you are able to slouch by in
a sufficiently relaxed manner. One or two cops glance at you quickly,  but
don't see anything odd enough to rouse them out of their routine.
58465: You notice a small mound of dirt under a shrub, with a toothpick stuck
in it. Knowing that this is a favorite trick of Keith's, you do a little
experimental digging and unearth the incriminating address book!
58619: The cigarette lighter doesn't have enough power to torch the book.
You'll have to find another way.
58744: Keith's arrest - apparently it's one of their bigger scores of late.
58910: gxndonuts. Something about law enforcement as well, but mainly donuts.
58964: bhnthe latest "Lethal Weapon" film.
58998: As you climb the stairs up to the lobby, a squad of policemen burst
through the front door. You attempt to dodge, but it's too late - they've seen
you!

"Grab the little punk!" one of them says.

They eye you with the detached
interest of a dog contemplating a bone. "Tampering with evidence, I bet," the
chief inspector says viciously.

You are manhandled into the back of a van, and
whisked away to the station.
59334: You are taken to a holding cell, where you remain for several hours.
During this time, the strange chemical in your body wears off. Not long after
this, some policemen enter the cell. One says, "I don't know how you did it,
you little rat, but we've got nothing on you, and we can't hold you any
longer." He spits out the words distastefully: "You're free to go."

After
having your possessions returned, you step out into the clear air of another
crisp New England fall day to find Keith waiting for you in his beat-up Ford.
"Dude! Am I ever glad to see you! My lawyer got me probation, so I'm clear for
now."

You smile in relief.

Keith grins wickedly. "So, you wanna go smoke a
fatty?"
59842: After fingerprinting, mugshots, and a rather embarrassing piss test, you
are escorted to a cell. Several hours later, some officers enter, smiling
gleefully. "Looks like you didn't do such a great job, buddy. We found plenty
of incriminating evidence scattered around that campus - enough to put you away
for quite a while, anyway. Incidentally, what on earth is that stuff in your
blood? Our lab guys have never seen anything like it! Don't you have any
respect for your body? Damned kids!"
60199: In your inebriated condition, you imagine there to be a huge wall of
fire blocking your path. Not wishing to become a human bar-b-que, you cease
your northwards progress.
60441: "You're not getting anything without a prescription."
60482: The pharmacist is busy with her Physicians Desk Reference (circling
prescription remedies she means to purloin for her friends) and ignores your
request.
60603: She yawns. "Wow, never seen one of those before."
60649: Her eyes light up. "Are you selling!?"
60685: She frowns at it. "Never seen anything like that."
60738: The pharmacist yawns and tells you: "Valium is the trade name of
diazepam, an anti-anxiety medicine developed and sold by the Eli Lilly
corporation. It is highly addictive. Happy?"
60869: "I'm sure I don't know anything about that."
60924: The pharmacist looks at the slip, sighs a bored sigh and comes back with
a small paper packet which she hands to you.
61026: You pop the pills and soon begin to feel much more relaxed.
61077: Your diazepam-induced tranquility is fading fast.
61123: The door will not open.
61163: Good idea. That's what you do when you're in a waiting room, right? Very
soon after adopting your best
slouching-in-the-chair-hoping-someone-will-notice-you posture, a nurse comes
scuttling over. She makes you fill in a few forms and then announces, "Doctor
Floyd will see you now."
61374: Doctor Floyd calls after you: "Hey, shut the door on your way out, OK
sport?"
61443: I don't suppose Dr. Floyd would care for that.
61622: :nasks, "Can I help you?"
61648: ixntouches the end of his stethoscope with his finger. "Yeeeow! That's
cold."
61710: chnsays, "What can I do for you, sport?"
61762: Dr. Floyd says, "What can I do for you, pal?"
61813: Floyd waves it away. "Yeeow, that's some concentrated stuff you got
there. I wouldn't go fooling with it if I were you."
61907: The Doctor dips his finger into it and has a quick, experimental taste.
"Hmmm. Never seen anything like it."
61996: Floyd whistles. "Well, my professional medical opinion is that that
stuff is bad news, but between you and me, I've always thought the dangers were
overrated. Now put it away before someone less open-minded walks in!"
62171: Dr. Floyd says, "You've already been checked out, now get out of here.
Nurse! Escort this pest out, please." The nurse enters and hustles you back to
the waiting room.
62322: The doctor performs a few perfunctory examinations, some of which are
best left undescribed. He eventually gets around to checking your heart rate
and blood pressure at which points he exclaims, "Yow, a highly elevated pulse!
Tell ya what, sport - get this prescription filled, and take two any time you
feel stressed out."

He quickly scribbles off a prescription and hands it to
you.
62593: The doctor performs a quick series of tests and says, "You seem fine to
me. Well, your pupils are a little large, but I expect that's from studying too
hard, eh sport? Heh heh... Nurse, send in the next patient, please!"
62756: The doctor is busy reading a medical journal and fails to notice that
you've spoken.
62825: You destroy the prescription.
62867: The button lights up but immediately goes out again.
62920: The doors slam shut, the elevator moves with a whoosh that
simultaneously puts your stomach in your brain and your teeth in your shoes.
The door whips open again, almost throwing you out.
63059: You'll have to be more specific.
63100: "Hi! I'm a perky but annoying hotel worker. What can I do to complicate
your day?"
63163: She says, "I'd love to help you, but I can't while I'm on shift."
63230: She sneers. "Yeah, we got a room for you. The rates are $50 per night
for non-students, but only $30 for students. I'll need some ID before I can
give you the student rate, of course."
63373: "They didn't tell me anything about that in job training."
63622: 97. Bring it back with the money, and then I'll give you the room."
63699: She looks at it and says, "OK. I guess I have no choice." She grabs the
$30 from you and glumly hands you the hotel room key.
63796: She looks at the form. "OK. So where's the cash? Get out of here, you
deadbeat!!"
63882: "The non-student rate for a room is $50. You're $20 short, buster!"
63941: She rolls her eyes in boredom.
63974: You take a look at the key, stride purposefully towards the correct
room, and unlock the door...
64048: There's no point, you couldn't get into any of the rooms now anyway.
64102: You head back to the elevator lobby.
64154: This is a nice safe place to recover your strength. After a few hours of
some really serious shuteye, you awake feeling much refreshed, although the
hallucinogenic chemical in your bloodstream is still nagging at the back of
your brain.
64330: You are completely exhausted - so exhausted that you pass out right
where you are. As you might expect, lying on the ground looking like a homeless
person and occasionally twitching is a good way to get noticed by the police...
64494: You're starting to feel quite tired. You'd better find somewhere to
sleep soon.
64560: You are beginning to feel sleepy.
64592: If you don't find somewhere suitable to sleep soon, you're going to
regret it.
64656: I mean it! You have GOT to sleep, or I won't be held accountable for the
results!
64764: You really needed food very very badly. Due to the fact that you've been
subsisting on nothing but Coke and Twinkies for the past week, you pass out.
When you wake up, a week has passed and Keith has stood his trial. The cops
found your name in the address book and picked you up. In fact, you notice that
you've woken up in a cell. Well, at least there's food here...
65034: Your stomach is growling very loudly. You should probably try to get
some food into it soon.
65103: fkka.
Suddenly your girlfriend Sydnee comes
65158: Hmbarging up to you.
65175: "You bastard!" she screams, "I'm through with you and your
flakiness!"

Before you can ameliorate her, she flings the teddy bear you gave
her for your two-week anniversary at you and says, "You can keep your stupid
bear, asshole!"

She
65437: 8sfkpa.

It's late in the day, classes were hellish, and the last thing
you need is to come home and hear
65527: on your answering machine:

"Hey man, it's Keith. The pigs finally got
me, and if they ever manage to find my address book, they'll probably be coming
for you too. I can't tell you where I've hidden it, for obvious reasons, but if
I were you I'd try to find it first, along with any other questionable items
you may have "lost." By the way, I wouldn't hang around your room too much -
that's the first place they look for you... Damn! Time's up, I gotta go... good
luck!"
65903: You have been busted!
66362: I think it's more likely that you've already suffered smoke inhalation
to make a suggestion like that.
66456: That makes no sense at all.
66478: Sorry, I have no idea what that means.
66510: Sorry, but unlike your uncouth self, I have an inbuilt resistance to
senseless vandalism.
66591: With what, your brilliant personality?
66646: A good try, but it doesn't work.
66689: This doesn't seem like a safe place.
66716: You aren't tired right now.
66900: Psychedelic Interactive Fiction (not to be taken internally)

67016: You can't go that way.
67084: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
67116: As good-looking as ever.
67136: You gave this cuddly little fellow to Sydnee, who apparently doesn't
want it reminding her of you any more.
67212: It lists your room number and also guarantees return postage.
67256: The bottle is labeled "Magic Anti-Hallucination Elixir."
67304: It's a small burgundy visor, bearing the legend "WORCESTER DINING
COMMONS." Several unidentifiable bits of food are stuck to the band.
67420: Fortunately, it does not say "Kiss The Cook," but that's pretty much its
only good point.
67488: You are in your dorm room, in Linnell House. It is bigger than a
breadbox, but not by much. The door is to the north.
67576: The only door is to the north.
67606: It's got you on it, looking very confused, and a bunch of numbers. Your
student identification number is A2487493. Unfortunately, it is out of date, as
the sticker on it says it expired last semester.
67774: L.
67784: Sitting on the dorm table is a small ashtray.
67816: You have unearthed a small roach.
67840: Not the insect kind. It's what's left over from last night's binge.
67892: The diligently landscaped area outside of your dorm contains a few
anorexic shrubs and some wild crabgrass. To the south is the red brick hell you
call home. A muddy path leads north.
68020: You're on a path outside of the white stone building (to the west) which
serves as the dining commons for this area. You are not surprised to notice a
large "biohazard" sign on the building. The squat structure of your dorm is
visible off to the south, and the path leads east as well.
68220: It smells like a rubbish tip in here - and only a bit less appetizing.
The grubby linoleum leads south to the main atrium and back out to the east.
68324: A Dining Commons line lady sits here on her stool, chewing gum and
making occasional rude sucking noises with it.
68404: Fat, dumpy and quintessentially unloveable, the dining commons lady is a
typical bureaucrat in every important respect. Like all bureaucrats, she exists
purely to complicate your existence.
68760: , despite all logic, calls "food."
68788: It's long, but you've seen worse. If I were in a philosophical mood I'd
question whether the wait is worth it.
68868: Cheap formica tables, uncomfortable chairs... What else do you expect
from a cafeteria? Whatever it is, you won't find it here. The linoleum path
cuts diagonally through the room, leading northeast to the atrium and southeast
to the dish room.
69040: Stuck into the floor is a hardwood table.
69072: It smells like an airport lounge, only worse. However, given the caliber
of the cooking in this place, it could be a lot worse. You can bring your dirty
plates to the dish room to the southwest, or head back out, to the northwest.
69388: proper by going northeast or northwest. The kitchen is to the west, but
a sign over the door cautions "Authorized Personnel Only"
69480: They cook here, but only a far more generous soul would call it food.
The smell is almost overwhelming. A small closet is north, and you can go back
to the dish room east.
69600: Someone has left a bottle of cooking oil out on a counter.
69652: You are standing in a rather cramped closet filled with enough sugared
cereal to rot holes in every tooth on the entire campus - and that's a lot of
teeth. A sturdy metal ladder leads up, and the kitchen is south.
69800: A ladder runs from the floor through a skylight in the ceiling.
69844: There is a picture of a grinning demon, clutching a bowl full of
sickly-sweet cereal, and the following copy: "Satan's Sugar Frosted Crunchies!
A delicious, demonic new cereal! Be the darling of major occult churches, and
stoke up your hellfire with Satan Crunchies: a guaranteed summons in every
box!!

(We're Beatrice.)"
70080: It's what you'd expect: a five cornered star inside a circle, made out
of some silvery metal. The pendant is on a leather thong so you can easily wear
it.
70188: Up on a slate roof with an unspectacular view of the campus, which, from
this vantage point, rather resembles a sty, what with the muddy paths, wooden
fences, and all. It's actually not in such bad shape right now, given that most
of the little oinkers are home on holiday. The top of a ladder leads down back
into the closet.
70416: Although you normally enjoy being high, this time it's giving you
vertigo.
70468: A water pipe used for smoking tobacco and other herbal substances.

Your
name and address are burned into the glass. Obviously this belongs to you, but
you have no clue how it found its way to the roof of the cafeteria! Presumably
it was left behind after a particularly lengthy session with Milton. Now that
you've found it, you'd better find a way to get rid of it again before the cops
find it!
70744: A cute little glass bong is here.
70768: You're plodding noisily along a muddy east-west path. Offensive
squelching noises accompany each footstep. Some grey and scraggly trees
punctuate the sides in a half-hearted attempt to make this industrial nightmare
look slightly more natural.
70936: The campus center is a bizarre building, looking somewhat like a giant
Belgian waffle perched precariously on large concrete pillars. Going east will
take you inside this complex, and the path remains to the west.
71084: A long stretch of flagstone paved floor leads off to the east. A sign
indicates the music and reading room to the south. The door through which you
entered is west.
71200: A long stretch of flagstone paved floor runs both east and west. There
are usually many tables filled with ideological zealots hawking a new religion
or ski club or CIA recruitment plan, but right now there is one lone Jesus
Freak table, and it's to the north. Off to the south is the information desk
and lost and found area.
71428: You're at a T-intersection. The concourse runs east-west, with a branch
to the north. The grey flagstone is as uninspiring here as it is everywhere
else.
71540: There is an expensive pair of Vuarnet sunglasses here.
71580: You are at a large table dotted with colourful pamphlets and covered by
a felt sign that sums up the belief system of this particular cult with
admirable brevity: "Jesus is Lord". The concourse passes by to the south.
71736: The usual "It's Not Cool To Burn In Hell" kind of stuff, suckering the
unwary into a life devoted to praising Jesus and fattening the wallets of savvy
businessmen.
71856: A pimply, straggly haired Jesus Freak, his face beaming with the inane
smile of the truly stupid mans the table, passing out pamphlets and shouting
"Jesus loves you!" at unsuspecting passers-by.
71996: By the glazed look in his eye, you can tell that he's been brainwashed
by some insidious mind-control cult. Currently, he's waving a Barry Manilow
tape and shouting out anti-rock-and-roll slogans.
72136: The writing on the shell informs you that it contains "Barry Manilow's
Greatest Hits." You imagine it must be rather short.
72228: Although this place is usually full of bookish types in full-on study
mode, the room is strangely deserted right now. The large (soundproof) glass
doors are north.
72344: You spot a rather valuable Sony walkman lying on a table.
72384: It's got all those wonderful modern features - Dolby noise reduction,
UltraThump bass, etcetera.
72456: Lucky find! It's her best album, "The Dreaming."
72496: A giant map of campus, a marble desk, and a lost and found box: these
are the joys of the information desk. The equal thrill of the concourse can be
found to the north.
72620: A young woman, presumably the information desk receptionist, lies
slumped over the cool marble, apparently asleep.
72700: She's fast asleep.
72716: There's a brass plaque embedded in the desk.
72748: Some incredibly witty rogue has whited out everything on the map except
for a small dot above the legend "You Are Here."
72836: "This reality was designed by Jon Drukman and Derek Pizzuto, with some
assistance late in the day from Mike Wertheim. It was assembled from finest
quality hand-tooled bits by faceless drones of the Scumbag Software
Corporation, all working for minimum wage."
73024: Elevators usually arrive here, but, like everything, it's a bit of a
crap shoot. Only one is currently working, and it is sitting here with its
doors open waiting to take some unsuspecting dupe to the floor of their choice.
The concourse is south.
73200: There is an elevator waiting here, its doors open.
73236: This is the eastern end of the concourse. From the north comes
futuristic sounds and many flashing lights. A door to the east leads outside.
73336: You are standing on a path east of the campus center. From the north you
hear the quacks of ducks at the campus pond.
73420: A large grate in the ground belches an unpleasant-smelling cloud of
steam into the air.
73480: A large grate has been moved aside, allowing access to the storm drain
below.
73536: You've clambered down a ladder to a rather slimy ledge, and are now up
to your ankles in brackish water. The water swirls around and through the drain
to the southwest.
73652: You take an experimental step off the ledge and find that the water
quickly becomes far deeper than you feel comfortable with.
73740: Lying in a small alcove is a metal tool chest.
73772: A pair of needle-nose pliers, with a blue rubber handgrip.
73816: This is the pond, crossroads of the campus. Famed for its man-made
beauty and the indigenous strain of ducks which is unbelievably resistant to
ordinary pollutants. They also manage to subsist almost entirely on a diet of
stale bread and popcorn, a mystery which has fascinated many of the country's
eminent zoologists. To the north is the much-reviled Whitmore Administration
Building. The country's tallest public library can be found to the east. A busy
street is west of here, and the Campus Center is gleaming dully off to the
south.
74192: The library is a masterpiece of engineering. Standing twenty-six stories
tall, it is the tallest public library in the country. Unfortunately, due to a
spectacular oversight, the builders neglected to take into account the weight
of a million books, and the building is sinking into the ground slowly but
surely. Also, bricks keep falling off of it. The entrance is east, and the
quacks of ducks can be heard to the west.
74484: The lobby here is made of cool marble. Signs point out the Card Catalog
room to the north and the exit to the west.
74568: Most of the typical card catalog files have been replaced by modern
computer equipment in an attempt to make life much more convenient for the
students. Someone neglected to tell the planners that index cards aren't
subject to power failures or disk crashes, however.
74756: There is a small computer terminal here, hooked up to the library
database.
74808: Due to a rash of book thefts, the library management have installed a
computer which is hooked up to the stacks. All you have to do is type the
nine-character access code of the book you want, and it will be delivered to
you. There is also a small slot in the front of the computer.
75004: It looks like it could accept something about the size of a credit card.
75056: It's called "Thoth," author: Aleister Crowley. A quick scan of the
contents reveal it to be full of all sorts of useful information concerning
drugs, the devil, and occultism.
75188: Pages are what one often finds in books.
75304: It's got a nifty design of unicorns, dragons and rainbows all over. You
also notice your name and address stamped on the back. Damn your possessive
ways!
75412: Imagine all the worst bureaucratic excesses you can, multiply by ten,
and'll you have a fair idea of the thievery and ineptitude that rules in the
Whitmore Administration Building, possibly the most loathed structure on the
entire campus. If you dare, you can enter to the north, or retreat to the
pastoral grace of the pond south.
75644: You're in the dungeon of doom. There aren't any skeletons chained to the
walls, but I suspect that's because the janitors just finished cleaning this
area a few minutes ago. Unsettling moans of pain and the sound of cash
registers indicate that the Bursar's office is west. You may wimp out to the
south.
75860: There is an enormous crowd of people here, all waiting in line to get to
the Bursar's office. If you wait in this line, I estimate that it will take 7
years to get to the front.
75988: You know how some lines are fun to wait in, where there's a sense of
camaraderie and shared experience against a hostile "them"? This isn't one of
them. The people in it are hostile at the best of times. This is clearly not
even close to being the best of times, so their usual hostility has morphed
into spectacularly unusual hostility.
76224: There is a sign here.
76240: The castle treasury! Many students have found out the hard way that the
administration can take an infinite amount without giving away one penny. You
may effect your escape to the east.
76368: A neanderthal bureaucrat (name tag: "Bob.") stands here waiting to make
your life more of a living hell than it already is.
76456: He's actually reasonably friendly-looking - his name tag has a smiley
face drawn in the "o" in "Bob." It also has a string of digits under the name.
76564: It's fairly uninteresting bureacratese. The gist of it is that it
entitles the bearer to one night in a campus hotel room for $30.
76660: Addicted youth stand around video and pinball machines, wiggling their
bodies lewdly, occasionally shouting incomprehensible phrases like "Go fer the
hill!" and "Lionman!" The concourse is back to the south, and light from the
Student Union filters in through a window in a steel door to the east.
76872: One pinball machine catches your eye.
76900: One quarter of a US dollar. Round, with milled edges and an engraved
picture of George Washington. Oh yeah, and it says "In God We Trust" on it. How
much detail do you want, anyway? It's just a quarter!
77056: MDMA, also known as ecstasy - the wonder drug that can turn the
grouchiest person in the world into a sickening ball of happiness and goodwill.
I'm not too fond of the stuff, personally.
77188: It's sort of pearly white with glittery bits in it.
77228: Lots of interesting things happen here: crowds rally and riot for their
ideals, heated intellectual debates are fought and won, ideas are sociably
interchanged... but mainly a lot of people stand around staring at the
television sets mounted in the walls. There is a small alcove to the east and a
set of scuffed stairs leads up and down.
77460: The door is locked.
77476: This is nothing more than a small recessed area with a meager selection
of vending machines: newspaper and drinks only, really. You can return west to
the Student Union proper.
77600: Squat and rusting through the bright yellow paint, it claims to offer
the Daily Collegian for a quarter.
77676: Tall and covered with a fake wood design that puts you in mind of cheap
recreation rooms in suburban tract housing. It claims to offer tea, coffee and
chicken soup for a quarter.
77800: The headline reads "Tuition Hike Imminent" and goes on to detail how
lack of state funding threatens to nearly double the tuition bill next
semester. You also encounter an article about the new zero tolerance for drugs
initiatives, which hopefully snaps your mind right back to your current
predicament.
78012: Sitting in the vending machine's dispensing slot is a cup of chicken
noodle soup.
78068: Sort of yellowish, with gray bits of meat, and noodles that have
definitely seen better days.
78136: Sitting in the vending machine's dispensing slot is a cup of tea.
78184: Personally, I like it with lemon and milk, but whoever designed the
drinks machine didn't agree. Suffice to say that a real tea drinker would be
appalled.
78292: Sitting in the vending machine's dispensing slot is a cup of coffee.
78340: It's a styrofoam cup of brownish coffee, although it looks more like a
styrofoam cup of brownish industrial drain opener.
78424: This is a long and broad staircase which leads to the RSO offices. It,
like most staircases, leads up and down.
78504: The offices of many diverse student groups litter this corridor, in both
the literal and figurative senses. There is a staircase at the south end of the
hall. There are no lights on in any of the offices, except for one which is to
the north.
78672: All the office doors in that direction are locked.
78792: literature scattered on a table, "Come Back George - All Is Forgiven"
bumper stickers and other offensive paraphernalia.
79020: For one thing, he's an obnoxious bastard. Also, he's clearly upset -
probably about the Democrats being back in power. But then again, what do you
expect from a Republican? Currently, he's fingering a small postal scale that
looks suspiciously like scales used for measuring bags of marijuana. His intent
is more political, as he is weighing propaganda booklets for mailing.
79284: Your initials and student ID are engraved into the metal. Although it
seemed like a good idea at the time, you realize that perhaps discretion would
have been smarter. Live and learn.
79412: A small metal scale, used for weighing letters usually, although also
used for drugs at times, is here.
79484: This is the main road through campus. The pond lies east, and a modern
looking building sits on the west side of the road. University Ave splits off
here to the north.
79604: This is a smaller thoroughfare that winds its away around campus.
Unfortunately, you're not going to be able to do a whole lot of winding with it
because there is a police roadblock set up to the north. You can return to
Pleasant Street to the south.
79848: and looks ridiculously dated now). You notice entirely too much brown
mahogany trim, some more of that pathetic shubbery, and a door leading in to
the east.
79956: It contains a few addresses of Keith's regular customers. Your name is
prominent among them.
80024: The incriminating address book is here!
80052: The lobby is an airy and open space, dominated by a grand spiral
staircase, which leads up and down. You can see a continuous hustle of activity
happening above - cops are moving around and conversing at the top of the
stairs.
80208: I won't allow you to walk straight into the arms of the law.
80252: This is a sooty, smelly basement. Damp patches of mildew shine on the
wall, reflecting the light of a naked, grime-coated, 60-watt bulb. A large
trash incinerator is visible at the north end of the basement, about 50 feet
away.
80416: This small corner of the basement is even grimier and smellier than the
previous bit. At least it is warm and dry, mainly due to the presence of a huge
trash incinerator.
80536: Orange flames leap around in the interior, making you sweat.
80580: You are standing outside the University Health Center which serves the
Five College area residents, students and non-students alike. You can enter to
the west, or head east, back out to Pleasant Street.
80728: The lobby is a functional area (read: dead boring), featuring a glass
case filled with "Safe Sex" informational displays. Signs point out the
convenient pharmacy to the west, the comfortable waiting room to the north, and
the inviting exit to the east.
80908: The pharmacy area is predominantly populated by students waiting for
diet pills, birth control pills, or tranquilizers (which they will take when
either of the first two fail). A sign points out the beautifully manicured
lobby to the east.
81080: A white-smocked pharmacist stands behind the window, waiting to help
you.
81136: Just two pills in a paper packet.
81160: They've really got it all here - old magazines, hardwood chairs, boring
safe sex pamphlets, you name it. They've also got a sign pointing west to the
skilled Doctor's office, and the refreshingly oxygen-rich lobby to the south.
81434: floyd's degree is on the wall, and you also spot a jar of tongue
depressors, some rubber gloves, lubricants, etc. You can get out to the east,
if you run.
81544: It says that Dr. Floyd graduated from the School Of Hard Knocks, class
of '89. Come to think of it, on closer inspection, it looks like a novelty
diploma you might find in a cereal box... and Dr. Floyd's name is written in in
crayon! Ulp...
81724: Dr. Floyd is here, wearing a long white coat and sitting behind his
desk.
81836: It's a prescription for a trial-size pack of valium.
81908: overstuffed sofas and tall picture windows provide a comfortable
environment in which to chill, read the paper, or just blow off classes. The
main desk is to the north.
82024: You're in a small elevator which reeks of tobacco. Knife-carved graffiti
adorns the walls.
82152: A small panel of buttons is located to the left of the door.
82236: Supposedly you can get a room here, but I've never heard of anyone
actually managing the trick. When you decide to give up, the lobby is south.
82340: Standing behind the front desk is a perky looking hotel employee.
82388: This little waiting area smells slightly of disinfectant and gives way
to a hall full of rooms, to the west.
82464: You are in your room at the hotel. You wonder briefly about the mental
state of the interior designer who thought up this color scheme, and hope to
yourself that he or she faced a slow and painful death, preferably involving
thousands of stinging insects. There is a door to the south.
