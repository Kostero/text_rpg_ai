town, and you don't really have the energy right now.

105012: "It'll be quicker in the chariot, Jesus."
105044: Mark says it will be quicker by chariot. It might be a good idea to
take his advice.
105104: There are Mark's personal belongings in the chariot. He doesn't want
them left unattended. It would be immoral to put them in jeopardy, considering
what a good friend he is.
105228: Despite the advantages to going by chariot, and the moral stigma of
leaving Mark's valuables unattended, you are intent upon going by foot. True -
the exercise will do you good, but there's still a niggling feeling that
something will go terribly wrong if you leave that chariot.
105422: Despite the warnings, you go off on foot, leaving the chariot, and
Mark's valuables unattended.

Later, when you return, you find the chariot is
no longer here. Someone has ridden off with them!

Mark comes running. "What?"
he says. "You didn't leave the chariot alone did you?" He takes your silence
for what it is. "Oh, Jesus. How could you? That chest contained some of my most
valuable belongings, including my manuscript - the book I'm working on, which
explains all about your miracles, as I have witnessed them..." Your stomach
lurches.

As a result of your mistake, a baseless, corrupted Gospel is
published, presumably by the chariot's thief. You and your disciples lose
credence. Some of you are put to death.

Without Mark's true Gospel,
Christianity has failed. As a result, this text adventure was never written.
Which means you never made the mistake of leaving the chariot behind in the
first place...

But if you didn't make the mistake, then the text adventure was
indeed written, but that means you DID make the mistake, which means you
didn't, which means of course you did, and...
106228: A wilder area of plants and shrubs, this side of Galilee is much less
populated. The lake lies behind you, to the south, and you can see a village
straight ahead, to the north.
106352: You get out of the chariot. The sheep leaps out and comes up beside
you.
106404: "Could you leave my net here please?" asks Peter, nicely.
106448: "If you wouldn't mind, I would really rather have my net back before
you go, Jesus." calls Peter from behind you.
106532: Walking on water is one thing; riding over it in a chariot is quite
another. I wouldn't try.
106600: A voice booms down to you from the heavens. It is your Father. "I
thought I would speak to you directly this time. I am imbuing in you the power
over the waters! From henceforth, your feet will not slip through the water if
you do not command them to. Use this power well!"
106796: You place a foot tentatively on the surface of the lake and ripples
emanate from around it. You place more pressure on it, and somehow the weight
is supported. You lift up your other foot and place that on the water too. It's
hard to believe; you are standing upright on the sea!
106996: There are no Baptisms here.
107016: The horses screech to a halt just outside the village.
107056: You're quite good, miracle-wise, but walking through walls is something
you just haven't mastered yet.
107132: You're quite good, miracle-wise, but walking through walls is something
you just haven't mastered yet.
107208: While the Sea continues in that direction, it's a long way to the next
town, and you don't really have the energy right now.
107296: Alas, you are yet to learn to walk on water.
107328: You are just outside a quiet village on the northern bank of the lake.
Your friend and student, Mark, lives here. There are four streets: one that
curves around to the northwest, one straight ahead, one that meanders
northeast, and another one to the east.
107508: You get out of the chariot. The sheep leaps out and comes up beside
you.
107560: The horses screech to a halt before they slip into the water.
107604: The warm, sandstone houses of the Village of Mark seem to beam at you
from either side.
107668: The long, straight street has a house on either side of it, both made
of warm sandstone.
107732: Warm sandstone houses line the street on both sides.
107772: The quaint sandstone houses of the Village of Mark beam at you from
both sides.
107828: The relative monotony of rows of sandtone houses is occasionally broken
by a geranium hanging from a windowsill.
107908: A small alley leads to a parallel street to the north and the village
can be left to the southeast.
107976: A small alley leads to a parallel street to the south.
108016: A small alley leads to a parallel street to the northeast and the exit
from the village is south.
108084: A small alley leads to a parallel street to the southwest.
108128: A small alley leads to a parallel street to the east and village can be
exited to the southwest.
108196: A small alley leads to a parallel street to the west.
108236: A small alley leads to a parallel street to the southeast and the exit
of the village is to the west.
108308: A small alley leads to a parallel street to the northwest.
108350: A farmer crosses the street, sowing some seeds onto the path. He goes
through the door on the right-hand side.
108432: A sooth-sayer appears on the street, crying "You have let go of the
commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men!" She goes through
the door on the left.
108554: An officer appears on the street, muttering under his breath. "Greed,
malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly..." He shakes his
head and walks absently into the house on the lefthand side. 

Then, rubbing
his nose, he decides it would be best if he opened the door first. Which he
does.
108780: A Greek lady runs down the street, shouting for you to heal her
daughter. Before you can say anything, she has gone up the street, calling for
you to follow.
108894: You catch up with her. "Let the children eat all they want!" you call.
"Don't feed the dogs!"

She continues to run up the street, invariably trying
to think of an answer.
109024: Once again, you catch her, and she replies, coyly, "Yes, but even the
dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs." She beckons for you to follow
again; she's clearly leading you to her house.
109168: You find her, but she needn't have brought you there. You reply coolly,
"For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter." She is
overjoyed, and enters the lefthand house: hers.
109312: A Galilean fisherman walks down the street. You call to him: "Andrew!
Follow me!" The man looks startled. "Let me just get my coat!"

He runs into
the lefthand house.
109440: A sooth-sayer appears, chanting:

"A voice is heard in Ramah,
weeping
and great mourning,
Rachel weeping for her children
and refusing to be
comforted,
because they are no more."

She disappears into the house on the
right-hand side.
109614: A sooth-sayer comes down the street and proclaims "Blessed are the poor
in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven!" She disappears into the house
on the lefthand side.
109740: A second sooth-sayer comes down the street and declares "Blessed are
those who mourn, for they will be comforted!" She disappears into the house on
the lefthand side.
109860: Another sooth-sayer comes down the street and announces "Blessed are
the meek, for they will inherit the earth!" She goes through the door on the
left.
109970: Yet another sooth-sayer comes down the street and cries "Blessed are
those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled!" She
goes into house number 6, on the left.
110106: A further sooth-sayer comes down the street and cries "Blessed are the
merciful, for they will be shown mercy!" She goes into house number 7, on the
left.
110222: Yet another sooth-sayer comes down the street and cries "Blessed are
the pure in heart, for they will see God!" She traverses her way into number 8.
110334: Yet another sooth-sayer comes down the street and cries "Blessed are
the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God!" She goes into the house
on the left - number 9.
110462: Yet another sooth-sayer comes down the street and cries "Blessed are
those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven!" She goes into house number 10, on the left. Quite where all those
sooth-sayers came from is a veritable mystery.
110658: The lefthand door is marked with the sign of a cross.
110700: You see an easter egg resting against the righthand door.
110852: A solid wall blocks your passage.
110888: You get out of the chariot. The sheep leaps out and comes up beside
you.
110940: You step through the wormhole cautiously and emerge in...
110982: The horses screech to a halt before they hit the wall.
111024: The horses screech to a halt before they hit the wall.
111064: The horses screech to a halt before they hit the wall.
111104: The horses screech to a halt before they hit the wall.
111324: It is a small, cosy room, with a number of oil lamps to supplement the
last light of the setting sun that enters through the windows.
111560: simple wooden table in the middle and protrusions of rock around the
edge of the room serve as counters. An oven is inset into the corner
111680: A solid wall blocks your passage.
111704: It would be rude to stray into the other quarters of the man's house.
His hospitality is already gracious.
111780: "I shay!" calls Yonah. "Would you mind awfully returning my baking
tray? There's a good fellow!"
111856: "Jesus!" calls Yonah. You stop. "You've still got my baking tray!" He
laughs.
111920: It is a very large loaf of bread, which filled the whole pan. Dividing
it might be a good plan.
112008: It's too unwieldy for you to take.
112036: The easter egg disappears in a puff of anachronistic logic.
112084: The oven has two shelves - lower and upper - and is inset into the
northern wall.
112144: There is a baking tray on the bottom shelf. The oven itself is not lit.
112196: There is a baking tray on the top shelf. The oven itself is not
currently lit.
112252: It looks as though the bread has baked.
112282: The bread is gradually becoming crispier in the oven, but isn't
finished.
112338: The dough is currently being baked in the oven.
112376: There is a big loaf of bread in the tray, which is burnt.
112420: There is a big loaf of bread in the tray. Don't leave it too long or it
will burn.
112482: There are five loaves of bread in the tray and now they are burnt!
112532: There are five loaves of bread in the tray. Don't leave them too long
or they'll burn.
112596: Your dough is in the lower shelf, on a tray.
112628: "Yesh, yesh," says Yonah, as you are about to light the oven. "Carry on
and use the oven! Bake thy bread and lie in it, if you will!"
112728: "Yes, yes," says Yonah, as you are about to light the oven. "Do use the
oven if you need it, Jesus. It's no payment for what you did for me, but it's
probably the best I can do."
112862: You light the oven using the lamp, setting it nicely ablaze.
112908: Christ! How cruel, vindictive and sadistic can you be?
112948: You should put it on a tray first.
113004: There is nothing to close. It's that sort of oven.
113048: Christ! How cruel, vindictive and sadistic can you be?
113088: You should put it on a tray first.
113116: You should put it on a tray first.
113140: Christ! How cruel, vindictive and sadistic can you be?
113180: You cook the fish in the oven, knowing that sushi is an acquired taste
in these parts.
113240: The dough is baking nicely in the oven.
113268: It could do with a little more baking.
113296: Your divine fingers resist the heat and remove the tray from the hot
oven.
113348: They are protrusions of rock, and are likely used as cooking surfaces.
113400: It is a simple baking tray, and it looks like it will hold all of your
dough.
113456: It is a simple baking tray - quite useless to you.
113492: It's a simple, utilitarian blade.
113520: The lamps are simple and illuminating.
113548: You carefully take an oil lamp from the counter.
113584: The lamps are simple and illuminating.
113612: You drop the oil lamp and it sinks into the lake.
113648: The crude, makeshift table has four similarly-constructed chairs at it.
Your foster-dad Joseph could have made much more out of the same amount of
wood.
113756: But the table and chairs are Yonah's!
113784: It's Yonah's front door.
113804: It's a simple ceramic cup.
113824: The wine splashes into the lake and the cup sinks to the bottom.
113868: The cup splashes into the lake and sinks.
113900: The ceramic jug appears to contain wine.
113964: You'd better stay sober for your miracle.
113996: You pour yourself another cup of wine.
114024: Yonah is drinking wine out of the cup.
114064: I don't think Yonah would appreciate that.
114096: Mark is drinking wine out of the cup.
114136: I don't think Mark would appreciate that.
114168: A deep-green colour, this hedgerow is lined with dock and other wild
flowers. It sweeps all the way round the grassy field, separating it from other
fields beyond.
114284: It's rather difficult to find footholds in a hedge.
114320: A deep green in colour, the hedgerow sweeps all the way round the
grassy field, separating it from other fields beyond.
114404: It's rather difficult to find footholds in a hedge.
114446: OK, we'll just pick something at random...
114484: You can't think of anything to drop.
114512: You look up at the roof, which promptly fades away, replaced with a
large, ghostly image of an eye, which winks at you. You blink, and the eye has
gone, replaced by an ordinary synagogue roof. Nobody else seems to have
noticed, so you put it down to an Act of God.
114700: The roof is as plain as a roof gets.
114728: The walls are stone grey. Drapes adorn them.
114760: The walls of the synagogue are grey stone - strong and sturdy. If only
the same could be said for people's faith - well, minus the "grey stone" bit. A
grey, stone faith would be taking things a little too far.
114908: The houses are made of sandstone. As such, they can be described as
sandy.
114964: The walls are made of sandstone. There are four of them.
115004: You are outside. Your walls are purely metaphorical in nature.
115068: The brick house has a small wooden door, which is shut.
115108: It's locked. You could try knocking.
115136: You may be the Messiah, but that doesn't give you immunity from charges
of breaking and entering.
115204: It doesn't budge. You could try knocking.
115236: Knock and the door will be opened unto you! Well, if there's someone
home, anyway.
115296: You may be the Messiah, but that doesn't give you immunity from charges
of breaking and entering.
115364: You may be the forthcoming saviour of Mankind, but that doesn't give
you immunity from charges of breaking and entering.
115448: The brick house has a small wooden door, which is shut.
115488: It is marked with the sign of a cross.
115532: The door swings open freely. There, in the doorway, lies a swirling,
oval portal, which seems to lead to the field...
115620: It's locked. You could try knocking.
115648: You may be the Messiah, but that doesn't give you immunity from charges
of breaking and entering.
115716: It doesn't budge. You could try knocking.
115748: Knock and the door will be opened unto you! Well, if there's someone
home, anyway.
115808: The sandstone wall at the end of the street could be mistaken for a
house, if it had doors and windows. As it is, it's just a wall. As for the
actual houses, those walls are made of sandstone.
115944: A grand and majestic building, the synagogue stands tall at the top of
the city.
116028: Dotted with clover, the grass looks... surely you know what grass looks
like?!
116088: Surely you know what grass looks like?!
116116: You're not a cow; you're the Messiah.
116148: Shiny and silver, this is the coin that your Father gave you. Spend it
well.
116204: The coin sinks without trace into the lake.
116236: Laden with foodstuffs of all types, the stall looks simply divine.
116284: Talk to the stall-holder if you wish to buy something.
116324: It's a melon. It's juicy. It's large. It's a large juicy melon.
116376: The melon splashes into the lake and quickly vanishes into the murky
depths.
116428: Black, pitted olives. From an olive tree. How much do you need to know
about olives?
116496: Soft, fine, and revolting raw, though it does make good bread.
116544: Baked flour is bland. Try making dough first.
116580: It's a small paper bag, which once contained flour.
116644: You fill the bag with water. Being paper, it disintegrates and the
water drops to the ground and seeps into the soil.
116728: You fill the bag with water. Being paper, it disintegrates almost
instantly.
116784: You put the bag in the pail. Being paper, it disintegrates almost
instantly.
116840: Clover (Latin name: Trifolium) is a very common flower, delicious for
kine, but not so edible for humans.
116924: Clover may be delicious for kine, but it's pretty unappetising for
humans.
116976: You rip up a handful of clover from in the grass.
117012: Clover (Latin name: Trifolium) is a very common flower, delicious for
kine, but not so edible for humans.
117104: Clover may be delicious for kine, but it's pretty unappetising for
humans.
117156: You have to leave some for the kine!
117196: As you drop the clover, the wind picks up: the clover is gone.
117244: Dock (Latin name: Rumex) is a highly useful plant that, when rubbed
against a nettle sting, seems to numb the pain.
117336: Dock may be delicious for kine, but it's pretty poisonous to humans.
117384: You pick a single dock leaf from near the hedge. One should be
enough...
117436: Dock (Latin name: Rumex) is a highly useful plant that, when rubbed
against a nettle sting, seems to numb the pain.
117544: As you drop the dock leaf, the wind picks up, and the leaf drifts away.
117596: Dock may be delicious for kine, but it's pretty poisonous to humans.
117644: You pick a single dock leaf from near the hedge. One should be
enough...
117696: Just a run-of-the-mill, utilitarian pail. Can hold any number of
liquids.
117760: The pail is full to the brim with water.
117788: Saturating the dough with wine doesn't seem like a good plan.
117832: It took you long enough to get the bread; putting it in a pail full of
water doesn't sound like a good idea.
117908: It took you long enough to get the bread; putting it in a pail full of
water doesn't sound like a good idea.
117984: In case you want to go to the seminar, you decide against ruining the
business card.
118124: You know, for the Son of God, you do come up with some funny ideas!
Putting a sheep into a metal pail! What a concept!
118212: And mess up the dough? Probably not a great plan.
118248: The coin splashes into the water and drops to the bottom with a clang.
118306: Dock (Latin name: Rumex) is a highly useful plant that, when rubbed
against a nettle sting, seems to numb the pain.

The leaf is dripping wet.
118426: Clover (Latin name: Trifolium) is a very common flower, delicious for
kine, but not so edible for humans.

The leaves are dripping wet.
118528: The melon creates such a splash as it drops into the pail that it gets
your robe wet. In the heat of the Israel sun, however, it dries in an instant.
118632: Made of oak, it is clearly strong enough to hold as many people as can
fit, as it is doing now. The synagogue is very crowded today.
118724: It is made of wood, but has some highly decorative features that make
it the grand focal point of the building. This month, it is adorned with green
hangings, the colour that denotes common time.
118860: The hangings are a deep green colour.
118888: The great oak door is wide open, and sounds of the town outside linger
through.
118944: You listen at the doorway. The people bustling from place to place in
the town outside really do make a din!
119020: What are you going to do, hold the praying people hostage?
119064: The man's lower arm adorns a red rash: he is afflicted by a nettle
sting.
119120: The marketplace looks dense with shoppers - you can hardly see the
surrounding buildings.
119184: There's no need: it looks like everything you need is on these market
stalls.
119240: Spanning for miles in every direction, the Lake of Gennesaret (as it is
often called), is an awesome feat of nature to behold.
119332: You take a few large gulps and feel thoroughly refreshed, if
ever-so-slighly queasy.
119392: You can see a number of fishes swimming through the freshwater lake
just below the surface.
119456: The lake contains freshwater. You cannot see any fishes.
119496: The dock leaf floats on the surface of the lake.
119668: The coin you threw into the lake seems to have washed up here.
119712: The coin flies through the air and lands in the lake with a loud plop.
119760: The coin flies through the air and lands in the lake with a loud plop.
However, only a few minutes later, you see the coin washing up onto the shore.
How curious.
119876: It took you long enough to get the bread; putting it in a pail full of
water doesn't sound like a good idea.
119952: In case you want to go to the seminar, you decide against ruining the
business card.
120012: It took you long enough to get the bread; putting it in a pail full of
water doesn't sound like a good idea.
120092: Spanning for miles in every direction, the Lake of Gennesaret (as it is
often called) is an awesome feast of nature to behold.
120184: Water. Just water. A large group of molecules made of 2 Hydrogen atoms
connected to an atom of Oxygen. That's about it.
120296: You take a few large gulps and feel thoroughly refreshed, if
ever-so-slighly queasy.
120356: You don't want to feed the people soggy bread!
120406: Clover (Latin name: Trifolium) is a very common flower, delicious for
kine, but not so edible for humans.

The leaves are dripping wet.
120518: Dock (Latin name: Rumex) is a highly useful plant that, when rubbed
against a nettle sting, seems to numb the pain.

The leaf is dripping wet.
120636: You scoop the pail into the water and fill it to the brim. The bag,
being paper, disintegrates almost instananeously.
120732: You scoop the pail into the water and fill it to the brim.
120772: You should keep the water in the pail.
120800: The pail is already full of wine.
120824: You have nothing in which to carry the water. You do get quite wet
trying, though.
120896: You can see to the bottom of the pail.
120924: You cannot see far into the water; it is too deep.
120980: Water. Just water. A large group of molecules made of 2 Hydrogen atoms
connected to an atom of Oxygen. That's about it.
121068: You take a few large gulps and feel thoroughly refreshed, if
ever-so-slighly queasy.
121128: Your pail is already full to the brim.
121156: You cannot see far into the water. It is too deep.
121192: A simple dough that can be used for making flat-breads.

God knows how
you're going to bake it.
121268: Best leave it in the pail. It'll ruin your healer's hands otherwise.
121320: You transfer the dough from the tray to the pail.
121356: It'll ruin your healer's hands! Go find your pail.
121396: The tray perfectly holds all of your dough - almost as if it was
designed especially for this purpose.
121466: You transfer the dough from the pail to the tray.
121506: "Bread: bottom shelf, if ye didn't know," says Yonah with a stifled
hiccough.
121568: "You use the bottom shelf for bread, by the way," Yonah calls to you.
121628: It is a simple and well-worn vessel, made by traditional craftsmen.
121676: The disciples shout for you to get into the boat.
121712: The disciples leap into the boat.
121738: You can see Peter from here, in his fishing boat, which also contains
his fishing equipment.
121806: You can see Peter here, smiling broadly in his boat.
121848: Peter waves to you from his boat.
121874: "Ahoy, Jesus!" calls Peter from his boat. "I'll tether it to the bank".
121936: The boat closes in on the bank.
121962: The boat swings in against the shore, and Peter tethers it.
122010: "I'll need my net," says Peter. "No point going fishing without the
net!"

122116: The boat moves along the water, travelling northwest.
122156: The boat moves along the water, travelling northwest.

"Here we are,"
says Peter, "We ought to be able to catch at least some fish here."
122454: Peter takes the net and throws it into the lake. It spreads over the
water and sinks. After a minute or so, he hauls it back in. But it is empty.
122562: "Oh dear," he says. "Well, why don't you try?"
122606: "Here we are," says Peter, tethering the boat to the northern shore.
122660: Peter calls over to you, "I hear that there's a deaf and dumb man in
the village yonder. I think he lives at 7 : 31 - why don't you pay him a
visit?"
122772: You dive into the boat just in time, and Peter untethers it from the
shore.

"Phew!" says Peter, sighing with relief.

And as you sail away across
the Lake Galilee, and as the shouts and cries of the frenzied crowd die away
behind you, you know that you will come across more and more people who need
the power of Christ. You, and your dad, and your disciples: together, you will
change the world.

But perhaps it wasn't such a good idea to do it five
thousand people at a time.
123116: Alas, you have not learnt to walk on water yet.
123152: "Could you leave my net here please?" says Peter, before you can leave.
123204: Jesus, you're good, but you're not that good!
123240: The boat bobs serenely to and fro on the water.
123276: It is used for catching fish.
123300: Peter is the fisherman around here. Wait for his instruction.
123344: You throw the net into the lake. It sinks.
123376: You can see Peter here, in his fishing boat.
123410: You haul the net back in.

"Well done!" says Peter, a little
dispiritedly. "Two fish. That's not bad. Now, we shan't be able to go back
down-river, on account of the wind. I shall tether the boat at the northern
shore."
123580: Good God, man, you're a shepherd! Not a poacher!
123620: The fishing net cannot actually carry water!
123656: The Sun is setting over in the west - taking its time over the last
triumphant rays of colour.
123728: You cannot literally see the wind, but you feel it blowing into you
from the northwest.
123788: You cannot literally see the wind, but you feel it blowing into you
from the southeast.
123848: You cannot literally see the wind, but you feel it blowing into you
from the northwest.
123908: It is a battered silver coin.
123932: You can see a shekel here.
123952: I should hope you are already familiar with your own fingers.
124000: You put your fingers into the man's ears briefly. He looks mildy
surprised, but does not say anything.
124072: You douse your fingers in the wine.

Well that was pointless.
124118: You douse your fingers in the water.

Well that was pointless.
124168: Your signature beard is just the right length for stroking pensively.
124216: You stroke your long brown beard meditatively.
124248: They're tatty, to say the least, but they do the job.
124292: I think you should continue to wear them, for purposes of comfort.
124340: White and shabby, it has accompanied you for a long way, sheltering you
from the weather nicely. You've become quite attatched to it.
124440: A public display of nudity wouldn't be very appropriate in this
context.
124492: The chariot is a plain, wooden affair, suitable for carrying up to two
people. It is pulled along by two excitable horses.
124580: It makes quite a noise when it trundles along the ground.
124620: The sheep sits in the chariot beside you.
124652: You can hear the sheep bleating from the street.
124688: You put the sheep into the chariot first. It's a pretty heavy sheep!
124740: You get out of the chariot. The sheep leaps out and comes up beside
you.
124792: They're quite healthy as it is, as evidenced by their energetic
gallops.
124908: The horses lap up the water and eye you contentedly.
124944: Mark's personal chariot is here.
124972: They are the left-overs from the feeding... There's a quite a lot of
them!
125032: There seem to a be lot of pieces left over from the feast. You can see
people with spare scraps of bread.
125106: "Gather the left-overs!" you call. And your disciples do exactly that.
And when they return, they are holding twelve basketfuls of the scraps. You can
hear the collective gasp of five thousand people. 

"Well done, Jesus," says
Peter. "They've gone wild at the miracles you have performed." 

"Don't look
now," says Mark, "but I think the crowd is encroaching on you. I suggest a
hasty retreat." 

You and the twelve disciples walk slowly and calmly away from
the crowd, but you can only keep it up so long. 

"He's the Son of God!" they
are calling. "He fed us with five loaves and two fish alone!" 

"OK," you say
coolly. "Make a run for Peter's boat."
125596: The disciples shout for you to get into the boat.
125632: You took those once; look at the trouble it got you into!
125676: While dropping the scraps might make a good diversion, it's probably
better not to spend time thinking about it - you're being chased by a large
crowd!
125782: The crowd follows you, yelling wildly.
125814: The crowd follows you, bawling vehemently.
125850: The crowd comes after you, bawling vehemently.
125888: The crowd comes after you, yelling wildly.
125922: The crowd pursues you, yelling wildly.
125954: The crowd pursues you, bawling vehemently.
125990: "And he made me able to hear and speak!"
126024: "He hit me on the head with a stone tablet!"
126058: "There were twelve baskets left over!"
126090: "I saw him transform himself into a loaf of bread and a cup of wine!"
126142: "Hey! Stop pushing me, you moron!"
126174: "He turned water into wine at my wedding!"
126208: "He heals people even on the Sabbath day!"
126242: "Have you taken out an insurance policy?!"
126278: "He made that bread with flour bought from MY stall!"
126322: "I only had to touch his clothes and I was cured!"
126362: "He has come from Heaven to save us!"
126394: "He has come from Hell to tempt us!"
126426: "God will forgive us! Kill him!"
126456: "Jesus, how do you feel about the response to your miracles?" says a
woman carrying a strange black device.
126534: "I was paralysed and Jesus cured me! Hear my success story!"
126582: "Jesus - do you recommend Colgate?"
126614: "He has more compassion than all beings in the cosmos put together!"
126666: "Chase the Son of God, for He will heal thee!"
126706: "They're getting away! But there are still so many to heal!"
126754: The shouts and cries of the crowd are persistent in the background.
126804: It's a swirling, pulsating, semi-transparent oval.
126844: Piles of ripe, fresh fruit and vegetables, picked today, cover many of
the stalls. There's too much to see all at once.
126932: That might be difficult given your current less-than-fantastic
financial situation.
126992: You certainly don't have enough money for all of them! Jacob seems to
want to sell you a melon though.
127064: Slaughtered this morning, the prime organic chicken looks positively
delicious.
127120: Your powers of resurrection are reserved for humans.
127156: All of the religious teachings on this stall are enlightening, but they
all have very high price tags.
127228: On a stall to your right, there are many musical instruments of all
shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common: their exaggerated
prices.
127332: A voice suddenly intercepts your examination of the humble-looking
ferret, booming down from heaven with the simple words: "FORTY-TWO!"
127436: "I see you're browsing for ferrets," says the stall-holder. "Just so
you know, we have an offer going on ferrets at the moment.
127530: Buy forty-two, get another forty-two. While stocks last, of course."
127586: Three shekels a month, interest-free."
127620: Ferrets don't usually taste very nice, but I guess the right spices
might make it edible.
127684: It must be your imagination, but you could swear the ferret is
whispering to itself, over and over again: "Forty-two, forty-two, forty-two..."
127792: Small and pretty, these flowers certainly improve a fields aesthetics.
127848: Since you do not have a wife at the moment, picking flowers would be
pointless.
127904: Atop a mound, the bright, open nature of this gleaming meadow makes it
a perfect meeting place for Bethsaida's many townspeople. From the top, you can
see for quite a distance.
128028: The desert beyond Bethsaida seems to go on for miles. The hot dunes
look harsh and foreboding.
128096: The town of Bethsaida sprawls along the valley, melting into the desert
seamlessly.
128156: The people bustling from place to place really do make a din!
128200: It's the wine, which you shamelessly created from water.
128260: You pour out the wine. What a waste!
128412: It is a large, wooden chest, adorned with an ornate pattern.
128456: It is far too heavy to move on your own.
128484: But it's Mark's personal chest, containing his private and most
valuable possessions. You cannot bring yourself to pry.
128572: There is a large ornate chest here - the sort of large, ornate chest
that would contain something rather valuable.
128652: Bright red, they seem to break the monotony of identical houses
perfectly.
128704: It is out of reach. Why would you want to reach it, anyway? Geraniums
are two-a-penny around these parts.
128780: This plain windowsill's only purpose is to hold a pot of geraniums.
128828: It is out of reach. Why would you want to reach it, anyway? You don't
want to break into the house.
129602: God."

As you finish reading, the tablet disappears completely.
129652: Just your average stone tablet, engraved with a message that seems to
be in Hebrew. Luckily, you speak Hebrew:
129734: "Well done, my Son. Soon you will be able to make the bread you need to
feed the people. But there is one more thing you must do...
129834: "I expect you have been wondering how you will return to the other side
of the lake. I will help. In this same village, you will find a woman who
suffers from a cranial issue of blood. Cure her, and in return, I will give you
the ability to walk on water!
130018: "P.S. Sorry about previous misjudgments in my aim. Tablet-dropping was
so much easier in Moses' day, you know."
130106: Mark quickly scans the stony message (being familiar with your Father's
Tablet Messaging Service), and a look of recognition comes over his face.

"He
must be referring to Merom," he says. "The woman with the haemorrhage. She
lives at house 5 : 25. Take my chariot. You'll be there in no time. Oh, but pay
attention to the horses; it'll probably be difficult to get used to them, but
at least they're consistent. You'll soon get the hang of it."
130438: While Mark was talking, the tablet disappeared in a puff of logic.
130488: The sheep exudes feel-good vibes. It's an adorable animal.
130534: The sheep bleats at you conversationally.
130566: The sheep takes the opportunity to do a spot of grazing.
130608: The sheep munches at the grass and other plants in the field.
130652: Your sheep grazes on some clover in the hedgerow.
130688: Your sheep muches merrily at some of the dock in the hedgerow.
130732: The sheep laps up some of the water from the lake.
130768: Your sheep takes a few gulps of water from the lake.
130806: The sheep drinks cheerily from the lake.
130838: Your sheep takes the opportunity to drink some of the lake water.
130898: Your sheep is here, contemplating its situation.
130936: The sheep looks pensively up at you.
130964: The sheep followed you here, and is standing obediently at your side.
131014: Your sheep looks lovingly at you.
131042: The sheep looks up at you expectantly.
131072: The sheep stands at your left side, looking cute.
131108: A lost sheep is here, contemplating its existence.
131146: There is a sheep here, looking lonely.
131178: A solitary sheep prowls the street, looking pitiable.
131220: A wandering sheep wanders past you, looking cute.
131256: The sheep ambles away up the street.
131284: The sheep wanders to the street parallel to this one.
131324: The sheep turns around and leaves the village.
131360: The sheep ambles away up the street.
131388: The sheep turns around and goes back down the street.
131428: The sheep ambles idly into the village.
131458: The sheep ambles away up the street.
131488: The sheep leaves the scene, going back down the street.
131530: A sheep sidles up to you and stares at you with watery eyes.
131576: A sheep wanders down the street towards you.
131610: Your trusty sheep has returned to you! Awww...
131650: Your sheep bounds down the street towards you until it reaches you.
131702: What's that? Is it a cloud? Is it a ghost? No! It's the Wandering
Sheep, bounding up towards you. The groovy sheep is back in town!
132008: The sheep is already too persistent in following you everywhere.
132052: "Baa!" says the sheep indignantly.
132082: Do Messiahs dream of groovy sheep?
132112: You take a hold of the heavy sheep, receiving no resistance, and raise
it into your arms.
132174: The sheep bleats maniacally and resists all attempts to pick it
up.

And you shouldn't blame it. It doesn't know where you've been.
132272: You give the sheep an encouraging pep talk.
132304: The sheep merely bleats at your discussion of universal forgiveness.
132352: The sheep just stares into your eyes, looking adorable.
132392: You search the sheep thoroughly and you find...

Wool!
132436: It might be a noble sacrifice to you, but to the sheep, it's life or
death!
132492: I don't think it would enjoy getting wet!
132524: The sheep does not have the marvellous abilities that you have. It
would be helpless.
132584: The sheep ambles along beside you.
132612: The sheep trots merrily beside you.
132640: The sheep trots cheerfully on your left side.
132674: The sheep trots cheerfully by your side.
132708: The sheep follows cheerily on your right side.
132744: Your sheep trots obediently beside you.
132780: All of the crowd has been fed; yet miraculously there are still scraps
of bread and fishes left over! Well, their hunger for nourishment may be sated,
but their hunger for miracles only grows stronger.
132920: Their hunger for nourishment may be sated, but their hunger for
miracles only grows stronger.
132984: A large crowd of people, all very hungry, waits impatiently for your
miracle.
133040: A crowd has gathered here today, to watch the Son of God at work
performing a miracle.
133228: They want to be fed. They have no use for
133258: One of the five thousand pipes up.
133288: Coming in all shapes and sizes, the people traversing the town today
have just two things on their minds: shopping and prayer. In that order.
133436: These people seem to be engrossed in prayer. It might be best not to
disturb them.
133500: Uniformly brick, utilitarian houses line the streets of Bethsaida.
133552: In various shades of pink, handbags are the must-have accessory in
Bethsaida this year.
133616: You've never really been interested in fashion.
133652: You do not have enough money to buy a melon, let alone an entire
handbag.
133704: An originally very handsome man, he has been stricken with leprosy for
many years, thus disfiguring his body.
133780: A leper stares into the gently lapping water.
133812: A leper gazes into the water's depths.
133840: A leper sits on the grass, contemplating his ailment.
133878: A fishing boat cruises down the lake, heading for the far shore.
133928: A small fishing vessel bobs past you along the lake and is gone.
133976: A pair of moorhens swim down the lake before taking off into the
distance.
134030: A swan swims serenely by the shore and is gone.
134068: A coot swims purposefully towards the opposite shore.
134108: A blackbird flies out of the hedge and off into the distance.
134156: Just cured of leprosy (and very handsome), he seems to be unconscious.
Your father works in mysterious ways.
134236: Your father works in mysterious ways.
134264: You can't kick a man when he's down!
134344: A fishing boat cruises down the lake, heading for the far shore.
134392: A small fishing vessel bobs past you along the lake and is gone.
134440: A pair of moorhens swim down the lake before taking off into the
distance.
134494: A swan swims serenely by the shore and is gone.
134532: A coot swims purposefully towards the opposite shore.
134572: He is a very handsome man, now that his disfigurement has been cured.
And it's all thanks to you. Shame about the stone tablet business.
134668: The erstwhile leper sits up woozily and rubs his swollen cranium. He
looks around dazedly, and does not move.
134748: Mid-thirties with shabby clothing, his happy face can't help but make
you smile.
134806: "Hey! Come over here and see my beautiful food stall, Jesus!", calls
the stall-holder from not too far away.
134892: "Hey!" he says indignantly. "Turn off the debugging verbs!"
134940: The stall-holder looks at the sheep carefully. "I'd hold on to a sheep
like that. Such groovy sheep are hard to come by in times such as they are." He
gives you a sage nod, and the sheep beams with pride.
135088: and inspects it. "It's not worth anything, I'm afraid," he concludes
with a sniff, and hands
135160: Just use T[ALK] TO Jacob or SHOW NOUN TO Jacob.
135212: An impertinent man, who seems to be ailed with a sting from a stinging
nettle.
135268: "Hey, Jesus!" a man whispers, getting up from his pew. "If you're so
great, heal me of this nettle sting!"
135348: The stung man looks pointedly at you, waiting for your healing.
135392: "Yes," the man says desperately. "That's what I need!" And he snatches
the dock leaf out of your hand and rubs it fiercely on his sting.
135492: You give the dock leaf to the man and he rubs it on the afflicted area.
135544: When he's stung himself again, he'll let you know.
135582: After a short while, the irritation lessens and the man cries out, "You
are truly the Son of God! I love you, Lord Jesus! 

"The only thing that I have
by way of a reward is this metal pail. I hope you can find use for it."


Suddenly, a powerful beam of light streams through the open doorway of the
synagogue, and an angel of the Lord, no less, waltzes in, carrying a stone
tablet with great reverence. As the angel comes closer to the dumbstruck man,
it trips over its dress, sending the tablet flying towards the man, who is
knocked down by the blow. The angel blushes and promptly dissolves into the
air. 

You hear your Father's voice, amplified somewhat in the synagogue,
muttering about not being able to get the staff. Nobody else seems to have
noticed the commotion.
136136: Just cured of a nettle sting, he seems to be unconscious. Your father
works in mysterious ways.
136204: The man is wearing customary robes, which are quite dusty. Once ailed
by a nettle sting, he is now in good health - well, apart from the sore head
from that tablet. The Lord moves in mysterious ways, though.
136350: The formerly stung man gets up dazedly and rubs his sore head. He
staggers over to a pew and you can no longer make him out from the plethora of
other praying people.
136468: Simon, whom you named Peter, is a good friend, and one of your most
loyal students.
136528: "Oh ho!" says Peter with a chuckle. "Timothy of Tabgha. He's a
character. I wouldn't have anything to do with him. His methods are very
fishy."
136636: "Oh, God knows about that," says Peter.
136668: You advance on Peter and give him a blow, at which he tumbles into the
lake. He is so surpised that he can barely let out a scream.
136762: How can the Son of God attack another human being? YOU are an imposter!
136820: How can the Son of God attack another human being? YOU are an imposter!
136876: "It's a good net," Peter replies. "I got it from my father, years and
years ago. It was one of the latest models at the time, but it still serves me
well today. I remember the day I first used it..." Peter goes off on a long
nostalgic tale about his net through the ages, and you have to admit that you
don't pay an awful lot of attention.
137120: "Yes, it's a good net," says Peter.
137152: "Oh ho!" says Peter with a chuckle. "Timothy of Tabgha. He's a
character. I wouldn't have anything to do with him. His methods are very
fishy."
137260: "No, no," says Peter. "Have a go yourself, really."
137304: "Thanks," says Peter, taking the net.
137336: "You keep it: it might come in handy," replies Peter, kindly.
137384: You wave at Peter enthusiastically, pleased to see him.
137424: He is a a fairly short man with dishevelled hair. He used to be deaf
and mute, but he is now cured.
137496: The man can grunt and make other sounds with his breath; otherwise his
auditory faculties are entirely cut off from the outside world. Visually, his
hair is quite dishevelled, and he is fairly short. There are deep lines on his
forehead and around his eyes.
137676: The deaf and mute man folds his arms and looks at you intently.
137732: The man lies unconscious on the ground. Mark is kneeling next to him,
trying to help.
137792: You wave to the man, but he just shakes his head.
137828: Shaking his head clearly indicated that he does want it.
137868: He just shakes his head - to be healed is his only desire.
137912: "Thanksh, but I don't want your bread!" He hands you the bread and puts
the tray on the counter.
137984: "Thanksh, Jeshush!" He puts the tray on the counter.
138024: Mark and Yonah take one end each of the heavy chest and manage to get
it out of the chariot.
138090: "Go on in, Jesus," says Mark, as he and Yonah approach, carrying the
ornate chest.
138156: Mark and Yonah come in, carrying the ornate chest between them. They
put it down on the floor, and Mark wipes his brow. Yonah merely looks amazed at
the thud made by the chest hitting the ground.
138294: Mark and Yonah head on into the house with the chest.
138336: Mark and Yonah seat themselves at the table. "I just can't believe I
can speak and hear!" says Yonah. "It's amazing!"
138426: Mark pours you a drink from the jug of wine and hands it to you.
"Here," he says. "Have a celebratory drink."
138510: Mark and Yonah both take a gulp from their own cups of wine.
138556: "Yes, it's wonderful being able to speak properly again," says Yonah.
"And it's all thanks to Jesus, so I thank you!"
138646: "You must have imbued me with the knowledge of Aramaic - your
language," says Yonah gratefully. "That's quite a feat."
138738: "Here's to speech!" Yonah proclaims.

They drink from their glasses.
138794: "So did you hear about John the Baptist?" says Mark.
138838: "Oh yes. A terrible affair. Terrible," says Yonah. They take another
gulp.
138900: "Did you bury him?" Yonah asks Mark.
138930: "Bury... bury..." says Mark. "Bury who?"
138970: Yonah hesitates. He takes a sip of his wine. "John," he says shortly.
"John the... John the whatsit. The Baptisht."
139064: "Yes, we buried him," Mark answers. "Yes, yes." He stares into his
glass solemnly. "Another?" he says to Yonah, and they refill their cups and
take a gulp.
139184: "Well, I thought I had it hard when I couldn't shpeak or hear," says
Yonah. "But to be dead! Well, I just can't imagine that!"
139284: "True indeed," says Mark to Yonah. "Now there's an interesting thing.
Do you know Peter? Also called Simon?"
139370: "Heard of him," says Yonah to Mark. "Fisherman ishn't he?"

"That's the
fellow," says Mark, with another sip of wine.
139466: "Well, Peter wants to be the one..." says Mark, pointing at Yonah
accusingly, "the one... who greets the newcomers to Heaven!"
139566: "Does he," says Yonah, taking another sip. "Does he now? Well that must
be a... a demanding job, if ever there was one."
139662: "And I'll tell you something else," says Mark.

"Yes?" says
Yonah.

"Yes," Mark answers. "I'll tell you something else: he wants pearly
gates there."
139786: "Pearly gates, eh?" says Yonah. "Yes, I shuppose a little redecorating
wouldn't go amissh... amissh, mash, mish."
139878: "'Ere," says Yonah. "Have you heard the wicked rumoursh?"
139928: "Of course," says Mark. "It is part of the job."
139968: "THE plot!" Yonah says, banging his glass on the table and coughing
furiously. "The plot to kill Jeshushushusheroo!"
140056: "Oh everyone knows about that," Mark answers. "Even Jesus himshelf
knows about that! It's just a question of time isn't it?"
140150: "Wicked though, isn't it? I mean, how wicked can they be?" He
hiccoughs.
140210: "Yes, I think they've losht the plot," says Mark.
140252: "No, no, no, no. That's precisely what they haven't losht! That's the
problem, you see!" says Yonah profoundly. "The problem is that they have not
losht the plot - in fact you could say they've found it!"
140406: "Quite sho," says Mark. "And I think it's jolly impertinent of them to
even think about crushifish... crushifish... What's that thing called?"
140518: "The putting on the crossh, you mean?" says Yonah. Mark murmurs and
nods. "Well that's your crushifission, crushuwooshi..."
140616: "Cruzeefixon," Mark blubbers, "Cruzee... fikshon. Cruss...
140668: "Well whatever it is, it's wicked," Yonah says.

"I'll drink to that!"
says Mark. They do.
140742: "Here's to Jeshush!" they toast, clinking their glasses. "And all who's
cured by him!" Mark adds afterwards.
140828: They are quite ordinary ears.
140892: It is a quite ordinary tongue in its appearance.
140928: You touch his tongue gently and then slowly withdraw your hand. The man
looks at you and takes a step backward toward his door.
141016: It's just a damp bit of fabric, being used by Mark to sponge the former
mute's forehead.
141080: He is one of your most loyal disciples and friends. He is wearing
similar clothes to you.
141142: Mark has fetched a damp cloth and is currently attempting to revive the
poor, cured man.
141210: Mark crouches here, tending to the unconscious man.
141250: The unconscious man lies cold on the floor, being tended to by Mark.
141304: "Swelling in the left frontal bone," says Mark, mostly to himself.
141356: "He had a bad hit. I don't know how long it'll be till he recovers, but
I'd better stay with him."
141432: "Do go on to where you need to go, Jesus. Take the chariot."
141480: "He had a bad hit. I don't know how long it'll be till he recovers, but
I'd better stay with him."
141556: He's too involved in his drunken discussions with Yonah.
141596: "Whenever you need to go, Jesus, please do. I know you must have many
other appointments."
141664: "I am in awe at your healing power, Lord Jesus!"
141704: "Ah, thank you," he says, taking the coin. "Mum's the word."
141752: Mark takes the pail and puts it over his head, laughing. "I have a pail
face!" he says, guffawing. Then he takes the pail off and gives it back to you.
142034: where am I?" he says, and then the fact that he can speak dawns on him,
and this triggers his remembrance. "Ah! I am cured!" he says gleefully.

Mark
helps the man to his feet, nodding as the man chatters away, exercising his
newfound vocal chords.

"Yes, yes," says Mark, interrupting him. "Let's go
inside and celebrate."

The door shuts behind them.
142296: The woman is not very old; it was a shame that she had suffered with a
haemorrhage for so long. But now she is cured, thanks to you.
142392: The woman is not very old, but has a fissure in her forehead from which
blood seeps. She is wearing a white gown.
142472: A woman stands by her front door, gaping at you.
142510: Bleeding from the head, a woman looks towards you hopefully.
142558: Standing by her front door, the woman looks solemn.
142600: A woman, clearly ecstatic at your healing, beams at you.
142644: They are your most loyal students.
142668: You consult your disciples, all of whom express their profound awe.
142718: "Wonderful! Simply wonderful, Jesus!" Peter proclaims.
142764: "I am flabbergasted!" says Simon.
142792: "I say, that was a jolly good trick, wasn't it?" Mark muses.
142840: "That was incredible!" says Matthew.
142870: "Doesn't this violate the conservation of energy law or something?"
says John thoughtfully. "Nah. Ignore me."
142956: "Such power! Such compassion! Such nourishment!" says Philip.
143006: "I am in a state of profound awe!" Thomas professes.
143048: "We must mass-market this technique," says Judas insidiously. "Only
joking!"
143108: The disciples are in too much shock at the miracle they have seen to
take notice.
143316: Wearing a shabby white robe and brown sandals, you look like you have
travelled a long way, yet you seem not to be weary from the journey. 

You
stroke your long, brown beard pensively.
144172: Well, you really messed that one up, didn't you?
144208: You have broken one of the ten commandments.
144240: The horses burst down the street in a torrent of energy, and then stop.
144292: The chariot careers down the street, then stops.
144328: Bursting with exuberance, the horses gallop down the street. They then
stop.
144384: You pass the bread and the fishes to the nearest people in the crowd,
and gradually the nourishment is distributed throughout all the people, each of
them eating and being sated, but still leaving enough for all the others. 

All
twelve of your disciples have arrived at the scene to watch the miracle.
Everyone is in a state of elated stupefaction - and the wonderment at your
powers grows to an unparalleled level. 

"Well," says Luke, "it certainly goes
to show that there is always enough food to go around." 

Mark chimes in. "I
think the people have truly conshumed the teachings of our Lord, and of his
shon, just as they have all conshumed these mere loaves of bread and two
fishy-ishes." 

"What shall we do now, Jesus?" asks Peter.
144912: Peter's boat waits here patiently.
144940: You do not have enough to feed this ravenous crowd of five thousand
people.
144992: "This famine! I can't stomach it!"
145020: "Please - don't talk to me about food! The last time I ate was at
sundown yesterday!"
145084: "The fishermen need to go up-stream, but cannot do so until the winds
are favourable!"
145148: "The fish are dying because of fertiliser run-off! Or so I was told..."
145204: "At least the water has not turned to blood, yet, as happened in Egypt
one time."
145264: "Hungry, oh so very hungry..." chant the crowd.
145304: "Woe! Woe! Oh for a little morsel!"
145336: "Woe!" After this sharp interjection, you hear only the rumbling of
ravenous stomachs.
145400: "This morning I dropped my daily bread, and the dog was devouring it in
half a second, I declare!"
145472: "Oh, to be sated! I can scarcely imagine the feeling when I am in such
a state!"
145532: "Sue the farmers for breach of contract!"
145564: "Oh yea - in my boredom I counted that there be five thousand people
assembled here."
145628: "The Roman noblemen are feasting as we speak! Revolt!"
145672: "I could eat three thousand mules in a Red Sea sauce, so hungry am I!"
145724: "I do not take the Lord's name in vain easily, but by God am I hungry!"
145780: "Food is a gift from God! We must have been naughty!"
145820: "We must work for our food! But the Lord makes it so difficult in the
drought!"
145880: "The Lord is mean, callous and sadistic to leave us without food!"
145928: "How will we ever be fed?" shouts someone. Indeed, it would ordinarily
look as though even two hundred danarii worth of bread could not sate this
ravenous crowd.
146044: "Eight months of my wages could not feed us all!"
146080: "We're doomed! Doomed, I tell you!"
146112: "We should never have followed this trickster here. It is a trap!"
146160: "Is this miracle forthcoming or are we going to have to wait all day?"
says a nearby member of the crowd, looking at his wrist-watch.
146256: "Let's hear it for Jesus!" says the nearest member of the crowd, and
starts clapping.
146320: "Give a big hand to THE Messiah!" someone shouts. Whoops and cheers go
up sporadically from the crowd.
146444: "We're very honoured to have you here today, Mr. Christ," says a
sincere woman at the front of the crowd. "Or can I call you Jesus? Anyway, I
hope you can help us." She melts back into the crowd.
146598: jesus, Sir - would you be interested in giving the keynote speech at
the annual fisherman's get-together next Sabbath? We'd be very honoured to have
such a distinguished orator as yourself. Well, don't answer now. Think it over.
Here's my card." The man melts back into the crowd.
146800: Timothy the fisherman spots you. "Ah! Jesus. Thought any more about
giving the keynote at the AFGT? No - you don't need to decide now. Chew it over
and get back to me." He melts into the crowd again.
146948: That fisherman who gave you his card spots you. "Ah! Jesus. Thought any
more about giving the keynote at the AFGT? No - don't need to decide now. Chew
it over and get back to me." He melts into the crowd again.
147104: "Do the Mexican wave!" someone shouts, but the idea is short-lived.
147156: You are surprised to hear yourself talking about ferrets.
147196: You mutter to yourself about the salvation of mankind.
147236: The crowd are too engrossed with their eating to talk.
147276: "Thankee, Lord Jeshushush. And thankee to the Lord your er, the Holy
Shpirit, for his mershy!"
147348: "I do thank you, Lord Jesus, for healing me. And I thank the Lord your
Father, my God, for his mercy!"
147428: The disease-ridden man replies: "I have had leproshy for many yearsh.
Heal me, Lord Jeshush." The drunken-sounding speech, together with the way the
leper is swaying from side to side, suggest that he has been drinking from the
lake recently.
147604: The disease-ridden man replies: "I have had leprosy for many years.
Heal me, Lord Jesus."
147672: "Cure me of this burden, Lord.", he replies.
147708: "I have been shunned because of my illness, Lord. Heal me."
147756: The leper merely hiccoughs forlornly.
147784: He just looks at you forlornly, in desperate need of healing.
147828: "How great it is to see you again, Jesus!" he says.
147868: "You have just one silver coin, you say? Well, this is your lucky day!"
he shouts, in his best salesman voice, "We have three items for that price: a
handful of fresh olives, a small bag of flour or a large melon. What do you
choose?"
148038: "A melon, some olives or some flour. All worthy items for purchase..."
he replies, looking at you pointedly."
148122: "Just think of all the things you can do with a melon. Or olives for
that matter. Or a bag of flour! Heaven's the limit!"
148214: "You know, you can make bread with flour. Ever considered that? Course
you can make fruit salads with melons, and as for olives - well, they have a
veritable array of culinary uses."
148348: "Made up your mind what to buy yet?" he says, with a sigh and a tap of
his fingers on the wooden stall.
148424: "When you have some money, you will delight in the things I have for
sale here!"
148484: "Do come and make a purchase when you have the money. We accept
shekels, pennies, Roman Express..."
148560: "The love of money is the root of all evil, as they say. So if you do
come across some money, you really should get rid of it - and what better place
than a market?!"
148680: "Please come back when you have the money, and I'll help you make a
purchase."
148740: The man is deeply engrossed in prayer.
148768: "Ouch! Stinging nettles are painful!" he cries.
148804: "I'm waiting for your wonderful healing powers, Jesus.", he says,
impatiently.
148864: He points impatiently to his sting. "I'm waiting for your wonderful
healing powers, Jesus."
148932: He doesn't respond, on account of the fact that he's been hit on the
head by a stone tablet.
149000: "I see the people are hungry. Terrible thing."
149036: "The fish are all downstream - to the northwest - but the wind is not
favourable."
149096: "You should send them all to the market, Jesus. We can't give them
nearly enough food."
149160: "We cannot possibly feed that crowd. Not while the wind is
unfavourable, anyway."
149220: "How many times do I have to tell you that the wind is blowing in the
wrong direction?!" he replies.
149292: Peter refuses to repeat himself again.
149320: "Jesus! A miracle has occurred! The wind suddenly changed direction!"
149372: "We can fish, after all. Maybe there is hope for feeding the people.
Why don't you come with me?"
149444: "Go on - get in the boat and we'll go together."
149480: "It shouldn't take long before we are in the ideal fishing ground."
149528: "I think I just about make out our destination on the horizon."
149576: "Here we are," Peter proclaims, "We ought to be able to catch at least
some fish here."
149644: "It's amazing how the wind picked up," Peter says absently.
149724: . "Like a sceptre!" he says, mostly to himself, "gliding over the
lake!"
149780: "Hello again, Jesus. I'm afraid we still can't go back by boat."
149832: "House 7 : 31," says Peter, "if you'd like to pay that man a visit. You
might be able to help him. Go on - look him up."
149928: "Well done on your fish-catching. I would say it was beginner's luck,
but I know that the power of God is within you."
150016: "Because the wind is now so strong to the northwest, we are unable to
return to the town, from whence we came."
150096: Mark sent me word of your new ability to walk on water! Bethsaida is
northwest along the lake - good luck!
150172: He's mute, so he doesn't respond to your desperate attempts at
communication.
150228: "Want some rye?" says Yonah. "Course ya do!" And he pours himself
another glass and drains it.
150300: He's too involved in his drunken discussions with Mark.
150340: "I shall blog about this - how you cured me from firsht prinshiples!"
150392: "I can see the headlines now! Messiah cures deafnessh and
dumbnesshnessh and muteness!"
150456: "I can see the headlines now! Messiah cures deaf-mute in cold blood!"
The man has clearly drunk too much.
150620: "I shall pass this story on to all the journalists I know, Mister
Jesus!"
150676: He looks at you excitedly and shouts about the miracle of sound and
speech.
150728: "Oh thank you, thank you!" she cries.
150760: "Thank you, Jesus! You are my Saviour, Lord!" she says, beaming
euphorically.
150820: Her beaming expression says more than a thousand words ever could.
150868: "I have been bleeding from the head for twelve years, Jesus, and I had
heard of your healing powers. I was going to find you in a crowd one day and
beg for you to heal me..."
150992: "This haemorrhage has impeded me for many years," the woman says.
"Please heal me."
151056: Her expression of sadness says it all - she needn't back it up with
words.
151108: Your words are lost in the noise of the people bustling from place to
place.
151160: "Did you know," says a woman in passing, "that our good old John the
Baptist was beheaded this morning? Oh, terrible!" She rushes off, muttering
about having to feed her ferret.
151292: "I'm trying to find a bargain on silk, for the wife," says a passing
peasant. "Can't find anything. Never mind!" He wanders off to browse.
151396: At the moment, you can't think of anything to say.
151432: When he's stung himself again, he'll let you know.
151472: He has a simple, earthly ailment. Such ailments warrant earthly cures.
151524: Your father works in strange ways.
151548: You reach down and touch the leper, who holds his breath in wonder.
Then suddenly, a great change comes upon him, and he shouts for joy. 

"Thank
you Lord Jesus! My leprosy is cured!" cries the leper, joyously. "What a happy
day it is!" 

A stone tablet comes hurtling towards the Earth and hits the
now-cured leper squarely on the head. You hear a loud "D'oh!" from above.
151822: You touch a part of the woman's head that is not bleeding, and the
fissure slowly closes up. As it does, the woman's face becomes ever more
ecstatic, and when it is finally gone, she grasps her head reverently, and then
sinks to her knees in thanks.

"Oh thank you, thank you, Lord Jesus! Thank you!
I must repay you!"

Just then, the wandering sheep waltzes along the street,
and the woman rushes out to it and grabs it.

"This is my sheep!" she
proclaims. "It was lost, but now it is found." She looks pensive for a few
moments. The sheep merely looks startled. "It needs a shepherd," she concludes.
"I think you are the perfect shepherd for him. Take him. As my gift to you."


She hands the sheep over.
152340: You touch the man softly, as you did with the leper. You say something
to him, but he still doesn't seem to answer, and remains silent. You tell him
there's a sale at the market and complimentary wine! He still doesn't answer,
so you conclude that your healing hasn't worked.
152536: You're being rather vague about it.
152564: They seem to be quite healthy already.
152592: You perform a miracle and everyone is fed and happy.
152632: You mix the two ingredients together and, almost miraculously, you end
up with a dough. Well, not so miraculously, but you still end up with dough.
152736: I don't think that would be very wise.
152764: You'll have to use the chariot and count along the way.
152804: What a waste of time that would be!
152880: houses on one side. Then you come all the way back again, counting the
houses on the other side of the street, which comes to
152968: . You add them up and arrive at a figure of
153000: By the time you've finished counting, all five-thousand and forty-two
of them have died of hunger.
153072: He does have two ears. The problem is that they don't work.
153116: His two ears are now perfectly functional, thanks to you.
153156: Tired, are you? It's been a long day.
153188: Your enumeration is inconclusive.
153320: in a few fractions of a millisecond. But afterwards, he still claims
ravenous hunger.
153384: You call out for someone to buy your goods but nobody responds.
153472: Use MIX something [WITH/TO/INTO] something else.
153548: You say a silent prayer, but God seems to ignore it for the moment.
153596: You thank the Lord for what is about to be received, and you truly mean
it.
153652: You wave back at Peter enthusiastically, pleased to see him.
153696: I hate to break it to you, but there's currently nobody at whom you can
wave.
153752: The sheep gives you a friendly nod and a bleat.

154906: Owing to the ethereal but ever-present connection between Father and
Son, you do receive a short message, which interrupts your consciousness in a
powerful, almighty fashion.
155032: "You're doing swell, Son," He tells you.
155068: "Keep up the good work, Son," He says.
155100: "Feel my wrath! Oh sorry, wrong person. Will you stop interrupting me,
Jesus?"
155160: "Ferrets, Son. Remember the value of the ferret," are His wise words.
155216: "O Ye of Great Faith, continue thy goodness!" He proclaims.
155264: "I'm sorry, Jesus. I'm busy. Can't talk right now."
155412: but it's all very hush-hush. Don't talk about it."
155452: "Not now, Jesus, I'm busy! I'll say one last thing, though. WE
APOLOGISE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE."
155548: "A little bread and some fishes go a long way, Jesus. Remember that."
155600: "A dock leaf will not cure someone stung by faith!" are His profound
words.
155656: "The woman you seek lives at 5 : 25..."
155692: "The man you seek lives at 7 : 31..."
155724: "If there is anything you need, Son, thou shalt pray!"
155768: "Read thy Holy texts! Absorb thy scripture!" are His profound words.
155820: You have many of the powers of God vested in you, but this is not among
them.
155876: OK, if you're sure. You drag yourself through the hedgerow and
emerge... well, looking like you've been dragged through a hedgerow backwards.
155980: You do not have experience in sailing. Best leave that to Peter.
156028: Peter is already taking care of that.
156056: You'll need a suitable sailing vessel.
156084: You're about to plant the olives when one of the crowd comes up to you,
crying about how hungry he is. He pleads with you to give him the olives and
ends up snatching them off you, thrusting a silver coin into your hands before
you can protest.
156252: There are plenty of them here already.
156300: You focus your divine energy on the pail of water, causing riples of
pure Holy magic to spring forth on the surface. And lo! Behold a pail of wine!
156404: You focus your divine energy on the lake, causing ripples of Holy magic
to appear on the surface. And lo! The colour of the water has changed, just
slightly, into that of a truly divine white wine. Behold the Wine Lake of
Galilee! 

A great booming voice intercepts your consciousness and startles
you. 

"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?" says your Father. "Can't I leave you on your own
for five minutes without havoc being caused? CHANGE THAT LAKE BACK, THIS
INSTANT, JESUS! I'll tell your Mother!" 

This last threat is pretty severe, so
you hastily return the lake to its former, sober state and then grovel in
repentance.
156876: A booming voice comes down from Heaven. "THAT'S MY POWER, JESUS! I
RESERVE SOLE RIGHTS TO TURNING BODIES OF WATER INTO BLOOD!"
157012: You make five equal-sized loaves out of the dough.
157048: That's difficult when it's not on a surface.
157080: You should put it on a surface first.
157108: You cut the big loaf evenly into five separate loaves.
157148: Sliced bread hasn't been invented yet! What were you thinking?!
157196: How brutal of you to think of such a thing! How CAN you be the Son of
God?! You are an impostor!
157268: Specify what you will use to do that.
157296: Lighting the oven with your bare hands probably isn't the best idea
you've ever had.
157356: We're way past burning bushes at this stage.
157388: You give the animal an affectionate stroke.
157420: There are no culinary facilities here.
157512: You're the Messiah, not Superman.
157672: I'm sure you could talk about it all day, but to whom will you say it?
157908: How can YOU be the Son of God, being so violent? YOU are surely an
impostor!
157972: Violence isn't the answer to this one.
158000: At this time of year, the sheep would be too cold without its wool.
158048: And destroy your trademark look? You would never be without that beard!
158100: Leave them to do their own shaving.
158128: That's not something you can drink.
158156: "Glory to God!" you shout. You are promptly punched in the face for
disturbing the peace.
158224: Did you really expect something to happen? Collossal Cave Adventure
won't be written for many years yet.
158300: I don't think this is the right moment for a game of Go Fish, however
fun it might be.
158364: You have much of the power of God vested in you. That should be enough,
shouldn't it?
158428: You kneel on the floor, readying yourself for prayer.
158466: You stand again, slightly annoyed at the lack of response.
158512: You don't need to kneel to talk with God.
158544: It'll be almost two full millennia before Zork is written, so quite
frankly, nothing can happen here.
158616: If you're stuck, perhaps you should ask your dad for advice, or type
'about'.
158672: This is the story of the Feeding of the Five Thousand, found in the
Gospels, in which Jesus feeds a ravenous crowd of five thousand people using
only five loaves of bread and two fishes. Type 'licence' for licence
information, or 'credits' for acknowledgements. 

While you are not
disadvantaged by being non-Christian, it might be a good idea to have a Bible
(or an Internet connection) handy while playing this game. If you get stuck, it
might be an idea to ask your dad for help... Good luck!
159026: We owe a massive debt of gratitude to Nolan Bonvouloir for his
extensive, exhaustive beta-testing, enthusiasm and fast turn-around of
responses. If it weren't for him, the laws of physics as you know them would be
rampantly and shamelessly broken all throughout the game. 

Thanks also go to
our other beta-testers: Sean Whitton, Sean Krauss and Redvers. 

And thank the
Lord for Graham Nelson's Inform 6!
159324: Sadly, there is not a single space on any of the long, oak pews in
front of you. Considering that it's your Father's house, this is something of
an annoyance.
159436: You should specify what you wish to buy.
159464: You should get out of the chariot before you fall out in the attempt.
159512: The door creaks open and an old man steps out. He looks at you
pensively for a few moments, without speaking, and then silently lifts his hand
in acknowledgement.
159628: You've already knocked, and he's already here. Remember?
159670: Mark opens the door.

"Hello Jesus. Look, I know you're busy, so I
won't ask you to join the party. The woman lives at 5 : 25, if you'd forgotten.
Good luck."

The door shuts behind him.
159818: Mark opens the door.

"Jesus - hello! Have you finished your errand?
Then do come in and join us," he says, invitingly opening the door wider. 

The
former deaf-mute comes to the door and looks at you with sheer wonderment in
his expression. "You're the man who healed me! Oh, thank you, thank you! I have
a voice, thanks to you! All those years listening to Aramaic pronunciation and
not being able to duplicate it myself - oh, I can't tell you how exquisite the
feeling is! Do come and join our little celebration!"

"Well," says Mark,
"could you help with my chest first, Yonah? I'd like to bring it in so it's not
unattended."

"Certainly," says the man. And they go out to the chariot.
160326: The door creaks open and a woman steps out. She eyes you curiously for
a few moments and then, in a moment of awed recognition, her jaw drops open.
160432: Funny, you seem to be getting deja vu...
160464: You hear creepy chanting from inside, and decide against knocking.
160512: I'm sure Andrew will just be a minute. Well, possibly.
160556: The Greek woman's head pokes out. "Thank you for your healing, Jesus,
but I'm expecting visitors." She closes the door again.
160650: You knock on the door, and it swings open just by the force of the
knock. Inside you see a family sat at a table, eating a meal. "Do you mind?"
says a man, turning to face you. "We're eating and being satisfied here. Go
away! Bloody evangelists!"

You shut the door and retreat.
160856: You knock on the door, and it swings open just by the force of the
knock. There, in the doorway, lies a swirling, oval portal, which seems to lead
to the field...
160972: There is no answer.
160988: Nobody responds to your knocking.
161012: No-one home.
161028: You eject some saliva onto your fingers.
161068: "Ah," says the man suddenly. "Ah! I... I..." He looks at you with
wonder in his eyes. "I speak!" he proclaims, and lifts his arms heavenward.
"And I can hear!" He taps on his door experimentally and listens to the sound
with boyish excitement. "Thank you, Lord Jesus! I will make sure everyone will
know how you cured me!"
161312: "And so will I," comes another voice from behind you. You turn around
to see your friend Mark, who is currently sat upon a personal chariot. "I shall
put it in my book," he says proudly.
161450: Suddenly there is a great whooshing sound, followed by a thump, then a
groan. A stone tablet has fallen from the sky and struck the cured man on the
head! He has fallen unconscious.
161582: "My God!" Mark exclaims, leaping off the chariot to come to the man's
assistance.
161648: The deaf man gives you a look of curiosity.
161680: You say the words, but nothing comes of it.
161712: Not having any skill in chariot riding, you don't have the necessary
control over the horses.
161778: You go back to the intersection.
161804: The horses screech to a halt before they hit the wall.
161844: You skip to the end of the street.
161870: You run to the end of the street.
161900: There is nothing to the end of which you can currently go.
161940: How exactly do you intend to do that?
161968: You can just take it; you don't need to catch it.
162008: You can only feed things that are animate.
162040: You make what you believe to be meaningful gestures at the poor man,
but he merely shakes his head.
162108: You always exhibit peace, to all men, when speaking.
162148: You make what you believe to be meaningful gestures at the poor man,
but he merely shakes his head.
162216: You make what you believe to be meaningful gestures at the poor man,
but he merely shakes his head.
162284: They speak Aramaic. There's no need for sign language!
162324: Specify which one you mean: the lefthand door or the righthand door.
162372: That house doesn't appear to be here.
162400: Specify which one you mean: the lefthand door or the righthand door.
162448: That house doesn't appear to be here.
162476: Specify which one you mean: the lefthand door or the righthand door.
162524: That house doesn't appear to be here.
162552: Your disciples call to you. "Jesus, come on!"
162592: Your Father, residing in Heaven, Hallowed be His name, does not
respond. Praying for something specific might get a better response.
162688: I'm sure the sheep appreciates your concern. God, however, seems to be
busy. Oh well, it's the thought that counts.
162772: You already have a pail full of it!
162800: A great booming voice emanates around you, and rocks the church to its
very foundations. "Water? Water? Get your own darn water! It's just in the
river, you nincompoop!" Strangely enough, nobody else seems to have noticed the
tremors.
162968: A great booming voice emanates around you, and rocks the church to its
very foundations. "If you want money, you'll have to earn it!" Strangely
enough, nobody else seems to have noticed the tremors.
163108: There are more important things to pray for.
163140: I think you have enough of that already.
163168: A great booming voice emanates around you, and rocks the church to its
very foundations. "The wind is at my command! It shall be as you wish, my
Son..." Strangely enough, nobody else seems to have noticed the tremors.
163324: You make your case for a favourable wind to your Father, but there is
no response. Perhaps your prayer is falling on deaf ears, what with all the
noise out here.
163436: You might want to be more specific.
163464: A great booming voice emanates around you, and rocks the church to its
very foundations. "You have friends in fishy places to help you with that!"
Strangely enough, nobody else seems to have noticed the tremors.
163612: "Is my fishing not good enough for you?" says Peter, who overhears your
prayer. You blush.
163680: That sort of thing is beneath you...
163708: You say a prayer for fish, but nothing comes of it.
163744: You hear a fatherly voice in your head. "There is no need for my
intervention. Concentrate hard, and you can do it - all on your own! You have
the power of healing in you. You're not the Son of God for nothing you know!"
163904: You appeal to your God on the issue. There is no answer. Perhaps your
prayer is falling on deaf ears, what with all the noise out here.
164000: A great booming voice emanates around you, and rocks the church to its
very foundations. "ALL FERRETS ARE HEREBY BLESSED!" Strangely enough, nobody
else seems to have noticed the tremors.
164148: You make a fervent request for the continued protection and wellbeing
of ferrets, but your prayer seems to get lost in Father's in tray. Perhaps your
prayer is falling on deaf ears, what with all the noise out here.
164298: A great booming voice emanates around you, and rocks the church to its
very foundations. "I will work on it, Son! But it won't be easy!" Strangely
enough, nobody else seems to have noticed the tremors.
164446: You say a silent prayer, to the effect of bringing peace unto mankind
and protecting it from evil.
164520: A great booming voice emanates around you, and rocks the church to its
very foundations. "BE the change you wish to see in the world, Son!" Strangely
enough, nobody else seems to have noticed the tremors.
164668: Unfortunately, your Father seems to be conveniently engaged elsewhere.
Perhaps your prayer is falling on deaf ears, what with all the noise out here.
164772: A great booming voice emanates around you, and rocks the church to its
very foundations. "YOU IMBECILE!" it roars. "You already have water! DO NOT
WASTE GODLY TIME AGAIN!" Strangely enough, nobody else seems to have noticed
the tremors.
164964: A great booming voice emanates around you, and rocks the church to its
very foundations. "You have healed many, my Son. The suffering of so many
people has been allayed because of you. Accordingly, the path to that which you
seek - namely, loaves of bread - is open!" Strangely enough, nobody else seems
to have noticed the tremors.
165200: A great booming voice emanates around you, and rocks the church to its
very foundations. "And lo! 'Twas written! Five loaves of bread and two fishes
were enough to feed the ravenous crowd of five thousand!" Strangely enough,
nobody else seems to have noticed the tremors.
165392: A great booming voice emanates around you, and rocks the church to its
very foundations. "BREAD?!" it roars. "I, King of the Heavens and the Earth,
who can create universes, spawn life from nothing and see everything in all
Time? And you ask me to BAKE BREAD?! If you want me to do your baking for you,
Son, I suggest you think of others first. Mark my words! One good turn deserves
another! Across the lake, there is a man who is both deaf and mute. He lives at
house number 7 : 31. Cure him, and you will find the path to baked bread!"
Strangely enough, nobody else seems to have noticed the tremors.
165834: You say a silent prayer, arguing your case for God to provide some
bread. Nothing happens.

Perhaps your prayer is falling on deaf ears, what with
all the noise out here.
165960: A great booming voice emanates around you, and rocks the church to its
very foundations. "MAKE THY OWN BREAD, peasant! Oh, it's you, Jesus. Sorry
about that. You will find everything you need to produce some dough, in your
midst! If you need help thereafter, return!" Strangely enough, nobody else
seems to have noticed the tremors.
166208: Your Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be His name, does not respond.
166264: You say a silent prayer, to the effect of bringing peace unto mankind
and protecting it from evil. Unfortunately, your Father seems to be
conveniently engaged elsewhere.
166384: Your Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be His name, does not respond.
