47510: ACT I

Lancaster County, Pennsylvania

You are outside your barn, having
just parked your buggy inside and stabled the horses. You brush the dust off
the brim of your straw hat, loosen two of the hooks of your coat, and stroke
your beard thoughtfully. Your adventurous spirit is tugging at you. Perhaps you
shouldn't return to your home just yet.
47762: Suddenly you realize that you're opposed to the use of electrically
powered appliances such as computers.
47838: PREFACE

Somewhere in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, lies a barn,
constructed by Amish such as yourself, because everyone needs a
barn.

PROLOGUE

You are outside that barn in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania,
doing your normal routine, free from the depravity of the Englisch. But your
adventurous spirit continues to drive your heart to the dangers and perils that
spawn from adventure, and wearing buttons.

INTRODUCTION

In AMISHVILLE, you
play the role of a normal Amish householder, living your life in your hometown
with your fellow Plain People.
