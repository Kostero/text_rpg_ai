45809: You were looking for a birthday present for your niece Isabelle, that
was it. The toy stores along Regent Street were blaring out pop music and the
window displays were garish scenes of animated computer violence. But down a
dim Victorian arcade you came across a different kind of toyshop, with a
peeling rocking-horse behind a grimy window. Perhaps in here, you thought...
46277: "I'm right out of puzzles at the moment," says Catharine.
46656: "Welcome," says the young woman, "My father usually runs the store, but
I'm afraid he isn't here today and I'm looking after the store. My name is
Catharine."
46819: a.
An oak chest stands open
47111: "You are a sweet thing," she says.
47146: You punch her in the face. She screams and falls to the floor. One hand
shielding her cheek, she looks up with frightened eyes at you towering over
her. "I thought -" she starts, and then you want no more of this, and turn to
flee. Your foot catches on the open chest, which wasn't at all where you were
expecting it to be, and you tumble into it. The lid shuts with a reassuringly
final thud.
47480: "But you haven't even tried to solve that puzzle on your own!" exclaims
Catharine. "I think you ought to have a go first, and then if you get stuck,
maybe I can help you."
47618: "You've already solved that," says Catharine. "I don't think you need
any help from me."
47716: "I don't think I should give you any more help with that," says
Catharine. "If I gave the game away, it would only spoil your fun!"
47852: "Good afternoon," says Catharine.
47884: "Looking to leave, already?" says Catharine. "But you only just
arrived!"
47946: "I'm sure that we have just the thing for your niece," says Catharine.
48004: "A lovely shop, isn't it?" says Catharine. "My father and I, we do feel
under pressure to modernise, but we're resisting as much as we can. We feel
that the best puzzles and games are the ones you have to work at; ones which
don't give instant gratification. Yes, I know that's a bit patronising, but
there you are."
48243: "Pleased to meet you," says Catharine, shaking your hand.
48331: You get down on hands and knees to attempt this task, when Catharine
stamps on your hand and you yelp in pain. "I'm sorry," she says. "What are you
doing down there? Have you lost your cuff-link?" You stand up, shame-faced.
48564: You should try picking it up first.
48602: You can't make out much inside the box. Maybe you could just try to
empty it.
48688: Something rattles inside the box.
48726: You give the box a vigourous shake, and you hear a satisfactory rattle.
48798: Catharine opens the chest and roots around inside it. "I wonder if your
niece would like something like this?" she says. "It's quite old, but I think
it still works." She closes the chest and shows you a small cardboard box. She
holds it up to her ear and shakes it. "Sounds like it's all there. It does
require some assembly, though," she adds, and hands the box to you.
49222: You bring the two gadgets together, and after a bit of fiddling you make
them fit, but without you to hold them together they immediately fall apart
again.
49342: You bring the two gadgets together, and they adhere. The resulting
object looks not at all like a car, and quite a lot like a mouse.
49538: "Keep that stuff off me!" says Catharine. "I know it's supposed to be
non-toxic, but you never know with these things, and I'd rather be safe than
sorry."
49693: and in seconds it evaporates. It looks like the description of the
amazing properties of the glue was accurate.
50002: Nothing happens.
50413: "But we're in the middle of a game!" Catharine exclaims.
50610: into the centre square. "Try playing me at noughts and crosses," she
says to you. "But I warn you, I'm unbeatable!"
50868: "You can't play there," Catharine gently admonishes you. "That square's
already occupied."
51073: Use a letter to indicate which edge to draw: "play a", for example.
51129: You're not playing a game at the moment.
51170: Try using a number from one to nine.
51251: "Well done," says Catharine. "You appear to have won. That's definitely
three in a row you have there. And to think that I considered myself
unbeatable! It just goes to show that you can always learn something new about
a game." She tidies the paper away.
51854: "Your move," she says.
51880: "I won!" exclaims Catharine. "You see, I'm unbeatable at noughts and
crosses! But
51952: "It's a draw," says Catharine. "You don't play so badly. But you'll need
to play better than that to beat me!
52156: "Your move," she says.
52199: You're not quite sure why you never noticed the sundial before.
52246: It's a square pedestal of stone, with markings for the hours. The gnomon
52458: apm. On the sundial
52531: You attempt to screw the gnomon into the sundial, but it won't fit.
After some examination, you realise that this is because the screw threads of
the gnomon and the sundial have opposite chirality.
52675: The filed-down gnomon fits into the hole, but the fit isn't good, and it
wobbles. You take it out, dissatisfied with your efforts.
52798: The filed-down gnomon fits into the hole and adheres.
52842: It's the part of a sundial that casts the shadow. Made of metal, there
is a long screw on one end
52916: . The screw thread has been filed off
52992: "You might like to have a go at this problem," says Catharine. She
reaches into a pocket and extracts a strange metal object. "It's a gnomon," she
says, handing it to you. "It's the missing part of that sundial over there. Can
you repair it?"
53224: You place the mushroom on the sundial. As the tip of the shadow falls
across the mushroom, a white door appears in the mushroom's stalk. An inch-high
man in shorts and t-shirt walks through the door and stares up at you, aghast,
before turning on his heels and exiting through the door, which vanishes as
soon as it closes. He left something behind, though.
53475: You can't do that to a shadow.
53538: That seems rather a dangerous thing to attempt.
53578: Futile.
53590: You've already filed down the gnomon.
53622: The disk from the Towers of Hanoi set isn't a particularly good file,
but you make do, and with a lot of effort you manage to file down the gnomon's
screw thread.
53743: A wooden board, bearing three pegs.
54197: It's easier to play with the Towers of Hanoi when they're on the floor.
54262: You should say which peg you want to put it on.
54297: There's only room for the three pegs.
54353: Catharine rummages around in the chest and extracts a large wooden board
on which three pegs are set. Three metal disks, each with a hole in the middle,
are threaded onto the left peg. "This puzzle is called the Towers of Hanoi,"
she says. "The idea is to move the three disks from the left peg to the right
peg in only six moves, without putting a disk on top of a smaller one, and only
picking up the top disk from a peg. Here, have a go."
54901: "You've had your six moves," says Catharine, "and it doesn't look as
though you've managed to move the stack successfully. It's back to the
beginning for you." She collects up the disks and puts them back on the left
peg.
55088: "You don't seem to be getting the hang of this," she says. "Perhaps you
should try a different game."
55170: "The rules are really very simple," she says, "One disk at a time, and
never put a larger disk on a smaller one."
55260: "There's nothing to be gained from cheating like                    
that," she says.
55645: You can only put disks on the peg.
55734: is made of metal, with a very rough surface: it is painful to run your
finger across it. There is a hole in the middle
55825: . It is on

56213: "You can only have one disk at a time," says Catharine.
56511: ," says Catharine, "but putting
56622: Taken.
57245: "But we're in the middle of a game!" Catharine exclaims.
57570: for me. I'll let you start, but since it's an advantage to start, if we
get two boxes apiece then I win. And I warn you, I'm unbeatable."
57853: "You can't play there," Catharine gently admonishes you. "That edge has
already been drawn."
58063: The squares are numbered from 1 to 9, with 1 at the bottom left and 9 at
the top right. To play, type "play o at 1", or just "play 1" for short.
58177: You're not playing a game at the moment.
58235: Try using a letter from A to L.
58309: "You get another move," says Catharine.
59021: "The game is over," says Catharine. "You scored
59162: I won! I told you I was unbeatable! But I'll give you another chance."
She tidies away the finished game and brings out a new piece of paper, and
draws a grid of nine dots on it. "I'll let you start again."
59327: It seems that you won. Well, my. I was sure that Mister Conway said that
my symmetry strategy would never fail. Still, we live and learn." She tidies
away the finished game.
59454: "Your move," she says.
59492: You feel silly talking to the hole.
59539: Pkke es 5nThe hole is dark inside.
59632: . The loaf encounters an obstacle, which you push as far into the hole
as you can.
59708: . The loaf encounters an obstacle, and there is an angry hiss. Alarmed,
you retrieve your bread.
59837: You put the robot mouse into the hole.
59866: Nothing is to be gained by this.
59913: The mouse emits a querulous, unhappy bleep.
59959: The mouse bleeps with annoyance.
59994: The mouse wheels spin, but can't get a good enough grip to move.
60051: The mouse emits a low-pitched bleep.
60090: The mouse just squeezes through the hole, and disappears from view.
Unfortunately you can't very easily talk to it now...
60278: , and then almost looks proud as a magnet cuts out and something metal
drops off the underside of the mouse onto the floor. The lost key is found!
60422: From somewhere inside the hole, you hear a disconsolate bleep.
60828: From somewhere inside the hole, you hear a sharp hiss, and a long
drawn-out high-pitched squeal, and then the robot mouse comes flying out of the
hole at high speed, looking somewhat the worse for wear.
60995: "Ah, I should have explained some things," says Catharine. "There's a
maze inside the wainscot in the form of a four-by-four grid of intersections,
and my key is at the northwest corner. There's a robot cat in the maze too.
When the robot mouse starts at the southeast corner, the robot cat goes to the
northwest corner. Every time you give an instruction to the mouse and it moves
from one intersection to the next, the robot cat moves too. I hope this helps."
61382: "That's a pretty robot mouse you have there," says Catharine. "Looks
like just what I need. You see, I dropped my key through the floorboards from
the attic, and it's fallen into the wainscot somewhere. Perhaps if you could
send the mouse into that mousehole over there, then it could find my key."
61658: Catharine looks at the shadow on the sundial. "It looks like it's
tea-time," she says. "Perhaps you would care to join me in some food?" She
opens the chest, picks up a wicker hamper, and closes the chest again.
61831: You've never really been fond of raw egg.
61862: You're not certain if the egg is raw or cooked, and it would be nice to
find out before you broke it.
61948: The egg wobbles distinctly in your hand; it's clearly raw.
62200: ' kxnbut Catharine leaps backwards to avoid it. "Mind where you point
that thing!" she says.
62361: The already-charged rod explodes! Your hand is somewhat singed.
62411: The rod charges with etherial power, drawn up from the earth through ley
lines...
62487: The egg is still too hot too to hold.
62522: The egg doesn't wobble at all: it's clearly hard-boiled.
62594: Nothing happens.
63093: "But we're in the middle of a game!" Catharine exclaims.
63168: Catharine open the chest and extracts another piece of paper and four
small pieces. The paper has a three-by-three grid of squares on it, like a
noughts and crosses game. Catharine places two pieces at the left and two
pieces at the bottom.

"This is a game called Dodgems," she says. "You have the
pieces at the bottom, and I have the pieces at the left. You can move your
pieces up, left or right, and I can move mine up, down, or right. Your aim is
to get both your pieces off the top of the board before I get mine off the
right hand side."
63827: "You can't move your pieces left off the edge of the board," says
Catharine.
63904: "You can't move your pieces right off the edge of the board," says
Catharine.
63972: "You can't move a piece any more once it's left the board," says
Catharine.
64107: "You're not allowed to move a piece onto another piece," says Catharine.
"There's no capturing in dodgems."
64292: ixn
"You win!" says Catharine. "A splendid performance." She clears away
the paper and the pieces.
64545: Move is losing, considering responses:
64746: Result: MoveScores looks like:
64802: "I'm stuck," says Catharine. "Which means that you lose."
65141: "I win!" she says. "However, I am feeling generous today and I shall
give you another chance." She rearranges the pieces to their starting
positions.
65308: "Oops. I appear to have boxed you in," she says.
65352: "Your move," she says.
65422: "You're not allowed to move your pieces downwards," says Catharine.
65475: a.
An oak chest stands open
65550: There's a little screen and keypad on the side of the chest.
65765: The screen reads "
65792: Input:
65839: Output:
65908: You climb into the chest, which turns out to be full of drapery: large
engulfing folds of cloth. You struggle to be free of them, and pulling the last
one aside, you find yourself walking down a Victorian arcade. Looking around,
you see no sign of the toyshop, but clutched in your hands, you find a wrapped
parcel with a tag saying "To Isabelle, on her birthday." You are unsure of how
you acquired it, but you are somehow sure that Isabelle will enjoy it...
66246: Nothing happens.
66367: screen and a keypad with six keys: "1" to "5" and "send".

"Aha!" says
Catharine, "You've found the combination lock to the chest. You probably won't
get very far with it unless I give you some hints, so here goes.

"Some
combinations are said to generate other combinations according to certain
rules. When you enter a combination, the chest either beeps, or displays the
generated combination on the screen. If a combination generates itself, then
the chest opens."
66715: You can't see any such thing.
66748: The keys are "1" to "5" and "send".
66784: The chest beeps, but your digit doesn't appear on screen. Perhaps you've
reached the limit on the size of input.
66899: You can't see any such thing.
66963: The chest beeps at you.
67016: There's a series of clicks from somewhere inside the chest, and the lid
pops open.
67559: You can't see anything to type on.
67591: Use for example "type 123" to type a string of digits and press "send".
67692: The only numbers on the keypad are "1" to "5".
67794: A fun game for all the family
by Gareth Rees
New players should type
"help"
67876: You can't go that way.
67952: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
67984: As good-looking as ever.
68028: Who knows what might be hidden in the dark rafters and shadowy corners
of this emporium?
68088: You turn to leave, but alarmingly you are unable to find a way out.
68140: She is a young woman, in her late teens perhaps. She is wearing a white
crinoline dress with a hoop skirt, and her long black hair is tied into a
pigtail.
68248: "It's a little trifle, I admit," says Catharine, "but you might like it,
and so might your niece. I don't want to tell you what it is until you've made
it, as that would spoil the surprise".
68388: "I did say it would need some assembly," says Catharine. "Doesn't glue
usually come with these models? I wonder where it's got to?"
68500: The box is very faded, perhaps as a result of lying unpurchased on a
shelf for too many years. You can make out the words "Airfix" and "voice
activated", and a picture of something that might be a model car.
68648: It's a piece of metal, covered on one side with what looks like a piece
of grey carpet. Who knows what it could be for?
68732: It's a piece of metal with four rubber wheels. Who knows what it could
be for?
68788: A little tube with a nozzle on one end. Writing along the side reads
"Super Safe Wonder Glue! Sticks only metal. Completely non-toxic and safe for
all other materials."
68962: Catharine.
68972: "It's such a simple game to master," says Catharine, "that you have no
chance of beating me without cheating."
69068: "The word `chirality' means handedness," says Catharine. "It refers to
the sense in which a spiral coils, clockwise or anticlockwise."
69168: "The only thing stopping you is the screw thread on the gnomon," says
Catharine. "If it weren't for that, it would be easy."
69260: "Can you find a way to reflect the gnomon?" asks Catharine. "Remember, a
reflection in three dimensions is a rotation in four dimensions." She giggles.
69372: "If you can't reflect the screw thread," says Catharaine, "maybe you
could find a way to file down the gnomon so it fits?"
69480: The gnomon casts a shadow across the sundial. The tip of the shadow just
reaches the marking for tea-time.
69556: "The usual solution is recusive," says Catharine. "For example, to move
a stack of three disks from the left peg to the right peg, first move a stack
of two disks to the middle peg, then move the big disk, then move the stack of
two again.
69724: "I said the usual solution is recursive," says Catharine, "but you'll
see if you take the trouble to work it out that three disks take seven moves to
transport. So you'll have to be cleverer than that to move them in six.
69880: "The usual recursive solution is in fact minimal," says Catharine. "So
you'll have to cheat to do better than that."
69968: "If you could move two disks at a time," says Catharine, "it would be
easy, but the rules only allow you to pick up the top disk from a stack."
70100: "Did you never play dots and boxes when you were a child?" asks
Catharine. "Many children play it, but few continue to have any interest in it
when they grow up, which I think is a shame, because it's full of interesting
tricks: struggles for control, sacrifices and lots of game theory."
70316: "I can offer you a few hints about how the cat works," says Catharine.
"First, the cat only moves after the mouse has moved successfully."
70416: "The cat's strategy," says Catharine, "is always to move so as to
minimise the distance between it and the mouse."
70500: "If the cat's strategy doesn't provide a unique move," says Catharine,
"then it moves to the intersection occupied by the mouse at the end of the last
turn, if possible. Otherwise, it chooses randomly among the moves that bring it
closest to the mouse."
70680: "If you think about what I've said," says Catharine, "and play with some
counters on paper, you'll realise that it's just a parity problem. The cat is
always an even number of moves away from the mouse at the end of its turn, and
the cat can always reduce this number if the mouse doesn't retreat."
70892: "Now, if the mouse didn't start an even number of moves away from the
cat," says Catharine, "the game would be a very different thing altogether."
71000: A little hole in the wainscot of the west wall, such as might have been
made by mice.
71060: A little mouse clad in fake grey fur, with four rubber wheels.
71116: Lying where the mouse dropped it is a small brass-coloured key.
71160: Brass is of course a non-magnetic copper-zinc alloy, so presumably this
key also contains iron.
71232: "This isn't really a puzzle," says Catharine. "It's just tea-time. If
you want to make a puzzle out of it, try eating the egg."
71328: Catharine says, "If you haven't played Infocom's wonderful game
`Trinity' by Brian Moriarty, you're going to have problems with this puzzle."
71436: "In the game `Trinity'," says Catharine, "part of the action takes place
on the surface of a giant sundial covered with mushrooms, each mushroom
representing a mushroom cloud from the explosion of an atomic bomb."
71588: "The shadow from the gnomon was important too," says Catharine. "When it
touched a mushroom, magical things would happen."
71680: Catharine says, "You need to have played Graham Nelson's marvellous game
`Curses' too, or else you'll struggle."
71768: "In the game `Curses'," says Catharine, "There are a number of magic
wands that can be charged by striking and discharged by pointing them at
things."
71888: A wicker picnic hamper.
71908: A long, thin loaf of French bread.
71940: A featureless mahogany rod, whose purpose is oblique. It is about the
size of a matchstick.
72024: "Dodgems was invented by mathematician Colin Vout," says Catharine.
"It's one of the more interesting games that can be played on a noughts and
crosses board."
72140: "I can't offer you much in the way of strategy," says Catharine, "except
that it isn't always wise to move a piece off the board when it can be blocking
your opponent's pieces instead."
72272: "A final hint," says Catharine. "The northeast corner of the board is a
good square to aim for."
72506: plus 1. For example, the number 12345 generates the number 2346."
72652: , but with its first digit removed. For example, since we know that 123
generates 24, then 2123 generates 4."
72930: repeated. For example, since 123 generates 24, then 4123 generates
2424."
73052: generates the reversal of Y. For example, since 1234 generates 235, then
51234 generates 532."
