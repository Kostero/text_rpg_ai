38852: That would be less than courteous.

38905: Is that the best you can think of?
38934: That's not a direction.
38953: Not that way you can't.
38981: Keep your hands to yourself.
39002: You achieve nothing by this.
39032: Futile.
39039: You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.
39087: You talk to yourself a while.
39110: This provokes no reaction.
39137: There is no reply.
39156: Nothing is on sale.
39175: Your singing is abominable.
39201: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
39238: Time passes.
39253: You aren't feeling especially drowsy.
39331: You blink your eyes as the blaring alarm jars you into waking reality.
You come to the sad realization that it was all a dream. The well-endowed
Priness Zomar ceases to be and your bulging pecs have been replaced by the
reality that is your huge beer gut.
39515: Your bedroom is a nicely orchestrated mess. Clothes and furniture are
strewn about in an almost artistic fashion. Salividor Dali would proud, if you
had any idea who he was. Right next to the unmade bed is a tiny, wooden
dresser. The only exit is to the south.
39707: You would love to return to the loving embrace of Princess Zomar, but
there is much to do today.
39787: You hear...
39809: You wobble a bit as you try to maintain balance on two feet. The raging
hangover tells you that you were really knocking 'em down last night
39915: It is against your principles to make that bed.
39960: That would require acrobatics far beyond your capacity.
40012: Oh, God! How cliche! "Look under the bed." Can there be just one bed in
any text adventure that doesn't contain important items underneath? Apparently
not. You find a baseball bat.
40148: Don't push your luck, pal!
40179: It's just a tiny bedside dresser with one drawer. It has a faint
chemical odor you can't quite place.
40252: It's just a tiny bedside dresser with one drawer. It has a faint odor of
model airplane glue.
40322: You begin to calm down.
40354: It's wedged shut.
40384: You wedge the screwdriver in and try to pry it open. There is a snap and
the screwdriver breaks apart in your hand. You jump up and down, screaming and
cursing. Your blood is really boiling over the culmination of the day's rotten
events. You feel ready to grab a rifle and head out to the nearest tower.
40625: The bat splinters into a thousand pieces. Apparently, the dresser is
made out of a harder wood than the bat.
40717: You're far too calm and level-headed to do something as destructive as
that.
40772: One order of fire wood, coming right up. Although by the time you finish
with the dresser, all that remains is useless pile of splinters. You raise the
axe over your head in triumphant glee, shouting a bacchanalian victory chant.
You look up and see Barbara the door staring at you. She rolls her eyes, lets
out a soft sigh, and walks off.
41030: You can't quite place the odor, but the fumes make you dizzy.
41075: Model airplane glue. Somebody has effectively glued this drawer shut.
You have a good idea just who.
41162: No. You would get slivers in your fingers and hands. That would hurt.
41213: You pull out a copy of the Holy Bible.
41252: That probably isn't a good idea.
41287: You open it up to find it hollowed out. It's your secret compartment for
hiding things like money. It's the one place that Tony would never, ever dream
of looking.
41414: You struggle to refrain from laughing at the sight of Tony falling for
the oldest trick in the book.
41497: Tony looks up and sees the coin. He drops what he's doing and tries to
pick it up. He has no success but that makes him try all the harder.
41624: You yank and pull, but the coin doesn't budge. It looks like it's stuck
there for good.
41702: Giggling impishly, you glue the coin permantly to the ground. You stand
up and do your best to act casual.
41800: A nagging doubt lurks at the back of your mind. Wouldn't there be a
better place to glue the coin?
41879: You feel a jolt of electricy zap you. This thing is really going
haywire.
41939: Click. Nothing seems to happen. The snooze button appears to be broken.
42011: One swing of the bat effectively shatters the alarm into smithereens.
You hear the voice of your wife, Barbara, from down the hall. "I hope you just
didn't smash the alarm clock with a baseball bat."

   With the ringing gone
from your ears you can finally think straight. You remember that the big Spike
Tyler-Ethan Holigram Boxing Match is on later today. And the only place to
watch that is at Phil's bar under the heavy influence of alcohol. Well, it
looks like you have a busy day ahead of you. But first you need to find your
car keys and rid yourself of this nasty hangover. Get to it!
42442: "BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP"
42479: You share Babe Ruth's physique, but not his swing.
42591: A thorough search is impossible with the room in this state.
42639: You can hardly hear yourself think with that racket going on. The music
echoes of the walls so it is impossible to trace in to any specific source.
42761: What? With your own two hands? Surely you could find some other sucker
to tackle this chore.
42828: With the aid of your broom and dustpan, you manage to find a room in all
this mess.
42906: You've picked up enough around here.
42943: The coating of dried glue protects the stereo from your feeble blows.
42996: The stereo has been glued to the desk.
43030: You wonder if Raffi was meant to be played at that volume.
43077: Are you deaf?
43095: None of the knobs turn. They've been well glued.
43140: The volume has been glued stuck.
43175: There is only so much cleaning you're willing to do.
43224: You find money, gold, jewels, riches, and treasures far beyond your
wildest dreams. In fact, the treasures ARE your wildest dreams. I've had it up
to here with the "look under the bed" routine. Trust me, you will effectively
solve this game without having to look under any more beds.
43433: Aaaaauuuuuuugggghhh!!!!!!
43463: You drink the screwdriver in one gulp. Aaaahhhhh! That hit the spot.
That is, until you realize that it was the wrong kind of screwdriver. The tool
gets stuck in your throat and you are rushed into the emergency room for a
quick operation. You miss the boxing match, but it isn't all bad. You've
provided the hospital with a very good laugh.
43715: Before your common sense kicks in and prevents you from doing such a
foolish act, you put the end of the tube into your mouth and squeeze. At the
hospital, the doctors inject acetone to dissolve the glue. Unfortunately, all
of this provides you with a mild case of poinsoning and you miss the boxing
match.

Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time.
43978: The tube is too tiny to handle with the oven mitts on.
44017: Glue spurts out all over your fingers.
44069: The fumes make you dizzy. The toluenes from the glue swim through your
bloodstream in a mission to destroy your brain cells. They reach their
destination only to find no brain cells left to destroy. Discouraged, they go
home.
44230: The fumes make you dizzy.
44263: The tube seems stuck you your fungers.
44301: The bathroom smells strongly of soap. Blue and green tiles cover the
floor. A bath, toilet, and sink are wedged into this tiny place. Above the sink
is a medicine cabinet which is closed.
44441: The bathroom smells strongly of soap. Blue and green tiles cover the
floor. A bath, toilet, and sink are wedged into this tiny place. Above the sink
is a medicine cabinet which is open.
44574: It is a bottle of Painaway pills.
44605: Unfortunately, the bottle is closed.
44636: Unfortunately, the bottle is open.
44671: You struggle in vain. You never could figure out those child-proof caps.
44733: Your headache vanishes. Now you feel fit enough to drink some more beer.
44805: Barbara shouts out, "For God's sake, put some clothes on."
44858: The plaid curtains are very tacky.
44890: They've been opened up to allow the sun to shine through.
44939: You open the curtains, allowing sunlight to fill the room. Barbara is
too engrossed in her show to notice.
45039: It's no time for dilly-dallying. You've got a busy day ahead of you.
45099: You give her a gentle peck on the cheek. She glares at you, wondering if
you have done something wrong.
45177: Who do you think you are? O.J. Simpson?
45237: "You know I could never figure those things out."
45316: "I think I know where they are. I'll look for them when my show is over.
45377: "I told you never to call me that."
45413: "That lemon? I don't know why you are so passionate about that piece of
junk."
45480: "I always liked it."
45505: "He's out back, I think."
45536: "I'm your wife, remember?"
45568: "You're not watching that thing here!"
45622: for the day. If you want to watch your stupid boxing match, go someplace
else."
45700: "It's my favorite show. It watch it everyday without fail."
45751: "Your one true love."
45779: "What about the remote control? You're not getting it. That's for damn
sure."
45878: "I'm not going anywhere."
45928: Barbara gets up and vanishes. She returns with a broom and dustpan. She
hands them to you and resumes her show.
46007: "You're on thin ice, buster!"
46120: V.
46132: The cord has been burnt through.
46157: The cord attaches the television set to the wall.
46200: Sunlight shines upon it.
46229: The cord is securly fastened to the wall.
46279: You hold the magnifying glass over the cord. It seems to be taking
forever to burn.
46419: huts off. Barbra asks you, "Is there any particular reason why you just
ruined our television set?"

Uh oh. She sounds mad this time.
46539: The television seems to shut off for some reason.
46574: This television set, a 13" Nadir brand, sits crookedly on a shabby
formica stand. This set is your pride and joy, right alongside your wife and
child. (Well, maybe not your child.) It is currently showing "All My Traumas",
Barbara's favorite show. A cord extends from the set and is connected to a
wall.
46802: There are no controls on the set.
46835: Best leave her alone. You've done enough damage for one day.
46890: Bad idea. Barbara was already incensed enough. Calling her "Babs", the
moniker she has always loathed, has pushed her over the brink. The veins bulge
in her neck and eyes turn an eeire shade of crimson before she finally
explodes. I will spare you the grisly details of what follows. Let's just say
it takes the proctologist five hours to remove television set.
47174: "Is that what this is about? Your stupid keys? For the love of God..."
She gets up and disappears. She returns with the car keys and throws them at
you. She then picks up the phone and calls the television repairman to come
repair the damage you just did. Screaming various nasty comments about your
parents, Barbara sits back down in a huff.
47426: Barbara seems a bit too miffed for idle chatter.
47466: Barbara seems a bit too miffed for idle chatter.
47508: Trust me. Now is not the time to order her about.
47555: Handling this oven has been forbidden to you.
47595: You must think you're playing Hitchhiker's or something.
47647: The grass is firmly rooted. It won't budge.
47685: Dr. Livingston couldn't hack his way though that thicket.
47735: Tony sits next to an anthill, frying ants with a magnifying glass.
47796: He takes one look at you and breaks out in a fit of uncontrollable
laughter.
47857: Tony is doubling over with laughter.
47886: Tony is your precocious eight-year-old son. His hobbies include model
airplanes, vandalism, and getting suspended from school. Besides that, he plays
a mean game of Whist.
48016: He is currently doubling over with laughter.
48049: He is currently frying ants with a magnifying glass.
48097: Tony is too busy laughing to pay any attention to you.
48141: He winces as you show your fatherly affection.
48178: Tempting. Very tempting.
48224: Tony feigns disinterest.
48246: Tony feigns interest.
48278: He takes the bottle and opens it with effortless ease. He hands it back
to you with a smile.
48346: kdibk q."Got tired of hiding it under your bed, eh?" he chuckles as he
takes the bat and throws it out into the thick grass.
48444: "Cool. Thanks, Dad."
48474: He accepts your gift saying, "I'll find your secret hiding place
someday."
48532: "I have no use for that."
48563: "Get your own!"
48704: "How old do you think I am? Sheesh!"
48743: "Whatever it is, I didn't do it."
48780: "You're good for a laugh."
48812: "I dunno. I didn't take them this time."
48845: "I'm bored with your questions. You go now."
48887: "I like it here. Methinks I'll stay."
48928: Tony chuckles for a moment. "You're hilarious, Dad!"
48971: Tony shrugs and goes back to ignoring you.
49013: The ants shrivel from the heat. Tony cackles insanely at this.
49058: The ants are no doubt relieved that Tony has moved on to other things.
49115: You grab a handful of ants. They bite you until your drop them.
49174: The ants burn to a crisp. Hey, this IS fun! No wonder the boy seemed so
enthused.
49248: He swings it away from you. "Get your own," he says.
49294: Tony is to engrossed in the coin to pay you any mind.
49339: Right. You strain your back picking up pixie sticks.
49383: Barbara has forbidden you from touching this machine.
49430: Please don't do that.
49457: You can't. You're too attached to them. Literally. You're clothes have
somehow affixed themselves to your body. Imagine that.
49564: A couple of moths flit away as you collect your clothes. However did
they survive being run through the washing machine?
49659: You put on your tattered and mildewy clothes.
49710: As you obscure your puny naughty bits, Tony stops giggling. He brushes a
tear from his eye and goes back to his ant frying.
49807: You must think you're still dreaming. Notice that the rippling pectorals
have disappeared.
49882: Hey, genius! You do have to be inside to start the car.
49930: These type of vehicles usually require keys to operate. And since you
don't know how to hotwire...
50001: Off you go...
50031: Don't pick at it. You get a lot more respect driving around in a red
car.
50091: You hear a shriek. People flee in mortal terror. Parents grab their
crying children and seek refuge inside their home. Eventually, it dawns upon
you that you are stark naked. You titter a bit at your predicament. The police,
however, don't share your sense of humor. You're charged with Indecent
Exposure, and Conspiracy to Commit Genocide. The good news is that the charges
were dropped.

The evidence wouldn't hold up in court.

(drum fill)
50422: You doubt it will support your weight.
50465: You give it a few good whacks. It will still take a looooong time before
you chop this thing down.
50534: You might as well try to cut it down with a herring.
50979: (type "memo" for author's comments)
51010: Heads fly and body parts soar through the air as you swing your mighty
sword at the horde of evil barbarians. One by one, the minions of the evil
overlord Kroz persishes from the wrath of your unforgiving blade. As the last
of them collapse in a bloody heap at your feat. You raise your arms and shout
out in victory. Princess Zomar rushes up to your side and caresses your bulging
pectorals.
  "Thank you, mighty one, for rescuing me from a fate worse than
death," she says in a breathy voice.
  "Say no more," you respond. "It was not
just my duty. It was my privilege."
51423: "You are wounded," she gasps as she sees the cuts along your rippling
biceps. "I must annoint them with various balms and ointments. I need to gather
the magic healing lotion and rub it ever so thoroughly all over your body. But
first, I must dress the wounds. Please forgive me, for I have nothing to dress
them with apart from my sheer silk nightgown."
  With that, she starts ripping
off large shreds of her gown and gingerly wraps them around the wounds, taking
time to slide her hands over your body. She leans towards you ear, brushing her
large billowy breasts against your shoulder, and whispers, "BEEP BEEP BEEP
BEEP"
51886: Oooooooo. Better watch it with that profanity. You wouldn't want to
offend anybody with such vulgar talk.
51966: That's the spirit!
51982: Bear with me. I just haven't gotten around to implementing a scoring
system yet. I'll do it in the completed game. Promise.
52079: The fact that you've never won a fight in your life prevents you from
doing this.
52136: You love to smash things, but somebody might need that later.
52187: That would be difficult without any glue.
52218: You've learned from experience that you have to be more careful than
that when dealing with glue. Last time you fooled around with it you were stuck
to the cat for a year.
52338: You really should reconsider that.
52650: om. Feel free to drop me a line if you're stuck or (God forbid) have any
typos to report. You can also tell me how to type the 'at' symbol without
causing an error during compilation. How's a guy to print his E-Mail address
correctly? Thank you.
52830: Hhhmmmmmm. You may want to be a tad more specific.

53792: You can't go that way.
53868: It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
53900: As good-looking as ever.
53944: You hear Barbara's voice come from down the hall. "You're not stepping
one foot out of that room until you turn off that damn alarm clock."
54044: I wasn't lying, you know. The only exit is to the south.
54088: This bed has been the basis of a life-long argument between you and your
wife, Barbara. She insists that it should be made every morning. You believe
that daily ritual is a futile gesture because, after all, it will just get
"unmade" again later that night.
54268: A pile of splinters sit where the dresser used to be.
54308: It's a small pile are sharp, pointy wooden slivers.
54348: Embossed on the cover are the words, "Salvation lay within!" How true
those words are.
54436: is on one side. Somebody has drilled a tiny hole through his head.
54484: An alarm on the dresser is screeching.
54512: It's a piece of junk. It doesn't even display the time since your son,
Tony, ripped the hands off. Although for such a small device, it produces one
hell of a noise. There is a snooze button on top.
54656: This bat belongs to Tony, your son. You confiscated it from him when he
had taken to smashing mailboxes with it.
54736: A short hallway extends from here to the east. Your room is to the
north. The hellhole that is Tony's room is to the west. Loud music blares from
that direction. There is a bathroom to the south.
54876: You take one step in, but find yourself having to flee in agony. There's
no way you can handle that loud music with the headache you've got.
54976: This room is such an unholy mess, it boggles the mind that anybody could
possibly live in it. Loud music pours from some unseen source. Nothing
productive can be done here with room in this state. It really defies
description. You can flee this evil place to the east.
55164: There is no escape...except to the east.
55196: Tony's room is still a veritable mess, but at least now one can function
it it. Clothes, toys, and debris litter the soiled carpet. A rumpled bed sits
in one corner. Against the opposite wall is a medium-sized desk. The only exit
is to the east.
55372: The place is still a mess, but you've clean up as much as you care to.
55424: Music blares from a stereo sitting on the desk.
55460: It emits very loud music. (If you can call what that kid listens to
"music".) The knobs appear to have been coated with some sort of glue.
55560: Unmade, just like yours. You taught your son well.
55600: Your missing screwdriver. You wondered what happened to it.
55644: It's a tube of glue used for model airplanes. The boy has apparently
been very busy with it. It's nearly empty.
55724: It's a tube of glue used for model airplanes. It's currently empty.
55776: Kitsch is the word to describe the tasteless decor of the living room.
The walls are painted with garish pastels and the curtains are a bright plaid.
Plastic covers all the furniture. A hallway heads to the west. There is an
archway on the northwall that leads into the kitchen. You can leave the house
to the south. A television set sits in the center of the room.
56032: All the furniture is decorated with a floral pattern and is covered with
plastic.
56088: Your wife, Barbara, sits on the sofa watching some show on television.
56140: Barbara is lovely and (in order to survive life with you) very patient.
Her attire matches the gaudy decor of the living room perfectly. The day
Barbara dies, polyster stock prices will plummet.
56276: This shabby formica stand wobbles slightly under the weight of the
television set.
56332: It's here somewhere.
56348: Sunlight fills the room.
56368: Barbara, seated on the sofa, is staring at you. She looks mad.
56416: If looks could kill....
56436: You can't see any such thing.
56460: The walls, floor, and appliances of this kitchen are all various shades
of off-white, creating a slight disorientating effect. The ceiling above the
oven has been smoked black due to a small number of cooking mishaps, all of
them having occured when Barbara made the mistake of letting you cook. A
refrigerator is nest to the door to the garage, which goes southeast. You can
either pass south through an archway to the living room or go outside to the
north.
56776: You can't imagine a more depressing sight.
56808: The back yard hasn't been mowed in quite some time. The grass is thick
enough for even the most intrepid explorers to get lost in. A brick patio near
the back door (which you are standing on) provides some refuge from the
greenery. You can enter the house to the south.
56996: Better stay on the patio. Who knows what is living in there?
57040: Bricks have been neatly laid here to form a patio, providing an oasis of
sorts amid the thick grass that surrounds you.
57124: The back yard is choked with weeds and tall grass.
57160: Tony is trying to pick up the fifty-cent piece.
57196: Tony is your precocious eight-year-old son. His hobbies include model
airplanes, vandalism, and getting suspended from school. Besides that, he plays
a mean game of Whist. He is currently trying to pick up the fifty-cent piece
you glued to the ground.
57376: The garage smells strongly of exhaust fumes. The walls are painted with
oil and grease. Not the cleanest of garages, but it has always provided your
precious vehicle with sweet, sweet sanctuary. A door to the northwest goes back
into the house, or you can go outside by heading due south.
57576: The less said about them, the better.
57604: One stylin' dude.
57620: Your beautiful red car sits in the middle of the garage.
57660: It's an Edsel. She's been clunky throughout the years, but you kept 'er
going. The red paint has peeled in some spots revealing a grey coat underneath.
57768: It's has peeled in some spots revealing the original grey coat
underneath.
57820: This ring of keys holds the key to start your car.
58182: . Your father would call it "The Family Tree". It has been a source of
pride for generations. You can walk through the front door to the north or
enter the garage that's northeast of here.
58316: It's way too far to walk. Better take the car.
58352: Your father told you that this tree symbolizes pride. Actually, you've
always thought it a bit of an eyesore.
58432: Embedded in "The Family Tree" is an axe. You've been trying to chop that
tree down. (It looks ugly.)
58508: You're wearing your birthday suit. For the unenlightened, that means
you're naked.
