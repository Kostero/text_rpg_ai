24364: You're around here somewhere...
24387: You find it.
24400: You have it.
24424: It's right here.

28336: Bad luck, huh?
28353: Congratulations. It's not easy to be killed while already dead.
28447: You clearly are a suicidal maniac. Your remains will be put in Hades for
your fellow adventurers to gloat over.
28604: . Your senses are disturbed. Objects around you appear indistinct,
bleached of color, even unreal.
28690: Well, you probably deserve another chance. I can't quite fix you up
completely, but you can't have everything.
28958: The draft blows you back.
29006: Attacks are vain in your condition.
29054: Such action is beyond your capabilities.

29211: You are dead.
29275: Although there is no light, the room seems dimly illuminated.
29343: The sound of a distant trumpet is heard. You find yourself in the woods,
rising as if from a long sleep. A breeze rustles the treetops; then, all is
still.
29449: Your prayers are not heard.
29514: Your hand passes through it.
29561: The thief doesn't let you near.

30421: You seem to be repeating yourself.
30444: Nothing happens here.
30527: The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the
earth. Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is
tempered by its fear of light.
30634: One is probably lurking in the dark nearby. Don't let your light go out!
30707: Auto-cannibalism is not the answer.
30752: How romantic!
30771: Your image in the mirror looks tired.
30794: Are your eyes prehensile?
30828: Not a chance.

32504: It will be taken over the thief's dead body.
32609: Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against the wall. It is
clear that the bag will be taken only over his dead body.
32860: A "lean and hungry" gentleman just wandered through, carrying a large
bag.

36971: It's latched from above.
36997: The door latches shut.

east. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.

37210: Some paint chips away, revealing more paint.
37248: Don't be a vandal!

37344: The troll laughs at your puny gesture.

attraction. There are exits to the northeast and west, and a scramble down. The

reservoir. Water is pouring over the top of the abandoned dam

38374: Click.
38411: The boat inflates and appears seaworthy.
38438: A tan label is lying inside the boat.
38475: You haven't enough lung power.
38553: Read the tan label!
38641: Inflating it further might burst it.
38676: You're in it!
38701: The boat deflates.
38770: The cliff is unclimbable.
38795: You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling of
another room below. A wooden railing protects you from a precipitous drop.
38875: A rope hangs from the rail and ends about ten feet from the floor below.
38929: As you enter, a strong pull as if from a wind draws you over the railing
and down.
39006: This is a large domed temple.
39027: A piece of rope descends from the railing of the dome, about 20 feet
above, ending some five feet above your head.
39092: On the east wall is an ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a
long-forgotten language. Below the prayer, a stair leads down. The temple's
altar is to the south. In the center of the room sits a white marble pedestal.

39245: The water evaporates before it gets close.
39280: You nearly burn your hand trying to extinguish the flame.
39325: Ding, dong.
39357: The rainbow solidifies and is now walkable (the stairs and bannister are
the giveaway).
39416: A shimmering pot of gold appears at the end of the rainbow.
39462: The rainbow has become somewhat run-of-the-mill.
39491: Dazzling colors briefly emanate from the sceptre.
39550: The book is already open.
39567: Oddly, the book cannot be closed.
39602: Beside page 569, there is only one page with legible printing. It seems
to be about the banishment of evil using certain noises, lights, and prayers.
39721: Alas, there's not enough candle left to burn.
39793: With what?
39839: The torch's heat vaporizes the candles.

40009: Cnmhnburning.
40064: A gust of wind blows out your candles!
40151: You are outside a large gate inscribed, "Abandon hope all ye who enter
here!" The gate is open; beyond you can see a desolation, with a pile of
mangled bodies in one corner. Thousands of voices, lamenting some hideous fate,
can be heard.
40304: The gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your attempts to pass.
40396: You're not equipped for an exorcism.
40445: A deep peal issues from the bell. The wraiths stop jeering and an
expression of long-forgotten terror takes shape on their ashen faces.
40552: In your confusion, the candles drop to the ground (and they are out).
40620: The prayer reverberates in a deafening confusion. As the last word
fades, a heart-stopping scream fills the cavern, and the spirits, sensing a
greater power, flee through the walls.
40777: The flames flicker wildly and the earth trembles beneath your feet. The
spirits cower at your unearthly power.
40857: The gate is protected by an invisible force. It makes your teeth ache to
touch it.
40914: The spirits jeer loudly and ignore you.
40999: The tension of this ceremony is broken, and the wraiths, amused but
shaken at your clumsy attempt, resume their hideous jeering.
41098: Yuk!
41146: As you take the buoy, you notice something odd about the feel of it.
41232: You spot a scarab in the sand.
41266: You are near the top of Aragain Falls. The only path leads north. A
41368: Read the tan label!
41385: The current sweeps it away.
41444: The river is wide and dangerous, with swift currents and hidden rocks.
You decide to forgo your swim.
41556: The current carries you downstream.
41673: You are on what used to be a large lake, but which is now a large mud
pile. There are "shores" to the north and south.
41729: You are on the lake with beaches to the north and south and a dam to the
east.
41795: The lake's gone...
41872: . A slimy stairway climbs to the north.
41988: You are in a small room with exits to the east and south.
42047: In the corner of the ceiling, a large vampire bat is holding his nose.
42088: A large vampire bat swoops down at you!
42184: The bat grabs you and lifts you away...
42234: Fweep!
42288: The basket is raised to the top of the shaft.
42338: The basket is lowered to the bottom of the shaft.
42396: The chain is secure.
42500: There is too much gas to blow away.
42525: It smells like coal gas in here.
42624: This is a chilly room whose sole exit is to the north. In one corner is
a machine, reminiscent of a clothes dryer, with a switch labelled "START". The
switch does not appear to be manipulable by any human hand (unless the fingers
are about 1/16 by 1/4 inch). The machine has a large lid, which is
42896: The machine produces a dazzling display of colored lights and bizarre
noises. A moment later, the excitement abates.
42990: The insubstantial slag crumbles at your touch.
43039: As you touch the rusty knife, your sword gives a single pulse of
blinding blue light.
43163: A ghost appears, appalled at your desecration of the remains of a fellow
adventurer. He curses your valuables and banishes them to Hades. The ghost
leaves, muttering obscenities.
43290: You are in a room off the maze, which lies to the southwest. Above you
is a
43445: Locked.

43772: The cyclops yawns and stares at the thing that woke him up.
43876: The cyclops says, "Yum, that made me thirsty. Perhaps I could drink the
blood of that thing." It appears that YOU are "that thing."
44083: AT hungry.
44094: The cyclops won't eat THAT!
44135: "Do you think I'm as stupid as my father was?", he says, dodging.
44191: The cyclops ignores your pitiful attempt.
44218: You cannot tie him, though he is fit to be tied.
44249: You can hear his stomach rumbling.
44275: The east wall has a cyclops-sized opening in it.
44306: The cyclops sleeps blissfully at the foot of the stairs.
44342: A hungry cyclops blocks the staircase. From the bloodstains on the
walls, you gather that he is not very friendly, though he likes people.
44431: eyeing you closely. I don't think he likes you very much. He looks
extremely hungry, even for a cyclops.
44499: The cyclops, having eaten the hot peppers, appears to be gasping. His
enflamed tongue protrudes from his man-sized mouth.
44722: You hear a scream of anguish as the robber rushes to defend his
hideaway.
44774: Huh?
44786: You have entered a stone barrow. The door closes behind you, leaving you
in darkness, but ahead is a brightly-lit cavern. Floating in the cavern is a
large sign: "You have completed a great and perilous adventure which has tested
your wit and courage. You have mastered the first part of the ZORK trilogy.
Prepare yourself for an even greater test!"

The ZORK trilogy continues with
"ZORK II: The Wizard of Frobozz" and "ZORK III: The Dungeon Master."
45062: You haven't a prayer of getting the coffin down there.
45094: You have entered the Land of the Living Dead. Thousands of lost souls
can be heard weeping and moaning. In a corner are the remains of previous
adventurers less fortunate than yourself. A passage exits to the north.
45216: An old leather bag, bulging with coins, is here.
45250: Nothing happens.
45264: Paths lead into the forest to the west and northwest. Also, a
well-marked path extends east.
45318: "Flood Control Dam #3 was constructed in 783 GUE with a grant of 37
million zorkmids from Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive. This impressive
structure is composed of 370,000 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall and
193 feet wide.

The construction of FCD#3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
dedication. It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave drivers, and 12
engineers, 2345 bureaucrats, and nearly one million dead trees.

As you start
your tour, notice the more interesting features of FCD#3. On your right...
45674: Oh, no! You have walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking grue!
45718: On the ground is a pile of leaves.
45738: At the end of the rainbow is a pot of gold.
45760: With great effort, you open the window enough to allow entry.
45796: On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.
45838: On the far wall is a painting of unparalleled beauty.
45872: On the altar is a large black book, open to page 569.
45906: On the two ends of the altar are burning candles.
45936: At the east end of this narrow passage, a ladder leads upward. There's a
strong draft from the west, where the passage narrows even further.
46044: You must perform the ceremony.
46064: That would be a good trick.
46080: The axe crashes against the rock, throwing sparks!
46108: The axe blade nicks your side. Ouch!
46130: An axe stroke makes a deep wound in your leg.
46160: A hot pepper sandwich is here.
46184: What a concept!
46204: This is a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.
46236: This is the attic. The only exit is the stairway down.
46266: This was once an artist's studio. The walls are splattered with paints
of 69 different colors. To the west is a doorway (also covered with paint). A
dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace; although you might be able
to get up it, it seems unlikely you could get back down.
46432: This is a small room with passages to the east, northeast and south, and
a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by
an axe) mar the walls.
46524: This is a circular room with passages in all directions. Several have
unfortunately been blocked by cave-ins.
46590: This was the maintenance room for Flood Control Dam #3. Apparently, the
room has been ransacked, for most of the valuable equipment is gone. On one
wall is a group of buttons colored yellow, brown, and red. The only doorway is
southwest.
46728: This looks like an Egyptian tomb. A stair ascends to the west.
46766: The candles grow shorter.
46778: The candles are becoming quite short.
46798: The candles won't last long now.
46812: This is a crooked corridor from the north, with forks to the southwest
and south.
46848: This is a tiny cave with entrances west and north, and a dark,
forbidding staircase leading down.
46894: This is a sand-filled cave whose exit is to the southwest.
46924: This small chamber appears to have been part of a coal mine. To the west
and south are passages, and a steep metal slide twists downward.
46996: This room smells strongly of coal gas. Narrow tunnels lead lead east and
south.
47040: This is a nondescript part of a coal mine.
47066: This is a small room at the bottom of a long shaft. A heavy iron chain
hangs down the shaft. To the south is a passageway and to the east a very
narrow passage.
47150: This is part of a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
47188: The cyclops won't let you past.
47200: The cyclops, tired of your trickery, grabs you firmly. "Mmm. Just like
Mom used to make 'em."
47258: A valiant attempt.
47272: The door is boarded and you can't remove the boards.
47302: The door is nailed shut.
47316: The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into
darkness.
47356: The door swings shut.
47368: The dam blocks your way.
47382: The deceased adventurer's useless lantern is here.
47414: The engravings translate to "This space intentionally left blank."
47460: You should have looked before you leaped.
47484: The flat of the troll's axe skins across your forearm.
47516: You seem to be digging a hole here.
47536: Failed.
47544: You try to ascend the ramp, but slide back down.
47572: A voice booms from the darkness, "Your disrespect costs you your life!"
47610: The grating is closed.
47618: The grating opens.
47626: The grating closes.
47642: The hole collapses, smothering you.
47666: The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it.
47692: Look around you.
47716: Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.
47744: You would drown.
47756: Beside the skeleton is a rusty knife.
47782: The knife, moving with its own force, slowly turns your hand, until the
blade is at your neck. The knife seems to sing as it savagely slits your
