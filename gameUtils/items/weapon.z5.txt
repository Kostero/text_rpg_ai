 Advancing the sequence (3 hint topics)
 After examining everything, TOUCH NOTCH.
 Apparently this device was intended to have one being hold the rods together
while the other activated the system.
 Are you sure you checked out all of the studs?
 But it's not clear how to finish the sequence.
 But you don't have enough time to both look at it and turn it off.
 By touching the sequence stud.
 CHERYL, UNLOCK CUFFS.
 Can you find a way to make the probe and the transmission 'interact'?
 Can you get Cheryl to look somewhere else?
 Cansw
 Chat
 Check out all the studs you've never used.
 Cheryl
 Cheryl won't pull the rods for you.
 Cheryl's monitor hologram shows some sort of response to the probe on the
contact points. It would help if you could take a closer look.
 Cheryl's presence makes doing so problematic.

 If Cheryl can make the probe work, you certainly can.
 If you could distract her for a moment or two...
 If you did everything else in the last section, it's time to view the sequence
of necessary activities to bring Yi-Lono-Mordel online.
 If you're having touble with the timing, read the next hint.
 Ignition
 Ignition System (3 topics)
 Is there anything else electromagnetic that she can see but doesn't care
about?
 Is there some way to make it so Cheryl can't see the screen?
 It resonates when probed.
 It sounds like it should react if your body touches it.
 It uses magnetic fields, and the probe generates some sort of electromagnetic
radiation.
 It's a probe. You need to probe what's wrong. Use the probe on the problem
area.
 It's quite unlike the Yi, so you may not have thought of this, but have you
tried manipulating them physically?
 It's the first three studs listed when you examine the grid, in order.
 LOCK CUFFS. PUT CUFFS ON RODS.
 Loc
 Look at the hint topic 'determining the sequence'.
 Maybe you can give Cheryl a reason to leave the goggles on for a bit longer.
 Maybe you could move the probe closer to the transmission?

 Now that the handcuffs are off, getting Cheryl on the other side of a
forcefield would be a great idea.
 Now what do I do? (1 answer)
 Ok, I fixed it. How do I turn it on? (1 answer)
 Ok, now there's a pillar, with a suspicious panel. What about that panel?
 Ok, so the power stud doesn't work. But there's a generator access stud.
 Once the indicator icon starts flashing, it's time.

 She doesn't want you getting any closer to her.
 She will see it. You need to make her not care about it.
 She's curious about what you've been doing.
 Some of the control studs aren't really useful just yet.

 Take off the handcuffs, and put them on the rods.
 That helps. You can turn off the display by activating the sequence stud
again.
 That notch looks pretty suspicious.
 That's closer, but not enough.
 The generator (6 topics)
 The information stud might distract her, but then she'll halt your efforts. Is
there anything else?
 The jig is up! There's no way you can sneak this past Cheryl.
 The next few hints tell you some things you don't need to worry about, so you
can narrow down the problem.
 The next hint will tell you exactly which thing.
 The power's on, now what?
 The probe's electromagnetic burst is bigger than the transmission's.
 The probe, of course.
 The question is how to get her on the other side.
 The time for subtlety is past.
 The transmission is emitted from within the slab.
 The transmit stud generates a pretty significant electromagnetic burst. It's
visible in both the hologram and the goggles.
 There doesn't seem to be a stud for opening it, so it must be something to do
with what's right there. What else might work on a panel like that?
 There must be something around she can look at.
 There should be a new stud to try out. Try it.
 There's a slot in the slab from when you brought the probe out.
 There's a stud that seems rather applicable...
 There's no way to prevent something showing up that she will see.
 This is a hint if you're having problems with Cheryl getting itchy for
information.
 This puzzle is pretty hard.
 Transmit (1 topic)
 Transmit go
 Transmit go, control rods, ignition.
 Try pushing the bottom button on the probe, then touch the transmit stud the
same turn the probe goes off.
 Unlike many of the studs, the ignition stud isn't a toggle.
 Wait until the status light starts flashing.

 Yi-Lono-Mordel
 You already have everything you need; it should all be mentioned in LOOK and
INV.
 You can answer Cheryl's questions or make snide remarks to statements by
typing 'TALK' just after she speaks.
 You can ask Cheryl to do things for you, but you can also just have
conversations.
 You can examine each stud to estimate its function.
 You can probe some things by putting the probe in them; others you should just
PROBE.
 You can put the probe back inside the slab.
 You can't get rid of Cheryl.
 You could pass the time chatting with Cheryl.
 You could try putting the probe on the slab first.
 You don't need to give Cheryl anything, ask her for anything, or give her any
commands.
 You don't want to do what Cheryl wants you to do.
 You must have something that can create emissions.
 You need to activate the probe and recalibrate at the same time.
 You need to look at the sequence information while Cheryl isn't looking at it.
 You need to wait a while for the installation to come fully online.
 You never need to TALK to win the game, nor will any use of it will ever lose
the game or make any puzzles harder.
 You probably should figure out what the bottom sensor does, while you're at
it.
 You really should be able to figure it out from the above hints. But ok...
 You want to activate Yi-Lono-Mordel.
 You weren't allowed to try one of them before...
 You won't be able to get any help from Cheryl.
 You'll need to push the sequence stud to find out what to do next.
 You've probed the bay and worked out what's wrong?
 You've successfully pushed the ignition stud?
