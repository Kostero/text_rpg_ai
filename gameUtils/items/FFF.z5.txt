 About the author
 Acknowledgments
 And you can only carry one of them at a time in the boat.
 Can you block the hole with something?
 Can't get any out that way.

 Comments and criticism (constructive or otherwise) are always welcome.
 CompassDirection
 Did you read the invoice?
 Do you have any way of bringing the duck with you, without holding it?
 Have you examined the sack closely?
 Have you tried opening the sack?
 Have you tried walking on water?
 Hint
 HintTopic
 How about the grain?
 How do I solve the puzzle?
 Is there somewhere you can put it to keep it from moving around?
 Likewise, you can't leave the duck and the grain alone together.
 Menu
 No, that didn't work.
 Not while holding the duck, though.
 Oar
 Once you've made a hole in the sack, you can't pick it up again.
 Option
 PUT FOX IN JUMPSUIT.
 PUT INVOICE IN HOLE.
 Perhaps you can close it off from the inside instead.
 Physical restraint won't do it.
 Room
 Special thanks to:
 Steve Kiefer, for beta testing
 SwitchOption
 TEAR SACK or MAKE HOLE IN SACK.
 TIE ROPE TO DUCK, then TIE ROPE TO ME.
 The boat is no longer an option.
 The correct order is:
 The duck
 The duck won't stay on the other shore without a good reason.
 The duck, again
 The fox
 The fox doesn't like the motion of the boat.
 The grain
 Then bring the pile of grain across along with the duck.
 There are certain rules you must follow.
 This is my first attempt at an IF game.
 This space intentionally left blank.
 Tie
 Try swimming.
 UNTIE ROPE FROM BOAT.
 Unless, that is, you find some way to seal the hole.
 What else would entice the duck to stay put?
 You can't hold it while you row.
 You can't leave the fox and the duck alone together.
 You can, however, walk *through* the water (in a sense).
 You didn't think it would be that easy, did you?
 You don't have any tape or glue.
 You need some way to keep it calm while you cross the river.
 You'll need to find some other way across.
 and SWIM.
 and my wife Chelsea, for putting up with my frequent babbling about my
progress on the game.
