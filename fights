(with the sword) The troll's weapon is knocked to the floor, leaving him unarmed. The troll, angered and humiliated, recovers his weapon. He appears to have an axe to grind with you. 
(with the sword) The fatal blow strikes the troll square in the heart: He dies. Almost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared. Your sword is no longer glowing.

. "Leave me alone" The sound of ten trillion tons of rock hitting the earth reaches your ears. It sounds like thunder, but much much louder. Windows smash, people scream. 
. "Leave me alone" A great wall of water suddenly roars out of the sea. 
. "Leave me alone" The wave breaks over the city. The houses disappear under the water. All up and down the coast the same thing is happening. The sky is now howling with wind. Red as fire, a hurricane has formed. Trees are being ripped up. 
 "Leave me alone" . At last the wall of water hits you. In slow motion you see the white massiveness come towards you, unbelievably fast. You turn away and crouch into a ball. You are spun round. You recognise that there is no escape. You had assumed that one way or another you would survive the asteroid, but now you realise that this is the end. You know what happens next. Your view fades and you feel yourself disappear. Your broken ribs, mangled leg and stunned mind all return to normal. Your clothes dry. You feel yourself floating, opening your eyes reveals that you are now in a space craft of some sort. This has been going on for as long as you can remember. You have become accustomed to the sudden jumping in space and time of your mind. In this case you welcome the change. The space craft feels positively welcoming after the previous scene. You are in a space craft of some description. White walls surround you, obscured by masses of wires, and other such junk. A hatch leads down. 
. The Mars 24 You are in a space ship, you would guess in the control capsule. It looks like a white cylinder, about 2 metres long and diameter 2 metres. Slight gravity. Wires are taped together and to the wall. A hatch leads down. A computer shows the status of various ship functions. All lights are green at the moment. . You can also see a window and a knife here.

(with the sword) The troll's weapon is knocked to the floor, leaving him unarmed. The troll, angered and humiliated, recovers his weapon. He appears to have an axe to grind with you. 
(with the sword) The troll is staggered, and drops to his knees. The troll slowly regains his feet. 
(with the sword) Your sword misses the troll by an inch. The troll's axe barely misses your ear. 
(with the sword) The troll takes a fatal blow and slumps to the floor dead. Almost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared. Your sword is no longer glowing.
