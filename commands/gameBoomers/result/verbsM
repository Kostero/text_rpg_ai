tired
go back to one too soon
was discussed in some of the posts
read the posts
have n't got him to leave the hut after that
am I
am totally ignoring the Myst hints and trying a new combo every time
again tonight and gave up after hours of
get the camoudile in the pit quite often
NOTHING ever happens
'm at my wits end
gotten the white mangree into the left most hutch the one with the berries
gotten him into the pit
give the code

have tried for hours
make them
crazy
were probably too late
tries
happen
were three important things about this puzzle
get to the proper screen

guide is only at ONE location at a time
do n't have an offering it will usually change locations
reach the well etc
may not be there
start
hope this will help someone
click the offering over the guide Did sparks swirl
feed all the spirits in Serenia or just the water spirit
go
may ca n't get the lousy snake lock
stop and release the mouse button
