doors that are outside in the main foyer area
inside you will see three portraits
shatter it
open

was a gray day
turned to look
was the postman on his bicycle
stopped to talk
pegged right off as the journalist
Valembois had told him of my letters
finished and rode on
up against the wind
had been researching an article on Amerzone
was in the mid thirties
came back
actually been there
flawed
was an Ostrich egg and an expensive one at that
destroyed
finally found employment as a natural history teacher
first hand information about Amerzone
had left was hanging out of the mail slot
in my pocket and pushed open the gate
went inside
was n't much on the bottom level
leaning against the wall near the bicycle
circular staircase twisted upwards
climbed it
probably from the thirties
was coming from an old record player
was no answer
were at the top of the stairs
was wearing a tattered old coat and strangely enough for being indoors an old fedora
felt inch brim with a velveteen band
was cold
was damp in that old pile of brick
as the source of the music
spread on the table weight on elbows
was slightly downcast
with the intention of introducing myself and giving him the letter
never got the chance
began his story
change both our lives
fell into a coughing fit
rest for awhile
did n't move for a few minutes
was gone
returned to Amerzone
felt as though I 'd gotten way too deep way
could have politely listened refused and left
were kind
was there
read the letter
fund another expedition to Amerzone
were still smarting from years ago
was on the letter
went to the phone on the wall under the staircase and dialed the museum 's number
could have a little more luck than the old man
hung up
dated
go for the native type with cheek tattoos
name was written in the corner
could n't decipher the handwriting
was a sideboard
open
could see documents inside
called Puebla
would
was not going adventuring
could find nothing else of value in the room
up to the next level
was a library of sorts
were taken in the jungle
was also a desk in the room
was a preservation of the biggest bug I 've ever seen
was in Amerzone
went through it
were becoming clear at least
was Yekoumani
did n't have Valembois '
was a ladder
climbed it to a small alcove above the library
wanted me to do
get to Amerzone
stairs up into the laboratory
was the metal door in the right hand wall
led outside to an iron catwalk that circled the building and a rope and pulley mechanism
was a ladder
be but found nothing
went
picked up
found a switch
illuminated
followed it to another circular stairway going down
was another tunnel
started to slope downwards
find the end of the tunnel
illuminated by a red light
open
made my way back to the room I 'd passed and went in
found a computer system that looked like an old Mac
throw knife switch
down and was rewarded by the hum of power
was to the right of the computer table
turned it on
was a beep
was on the lower right of the monitor case
on and the screen lit up
was the Hydraflot operating system
booted and asked me for a password
thought perhaps Valembois was as lazy as the rest of us
finished by selecting the star symbol
came up
saw a representation of the door at the end of the tunnel opening
enter the elevator something on the floor
was a key of some sort
up and entered the elevator
was another door that opened easily
was a huge room
could see a windowed office to the left
descended and made my way there
find the egg
get the elevator
returned to the elevator and went back to the top floor
was far down in the right hand corner almost level with the floor
had found earlier and pulled the control lever
was no door
patched
took out the sledge and hammered on the patched spot
collapsed
passed through the hole and walked down the catwalk
was a door
sitting on a small raised trolley
guessed showed the temperature of the egg and a single lever
roll out of sight down the rails
returned to the elevator and pulled the control lever
went back to the top floor
went down the stairs
was sitting on its trolley at the rear of the Hydraflot
turned right again
burning on the wall next to a ladder
found a lever
face the Hydraflot
was a walkway
down a tunnel with electrical cables and dim lights strung from the ceiling
soon arrived at a huge wall door
followed it to a small lift entered and went up
peered through the telescope
showed degrees
remembered that Valembois '
seemed almost too simple
returned to the Hydraflot
get
had the egg
had the Hydraflot
now was the time
found another computer
boot up
listing the six modes of operation of the Hydraflot
go by
asked for details
had seen through the telescope
saying Incoherent Data
was n't that simple
started going back through the journal for clues
was on page to the right of a sketch of the Hydraflot
was a representation of a flock of birds
was drawn through the center of the flock in their direction of travel
was a notation degrees
keyed in then the star symbol again
asked me to confirm the destination whatever
clicked on the confirm box
started down the rails toward the exit
followed the rails outside to a ramp
rotated to the proper heading
assisted take off bottle mounted above the cabin fired and flung us into the sky
was ejected into the sea
had n't made any provisions for Valembois ' remains
was
soon settled into the routine of the flight
was confident the Hydraflot
flew through the night into the next day
shattered
flashed accusingly from the panel
had his fatal collision
switch the operational mode to boat
go
was no gas
stopped
left that the machine
barely avoiding a collision
would be repeating Valembois '
submerged and entered a break in the atoll
had dislodged part of the wreck
fell into the opening blocking it
would n't be leaving that way
find gasoline
done
fishing from the pier
talk to the old goat
took the hint
got rid of the whale I 'd get no information from the old man
led off toward the mainland
followed it
propped up on the beach
had been turned into a bar and had what looked like a TV
diving helmet
was a potbellied stove
took the knife too
had its uses
never know when stuff can be handy
left the bar with my ill gotten gains
turned right and walked past a windmill
had seen on the other side of the lagoon
looked suspiciously like an aircraft hanger
could get some gas there
found a gas can
found a wrench on a workbench
returned to the Hydraflot
was to the left of the egg
dumped in the fuel
worked except grapnel
was also another question
gassed and changed course
was gon na need the old man after all
see about
did have the hardhat but no oxygen supply
back on the beach
went back there for a look around
was some sort of air pumping mechanism
could only get it
hand side of the foundation
led to other machinery in the front of the windmill on the sea side
shaped handle hanging down
jerked upwards
was wind power
walked around the left side of the foundation
sticking out of the top
across the foundation and down into the water
be a wheel
was
turned it
pulled the lever on top of the contraption
did things in that order
just seemed
picked up the hardhat
out into the lagoon
found some sort of projection coming up from the sea floor
was snagged on the projection
getting back to sea
were biting and the old goat was talkative
going again
finally left by ship
had a key to a chest
was
ignored
followed the beach past the windmill and the aircraft hanger
was the wreckage of a WW military plane
found a path through the cliffs
followed it to a dilapidated shack
found the chest
was a computer diskette
saw a faded photograph on the wall near the door
explorers standing with arms around each other
trudged back to the Hydraflot
boot
came up then helicopter mode
star and got the dreaded Incoherent Data message
was n't leaving just yet
seemed only one thing to do taek a look at Valembois ' sunken craft
was a clue there
went into the water
kept
got to the wreckage of a plane
saw it the submerged wreckage of the original Hydraflot
get inside
thought if Valembois had docked back
grapnel would be helpful
entered grapnel mode
plunked into the lagoon
was correct in my assumption
now lay next to the wreck
hooked it to the cabin door and went back to my Hydraflot
pulled the grapnel lever on the control panel
below ripped open
examined the computer
were the numbers
hoped was the last time
startup this time
push the lever next to the grapnel lever on the control panel
switched to plane mode
was proud of myself
step ahead of Valembois on the journey
was leaving in the Hydraflot
left on a Peruvian whaling ship
was however one small nagging concern
could go on a tank of gas
could be repeating my trip to the atoll
sputtered and died out of gas
did n't look friendly
stopped at a pier
was it
walkway leading to a gate set in a stone wall
went to it
locked
went back and followed it
led to a graveyard
was an ancient priest
looked at the headstone
was Yekoumani 's grave
had run out on her
introduced myself and told the Priest my story
you trust
was Father David Mackowski
had his letter to Valembois
was Puebla
was in the Amerzone
saw a building on the right with a flag
building perhaps
could help me
saw a man on the right side of it
woke up in a cell
was a cup on the bunk in the cell
could see a bottle of Tequila
drink
got out the cup
was just thinking of playing some spiteful juvenile trick on the guard
know the old bug in the booze trick
overflow the bottle
soon calmed down and the tequila appeared normal
was completely dissolved
reached down and lifted the bottle
heard drinking sounds then suddenly a body crashed to the ground in front of the hole
jerked back then reexamined the hole
set of keys just outside the hole
took them naturally
let myself out
saw a jeep
had a jerry can strapped to the back standard world wide jeep accoutrements
a rope that was in the back
know my theory on packratting
be a school
saw some grade school
inventor a missionary
was also a map of Amerzone showing
sat in the corner
had given the cockroach cocktail to
drinking
could handle him
went into a drunken ramble about shooting a priest somewhere
hoped not
go
quietly sneaked out
but still needed a diskette
my packrat theory should be useful somewhere
go down a well
guessing
climbed down
was right
merely turned left into the darkness
leaning against the doorway
pick it up
found a ladder
had come up inside the confessional
used
saw Father Mackowski
confirmed
had been shot
died
expedition were dead
had been witness to both their deaths
extend to the members of the present expedition
was a cupboard behind the altar
be a key somewhere
was a bible
opened it
be blank
unlocked the cupboard
debunk Valembois '
went back down the ladder in the confessional
use the sword
returned down the tunnel to the alcove of the saint
was a grating sound behind me
unblocked
grate went through
ended with a ladder
found myself in a small shed
discovered myself back in the graveyard outside the walls
emptied the jerry can into the filler pipe
inserted diskette into the computer clicked load then glider mode
began
stopped at a dilapidated pier
was n't out of gas so the reason for stopping was a mystery
climbed out to investigate
was a small hut on the pier
followed the trail into the jungle
soon came to another structure
be some sort of a map
found a can of gasoline
returned to the Hydraflot
emptied the gasoline can into the Hydraflot 's filler tube and activated the computer
went through the checklist
push the throttles to the right
came to a narrow passageway between two cliffs
was blocked by animals
were Porcopotamii
came across two tricorn buffalo standing in the river
as stupid but skittish
forward click on one of the buffaloes
one turned and charged the Hydraflot
rocked under the animal 's assault and actually moved backward in the water a short ways
damaged
get around the animals
thought of using the grapnel as a winch
forked
could see some rocks in the stream
shot the hooks forward toward the rocks click on rock through window
was pulled toward the rocks
twice more with success
ran out of rocks
fired the grapnel at it
shot out and passed over the animal 's head and tangled the line in it 's horns
produced by sheer terror the animal
passed around the end of the pier and charged up a shallow channel
caught on the edge of the pier
waded along the shoreline following the line in the water
seemed unhurt but thoroughly PO ed
get that grapnel back
walk up to that animal
was alive or conscious
started back towards the Hydraflot and came to a large tree
led off to the right
followed it into the jungle
used the old right hand rule
took the right
fetched up against a cliff face
blowpipe and a quiver of darts
were coated with some sort of tranquilizing goop
shot
turned left and approached the animal
at the animals chest and blew
snoring
back to the Hydraflot
go using this hook and drag method
but to find out
off to the right
did this twice more
consulted Valembois ' journal
were non dangerous
caught
could reel in one of the clever devils reached down with his proboscis
laugh
tried again
be some way to clear the buggers out
climbed out of the Hydraflot
heard intense buzzing
wall Giant wasp nests
use packrat sense kicking in again
a large one to the left
was also a pile of dead dried vegetation on the ground under the nests
returned to the Hydraflot before either the air force
continued my slow mode of progress
lost
held
passed across the face of a large waterfall
has identified in his journal
ran out of rocks and my final grapnel
stopped
climbed up on the pier
were to the right
left
stop now
walked off the pier
took the path into the village
was n't an abandoned village
enclosure stood a mechanism
bore the unmistakable marks of Valembois ' talent
be partitioned into cubicles or living areas
began on the immediate right and did my search counter clockwise
saw curious pieces of machinery
consisted
was some kind of grist mill
lined with dippers that reached down into a container
probably carried whatever was put into the container up into the machinery for some mysterious processing
was accessed through a doorway next to a skeleton on the ground
contained a raised platform with a second skeleton on top
finally found what was probably Valembois ' workshop
was overhung by an immense bird sculpture
activated device exactly like the one drawn in his journal
was also a drawer
was diskette
destroyed
was a back door in the workshop
went through it into the jungle
forked left and right around a huge tree
saw a blue black bug
captured it
rule here
saw up ahead what looked like a cave
ascended
saw a wooden walkway
came up through the center
start the machinery
turned right and explored the other fork
was at the end
was a small palm tree with one coconut on it
shook the tree
tingling
of inventory items that cried out for usage
had the raw ingredients
prepare
hoped I 'd find someone to help
returned to the village through the back door of Valembois '
disappointed
noticed two other things too
get
was on my own
be chopped open or hammered
was
was merrily banging away under its watermotive power
went to the rear of the machinery and dropped the coconut into the huge hopper
rolled out down a ramp
ran into a bowl under the pedestal
picked it up
was one other machine
located
was now also animated
disappeared up the conveyor
went to the opposite end
added it to my inventory
would
went to her
tell
handed her the egg
exclaimed
as the word for egg from the journal
handed her the bowl of green stuff
quickly followed with the coconut milk then the red bug
never got to the blue black bug
described in the journal
disappeared
was left alone with the egg and the blue black bug of course
be
returned to the Hydraflot
was tingling again
was the path right from the Hydraflot
had n't explored that
was impeded by a log gate in the water
headed toward the gate
wrapped around it
steeled myself and reached for the lever
heard flute music
was the Amerzone woman
pull
returned to the Hydraflot inserted diskette
turned right in the cockpit and noticed a lever
pulled it
was raised to the top of the platform then slid down a ramp into more water and stopped
used it
were heading into the swamp mentioned in Valembois ' journal
was getting settled for the ride disaster struck
coming but could do nothing
collapsed
braced myself and held on
was flung into the water
finished
lay partially submerged under the towing mechanism
find the egg
be a tree house built on an immense stump
still intact and apparently undamaged in its cradle
out and headed for the tree house
entered
found a small bag
else of value there
walked out on the porch of the hut
now saw that the towing structure was n't collapsed
ended here
wrecked
was never the intention
be done then
was n't attractive
coming up out of the water
have what looked like a loudspeaker
tingling
climbed down the ladder and waded to the pole
used the bag on the bottom one and a sound emerged from the speaker
lured out of the trees
quickly disappeared
found another pole
used the bag on the middle rung and saw off to the right the same or another animal
could n't go directly toward it
could turn in that direction
could double back
went by some
waded up
forged ahead for quite a ways turning only slightly right on occasion
were laying on platforms above the water
was also a pole with a loudspeaker there
used the bag on the lowest rung
footed giraffes came wading through the swamp toward me
was wearing a harness
forward
was short and ended next to a tree with with a ladder on it
goodbye and climbed the ladder
stretched into the fog
started across
ended at an immense cleft between two cliffs
sketched in Valembois ' journal
began the long climb upwards
entered
was holding a pistol
listened to his little speech on power
had come in his stead
was in pain or having trouble
have been very detrimental
would be no joy in Alvarezopolis tonight
be
were
took the medals from Alvarez 's uniform
was a wheel on the wall
was rewarded by the sound of stone grating on stone
climbed back down the steps of the pyramid
opened
scaffolding
down toward what looked like a crude forge
hanging over a very hot pit
threw Alvarez 's medals into the pan
lowered the container with the medals into the heat
ran from the bottom of the forge into a mold
formed a key
put it in my pocket
had a key
needed a keyhole
walked past the forge toward the far end of the chamber
was a lighted alcove
obelisk was standing there
be a keyhole
tried the key
fit
snapped back to it
heard wind and grating stone noises
returned to the top of the scaffold near the door and climbed the wooden steps to the top
sat a rather crude wooden glider
got in
was launched into space
it flew but not real well
found a cave
placed the egg on the throne
was some activity around the jewel
back and left the cave
turned left and went back toward the crash site
saw a dead bird near the edge of the lava pit
picked it up
formation sticking out into the pit like a pier
walked out on it
placed the egg and on top of the egg the dead bird
even claim that long after their death their lifeless bodies glide on tirelessly
say stories that feed the dreams of the children that live in the Amerzone
