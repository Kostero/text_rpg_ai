Xcom Hints and Tips Don't you just hate it when you are chasing down a UFO or sub and yourinterceptor runs out of fuel
Here's how to exploit a natural bug in thegame and let your interceptors stay airborne for several months at a time Make sure that it is completely repaired refuelled and rearmed then transferit to another base This requires a free hangar at that base
As soon as itarrives it should report quot ready quot to launch
Launch it to a waypoint of yourchoice and then check its fuel it should read
You can now stay in the airas long as you like because it has already passed the quot low fuel quot threshold To keep it quot magic quot like this simply remember to give it a quot patrol quot commandafter any interception
I usually don't do this much until I have sonicoccilators plasma cannons on the interceptor because those shot missiles goreally fast when you have unlimited quot hang time quot Tired of always knocking out those hard to kill mutons or lobstermen instead ofgetting the kill points for them
Afraid that Chryssalid Tentaculat is going towake up and turn your favorite squaddie into a zombie
Shoot the unconsciousgoon with explosive ammo or just toss a grenade its way
This is also a goodway to get new rookies their first quot kill quot points Xcom only Even though the manual says you can't acces the items amp equipmentscreen of mind controlled aliens there is a way around that
Go to one of yoursoldiers' equ
screen and click on the right left arrows until you get to thealien in question
Its picture should be a blonde male rookie with no armor andwith all of its grenades amp clips stuffed into its left leg pocket
Now you candisarm him completely grab a grenade arm it and drop it for Hari kiri or allkinds of other tricks
My favorite is having Cryssalids grab a med kit off thefloor and go around healing my soldiers Xcom only beware of entering a skyranger mission when you have a minimizedinterceptor window going
It has been known to crash the game after the missionends Xcom only Aliens on a floor just above you causing you trouble or blockingthe only elevator
fire a disruptor pulse launcher or a thermal shock launcherstraight up into the ceiling
The blast will hit only the floor above leavingyou unscathed Xcom only Here's an unconventional way to enter the larger subs if you haveMag
Ion armor look for overhanging corners that take up exactly half of themap square
Stand directly under one and go up
You will be partly in partlyout of the sub
From here you can walk right in through the wall but you can'tgo back so be careful
You can even go up multiple floors on ships like theDreadnought bypassing the winding passages and taking a shortcut to thecommand center if you like
This is especially useful for taking out a peskyalien commander who is hitting you with M C
control all the time
