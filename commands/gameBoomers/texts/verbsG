it's really easy to get killed if you wait too long here DON'T WAIT AROUND for the wolf or go and find it
despite what other players might say
There is a very quick and easy way to complete this section
Normally GK players would say use the talisman on the wolf to 'push' it backwards until you reach the raviene
DON'T BOTHER it's boring and labourious
Do it like this and tell all other GK players to do so if they want to speed along play You begin in a small wooded screen
Select your talisman from your inventory Click North then West then West then South then West NOW SAVE
WAITTTTTT
The wolf will come soon
It will appear at the bottom of the screen South Now use the talisman on it Quickly follow it if you wait then the wolf will have wandered off The wolf will jump you Von Glower shows up and throws you the gun
YOU CAN TRY AND SHOOT VON GLOWER IF YOU WANT NOTICE THAT'S WHAT VON ZELL IS TRYING TO TELL YOU
HE'S NODDING TOWARDS VON GLOWER
IF YOU SHOOT VON G THE WEREWOLF CURSE WILL BE BROKEN AND BOTH YOU AND VON ZELL WILL BE OK Not one GK player I've spoken to realises this But to avoid a very early conclusion to the game you have to click the gun on the wolf don't wait too long END OF CHAPTER In the end movie you notice a few things if you are sharp eyed Von Glower plugged his ears to block out the sound of Von Zell as a Wolf howling
the howling would cause Von Glower to turn into one Plus
Von Glower whispers The death of a werewolf cannot come from one of it's kind or something like that
That's why he could not shoot Von Zell Remember in the book it says any harm done to the Beta by the Alpha will also be inflicted on the Alpha If he shot Von Zell he would also die of a gun shot wound Plus when Gabe puked up he put his hand next to some BLACK HAIR on the rock Von Zell is blond haired and is not THE BLACK WOLF Plus as the Alpha Werewolf lives and you have been bitten you are becoming a WereWolf Plus you discover the secret places of hiding of the Lost Wager Opera Plus Grace has found you she THREATENED Huber's life ooooohhhhhh scary what with
Her notebook
Hah Plus RIGHT
THE FINALE And ooh yes you thought this would be the first game from Sierra where quick reflex pin point cursor reaction WOULD NOT come into play Hah

THE END GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
an adventurer rsquo s companion walkthrough by inferno It should be said here that this adventure is not your typical ldquo quest rdquo game
There are no ldquo timed sequences rdquo no mazes to get lost in
There are no ldquo slider rdquo puzzles with which to ponder nor are there ldquo word ciphers rdquo to rattle one rsquo s brain
No indeed this is not your average gaming fare
This ldquo game rdquo is really an ldquo edutainment rdquo piece a virtual and visual thesis if you will
It offers the gamer classic stories from the netherworld and ancient times long past
It presents experts and witnesses many of whom tell their odd tales of dread and thus make known their opinions of such things
Interestingly enough it begs the question ldquo Do you believe in Ghosts rdquo It also should be said that this adventure is completely nonlinear and there really is no right or wrong way to approach the game
The purpose of this walkthrough is to offer just one of the many ways one can proceed with the adventure and get the most out of it Think of it as a ldquo walking tour rdquo of Hobbs Manor and I will be your guide if you will allow Do you trust me
Mwuhahahaahaaa
Ahemmm hellip good then let us proceed After the opening credits are finished we find ourselves at the front door of Hobbs Manor
Now before we just go ahead and barge right into this stately home let us pause mdash Adventurers you know have long ago acquired the distasteful reputation for being infamously nosy thieves hellip opening every door we can
We are also famous for taking just about anything and everything that isn rsquo t nailed down and hiding these objects in our seemingly bottomless pockets
Just the other day I myself while cleaning out the front pockets of my cargo pants hellip something I always prefer to wear when playing any adventure mdash why
Simple hellip more pockets
Anyway wouldn rsquo t lsquo cha know
I found a six foot ladder in there hellip how it got there I rsquo ll never know hellip but I digress ldquo Sometimes fact is more frightening than fiction hellip rdquo Therefore let us take the time to be polite and knock
If you will kindly take out the magnifying glass that each one of you have been graciously been provided with by ldquo Media Design Interactive rdquo for use during this adventure and click on the knocker at the front door we can begin our tour ndash Excuse me What was that Yes hellip Yes I know that the magnifying glasses are quite old No we don rsquo t have any newer ones I rsquo m afraid If we could continue Thank you Now as I was saying hellip Let us position our magnifying glasses onto the knocker of the ancient oak door ndash ldquo Oops
Well he won rsquo t be winning any beauty pageants now will he
Better click outta rsquo here before he bites us
Let us turn the ringer in the center of the door and open it hellip As you read from the enclosed guide included with the game ndash Which undoubtedly you have all brought with you You all can see that Hobbs Manor located somewhere in the English countryside has stood since October
Ever since that fateful day of inhabitance its living members ndash owners children and servants alike have all at one time or another been witness to some very strange goings on
So strange in fact that throughout the Manor rsquo s history and legends very few people have been actually able to stay at Hobbs Manor for any considerable length of time
The man who greets us here one Dr Marcus Gramalkin ndash Who looks astoundingly like Dracu hellip uh hellip I mean rather Christopher Lee
tells us that he has made the study of ldquo the paranormal rdquo his life rsquo s work
It is here at Hobbs Manor that Dr Grimalkin advises us that he has gathered together all of the knowledge artifacts books papers photographs filled with eye witness testimony expert rsquo s videos and even a few ldquo professional rdquo ghost hunting gadgets for our perusal on this occasionally disturbing yet always compelling subject for the purpose of assembling evidence which he hopes will once and for all either prove or disprove the existence ofGHOSTS The good doctor has set forth a challenge for us to meet to discover the evidence awaiting us within the walls of this ancient Manor house and to decide for ourselves the answer to his question Do Ghosts really exist or are they only the things that go bump in the night
He invites us to search and look in every nook and cranny of his stately home for the proof we need Are we up for the task at hand my fellow adventurers
For those of you who may indeed be weak of heart and tender of stomach it is still not too late to leave by the front gate
The rest who are left will most definitely understand hellip Are they gone Good hellip I knew they rsquo d leave hellip tsk Probably FPS rsquo ers I rsquo m sure you all know the kind hellip They have the most dreadful habit of writing their names and their top scores on every program they play hellip Ahhhennmm If I may have everyone rsquo s attention
Yes thank you And now for the rest of you few intrepid explorers I give you You rsquo ll notice that as the learned Dr Grimalkin is speaking to us the Main Hall seems to contain a lot of interesting areas
Make note of them
There is a staircase to the left and a staircase to the right and upon each of these there are peculiar paintings which line the stairs
Straight in front of us we can see a Deep Sea Diving Helmet flanked by a closed door on either side of it
Under each side staircase which undoubtedly leads to the second floor we should take note that there is one hall table per side
On your left side the table seems to have a green manila file folder placed upon it
The right side table sports a few artifacts Hmmm where in our travels and other adventures have we seen these before
Better make note of these as well as we might need them later
As we back up from the hall table with the two ldquo totems rdquo on it in the upper right area we see a single doorway
Turn to the right again and we have a view of the Hall from where we entered
On the left there seems to be a Jacobean breakfront if we look closer we can see a perfectly ordinary photograph surrounded by a lovely wooden frame but don rsquo t click on the photo just yet
Notice as well the painting on the wall just to the right of the photograph
This is one of the many hauntingly beautiful pieces of artwork which Dr Grimalkin has painstakingly collected over the years
Each one we will soon discover has a story connected with it
Some like this one we will be able to study a little closer others we will be able to view but only from a distance yet the legends will still be there for us to uncover Now this particular painting is a beautiful rendition of an exterior doorway entrance encased in a lush overgrowth of ivy perhaps if we take a closer look hellip Oh
Oh dear hellip did you see that
The painting changed
And there rsquo s the good doctor again
What was it he said ldquo hellip Should you see a portrait fall from a wall look carefully at the subject of the painting
This unfortunate person may soon be dead hellip rdquo These are words of wisdom to be sure
We will find as we examine various items that Dr Grimalkin will pop in from time to time commenting on the items we are looking at by either explaining their purpose or sometimes offering ageless superstitions sage advice or ldquo folkloric rdquo wives rsquo tales as we make our way throughout the Manor Turn to the right again and we can see the other side of the Main Hall
There seems to be a set of closed double doors here and to the left of them what looks like a strange pink marble mask carefully positioned atop a brass stand which closely resembles an obscure double sundial a large hall mirror and some intricate vases
We should take note that they are here as well as two more paintings on the wall of the left staircase and will come back to them in good time but at the moment we cannot disregard the green manila folder on the table just under the stairs Let rsquo s do have a look shall we
Go ahead and open the manila folder I rsquo ll wait hellip hellip hellip What did you find
Yes excellent Such a savvy group There should be videotape and a photo file forFather John Nuttall Please don rsquo t say a word hellip we shouldn rsquo t poke fun at other people rsquo s last names
also there is a leaflet entitled ldquo Ghosts and Spirits in Religion rdquo Well what are you waiting for
This is what you rsquo ve searched all over Ebay for hellip to find this game hellip let rsquo s get started then we have much to do Let rsquo s take a closer look at Father Nutty hellip oops
I meant Father Nuttall rsquo s photo file
He looks like a nice enough man doesn rsquo t he
From the file it basically says that he is the parish ldquo Ghostbuster rdquo So remember hellip who ya gonna call
Father Nutt hellip uh sorry Then read the leaflet to learn about how some religions view the supernatural Interesting huh
I don rsquo t remember any of that from Sister Mary McCarthy and Catechism during my high school days at Sacred Heart Academy Next let rsquo s take a look at the videotape just click on the tape box and then when it opens up click on each question on the left to get a sense of how theCatholic Church views possession hauntings and exorcism
Well that was an eye opener Back out twice
Next turn right and have a closer look at thatDiving Helmet Good Evening Dr Grimalkin Gee whilickers
What an unnerving story hellip I wonder if he was talking about Leagues Under the Sea
Was there a Mr Montague in that story
Hmmm and I thought that it was just a legend You know many legends do have the basis in fact Back away from the Diving Helmet and turn either to the right or left and then turn once again so that you are facing the front door
Let rsquo s take a closer look at that photo on the Jacobean side board on the left
Click on the photograph and then click again and watch the portrait begin to glow with the greenish hue of ghostly ectoplasm as the first of many of the eyewitnesses recount theTale of the Forest and the Trumpeter Ooooooohhhhh Ahem hellip excuse me Ok now what do you make of that story
Haunted or was his playing just so horrendous that he frightened the poor little birdies out of the trees
Maybe it was the onset of a petite mal seizure hellip Epilepsy could strike us at any age you know And usually it strikes more men than women Just thought you would like to know However let us turn from this most unfortunate story no I really mean back away and turn left to the single closed door
Open the door and it looks like we have found Or the Living Room for us Yanks hellip
Let us go in and see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into
Turn to the right to view two more photographs
I bet they talk too
The trick here is that you have to click at least twice for each picture
Let rsquo s see
Go ahead hellip I lsquo ll wait ndash Back already So those are the stories of ldquo The Little Boy and the Shoppe rdquo and ldquo Septimus Severus and the Three Coins rdquo Do you have a Ghost Story hellip I do
hellip a number of them
Next let rsquo s examine the coffee table Interesting My grandmother had flocked wallpaper in her front vestibule that was very similar to the design we see here
When one would look at it as it was on the wall it appeared quite normal an ldquo allover rdquo fleur de lis pattern red on dark red
But when one would walk through the hallway and pass by the hall mirror out of the corner of one rsquo s eye one could distinctly see faces on the wall in the mirror rsquo s reflection
It was truly uncanny and something that my entire family experienced
An experience which we still speak of today when we all get together and reminisce It rsquo s time for ldquo Viewpoint rdquo on Telly
Go over to the Television set and click on it to turn it on
It rsquo s Viewpoint with your host ldquo Rhea Searcher rdquo No I rsquo mnotmaking this up hellip Listen to the story of ldquo The Nanny from Yorkshire rdquo Turn towards the fireplace and examine it thoroughly Oh
It rsquo s Dr Grimalkin again with yet another wives rsquo tale
You know my grandmother used to make us look for burnt cinders that were in the shape of coffins hellip
Personally I always thought it was to get us to clean up her hearth To get out of the ldquo fireplace loop rdquo click until you are centered you should be able to see part of the hearth and the mantle clock then pull the cursor to the left and click when you see the arrow change into the pointing hand
Follow it over to the desk Click on the closed desk
When the desk opens up we see a desk blotter with a number of things on it
Click on the center photo file ofDr

Next click on the photographs above the videotape box to learn aboutVickie TaylorandThe Case of the Sleeping Toilet Roll Now comes the videotape
Click to open and we find our third expertTony Cornellwho shares this interview tape with Dr Blackmore

Turn back to the left and go forward to the bookcase with the skull
It is here that theGHOST STORIESbegin
There are six of them hidden throughout the Manor each one of them beautifully told to us by Dr Grimalkin
The trick is to find them
Here in the Library we find the first one entitledBettiscombe Manor and The Screaming Skull Just click twice on the obvious sit back and listen to a tale of terror and dread When we are finished listening to the ghostly tale back out and visit the fireplace then turn right once again and continue lsquo round the room
See the turquoise Coat of Arms in the corner of the room
Make a note of it for we will leave it for now and come back to it later
Continue on across the Library room until you come to ldquo The Flying Book rdquo
Actually that really isn rsquo t the title of the book at all it rsquo s called ldquo The Book of Hauntings rdquo We may open the book now if you are in the mood for another ethereal tale from times gone by
But I suggest that you only read one or two more stories for now as we still have a lot to discover
There are over ghost stories and legends from all over the English countryside contained within the pages of this book and almost as many pictures but more on that later
For now we must pull ourselves away fromThe Book of Hauntings
Turn to the left and then straight on into another photograph and listen to an eyewitness recount a ghostly experience about anAbbey in Surreyand a group of hooded monks Once this is done we will leave The Library for the moment We now will exit out of the Library and enter into the Main Hall
Let rsquo s go forward twice into the Main Hall and then turn left we should be centered with the Diving Helmet
Continue on forward until we come to the door which is to the right of the Diving Helmet
Enter and go forward into mdash Click forward until you are inside the kitchen Hmmmm seems nice and clean

Let rsquo s try the overturned wine glass which is also on the table Oh
Hello there Dr Grimalkin
I was wondering were you had gotten your self to Let us turn from these two gory reminders of the macabre and make our way towards the back of the kitchen and the stove
Examine all the pots and pans hellip Just to see all of those useless hot spots
Okokokokok

These will allow you to scroll backwards and forwards as besuits your humor
The ldquo Continue rdquo button when clicked will allow for an unencumbered view of the postcard
Just click again anywhere within the postcard to bring back the ldquo remote rdquo and continue the slide show

Simply click on the ldquo Export rdquo button and a directory tree window will appear
In the upper left box type a title for the image you wish to export the images are exported as
BMP s or ldquo bitmap rdquo files Then click through the directory tree on the right side until you locate the folder that you wish to export the image to
I always use the folder ldquo GHOSTS rdquo This function will work only if you remember to include a ldquo rdquo symbol after the Title and before the BMP extension
If you forget it it will give you an error message saying that the file is invalid When you have completed the slideshow click on the ldquo Exit ldquo button to exit
Back away from these entrancing shadows and let us turn to the right

Shall we cross the room to the bureau
Let us first have a closer examination at the foot of the bed You never know what might be lurking under a Nanny's bed Geez Louise Very funny ok which one of you lost his head
Maybe we should just cross over to the bureau dresser and examine the jewelry box instead
At least that seems harmless enough Yikes
How rsquo d he do that
Must be ldquo mirrors rdquo or ldquo subterranean streams rdquo or something hellip Well there rsquo s another empty hearth hellip Has anyone seen any coffin shaped cinders yet
hellip Me neither We should back out of the fireplace turn right and carry on to the wardrobe You know the British are a sensible people hellip no closets

Perhaps he isn rsquo t speaking of the Holiday hellip Perhaps he means a different kind of Easter hellip as in Easter Island
Yes
That must be it
Now where did we see something from Easter Island
While we are thinking about it hellip we should turn to the right again and consult the two ldquo Expert Portraits rdquo in front of us of Dr Susan Blackmore and Tony Cornell
This time the question is ldquo Have Your Views of Ghosts amp Hauntings Changed Over the Years rdquo So tell me hellip which side are you leaning toward
Have you figured out about ldquo Easter rdquo

They will share a special relationship in the game in that they can talk to each other even when not near each other
And you will often need to show any objects you collect to one or both of the characters so they can help you and you do this through your inventory which has a section at the top with the two characters that you can click the objects on and therefore acts as a kind of telephone help service
The way the inventory works you do not actually pick up the objects just make a mental note they are there
It is not until you go to use them that you pick them up so when you read 'take' I mean try to take
You can choose whether to look talk or take by clicking and holding the left mouse button and allowing the arrow to fall on the correct symbol eye hand or mouth
This is not an exhaustive walkthrough only the main things you must do to get through it

DOUBLE WALKTHRU Graduated Hints Walkthru The steps of these graduated hints are incremental starting with general vague hints which may well be sufficient thro to complete spoilers for use if when needed Basic Walkthru If you re pressed for time or just haven t got the patience for the long winded Graduated Hints link through to the end and use the shorter and more straightforward Basic version

SOME GENERAL NOTES These hints describe how to perform ALL absolutely essential tasks throughout the game However they omit a lot of enjoyable secondary activities There are many variations which will not affect the final outcome In particular this format ignores many views and dialogs The latter are oftenextremelyhumorous and it s a pity to miss them
However some folk may find them lengthy amp or tedious They and all cut scenes can be skipped over by pressing Esc you can even keep your finger pressed on this key to skip large chunks of dialog BUT TAKE CARE you may fail to notice an important clue or dialog trigger The hints recommend you to deal with some specific character s amp or object s at each location However there are generally other characters and objects at almost every one of these locations which you can speak to or act upon In order to reduce complexity these have NOT been included below But you canalwaystry them out indeed in many cases you mayhave toreturn to them at some later stage in the game In such cases if you have already previously completed all the essential objectives you are not called upon to repeat any of them In general this is not a standard walkthru in that it is arranged by tasks and not efficiency In order to fulfill some task you may be told to go say to a certain location X in order to get object A At that location X you may possibly see objects B amp C but you are not told specifically to acquire them even though you COULD and probably WILL and no harm will come of this on the contrary it will shorten your subsequent gameplay somewhat Later on you may be told to return to the same location X and get object B and quite likely even later to go to X and get object C This is obviously not the shortest quickest or most efficient method However this type of longwinded description is hopefully the most logical and should minimize the number of downright spoilers You may possibly have some trouble if you do not follow theexactorder as described here amp or mix it with your own order Sometimes locations cannot be accessed or actions performed until some previous predetermined and sometimes obscure action or dialog has taken place If this is the case it isalwayspossible to find parallel situations which youcantackle until eventually your required path will be unblocked On the other hand it is quite likely that you may come across activities which are described but which you have already partially or fully completed As far as I know this should not affect your progress on the contrary it should save you some time Double clicking your left mouse button frequently speeds up movement particularly accessing locations on the map Items which appear in your inventoryfor the first timeare highlighted inred bold underlined italics whereas items used in or from your inventory later are highlighted inordinary bold red Although the vast majority of inventory items picked up are actually used and are essential to completing the game there are about a half dozen which take no part in the gameplay since they are never used at all As in most Quest Adventure computer games a few actions situations amp or objects may be redundant or even red herrings There is a raucous newspaper boy Olliver who you can consult whilst roaming Phungoria and surroundings He does not give you any actual hints as to what to do next or whatever but hedoesindirectly and humorously confirm in retrospect that you havecompletedcertain essential tasks satisfactorily Graduated Hints Walkthru A Getting to the City of Phungoria
How can Gilbert help his Grandfather Gilbert lives with his grandfather The adventure starts in his house But grandpa is in Phungoria where the mushroom is was He s invery serioustrouble So go to the City Look around open the door and exit Their home is high up on a small mountain The only way to get down to Phungoria City is by using the elevator The only problem is it doesn t work How do you get the elevator to work Since the elevator is down on the ground and since the machinery that normally brings the elevator up doesn t work when there s no wind Gilbert has to raise the elevator by hand Try turning machinery like that manually impossible You need something to operate the device What can you use
Look around the area There s an old washing machine located in the garden at the back of the house Grandpa s longunderwearis draped over it If you pick up the underwear something is revealed
What Pick up the washing machinecrank Use thecrankwith the crankcase to get the elevator up No good The crank breaks How do you fix the broken crank Any ideas what you might need to fix abroken crank Maybe some very strong glue But you haven t got any Then maybe you can manufacture some You ll need some substances Open the cupboard inside the house Look at the toiletries and pick up the travel case Examine the contents dental floss tooth brush andhair grease Walk outside behind the house and look at the window Did you examine the window carefully Pick up theresinlocated on the window frame Look at the tree opposite See anything apart from bees Pick up thetree sap which is on the tree Walk back inside and pick up thebiscuit ingredientsfrom the table Put the sticky substances into the mixer located on the table switch on and mix if when necessary You ll need four items altogether Use thehair grease resin tree sapandbiscuit ingredients the order is unimportant Eureka You just got yourself some super glue Use thebroken crankwith the super glue
Voila Look at the crank it s mended Gilbert can now use the repaired Super glued broken crankon the crankcase to raise the elevator up to house level Operate the elevator lever Going D O W N
Have a nice tttttrrrrriiiiippppp
Below the house itself There are various things here you can look at and do Whatever you do or don t do will not affect the outcome of the game So feel free here to investigate just as much or little as you wish Cross the bridge Gilbert hurries directly to the Phungoria townsquare N B In future crossing this bridge will not take you there but place you onto the map from which you can find your own way around
B Map of Phungoria amp surroundings
At your first opportunity take a look at the map of the village of Phungoria and its surroundings explore whatever you fancy both inside the City and outside There are around a dozen locations and even more people you can visit inside the City of Phungoria There are about a half dozen locations etc
outside the actual city Note the two different entrances to the City itself a horizontal pointing mushroom arrow and a diagonal pointing mushroom arrow Many locations can be visited immediately Some can only be accessed later in the game as a result of completing various specific tasks On the map itself you can only access the locations which are earmarked with pointing mushrooms Those designated by a white quadruple arrowhead are inaccessible at present but will become available later
C Postponing the execution
Phungoria Town Square When Gilbert arrives at the Town Square princess Michelle tells him that the Sheriff plans on having his grandfather executed in the evening She also tells Gilbert what he should do to help save his grandfather Gilbert has to masquerade as the King and as such later on that evening postpone the execution Continue talking to Michelle as long as necessary You can try flirting with her if you like How do you masquerade as the King Michelle told you that you need a bigger nose a robe or cloak a crown and something to make you look bigger If you forget later just get a reminder by looking at thecollector s card in your inventory Michelle handed it to you Bigger may mean gain some weight or maybe just get fatter
N B There is an apparent logic anomaly here Thecollector s cardshows the King as very bearded but Gilbert is and remains clean shaven
Where can you get a crown From the Town Square walk to the left and turn left a couple more times You ll get to the prison door wagon door stage etc You can talk to the Sheriff and to Gilbert s grandfather Abraham Goodmate It s doubtful that they will be of much help Look at Arver a hypochondriac
the man standing outside the prison feeding some birds with cornflakes Talk to him He will tell you at very great length all about his almost infinite number of ailments If you continue to talk to him sufficiently and then ask him he ll give you hisempty box of corn flakes But how do you actuallyacquirea crown Look at theempty box of corn flakesand you ll see a paper crown cut out on the back Perhaps Gilbert can use that crown Maybe cut it out from the box To do that you ll need something sharp Return to the Town Square and walk south to the docks There s an old fisherman there carving pipes with his pocketknife Talk with the old man and ask him to tell you a good fishing story Look at the shark s mouth and teeth hanging above him Apparently that wasn t a shark but a giant puffer fish Keep asking him to tell you a story particularly the one about Bearded Bart the Blasphemer and his pirate treasure Eventually the old man will fall asleep and the pocketknife will drop from his hand If it doesn t leave the scene and return immediately you ll probably find that he has dozed off in the meantime Pick up thepocketknife Use thepocketknifeon thebox of cornflakesto cut out thepaper crown Try to wear thepaper crown but it won t stay on What do you have to do with the crown You have to find some way to fix the paper crown so that it will stay on Gilbert s head Haven t seen any string around anywhere Gilbert needs something to tie the paper crown on with Maybe not string Maybe something else Where is there something alittlebit similar to string Near the City Gate find Sergio the phone operator Examine what he s doing and how Hey there s something near him Telephone cable That s similar to string Can t pick it up Gilbert can use thepocketknifeto cut off a piece of thetelephone cableand get it Use the telephonewireon thepaper crown Whoopee you now have apaper crown with wire it will stay on just fine Where can you find a false nose Walk to Tommy the sad boy standing next to the toy machine on the Town Square Talk as much as you can with him He tells Gilbert that his dad gave him some money to spend on the toy machine The boy says he hoped to get a super deluxe slingshot But instead he only won a big ugly rubber false nose If Gilbert can help the little boy get a super deluxe slingshot he will get the crummy fake nose Get the slingshot from the toy machine But how Perhaps Gilbert can break open the toy machine somehow With his bare hands
Maybe you can get help from ABOVE the toy machine Open the nearby door and go up to the tower Talk to Mad Pete Fedurski There s lots of VERY amusing things you can do there if you have the time interest and inclination Back and talk with Tommy Eventually he'll tell you how to trick Crazy Pete into firing his cannon Return to Pete Whenever you can inform him Look There s a Viking ship You may have to repeat this a few times With enough prompting he ll fire his cannon like mad and also drop his sword Pick up thesword Use theswordas a lever to push the loose stone over the edge This crushes the toy machine Go down and pick up the big rubber false nosethat Tommy left behind You ll also automatically get abottle of soapbubble liquid as a sort of consolation prize How do you get a robe Walk out of the City and onto the map then go to the farm Take the red cloak from the scarecrow out on the field Ha When Gilbert tries to pick up the cloak farmer Strawmusket tells him not to So how can you get the red robe How can you deal with the farmer Maybe you can find a way of getting rid of the farmer Gilford Strawmusket has an award winning pig on his farm To get rid of the farmer Gilbert has to find some method of chasing the pig away so that the farmer runs after it Return to the town and enter Elton s workshop To enter Elton s workshop for the first time only afterwards you simply knock and go in
you have to go through quite a ritual You have to answer sets of triple choice questions You willalwaysget the answers wrong but don t worry or try harder Then the th time you use the doorbell speakerphone intercom thing you ll just enter automatically Inside Elton s workshop Gilbert can pick up someblueprintslying next to the door Examine theblueprints Turn over the blueprints in inventory and you ll find a pig slaughter descriptionon the back Return to the farm and show theslaughter descriptionto the pig The pig will not look at it since it is very afraid of new people Keep talking to Strawmusket until the pig gets to know you Some time during this conversation whether you intend it or not you ll get a very largecorncob if Gilbert hasn t already taken it
Continue talking on and on to Strawmusket and showing theslaughter descriptionto the pig until it gets so terrified that it dashes away from the farm with the farmer in hot pursuit Now Gilbert can pick up the red cloak it s anunfinished King disguise How do you make Gilbert look bigger Go back into Grandpa s house Pick up thepillowfrom Gilbert s bed But that by itself is too thin to make him look like the King Go to the farm and look at the scarecrow It s made out of straw Pull out a bunch ofstraw Use thestrawto pad out thepillowand you get a wellstuffed pillow What do you have to do now to look like the King Gilbert now has all the items necessary to pass himself off as the King Simply add inventory objects to the red cloak unfinished King disguise You will need to attach in any order thepaper crown with wire thefake nose and thestuffed pillow You now possess yourfull King disguise and two fairly lengthy cut scenes will automatically start playing one after the other Interlude Two cut scenes In the evening Gilbert dresses up like the King confronts the Sheriff and orders the execution to be postponed for one week Later that evening you view a somewhat romantic scene between Gilbert and Michelle You learn that it was the Sheriff himself who stole the mushroom and that he smuggled it out to an island near the Phungorian coast In order to go after him you need a boat
D Hunting down the Sheriff
How do you find a boat Where is the most likely place you ll find a ship Go to the docks Enter the tavern Talk with Mr Harrison Davenport If you talk to him sufficiently he ll tell Gilbert that he wants a crystal ball and why He ll even loan Gilbert a boat in exchange for a crystal ball How do you get a crystal ball This is a very long drawn out process and will occupy almost the whole remainder of this long sectionD Gilbert talked to Davenport about someone who buys and uses crystal balls Walk to the fortuneteller Madame Zyz in the city Try to take her crystal ball She won t let you have it though Talk with Zyz and she will tell you about Larry s Caveshop
She always buys her crystal balls from his place Go to the map but you can t access Larry s Caveshop at present Apparently in order to get there Gilbert has to cross a bridge outside of town
The bridge is guarded now that the mushroom has been stolen so Gilbert has to deal with the bridge guard in order to get to Larry s Caveshop What can you do about the bridge guard Talk with the guard and after a while he will tell Gilbert how much he likes girls and in particular that he is interested in Sarah the waitress working in the tavern Go back to the tavern Pick up thenapkin with lipstick on it from the floor Sarah used this to blot her lips there is a conspicuous and alluring lipstick imprint of her lips on this napkin
Walk to the prison wagon stage Arver location and look around Pick up thebook of poemslying on the steps of Dr Fraud s wagon Perhaps you can write one of these mushy love poems onto the sexy napkin Go ahead write Have you got anything to write with Go to Elton s place knock on the door or use the doorbell speakerphone intercom thing and enter Pick up thefeather pen But the pen won t write It s empty Fill theempty feather penwith ink from the ink well You can also take theink well now or later you ll need it eventually Now Gilbert can use the inked feather penon thenapkin with lipstick on itand copy one of the love poems found in thebook of poems You have now manufactured a perfect bogus love letterfrom Sarah to give to the lonely bridge guard Give thelove letterto the bridge guard and he will very quickly abandon his post Larry s Caveshop Raise the barrier gate at the bridge you can now cross Go to Larry s Caveshop and have a good look around
N B If Larry s is still inaccessible it means that you haven t talked sufficiently to Madame Zyz or you haven t dealt with the bridge guard and raised the barrier
Talk at length to Larry Lachrymose You can try grabbing a crystal ball Larry s quite verbose and it may take some talking until you get him to quote you a price But you MUST continue the conversation until he does What
Ten thousand
Gilbert hasn t got that sort of cash How can Gilbert get one of Larry s exorbitant priced crystal balls Return to the tavern Talk with Snorri the lonely Viking sitting at the table He will tell you about the Vikings secret hideout in the woods where they have a treasure You need this treasure so that you can buy Larry s crystal ball Only after Snorri tells you about the treasure and you ve completed the dialog with Larry does the secret Viking hideout become accessible The secret Viking hideout in the woods Go to the map and walk to the secret Viking hideout Try opening the door to the Viking treasure chamber But Eric the Brave won t allow you to go anywhere near there Talk with Eric until he tells you that he needs a bungee cord How do you get a bungee cord Go and talk to Louise the lady on the balcony opposite Elton s workshop Look at the ladies underwear on the line Louise is the town gossip chat with her as much as you like Be sure to ask her about the bras on her washing line Keep on talking about the bras Eventually she will throw them down for Gilbert to deliver to a Mrs Mercer and daughters Watch Gilbert pick up thebrasand avoid embarrassment with princess Michelle Tie thebrastogether to form a primitivebungee cord Back to Eric the Brave Give thebungee cordto Eric the Brave and watch what happens Now open the door to the Viking treasure chamber Unfortunately the door is locked so you need the key Where can Gilbert find the key to the Viking treasure chamber Snorri the sad Viking said he had the key Go to the tavern again and try to get the key from him No dice The only thing Snorri seems interested in is hunting a fearsome beast Seen any ferocious beasts around not really But conversation with Snorri about fearsome beastsdidelicit some references to his feet boots an animal s hide etc Go to Saul the shoemaker at the townsquare There s a pair of fuzzy bunny slippers on his counter Wouldn t appear to be a ferocious beast but who knows Talk to Saul and talk and talk and talk Don t stop talking to him until he has introduced Sock and mentioned that he is sad for lack of a female companion Go back to Gilbert s home and into the back garden There s a lonely sock on the clothes line there Take thesock if you haven't already done so Return to Saul s As soon as you left him a free sample of shoe polish materialized on his counter Pick up theshoe polish In inventory combine theshoe polishwith the nice soft cottonsockand obtain asock puppet Give thesock puppet Sockette to Saul as a present for Sock In return Saul gives you a present of a pair offuzzy bunny slippers Return yet again to the tavern Give thefuzzy bunny slippersto Snorri You ll quite likely notice something new on his table which you can take now or leave until later Snorri moves to the bar now you can take his key to the secret Viking hideout You can t it s attached to his belt How can you obtain the key from Snorri Go to Elton s workshop Look at the mysterious invention with the hose Elton tells Gilbert it s avacuum cleaner so pick it up Go back again to Gilbert s home Walk into the back garden Try taking some bees wax amp or honey The bees won t let you get close enough Perhaps you can do something about those bees If you haven t already done so you can have a lot of fun looking and talking to the spelling bees Use thevacuum cleaneron the bees Gilbert stores his vacuum cleanerthere
The bees are trapped in the vacuum cleaner and Gilbert grabs a little malleablebees waxand Grade A goldenhoneyfrom the beehive Return to the tavern you ll first release the trapped bees
Use thebees waxwith Snorri s key
You have now made a perfectkey imprintin the bees wax How do you make an actual key Go to Vandersteen the blacksmith near the City Gate NOTE You may have previously performed all of the actions which cause Vandersteen to leave his smithy Do not panic there are two ways to continue A You can perform other actions andeventuallythe blacksmith will return B Return to the save before he leaves and postpone his departure till later
Talk to Vandersteen if you wish and give him thekey imprint Vandersteen tells Gilbert that he will make him a key but only if Gilbert can get him a dog Whilst you re there you can take Vandersteen s blacksmith sglove or else you can return for it later Go to Sam the blind man outside Elton s and talk to him Take his seeing eye dog Naturally Sam panics and you return his dog You ll have to fool poor Sam with a fake dog How can you make a fake dog Go to the farm Get thesack of wheat standing near to farmer Strawmusket s front door Investigate the sheep Any ideas Use crazy Pete sswordand shear the sheep and have a good laugh Pick up thewool If only you could stick the wool to something
If you haven t done so already go to Vandersteen s smithy and pick up his blacksmith sglove Go to the dock location Look around outside the tavern Perhaps you can use that barrel of tar Dip thegloveinto the tar you ll get atarred glove Transfer the tar from thetarred gloveto thesack of wheatand you get atarred sack of wheat Put thewoolon thetarred sack of wheatand you have afake dog You still haven t got Larry s crystal ball Take thefake dogto Sam Exchange it for the seeing eyedog Give thedogto the blacksmith and he will happily make akeyout of thekey imprint Go to the secret Viking hideout Use thekeyon the door Pick up the treasure a lot of gold You also find a strangeViking ticket to an annual slave market which you pick up You decide to leave behind some other interesting items Return to the Caveshop Givea lot of goldto Larry Unfortunately Larry cannot be stopped from smashing all of his precious crystal balls but he gives you acrowbarinstead You ll have to get your crystal ball somewhere else How can you get Madame Zyz s crystal ball Go to the fortuneteller s but when Gilbert arrives there Madame Zyz is out Grab her crystal ball from the table No way
the Genie will not allow you to take it Talk to the Genie Even though a lot of this dialog is not essential he is a most amusing character You can leave him and return whenever you like but you MUST persist until eventually he will promise to make something appear by magic He will give you aglow in the dark pal He will also give you a lot of vital info concerning how long the crystal ball lasts etc It begins to appear that Gilbert will have to travel into the future to that particular day when the crystal ball will stop working and Madame Zyz won t be able to see into the future How can Gilbert travel to the future Go and visit Elton the inventor You can examine his various mysterious inventions including his strange statue which turns out to be a robot Ask Elton if you can use his time machine He will refuse but if Gilbert nags him long enough and maybe pokes around his apparatus Elton will agree to demonstrate how the time machine works Since there are some heavy boxes in front of the control panel Elton commands his robot to lift move them out of the way But just as the robot starts to do this the drive belt on its back snaps To move those boxes and operate the control panel of the time machine you ll need a new drive belt for the robot How can you acquire a replacement drive belt for the robot Saul the shoemaker has a belt on his sewing machine But he won t let you take it You need to get Saul away from there Saul and crazy Pete are both members of the Phungorian Volunteer Army PVA who are sworn to keep the Vikings at bay Maybe you can get Pete to do something here Perhaps you can trick Pete into firing his cannon like crazy If Saul thinks the Vikings are invading maybe he ll join Pete in the battle But HOW can you trick Pete in this way Go to the tavern Look at the table where Snorri sat Pick up one of the tablenapkins
NOTE During the early parts of the game the napkin holder is empty You may have to perform other actions before it s full of napkins
Look at the napkin It has the tavern s ship logo on it and the logo looks just like a real Viking ship Go back to Pete s Slip thenapkinin front of his gun sight Gilbert will tell Pete that the Vikings are invading Pete goes berserk watch the fun Saul will leave his shop and join his fellow comrade in arms Now just go down and pick up that good strong sewing drive belt Get Elton to time travel Use the replacement belton the robot and it removes the heavy box Now Elton can demonstrate his time machine But it malfunctions and Elton never returns Also the time machine appears to have got damaged Gilbert notices a broken spring lying next to it Pick up thebroken spring
Gilbert won t be able to use the time machine until it s been repaired How do you fix the time machine s broken spring Gilbert needs an unbroken spring to fix the time machine Maybe the blacksmith can help
NOTE You may have previously performed all of the actions which cause Vandersteen to leave his smithy This is of no real importance In this case you obviously cannot discuss with him nor will you have to get him to leave since you ve already done so But otherwise you can continue without hindrance Incidentally eventually Vandersteen will return
Give Vandersteen thebroken spring He says that only a certified clockmaker can repair such a fine spring Unfortunately there aren t any in Phungoria However because Gilbert insists on the blacksmith trying to mend it he presumably smashes it since it vanishes from your inventory Gilbert couldreallyuse a certified clockmaker now How do you find a certified clockmaker You can t because there aren t any around But Vandersteen suggested that maybe an old clock spring might work Seen any old clocks around anywhere What about inside Gilbert s home How about the cuckoo clock next to his bed Go there and try it You can t do anything with the clock But when you look at it there s a hint that maybe you need a hammer to smash it open with The blacksmith has a big sledgehammer Try to get it from him But no matter how much you ask him he won t hand it over It looks as though you re going to have to get Vandersteen out of the way if indeed he s still there
How do you get rid of the blacksmith so that you can take his sledgehammer To do this you have to involve Lipton if you haven t already done this
On the map go to the bridge and click on the mushroom pointer just under it near the bottom left corner of your monitor screen Open the door and enter Lipton s house Look around and take the VIP card from the table But Lipton won t let you have it You can talk to Lipton for ages his only subject seems to be tea Sooner or later the topic of the VIP card will come up Apparently it enables Lipton to phone Vandersteen and call him over to perform almost daily repairs on the ancient bridge If you can somehow get that VIP card maybe the blacksmith will leave his smithy How do you get the VIP card from Lipton Lipton talks and talks and talks Maybe you can distract him somehow Get him to describe his great battles Make sure he mentions his wonderful unnamed tea and ask him if he s tasted it Maybe you can drug him with that For this you are going to need items A special filter for drinking that unnamed tea some sweetener and some sleeping powder How do you get a very fine tea filter Arver the hypochondriac is wearing a mask to filter all germs from the air he breathes Get his mask filter But Arver will only let you have it if you give him a bottle of Dr Fraud s miracle medicine How do you get Dr Fraud s miracle medicine Get Gilbert to talk to Dr Fraud through his wagon door He tells Gilbert that he needs help to start his next show If Gilbert helps Dr Fraud maybe he ll get a free bottle of his miracle medicine Gilbert s got to show the audience that you get really strong after drinking the medicine He s going to have to cheat here he s going to have to make a fake weight bar How do you build a weight bar Return to Lipton s There s a river outside his house Floating in this river are two cannonballs they float since Pete s cannonballs are notrealones but made of balsa wood Maybe you ve taken them already If not pick up the twocannonballs Go to the junk pile outside Elton s workshop Pick up the light aluminum metal barstanding there In your inventory combine thecannonballsand thealuminum barto create afake weight bar Dr
Fraud s demonstration and Arver s exchange Go back to Dr Fraud s wagon Talk to him again and now that you have the fake weight bar he will begin his show Watch the fairly long cut scene of Dr Fraud defrauding After the show Dr Fraud will present Gilbert with a bottle of themiracle medicine He also gives Gilbert two bonus gifts a bottle ofstarchand theworld s smallest juice press Look at the starch You can examine thejuice pressbutdon t get AT ALL upset if anything weird happens to it Turn to Arver Exchange themiracle medicinefor his ultra fine filter What can Lipton do with the filter Give the filter to Lipton and see what happens He ll give Gilbert the key to the tea cabinet and the unnamed tea is ready for drinking But Lipton will only drink the bitter tea it if it s sweetened to make it palatable You ve probably got some sweetener by now in your inventory You need some honey If by any chance you haven t got any look back at section D How can you obtain the key from Snorri and get what you need from the beehive But the tea is still too bitter and Lipton spits it out Seems you re going to have toreallytranquilize the old geezer Looks like you re going to need something to put Lipton to sleep How can you get some sleeping powder Go to the docks Talk to Armand Hammer He says he s an undercover agent for the PBI Phungorian Bureau of Investigation impersonating a drug pusher
Talk to Hammer for a while He will persuade Gilbert to reluctantly accept some drugs but it s only somesleeping powder How can you get Lipton to actually drink his unnamed tea In inventory mix thesleeping powderwith thehoney You ve now got somedrugged honey Give thedrugged honeyto Lipton That knocks him out
NOTE It s preferable not to perform the following steps earlier than necessary Although this is not absolutely essential it may save you unnecessary hassle later on There are additional notes on this in the appropriate places Take the VIP card and phone Vandersteen
N B Notice that by now the vandalized telephone cable has been repaired
Leave Lipton s before Vandersteen gets there What can you do with Vandersteen s hammer Go to the blacksmith s now that he s no longer there Borrow his hammer and promise to return it later Return to Gilbert s house Smash the cuckoo clock Gilbert s wanted to do that for ages
Pick up the perfectly good spring Time travel Go to Elton s Put thespringinto the time machine Use the control panel You re now at Madame Zyz s but years into the future You can always return to the present via the time portal near the right edge of the screen If you try to enter her front door it will be locked she s closed at present But you can use the time machine as often as you like and you will get to her in the future Talk to her Try taking her broken crystal ball Nothing you attempt will induce her to give it to you Suppose you could make her more generous
But for that you re going to need some generosity potion Where can you find some generosity potion Go to Barry who has a stall at the Town Square Talk to him and try to persuade him to demonstrate just how good his generosity potion is He s frightened to do this in case he becomes so generous that he might make you a present of his last bottle But he ll agree if you are prepared to sign a contract with him You almost certainly got a full i e
inked pen from Elton s workshop If you didn t pick it up earlier take theink well also You may not yet have acquired suitable paper on which to sign the contract Enter the Sheriff s house alongside Madame Zyz s originally his door was locked
Look at the chest there Open it But it s locked Use yourcrowbaron it Look inside the chest Read thebook and a paper flutters to the floor Pick up thepaper Check that you have a full pen ink and paper in your inventory Return to Barry Now he will sign the contract However after drinking a little potion he gets so generous that he tears up the contract and gives you a free sample thegenerosity potion To Madame Zyz again and beyond Use the time machine again and go to Madame Zyz in the future Pour thegenerosity potioninto her perfume bottle and she ll give you hercrystal balland also afeather duster Walk out through the time portal Go to the tavern Give thecrystal ballto Mr Davenport Cut scene Davenport will reluctantly allow Gilbert to borrow one of his boats albeit a small rowboat at the docks but sufficient for him to finally get away from Phungoria and follow the Sheriff to the island
E Getting the mushroom
How do you get inside the caves Before you do anything else it s worth while talking to Elton until you find out what items you need to complete his raft
This may seem premature since you are nowhere near ready to leave the island yet nor can you But you may not get an opportunity to do this later
Explore the small island There are thick iron bars blocking the entrance to a cave You ll have to get past those iron bars They re too strong to bend Have you tried using inventory tools Nothing seems to work What s in front of the bars Sand Maybe you can do something with that sand How about digging a tunnel through the sand and under the iron bars You ll have to find something suitable with which to dig There s a shovel nearby But the pirates won t let you touch it How can you get hold of the shovel Talk to the pirates Particularly the pirate captain Carry on talking to him Eventually Gilbert will rile him with You guys aren t really pirates at all are you He taunts them as looking like geeks with glasses specs until eventually they throw their spectacles onto the ground Now they can hardly seeanything Pick up theshovel without the pirates knowing
Use theshovelon the sand to dig a hole under the bars You find atreasure chestburied in the sand which you pick up automatically But when you get inside the cave it s dark and you can t do a thing How do you light up the cave Have you got a flashlight or whatever No But you have got a glow in the dark pal Doesn t seem to work Maybe it needs recharging Something hot may do the trick Exit the cave via the hole you just dug Go back to the beach and look at the white rock Now THAT s hot from the sun Place theglow in the dark palon the white rock and it will fully charge You ve now got afully charged glow in the dark palwhich isreallyglowing But it will only stay charged for minutes REAL time After that you ll have to keep on returning and charging it Return to the cave as quickly as possible How do you get into the second cave Use thefully charged glow in the dark palto light up the cave There is a wall at the far right end of the cave with a slider puzzle Solve the slider puzzle When you complete the slider puzzle the wall will rumble and open How do you solve the slider puzzle Some players do not like slider puzzles and especially timed ones But this is a particularly easy x slider The light from the fully charged glow in the dark pal gets weaker and goes out after seconds so you have to recharge it as mentioned above However the puzzle does not rearrange itself each time you can continue from where you left off You can even save any configuration in the middle and load it back again as was The final picture is simply a full screen upright mushroom Most folk should be able to solve this puzzle if not the very first time then after no more than a few attempts However for any who are completely baffled one optimum solution is given below there are quite probably better solutions with maybe considerably less moves than the outlined below
Labeling the rows from top to bottom A B amp C and the columns from left to right amp Click on the following TILES in this particular order C C B A A B B A A B C C B B C C B A A B C C B B C C B B C C B B B C What do you do in the second cave room Enter the second middle cave room Pick up thebamboo pole Pick up the liter bucketstanding there Pick up thebroken liter bucket Now you re there you ll want to get on and into the third innermost cave In order to reach the inner cave you have to lower a bridge to cross an underground river To do this you have to place a bucket containing liters of water onto the scale Unfortunately there s a hole in the broken liter bucket How do you fix the hole in the broken bucket Return to the pirate chef Get him to make you a big glob of lime greenjelly Maybe that will patch up the hole in the broken liter bucket Possibly
you can see if it will hold water If not you ll have to manufacture a stronger patch Put thestarchon the shelf with the ingredients in exchange for the sugar remember the chef can t see anything
Ask the chef to make you some more jelly This time you ll get a big glob ofincredibly firm jelly Apply theincredibly firm jellyto the hole in thebroken liter bucket Gilbert Goodmate s shameless plug You ve now got a repaired liter bucket with a firm jelly patch How do you solve the water buckets puzzle With your serviceable buckets you have to put liters of water onto the scale This is an easy puzzle which can be solved in several ways If you arereallystuck probably the quickest solution is as follows Fill the liter bucket from the pump Pour the liter bucket into the liter bucket Empty the liter bucket Pour the liter bucket now containing only liters of water into the liter bucket
Fill the liter bucket Pour the liter bucket into the liter bucket which already holds liters of water Finally place the liter bucket holding liters of wateronto the scale The bridge descends and Gilbert can cross the river and into the third cave How do you stop the Sheriff As Gilbert enters the inner cave room the Sheriff is making a magic brew to wake up the Not quite dead enough evil wizard Karn The Sheriff notices Gilbert and throws the mushroom the final ingredient into the boiling cauldron You have to stop the Sheriff s chanting or the wizard will come to life again and you won t get the mushroom Grab the Sheriff s magic book But the Sheriff won t give it up How can you get it You ll probably have to find some way of stopping the struggle How can you make the Sheriff loosen his hold on the spell book Try tickling him with yourfeather pen The Sheriff runs away through the left hand exit but blows it up and seals it after his retreat He leaves behind hisbook of magic you can read it once if you wish Gilbert must pick up the mushroom before it turns to stew You won t be able to get out of there till you do But the cauldron and its contents are very hot Use theglovewith the mushroom and you can pick it up Wow You ve just rescued the Mushroomof Phungoria OK you ve grabbed the sacred mushroom what now Better get off that island and back to Phungoria How do you get away from the island Go to the beach and use your rowboat You can t the Sheriff s explosion has smashed it You ll probably have to use the raft But it s not ready yet Did you talk to Elton and find out what additional parts he needs to finish the raft You were recommended to do this as your first action on reaching the island
In case you didn t get the information from Elton earlier He needs some pedals a rudder and some rope Walk back to the pirates Take thepedalsfrom the bike on the pile of sand Pick up the flotation device floating in the water near to the rowboat It s too far away
I can t reach it Use thebamboo poleto fish it out You will get aflotation device with ropeand abroken rudder Untie theflotation device with ropeto obtain therope Gilbert will have to repair that rudder Tried items in your inventory Nothing works Return to the chef s kitchen Pick up theapronnear to the chef If Gilbert looks in the pockets of theapron he will find ahammer and nails Use thehammer and nailson thebroken rudderto repair it you ve now got a usablerudder Now use thepedals the repairedrudderand theropeon the raft in any order Use the finished raft Cut scene Gilbert and Elton can now head back to Phungoria Unfortunately the raft springs a leak and sinks They both have to swim for it Gilbert is spotted by a Viking ship he s kidnapped and transported to the Viking village up in the North
F Escape from the Vikings
What can you do in the Viking village Look around the Viking slave pit Talk to Arver Gilbert automatically gets aslave guideleaflet Talk to the Indian chief Apparently you are not confined to the slave pit Climb the ladder and go out Look around the Viking village How can you make the slave market begin Walk to the tourist information Pick up the plastic Viking helmet One of its horns will drop off Get the hollow plastichorn Go to the seashore and watch the guy painting the ship red It s a good idea to talk to him as well Dip thehorninto the red paint An orchestral horn sounds Gilbert is transported to a room with Arver and chief Stepping On Toes What happens at this slave market You re in a dressing room to prepare for the slave auction The buyers want healthy slaves with good teeth and straight postures Gilbert doesn t want to be sold as a slave so he d better sabotage these attributes In the first part of the auction the slaves will be wearing swimming trunks and in the second part they ll be wearing evening gowns Gilbert will have to deal with both these performances How can Gilbert look bad in swimming trunks You need to give Gilbert some dental treatment How can you make his teeth look rotten Try using the ink You need to apply it with something Use thetoothbrushwith theink That does the job But you ve also got to get his body looking generally unhealthy Pick up the small handmirrorlying on the wooden counter Smash the mirror against the counter and you ll have abroken mirror Look on the floor There s a piece of very sharp glass there Pick up the shard ofbroken glass Use thecrowbaron thetreasure chest which you got previously on the island if you haven t already done this
Continue using the crowbar on the inner chest and the next one The crowbar broke and you are left with aninsignificant chest Open theinsignificant chestby hand You will find a surprisingly well preservedpotatoand an ancient descriptive note Use thebroken glasson thepotato You get apotato stamp Dip thepotato stampinto the plastichorn full of paint and Gilbert will cover himself with red blotches which look like some hideous rash Cut scene The buyers will reject Gilbert and also Arver and the Indian chief How can Gilbert avoid looking good in an evening gown Gilbert needs to change his carriage somehow so that he looks terrible in an evening gown Use thepillowwith theapron This makes an excellent hunchback Cut scene The buyers don t want any of them That s the good news But instead all three are going to be sacrificed to the Vikings ancient gods by being thrown over the cliff of death Gilbert is given aslave market certificate of participation When Gilbert talked to the Viking ship painter he laughed and told him that the only way for a slave to escape from the village would be for him to fly over the mountains like a bird
Gilbert really takes this seriously though Perhaps

Gilbert needs to escape from the village but how Well if he wants to fly maybe he can make some wings For wings Gilbert may need feathers Go back to the Viking slave pit Talk to the Indian chief He is out of tobacco Maybe you can find him something else to put in his empty pipe How about blowing bubbles instead of smoke magic bubbles Give him yourbottle of soapand he ll give you his feather headdressand a now superfluous box of waterproofmatches Go to the boxing ring Try to take the feathers on the floor there The two demonstrating roosters won t let you take them Go to the tourist information and pick up thefirecrackersthere You need to have in your inventory both the firecrackers and the matches When you ve got themboth go to the roosters and use thefirecrackerson either one of them BOOM
Pick up the roosterfeathers You will need more feathers in order to fly Walk to the stage Talk to the big Viking executioner The executioner will tell Gilbert about his giant torture feather Ask him to let you have it Only if Gilbert can endure the terrible feather torture Try it Ha ha ha No one can endure the feather torture Gilbert will have to find something to protect the soles of his feet from the tickling How do you endure the feather torture without laughing Go to the tourist information and to Helga the masculine feminine Viking Talk to him her Helga has some face cream Maybe that will help But he won t part with it Helga will talk about how hairy his legs are and how he d like them to be smooth Perhaps there s some way to help him with that How can you help Helga Go to the seashore Pick up thesticky advertisementon the bulletin board The back of the advertisement isverysticky Use thesticky advertisementon Helga If you talk too much the glue on the back dries out and you ll have to get another sticky backed advertisement
OK One leg s smooth what about the other leg But you need more paper this one is covered in hair So get another sticky advertisement Sorry no more available You ll have to figure some different hair removal system for Helga s remaining hairy leg What about Helga s other leg You ll have to get inside the Viking banquet hall for that Right Enter But first you have to present a ticket to the Viking ticket collector So give him your ticket for the th Annual Viking Slave Market But this is invalid it s out of date Gilbert has just participated in the thAnnual Viking Slave Market He won t accept that ticket So look at your slave market certificate See anythinginteresting Use yourbroken glasson Gilbert sslave market certificateto cut out thecertificate clipping

and give you WINGS Cut scenes The following morning Gilbert and the other two slaves are brought up to the highest mountain to face their destiny Somehow it doesn t appear too fatal for any of them However before he gets pushed over the edge Gilbert uses his wings to fly away towards the city of Phungoria Well almost anyway His wings fall to pieces as he cruises past the tall mountains and he crash lands right outside the Sheriff s cabin The Sheriff has kidnapped the princess and locked her up in the cabin Gilbert overhears all his nefarious plans
G Rescuing the Princess and saving the world
Try to get into the Sheriff s cabin How can Gilbert enter the cabin He can t What CAN he do then If Mohammed can t go to the mountain The only way to capture the Sheriff is to scare him out of the cabin What have you got that might do the trick Where should you use whatever device you wish to try Throw the bigcorncobdown the chimney When the corncob hits the fireplace inside the house it will start to pop just like popcorn The Sheriff panics thinking he s being shot at and runs out of the house Cut scenes You have now completed the game at least the interactive part of it Sit back and watch the confrontation between Gilbert and the Sheriff and the conclusion of the story with its hint of a possible sequel It s worth while watching the credits walkthru author s name included since the short video film clips blurbs etc are original and highly amusing

Cross the bridge Gilbert hurries directly to the Phungoria townsquare N B In future crossing this bridge will not take you there but place you onto the map from which you can find your own way around
B Map of Phungoria amp surroundings
Take a look at the map of the village of Phungoria and its surroundings There are around a dozen locations and even more people you can visit inside the City of Phungoria and about a half dozen locations etc
outside the actual city Note the two different entrances to the City itself a horizontal pointing mushroom arrow and a diagonal pointing mushroom arrow Many locations can be visited immediately Some can only be accessed later in the game as a result of completing various specific tasks On the map itself you can only access the locations which are earmarked with pointing mushrooms Those designated by a white quadruple arrowhead are inaccessible at present but will become available later
C Postponing the execution
When Gilbert arrives at the Town Square princess Michelle tells him that the Sheriff plans on having his grandfather executed in the evening She also tells Gilbert what he should do to help save his grandfather Gilbert has to masquerade as the King and as such later on that evening postpone the execution Michelle told you that to masquerade as the King you need a bigger nose a robe or cloak a crown and something to make you look bigger If you forget later just get a reminder by looking at thecollector s card in your inventory Michelle handed it to you Continue talking to Michelle as long as necessary You can try flirting with her if you like From the Town Square walk to the left and turn left a couple more times You ll get to Arver a hypochondriac
the man standing outside the prison feeding some birds with cornflakes Talk to Arver He will tell you at very great length all about his almost infinite number of ailments If you continue to talk to him sufficiently and then ask him he ll give you hisempty box of corn flakes Look at theempty box of corn flakesand you ll see a paper crown cut out on the back Return to the Town Square and walk south to the docks There s an old fisherman there carving pipes with his pocketknife Talk with the old man and ask him to tell you a good fishing story Look at the shark s mouth and teeth hanging above him Apparently that wasn t a shark but a giant puffer fish Keep asking him to tell you a story particularly the one about Bearded Bart the Blasphemer and his pirate treasure Eventually the old man will fall asleep and the pocketknife will drop from his hand If it doesn t leave the scene and return immediately you ll probably find that he has dozed off in the meantime Pick up thepocketknife Use thepocketknifeon thebox of cornflakesto cut out thepaper crown Try to wear thepaper crown but it won t stay on Go to Sergio the phone operator near the City Gate Use thepocketknifeto cut off a piece of histelephone cable Use thetelephone wireon thepaper crown Whoopee you now have apaper crown with wire it will stay on just fine Talk as much as you can with Tommy the sad boy standing next to the toy machine on the Town Square He won a big ugly fake nose from the toy machine but he wants a super deluxe slingshot Open the nearby door and go up to the tower Conduct a very amusing dialog with Mad Pete Fedurski Go down and talk to Tommy until he tells you how to trick Crazy Pete into firing his cannon Return to Pete and whenever you can inform him Look There s a Viking ship You may have to repeat this a few times With enough prompting he ll fire his cannon like mad and also drop his sword Pick up thesword Use theswordas a lever to push the loose stone over the edge This crushes the toy machine Go down and pick up the crummy rubber false nosethat Tommy left behind You ll also automatically get abottle of soapbubble liquid Walk out of the City and onto the map then go to the farm Take the scarecrow s red cloak But farmer Strawmusket won t let Gilbert touch it so you ll have to get him out of the way Return to the town and enter Elton s workshop Note To enter Elton s workshop for the first time only afterwards you simply knock and go in
you have to go through quite a ritual You have to answer sets of triple choice questions You willalwaysget the answers wrong but don t worry or try harder Then the th time you use the doorbell speakerphone intercom thing you ll just enter automatically Pick up someblueprintslying next to the door Examine theblueprints Turn over the blueprints in inventory and you ll find a pig slaughter descriptionon the back Return to the farm and show theslaughter descriptionto the pig The pig will not look at it since it is very afraid of new people Keep talking to Strawmusket until the pig gets to know you Some time during this conversation whether you intend it or not you ll automatically get a very largecorncob if Gilbert hasn t already taken it
Continue talking on and on to Strawmusket and showing theslaughter descriptionto the pig until it gets so terrified that it dashes away from the farm with the farmer in hot pursuit Pick up the red cloak it s anunfinished King disguise Take a bunch of the scarecrow sstraw Return to the house and take thepillowfrom the bed In inventory use yourstrawto pad out thepillowand you get a wellstuffed pillow Attach in any order to the red cloak unfinished King disguisethe inventory objects paper crown with wire thefake nose and thestuffed pillow You now possess yourfull King disguise and two fairly lengthy cut scenes will automatically start playing In the evening Gilbert dresses up like the King confronts the Sheriff and orders the execution to be postponed for one week Later that evening you view a somewhat romantic scene between Gilbert and Michelle You learn that it was the Sheriff himself who stole the mushroom and that he smuggled it out to an island near the Phungorian coast In order to go after him you need a boat
D Hunting down the Sheriff
Go to the docks Enter the tavern Talk with Mr Harrison Davenport until he tells Gilbert why he wants a crystal ball and that he ll loan Gilbert a boat in exchange for one Almost the whole remainder of this long sectionDinvolves acquiring a crystal ball Walk to the fortuneteller Madame Zyz in the city and try to take her crystal ball No go Talk with Zyz and she ll tell you about Larry s Caveshop To access Larry s Caveshop Gilbert has to cross a bridge outside of town Ever since the mushroom has been stolen the bridge is guarded so you ll have to deal with the bridge guard Talk with the guard He ll eventually tell Gilbert that he likes Sarah the waitress working in the tavern Go back to the tavern and pick up thenapkin with lipstick on it from the floor Walk to the prison wagon stage Arver location and pick up thebook of poemslying on the steps of Dr Fraud s wagon Go to Elton s place knock on the door or use the doorbell speakerphone intercom thing and enter Pick up thefeather pen Fill theempty feather penwith ink from the ink well and take theink well now or later Use the inked feather penon thenapkin with lipstick on itand copy one of the love poems found in thebook of poems making a bogus love letterfrom Sarah Give thelove letterto the bridge guard and he will very quickly abandon his post Raise the barrier gate at the bridge and cross Go to Larry s Caveshop N B If Larry s is still inaccessible it means that you haven t talked sufficiently to Madame Zyz or you haven t dealt with the bridge guard and raised the barrier
Talk at length to Larry Lachrymose You can try grabbing a crystal ball Larry s quite verbose and it may take some talking until you get him to quote you a price But you MUST continue the conversation until he does What
Ten thousand
Gilbert hasn t got that sort of cash Return to the tavern and talk with Snorri the lonely Viking sitting at the table
He will tell you about the Vikings secret hideout in the woods where they have a treasure You need this treasure so that you can buy Larry s crystal ball Only after Snorri tells you about the treasure and you ve completed the dialog with Larry does the secret Viking hideout become accessible Go to the map and walk to the secret Viking hideout Try opening the door to the Viking treasure chamber But Eric the Brave won t allow you to go anywhere near there Talk with Eric until he tells you that he needs a bungee cord Go and talk to Louise the lady on the balcony opposite Elton s workshop Look at the ladies underwear on the line Louise is the town gossip chat with her as much as you like Ask her about the bras on her washing line Keep on talking about the bras Eventually she will throw them down to Gilbert a bit of embarrassment with princess Michelle ensues
Tie thebrastogether to form a primitivebungee cord Give thebungee cordto Eric the Brave and watch what happens Open the door to the Viking treasure chamber Unfortunately it s locked so you need the key Snorri the sad Viking said he had the key Go to the tavern again and try to get the key from him No dice
The only thing Snorri seems interested in is hunting a fearsome beast No ferocious beasts around but conversation with Snorri reveals some references to his feet boots an animal s hide etc Go to Saul the shoemaker at the townsquare There s a pair of fuzzy bunny slippers on his counter Talk to Saul and talk and talk Don t stop talking to him until he has introduced Sock and mentioned that he is sad for lack of a female companion Return to Gilbert s back garden and take thesockfrom the washing line if you haven t already done so Return to Saul s As soon as you left him a free sample of shoe polish materialized on his counter Pick up theshoe polish
In inventory combine theshoe polishwith thesockand obtain asock puppet Give thesock puppet Sockette to Saul as a present for Sock In return Saul gives you a present of a pair offuzzy bunny slippers Return to the tavern and give thefuzzy bunny slippersto Snorri You ll quite likely notice something new on his table which you can take now or leave until later Snorri moves to the bar now you can take his key to the secret Viking hideout You can t it s attached to his belt Go to Elton s workshop and look at the mysterious invention with the hose it s avacuum cleaner Pick it up Go to Gilbert s back garden If you haven t already done so have lots of fun looking and talking to the spelling bees Try taking some bees wax amp or honey The bees won t let you get close enough so use thevacuum cleaneron them Gilbert stores his vacuum cleanerthere
Gilbert grabs a little malleablebees waxand Grade A goldenhoneyfrom the beehive Return to the tavern you ll first release the trapped bees
Use thebees waxwith Snorri s key
You have now made a perfectkey imprintin the bees wax Go to Vandersteen the blacksmith near the City Gate NOTE You may have previously performed all of the actions which cause Vandersteen to leave his smithy Do not panic there are two ways to continue A You can perform other actions andeventuallythe blacksmith will return B Return to the save before he leaves and postpone his departure till later
Talk to Vandersteen if you wish and give him thekey imprint Vandersteen will make a proper key but only if Gilbert can get him a dog Take Vandersteen s blacksmith sglove Go to Sam the blind man outside Elton s and talk to him Take his seeing eye dog Naturally Sam panics and you return his dog You ll have to fool poor Sam with a fake dog Go to the farm and get thesack of wheat Use crazy Pete sswordand shear the sheep and have a good laugh
Pick up thewool Go to the dock location there s a barrel of tar outside the tavern Dip thegloveinto the tar you ll get atarred glove Transfer the tar from thetarred gloveto thesack of wheatand you get atarred sack of wheat Put thewoolon thetarred sack of wheatand you have afake dog Take thefake dogto Sam and exchange it for theseeing eyedog Give thedogto the blacksmith and he will happily make akeyout of the imprint Go to the secret Viking hideout Use thekeyon the door Pick up the treasure a lot of gold
and also a strangeViking ticket to an annual slave market Leave behind other interesting items Return to the Caveshop and givea lot of goldto Larry Unfortunately Larry smashes all of his precious crystal balls but he gives you acrowbarinstead You ll have to get your crystal ball somewhere else Go to the fortuneteller s but when Gilbert arrives there Madame Zyz is out Grab her crystal ball from the table No way
the Genie will not allow you to take it Talk to the Genie a lot of this dialog is not essential but he is a most amusing character You can leave him and return whenever you like but you MUST persist until eventually he will promise to make something appear by magic He will give you aglow in the dark pal He will also give you a lot of vital info concerning how long the crystal ball lasts etc Apparently Gilbert will have to travel into the future to that particular day when the crystal ball will stop working and Madame Zyz won t be able to see into the future Go and visit Elton the inventor Examine his various mysterious inventions including his strange statue which is a robot
Ask Elton if you can use his time machine He refuses Nag him and poke around his apparatus Elton will eventually agree to demonstrate the time machine There are some heavy boxes in front of the control panel so Elton commands his robot to lift move them out of the way But just as the robot starts to do this the drive belt on its back snaps You ll need a new drive belt for the robot Saul has a belt on his sewing machine But he won t let you take it You ll have to get Saul away from there Go to the tavern and look at the table where Snorri sat Pick up one of the tablenapkins
NOTE During the early parts of the game the napkin holder is empty You may have to perform other actions before it s full of napkins
The napkin has the tavern s ship logo on it and the logo looks just like a real Viking ship Go back to Pete s and slip thenapkinin front of his gun sight Tell Pete that the Vikings are invading Pete goes berserk watch the fun Saul a fellow member of the Phungorian Volunteer Army PVA will leave his shop and join his fellow comrade in arms Go down and pick up that good strong sewing drive belt Use the replacement belton the robot and it removes the heavy box Elton demonstrates his time machine It malfunctions Elton never returns a broken spring lies on the floor Pick up thebroken spring you ll have to repair it Maybe the blacksmith can help
NOTE You may have previously performed all of the actions which cause Vandersteen to leave his smithy This is of no real importance In this case you obviously cannot discuss with him nor will you have to get him to leave since you ve already done so But otherwise you can continue without hindrance Incidentally eventually Vandersteen will return
Give Vandersteen thebroken spring He says that only a certified clockmaker can repair such a fine spring Unfortunately there aren t any in Phungoria However because Gilbert insists on the blacksmith trying to mend it he presumably smashes it since it vanishes from your inventory But Vandersteen has suggested that maybe an old clock spring might work There s a cuckoo clock next to Gilbert s bed but you ll need a hammer to smash it Ask the blacksmith for his big sledgehammer he won t part with it and you re going to have to get him out of the way if indeed he s still there
To do this you have to involve Lipton if you haven t already done this
On the map go to the bridge and click on the mushroom pointer just under it Open the door and enter Lipton s house Lipton won t let you have the VIP card from the table you need this to get Vandersteen to leave his smithy Lipton talks and talks and talks about tea Make sure he mentions his wonderful unnamed tea Maybe you can drug him with it but you ll need items a special fine drinking filter some sweetener and some sleeping powder Get Arver s very fine germ mask filter He ll only let you have it if you give him a bottle of Dr Fraud s miracle medicine Talk to Dr Fraud through his wagon door He tells Gilbert that if he helps him start his next show Dr Fraud will give him a free bottle of his miracle medicine
Gilbert s got to make a fake weight bar to show how the miracle medicine makes a person strong Floating in the river outside Lipton s house are two of Pete s balsa wood cannonballs maybe you ve taken them already If not pick up thetwo cannonballs Go to the junk pile outside Elton s workshop and pick up the light aluminum metal bar In your inventory combine thecannonballsand thealuminum barto create afake weight bar Go back to Dr Fraud s wagon talk to him again andnowhe will begin his show Watch the cut scene of Dr Fraud defrauding After the show Dr Fraud will present Gilbert with a bottle of themiracle medicine He also gives Gilbert two bonus gifts a bottle ofstarchand theworld s smallest juice press You can look at the starch and examine thejuice press Grrrrr
Go to Arver and exchange themiracle medicinefor his ultra fine filter Give the filter to Lipton and he ll give Gilbert the key to the tea cabinet But Lipton will only drink the bitter unnamed tea if it s sweetened You ve probably got some sweetener by now in your inventory If not get some honey refer back to how you made Snorri s key imprint But the tea is still too bitter and Lipton spits it out You re going to have toreallytranquilize the old geezer Go to the docks and talk to Armand Hammer He says he s an undercover agent for the PBI Phungorian Bureau of Investigation impersonating a drug pusher
He ll persuade Gilbert to reluctantly accept some drugs onlysleeping powder In inventory mix thesleeping powderwith thehoneyand give thedrugged honeyto Lipton NOTE It s preferable not to perform the following steps earlier than necessary Although this is not absolutely essential it may save you unnecessary hassle later on There are additional notes on this in the appropriate places Take the VIP card and phone Vandersteen Leave and go to the blacksmith s he s no longer there borrow his hammer and promise to return it later Return to Gilbert s house smash the cuckoo clock and pick up itsspring Go to Elton s Put thespringinto the time machine Use the control panel You re now at Madame Zyz s but years into the future You can always return to the present via the time portal near the right edge of the screen Her front door is now locked but you can use the time machine as often as you like
Talk to her and try taking her broken crystal ball You ll need some generosity potion to get her to let you havethat Talk with Barry who has a stall at the Town Square Try to get him to demonstrate his generosity potion He ll only agree if you are prepared to sign a contract with him in case he gets TOO generous
You almost certainly got a full i e
inked pen from Elton s workshop If you didn t pick it up earlier take theink well also Enter the Sheriff s house alongside Madame Zyz s originally his door was locked
Open the chest there But it s locked so use yourcrowbaron it Look inside the chest and read thebook a paper flutters to the floor Pick up thepaper Return to Barry andnowhe will sign the contract However after drinking a little potion he generously tears up the contract and gives you a free sample thegenerosity potion Use the time machine again and go to Madame Zyz in the future Pour thegenerosity potioninto her perfume bottle She ll give you hercrystal balland also afeather duster Walk out through the time portal Go to the tavern and give thecrystal ballto Mr Davenport Watch the cut scene Davenport reluctantly allows Gilbert to borrow a small rowboat at the docks he uses it to follow the Sheriff from Phungoria to the island
E Getting the mushroom
Before you do anything else it s worth while talking to Elton until you find out what items you need to complete his raft This may seem premature since you are nowhere near ready to leave the island yet nor can you But you may not get an opportunity to do this later
You ll have to enter a cave blocked by thick iron bars too strong to bend or cut with tools Talk to the pirate captain If you talk long enough and rile him sufficiently the pirates will throw their glasses spectacles onto the ground Now they can hardly seeanything You can now pick up theirshovel Use theshovelon the sand to dig a hole under the bars You find atreasure chestwhich you pick up automatically Inside the cave it s dark and you can t do a thing Exit the cave via the hole you just dug and return to the beach Place theglow in the dark palon the hot white rock and you get afully charged glow in the dark pal Unfortunately it will only stay charged for minutes REAL time after that you ll have to keep on recharging it Use thefully charged glow in the dark palto light up the cave Solve the fairly easy slider puzzle which forms an upright mushroom it doesn t rearrange itself when recharging or even Saving One optimum solution is given below there are quite probably better solutions with maybe considerably less less moves than the outlined below

Ask the chef to make you some more jelly This time you ll get a big glob ofincredibly firm jelly Apply theincredibly firm jellyto the hole in thebroken liter bucket Gilbert Goodmate s shameless plug

Introduction lt lt lt IMPORTANT NOTICE READ ME FIRST There are two sections for each of the four years in thegame one for Questions and Answers with subtle hintsand pointers in the right direction and then a fullwalkthrough for each year
If you play through the game using this document as yourguide IT WILL RUIN THE GAME FOR YOU A lot of solutions topuzzles won't make any sense and you'll miss out on a lotof the game I strongly suggest using this guide only as alast resort when you're stuck on a puzzle and then usingonly the section pertaining to your puzzle Reading aheadwill spoil the game Trust me II
Gameplay Frequently Asked Questions lt lt lt Q
Can I die in Grim Fandango A
You're already dead silly Q
Okay let me rephrase that Is it possible for me to screw up so badly that I have to restart the game A
No Like most other LucasArts adventures you can't mess up so badly that you have to go back to an earlier saved game or restart the entire game Every puzzle has a solution no matter how long it takes for you to get it Q
What if I say the wrong thing to someone A
No problem Just talk to them again and pick the right one You can go through every single dialog option in the game and you'll eventually stumble across the right thing to say Q
The elevator door won't open What do I do A
Back up and walk towards the elevator slowly Q I can't get out the door especially in the Tube Switching room A
The Tube Switching room among others is horribly picky about letting you out the door Just keep trying turning moving forward backing up and eventually you'll get out Hopefully this will be addressed in a patch at some point Q
In Year Three the game keeps crashing when I walk around the crane What do I do A
Upgrade your video driver If you're using a Voodoo or Voodoo card the game will get very glitchy right here if you don't have the latest drivers Q
The longer I play the worse performance gets in the game What's wrong A
I don't know Same thing happened to me Maybe you should tell LucasArts about it III
VERY Frequently Asked Questions lt lt lt These are the questions that I've now received four or five times so far They also illustrate the danger of using a walkthrough without any regardto the order in which the steps are very clearly spelled out
Year Two Q I printed up a ticket handed it to the guy at the photo counter and he told me it was fake Why A Because you're not at the photo counter you're at the ticket counter The photo finish counter is opposite the ticket counter Q I need a lawyer for the bees but Nick is missing Where is he A Nick will not return until you have gotten the incriminating photo from the photo finish counter
