Copyright GIMLI GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solution
Walkthrough by Tally HoWinter Pay attention to the story Nathaniel tells in the introductory movie
Keepsake is a tightly knit story which is gradually revealed throughout the play ending with a meaningful conclusion
You will meet Mustavio first of all who will give you a brief tutorial on the game's interface
one of the most important things he tells you is that help is always available by clicking on the Question Mark button at the lower left of the screen
Any time you are attempting to solve a puzzle it will give you a series of hints
The First Hints tell you the object of the puzzle the Second Hints give you more details and the Third Hints tell you as much as possible without revealing the solution
If you still can't figure out the puzzle the final option is to simply give you the solution
If you are NOT in the middle of a puzzle but rather meandering around wondering what to do next the Help button will tell you what you need to do next and where
It does not however tell you how to get there
That's where I come in
Finding your way around the school is half the battle
It's a very large environment and it takes some getting used to
I will be following the game in the same sequence that thebuilt in walkthroughuses
That way you can mostly follow it and will only need to refer to this one for navigational help or further assistance with the puzzles
Actually the game is linear in some respects and very much non linear in others A word about saves You can save as often as you want but there are only eight slots
So of you save twelve times for example your first four saved games have disappeared
Also there is no quot Load quot option
If you need to return to a previously saved position you will need to Quit or save and quit and quot Continue quot into the saved game of your choice
Do not expect to be able to ask for a saved game from any of the forums they will not be available
You don't need them anyway since you canobtain the solution to any puzzleright from the game itself
Your first order of business is tofind Mustavio again and have a discussion with him
You can actually leave this part out until much later and it's more efficient to do so but eventually you will need to talk with him
After he leaves go straight ahead toward the water fall then toward the school
After you find the entrance locked go down the steps and to the right into the forest
Follow the path until you come to Mustavio and talk with him about everything
As with all adventure games you must complete every conversation thread
He says that he wants you to find his barrels of wine
He also wants you to buy some figurines you will need for a game but you have no money
Return to the Academy
You need to unlock those big doors somehow
Climb the steps to the fountain where Celeste had promised to meet you
Find the button to press on the fountain which rotates a mechanism and reveals a simple puzzle
Use the Help button to see what the button on the fountain looks like if you have trouble finding it
The four Minotaurs stand up when you touch them
After they all stand up the four bells descend one at a time
The bells always descend in the same sequence and the Minotaurs attempt to strike them but in the sequence you chose to touch them
If you watch the bells
you will know the order to touch the Minotaurs
Upper Right Lower Left Upper Left Lower Right
The doors open and your next task is to enter the school
You should always feel free to poke around and explore
You can't do any harm by doing things out of order and you can't quot die quot Whenever you feel stuck the built in help will guide you to the next necessary step
If you accomplish a task out of sequence no problem it is automatically dropped out of the help
Looking into the Grand Hall you see a large Dragon Statue a Rose Window above the statue and two large staircases
The stairs are connected by a cross hallway at the top and it will only be necessary ever to go up the right side
For now however don't go upstairs instead go toward the right stairs and around behind them
Enter the Machine Room Walkway and continue into the Store Room
You hear a strange sound
You must free Zak
Look at the Help to see how
You can have a conversation with Zak before or after you set him free
Look close up at the door then press the blue magical lock above it
Meet Zak mighty dragon er Wolf
Lydia tries to leave the storeroom but you have something else to do before you go
There is akey ringyou need in the cabinet you just opened
Zak will remind you to take it but only this once
Open the left hand door to find them
If you have been exploring on your own and found all the doors locked this will change that now you can open everything except that large gate in the main hall
Return to the main hall and climb the large stairs on the right
At the top you are facing a long bookcase
Turning left takes you into a short dead end
Turn right
Look at this picture
I'm going to call this place theUpper Landing in order to be able to quickly refer to it later
Find the small hotspot just at the arm of the chair to give you a view over the railing
Go down those narrow steps
At the bottom is a brown staircase
Don't go down there yet
Make a U turn at the bottom and proceed up the green steps and across the Dark Green floor
This is the Enchanted Hallway
You are looking for a torn book lying on the floor
It's possible that Zak may be standing in the way and you can't see it
If that's the case use the Help button to see where it is
Take the Book
It's in a language you cannot read
Incidentally Lydia and Zak will have several spontaneous conversations throughout the game
They are triggered as you cross certain locations
They also occur if you stand around doing nothing for a stretch of time
If you have one of these conversations because you are idle then it won't get triggered by a location so they are somewhat unpredictable
I won't include any mention of them here
Next walk across the footbridge leading from the Enchanted Hallway
You need tofind the Garden
At the end of the footbridge you see several wooden benches
Go right until you come to the last bench
Ahead is a stairway and a level path
Take the path
Go down the stairs
Explore further into the Garden
An automatic scene unfolds as Zak finds Celeste's Doll
Caution have at least five uninterrupted minutes available while Lydia has a Vision
You can't stop the Vision while it's in progress but you could repeat it if you need to
It's stored in your inventory
Every time Lydia has a vision she ends up in an unexpected location
It's as if she was sleepwalking
You need togo to the Basement next
To get there return to the Garden
Up the right stairs turn right find the small hotspot and the narrow staircase you took before through the Enchanted Hallway the footbridge the path down the steps and turn toward where the Doll was
Continue along the Garden Path until you come to the entrance to the Basement
Go on in it's not locked
Go down the steps
Eeek
Zak the Mighty Dragon is afraid of ghosts
Go to the hotspot at the top of the screen and find the next staircase down
Through the archway and look forMustavio's crates
Click on them to gain knowledge about them
Now you must find the other exit
Return through the archway and down the next steps
If you are really observant you will notice a large owl sitting there at the left watching everything you and Zak do Click here to see the Owl
You will see a double archway one with steps leading down and one with a flat floor
Remember this location for you will need to return here later to open a magical door
Go down the steps for now and continue through the basement rooms
You will find abroken place in the wall
Step through the opening
Oops Oh No
Lydia trips or falls or something and breaks the Pendant
Continue on toward the Water Wheel
As you step out into the open before going down any steps you can see some flowers growing in the shade
You will need to return here to pick some later
Go around the corner from the Water Wheel and find the puzzle with twoLead Weights
Here's how it works Each wooden disk serves to raise its weight up as far as it will go
The outer lever lowers the weight as far as it will go
The inner lever connects the weight's mechanism together and lowers the one it's attached to while raising the other
Neither weight can exceed its upper or lower limit
The blue jewel at the top will reset everything and the Rune in the center is the switch to press when you have aligned the weights correctly
The object is to align both weights with the blue lights flanking the channels

Raise the Right side Wooden disk
Pull the Inner Lever on the Right Weight lowering it partway and raising the Left side
Pull the Outer lever on the Left Weight lowering it all the way
Pull the Inner Lever on the Right Weight lowering it the rest of the way and raising the Left one to one step below the final mark
Raise the Right side Wooden disk
Now the left is one too low and right is one too high
Pull the Inner Lever on the Right lowering it and raising the left
Now they are aligned
Press the Rune on the Center column
You did it
Now you have a bit of a puzzle to get the power distributed to all the machinery Go to the Machine Room You can enter it right there just go past the Water Wheel and enter the Wooden Door
If you explored before and tried to exit that door from the inside you couldn't because those tools were jamming it
Go down the steps and look at the strange console on a pedestal
You see a diagram on the stone surface with gears circles lines connecting everything and the numbers I II and III on the diagram and on the outer rim
Obviously you need to select I II or III on each of the eight consoles but how do you decide
The Roman numbers indicate how the power will flow
The power comes from the source represented by the uppermost symbol on the diagram
Hence you are looking at the last controller in the series
How you set this one depends on where the power will be coming from the left side or the right
Both are possible there are at least four solutions
You should try to work it out it's fun
Only took me half a day
Let's figure out how to describe the diagram
You have an upper Triangle a lower Triangle and between them a Rectangle
The Rectangle has upper left upper center upper right points and also three lower points
Looking at this the last controller the numerals are around the point of the lower triangle
Thus if you select III the power would come from the lower right corner of the rectangle and go to the final machine
If you select II the power would come from the lower left of the rectangle and go to the machine
If however you select I the power would pass between the lower corners of the rectangle and be useless
I suggest you find the first controller rather than the last
Proceed further into the room
You will see another controller there and walk past it until you come to some steps going up and down
Go down
There is the first controller on the lowest level
If you set it on I power is sent to the upper left machine on the rectangle
If you set it on II power is sent instead to the upper right machine
Either way is correct but it affects how you set the others
Either way you will want to go all the way upstairs to set the next one
Oh and you must activate the machines One At a Time
If you send power back to a machine that already has power it shorts out the circuit and you must start over
Sorry
One possible route is Source point of upper triangle Upper left center and right of rectangle lower right center and left of rectangle point of lower triangle then final machine
To get that route find the controllers in that order and set them so I II I III I III III and II
If you get clever and try to set these controllers before the power to the Water Wheel is connected it won't quot Take quot and you will have to set them again
The path the current takes will be this one Now you have restored power to the gates magical doors and other devices throughout the school
Return to the main hall
The easiest way is to climb to the top level of the machine room and return through the storeroom where Zak was trapped
In the Main Hall you can now open the gate the one you found yourself standing before following the first Vision
Pull the lever and climb the stairs
Lydia has another vision
After the vision Lydia has been sleepwalking again
This time she is further up the stairs so don't turn back but go all the way to the top
Lydia knocks on the door and the Guardians speak
You will automatically meet the guardians
After the cutscene click on one of them to start a conversation
You learn about the three Trials Allegiance Wisdom and Triumph
Following the conversation you must descend the stairs and find the Key to the Caretaker's Office on the floor partway down the stairs
Down down and down
Pass the Stained Glass window and down again
The key is on the landing
Pick it up and notice the number etched on it
Now go downstairs all the way to the bottom and into the Main Hall
Take either the Left or Right stairs up to the crossover First landing and use the brass key to enter the Caretaker's Office
Look at the Old Parchment on the Desk
Also read the rolled up note on the desk
Then look behind you and to the left
Find the Wooden Staff
Finally look in the other corner and look close up at the safe
You can probably guess the combination but entering it might prove tricky since moving one of the tumblers changes others
Read the hints if you need to
This is a simple puzzle if you understand how it works and darned near impossible if you don't
Begin by solving the th digit then solve the one affected by the th one
The th tumbler changes the nd one
Still confused
Fix them in this order
You never have to touch the first one
In plain English click x on x on x on and x on
Twist the key at the upper right and take the precious Tiara
It allows you to read the magical language
Open your inventory and read the torn notebook
Then return downstairs to the Great Hall and read the plaque attached to the Dragon Statue
Checking the Help the next instruction could be confusing
It says you must open the Allegiance Trial Doorbelow the Enchanted Hallway Footbridge
Don't go the Enchanted Hallway itself that's the way to the Garden
Instead go through the Gate you recently opened and up the first big flight of stairs
Turn right at the top to find the correct magical door
Lydia will open it with her staff
If this doesn't happen and if Zak says quot You can't open it it's Magical quot you need to climb the stairs all the way to the top and ask the Guardians how to open the doors
Then return to this door and try again
Enter the door and click on the three headed stone beast to undergo the Trial of Allegiance
Answer the three questions Wisdom Power and BalanceTimeWithout Wisdom Power has no meaning
Now it's time to find the Second Trial it's a bit of a trek
Go downstairs to the Great Hall and up the Right Staircase to the top
Turn right as usual then go through the archway and up the next stairs to door at the top
Exit the door and go left past the large Rose Window
Oops Zak doesn't like it here
He's afraid of heights Mighty Dragon that he says he is
Well that's too bad You have work to do
Go past the window around the next corner and into the first door you find
Here is another foot bridge
At the other end of the bridge is the door you are looking for
Halfway across are some more pages torn from the notebook
Read them
Open the magical door
Oops the test is on the other side and you can't get there from here
You will have to gotalk with Mustavioin the forest
Just reverse the path you took to get here and exit the School
Take the forest path until you find Mustavio
Ask him to repair the Pendant
He needs some parts
The tools on the shelf in the store room are just what he needs
He also wants to know where his Crates and Wine Barrels are
You have already found the Crates but the Wine is locked behind a charmed door
You must return to the Cellar and figure out how to open that door
The clue is the paper you picked up from the Caretaker's Desk
Return to the School
Up the right staircase down the narrow stairs across the footbridge down and out into the garden then into the Cellar
Down three flights of stairs and toward the two arches we mentioned before
Around back of the items stored there is the door which is magically locked
You must select the letters in the proper sequence in order to open the door
Apparently from the clue you need to press six bricks in a row
The clue gives youm b
f
x Each letter you press gives you three new ones
m csb c xms s brk b xtr x msk k fcb r tfx t fmk
Pressing m b t f c x opens the door
Enter the Winecellar
Go up the short stairs and to the right tofind the barrelsMustavio wants
Next you need to provide a way across the river for him
Exit the Winecellar and go further down into the basement as before taking the exit through the broken wall where she dropped the pendant and go out past the water wheel and beyond the weights puzzle
Down the steps and follow the path along the river
Lydia has another Vision
Following the vision you are much farther into the woods than when it started
You can go ahead one more step and talk with the tree if you like but the program's built in help wants you to build a bridge instead
So go back the way you came crossing a small wooden bridge and find theStrange Signpost Touch the vine and watch the bridge grow
Amazing
Cross the bridge and tell Mustavio you found the wine barrels
He will give you the figurines a minotaur and a goblin
Return to the school go up the right stairs right at the top and down the narrow stairs
U turn up the green steps across the footbridge and go to the Minotaur Maze game at the left
To get the Goblin into the stairs you must figure out how to move so as to trap the Minotaur behind the barriers
He gets two moves to your one but you are more clever than he is Move up twice down x right x up x left once up x right x up once and continue left to the exit
You receive aNigilis seed
You need to plant the seed
Leave the Maze game and go to the garden
As you descend into the garden go straight ahead and up the other stairs do not make the U turn that takes you toward the Cellar Door
Past the dragon statue and across the other little stone bridge
Plant the Seed
Look at the symbols surrounding the circular planting area
You need to be able to recognize this one the Nature Rune
Now return to the Dragon Statue you just passed and find the Magical Light puzzle on its octagonal base
By manipulating the sliding buttons you will be able to produce theMagical Lightrequired by the tree
The pattern you produce will look like the above symbol
Use the second knob on the left and the second and third knobs on the right
Now the seed needs water
Return to the interior of the school via the footbridge by the maze puzzle and go to the foot of the narrow stairs
Remember I said there was a brown stairs descending from that area but not to go there yet
Now's the time to solve the water works puzzle
Go down those steps and into the Pump Room
Open the box Number the gears as if they were a slider puzzle which it's not through
Swap the gears thus
Test your result by pulling the lever at the right side of the puzzle
If some of the gears spin but not all you messed up something
You can either figure it out or reset the puzzle with the blue gem at the left
If theyall spin and the box closes you got it right
Go down to the bottom of the pump room and pull the lever to start the water flowing throughout the school
If you got clever and tried to solve this puzzle before the Water Wheel was connected it won't quot take quot and you will need to do it again
Return to the Garden and pull the lever in front of the growing area to raise the water level
Say the magic words and Presto Change o there's your basic Nigilis tree
Now you need to get to that balcony to retrieve a fruit
The Help says to solve the puzzle of the locked door in the Nightingale Study
If you have been an intrepid explorer you might have been there done that but if you are closely following their help or mine you have not seen it yet and would not have a clue how to find it
Here's the route Re enter the school and to as far as the top of the narrow stairs
Don't go down to the Great Hall but rather into the archway and up to the balcony where Zak was afraid of heights
This time pass the wooden door Where the second Trial was and around the corner into the room without a closed door
Read the plaque on the floor describing Nightingale
On the left wall of the room is a door locked with a simple puzzle
You must exchange the left and right pieces to unlock it
We have all seen this puzzle before
If you can't do it on your own and I believe you can also check the built in help for the rules number the pieces thus Green Pieces White Pieces Click on the pieces in the following order G W W G G G W W W G G G W W G There that should move all the pieces to the other side and the door opens
Enter the door which takes you to a wrap around balcony
Go around the building until you are reach the Nigilis Tree andpick a fruit
Then enter the open doorway right next to you
This is WinterOwl's study
Take the torn pages from the table and read them
Also read the metal plaque on the floor
Return to the building proper by taking the wrap around balcony
You might see Mustavio crossing a footbridge below
You need to talk to him and he can be found in the Enchanted Crossway
Outside again to the first balcony then down the steps to theUpper Landing Take the Narrow Stairs down and around and instead of going ahead to the green stairs turn right into a small alcove
Talk to Mustavio
He will generously repair the broken pendant if you bring him the tools
The tools can be found on a shelf in the Store Room
To get there up the narrow stairs to the Upper Landing then down the Right Stairs and around back to the Store Room where you first found Zak
Take the tools and retrace your path to Mustavio
Give him the tools and he fixes the musical Locket
Exit the front of the school and take the path through the forest to the place where Mustavio and his wagon were originally
He's not there now
Cross the vine bridge and go right at the other side
Go as far as you can and talk with Elvandar
He gives you aHeaden Flower which looks sort of like a Pansy on steroids
It's time to find the Dining Room Kitchen area
Return to the school via either route
Across the vine bridge and on to the front door is one way or you can stay on this side of the river and enter the bottom level of the machine room and climb up to the ground floor that way
In any case go up to the Upper Landingand down the narrow stairs and outside as if you are going to the Garden
Take the stairs up instead of the level path
At the top is a door leading into the Dining Room
The Dinner Hall has two levels go down to the lower level and find the papers on the table
The page describesYewlock Leaves which grow in the dark
Have you seen some plants growing in a deeply shaded area
Go pick the leaves
Shortcut go through the Kitchen and right into the pantry
On the back wall is a dumbwaiter a sort of lift
Use it to descend into the Winecellar
Exit the Winecellar into the basement proper and down to the lowest level and exit the broken wall
When you get to the waterway don't go down the steps to the water wheel but look for someflowers growing in the shadebehind the large barrels
Take some Yewlock leaves
Now it's time to brew a potion in the kitchen for Zak
Have a look at the magical fireplace in the kitchen
You need a cauldron
I saw one in the Winecellar
Go back down there
Ooof
It's way too heavy to carry
Maybe we can get it to the lift somehow
Go to thelowest levelof the Winecellar
There is a sort of ramp lift there
Pull the lever to lower it
Go up to the Winecellar and push the Cauldron onto the platform
Go back down and pull the lever again raising the platform
Now you can shove the cauldron into the dumbwaiter
You can send the hoist up by pressing the blue button or you can go up to the kitchen and use that blue button to call the lift
Anyway you need to take the long way around because you can't all fit into the hoist Climb all the cellar stairsto the top and you will be in the garden area
From there you can go up the steps into the dining hall
Go to the lift and take the cauldron to the fireplace
Brew the potion for Zak
He keels over
Lydia has another sad vision this one is where Celeste's mother is dying and her father feels frustration at not being to help her
The vision ends and Lydia has gotten to the first trial door at the end of the footbridge somehow
When she goes to find Zak she is surprised by aSiamese cat who turns out to be none other than Zak himself
Lydia wants him to shudder walk across the roof to the broken window
To get there Zak must exit one of thewindows in the Pantry Re enter the building down to the Upper Landing down the narrow stairs and out to garden exit
Up the stairs into the Dining Room and through the kitchen into the Pantry Facing the lift look at the table on the left side of the room
Send Zak out the window
Watch the cutscene as Zak overcomes his fears and you and he will wind up in the second Trial Room on opposite sides
He will start out one level higher than you
This puzzle isVery Confusingbecause the view keeps switching in a way that it's difficult to tell who's on which side
You need to cooperate in order to get Lydia to the test site which is directly across from where she is standing I think
Lydia looks at the lever and says quot Let's have Zak try something quot switching control to Zak
Zak looks at his lever and says quot I'll try this lever quot raising the bridge to Zak's level
Zak walks across the bridge
Zak pulls the lever on the other side
Zak looks at the lever and says quot Let's have Lydia try something quot
Lydia climbs upstairs and switches to Zak
Zak pulls the lever
Zak switches to Lydia
Lydia pulls the lever
This is the only time Lydia actually pulls a lever
Lydia switches to Zak
Zak goes downstairs and pulls the lever
He pulls the same lever again
Zak switches to Lydia
Lydia goes downstairs and switches to Zak
Zak pulls the lever and the way to theTrial puzzle is open
The left lever rotates the bottom plinth revealing four vague poems The right lever rotates the top turntable and reveals eight runes as follows Slund the spiritualUndar waterAetern celestialDria natureGradion energyKyros fireNexan movement
Your job is to figure out which poem represents which rune and match them
Press the jewel underneath the book to place it on the plinth
Howling out of sight Aetern the celestial When around me Kyros the fire Hard as rock Dria the nature It's everywhere Slund the spiritual
When you place the fourth book correctly you see a cutscene where the second guardian is satisfied and turns his back on the rune on the floor
The door to the third trial is partway up the Whispering stairs that leads to the Guardians
Open that door and take the third test the Trial of Triumph
It's not a puzzle just a test of your determination and willingness to overcome your worst fear
In this case Lydia relives the scene where she was trapped in a burning house and was rescued by Nathaniel
Except this time there's no Nathaniel
She must make up her mind to enter the flaming house herself
Just keep selecting the door and the window andeventually she'll do it The third Guardian steps back and you will be able to enter the upper region of the school
Go upstairs to the Guardians
They are satisfied and will let you pass
The cutscene ends with you and Zak landing in a large classroom
You must find and visitCeleste's room
Go left and up onto the blue and yellow floor and her room is in the upper right
Enter have a conversation with Zak and lock him in
The scene ends in another vision and you will find yourself at the red transporter in the Laboratory
Take the short footbridge into the lab and there is Zak
Ask him everything
After the scene ends step further into the lab and read the metal plaque on the wall
You learn something about potion making
Exit the side door of the lab and use the yellow transporter
That takes you to a kind of way station tower with only another yellow teleporter
Use it to go to the main Teleport Hub
Now take the black teleporter from there to the Teleporter Control Room
There are four controlling obelisks you can look close up at and make adjustments to power up the teleporters
The object is to get all three lights in all three colors working
Number the obelisks thus Lower left Upper left Upper Right Lower right Go to Obelisk and turn it once
Thisswitches everything off
This will give you a good starting point in case they get mixed up because you like to experiment
If you get mixed up turn each obelisk to its off position and start over
To solve it turn once again then turn three times three times and twice
Now that you have powered up all the teleporters there will be no reason to return to this room
Use the teleporter to return to the Hub and take the Red Teleporter from there to a waystation containing a red teleporter and a magic transmitter door
Step through the door and you find yourself on the outside of a tower
It looks like it might have been designed by Escher part of it is sideways
Walking straight ahead will turn you sideways don't go there yet but up and to the right into theArt Classroom
Examining this room reveals several things
Ahead are five display cases each containing several pieces of artwork
It is possible to look close up at each piece of art
To your right is another piece of furniture where you can place artwork
It's a puzzle for which you do not have the clues yet
Further right to the right of the window is aRune on the wall
Press it in spite of what Zak says
Finally in the lower left corner of the room you can see some paint cans and an unfinished painting on an easel
It's another puzzle for which you do not have the clues yet
Exit the room and go down those stairs that will turn you sideways
You come to another Portal
Take it and you are on the Watch Tower also called the North Tower
Climb the steps to the top and you find red and yellow teleporters a puzzle that isn't activated yet and a strange floating ball over the stairs
Take the Yellow teleporter to the Statue Tower
Explore the tower if you like but you need to take the footbridge leading toNathaniel's office
On the way you get a brief reminder that you are in a sideways world
Does that mean that Nathaniel is a lateral thinker
LOL Go around to the business side of the desk and take the notes
They reveal something about the Orb that Zak was forced to retrieve for Nathaniel
There is much more to do here in the office but return instead to the Statue tower
Take the Blue teleporter to go up up up to the Observatory
You need toactivate the Runeon the wall
That's all you can do in the Observatory for now
Return to the Watch Tower via the Statue Tower and take the footbridge over to the Library
Oh
That dratted owl stole the Caretaker's Circlet
Watch the cutscene as Lydia and Zak travel to the Sacred Hall via a hidden Portal
You will need to remember where that Portal is later
On the other side she gets the Circlet back and meets with Grandmaster Nightingale
Talk with him about everything
Okay now you have the setup for this chapter
You need to locate andretrieve four magical items
In addition you need to learn how totransform Zak into a human and locate the ingredients to make his potion
You will no doubt encounter some puzzles on the way
Use the Portal to return to the Library Tower
Just for reference inspect the wall behind you in order to see where the Portal is hidden for later use
Return to the Watch Tower
You might have inspected the game located at the center of the tower but it didn't work
You need tode activate the Protection Spellby saying the magic words to the ball and rings device
Dragonus Enferinis
Now the game will be active
The objective is to illuminate all the lights surrounding the tiles
Each row column and diagonal must contain one each of the four symbols Planet Star Sun and Moon
There are many correct solutions
Here's just one Take the Red Teleporter then the next red one to arrive at the original Large Classroom
Go to the other end of the room and take the Yellow Teleporter arriving in the Student Lounge
Find the game quot Dragon's Lair quot You can unlock it by saying the magic words to the lock which is at the lower right corner
Bear with me this is a TEDIOUS game
It takes over sixty moves to plod through
The good news is if you make an error it's easy to overcome unlike a game such as Hanoi Towers where if you slip up once you're kaput
Do you really want to grind through this Click Here for a solution My choice would be to cop out and ask the hint system to solve it for me
Especially since I really did solve it last week and don't want to have to repeat it heh heh After you finish this puzzle and procure theAleunder Root take the Yellow Transporter back to the main classroom and go beyond the area where Celeste's room is into the Atrium
You must visit the Herbalism Classroom also called the Solarium it has a large tree growing in the middle of it
To get there continue through the Atrium until you see an arched doorway on the left
You want the doorway on the RIGHT which you can't see from here Activate the runeon the wall
Now it's time to visit the Forge
Exit the Solarium and go through the opposite door into the stairway complex
Go up the stairs to find two more stairways
Go up therightone to find a Blue Teleporter
Take it to the Forge Room Activate the runeon the right hand wall
Then inspect the puzzle high above your head on the same wall
That's all in the forge for now you will be returning here later
Exit via the Blue Teleporter and go down the steps to the landing where there are two staircases
Go between them
Down down until you come to the first stone leading to the Oracle
Say Dragonus Enferinis to the ball and rings and the puzzle begins
The first stone is marked with a code three vertical lines II Iindicates Off On On
This means you should not toggle the light on by clicking this first stone
If you turned it on turn it off again before you go ahead to the next island or you will have to come back and start anew
Once you de activated the spell anew bridgeappeared on the right
Take it and as you reach the next island that bridge vanishes and a new one appears
Click on the stone and click on the dragon symbol to light it
Continue on
Turn on the third stone and go to the fourth
Here you get a new code On On Off
So turn this one on and proceed
Fifth is already on turn sixth off
Seven get a new code On On Off Off
Turn this one on
Eight is where you started ignore the original code now it's obsolete
turn it on Nine off Ten is off leave it
Eleven get a new code On Off On Off
Turn it on
Twelve ignore the obsolete code turn it off Thirteen on Fourteen is off leave it
Fifteen there's your Dragon Skeleton
Click on the fossil and receive a handful of magical Moss for your efforts
I always like to save the game after a lengthy puzzle just in case of a crash or something
Now you have enough ingredients tobrew a potion
Go to the Lab
Shortest way is to go to the two staircases and climb the left one where you will find a Red Teleporter
Take it to the Lab and click on the apparatus to brew a potion
Use the recipe containing the Oracle Moss
Zak becomes a Dragon
If you use the other recipe he becomes a wolf instead
It's time to go to the Library
Return to the Watch Tower thus Take the Yellow Teleporters from the lab to the Hub then the Red Teleporters and the Portals to the Watch Tower
From there it's the footbridge into the Library
Lydia suggests going to the Forge which you certainly can but I suggest the Library instead since that's where the built in walkthrough takes you
First thing to do is to pick up theMagical Ball
Its on the center post in the banister
The ball is used to open the doors into other rooms
Let's say this is the North side of the room
Green Red Light Blue Ball Ball Ball Ball Blue Gold There are four Magical Balls in all and you need to find another one right now so as to be able to enter rooms that require two stones to open their doors
From the place where you take the first stone look at the wall beyond
You see a blank stone door flanked by two panels
The left panel has a gothic arch niche on it
This would be the West side of the room
Click there
It opens and you can place the stone in its holder opening the door to the next room
Take the new ball from its holder and exit back into the Main Room
Retrieve your original ball from the niche and go now to the opposite side the East side of the room
Use your two balls to open that door
Enter and take the third magical ball
You can use it to open the door on the North wall of this room taking you to the Bright Blue chamber
Go to the far side of the room and look close up at the tapestry
You will retain a copy of it in your inventory
If you study the pattern you see four different runes displayed in four different colors
More on that later
Exit this room take back the ball and exit again and take back both balls
You are in the Main Room again
You've gone East and West You will go West once more but for now go South the door you would face coming up the stairs
Enter the marble colored room and have Lydia turn right West
Open that door into the Brown Beige room and take the fourth Ball
Exit and retrieve both balls and go to the other East side of this same room
Open it and examine the Tapestry on the far wall of the Blue Gold room
It seems to be a riddle
Exit and exit taking back all balls
Re enter the West room the first one you entered before and go into the room North of it
This room is decorated in Red and the Tapestry shows the names of the four elements in English and Runic
Exit and exit retrieving the balls as usual
Finally go into the North room which is Blue White and into the room North of that decorated in Green
Take the final tapestry which appears to display various plant species which are compatible or not with each other
Exit and exit
Before you leave double check your inventory to insure you have all four balls in your possession
You will be needing them later
Exit the Library and walk back to the Watch Tower and take the Yellow Teleporter to the Statue Tower also called Fountain Room
De activate the ball ring lock found next to the transporter
Now you can use the Season Changer the large glass orb left of the statues
It serves to alter the seasons in the Herbology Classroom
I suggest setting it to Winter and leaving it there but I won't tell you why yet
Now take the blue teleporter up to the Observatory
Fasten your seatbelts there is one Doozy of a puzzle coming
Remember if you start pulling your hair out you can always bag it and ask the game to solve it for you
Think of the satisfaction if you actually DO solve it
Hey I had to
I wrote all this long before the game was released and there was no WT to refer to
Go up the first set of stairs and use the Constellation viewer
There areeight constellations consisting of stars each
If you expect to complete this puzzle yourself without looking at the spoiler take notesand make reasonablyaccurate sketchesof the constellations
You will see them again through the telescope but without names or drawings superimposed on them
Then go up the next stairs where the Telescope is
When you go to the telescope the sky should turn to night
If it doesn't step on the Moon tile on the floor
BEFORE you start playing with the rings read thefirst and second hints They describe the action of the rings and tell you vaguely how to understand the coordinates
There are four vertical sets and four horizontal
What you need to do is decide which sets of coordinates you want and which you do not use
The clue comes from the quot First Tapestry quot taken from the Library
It's the one with the Riddle on it
The four couplets each hint at one of the constellations
quot Gift of Life

quot is for theMermaid referring specifically to her navel quot the Strongest quot refers to theMinotaurand his massive biceps quot Poisoned quot refers to the stinger on theManticor lion scorpion and quot Feathery quot refers to theGriffin's wings
Now deciding which sets of coordinates to use can only be done by trying them all and looking at the telescope each time and comparing them with your sketches
When the telescope is correctly aimed at a constellation you can click on each star and illuminate its corresponding number on the circle
You should however only light up the number that is represented by the appropriate body part
Now for building the constellations you must get all four numbers of the desired coordinate onto the same row
It can be any one of the four rows but they do not have to be in sequence
Rotate the golden ball so that it indicates the row you have assembled
Then look in the telescope
If you have aimed it at a constellation it will be visible
Then select the appropriate star to illuminate the one correct number
The four sets of numbers you must use are
The Mermaid
Select in the scope
The Minotaur
Select
The Manticor
Select
The Griffin
Select
Careful you must not have any other numbers illuminated except those four
When you get it right you receive an object for your efforts
It is a piece of ameteoriteenclosed in a magical container
It's one of the four elements you are seeking which will unlock the Sanctuary
Go down two flights of stairs and take the Blue Teleporter back to the Fountain Room Statue Tower and cross the footbridge toNathaniel's office
Dragonus Enferinis
De activate the lock and examine the Ship in a Bottle
Whoa
You are inside the bottle
Clicking on the bottle now lets you see the quot treasure map quot clicking on the bottle next to the map takes you back to the office clicking on the back arrow returns you to the boat inside the bottle clicking on thelittle doorunder the Poop Deck will take you to the puzzle
You must try to follow the path as indicated on the map
It's pretty obvious what to do
Upper LeftUpper RightLower RightUpper RightUpper LeftUpper LeftUpper Right
You are in a virtual quot Nathaniel's Office quot Go behind the desk andopen the drawer
First click unlocks it second click opens it
Click on the bottle to return to the real office
Now you will be able to pull open the desk drawer
Take thePortrait of Celeste Open the drawer AGAIN and press the blue button
Asecret Teleporteris revealed
Take it to the Secret Room
Find the handwritten note on the desk
Then attempt to de activate the ball ring lock
It doesn't work
You need to try it now in order to get the correct password from the Master
Now that you have Celeste's portrait you can work on the puzzle in theArt Room From the office to the Fountain Room to the Watchtower Yellow through one Portal to the Turn tower and into the Art Room
You need to create a painting in order to continue
Click on the easel
It expects you to use four colors in the correct sequence
Have a look at the tapestry from the Library See the Rune at the bottom
Find the four Runes that match it and use the colors from top to bottom Red Yellow Blue Green in that order
The painting magically jumps to its frame in the display case
Go take it
Notice as you take it there is agreyed out square in the upper rightof your screen depicting the Easels
Click on the square to go to the easels and place the landscape in the left easel
Now there will be a square at the upper left depicting the niches
Click on the square to return to the niches
Do not return to the art room itself for that will reset your puzzle
You must selecttwo compatible paintingsfrom the niches and place them on the easels
If you choose wisely they will magically transform into two new paintings
For example dragons are connected with Fire
Pick the painting of theFire Rune and the sleeping Dragon
Place them in the easels and you now have a Nature Rune and a flying Dragon
Click on the Nature Rune to return it to the niche and leave the flying Dragon in the easel
Return with thelandscapeyou created a short time ago and place it in the empty easel creating pictures of a closer view of the Academy and a stylized Dragon
Take the Dragon back to the niche and return with the silhouette figure Grim Reaper
and you will have pictures of Celeste's Mother and Elvandar's forest
Take the forest picture to the niche and return withCeleste's portrait
You will see a shooting star picture briefly then receive another of the four elements
This one is filled with quot Soul Dust quot Return to the forge
Get there by going around the turn tower through the Portal to the Watch Tower and take the Red teleporter to the large classroom
Then through the atrium and the stairs complex up the right side to the Blue teleporter
You might have an automatic conversation with Master Nightingale in the classroom if you do talk with him about everything
That includes mentioning the Orb
In the Forge you have three puzzles to solve and they are all fairly easy You can do them in any sequence solving all three will yield the item you desire
Now that you have a Dragon for a companion
you can examine the one high up on the wall over the Magic Rune
Have Zak take a look
There are eight lights which I would number starting at the top
Numbers and are burning and and are not
The object is to light them all
Each lamp you click on will change its state and that of another
Easiest solution click on them in this order
lights and puts out lights and lights and puts out lights and
On the floor you see a cross composed of red and yellow branches
There is a pedestal at the center
Examine it to see nine circular switches
Clicking on them reveals runes similar to those on the Second Tapestry from the Library
Since we are in the Forge the logical word to focus on would be quot Fire quot The object of this puzzle is to illuminate the runes that spell that word
The object is NOT to illuminate all nine that would be too easy by pressing
Instead you must press in that order
Finally you mustlight all eight floor tiles
There are four controllers one in front of each forge
The one at the lower left shuffles the red ones around that's useless
The one at the upper left removes one red tile and lights two yellows
The one at the upper right takes away one yellow at a time and the one at the lower right adds red ones
If you overload a row the puzzle resets
Thus it makes sense to clear all the yellow ones first
Activate the upper right controller times
That turns off all the Yellows
Then use the upper left one three times
That lights all the Yellows and turns off all the Reds
Now use the lower right one lighting all the reds
With all three puzzles solved you get the lantern
Exit the Forge and Lydia will have a rather lengthy vision winding up at the Sanctuary again
You need to talk with Master Nightingale again and he is not here he is still in the classroom
Return through the Library and North tower taking the Red Teleporters to get to him
Talk to him until you get the password which will de activate the Protection Spell in the Secret Library
Okay back the way you just came Red teleporters to the North tower then yellow to the Statue room and into Nathaniel's office
Use the secret teleporter
Deactivate the spell and examine the bookshelf
You discover a blue book on the bottom and a choice of touching the red or purple books adjacent to it
You discover that the Red books move the Blue one up or down the Purple ones move the Blue book three spaces right and the Green ones move it three spaces left
Backing out of the puzzle resets it The object is to get the blue book moved up to the White one
Start with the Purple book at the right of the blue one
Follow that move with these Red R Green L Red L Purple R Red L Red R Green L Green L Red R Red L Purple R That places the Blue Book atop the White one whereas all the other books disappear and you have possession of the Spellbook
You can take it to the Master now if you wish but there is one more major puzzle to solve first
Go to the Solarium Herbology Classroom
and walk down the steps to the actual classroom
Listen to the conversation between Zak and Lydia then look at the pots under the gazebo
Examine the Fourth Library Tapestry to get some understanding about which plants are incompatible
You will see that Red and White and Red and Blue cannot be grown together and Green and White and Green and Violet cannot be grown together
Orange Pink and Yellow are neutral but Red and Green are mutually attracted
You must conclude that Red's and Green's enemies are therefore friends of each other
Confused yet
You want to grow White Blue and Violet
Now for the seasons
Some plants grow in only one season and some grow in two
Just like nature
What season is it in your arboretum
Want to solve it on your own
You will have to take notes and change the season four times experimenting to see what will grow and what will not
If it's Winter as I suggested you leave it you can grow White Red and Blue flowers
Make two of the pots White and Blue and leave the other one empty for now
Return to the Statue Tower and change the season to Summer
Return to the Arboretum and grow Violet flowers in the third pot and you are done
You receive the container with the Pearl inside
Now it's time to return the Spellbook to Grandmaster Nightingale who is still in the Classroom
They call it the Student Quarters Hallway sometimes
Go there and finally get the formula Zak needs
Go to the Lab via the stairway complex up Left steps Red teleporter and you are in the Lab
Talk to the Owl about everything
Clip one of the Dragon's toenails
Brew a potion to change Zak into a Wolf and collect some drool
Brew another potion changing Zak into a Cat
Collect some hair
Now you can brew a potion to change Zak into Human form
Go to the Sanctuary send Zak up the steps and have him solve the puzzle as suggested by the riddle
The Hints will take you through it if you don't get the riddle
Then you need to open the door by solving the puzzle on it
Before you open the Portal to the Sanctuary please insure that you have about twenty minutes set aside and that you won't have any interruptions
The closing cutscene is emotional and more effective if you don't have to deal with telephones kids or whatever
Here's the solution to the Portal Number them starting at the top

SPECIAL NOTE If you should feel you need to see photos of puzzles or puzzle solutions go to GIMLI and Jochen's KEEPSAKE walkthrough at http www gameboomers com Walkthroughs Kwalkthroughs html PART ONE THE DRAGONVALE ACADEMY Chapter On Finding Zak Nathaniel the academy's master leads you through the story's beginning in the opening scenes Then meet Mustavio in the lane near the academy He explains how to operate the conversation menu the fundamentals of game navigation and the multiple functions of the main menu map hints and inventory systems These menu functions are easy to use and are always accessible on the lower left side of the game screen
Lydia is left alone near Mustavio's merchant wagon down the river trail away from the academy Go forward along the trail to see the awesome academy for the first time Lydia walks up the broad entry staircase and attempts to gain entry There is no response to her knocking
Go back across the pathway to the central garden fountain where Lydia is supposed to meet Celeste Celeste is apparently a no show Go up the steps of the fountain structure and around to the back side Use the magnifying glass cursor and then the gear symbol to open THE MINOTAUR PUZZLE Objective To open the doors at the academy's main entrance Stand up the minotaurs and have them appropriately strike each of the four descending bells
Solution Use the purple question mark hint system in your menu to give you as much instruction as you may prefer

Use the blue button in the middle at the bottom to reset the puzzle
When you solve the puzzle the massive dragon embellished doors of the academy will open
There is no one there to greet you You may enter now but first its advisable to explore the forest area around the academy Leave the fountain pavilion vis the back stairs and go right screen along the trail Meet Mustavio at the end of the trail next to the fast flowing river
Mustavio quot the marvelous merchant quot is cheerful and friendly but is concerned that no one has come from the academy to buy his wares this day Mustavio is not allowed as he is a quot guest quot inside the academy unless he is accompanied by a staff member And since there are no staff members available or even the school's Caretaker Mustavio needs Lydia's help to find the Caretaker inside Mustavio needs the barrels of wine produced at Dragonvale and other items from inside the school He attempts to sell two figurines for a later puzzle to Lydia but she has no money and no present need for the figurines
Having concluded the conversation and having learned what you can from Mustavio attempt to go up closer to the river to get an overhead view and a visual hint at to what comes later Go back past Mustavio and left along the trail to the entrance of the academy Go on up the staircase to enter the grand atrium lobby and note the gargantuan central dragon statue a fountain that seems not to be operating Lydia can rouse no one
Nobody answers her calls
Reminder Use your map the rose colored cross button on your menu
Walk up to the engraved plaque beneath the dragon statue's head Lydia cannot read the strange writing but the location of the plaque is notable Back out and click on the statue to hear Lydia's comment
Go to the right twice around the dragon statue
To the right of the right side grand staircase you'll see a terrace with a stonework railing
This is the Machine Room Walkway Go there and hear a loud scratching sound
Lydia is understandably curious Go along to the right in front of the pillars and close to the stone railing In the next scene you'll see a set of stairs Go on up along the terrace and hear the scratching again
At the end is the Storeroom Inside you hear something or someone begging to be let out
Go forward until you see a row of wooden storage lockers There will be additional yelling from inside
Click on the locker below the blue button Meet Zak quot the mighty dragon quot Follow all the conversation options before touching the rune blue button
When you click on it you find the locker is still locked tight Oh darn Touch the button again in close up Whoa
Its Zak the wolf He's no dragon that's for sure Seems the students played a cruel joke on ol' Zak Start back out of the Storeroom toward the terrace Zak will say you need keys from the closet Finish the conversation required with Zak to find that he is astonished to hear that the academy may be empty of staff and students
Note You'll be interrupted periodically throughout the game by conversation between the characters When they've finished talking just proceed on your way
Turn around and walk back through the Storeroom to check out the three levels of the adjacent Machine Room There's a blocked door at the top of some stairs on the middle level but you can't get out and there's nothing more you can do here for now Go back to the Storeroom
One of the lockers here in the Storeroom holds the keys Zak mentioned Open the door to the left of the one standing open where you released Zak Take theKEY RINGhanging up to the left Click on the close up to put the key ring in your back pack inventory
Okay we're done here Off to the next phase of the adventure
Chapter The Enchanted Crossway and Finding Out What's In the Basement Leave the Storeroom by the terrace entry screen front Go back to the main lobby and go up to the top of the grand staircase on the right side all the way up where you see bookcases
Check your map to see that this is part of the Enchanted Crossway Go to the right at the top Go forward and then go down the stairs where you see more bookcases below you may have to back up one screen At the bottom go up the stairs you see to your left Keep going forward where you see sky ahead of you and a big bookcase to the right of a set of stairs You are in the middle of the Enchanted Crossway See that book on the floor there to the right in front of the bookcase You need that Pick up Mya's book Zak gets defensive about the ripped pages and theNOTEBOOKgoes to inventory joining thePENDANTand the key ring already stored there in your back pack inventory Though you can't read the strange language look at the book in close up Zak informs you that the language is made up of magical runes Cross the Enchanted Crossway footbridge to the Garden Watch a small balcony area overlooking the garden Look at the game table in the left nook Click on the game table to find that it holds a puzzle game called the Minotaur Maze During conversation with Zak you find you need the game pieces the figurines from Mustavio before you can beat the maze Zak explains the rules You can look at the game board in close up but you need the figurines to proceed
Go to the right Go forward toward the staircase ahead Don't take the stairs but go along the balcony below the stairs to screen left Continue down the next stairs to the flagstone path back screen Go around the corner on the path to your right Zak runs ahead exclaiming that he smells perfume Lydia follows Zak to findCELESTE'S DOLL a little jester
Lydia seemingly goes into a trance
When Lydia recovers from this trance she finds herself in the main lobby of the academy standing in front of a huge gated stairway Lydia realizes she's had some sort of vision and Zak tells her he's sure a mage will be able to rid her of the visions
They decide they'll have to bring up the academy's main power system before they'll be able to open the huge iron gates
The jester doll goes to your magnifying glass inventory
Now Zak and Lydia must find the basement in order that they might begin the task of reestablishing the school's power
Go to the right through the lobby and back up the right grand staircase At the top go right like you did earlier where you see the bookcases Go forward once and then down the stairs back screen Go screen front along and under the stair railing as before In the next screen take the stairs ahead and left Keep going forward across the footbridge to the Garden Watch Go right through the Garden Watch and down along the balcony in front of the upper stairs Return down the next stairs to the flagstone path again in the garden Go right around the corner down the flagstone path When you reach the end look right to see a door at the bottom of another set of steps Go to the door click on it and Lydia will automatically use her keys from the Storeroom to open it You'll find Mustavio's crates which are stored somewhere in this vast basement Go down the steps Zak is frightened of ghosts Go backscreen
Go down another set of steps Go left and into the little arched alcove back and left screen In the next screen look left behind the three big stacked crates to see a small box with a green label sitting on the floor under a chair You've found Mustavio's crates Click on them in close up
That's all you can do here for now
You'll be back to check out the crates
You'll need to find the hidden way out of the basement Come out of the alcove and go down the stairs Then go down the stairs in front of you Go forward and right under the first low archway Keep going forward In the next screen you can go left or right
Go right next to the brown wooden chest you see at screen right Then go the lighted area to find a breach in the basement wall where the wind is whistling in further frightening Zak
Click on the breach in the wall a second time
Lydia will drop her pendant and break it After more conversation with Zak you find yourself with aBROKEN PENDANT in the Academy's Waterway
Keep going forward and right to the top of the stairs Look left in close up to see some colorful flowers plants in a niche Continue down the stairs Where you see the turning water wheel go back screen to the door Use the gear symbol cursor to see Lydia remove tools that are blocking the door Remember you found a locked door beyond the Storeroom in the Machine Room beyond Now you can open the door and enter the Machine Room from the back side
Note Use your map and find the two small circles with a quot quot in the center The first is at the Academy's Waterway and the connecting quot quot is at the Machine Room
Useful information
After talking with Zak about the broken pendant turn around and go forward past the water wheel Go forward again and around to the right where you see two vertical alcoves in the stone wall with what appears to be hanging chains and weights Go there and click on THE WEIGHTS PUZZLE Objective To begin reestablishing power to the academy
You will need to set both weights at the level where you see the blue buttons the fourth position on the left and the fifth position on the right above the base line Above the chains and weights you'll see a circular wooden control plate on each side
These mechansims control the lift of the attached weights Note that the left assembly has four positions and the right assembly has six positions The levers to the left and right of the wooden plates control the positioning of the weights
Solution a Click on the wooden control plate on the right side of the puzzle
The weight rises to position b Click on the lever to the left of this control plate The right weight positions at the rd line
c On the left side of the puzzle click on the lever left of the wheel The left weight should descend to the bottom line
d On the right side click on the left lever This will lower the right weight to the bottom line And it will raise the weight on the left side to the rd line
e Back to the wooden plate on the right side
Click on it to lift the right weight up to the th line
f Finally and still on the right side click the lever left of the wooden wheel
This will raise the left weight to the th line and lower the right weight to the th line Click on the circular emblem in the center between the two blue buttons
You will see this area light up and a video appears of the wheel now turning in the Machine Room
Following conversation between Lydia and Zak about Lydia's background go around the corner and on the walkway to the now unlocked Machine Room door
Enter Proceed down the steps and walk over to the gray pedestal screen front
THE MACHINE ROOM PUZZLE Objective To complete requirements to power up five machines that supply the entire academy with power Use the Hint system for additional help
Look at the pedestal in close up
Note the outer circles carries three disks with Roman numerals quot I II and III quot You'll need to set each pedestal at the correct numeral in order to create a solid flow of energy from its origin which was established when you solved THE WEIGHTS PUZZLE
Looking at the grid on the pedestal you'll need to determine how to set each of eight pedestals first to last or vice versa
There are several solutions This is the last pedestal the furthest from the power origin as indicated by the double gear symbol to the bottom right on the pedestal grid You can see by the connecting line that to establish a line of power to where you are you must activate line quot III quot Solution Set this pedestal's handle at the quot III quot position on the outer edge
Just click on the quot III quot and the handle will position itself there
Now keeping in mind that there are three separate levels to the Machine Room you are in the middle walk over left past the next pedestal beside the stairs and go up the stairs to the pedestal on the landing in the middle of the staircase See that the setting here from the line where you began should again be quot III quot Set that handle
Go back down the stairs to the pedestal you just passed Again establish the numeral quot III quot as the setting which sets the power at the lower center node of the grid's middle level Go all the way up to the top of the stairs Go forward and right to the pedestal in the little fenced alcove Set the handle at quot II quot to establish the power line across the bottom of the grid's center rectangle
Come out of the close up and go all the way to the far right See two pedestals
Go to the far pedestal Set the handle at quot III quot to push the power line up to the second line of the center grid Go to the other pedestal here Place the handle at quot I quot to establish the power line traveling right on the grid
Go to the last pedestal on this level in the arched alcove to the right by the doorway
Set the handle at quot I quot to establish the last leg of power left to right in the center rectangle of the grid Go all the way down the three flights of stairs to the lowest part of the Machine Room

Read it Its an unfinished message outlining the Caretaker's orders to shut down the academy and to send Lydia back home when she arrives Leave the office to hear some strange sounds Go left and back down the left grand staircase to the front of the central dragon statue Look at the inscription on the monument at the base
Lydia can read it because she has secured the circlet It says quot Inspired by the magestic dragons the mages who built this academy created the school's ideals The great mage Nightingale claimed WISDOM to be the first ideal Winterowl declared the second ideal would be POWER Then they both agreed magic couldn't be used without BALANCE quot Chapter Introducing the Three Trials Leave the lobby and go back up the Whispering Stairway behind the dragon statue leading to the upper section of the academy Here at the entry you may have another discussion with Zak about casting a spell to return him to his natural state Go on up to the top of the first flight of stairs Go right and click on the magical door Lydia turns the key three times knocks on the floor and points at the door's large blue gem with her student staff The door collapses

Following the discussion between Zak Lydia and Mustavio about the broken pendant Mustavio agrees to give Lydia the two little figurines required for the Mintoaur Maze game This will happen only if Lydia will find his little barrels of wine along with some crates he needs that are inside the academy You just have to find them You already found the crates so it should be easy to find the wine barrels You must also find a way for Mustavio to cross the river with his wheelbarrow You can discontinue the conversation at this point if you wish
Go look at the river You can see where logically a double foot bridge would fit quite nicely There appears to be some sort of mechanism on a post on the other side of the river Let's accept that challenge to find Mustavio's wine barrels and establish a foot bridge so he can conveniently cross the river with his wheelbarrow
Go back along the trail to the main lobby of the academy Go up the right side of the grand staircase At the top go right and then click on or very near the chair sitting beside the bookcase at left In the next screen click to go down the stairs In the next scene go up the stairs on the left Cross the Enchanted Crossway and the footbridge to the Garden Watch where the Minotaur Maze game can be seen

During conversation with Lydia Zak tries out the blue teleporter disk and reluctantly Lydia acquiesces and follows
PART TWO THE UPPER ACADEMY Chapter Checking Out the Student Quarters Now at last you've gained access to the upper part of the academy Go down the stairs ahead of you Go up the stairs on the left ahead and then go along to the right side where you see a brown trunk against a stone wall When you get there go through the door and into Celeste's bedroom Go screen forward to hear that Celeste is not here and Zak relates that he knows Celeste was very ill Lydia argues with Zak about his lack of truthfulness and locks him in Celeste's room
Zak finally agrees to tell Lydia the truth At this point Lydia has another vision involving the strained relationship between Celeste and Nathaniel and Celeste's discovery of a portrait of her mother The real Zak is revealed giving a magical orb to Nathaniel who makes Zak forget everything Its obvious here that Zak has not always been entirely forthcoming but he had a legitimate struggle trying to remember much of what had happened at the academy
After the vision Lydia is out on a balcony with a red transporter disk at her feet From the red disk turn around and go back down the narrow left corridor Follow around to the left and then screen forward twice across that short bridge to enter the Laboratory You'll probably be surprised by Winterowl here
Enter the lab to find Zak Talk to him about everything Zak thinks a ghost may have let him out of Celeste's room Zak admits he's actually a human being who's been mistreated for a long time because of his appearance quot Dragons are beautiful quot says Zak He had thought he'd be respected if he were a dragon The notebook is Zak's and he tried the shapeshifting potion on himself The students didn't do it They had however locked him in the Storeroom where Lydia found him After discussing friendship Lydia and Zak resolve to be friends and to find out what has happened in the academy why the students and staff have vanished
Read the plaque on the lab wall down screen to the left of the center work table It reveals that Zak's bark substitute for the shapeshifting potion could not legitimately be used With an agreement to find more ingredients that will restore Zak to his natural human form lets go exploring Go out to the balcony just to the right of the wall plaque Use the yellow transporter disk to move up At the yellow node go forward and use the second yellow disk Using that next yellow disk to move up to the balcony with a red yellow and black disk You are in the West Tower
Important Note Click on the lower left cross shaped icon in your menu The map of the upper academy appears Use this map religiously to find your way around the upper levels I used several different graphic maps during this writing and found that the in game map is the most accurate simple and user friendly Even though I will continue to provide you with explicit step by step directions in this walkthrough make a real effort to familiarize yourself with the layout provided by the map It will pay off by saving you time and frustration
Use the black disk here You will be taken to the room which serves as a nexus for all the teleport disks in the academy You need to unlock all the disks for free access to the entire upper levels of the school The various colors control your access route As you can see the three yellow disks are active There are also three red and three blue disks Don't touch anything yet
THE TELEPORTER NEXUS PUZZLE Objective To provide power to all three of each disk color nine disks altogether Three yellows are already lighted There are four controllers around the periphery of the room Go to the upper left controller Its dull gray and sitting at about o'clock Click on the floating circle to shut it off The yellow disks in the center go dark You must do this first to clear all the circuitry
Solution
Click the upper left dull gray controller's floating circle again just once
Click the lower left controller's floating circle times
Click on the lower right controller's floating circle times also

Click on the upper right controller's floating disk two times
Congrats
You did it Step into the middle of the nine transporter disks You'll be taken up to the upper balcony with the blue red and yellow disks Click on the red disk to be whisked up to the West Tower's uppermost level and access to the Art Room Go forward along the little corridor and walk into that blue portal back screen
Cool When you and Zak appear on the other side go immediately right up the stairs and into the room at the top
You can check out all active areas of this interesting room and gain an idea of what will be possible later Check out Zak's invisible landscape on the easel at left
Then go across the room and click on the gray circular rune to the right of the window on the wall Zak is scared to death of course After the ensuing discussion click on the rune in close up Leave it activated
Leave the Art Room and follow the staircase down
Then go screen front down around the staircase winding around the Watchtower On the other side enter the blue portal Go left and then all the way up the stairs to the top of the tower where you see a red and yellow teleporter disk Use the yellow disk
After the discussion click the yellow disk again to be sent to the top of the East Tower where you see a central statue with multiple human figures apparently frozen in some sort of celebration On the opposite side notice a glass globe in an elaborate wooden stand No action available there now
Note the blue teleporter disk off to the right
Go back to the other side where the yellow disk is and then go screen left across the East Tower Skyway At the end you'll find Nathaniel's office Attempt to open the desk drawer behind the desk to the right of Nathaniel's chair
No dice Take the notes on top of the desk Lydia shows them to Zak They discuss the magic orb Zak forcibly gave up to Nathaniel TheMAGICAL PARCHMENTis sent to your magnifying glass inventory You can click on another floating ball at the corner of Nathaniel's desk but it appears it too is not yet active
Time to continue your journey to check out the entire upper facility Go back across the skyway to encounter Nathaniel's quot familiar quot Winterowl Reenter the tower at the other end of the bridge cross the statue area and click on the blue disk to access the upper Observatory classroom The planets and stars have an influence on the magic the mages and students practice Go to the rune on the wall beside the balcony at left Active the rune
Go screen front and around to the right
Climb the stairs At the top find the central pedestal overlooking the planetary atrium Click on it to see the various astrological displays Continue up a second set of stairs Note the sun symbol on the tile at the top You'll see a huge telescope for viewing the stars Go around to the eye piece of the telescope Zak will step on an adjacent tile with a moon symbol which immediately pitches the Observatory into darkness Take a good look at the Observatory puzzle at the telescope
Move it around if you like
You'll be back
Leave the Observatory turning the scene back to daylight as you cross the sun tile at the top of the stairs Go all the way around and down to use the blue teleporter disk again You'll be returned to the East Tower Go across screen forward and use the yellow disk to return to the North Tower Leave the disk area screen left go down the stairs and across the footbridge where Winterowl swoops down and steals Lydia's circlet and then mysteriously disappears through a wall
The duo automatically follows to arrive at the Sanctuary apart from the academy itself
Chapter A Visit With The Grandmaster's Ghost Go forward Zak finds the circlet where Winterowl dropped it and a ghost appears Wow
Zak was right
There is a ghost
This ghost needs help Click on him and complete all conversation choices The ghost is that of Grandmaster Nightingale no less one of the academy's founders Strong magic is being used at the academy because a chest with ancient artifacts has been discovered and opened The school could be destroyed Zak tells the Grandmaster of the removal of the orb from the chest at Nathaniel's command It was the only item taken Lydia and Zak must find the orb and Zak must return it to the chest
He is entitled to do this only because of his Nightingale ancestry
The Grandmaster tells them not to come in contact with the orb not touching it with bare hands They are instructed not to interfere if someone is using the orb unless lives are in danger After further detail about how to take the orb Lydia asks where Nathaniel is Grandmaster answers that this Sanctuary may be a good place to look Zak must somehow overcome the protection spell which can be accomplished only after he is able to assume his human form Grandmaster agrees to pursue the formula for restoring human form and exhorts Lydia and Zak to look for the missing orb
Only the academy principal can open the portal to the Sanctuary One exception Grandmaster does know of is that the teachers have an emergency way They have four items hidden in their classrooms They must be placed in alcoves quot up the magical stairs inside the small room quot The portal will appear for access to the Sanctuary We don't know where the four precious items are Grandmaster tells of the floating balls We must deactivate these magical floating locks by touching them and using the spell quot Dragonus Enferenis quot This action will allow a student to use spells and in other words activate puzzles so we can solve them
Use the blue portal to leave the Sanctuary and reappear on the West Tower Skyway Next we have to deactivate these floating ball protection locks so we can proceed with our important mission
Chapter quot Dragonus Enferenis quot aka A Puzzle Bonanza To get to the Watchtower we need to go around the balcony and back down the footbridge to the area with the red and yellow disks Go to the right of the yellow disk
If necessary wait again for completion of conversation between Lydia and Zak Then go to the floating ball screen right Click on it to hear Lydia deactivate the lock with the quot Dragonus Enferenis quot spell
Okay well done It time to solve the Watchtower puzzle in the center of this area Approach the center structure which bears a see through grid Click on it
THE WATCHTOWER GAME PUZZLE Objective The goal is to turn on all the lights in the grid
Each row vertical horizontal and diagonal may contain only one each of the four icons shown Its a game played by the mage watchmen while they stand guard in the tower There are several ways to solve the problem Use the Hint system if you need to

THE DRAGON LAIR GAME PUZZLE Objective Get the dragon to his cave by exchanging game pieces
The cave is in the lower left corner
Note and editorial comment I didn't spend a bunch of time on this one There are over moves to be completed in the correct sequence to solve this puzzle which is a silly waste of time in my opinion
Gimli and Jochen have provided a wonderful step by step graphic solution for this and other puzzles if you want to use it
You'll find it here http www gameboomers com Walkthroughs Kwalkthroughs html Or you can request the solution through the Hint system
Even the automatic solution requires almost four and a half minutes to complete the sequence
Once the puzzle is solved you'll be rewarded with a big red bunch of uglyALEUNDER'S ROOTS This ingredient will help create Zak's needed shapeshifting potion Go left and then forward to exit the Student Lounge Use the yellow disk to travel to the Main Tower When you arrive go up the stairs at screen left Go forward down the terrace steps and left Continue all the way down to where you come out into a courtyard Enter the Solarium Classroom through the sunlit arch to your right Notice the rune to the left just inside the arch Activate this rune also
Leave the Solarium Cross the courtyard screen front and enter the darkened arch across the way Go up the right staircase to the Atrium at the top go to the right again and climb that staircase At the top use the blue disk for a short ride to The Forge Enter Zak explains the purpose of The Forge classroom Go screen right to find the rune to activate for this classroom Its on the wall where you see a rust wine colored dragon mural The actual rune though is high above the mural displaying the symbol for Kyros fire
Examine in close up the puzzle above the mural after you activate the rune Hmmm looks like we'll need to find a way to get up there
We'll do that later Leave the forge area
Use the blue disk to return to the Atrium Go down the stairs At the bottom go back screen to the sunlit area you see between the two staircases This is the way to visit the Oracle Continue all the way down to the area of small floating islands Wow this is too cool
If you look closely to the left of the large stone you'll see the rune for the Oracle location Click on the stone and then one the rune at left
quot Dragonus Enferenis quot unlocks the floating ball and we can access the puzzle
THE FLOATING ISLANDS ORACLE PUZZLE Objective The goal is to reach the Oracle by journeying through a series of floating islands
Read the Hint system to learn how to read the lighted display on the dragon stones and how to determine whether to click to light or turn off the dragon emblem Follow the bridges as they appear
If you see that a dragon is already lit or isn't as shown in the solution just leave it and proceed to the next island
Solution for each island turn off dragon already should be off light dragon light dragon light dragon you'll see new coding on this one light dragon turn off dragon light dragon you'll see new coding on this one light dragon back at start ignore the old code shown and continuing to use the one from island above turn off dragon turn off dragon light dragon you'll see new coding on this one turn off dragon light dragon turn off dragon You'll eventually arrive at the wall of the dragon remains The Oracle wall Zak wishes to be a dragon again and suddenly a strangeORACLE MOSSis awarded to you for your inventory
Okay people Time to pop over to the Laboratory again to see what we can brew up for ol' Zak Follow the island path out where it appears without using the dragon stones This will take you back to the starting area beneath the stairs Return back up the staircase and along the corridor Go up the stairs on the left Use the red disk
Go along the little corridor left and around to the footbridge
Go screen front and on into the Laboratory
Once inside click on the round brown cauldron about of the way down the right side of the work table When you are provided with the conversation choices select the second one quot Brew a potion using Oracle moss Headen flower and Nigilis fruit quot HOORAY Zak is a dragon if a tiny one He doesn't seem to be all that excited though does he
Now that Zak is in the form of a dragon his ability to fly will likely be very helpful Meanwhile let's continue to explore starting with The Secret Library

From left to rightclick twiceon balls Note You can click through the conversation but I don't recommend it in order that you are able to fully enjoy the story's ending
The long sequence of visions reveals Nathaniel's selfishness and his ambition to attain exceptional power at all cost This while sacrificing his relationship with his daughter Celeste Nathaniel blames her for drifting away from him after her mother Elanna's death In truth Nathaniel abandoned Celeste
He continually treated her harshly when she tried over and over again to approach him during the time she most needed him As the visions are revealed Nathaniel realizes and deeply regrets the error of his ways With the last vision Celeste gives Lydia the pendant and Nathaniel promises to free the academy students and staff from the spell he's cast upon them Nathaniel witnesses Celeste's last moments along with Lydia as Celeste describes her enduring love for her father which always outshone all else Celeste is finally at peace In the ending scene Zak and Lydia discuss Nathaniel's departure from the academy and they both witness a lovely shooting star rocketing across the night sky This phenomena seemingly fulfills the legend of lost loved ones watching over friends and family after they have passed away
quot Could it be possible quot says Lydia in wonder quot Celeste's star quot Well we'd certainly like to think so wouldn't we

Each chapter will continue from the last chapter so everything you did and how you played with the choices you made will be included into the next chapter
Its not wise to just start the next chapter as the Game is narrative driven which means your progression from the previous chapter wont continue to the next chapter

When you die Old Graham will simply joke about it then the Game will load just before the decision is made
Sadly there are only four save slots in which you can copy one to save it in a different slot or delete it or rename it
You can in fact make three save slots for Bravery Compassion Wisdom and play on those saves where you can continue them through each of the Chapters
You can also backup your Save Files c Program Files x Steam steamapps common King rsquo s Quest Binaries Win KQSave Create a Folder wherever you like on your PC then put the save file there

THE END GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
KQ VGA Tierra Full Points List amp Supplementary Hints Len Green December lengreen hotmail com When I first played this game despite receiving some hints I finished with several points less than the full score Some players are very competitive about getting the highest point score possible hellip I am not However I DID want to experience the small portions of the game which I had obviously missed But I had no way of knowing what or where these episodes were This was a pity since there was so much humorous and interesting material which I had no means of experiencing
When afterwards the walkthrough by Chris Van Zyl was posted on th Dec I saw a way of discovering the locations of my missing points So I replayed the game inEXACTLY the same orderas his walkthrough and indeed achieved the full points There is an enormous number of different paths through which this game can be played I would not necessarily recommend anybody to followthisparticular course or for that matter to use any walkthrough at all This score sheet has been composed mainly for people who have already finished the game without or with walkthroughs hints etc
but lost some points and would like to catch up on actions he she missed
Thanks To Tierra for providing such areally magnificentversion of one of the classic Quest Adventure games Thanks also to Chris for viewing and permitting me to plagiarize his extensive walkthrough and even add extra descriptions and explanations hellip this list and extras really do supplement his excellent walkthrough
DISCLAIMERS A This list is based entirely upon the first version of the game There have been some small changes in version and there may be other small modifications in future versions This may of course affect the walkthrough and as a consequence this point count but I imagine that any alterations are very few and not of major consequence
B Some of the puzzles may possibly have alternative solutions lsquo codes rsquo directions etc
generated by different game playings hellip so it rsquo s wise to pay considerable attention and follow the hints generated inside each individual game
C Even by achieving the full score this doesn rsquo t mean you have done everything possible in the game There are very many actions dialogs etc which carry no points even though some are amusing interesting and add to the narrative
In addition to this there are apparently over Easter Eggs all of which contribute no points hellip they arenotincluded in this list
D A few actions candeducta point instead of adding one Only actions which increment the point score are included here So SAVE VERY FREQUENTLY both for this reason and sinceyou canoftendie Where this list indicates ldquo quickly rdquo perform the action s as rapidly as you can or you probablyWILLdie and have to return to your previous Save

THE END GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
King's Quest IV The Perils of Rosella Walkthrough After your speedy arrival in Tamir and Genesta's hasty departure you walk EAST
Keep your eyes peeled for a robin pulling a worm from the ground you could see it anytime when you do scare of the bird and quot GET THE WORM quot
If you miss your chance restore the game and be faster
Continue EAST for two screens past the river and thin trees to the more heavily wooded area
From here go SOUTH until you getto a lovely pool
Wait here a while and who should happen by
It's Cupid
You run to greet the little creature but he is frightenedand flies off forgetting to take his bow
So you go and quot GET THE BOW quot
From here walk SOUTH into a wooded area with a big rock
Continue South and you are by a lily covered pond with a little frog You would like to get your hands on the little guy but no luck
Go SOUTH another screen and you are again at the river this timeby a small bridge
But what's that
There's something shiny under this bridge
So you quot LOOK UNDER BRIDGE quot and lo and behold It's a golden ball
You haven't the foggiest idea what this ball is good for so you decide to go NORTH to the pond and ask froggie
He doesn't speak good English though
So you take a really wild guess I did and quot THROW BALL IN POND quot
Well what do you know
This frog is a retriever
He deposits the gold ball at the other side of the pond
You walk over to him and instead of retrieving the ball just yet first you quot PICK UP FROG quot
Remember that old fairy tale
You guessed it
quot KISS THE FROG quot and poof it's a snobby prince
Well at least he gave you his crown
Don't forget to quot GET THE BALL quot before you move on
You walk EAST into a graveyard you might want to read a few tombstones but it can wait until later when it gets dark hehe
It's a bit creepy here so you go SOUTH and find a funny looking house on the river
The door is open so you go in and have a look around this messy place
Who could stand to be in such a pig sty
Certainly not a princess
So you quot CLEAN UP quot and make things nice and tidy
Well no sooner than things are nice and neat the occupants return
You sit down for a hearty repast and engage in a little idle chit chat until the Dwarves return to work
They all file out and you quot CLEAN UP quot again but what's this
You quot LOOK AT TABLE quot and see a blue pouch
You quot GET POUCH quot and quot LOOK IN POUCH quot discovering a small fortune in diamonds
After a moment of reflection you decide that honesty is the best policy
You walk quot SOUTH quot and find a cave
Go inside and find the head dwarf at the back of the cave
quot GIVE THE POUCH quot to the dwarf or at least try
He's so impressed with your honesty that he lets you keep the bag and throws in a lantern to boot
If you haven't found the worm yet go EAST one screen to the dirt patch that has a couple of pine trees
The bird is found often around here
In any case from here go NORTH two screens until you get to the old house
quot OPEN THE DOOR quot you might want to take a look around but the important room for now is on your left as you enter
quot LOOK AT THE BOOKS quot
Do you like Shakespeare
Well it's all you can get
quot TAKE THE BOOK quot
quot LOOK AT THE PICTURE quot of the man which hangs on the wall
Hmmm better quot LOOK AT THE WALL quot
Aha
You found a latch
quot PULL THE LATCH quot and walk through the secret door
quot GET THE SHOVEL quot next to the doorway and forget about the stairs for now unless you're very curious
Save your game if you are those stairs are treacherous
Well now that you have this stuff what are you gonna do
Leave the house and go EAST and you're in another graveyard this one has a crypt but the door is locked
Go SOUTH one screen and there's a lovely waterfall
You try to get to it but the water pushes you back
You get out of the water and think quot Now what was that frog wearing quot The crown
quot WEAR CROWN quot and poof
You're a frog
Now you can swim under the fall and there's a cave on the other side
You take a look around and find a board at the entrance quot GET BOARD quot and go in
You take a fast look around because someone is coming you see a pile of bones and quot GET BONE quot and get out of there fast
Through the falls you go
Well what now
Go SOUTH one screen and there's a path leading EAST
You follow it one screen EAST and there's Lolotte's castle in the distance but two of her goons have spotted you
Well what the heck instead of running away you let them catch you and together you fly to the castle
This Lolotte is one tough broad
She tosses you in the slammer to cool your heels
After a while her guards come to get you and return you to the throne
It seems Lolotte has a job for you huh
Once you are returned to Tamir you proceed with the problem ofthe Unicorn
You may have seen him in the meadows but could not get close
Go back to the meadows and explore for theunicorn but when you find him keep your distance
What's that thing you got from Cupid
Of course these arrows are special they shoot love bolts
quot SHOOT AN ARROW AT THE UNICORN quot and it seems you've made a friend
You try to mount the beast but whoa you have no bridle
Make your way to the beach perhaps you will encounter a minstrel around here
If you do strike up a conversation with him and he'll play you a tune
But hey
This is no Andres Segovia that's spelled Eddie Van Halen to you youngsters you've got here
Maybe this guy should look for another line of work
Why not drop a hint
quot GIVE BOOK TO MAN quot
Well of course if you've got nospecial talents be an actor
And you get that lovely lute in return
Perhaps during your travels you encountered a little pixie named Pan but just couldn't get him to stand still
Next time you see him quot PLAY THE LUTE quot and he'll watch you perform
Your musical tastes run more towards woodwinds than strings so why not quot GIVE LUTE TO PAN quot
In return Pan gives you his flute
Now proceed to the fisherman's house
When you get to his house check the pier to the WEST
If he's there you can try talking to him but watch out when he gets up or you'll have to swim back to shore
Follow him into the house and look around
Bet you could find some use for that pole especially with that juicy worm you caught
But what do you have that he might want
A gift certificate from Van Cleefs
Oh no
Not those
Diamonds are a girl's best friend but after all these people are very needy and what good are these stones around here anyway
So you bite the bullet and quot GIVE POUCH TO MAN quot he oughta give you the tittle and deed to his house maybe even some stock in Sierra On Line but all you get is that lousy pole
WEST to the pier you go careful not to fall off the edge
quot BAIT POLE WITH WORM quot then quot FISH quot
There's a tug on the line smoked salmon perhaps
Nope just a stinky fish
Keep it you may get hungry
You decide to take a quot LOOK AT THE OCEAN quot but can see nothing at all
Time for some exploring
Save your game and jump in
Swim WEST until you reach the island Genesta's island
Have a look around go inside if you like but you can't get any help from Genesta she's out of it
You explore the island a little more and come upon a beautiful peacock which sheds a feather
quot GET THE FEATHER quot you're gonna need it
And walk back into the surf
BUT SAVE YOUR GAME HERE NOW
You are looking for a whale here but sometimes you get a shark instead
It would be a real pity to end up in JAWS D without a saved game here
Sometimes you get the shark sometimes you can make it back to shore
If you return to shore take a breather and go back in the water or restore to your last saved game and try some more
Eventually the whale appears stay where you are or swim to him
He'll swallow you
First thing you should do in the whale isSAVE GAME
Look around quot GET THE BOTTLE quot quot OPEN BOTTLE quot and quot READ NOTE quot It's just some advertising
Go to the right side of the whale's tongue about a half inch from the wall of it's mouth
From here you must climb diagonally up and to the left to a point on the whale's tongue about an inch from the top of the tongue and a half inch from the center where there a two taste buds that look like a point and a hyphen
Example When you get there Rosella will stand up Good place tosave game and you must continue moving diagonally to the top left just to the top of the tongue and to the immediate right of it's centerline
quot TICKLE WHALE WITH FEATHER quot if you're told quot not here quot maneuver a bit until you're in the middle
Once you're successful the whale will regurgi Ahem barf you up
There is a small island to your NORTH
Go there and get a little closer to the pelican but don't scare him off
He comes back so don't worry
quot THROW FISH TO PELICAN quot and he leaves you a whistle
But don't blow it just yet
First you have to find the bridle
Go to the boat wreck on the right stand in the middle of it done it a thousand times eh and quot LOOK AT GROUND quot
Miraculously Rosella stoops down and picks up the bridle
quot BLOW WHISTLE quot How's that for service
Hop into the water and go visit your new pal
quot RIDE DOLPHIN quot and you're off and back to shore
Go back to where you shot the unicorn he's still there
quot PUT BRIDLE ON UNICORN quot go to his left and quot RIDE UNICORN quot
Enjoy the ride as he carries you back to 'Lolotte's House of Leather' quot Pain anyone quot
And congrat ulate yourself on completing your first quest
quot Well some people are never satisfied quot You mutter to yourself as the goons carry you back to the forest
You begin your quest for the hen by heading for the ogre's house
It's the one with the yellow roof
Make sure the ogre or his wife don't see you though you may observe the wife bringing home dinner
The best way to get there is to go WEST two screens to the diamond mine and thengo one screen SOUTH
Have you got that bone from the waterfall cave
You're going to need it
Go into the house if nobody's outside the door isn't locked now
But horrors there's an angry bulldog charging you
Quickly quot THROW BONE TO DOG quot and go upstairs
quot LOOK AROUND quot and quot GET THE AXE quot you just saw don't worry about this closet it has nothing you need
Go back downstairs the ogre's wife is cooking dinner in the room to the right save your game now if you intend to take a look at her
But she's not important so you go to the closet across from the table and quot OPEN THE DOOR quot
Once inside quot LOOK AROUND quot
Yes that keyhole will come in handy
Eventually the ogre will come home when he does quot LOOK THROUGH KEYHOLE quot watch him until he falls asleep
SAVE YOUR GAME HERE and quot OPEN DOOR quot go to the table and quot GET HEN quot being careful not to get too close to the un jolly giant
Once you have the hen and are halfway to the door SAVE YOUR GAME getting out is tough since the hen always wakes up the ogre and there's nothing you can do about it
ALSO NOTE WELLthat this sequence is very hard to complete if your machine runs slower than Mhz and you have the version of KQIV designed for quot Turbo quot machines
There are versions of this game
One for fast machines and one for slower ones
Many people with slow machines and the quot fast quot version of KQIV have tremendous difficulty out running the ogre in this sequence but itcan be done
See your documentation for information on exchanging disks
Once you are by the door speed up the game by hitting the key many times it helps
quot OPEN THE DOOR quot the hen clucks and wakes the ogre
Run out of the house and down and around the woodpile one screen EAST be careful not to get close to the trees
The ogre won't chase you around the house but you've got to get past the trees
And you have just the thing trees hate quot SWING THE AXE quot and all the quot dead quot trees will fear you from now on
REMINDER
SAVE GAME HERE
From the back of the ogre's house go NORTH one screen to the pine trees and dirt and then EAST two screens to Lolotte's
Her quot biker quot pals come down to give you a ride
Hooray
You finished quest number two
We'll she tells you to get Pandora's Box but doesn't offer any clues
Gee thanks
So you're back at the path to her castle
Why not explore some uncharted areas
Now that you are safe from the quot Venus Fly quot trees you can check out the area to the NORTH
Go NORTH to the waterfall you stop to ponder the hidden grotto but decide to wait a bit and proceed NORTH one screen to thegraveyard and NORTH again another screen
Well now you can get through here those trees don't scare you anymore
Go NORTH again and you are in front of a skull like cave
Go in but don't get too close to the witches SAVE GAMENOW
One of them will come towards you let her
Pay close attention to the two in the back
Watch how they pass the eye back and forth
That's the key you can grab the eye at the moment they are exchanging it
If you can avoid the one chasing you
Try to quot GET THE EYE quot at the proper moment and if you do they are helpless
Leave the witches for now
They eye is a powerful bargaining chip even though it's of no use to you
Let them sit in the quot dark quot for a while and think it over
Maybe they have something you could use
Go back into their cave and they plead for their eye
They throw you a scarab
quot LOOK AT SCARAB quot quot GET SCARAB quot
They plead again for the eye
quot THROW EYE TO WITCHES quot and you get some points but don't go any closer
You've gotten all you need from them
Go back to the waterfall and turn yourself into a frog
When you reach the entrance to the cave quot LIGHT LANTERN quot andSAVE GAME
If you don't have Pan's flute don't bother with this now go and make those trades then come back
If you have the flute proceed EAST into the cave
Beware of the troll it is possible to lose him in the cavern but difficult
Usually he gets you and you need to restore until you get a a chance where he doesn't come out
It's sort of like trying to get swallowed by the whale and avoiding the shark
From the entrance go SOUTH as many screens as possible until you get to the SOUTHERNMOST part of the cave
From here go EAST until you get to a screen where you see a light in the distance
SAVE YOUR GAME
There is a chasm ahead chances are you will fall in a few times and it was tough getting here in the first place right
Move EAST very slowly you will see the chasmin the glow of your lantern
quot PUT BOARD ACROSS CHASM quot if told to quot move closer quot do so carefully until you can put the board down
Once the board is down get close to the SOUTHERN walls and move slowly to the EAST across it
Once you make itSAVE GAME
Just in case you fall in
Go NORTH another screen and proceed EAST out of the cave
Move EAST to the edge of the water SAVE GAMEAGAIN
There is a small point of land with a longer jetty just under it directly across from the nearest tuft of grass in the swamp
Move to this point on the shoreline and quot JUMP quot
If you are told to quot just move quot you are not on the right spot
Keep trying to find the right spot
When you are on it Rosella will jump onto the tuft
Repeat the quot JUMP quot command until you reach the last tuft of grass and are right in front of the island with the magic tree
quot PUT DOWN BOARD quot and a cobra springs awake
quot PLAY THE FLUTE quot and the snake is charmed
But not for long so be quick and cross the board quot GET FRUIT quot stay clear of the snake and cross back
quot GET BOARD quot and repeat the jump process until you are back on shore
Night has fallen and there's lot's to do if you're going to get this apple to your father in time so go back through the cave SAVE GAME
And find the right spot to quot PUT BOARD OVER CHASM quot and cross over
Go WEST all the way and then NORTH all the way until you are out of the cave
Back through the waterfall and into the night air
Move NORTH one screen and you are in the graveyard with the crypt
All sorts of things are popping up around here but with that scarab they can't touch you
Go WEST to the haunted old house and quot OPEN DOOR quot
Once inside you hear a baby crying upstairs so up you go to the bedroom on the left and move WEST into the babies room
The crib rocks but there's nothing in the room this kid wants
So down the stairs you go and out of the house
Walk WEST to the graveyard
Good thing you have that shovel
You quot READ THE TOMBSTONE quot s while the zombies harass you until you find one on the right side all the way in the back where a six month old baby is buried
quot DIG quot and you find a rattle
Go back to the house put the rattle in the crib and the crying stops
But chains start rattling downstairs
Down the stairs you go and search until you see a ghost
quot LOOK AT THE GHOST quot why it's an old 'miser'
Back to the WEST graveyard you go
Reading the tombstones until you find one that mentions a 'miser' on the right towards the front
You quot DIG quot and find a bag of gold coins
You then return to the house find the ghost and quot GIVE COINS TO GHOST quot and it vanishes
Next you hear crying from upstairs
Go to the bedroom on the left and a woman appears in a rocking chair
You quot LOOK AT GHOST quot and find that she is a lonely ghost
Heartbroken perhaps
Off to the WEST graveyard you go
Read the tombstones at the front to the right of the big tree
You find one that belongs to a woman who lost her love at sea
quot DIG quot here and you recover a locket which you return to the lady ghost
You hear more wailing downstairs and find another ghost wandering about below
You quot LOOK AT THE GHOST quot and see he is the distinguished quot Lord quot of the house
The tombstone next to the lady ghost's belongs to a quot Lord quot a war hero as a matter of fact
Back to the WEST graveyard you go and locate the tombstone that belongs to the man who quot served his country well quot
quot DIG quot and youfind a Medal of Honor which you gladly return to the quot Lord of the house quot
A boy ghost appears and you follow him upstairs to the bedroom on the right
quot CLIMB quot the ladder to the attic and observe him
quot CLIMB quot back down the ladder and go to the graveyard on the EAST side of the house
His grave is the one on the left in the back
The only one that belongs to a boy his name is Willy
You quot DIG quot and recover a toy horse which you return by climbing back up the ladder
Once he has the toy the boy ghost vanishes and you can quot OPEN CHEST quot and quot LOOK IN CHEST quot
You find a piece of sheet music and take it with you
quot CLIMB quot down the ladder and go downstairs to the secret room in the library
Walk up the stairs SAVE GAME
YOU MAY FALL
and go to the organ get in front of the bench and quot SIT quot quot PLAY THE SHEET MUSIC quot
When you are done a secret drawer opens up quot LOOK IN DRAWER quot and quot GET THE KEY quot
SAVE YOUR GAME and go back downstairs
Leave the house and go EAST to the crypt
quot UNLOCK THE DOOR quot and enter the crypt
quot LOOK AROUND quot kind of Egyptian isn't it
quot GET THE ROPE quot and you discover it's a ladder
quot CLIMB DOWN quot and don't worry about the mummy SAVE YOUR GAMEbefore you go quot GET PANDORA'S BOX quot which sits on the floor
This way you can open it and see the ghosts they'll kill you but it's worth a look if you enjoyed RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK
quot CLIMB ROPE quot and head back to Lolotte's
The goons will pick you up when you get to the mountain

King's QuestVII The Princeless BrideWalkthrough bySteven L Zook This document contains the following sections Introduction Chapter quot Where in blazes am I quot Chapter quot A troll is as troll does quot Chapter quot The sky is falling quot Chapter quot Will the real troll king please stand up quot Chapter quot Nightmare in Etheria quot Chapter quot Ready set BOOM quot Introduction This walkthru is a very shortened way to complete the game
It takes many shortcuts and is not actually intended to be used as is
Primarily it is intended to document the key actions necessary to complete the game
There are many other paths through the game and in a normal game much searching around and talking to characters would be necessary to learn enough to choose the actions taken
If you follow this walkthru you will finish the game but will miss most of the cleverness charm and wit of the game designers
The walkthru also contains many sequences that do not need to be followed in order
Most chapters have several tasks which must be completed but do not have to be completed in the order presented
I played the version of the game for this walkthru
At press time I have heard rumors of a version which fixes the bugs and crashes that occur in this version
Chapter quot Where in blazes am I quot This chapter has at least three very different paths based on the wether or not the Desert Spirit is helped and wether the 'Hunting Horn' is retrieved before helping him
In this version the absolute minimum step path is shown where he is not helped
This version skips some of the tricker sequences like turning salt water to fresh Take 'Ripped Petticoat' from cactus Walk screens south
Take 'Hunting Horn' from skeleton Walk screens north Enter cave north
Take 'Basket' Examine 'Basket' and open lid Rotate 'Basket' to see 'Corn Kernel' inside and pick up 'Corn Kernel'
Pick up all four 'Clay Jar's in any order first will break
Leave cave Use 'Corn Kernel' on sand under dripping water Examine gourd plant just left of corn stalk Examine picture on rock wall right of cave entrance Take 'Gourd Seed' from now open gourd plant Walk screen east Use small door under quot Rare Curiosities quot and talk to Kangaroo Rat
Use 'Hunting Horn' on Valanice to blow out dust Use 'Hunting Horn' on eastern Jackalope hole twice to stun Jackalope
Take 'Jackalope Fur' from cactus Take 'Glasses' from ground Use small door under quot Rare Curiosities quot Use 'Glasses' on Kangaroo Rat Use 'Gourd Seed' on Kangaroo Rat and trade for 'Turquoise Bead'
Walk screens west and screen south Take 'Stick' Take 'Salt Crystals' from south edge of pool Use statue's head this rotates it and causes sun rays to come out
Examine statue's collar and line all blue beads to third column
Use wrist band on statue's right hand this drains the pool
Enter empty pool Examine offering tray Examine empty part of tray Use 'Turquoise Bead' on offering tray Examine offering tray Take 'Turquoise Piece' on right Leave pool Walk east screens Use 'Ripped Petticoat' on 'Stick' to make 'Flag'
and put it ininventory Enter doorway Use 'Flag' on scorpion quickly or Valanice will expire Examine statue Use center symbol on side Take blue bead at bottom on one hand of statue Place yellow bead at right on other hand Place red bead at left on pedestal right and behind statue Note last two steps are not always necessary due to bug in some versions
Take 'Turquoise Piece' Leave building Walk screens west and north Use 'Stick' on cactus right of doorway and take 'Prickly Pear' Use one 'Turquoise Piece' on the other to make 'Puzzle' Examine lock above doorway twice Use 'Puzzle' on lock Enter open doorway Inventory 'Golden Comb' 'Clay Pot' 'Stick' 'Basket' 'Hunting Horn' 'Jackalope Fur' 'Prickly Pear' 'Salt Crystals'
Other paths The Wanderer will give an item either a rope or bug reducing powder if he receives fresh water
Fresh water is made by picking an 'Ear of Corn' from the corn stalk
Then go to the salt water pool and fill the 'Clay Pot' with salt water from the pool
Prime the statue head and collar as usual
Using the 'Golden Comb' on Valanice cry into the statue's bowl pour the salt water into the bowl and put the 'Ear of Corn' into the statue's left hand
The water should be transformed to fresh
Then use the 'Clay Pot' to give the fresh water to the wanderer
Instead of getting the 'Hunting Horn' the 'Glasses' can be had by getting a 'Rope' from the Wanderer
Then the rope is used to trip the Jackalope by tying it to two cactuses and tripping him
Instead of using the 'Flag' to trick the scorpion the scorpion can be rendered harmless by using bug reducing powder from the wanderer
Chapter quot A troll is as a troll does quot This chapter is a fairly long one
A lot of time is spent walking back and forth through the underground
The items necessary to make the magic potion do not have to be collected in any particular order

Chapter quot The sky is falling quot This chapter is somewhat tricky as Valanice must walk back to the desert to complete it
Also without foreknowledge it is easy to have finished chapter without enough objects to solve a couple of puzzles in chapter

To get into the game console type shift ctrl all at the same time
You won't be able to control the game again until you hit shift ctrl to go back
Once you are in the console you'll see a prompt asking for your password
Guess what there's no password that's just there for fun
Type in all codes in lower case letters
I have tried some of these codes and they work pretty well noConCollide clipping mode walk thru walls etc conCollide turns off clipping mode setFirstPersonsetThirdPersonexistlistActivehandsOffshow teleport type this and your map clears completely
Click on the current world's map and Connor will be teleported to that spot
Click somewhere high on the side of a mountain though and Connor could fall to his death
This only works in the land you are in all others go away
debug crasshes game LookupBump makes Connor move a little bit forward and through walls Give allows you to give Connor stuff that he hasn't gotten yet provided you know the programmer's name of the object
Some of them are pretty weird because they were made early in the design
For example to give Connor more money you would type give silvercoins which would then give him gold pieces they originally were going to be silver
Other things you can give Connor are heath items mushroom sacredwater crystal elixeroflife magic items clarity invisible invulnerable strength and rocks rock
You can also give him armor leathergloves chainmailsuit weapons flamesword icecrossbow and inventory items mold ashes goodskull
There are too many items to post here but I'm sure someone will figure them all out
Rocks don't seem to work
MaskconsoleRunalias god of course there has to be a god command it makes Connor practically invincible
He can still die from the River of Death and from falling great distances mainly because it would have been a pain to program so don't be too confident
However monster's can't hurt you

Which has globes hanging on it
Some shelves contain all of the items that you have seen through the game
Three switches rotate the shelves and when you take an item from the shelf it is replenished when you rotate the shelves
Using these items you must re create potions from the spell book and put them into the correct globes
You can easily tell if you have the right potion in the right globe by clicking an empty flask on each globe after you have filled it
If it is the wrong potion you will be able to empty the contents of the globe into the flask if it is the right potion you can not
When you have filled the first globes correctly

Go back down and east to the inverse towers of anoi
This consists of tubes side by side each sitting on top of a face
Inside the tubes are disks of different sizes and colours the smallest is yellow then light blue blue grey and brown for convenience I numbered them to
The object of the exercise is to place all the disks in order into first the left hand tube and then the middle
To move the disks first click on the one you want to move the eyes of the face beneath it will open
Then click on the tube you want to move it to
It is not easy as it sounds and there is probably a logical sequence to do it
I found the best strategy was to shuffle the tubes around until only was visible in the rd tube and the first tube was empty
From there it is only a matter of shuffling the plates around until is visible and move it to tube
When you have done this you will have your stick and the missing gear wheel
Return to the gear room and put the gear onto the empty spindle and fix it in place with the stick
The hand now appears
Attack the hand then dodge it by jumping on top of the gears at the middle left and then onto the furthest away
Attack the hand again
Marko now comes to your aid
That's all folks now sit back and watch the credits
