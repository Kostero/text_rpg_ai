Enter the Adventure Shop and take a look at everything
Note in particular the mail drop box
Open the curtain and find an indignant woman
At that same moment an adventurer arrives in the shop
Talk to the adventurer
Note Sometimes the topic to choose from these conversation lists is obvious but not always
If you are unsure make a mental note of the available threads and just work your way through all of them
Eventually something good will happen
For the adventurer keep asking him to prove things
Accept his offer of abottle of rum Return to your ship and give the bottle of rum to them
Before you leave find the white vertical plank of the ship
It is directly in front of you and covers your secret stash
Click it to get therotten plankand shillings
Walk to the right and look at the boat that is leaking but not sinking
Now you need to find the secret agent and get him on board
Walk left and talk to the man in the Mexican garb
He is Montgomery the secret agent that you are looking for
In this long conversation you learn about Dr T the problems at the tea plantations and the reasons why you were selected for the mission
You also learn quite a bit about your own background
Montgomery gives a secretparcelto you for mailing but first you will have to find a stamp
Move left to talk to Amanda
She is an American and she is headed for to Tooth Island
She gives herinvitationto you
Obviously this is the henchman Dr T is hiring
Look at the invitation in inventory and see that it has a stamp
Go toward the shop and talk to Captain Cookster
He is a former ship captain and he is asking for donations to help him obtain a new ship
The only start you can give him is the rotten plank so give it to him
In return he gives hispipeto you
Just for fun go into the shop and have a chat with the owner
Then try to drop the parcel in the mailbox
Talk to the owner about stamps but don rsquo t buy anything yet
Go back outside to the front of the shop and move to the crates at the right
Climb the crates twice to get to the ledge
Walk all the way to the left and then drop down onto the crates at the side of the shop
While you are on the top crate look at the blue bowl in the niche
You can rsquo t take it with all those wasps
Use the pipe on the wasps to smoke them out and then take thecereal bowl
Bonus Climb down to the ground and take the three tea canisters
Use all three canisters with the three other cans on the ground to form a pyramid
Climb back up to the ledge go to the far right and climb back down twice to the ground in front of the shop
Go left return to your ship and continue right to the rowboat
Dip the cereal bowl into the rowboat to get acereal bowl of water
In inventory combine the cereal bowl of water and Amanda's letter to get astamp
Now combine the stamp with the parcel to get aparcel with a stamp
Go back to the store and place the stamped parcel in the mailbox that is to the right of the counter
You have now satisfied Montgomery rsquo s request
Leave the store and walk to the right where you see Lawrence and Eric your crew members
When you talk to them you find that they don rsquo t want to set sail because they haven rsquo t been paid and the ship is poorly equipped
Go back to the store and talk to the owner
He has four items on sale for shillings each but you can buy only three of the items because you have shillings
Your decision is not crucial so buy any three items you want
In this walkthrough I bought thescissors thelighter and thelubricating oil
Leave the shop and head right to the two crew members
Tell them about the items you just bought at the shop
They are not highly impressed but they agree to set sail
Go back and tell Montgomery that you have mailed his parcel
Now he is ready to go
Use the anchor icon on your ship to cast off
Watch the ship rsquo s progress to Tooth Island off the coast of India
Chapter Shipwrecked Thanks to Montgomery the ship has run aground and is wrecked
Amanda and the crew row to the island without you
Montgomery dissuades you from the obvious solution taking the stairs and ends up destroying the Temple and blocking the stairs
He turns the task of making your way around the cliff to you
Look left to see a wooden plank in the water
It might be useful if only you could reach it
Walk up close to Montgomery and take thestarfish
Bonus There are five starfish in all to pick up in order to unlock the bonus feature
Pick up the elephantpiggy bankbehind Montgomery
In the course of talking to Montgomery he gives youtwineand a shortfuse
The cave entrance is between you and Montgomery

Take thestarfish down screen from the contraband
Go left to the dense vegetation that is covering the exit
Use the knife on the dense vegetation
Go out to the rock ledge and see your destroyed ship
Take thestarfish right in front of you
Then come down to the left end of the ledge and take thestarfish
Climb up onto the stairs and then go up to the top of the stairs
At the far right of the screen is a ldquo jump rdquo icon but you decide the distance is too great
Look at the loose boulder and at the crevice behind the boulder
Combine the elephant piggy bank with the gunpowder from the musket
Then combine the elephant piggy bank with gunpowder with the short fuse
Place the elephant piggy bank with fuse into the crevice
Use the lighter to set off the explosive
Note If you bought the old compass instead of the lighter you can use the knife on the old compass to get a lens
Then use the lens on the elephant piggy bank with gunpowder in the crevice
Thanks Marita
Go back up the steps and out to the end of the fallen boulder
Now you can jump across the precipice and Montgomery joins you
Look at the fallen column to wonder whether it might be helpful in going up higher
Come down and cross the wood walkway
Look at the ship rsquo s rigging and use the knife on it
That appears to have made matters worse
Go back across the precipice down the steps and onto the rock ledge
Go to the back of the ledge and walk across the fallen ship rsquo s mast
Take the fancyfishing rod yourduffle bag bonus object and the giantwoodwormfrom the plank
Walk back across the mast and straight ahead into the cave
Continue through the cave back to your starting point

Combine the fishing rod and twine and then combine the complete fishing rod with the woodworm to get afishing rod with worm
Use the fishing rod with worm on the wooden plank floating in the water to get thewooden plank
Go back through the cave up the steps and across the precipice
Use the wooden plank with the column to create a seesaw
Climb up the boulder behind you and jump on the seesaw after asking Montgomery to stand on the other end
Good idea but Montgomery is too heavy to rise high enough
Talk Montgomery into doing the jumping and you succeed in reaching the higher ledge
Pick up thewedgefrom the ground in front of you
Take theprayer wheelfrom in front of the blue statue head
The head rolls down but it rsquo s not enough to elevate Montgomery
Look at and use the old chest
It is tilted forward and it is heavy
If you could make it fall below it might be enough to launch Montgomery
Go left and up the stairs

Thanks Marita
Try the winch again and climb down the rope
Take a thirdpiece of stone head
Note the tightly closed oysters on the ship
Go back to the old chest above Montgomery
Talk Montgomery into taking his clothes off to make himself lighter
Then place the three pieces of stone heads into the old chest
At that moment a young woman arrives
The falling chest works in shooting Montgomery to your ledge and the young woman delivers one of the funniest lines of the game
Walk over to the right and look at the green vine hanging down
Talk to Shari and learn about her wedding being ruined by the collapse of the temple
She will help you by tossing the vine over if you bring her tiara to her
Go up the steps and move to the big brown door
Use the hook to open the door enter and pick up thehot Indian spicethat is near the edge
Walk left and pick up thebroochfrom the ground
Look at the brooch to see that the impact must have jostled the gemstones loose
You can predict that Shari will not accept the brooch without gemstones
Continue left and look at the flagpole on the cliff wall
Exit back through the temple entrance
Go to that wooden platform left of the temple entrance and head down the rope
Spread some of the hot Indian spice on the oysters under the ship and take thepearlthat pops loose
Combine the pearl with the brooch to get abrooch with gemstones
Go back up the rope head to the right and down the steps
Give the repaired brooch to Shari who then rips off the vine and throws it down to you
That is not what you had in mind but pick up thevine Talk to Montgomery who reminds you that his clothes are still down there
Climb back up the steps and go through the temple entrance
Go to the far left and wrap the vine on the flagpole

Look at the brightly polished star mounted on the reception counter and see that it is glued tight
Note the fireplace to the right of the reception desk
Use the bell on the reception counter and talk to the manager about everything
Montgomery has a room here but the manager won rsquo t give you access
The manager is obviously proud of his one star and keeps it clean and buffed
Ask the manager for aglass of water
Recall that it is the fireplace that gives the Inn the one star so dump the glass of water into the fireplace
While the manager is busy go to the pushcart
Take the cleaning agent on the upper shelf and the turpentine on lower shelf
Now place the cleaning agent on lower shelf and the turpentine on the upper shelf
Smear the shiny star with the burnt stick of incense
The manager hurries to clean the star but he is inadvertently using turpentine

Look at the floor at the foot of the bed and take thered sock
Leave the hotel and return to the guards
Show the Montgomery agent ID to either of the guards
You have to answer questions to be sure that you are British
For the first question recall your experience atop Big Ben
The answer is ldquo crows rdquo For the second question the ldquo miraculous rdquo answer will do
In fact you can use any answer and you will eventually be allowed through as long as you keep talking to the guards
Go around the barrier and move forward past the elephant
Look at the caged plant beside the guardhouse
Move forward up into the village and at the intersection take the road to the right
Go to Pop rsquo s and meet Mr Gopesh
He is thinly disguised mafia and Shari's father
Talk to him thoroughly
You cannot enter the Mr Gopesh rsquo s store but you can go through the arch that is decorated for the wedding

It announces a poetry reading at the butcher rsquo s Try going up the stairs but you are stopped
By the woman at the first table
Talk to this woman

Go up screen and back to the checkpoint
Meet Pandu the ldquo taxi rdquo driver
It seems that after a night of carousing he rammed his elephant into the guard house and broke his back tail light
He doesn rsquo t remember any of this and he can rsquo t afford to pay the pounds to the guards
He will take you to the airfield but the guards must be persuaded to let you pass the barrier
Talk to the guards about letting the elephant go through
Give pounds to either guard
You still have the matter of fixing the back light
Go back up into the market place and talk to Louise who is standing next to a purple umbrella Focus on the elephant handler who Louise believes seduced her granddaughter Shari on Friday night and therefore could not have rammed the elephant
Encourage Louise to tell the guards
She does but she gets little satisfaction
Back at the stall talk about the wedding the party and Shari rsquo s favorite jam Ask for and get somejam

Now you can talk to Pandu about the airfield again and off you go on an elephant ride
A side scene shows the two thugs talking to Captain Cookster at Cape Town
They are certainly being persistent in tracking you down
You and Pandu arrive at the spot where the gorilla set up the road block
The elephant can go no farther
Walk left as far as you can and then go up the steep green slope
Note Become familiar with this crossroads area There are four ways to go
One is back down the slope the way you came

Place the nut inside the head rsquo s open mouth
Continue left and find a branch with a hole
Put the piece of wood in the hole
Climb up move left a little and climb again and enter the treetop
You see a hut with a monkey pedaling to create electricity probably for the electrified fence
If you want to get past that fence you need to stop this monkey
Continue up toward the hut and look around
Use the screwdriver on the grating and then take thegrating
Use the prod with the bell next to the door and watch the monkey come out to check
That will be useful to know
Retrace your steps jumping down twice around the head to the stone arm and into and out of the head
Descend the stone steps and walk out to the end of the ledge where you found that big nut
Look down and drop the grating into the gorge to trap the anaconda in its den

Go to end of the open area of the loading dock and take another look at the hanging board
It appears to say the following

Unload the cargo

Use a lever to switch off the lights

Wave pom poms to signal the airship to take off
Look at the two unconscious chimps
Take thetwo pom pomsand thetwo punch cardsthat are held by the chimps
Take theduct tapeand thebox of balloonsnear the chimp on top of the crates
Look at the lever on the floor and see that it is the broken lever for switching off the lights
Another way must be found to accomplish step
Step is to unload the cargo container
However this is dangerous because the cargo is a crate of nitroglycerine
You need to find a way to unload it safely
Look at the box of balloons to see that there is a balloon in there but the box is sealed tight
If you haven rsquo t done so already use the lever under the instructions board at the right to release the platform

Pull the lever again and the box of balloons is broken open
Take aballoon
Go to the wall at the opposite far end of the area behind the cargo container

Use the balloon on the helium leak
Now you have a soft landing for the nitro
Return to the crate of nitroglycerine that is held by chains
Look at the two yellow blocks that connect the chains to the crate
They each have narrow slots
Insert the two punch cards into the slots and the chains are released
The crate slides out of the container and comes to rest against the balloon
Step completed
Step is to switch off the lights but the lever for doing that is broken off
You must use brute force by firing the rifle at all five overhead lights in the area two on the elevator side and three on the other side
Step completed
The final step is to signal the airship pilot that he can leave
Stand on the red square with an X
Combine the two pom poms and then use them
The airship lifts away and now the ladder into the shaft is available
Go down into the shaft

Walkthrough for Normal Mode written by Mr Bill Game Originally Developed and Published by Topware InteractiveRevised and Updated by ZUXXEZ Entertainmentand Published by JoWooD Productions Introduction The Story This game is a new version of one of our old favorite detective yarns Jack Orlando but now all spruced up and upgraded so you can fully appreciate it on the newer computers Jack is an irascible and irreverent has been private eye once competent and respected but recently no better than any other common drunk And now as perhaps the final chapter in his miserable life he has been framed for a murder that he didn't commit and has only hours to prove his innocence
The story is a classic as is the setting the period immediately following the repeal of Prohibition in America The city is reminiscent of the Chicago underworld of that era and both the characters and the dialogues are right on target It is during the middle of the Depression years and you are moving through the seedy and desperate world of the gangsters and common thugs the whores and the derelicts where anger and loss of control are always just under the surface and life is cheap And they don't mince their words when they talk to each other the attitude is combative and the words are the language of the gutter
Please Note TheManualis on the CD Hit theF Keyto access Jack's Inventory Right Clickto access the other Action Icons such as the Fist for hit Magnifier for look or Gun for hit or shoot
About This Walkthrough We would advise you to not use this walkthrough until you are totally stuck but heed the warning below first There are a number of places to visit people to talk to and items to pick up but we will limit them to only what is necessary to get you successfully through the game Those conversations that provide vital information in the game can in a few cases only provide this information if a particular order in the discussion is followed and that sequence will be given in parentheses Just remember that an adventurer should generally pick up anything and everything that is not nailed down and in this game you will also need take a couple of things that are either nailed or bolted down As a result you will pick up a lot of red herrings useless inventory items Jack's coat will be loaded with them but that's OK Also remember that adventurers should talk to everyone until they have exhausted all possibilities in the conversations
A Word of Warning Jack can die in Normal Mode so not only save often but also save often under different names Due to the many changes that were made this new version of Jack Orlando contains a potential dead end that traps nearly everyone Therefore it is very important to save often under different names so that you can go back to an earlier save if necessary It is especially important to save just before meeting with a man by the name of August Bellinger and do not save over it so that you can go back to that save if you find yourself at the dead end

For Questions or Comments on this Walkthrough Please write to MaGtRo Copyright MaGtRo GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
A few comments were made that maybe just maybe a little guide of strategies would be helpful for this game So I thought why not share some hard won secrets with those of you who wish to torture yourselves
This is NOT a walkthrough Hopefully this will be a guide to help you get past some difficult situations Some comments here are excerpts from e mails and posts Quotes are in A special thanks to Shirley and Cheryl for playing the game with me letting me steal their quotes and adding strategies that I missed Points to keep in mind while playing Always try to sneak past your enemy When they turn away from you you can follow by walking Watch your enemy to observe the path that they walk This is their motion area Walking up behind them and whacking them on the head before reaching the end of their motion area can kill most Some enemy cannot be killed without taking some damage to yourself I usually leave these guys alone You know them because they shoot you before they even turn around
If unable to sneak by your enemies you could also try to run like crazy to avoid bashing and bullet fire
There are a very few parts where it is good to run after you have stood and scoped out the enemy and decide that may be the way to get around them Use your A D and S keys to change your point of view If you don't you'll be complaining throughout the game about the lousy view angles
Using these keys separately or together will give you lots of various good camera views You can also use your arrow keys with the S key as well Well you'll probably complain anyway they can be awful
If you stand still and are standing outside an enemy s motion area and he is walking running towards you he'll more than likely just turn around and walk away when he reaches the end of his motion area So be quiet do not panic Corners are usually safe places to sneak to Boxes are also good Enemy will usually ignore you when you are on a box or higher up
This is a glitchy game I ran it with DirectX and every so often it would dump me to desktop This usually occurred when I was loading up a saved game after having played for a while I was never dumped while in the middle of playing and only happened about times Others were able to play with DirectX but had to load different drivers Another player could not continue the game using DirectX and a Voodoo graphics card The graphics were just too bad See below for more detail on this issue
Camera angles are sometimes askew When this happens use your S key You can become stuck in walls fall beneath a lake a conveyor belt and the like It's a fact in this game and you'll get used to it If you get a really bad camera angle then you probably aren't supposed to be where you are Reload or extricate yourself
This game works best with default keyboard controls They are similar to other games of this genre such as Tomb Raider The game manual says that a game pad can be configured but that the default keyboard controls work the best Again see below for more detail
This is a linear game it follows one path Your exit will be somewhere in the near vicinity Most of the puzzles in this game are actually figuring out where the exit is
Saves and health These were my main concerns with this game I wanted more health and more saves I finally realized that the makers gave you enough health for each mission area I would save up to healths with Jekyll just to lose them when I became Hyde It's not worth it Figure out the level and get out As for saves well save whenever you see the pocket watch icon You can walk back and forth between some levels and kill baddies and return right away to another level to save That baddie will be no more Example You enter an area There is a bad guy in front of you You sneak up and kill him Go back to the previous level Turn around and reenter your current level You will get the pocket watch Save your game That bad guy is gone forever
When jumping Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde use the S key to check that your sight is lined up for a good jump trajectory
Having your line of sight perpendicular and in the middle to where you want to jump is helpful This is very important in the caves at the end of the game It will often look as though you are going to jump down or up to a ledge just to find that you missed and are now dead
I think I finally learned how to get Hyde to jump better tonight
I now line him up to where he is going to go and then as he is moving I WATCH HIS FEET and hit my jump key just before the edge Works much better for me I WAS before watching where he was going to jump to and my timing was way off a lot of the times
They left a lot out in the manual of how to get Jekyll to do his fancy moves I think
I didn't know either that while he was hanging there he could move right or left
Quite often your way is hightlighted for you Look around for very bright objects or objects that seem to have a beam of light on them You can usually interact with these or it is the direction you should take In the Caves Corridor level the green lights in the library room are overly bright as a hint and some of the ledges in other rooms are lit up to hint the direction to take Street lights will also signal a possible exit or interaction in the quay dock areas
I found that the game played better and crashed less if I disabled my virus program and shut down unnecessary programs while I was playing
The game style and atmosphere are the best part of the game The well developed characters add to this feeling When you play Dr Jekyll you are a reserved gentleman When you play Mr Hyde well read this HUZZAH
I'm Mr Hyde and I'm one mean ol' snarling not to be messed with S O B
bwahahahahaha Trouble is when I lost my good looks and great ahem personality I seem to have also lost a few brain cells too I'm running around snarling growling slobbering and ready to go
I also find it strange that he Hyde can jump better and it seems further from a standstill walk jump combo than from a run jump combo
It defies gravity
Hyde will need to throw rocks boxes and barrels at different times during the game When you are Hyde if you pick up anything to throw there is an infinite number of things to throw at the time You throw your item and magically there is another one to replace it if you just wait long enough
At the beginning of most levels there will be a cutscene Watch closely as there are clues shown as to which way you should go or things to accomplish in the level Some of the cutscenes actually show you the way to exit that level
Take a peek at Jekyll's diary in the options menu once in a while There are clues to what Dr Jekyll believes he needs to accomplish to find his daughter and it's just plain interesting
There are no cheats for this game at this time If I ever find some I'll try to update this guide Here are some hints for confusing areas Desk in Lab Lecture Hall blocking the way to the kitchen area I got the desk moved only by accident
I had been pushing shoving jumping up and down even tried beating it so badly that I thought I was going to make some pulp for paper out of it
Then I tried crawling under it on the right high side so that I could lift it
Beating it from over there worked
I myself got on top of it and used the action key It took a few tries but it will work
You just need to move Hyde around and find the spot that triggers it
Towers At the start of the towers level you must use the crank from your inventory to lower the cages hanging from the ceiling It appears that nothing is happening but if you turn Jekyll around and look you'll see that the cages are actually lowering I believe that if you turn up your volume you might be able to hear them as well
Opium Den You get around the opium den by sneaking up and killing your enemy one by one You must be Mr Hyde to make the jump to the dragon's head and yes it does work Make sure that you are lined up properly and take a running jump The First Quay after Cut Scene Go up the concrete ramp in front of you and turn left Run or sneak past the sniper and guards to the alley doors leading to the rail yards It's really more of an alley than doors so it just looks like a dark area
And a neat thing about this area is that you can go into the next level save your game return to the docks and kill off some of the guards one by one and go into the next area and save your game after each one
You'll come back here later so if some of them are dead it'll be easier on you at least the two or three by the exit there
The same holds true for the next level rail yards
You can kill some of them and return to the dock quay then return to the rail yard and save your game
It's like being able to save when you want
The Print Machine in Warehouse To get through the printer's I used the printer itself to get by those nasty robots
You will have to climb up walk a little ways watch the timing of the robots climb down go a little further and climb back up
You need to get to the other side
Don t miss an important clue here Be sure to look up in this area Barge after rail yard and conveyor You can use boxes to hide and kill thug or just run and jump onto barge
Once there pull up onto top of barge
There is a brick wall archway in front of you
Walk Hyde off the left side of barge you can see a box on floor of barge
Use box to pull up onto top of barge on other side of wall archway Don't jump down to the front of the boat where there is a guard with a gun walking around
You aren't meant to be there Instead run and jump to barge steerage roof and keep running and jump up and through the window
The game saves automatically here and your fight with Yang starts
Mr Yang To kill Mr Yang you must run up when he is unprotected whack him and run away when he becomes Blue Bubble Boy BBB courtesy of Sassy
He will not hurt you if you are the right distance away
If you are too close he will bump you with bubble if too far he will shoot you
Just the right distance and he will do nothing and stop bubbling and then you can attack
It takes about whacks to get him
The Railyards Walk up the spiral steps to the control tower Even though you are being shot at they shouldn't hit you as long as you keep walking An alternative route to tower is to jump from the tall boxes to the left of it
If you get in the corner behind the boxes there is a movable big crate that you can push forward along side the tall boxes and use it to get to the top of boxes
Then you will need to do a run jump to the upper level of the tower Conveyor I just ran down the length of the conveyor and jumped to the walk in front of me I then walked around the glass and whacked the guard as he slept
Green Isle and Tracks If you opt to use the island platforms you will get to one that has a tall spire on it This spire is here to make it hard to jump to the next island platform You must use a running jump from the right side of the platform just missing the spire to make this jump It is not easy and will take a few tries
I ended up taking the route down the tracks because I just couldn't make the second set of Green Isle jumps
And that was a hard route too Robot Warehouse with Claw Machine You can either walk underneath the machine and make a jump when you are almost at the end or try running zigzag past the claws I found walking then making a jump much easier When the robot's back is turned walk calmly just left of center under the machine When you are close to the back set of claws jump between the railings into the next area and run past the robot
Electric Chair Book Room Some folks have had problems getting Jekyll to sit in the chair I walked up the right side steps and then approached the chair from the side not the front Hit the action key and Jekyll should stand in front of the chair and then sit
There seems to be a known major glitch here in the game for some folks and if you can't get him to sit you might have to reload a previous save or uninstall and reinstall the game Of course move your saved games to another folder if you do that Manipulate the robot to pick up the book using the symbol on your upper right screen as a guide and return to the robot's starting point before the blue air runs out
Cemetery Step by Step This will get you to Stevenson's tomb
I don't know if it is the shortest but it's pretty fast
You won't be stopping to pick up anything other than the key and the doll
An intersection can be or way You will miss a lot if you use these directions You may want to play and look around for a while before using them
From the start of the cemeteries Get the key from the shack just to your right at the start of level You will be running the entire way Start runningRight at st intersectionForward at ndLeft at rd and run through the gateNext areaForward at st intersectionLeft at ndForward at rdForward at thRight at thRun through archway past vamp in purpleNext areaLeft at st intersectionRun all the way to next gate and throughNext areaPick up Laura's doll at intersectionGo back to gate and turn around to face the cemeteryRight at st intersectionLeft at ndRight at rdForward at thRight around corner by purple vamp You can only go right Run through gateStephenson s tomb is the one on the left Remember have your key ready walk behind the vamp usethe action key and jump into crypt
If you take the time to go through the cemetary take note of the names on the tombs If you check these names against the credits at the end of the game you'll notice that they are the same
Caves and Corridors There are maps of the corridors scattered around the hallways The corridors are color coordinated so take note Some hallways lead up and down and there is health scattered about as well Your purpose in this leve is to destroy columns in different rooms I had to go back and destroy a column I had already destroyed to be able to end the level If you have trouble finishing this level you might need to recheck to see that all your columns are still ruined To destroy the columns use the rocks on one of the beams at the very top of the room and toss them at the center column In the Library there are two steps You must whack the green lights to bring down the major part of the column and then assend to the top of the room and destroy the rest of the column
End Scene and Boss Level Fight When I played this game I had no boss to fight and the game ended abruptly After speaking to other players I realized that I had played some actions out of sequence and thus forced a different ending Following are two different scenarios as related in e mails
NO Boss I climbed up as Hyde and killed one vamp and the other walked off the beam
I then walked around and broke all the beams with rocks till they were vertical about each
I had to climb down and then up again to get more rocks to appear and the vamp that had fallen off had to be killed as she was at the bottom walking around
After I had beams standing vertical and the green miasma beam with the cage was semi broken I descended again and went and got the Book When I reenter the Dorm for the final battle as Jekyll there must be nothing for the Boss Vamp to stand on so he falls into the pit I calmly walk up the beams and collect my daughter
Now I know why our endings were different It's the book When you said you had the book I thought you had it before you went up the beams not after I grabbed the book befor going up the beams
Boss Fight When the level starts and the Howlers start at ya
I found it easier to go counter clockwise to the green lite ramp first and stand there and wait then start my way around then clockwise
This way you can grab the boulder on your way to the next ramp as you head to it it also made it easier for me to remember that I started throwing rocks at the first ramp from the greenlite one
Just throw one rock at each ramp as you go around and repeat that times
You may have to wait for the rocks to fall from the ceiling as you finish your last toss going around once I'm not surebut it seemed to me that the rocks would not fall again from ceiling until you finshed tossing rocks on a once around trip
You are safe on the beams
I would have Hyde stand there at the end of a beam facing the way to walk clockwise then use my s key to watch the Vamps route and just walk off to grab rock as they just passed me and walk to the next ramp and leisurly line up my throw and toss and then wait and walk agian
Have full health to start with Jekyll has a medikit in his coat you can use you shouldn't loose any health til you start tossing the rd rock onto each ramp and they start toppling then it get just a little harder
A Few More Points about the Game Funny Glitches and Easter Eggs At the beginning of the cemetery level enter the shack on your right to get the key If you look left you'll see a barrel Whack the barrel a couple of times and you'll get a puppet Jekyll holding a sign that says something like I love heart Mahara
had one of the craziest things happen to me
I was in the Cemetery at one of the gates and I hit the 'yes I wish to continue' key and when the level loaded there was Jekyll and this was like in the blink of an eye standing there with his head spinning round in circles like something out of the Exorcist
I thought I was hallucinating But I know I saw it I had a funny thing happen too the other day
I was on a box and tried to jump down real close to a guard and was gonna whack him real quick after the jump well instead of landing close to him I landed on top of the dude
It was funny
I just stood on top of his head and whacking him from up there did nothing so I just started spinning Jekyll around like a top on top of this guys head and then started jumping up and down on top of him
What a hoot
Then I fell off and of course he shot me
Just like the glitch with the moving sidewalks I was able to walk all around under the lake
Really weird
Had a real rough time jumping up on that last railway car Hyde kept falling down between the cars and you could see him running there like he was pushing the train
I get a little weird flashing in the Lecture hall every now and then but nothing major and if I get Jekyll stuck to close to something and he can't move the screen jiggles but I don't think its a glitch just something the game does At first I thought that was snow coming through the ceiling in the Lecture hall but looked up at the lights today and dust is probably a good description Nancy
Looks real cool
I also like when you stop Jekyll from running and you get the little poof of smoke or dust or whatever coming out from behind his heels
Sound is real good too
It was weird yesterday like I was picking up some sort of someone else's radio signal or something strange
But today sounds great
I'm using headphones
Like Hyde's snorting and snarling
Not so Funny Glitches I have a question about the display settings
I want to set it at but every time I go in there it resets to
Any way of keeping thehigher resolution
Since I only have a measly meg card on this PC Ican only do bit graphics
My graphics are really glitchy
While I was hunting down water to put out the fire I jumped up on the counters on the kitchen
I was able to jump right up into the cupboards and the stove vents
Also my camera gets spasmodic on me occasionally
Looks really weird
And I keep getting hit by invisible lunatics
The game keeps crashing to the desktop and resets a lot of my settingswhen it does
After replaying several spots countless times so that I could save my medikit potion for when I felt I really would need it I find that it is not in my inventory now Neither is the ether
Never even got to use it
This never happened to me but it is something to keep an eye open for
Likes moving the saves from the J amp H file is easy They have a folder called SAVES and it looks like it has every thing there you need all at once
Has good confirmation when you save a load so you don't do something you shouldn't accidentally do I did full install and just accidentally found out you don't have to have the CD in to play the game I like the camera views you can get when you hit the s key
Have you noticed that the camera views can be changed with your arrow keys besides the a and d keys My walking stick has one hell of a long reach for bashing folks
And most of them go down pretty easily with just one whack Getting used to moving the Dr around and jumps and strafing while holding on to edges are getting easier
He's actually not a bad jumper compared to a few other games I've played The voice acting is good so far I like the rain effects Use of lights and lighting is great Saves take up hardly any room at all so moving them before you write over them takes up very little HD space Like the inventory system Hot spots are fairly large and items to find are pretty easy to find so far Graphics are cool not outstanding but pretty darn good Atmosphere is good Keys are easy to learn
Gripes Only save slotsThe save often suggestion in the manual is a joke
I will only let you save where it wants to anyways most of the time No backwards for Jekyll the down arrow only turns him around
When I'm being attacked it sure would be nice to back up so I don't get clobbered
No keys for strafing either can only seem to move forwards which makes lining up for jumps take longer The down arrow that turns Jekyll around doesn't do it in precise or degrees turns No quick saveCan't rebind the shift key to get him to run I keep getting very dizzy from the way the camera keeps swaying all the time when you move
When Jekyll stops moving the camera keeps moving slowly till it stops in the direction he's facing Sometimes I lose track of where he is when he goes behind a wall and I end up getting whacked or something cuz I can't see him You seem to lose a whole lot of health too quickly when some one hits you or you fall not very far
Have to exit game to rebind your keys No Alt Tab so you can check WT or this guide while playing the game
You must exit the game to get to other programs A Word about Direct X This game works best with Direct X or a Below are some problems encountered when trying to use X
Up until this point it was bearable but here there is no way the game can be played DX was known to have some problems with games that came out before it was available
Plus with a v card DX is just not compatible
Dreamcatcher lists this game as incompatible with winXP which is surprising as this game is not all that old
I tired every compatibility mode and it kept locking up
I'm using DX a I'm also using the official drivers for it I switched to this driver when Atlantis was giving me so many fits
Before that I think I was using the WHQL drivers which worked for all the games I played except A I'm having no problems when I save and graphics look and act good
I set my res to x when I first started and when I was looking in there today it was back to x Seems like you may have to set your RES every time you start up the game
Phlooey
I have a voodoo card but I don't know what drivers they are
I know they are pretty old but have worked great for games where others have had problems with latest drivers so I am very reluctant to change
Since the company that made the voodoo card went out of business the V and DX are not the best together
On my XP machine I have DX a
but no matter what compatibility mode I tried I could not get Jekyll to work
A Word about Gamepads I did notice in the manual that it says a digital gamepad won't work right with the game
You need to use an analog one
I wasn't sure what kind I had so I'm just using the keyboard
I am having a problem with programming my gamepad
I am pretty sure I did it right but when I go into the game I can't use it
The goal here is to be able to use both the gamepad and keyboard at the same time
The gamepad when programmed is a keyboard emulator thus you can use it in games that don't even have gamepad support
I unplugged my gamepad
It is both an analog and digital as it was soannoying to uncheck this especially as I have to restart the game aftereach save opportunity and I will save whenever it allows
You have to exit the game to reconfigure the controls
Also in that area if you have a gamepad on your machine every time you launch the game you have to go into controller options and deselect use joystick for movement
I had no problem with rebinding my keys in fact I found it easier for me to use my own settings
Just wish I could have rebound ALL of them End Game Walkthrough http www gameboomers com wtcheats pcJj Jekyll Hyde End html Last note There are probably many more questions but as long as you keep in mind that the purpose of this game is to just keep moving forward toward the end and finding your daughter Laura then you'll always know where to go The caves are the exception it's just one big puzzle It is also the end of the game no more moving forward Good luck

Jekyll amp Hyde Walkthrough By Julia Tiemann amp Nancy Griffin E Mail Juliathecard aol com And if I am not around E Mail Nan grif worldnet att net First I want to wish you all quot Good Luck quot playing this game
It is a challenge and I will have to say I quit on it the first time when I reached the tower
I just didn t know what to do
I went to the cheats but they were very vague on what to do
A week or two later I thought I would give it a try again
Just by chance I walked Dr Jekyll off the side of the walkway near the cage and he caught himself and used his hands to get by that cage
After Jekyll fell to his death I could not as much as I tried to repeat that feat
Finally I decided I would try making him jump
I thought it would not work because the cage looked so faraway
But he made it
I played that scene hundreds of times before I got to the half way spot where you get an automatic safe
Then I played the last half of the tower many times before I made it to the top
Boy was I relieved
A bit later I got stuck again
I e mailed an old friend quot Norma quot from the quot GAMES quot board and she sent me Nancy s e mail address
She pushed me in the right direction and helped me get past the table on the second trip to the tower
I thought that must be the hardest part of the game
Wow was I ever wrong
I am hoping that this walkthrough will be a help to all gamers so they can succeed in helping Jekyll reach his goal of saving his daughter
No puzzles to solve just jumping and climbing and trying to figure which way to go and where the next health bottle will await you
As I said before it is a fun game and a very long one
There are a lot of glitches in the game
If anyone has been to Nancy Griffin s strategy walkthrough she mentions the problems she ran into
Some of them are side splitting you just can t help but laugh
And laughing is good for us all
My computer would freeze up on me quite often and always at the wrong time wouldn t you know
One thing I did at the very beginning after I loaded the game I m famous for reading the instructions after the fact quot You have to go the configurations to set up your keyboard to move Jekyll and Hyde around
I use the keys they suggested and it seems to work fine for me
I will have to say when I played the game the second time I did much better
There are three keys that are important
The first is the quot S quot key for lining up your jumps so the object you are jumping to fits in the middle of the screen
You can move both Jekyll and Hyde a tiny bit if you are careful pushing the arrow keys
The quot Q quot and the quot D quot key are for camera angles
There are places in the game where you can t use them
So don t be alarmed when you see a red quot X quot on them
The cameras are a big help when you have to turn a corner in or out of a building you can see what is there so you can be prepared
Now comes the big confession
When you get towards the end of the game an dare in the tunnels I have yet to do that part by myself
I have been all through the tunnels but haven t rescued quot cute little brave little Laurie quot Nancy Griffin has written the walkthrough for that part of the game and she has allowed me to include it with this walkthrough
As of this writing I am still trying to beat the quot Boss quot by myself even if I do use her cheats
With Nancy s permission you will find her complete walkthrough of the tunnels attached to this walkthrough
Be sure to check Nancy s strategy guide
Once again let me say have fun with quot Jekyll and Hyde quot regardless of the problems with the game it is well worth playing
Best Wishes to you all Julia P S Thanks Nancy for your support and thank you to your friends for the save games that help me to complete the game
Also thank you for allowing me to include your walkthrough of the tunnels to this walkthrough Thanks again Nancy
The story starts out with a movie clip OFFICE amp LAB Dr
Jekyll is in his office lab on the desk is a bottle of health pick it up and place in your inventory Then go up into his lab and get the bottle of ether
When you go back to the office Edna will burst in saying that Spencer has kidnapped Laurie
And Jekyll tells her to go inform the authorities that he is going to find Spencer
Leave your office and turn to the left and walk around the door use your camera at corners to look for escaped inmates
There will be an inmate as you turn the corner
Use your left control key to swing Jekyll s arm with his cane to kill inmates
Go down the hall to the last door on the right
This is the auditorium you will see Spencer on a table and three inmates running around
You have to get rid of the inmates so you can talk to Spencer
He will explain what has happened and give you a key
Turn to your left and use the key to open the door and walk down the hall you will find more inmates on the loose so use your cameras at the corners
Go to the first door on you left this is the kitchen area watch for the inmate in the kitchen do him in and then head for the cafeteria
In the cafeteria there is a food cart
You need to push this so you can stay protected from the inmate throwing plates at you
When you get close to him run at him and whack him with your walking stick
My new friend Nancy said she got past this goon by hugging the wall on the right side to avoid the plates
I never thought of that
There is also a female inmate farther down watch out for her her hits are deadly
And they say women are the weaker sex
Ha DORMITORYAfter you do away with the two goons you can enter the dormitory turn to the left and go in the room there on the floor you will find a crank
Pick up the crank and put it in your inventory for later use
Leave this room and go the opposite way turn the corner and walk down to the mattress
Use you quot S quot viewing key to see an inmate standing on the wall ready to throw plates at you
I used the ether to send him to Night Night land
Once he is out of the way you can go to the room just in back of where you are
There is a bed and a mattress leaning on the wall
Climb up on the bed and jump to the mattress and climb up on the wall
Walk straight ahead and then make a left turn farther down there is another plate throwing inmate you can sneak up on her and do her in
Jump down holding on so you don t lose any health and pick up the health bottle there
TOWERYou can now enter the Tower
Good luck here there is a lot to watch out for
Two inmates on the ground and some will reach out of their cells near the floor and whack you so beware
Do away with the inmates or run by them to the opposite side
Climb the walkway to the second level beware when you get to the top do some jumping so the hand near the floor won t hit you
Use the crank that you found earlier to lower the cages
If you turn quickly you can see them come down
You will need to jump to some of them
There are four places to use the crank
If you fail to make it to the top after using the crank in all the four places you won t have to use it again
Good Luck this is a difficult part of the game
While climbing up in the Tower watch for handrails over the cells and by large areas that you need to get past
Both Jekyll amp Hyde can use their hands to get past these areas
When you get to the top Burnwell will be there and he threatens to cut the rope holding Laurie but instead cuts the rope to another prisoner
He makes a demand to see Mr Hyde
When the conversation is over you will be at the bottom of the tower
You must find your way back to Dr Jekyll s office lab
When you get there go to the bookcase near his bed and stand to the right of it and use the quot enter quot key to make him push the bookcase to find his secret laboratory
He will prepare a drink a mixture that will transform him into Mr Hyde
AUDITORIUM ND TIMEWhen you get to the auditorium you will find a table blocking the door
Walk to the right side of it and give it the good ole one two three and Hyde will knock it out of the way
Nancy and I and two of her friends all got stuck in this spot
Nancy said she jump on the table and tried whacking at it
What you need to do is stand on the right side of it and whack it a good crack and Hyde will push it out of the way
When you get in the hallway there will be smoke so watch carefully for goons
KITCHEN ND TIMEWhen you get to the kitchen area there will be fires burning don t get to close to these as they can do damage to Hyde
Jump up on the counter and then jump down walk forward and you will see the first inmate towards the left sitting down on the job
Let him have it before he sees you
There are three more inmates to kill two males and one tough female
When you get to the door to the dormitory it is on fire
There is a door that is located near the kitchen that has a barrel of water in it
A word of warning don t get the water till you rid yourself of the dangerous inmates and also Hyde cannot hit or run while carrying an object
You need to get the barrel of water and carry it to the exit door be sure to use your quot S quot key to line Hyde up to make a direct hit with the barrel of water
DORMITORY ND TIMEAgain you will have to climb to the top of the walls in the dormitory
There are two inmates throwing plates up there so you will have to move fast so they don t do too much damage
One of them you can avoid but the other you need to dispose of
Make your way the same as before
When you get near the door to the tower there will be another tough female inmate down there so drop down at one of the side rooms so you can use your cameras to watch her movements when she is walking away from you sneak up behind her and finish her off
The best and easiest way to dispose of inmates is to attack from behind them if you walk they can t hear you but if you run they will
STREETSThe scene starts out with Dr Jekyll walking down the street in the rain
Use your camera to see around the corner
There is a bad guy coming and you need to dispose of him
After you get that messy business done with walk down the street to the building with a huge guard
Push your enter key and Jekyll will start talking with the guard
Charles DeWitt will come along and help you get into the Chinese Brothel
BROTHELYou and Charles will walk into the building and he will introduce you to Mrs Wong
When the clip is done head for the staircase to the left of where you are standing
Go up one floor and walk until you find the prostitute
Talk to her and she will tell you she wants her papers that are kept in a safe
If you get these for her she will help you
When the clip is done go back down the stairs and walk over to the desk by Mrs Wong
If you stand next to the desk and wait until the guard comes walking past her before you try to talk to her you will be able to kill them both without alarming the other guards
After you take care of them walk behind the desk and get the key on the counter
You cannot get the key unless you do away with them
After you get the key walk across the room from the desk there is a door there that you can open and the safe is in this room
If you are very quiet you can open the safe with the key take the papers and leave without disturbing this guard
If you can t get the papers out of the safe it is because you are still holding the key Take the papers back to the prostitute on the first floor
She will tell you about James Wang
Now go back over to the other staircase and go to the rd floor
Watch out for the guards sneak up behind him and let him have it
The door you need to go through is the first one there will be a man and a lady in the room Move quietly and whack them both
Then walk over to the basin with water in it and change to Mr Hyde
After the change you need to go back down the stairs and go up to the rd floor on the side where the prostitute was
Watch out again for the guard do him in and walk to the end and you will see a partially broken railing
Give the railing a hit and it will fall apart
Walk back a few steps turn and use the quot S quot key to line up your jump
Jump at the dragon and pull yourself up
Then aim for his mouth and jump forward and pull yourself up into the dragon s mouth
This has been a hard spot for a lot of people playing this game
Good Luck if you are this far you are doing great
I jumped at the dragon on the landing between the first and second floors
This is the wrong one
After you walk through the dragon s mouth you end up in the warehouse
WAREHOUSEAfter you walk through the dragon s mouth you will enter the warehouse
You will have to jump the beams to get to the opposite end
The first two jumps are broad jumps
The next jump you will have to run and forward jump
Use your quot S quot key to line this jump up it is one of the harder jumps
When you get to the back corner you will see a building that you can drop down onto the roof
Then drop down to the floor and go into the building
You will see a lever to push on the console that will move the building across the room
Before you drop down look around with your quot S quot key
The other cameras are disabled for this part of the game
You will notice there are two guards walking around
There is also a robot that is walking around and he goes through a big double door
The double doors are way to your left when you look out the side of the traveling car
You must make your way to this door
After you have looked around go to the opening and drop so that you land on the crates with the red amp white
These are health crates and if you need some health this is a place to get it
If you don t need any health these boxes will be empty
Run and try to avoid the guards and also try to time it so you can get right through the doors when they are open
Or you can try to make you way back there by hiding by the crates
Once you get through the doors go through the next door right away
When you pass through this door you will change back to Jekyll
PRINTERS ROOMThis is the printer s room
Jump up on the printing press right away
Don t forget to save your game
Watch out for the steam vents as they will rob you of your health
Walk as far as you can then stand on an angle and watch robots when they are walking away from you made a couple of big jumps and climb back up on the press
Move on back farther and do the same thing again
When you get to the back of the first press walk across to the other press
Use your quot S quot key
It is very smoky so you will have to jump down and run and then jump up
You should see a press that moves up and down
Jump up on that press and then jump on bar that is by your head
Look up and you should see an opening
Jump up into the opening and pull yourself up into the room
Use the water to change back to Hyde
Nancy said there is also some health by the water
Once you have changed back to Hyde lower yourself down through the hole
There is a health on a corner box to Hyde s left around the generators if you need it
Nancy found this when she was playing before she found the ceiling hole just in case you need it
Look for the staircase
You probably noticed it when you ran the last time and jump upon the presses
Go down the stairs and you will find yourself in a room with two robots guarding the place
If you look in front of you before you get to the bottom of the stairs you will see some boxes that are helter skelter
You have to pick one of these boxes up and go in back of the stairs
Keep going forward and you will find the elevator
The only way to open the elevator door is to throw a box at it
After you get on the elevator push the button and it will take you to the docks
DOCKSAs you enter the docks climb up on the crate and you will see a guard just below you
You can do him in or just jump to the next crate
A note of warning if you jump keep moving fast there is a sniper that will shoot at you
You have to get between the far two crates
Then move close to the first crate so the sniper can t hit you
Turn towards the ship and use your quot S quot key to line up your jump
Run forward and jump
Move to the far side of the ship
Jump and pull yourself up
Keep going in the same direction
You can t get past that brick wall so you have to move down on the side away from the sniper and walk forward
You will see a crate on the side
Get on this crate and jump up to get back to the top of the cargo this will put you on the other side of the brick wall
Again use your quot S quot key to run and jump onto the steerage roof which is a gold color keep on running and jump again through the window between the smoke stacks
The game will save here and you will meet Mr Yang
MEET MR YANGMr
Yang is very difficult to kill
You have to run and jump to him whack him as many times as you can then jump on the console and move back so he can t shoot his bubbles at you or bump you with his purple protection
The console is to the right of Wang
When he leaves his purple protection jump down and hit him some more then move out of his way again
Good luck I think I did this off and on for three days
Then I e mailed Nancy and I had to ask her how to do this part
She told me to try to find a spot where he can t hit you with the bubbles and close enough so you can move in for the kill
Once you get the best of him treat yourself to some health
Go over to the console and push the lever
A movie will show the doors opening on top of the large aquarium
Climb up on the aquarium and drop down through the opening walk to the window and smash it to let the water out
Keep hitting it so you don t loose your health
When all the water drains out walkout of the aquarium and you will change to Jekyll
Then go back in and pick up a piece of the puzzle
Remember Hyde cannot carry anything
Good Luck fellow gamers this is one of the hardest parts of the game
After you pick up the puzzle piece the game will go into a movie and it will show Dr Jekyll rowing a boat
Then it will cut to the wharf and your old friends will be there to greet you
DOCKSAfter the movie with the old friends you find yourself on a dock with two ramps
One of the ramps is next to you
Don t use this one instead run jump towards the other end
There are three guards down that way to avoid or kill
Also some of the boards are green if you walk on them you will fall through and have to start over so be wary as you move along
When you get past the last guard and to the ramp
Watch for the guard at the top of the ramp
When he is gone turn to your left and you will find a large door to go through that will take you to the railroad station
The bonus you get with this part of the game is if you accomplish something and have not lost too much health you can go to the quay side and save your game and then go back to the train side and save your game again
This was another great idea Nancy mentioned in her strategy guide to help you along
RAIL YARDThere are two things to accomplish in the rail yard
The first is to get to the tower and climb to the top and push the switch and the second is to get to the quot moving walkways quot
Jekyll can travel quite well by jumping from crate to crate
Once you see the tower scan the area to see where the guards are and when things look good run for it and jump over the railing to avoid the guard at the foot of the walkway
If you keep moving to the top of the tower the sniper should not hit you with any of his bullets
When you get to the top smash the glass with your cane and jump through the window
Move the lever and it opens some big doors that are to the north side of where you entered the rail yard
There is a movie sequence showing the doors opening
Again jump through the window and go back down
Once down near the bottom jump over the railing and run for the corner wall right in front of you so the sniper cannot shoot you
There is a box of health there if you need it
Run or find some crates to climb on and head back to the entrance
This would be a good place to save your game
Back at the entrance there is another red marked container with health in it just behind the crate on the left
I found the best way to get to those doors is by jumping from crate to crate and then on a kind of big machine that must load train cars
There are two train loading devices that you can jump on also there is some health in the second device
After you take the health bottle turn around and look for a guard
Actually the more guards you do away with the less you have to contend with later in the game when you revisit this area
There will be a guard to the right of you when you are looking toward the exit doors
I did away with this guard
Run to the loading dock to the far right
If you stand near the end of the bay you can see the guard walking back and forth
When he walks to the left run and jump up and hasten through the doors
This will take you to the quot moving walkway quot
MOVING WALKWAYSUse your quot S quot key to check for the three guards patrolling the area
When they are behind the boxes run zigzag to the end turn the corner and you will be on a stationary conveyor belt
Save your game here
Jump on the box and then to the walkway
Go forward toward the consol and jump kitty corner to get behind the sleeping guard
Give him a permanent nap and then move the levers on the consol
There are three levers but you only need to move the green handled one in the middle
That will show the big guy going for a fall
That is your destination also
There is one more guard to do away with on the way down there
Jump back kitty corner and climb the crate
When the guard walks away from you climb down and hide behind the next crate
When he comes back it take three good whacks to put him to sleep
I replayed this part a second time and I ran past him and went through the opening with no problem
BACK TO THE DOCKSThere is a movie right after you pass through the door from the moving walkways
When the movie is finished you find yourself standing in a crate
You can see a guard patrolling the area
When he is walking away from you climb out of the crate and run over to the crates to the west or left of the way Jekyll is standing
Wait for the guard to come back and you can take care of him
Look for the next guard he walks around several crates
All you have to do is follow him to get to the opposite side from where you are at and then you will see a console and a bottle of health near by
Throw the switch on the console and it will show a movie of a gangway lowering by the ship
Drink or take the bottle of health and go back the way you came avoiding the guard once again
SHIPWalk up the gangway and watch for a guard on the deck
There is a wheelhouse to your left when the guard is out of sight head for it
When you get in the wheelhouse there is a lever in there that will open doors on the deck that will lead to the cabins
There will be a movie here showing the doors opening on the forward deck
Again watch the guard and when it is safe head for the opening and jump in
The game will auto save here
Follow the guard down the steps and when you catch up whack him a good one
If you get to him before he turns the corner then turn to the left and stand at the end of the hall near the right wall
If he does turn the corner then whack him turn around and go the opposite way and hug the left wall when you get near to the end
Another guard will come and you can whack him
This guard is carrying a key to the cabins
There are only two things you need from the cabins one is another key to the Control Room and the other is a bottle of health
While you are looking for these items do not open any cabins at the end of end of the halls
Once you find the control key amp the bottle of health carry the control key in your hand
There is a guard in one of the end cabins you can not kill and if you carry the control key you won t be able to open his door
In the first cabin to your right when you come down the stairs you will find a hand grenade
You can have some fun with itif you want I did I blew myself up
CONTROL ROOMOnce you have found the control room you need to get the key out of your pocket a second time to unlock the second door
As you enter the room the story goes into a movie mode
When the movie is over run jump straight ahead and down the stairs
Turn to the right and you will see two doors one is in front of you and the other is to the left
Use the door on the left it takes you into the vault room where you will find another piece to the key
VAULT ROOMWhen you get close to the safe it will open automatically
Take the piece and quickly move up the stairs
The safe is rigged to flood the room so you have to change to Hyde in order to escape
When you get to the top of the stairs stop right there don t take any steps
Use your formula from that spot
I found if I took any steps Jekyll would not drink the formula and I would end up drowning
After you change to Hyde walk over to the door andhit enter to open the door
Now you have to head for the room with the robots
There are two robots in the room but you only have to deal with one of them
After you put him our of commission go throw the switch in the middle of the console
After you throw the switch the door behind you will open and the game will go into a movie showing the gangway moving to the door
Hyde will walk down the gangway
DOCKSWhen you get to the bottom turn to the right and climb the crate than jump over to the one towards the wall and then up on the wall
Walk along the wall until you see a crate on the other side
Jump to this crate
Keep jumping the crates and the game will again go into a movie mode
It will show Burwell fasten to the wall
He tells Hyde that the lawyer escaped but he got caught
Hyde is kind and finishes him off
I guess he didn t want to see him suffer or maybe he was trying to get even because of Laurie After the move sequence with Burnwell turn around and run over to the crates behind you
Move fast as there is a sniper out to get you
Climb up them to the top and jump over to the crane
You have to climb to the end of the boom and it will move by a window
Jump through the window or if you land on the ledge break the window
After you walk through the window you will end up in the rail yard once again
RAIL YARDAs you step out Hyde will grab the ledge
Drop him right on top of the health box below
If you miss and drop on the floor he will receive less health
The next part of the game is very difficult
There are a couple of snipers that will shoot at you
Your job is to run zigzag over to the engine of the train
Jump on the side you are running from
When you get on the engine throw the switch and the train will take off
I had a terrible time doing this I kept hitting my quot enter quot key instead of my quot control quot key
Good Luck gamers this is a trying spot
I know you all will get it on the first try
MAHARAJAHMeet the Maharajah he is your next conquest
If you stand by the end of the rd board of the track you can turn around and pick up the crate turn and throw it
You must hit the Maharajah when his vehicle is extended upward
Just keep picking up boxes and throwing and try hard to hit him
It seems to take several hits to finish him off
Once you do there is a box of health there but after I killed him I didn t find any thing in it
The game will go into a movie and you will see an old friend from the Opium House
Then you will be on top of a moving train
MOVING TRAINSRun and jump to the nd car watching out for the moving electricity
The rd car has electrical lamps that go on and off
You can broad jump to that car and then just walk under the lamps when they are turned off
The th car has a hole in the roof drop down in the car and get the quot key quot There is a robot down there but he doesn t bother you till you get to his end of the car
Take care of him and than go through the doorway
Use your quot S quot key and run jump to the next car
Open the door and then move to the side and watch fort the guard
When he comes follow him after he makes a turn and give him a good whack or two
The next car is safe but you will find a health bottle at the other end
The next car has a guard again take care of him as you did the first one
At the end of this car you should find a basin with water so you can change to Hyde
Go through the door and jump to the roof and than jump to the next car
A movie will show a guard unhitching the train cars
There s no going back now
Jump to the next car nothing there but the following car has energy lamps to avoid
The next car has two guards that are easily put out of commission
One good smack apiece and they are history
The next car has a hole in the roof and you can find a bottle of health
You re going to need it
Walk through the doorway and jump to the roof
The next challenge waits you meet the lightening throwing boss
What you need to do here is when he throws the electricity bolts jump over it and then jump again to land by him and give him a couple of smacks
He will send you back to the other end of the car and you have to keep repeating this until you hit him enough times
Just keep hitting him and soon the game will go into a movie and you will see the train crash
TRAIN CRASH SITEOnce you care of the lighting bolt man the game will go into a movie and show the train crashing
Fortunately Hyde is one tough dude and he survives
You will find him standing on a branch on the side of a cliff
There are three or four more of these he must climb to get to the top of the cliff
Walk him to the two boxcars and jump him through to the other side
Turn him so he goes back the way he came from and have him walk along the side of the railroad tracks
There is a robot patrolling around so jump over him or bop him what ever suits you
Soon you will come to an opening filled with booby traps
Beware of these they can lean over and do you great bodily damage
The tall cross like shape bends when you get near it and will do you great damage
The small white ones have sharp blades sticking out from them and if you jump and land on one it will kill you
Hug the walls where you can use your quot S quot key to look for the safest way to travel
I did a lot of angle jumping back and forth across the tracks
Some of the blades you can walk under when they go upward
You will find boulders to throw to open the gates
You will also find a bottle of health about three gates down on the left side of the track just before the next gate
GREEN ISLANDSLet the jumping begin
If after several jumps you don't have a lot of health restart this part of the game
When you get to one of the islands on the right side of the tracks it is partially submerged
If you don't have a lot of energy Hyde will die when you jump down
If you do make it down then go to the southern most end and turn and do a running jump to the next island
One of the jumps you make will be to a ledge on the left side of the tracks
Another jump that is difficult has a tree growing on it
You have to run and jump past the tree and land on the next island
It helps if you push the left arrow key right after you push the jump key
When you get to the long narrow ledge you will turn into Dr Jekyll
RESIDENCEAfter you get through the doorway from Green Isles you will be at the residence
There is a guard patrolling the yard
Walk over and hide behind the pillar
When the guard goes to the left or west walk across the steps to the other pillar
Wait for him to pass and then walk after him and when you get close enough give him a swat or two
He is carrying a key that you need to open the door to the warehouse
The door to the warehouse is just a little farther down and to the left
WAREHOUSEWhen you get into the warehouse there will be a robot walking back and forth
There will also be a box with health in it
I found if you use the health first it is harder to get through this room
So for the time being ignore the health
What you need to do is to run jump and zigzag to the other end of the room and go through a gate
There will be two more robots down there
Run past them or jump over them and keep going until you come to a console with a barged button on it
Give the button a swat and it will turn the machine offend disable the robots
Now you can go out and smash that case and enjoy a nice cool drink of health
There are a couple of methods for getting back there
One is to walk off center and have the big robot follow you
When you get to the last set of killer claws run and jump to the doorway and run past the other robots
Good Luck all
Now that you are rested and refreshed from drinking the health walk over tithe machine the claws are attached to
Climb up on the machine walk forward and climb again
Move forward but watch your step as there are some jumps to make
Keep climbing until you get to the top
After you get there look up and you will see an opening in the roof
Jump up and climb out
You are now on the rooftops
I hope you had a good rest because it is time to do some more jumping
ROOFTOPSThis segment of the game starts on the roof
Walk to the roof edge on the right where you will see an opening on the side of the roof
When you get there you will see some ledges sticking out
You have to run and jump to the first ledge
You know the drill use your S key
After you make the first jump you can jump to another ledge
Every time I make this jump I breathe window
There is a guard there so don t tarry or he will shoot at you
Jump again onto the balcony and then up on the railing on the far side and then jump to the next ledge
Be wary of the guard patrolling the hall
When you get to the end of the building you have to move upward and back the other way
Your goal is to get tithe chimney
When you get to the top you have to jump and grab the eave
Use your hands to move to the right
When you get past the fence pull yourself unto recoup your vial of time
Jekyll will fall but catch himself and your vial is full again
Then use your hands to go farther along
When you reach the next opening you can pull up and you will be able to stay there
The guard you saw below will be on the roof
He is hard to get to and to kill
Once he is eliminate broad jump over to the chimney and jump in
You can also try walking along the roof shingles and avoid the guard all together if you are quiet
The game will go into a movie showing you walking out of the fireplace into the library
Good Luck
LIBRARYWhen you walk out of the fireplace you are in the library
There are two enemies in here one is a cigar smoking guard the other is a lady vampire
You can run past the guard and just deal with the vampire
I found that after you strike her the first time pause and then strike her again
Keep repeating until she dies
She is carrying a key that you need
Place the key in your inventory and go to the cabinet and get the bottle of health
Turn around and you will see steps that will allow you to get on top of the bookcase
When you are halfway up the steps jump and pull yourself up
Turn around and jump kitty corner to the bookcase to your right
Stand close to the edge of the bookcase and get back as far as you can so you can run when you jump
There is another bookcase you must jump to and then unto the balcony
On the balcony you will see a guard walking back and forth
Use your S key to lineup the jump
You must be really straight if you are not you will miss landing on the bookcase
Your timing must be perfect here
I think this is the hardest part of the game
When the guard goes to the right watch him and when he turns and starts walking to the left run and jump and pull yourself up onto the bookcase
Then run amp jump to the balcony
Turn toward him and jump and start whacking him
I worked on this off and on for three days
Good luck gamers you can do it
When you subdue him go to the right end of the balcony where there is a door gate
Use the key from the vampire on it
GHOULS ROOMWhen you leave the library you enter the Ghouls Room
You are up on the rafters and there is a guard up here
When he passes by hurry to the other side
There is a place where you can lower yourself down and a bottle of your favorite brew is waiting
Go hide behind the pedestal where the vampire is or just observe the guard from the ledge you are on
Watch the guard walking the floor and you will see him tinkering with a machine
When he walks away follow him and give him couple of whacks
Then you can jump up on the pedestal and kill the female vampire with one blow
Now jump back down and go check out the machine the guard was playing with
It should shoot a rocket right through the exit door
If it does not work on the first try try it again
Pass through the chapel room and do in the guard or avoid him
In the next room is a man that is getting blood transfusions
There is a movie clip here
On his desk is a bottle of health
Every time you go through this room it will be replaced
When you go through the next exit door you will be in the book room
Good luck gamers this is a tricky puzzle and you need to have a good memory and a sure foot
You will see a chair up above you
Climb the stairs and walk over to the chair
Approach it from the side and push your enter key
Jekyll should sit down
Your job is to maneuver the robot through the maze to get the book and to bring it to the robot s starting point before the timer runs out
Study the card in the right hand corner of your screen
The pink colored sections are the only safe places to walk
If you get off the beaten path you will fall
Another thing do not pause moving the small robot every second counts there is just enough time to walk there get the book and come back
After you get the book walk to the left of the exit door
DeWitt the lawyer and another man will show up
There will be another movie sequence where good old DeWitt is telling the lawyer to kill Jekyll
The lawyer changes into a huge vampire
When Jekyll sees this he transforms into Hyde
The vampire attacks Hyde and then changes to a small bat and flies away only to return and strike again
The only way to beat this dude is to jump over by the exit door
Stand close enough to it so the vampire cannot get behind Hyde
When the vampire comes pound him a good one then try to take a step forward and swing again
You must make him fall down into the maze where you got the book
When that task is completed some members of the church come in and once again there is a movie clip
You then will find out about Howard Stoke Moran the man in the wheel chair getting blood transfusions
BISHOPS GATEWhen you get to the cemetery called Bishops Gate there is a movie clip
There are four things you need to find
A key
Laurie s doll
A Cross
Stevenson crypt
The first house on your right has the key
After you enter look on the floor to the left
The key is the only thing I m going to tell you how to find on this page
I will give you some hints how to survive
Until you find the cross run all the time
If you are running you can dodge or jump the vampires and they can t get you and these vampires are hard to kill
Once you have the cross you can walk but rememberevery time you move from one cemetery to another you must get the cross out of inventory againor you will be dead meat
When you find Stephenson s crypt the vampire there is extremely hard to kill
What I did was have the cross in my hand
Whence walks away from you follow behind and whack him
Then push the enter key so the cross will go up and ward him off
Keep alternating between these two things and eventually you will kill him
There are three cemeteries
They recalled Cemetery Start Cemetery Next and Statue Cemetery
On the next page I will draw a map for you to use if you cannot get this part by yourself
It is really petty easy
P S
After going through some of the gates check the coffins if you are lucky you might find some health if you need it
It will be replaced each time you leave the area Good Luckall you gamers remember keep running
I hope you can skip the next page but the map is there so you can find everything if you get desperate
Map of CemeteriesThe small lines on the map represent the gates STEVENSON SCRYPTAfter you enter Stevenson s crypt walk around on the floor eventually it will jiggle
Keep walking and you will fall through and a new adventure begins
When you land from the fall you will see a green river in front of you
On the left there is a rock holding some water
It is now time to transform into Hyde
There are zigzag jumps to make and then comes a harder one
There are logs floating down the river and you have to jump onto one of them
Do not relax too much once you succeed you will have to jump off to the left
If you don t you will get knocked off the log
Climb the rock formation and guess what
You will have to jump back on another log then you will have to jump off this log to the right
Once you land safely turn around and enjoy the beautiful waterfall
There is a small rock formation to walk up and then you will have about three easy jumps
You will then come to a formation with light streaks shining through
Use Hyde s mighty arms to smash your way through
Remember to save your game when you see the little clock
Follow the path and make a jump and you will find a bottle of health
Just past the health bottle is a boulder you can pick up
You have to throw the boulder at the rock formation behind you
It usually takes two or three boulders to knock it down
If you look over the edge of the ledge you will see a platform to your left that you can lower yourself to
You can jump from the main platform but you will lose some health
Use your quot S quot key and make a running jump to the pillar you just knocked down
From the pillar you have to jump through the large hole in the side of the mountain
When Hyde gets through the opening there is another jump or two and then he will land by a rock formation
Give the rock formation the old one two and it welcome tumbling down
Jump up on the rocks and climb to the top
There are two enemies up here
One is a guard towards the front and the other is an old tough female
You can avoid them by walking to the left side
When you get towards the front look for the guard so you know where he is
Stand so you can see the formation and also the guard
Use your quot S quot key to line up the formation between the walkways when the guard is walking away from you run and jump and land on the formation
Jump to the highest walkway on the right
Line up your next jump and go take card of the female vampire
The next jump will be an angle jump and there is a male vampire
After you make the jump the vampire will start toward you and the game will go into a movie showing mean vampires torturing a man
Then they will turn and look at you
You can do two things at this point
One is jump over the vampire guard and then jump up on the rocks
You are safe here and you can take the time to look around
The other thing you can do is to run and jump past the vampires if you do this you will be in the Green Tunnel
If you jump on the rocks and go through the hole in the mountain side you will end up in the Purple Tunnel
Nancy s has given me permission to add her walkthrough to this walkthrough
I will confess I have been through the tunnels but have yet to rescue sweet little cute little Laurie
But I am still working on it
I will succeed
So I would suggest you jump on the rock sand enter the tunnels from there End Game The Tunnels by Nancy Griffin This part of the game can be confusing and sometimes the last straw for anyone who has been struggling through this game
My hope is that this little bit of direction will help you to get to the boss fight at the end of the game with a sense of satisfaction at having completed a very difficult game
Julia has done a beautiful job of getting you to this point so let s make her proud and finish this one
You need to start in the purple tunnel for this walk through
To get there let s start back where the two vampires were torturing the priest on a spit and one other vampire is running around ready to attack
As soon as you jump from the wooden walkway the roaming vampire comes to attack
Run past him on your right and under the wooden structure
Run and jump onto the rock formation to your left
You are safe here so take a look around
To your right you can see the two vampires still having the bonfire
To your left is a wooden gate
You need to walk straight ahead and jump to the ledge right in front of you
When you enter this cave you are in the purple tunnel
Let the game begin
Purple Tunnel Save your game
The first thing that you see is a closed bamboo gate with a guard health and a level map behind it
Walk to your left and turn right at the intersection
Take the first left and enter a room with rocks
Have Mr Hyde pick one up one of the middle ones return to the barred gate and toss the rock to break it open
Enter the room kill the guard take the health and study the map
The map showsthree rooms surrounding a main central room where the boss fight takesplace
Each room is connected by adifferent colored tunnel and also to the central main room
The library is on the bottom right the larder is the bottom left the worship room is the very top and the central room is the dormitory
The purpose of this level is to destroy three main pillars one in each of the three surrounding rooms and retrieve the Book
We are going to head down the purple tunnel to the library
Leave the map and go back towards the room with the rocks
Walk past this room and continue till you can see the tunnel split up and down
Take the quot up quot walkway jump across the chasm with falling rocks and run past the vampire and straight into the library
One note here this looks like a dead end but is not
There are dead ends but they look like the surrounding tunnel's walls
The Library Save you game here
Do a standing jump to the platform in front of you
Smack the green light to break it
Line Mr Hyde up on the left side of the platform and make a running jump to the next platform with the lady vampire on it
If you stand next to the main pillar you might be able to smack her without taking any damage
If you kill her go get the health first if not just run past her to the right and climb up onto the small platform in front of the green light
Whack the light to break it and you get a cut scene of the vampire platforms falling
You are now standing on a ledge
Walk two paces turn around and jump to a higher level
Turn around and walk clockwise till you get to a painted beam in your path
Pull up onto it
Walk up to the center pillar and jump to the cross beam on your left
Walk the beam all the way to the wall
There are rocks here to pick up
If you see no rocks check the other beams
Some rocks are hard to see and blend in with the wall and some in other rooms are different colors
You need to throw rocks at the central pillar to destroy it and the painted pillar slides out of sight and into the dormitory
Walk back to the rocks and you should be able to save the game
Jump the broken beams until you are on the opposite one from the rocks
You can climb down here
Walk this ledge until you come to the narrow part and let yourself down
If you are having trouble doing this try running off the edge and you will land on the next ledge
From here do a standing jump then a standing jump then a standing jump and then a drop down
Turn around and run off the edge to the tunnel ledge
Enter the tunnel and you are back at the purple tunnel
Purple Tunnel Second Time Save your game
Retrace your steps to the start of the game
In other words go forward jump across split and chasm till you get to the rock room
Grab another rock and go to the intersection at the beginning of the level and turn left to return to the gated room
Use the rock to bash the gate and get the health
It has magically reappeared
Go back to the intersection and turn left and enter the Larder room
The Larder Save your game
Do a standing jump to the ledge on the left
Walk to the end of it and do a standing jump to the next higher ledge
Turn around and jump straight up then push the forward arrow key to grab the beam and pull up
This is the beam with the rocks
They are the same color as the wall and you must get very close to them on the left side to get Mr Hyde to pick them up
Use four of them on the central pillar to destroy it and the painted beam will slide out of sight and into the dormitory
Two down one to go
Turn around and walk back to the rocks
You can save your game
You can get down the way you came up if you run off the beam to land on the end of the closet highest ledge
If you can t do it then go across the beams to the brightly lit ledge and go down that way
Run off the next ledge or hang and drop to the green beams and enter the purple tunnel a third time
Purple Tunnel Third Time Save your game
Go forward past the rock room to the split up and down
This time go down
Drop to the ledge and then to the tunnel floor
Kill the guard
Stand in front of the ledge with your back to it and take about steps forward
Turn around and look up to the ceiling
Pull up and get the health
Drop back down and continue in the same direction
Drop down to the next ledge and tunnel then continue forward into the larder again
The Larder Second Time Mr Hyde needs to go to the left
Walk off the end of the ledge and go that way
Walk past the burning post and pull up onto the very next ledge
Walk forward to enter the orange tunnel
Orange Tunnel Save your game
Walk forward past the split quot up quot kill the vampire and get the health from the wall
Continue down the tunnel run and jump both chasms and stay in the middle to avoid the grabbing hands
Walk to the end and enter the dormitory

There is a health on the floor but save it for later unless you absolutely must have it
Walk to your right and enter the next tunnel
This is the gray tunnel
Gray Tunnel Save your game
Jump onto the rock in front of you and pull up into the higher part of the tunnel
Run past the guard jump the chasm and run to the end of the tunnel into the worship room
Worship Room Going Up Save your game
You start out in the Devil s mouth on his tongue
You will be coming back this way again as you need to get back to the Dormitory for the boss fight and end of the game
Walk off the side of the tongue drop down and drop down again to land in the pool of blood
Go forward to the flaming gargoyle and pull up onto his head
If you can t do this pull up onto the smaller ledge and jump to the gargoyle
Jump up to the ledge to the right of the gargoyle and pull up to the next ledge
Turn around and do a standing forward jump to the next highest ledge then pull up onto the gargoyle
Jump to the toothy ledge to the left of the gargoyle then left again to the next gargoyle

Drop to the red beam by the blood pool and walk to the left of the Devil s head
Walk to the beam beneath the head and approach the book
You turn back into Dr Jekyll
Save your game
Walk into the red pool and pull up onto the Devil s chin and then pull up onto the tongue
Turn and enter the gray tunnel again
Gray Tunnel Second Time Save your game
Run and jump over the chasm
Run past the guard and run off the end and onto the ledge
Drop down and continue the same direction and enter the dormitory for the final fight
Dormitory End Game Save your game
Walk to your left and climb the slanted beam
I did not touch the last health just yet
Walk all the way up to the third beam and save your game
Pull up onto the top ledge and watch a cut scene
Save your game immediately after the cut scene
You are now Hyde and need to pick up the boulders lying around the ledge and toss them at the three center beams
It takes three boulders to destroy each beam
The Boss moves in a clockwise direction and you can pretty much avoid him at first
Stay away from the shining green fourth beam
You cannot destroy it and it will do you harm
The boss moves faster as you do damage to the beams
If you are really good you can beat the boss and walk down the last shiny green beam to get Laurie and watch the cut scene
Happy ending
I on the other hand had to descend down the slanted beams to go get the other health at the bottom
Be careful leaving the ledge to get on the slanted beam
It is very hard
Hang and use your left arrow key to move to the beam and Hyde will stand up
I entered the red cave to look for more health but found none
I reentered the dormitory and the boss was gone
After I climbed back up I just walked over to Laurie s cage and the end cut scene started
Happy ending too

JEKYLL AND HYDE Game Developers Pixelcage bitComposer Walkthrough by robbo January Extract from Coltrane's diary When Lord Grayshire disappeared I hoped that this would put an end to the horror and for a while it did
Dr Jekyll bought the establishment and our trust in each other grew quickly
It did not escape my notice that he felt very drawn to Miss Cunningham and she soon reciprocated his attentions
All seemed to be well
However Dr Jekyll was incredibly ambitious
When a peculiar disease began to spread in London he became totally focused on conquering it
Of course I energetically supported him in every way possible but I did not foresee that a small mishap would lead him to discover the secrets surrounding Lord Grayshire
Th is was the beginning of a melee of events which would not only lead to Dr Jekyll having to become familiar with his darker side but that would ultimately determine the destiny of our world hellip ldquo Main Menu Continue loads the last saved game

Go upstairs to the nd floor and see a corridor with gaps in the floor
Insert the mechanism you found earlier into the console at right
See the swinging axes and trapdoors in the floor
This isn't too hard just run fast at angles from one 'safe trapdoor' to the next If you land on any other you plunge to your death
Not sure if the safe ones are random but the symbols on the stones match the letters on the package in Inv
These are the blocks that worked for me rd from the left on the first row then nd on the second row then th rd st and nd
So for example on your first run stand on the rd block wait for the axe to clear the way and dash at an angle to the second block in the next row
Then to the th block on the next row and so on
MINOTAUR'S LAIR At the end of the corridor is the Minotaur's lair
Don't be scared Walk along his arms ndash be careful though you might fall off to place the horns covers on the ends of the creature's own horns See the mouth opening and enter it
Here's another axe jump trap jump and avoid go forward
SAVE PATHS AMAZING
You enter a large hall with consoles one of which has a diagram of corridors showing obstructions and levers to manipulate them Note the open door opposite which leads to the first labyrinth The map represents a real location you have to get through Only the one console will work at the moment Moving the levers opens and closes barriers but some levers not only open one barrier they may close others so you have to go back and re open it
MAZE If you number the top levers to and the side levers to then levers and open close the top left barrier levers for the top right one for the L shaped object in the middle which is actually a cage device which swings across blocking one route and opening the other route Levers control the far left barrier and the bottom nearest one The goal is to reach the room at the top of the map
One solution for the switches is and Make a note of the directions to take to get you through the maze Maze is fairly simple and there's only one route through to the target room
Press Space to exit the map
Now enter the actual labyrinth and make your way to the room
When you come to the blade traps be Hyde of course and press ' ' to give some extra oomph and jump crawl past them
I think he can get away with 'hit' so I just jump over the lower blade and walk through the upper one
He complains but just ignore him
When you get through Maze collectSNAKE and make your way back to the hall Completing this opens the cover on the maze console
MAZE See there's an extra switch down the side so they are numbered to
Press switches
There are no real dangers in this maze just a couple of chasms for you to fall into CollectSNAKE and return to the hall SAVE PATHS MAZE Switches There are jets of flame to avoid here
Be Hyde and just wait for the ones which shoot across the passage to stop then step forward There's a couple which shootalongthe passage here you just have to move quickly to avoid Reach the sculpture at the other end and place the snakes You don't have to go back through the maze because a ramp extends in front of you ndash so go forward SAVE PATHS to an altar
Place the book and a door opens go through it and across a walkway Be Hyde Note a machine there are of them which tries to grab him and 'power towers'
Crouch down next to the tower wait for the machine to grab hold of the tower if it misses just adjust Hyde's position until it hits the tower press ' ' to give him strength crawl away from the tower keep Ctrl pressed down and stand up release Ctrl and turn around
When you see the 'hand' icon press Enter once and Hyde should destroy the machine
Do this for the others
After each hit a barrier is withdrawn and he can advance a bit further round the walkway until eventually Jekyll can approach another ramp which appears and cross it to get thePAGE
Go back out to the previous altar and use the page on the book
There's a cut scene where something is happening to the Tome
ldquo The Tome it has become stronger
What power
As if coming from another world rdquo Take the Tome and enter the new door
There's another cut scene with Coltrane and the book
Next he is back in the mines and wants to explore the tunnels
SAVE MINES PART THE MINES OF CHRONOS Follow the bottom rail left to an open area there are boards on the floor
Get theCROWBARoff the table andPARAFFINoff the shelf
Go back to the main area and see a wagon with a usable lamp on it
Get the empty LAMP
Combine paraffin and lamp and matches
Follow the bottom track to the right of the wagon where there's a wooden fenced entrance to the furnace area WORKING IN THE FOUNDRY The rail is damaged and Jekyll Hyde must make a new one
Attach the lamp to the wagon Flick the switch on the back right wall to move the mould towards the furnace
In the far corner is a shelf
Get morePARAFFIN go to the furnace and use the paraffin on it
Light the furnace Behind the big rock to the left of the furnace is a handle for the bellows
Jekyll can't turn it so be Hyde and turn it Go up the stairs to the top of the furnace and turn the handle to pour the molten metal into the mould Flick the switch again to move the mould back where it was and turn the valve on the water tower to cool the rail
Hyde replaces the old rail SAVE MINES Use the wagon for a ride through the mines and press Enter Control as required You might find that sometimes Jekyll doesn't respond quickly enough to your key presses so when you see the hand try tapping the key several times no need to bash it
to make sure the action is 'registered'
At the end he plunges down and becomes Hyde Jump right and again then down onto a ledge press ' ' and push the pillar
Climb up into a tunnel where Hyde torments Jekyll
Follow the tracks left SAVE MINES At the back of this area see a control panel
Flick the switch and go through the lit entrance
Go left to get aPAGEand see some fast moving spikes
You can't tackle these yet so go back and right to a living area GetPHIALof Heliasbud powder andRECIPE use the lab the portions are and to make a potion which increases life force and endurance GetSATURNand examine it in the Inv to get SaturnRINGS Read papers on the desk getPAGE getTORCHoff pillar and light it GetCASKETand exit the cave to the tunnel at bottom left
Take the side tunnel at the top and smell gas
Use Hyde to jump down left across the chasm approx where the vegetation is and up to a tunnel towards the top right of the screen there are some large rocks that look like steps up
You'll have to use the number keys here for Hyde to survive
Tricky
Jump down see a skeleton and get aRECIPE
Go right as far as you can and getMUSHROOMS ndash the fungus from which Ambrosia can be made
Use the lab portions and to make a potion which gives power vitality and greatly sharpened senses
Go back to the tunnel back across the chasm phew
and back to the lit entrance
Now you can get past the spikes as the potion has the effect of slowing them down There are groups with gaps in between them Try this take steps forward press your number keys then steps should get you through the first lot ndash wait until they're open of course then just repeat until you reach safety
Enter a large hall SAVE MINES There are areas you can reach to the left and right and forward is a plinth with a bust on it ldquo Snakes on the head that is Medusa rdquo plus a blocked opening behind it
Turn right and go into the top room and at the back wall place the Saturn Rings in the alcoves to get aGOLDEN DAGGER
Be careful it's very sharp
Go out and directly across to the other hall See the giant statue of Zeus He seems to have a headache mmm wonder if that's a clue to finding the next object
Go left to the 'Hephaestus' hall
Hephaestus was blacksmith to the Olympian Gods See his furnace with it's chute for molten metal
Look at the furnace and switch it on ndash wow it's a fully automatic gas furnace
At the box on the right get someCLAY Use the clay on the barrel to getWET CLAY Go up the stairs opposite the statue and go left
Be Hyde to jump across and behind Zeus Jump onto the chair arm then the chair back ldquo Henry we need that head rdquo Press ' ' and knock his head off Go down to the floor and drag the head into the other hall
See the giant hammer and place the head where you think the hammer will strike ndash it's approx
at the intersection of the statue's fingers and the far corner of the rail Flick the switch on the back wall to activate the hammer and break the head open
Get theOBJECTfrom its centre
As Hyde reset the hammer with the other wall switch as it's needed to climb on
Go up the stairs and to the right jump across to a corridor see a rostrum with an oval opening Place the object there and enter Athena's temple SAVE MINES THE TEMPLE OF ATHENA ldquo That's Athena mighty goddess of wisdom and the art of war Did Perseus not use Athena's shield to conquer Medusa rdquo You can't get it yet
See the patterns on each left and right wall Click on the left circle of dots
Start at the top and go clockwise to change each 'blob'
Do the same with the right wall blobs and on the th Athena will loosen her grip and give up her shield Get theSHIELDand examine it SERPENT
Go back to the main hall what was that mighty rumble
ndash it was the hammer falling by itself or did it
down right and down to the floor
SAVE MINES Combine the casket clay serpent to get aMOULDso you can make another serpent
Put the mould under the chute on the furnace Put the dagger in the furnace and watch your creation take shape new hot SNAKE in a box
Get it and use on the barrel cool SNAKE Go out of here to the main room and to the Medusa head place the snakes there and go through to a new area Go behind the altar at the far side SAVE MINES and place the Tome to get your next challenge
You'll see a round 'pond' surrounded by what look like car factory robots and there's a Medusa creature floating around in the water
The creature will of course attack you and try to kill you
The idea is to use Athena's shield to reflect the rays from the creature back to the creature to weaken it
As Hyde use the shield go to one of the gaps in the fence
Hopefully the creature will approach you and shoot and when the rays bounce back and hit it it will be temporarily weakened
Be close enough for the hand icon to appear then press Enter to kick the creature away across the water
It should end up under one of the 'robots' Run round the other side and while it's incapacitated flick the robot's lever and it will poke the creature with it's knife spear sharp thing Remember to get the shield back in hand for the next attack Wait for it to recover and attack again
Keep doing this until the creature is dead
You may find like I did on several occasions that the creature is too fast for you or I was too slow
and it repeatedly starts to turn those robots around so that you can't reach the lever
See connected to each robot and set back from them is a handle which you can turn to turn the robot right way round But I found this so slow and frustrating that I gave up and started the level again by loading from the saved game which is 'MINES '
When the creature is defeated go to the central island get thePAGEand put it on the altar and see the Tome absorb even more energy
There's a cut scene with Ann SAVE RIVER PART BURNING RIVER In the next part he is on a broken bridge over some lava Walk along the top edge of the bridge to see a stone he can use to walk across and jump down to a walkway Be Hyde to jump across and climb right and finally jump down to another walkway Go up screen to see a big door held closed with claws Use the console to make an L shaped bridge swing across
Jump over to the bridge and follow the walkway left See another console and note a closed opening to the left of it you will eventually return here through that door Use the console and cross the bridge mind the gap near the other end Go past another console and up the steps SAVE RIVER Go down into a cave light the torch and follow the tunnel
The next part of the game is to collect gems hidden in rooms which set different types of challenges and hazards
FIRE MAZE Look out for the first side tunnel at the top of the screen and follow it to the Fire Maze room
This consists of several mesh screens laid out in the form of a maze with fire shooting up through the floor The method is to enter the maze in about the middle go right towards the right hand wall then round a screen then left roughly through the centre to the left wall then to the back of the room then right to the hall containing the ruby RED GEM Press the number keys to help him endure the heat and stop and wait for fire jets to finish before proceeding
When you get the gem you'll see one of the big claws on the door release its grip
You have to go back through the maze to escape back to the main tunnel
SAVE RIVER FIREBALLS Go right to a chasm
Jump onto a small suspended rock and over to the other part of the tunnel
Very close to here is another side tunnel leading to the Fireball corridors Be Hyde and dodge fire balls shooting along and above the corridors Use protection and crawl and when you have to jump a gap in the floor use slow motion to slow the fireballs down and give him time to stand and jump Go down the side corridor and see some stairs up Be careful as there's fireballs coming at you higher up and from behind Remember to crawl at the top near the danger area
Follow the corridor round and get theYELLOW GEM Make your way back to the main tunnel SAVE RIVER DRAGON WALL Go right and up screen ndash just before the lava river to the Dragon Wall room Here there's a block puzzle to solve
ldquo Let me see what needs to be done here rdquo Click on the blocks to press them in
Some blocks make other blocks move out again Clue there are blocks to press in and the aim is to create a safe path from the right of the wall across to the stairs at the left of the room If you get stuck see the diagram at the end of this walkthrough ndash just press the numbers in sequence When successful you will be released from the puzzle and you can become Hyde to climb up the wall of fire breathing dragons Use slow motion again
I climbed up the second column
Jump left onto the staircase and up to the gem room to get another ruby RED GEM Go back to the last console the one you haven't used yet up steps and down and use it to activate another bridge Go back up the steps and go left mind the gaps to a new tunnel
KILLER BLADES Go first left to the revolving blades room
Tricky
If you use ' ' to slow the motion down and look at the right hand area there's a certain time when you can see a clear path through
You have to make a dash for it
It took me lots of goes to do this
Any contact with a blade kills him
Once through jump across the pillars avoiding the blades of course and get theBLUE GEMthen go back to the main tunnel PILLAR JUMPS Go right to a large cavern where there's a beam of light projected onto the far wall
Use a blue gem on the projector
The door will close and some pillars will appear between you and the far wall Jump across bearing left to get anotherBLUE GEM
Go back to the projector and take back the blue gem
At the end of all this you should have the gems ndash blue red and yellow and the locks on the big door will all be released
Return through the tunnel to the bridge SAVE RIVER CUT SCENE AS Jekyll steps onto the bridge it swings around and he is trapped
Rufus is standing on a distant bridge demanding that Jekyll hands over the Tome for the benefit of the Children of Kronos
Of course our hero refuses and Rufus goes on his way for now
Look at the large gap between the bridge and land and Jekyll decides he can't tackle it
So be Hyde and jump
Then jump down to the right press ' ' and ' and leap across
Keep going down then crawl right through a tunnel to what looks like a generator room quot A heating system quot
Go to the table in the centre and read the notes about an elixir
Ambrosia fungus and Hercules Root
Go down screen to get a conveniently placed Hylecereus Draco plant Use the Lab and the proportions are and to make a potion to protect from fire and heat for short periods
Now go up the stairs top right to a rocky area flowing with lava Jump down and follow the rock path around to the edge of the lava You can see moving blocks and guess what
You have to jump on these to get to your next location
Be Hyde and jump on a block
It's about to slide down a lava waterfall so take your potion to ensure you survive through to the other side When you emerge jump onto the bit of land jutting out otherwise you'll get knocked off
Jump back onto another block and after a short ride jump off back onto land
Climb up to a new area of the complex Look at the broken lift if you like
Go up screen up the stairs and right flick the switch on the wall
Go through the opening and you're back to the place I pointed out earlier near the console
SAVE RIVER Use the console and go right to cross the L shaped bridge
Go up screen and through the now open big doors
SAVE RIVER See the altar so it's Tome time again
Go forward to your next challenge
A large circular arena go towards the far side
quot What sort of devilry is at play here quot Doors lock and a dragon creature rises from the centre of the arena
Note the coloured beams coming from its body Go around and follow each beam to where it hits the wall Place gems in the holes in the wall
Blue at the top then Red then Yellow and in the bottom hole put gems one red and one blue to make a purple beam Now the creature will be activated
The idea is to drain the thing of power by letting it fire at you and absorbing the rays Use all your protection
You can run around a bit to let your protection build up
You should see the coloured lights on its head going out as it loses power
Well that's the theory
Not always so easy but stick with it When its defeated get the last page and add it to the Tome SAVE FINAL PART THE FINAL HOUR There's a cut scene with Rufus ldquo despicable cur rdquo and Ann quot Henry it's a trap quot
Go forward to the door and examine it open it
You are in a warehouse
Go up the stairs on your left and you can see the target area a walkway above one of the rooms with a ladder leading up
If you look around you'll see various large boxes ideal for climbing up I would think
The idea here is to create jump points in both rooms so Hyde can get across to that ladder
He can only jump the height of one box so we'll have to create a sort of step affair for him to climb up
This is how I did it if you can see a better way then let me know Go to the right hand room and look left
There's a stack of boxes
Nice but too high to reach yet
Look right and there's a single box which might be handy
Directly in front see a stack of two boxes
They conveniently have handles on them
Go to the boxes look at them then be Hyde and drag push these boxes towards the room's entrance gate not too close so you can get out of the room Try to place them roughly in the middle between the single box and the other stack
Now go through to the other room and see the stacks of boxes in there
Do the same drag the movable ones to about halfway between the two stacks
Now go back to the first room and climb onto the single box in the far corner
Leap across to the middle stack then onto the other stack then onto the walkway between the rooms
I found it best to jump at an angle because Hyde tends to overshoot the target and you have to start again
Now jump onto the nearest boxes in room then across to the middle and across to the boxes railing and over to the ladder Up the ladder to a new area
SAVE FINAL Go forward and look at the central console quot identical symbols with holes quot
Go right and look at the panel on the wall Get two 'parts' and go back to the centre open Inv and place the parts there Turn the circles until the white lines match the pattern in the panel you looked at Go forward to the next panel and do exactly the same Go left and look at the cog wheel on the floor too heavy to lift
Be Hyde and get the cog
Go near the wall press ' ' to help him concentrate and keep pressing Enter until he places the cog on it's axle
This activates the third panel Repeat the process on the console
Now go left and left again up the stairs and up the ladder SAVE FINAL Go forward to the wall panel and place the bits from the Inv
A lot of big machinery starts up Go left and down screen up the stairs Jump on the moving platform crouch down under the beam stand and jump onto the walkway then onto the revolving platform Jump off onto the gantry go round to another machine with several platforms going the wrong way I managed this one eventually by making small adjustments to his direction after each jump
As long as you stay slightly ahead of the movement you should be able to reach the back of the machine where there's a walkway to jump on
Next a platform on a revolving wheel careful you don't stand too far away and plunge down
Then jump off the other side onto another walkway then up a ladder to a new level
SAVE FINAL Jekyll is searching for a 'collector' in the tower I think he means an altar type place for the book to go ndash and is searching the levels to find it
Here there are massive weights suspended by chains Be Hyde and jump onto them and across to the other side
There's a control panel here with levers to adjust the positions of the pendulums Pull levers and
Be Hyde and jump on higher weights to get to a ramp and ladder in the corner to a new area top of tower SAVE FINAL HELL'S BELLS Jump onto the big cog duck under the beam and jump onto the walkway on the other side Follow it round and take the first left Here there's a rotating cog Jump to its centre or run over it to the chest on the other side Place the Tome and go back over the cog and turn left up screen Jump onto the moving platform duck jump onto the horizontal cog climb up onto the walkway see the gap in the railing
Go left follow it round to a ladder and new area SAVE FINAL GOOD HEAVENS Here is a room with diagrams of constellations on each wall
In the centre of the room there are controls one for each diagram There are four rotating drums with a marker on each which represents the position of each of the bright stars in the diagram The aim is to move the drums up or down to match the positions of the stars relative to each other Only one is available to start with so use the up and down pointers to adjust the drums
When you have completed the first one the next becomes available and so on
You'll see that its not quite straightforward in that some pointers control adjacent drums
Number is THE TWINS Letter the drums A B C amp D Click on the 'D' up arrow so the notch on D is at the top Click on the 'C' down arrow so it's notch is at the bottom Click on the 'B' up arrow twice Click on the 'A' down arrow twice Number LEOClick the down arrows so that all the notches are in a line at the bottom Now click 'B' up twice then 'D' down once B up B down B up B down Number SAGITTARIUS Start with all notches down C up C down then repeat D up and C down until solved Number HERCULES Start all down A up B down A up B down C up A up A down
When you've done all four Jekyll becomes Hyde at a new location
SAVE END PART THE END OF THE WORLD Hyde stands on one side of a lava chasm where molten lava flows below
Leap across the chasm but beware ndash large chunks of lava break off and slide away Use the number keys to keep up his strength and resistance Eventually he arrives at a rocky outcrop Leap the gap towards the clock parts strewn around the new area Now you're going to have to do a lot of leaping jumping and running across rocks and lava some of it moving or crumbling to reach your goal which is London's Tower Bridge Along the way there are several save points You could call them temporary saves as they are not saved to your hard drive they are used in case your character gets killed and you can go back to that place
Anyway you'll have seen them all through the game so far Where they occur I've put ' save '
Jump the chasm and go left jump across the pillars to a rocky platform
There are jumps up to another platform save Jump down and across more crumbling pillars to yet another platform save
Now go forward across the rocky slabs and follow a path round the rising lava lake and up to a plateau ldquo Huh quick away from here rdquo so go forward blocks SAVE END Now don't leap forwards jump down onto the slab to the left then forwards You'll get a short cut scene with a view of the bridge Forward again save then jump pillars onto a flat area then onto a sort of jetty save where you can see floating pillars probably lava
The aim is to reach a similar jetty on the other side of the lake but its much higher than this one so start by jumping onto the lowest passing pillar and from there jump onto successively higher ones I think there are in all then jump off when you can on the other side SAVE END Go forward jump down go right jump pillars climb up to a platform turn right
save
Do jumps go left jump down save towards the pillars Make jumps to the flat area go right jumps flat area left jumps to flat area climb up twice go forward and right slightly then up ahead left up and then up big 'steps' to a broken wall In about the middle you can see some big stone slabs
Climb then turn left bit tricky to position but climb up left then up more slabs to the top save Go left and be Jekyll
There's a weird cut scene with some kids locked up behind bars ldquo Wait I'll get you out of there immediately rdquo STEAM POWER Now Jekyll is at the bridge control panel It's operated by steam apparently and you have to adjust the controls to make the bridge open Play around with the valves to open the bridge
Number the valves to along the top and to on the bottom Press and Go across SAVE END See deadly discharges on the bridge
Be Hyde and dodge the lightning and holes to the other side
Now a portcullis slams down and Hyde is trapped with a killer drone thing
Run into a corner and when the drone attacks you dash out of the way so it short circuits on the water
Repeat in each corner until it's dead ldquo Bull's Eye rdquo then a gate will open and let you out As Jekyll you enter the lord's residence ldquo So this is where his spiteful lordship resides rdquo SAVE END See a model of planets There are rings which control their positions relative to each other and the universe ndash so it seems quite complex
Note that Jekyll tells us the model is 'heliocentric' the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around a stationary Sun at the centre of the solar system but I don't know what difference it makes
Use the arrow keys to switch circles The outer one rotates all planets together Use combinations of the others to make planets go further from and closer to each other I got the purple Saturn and the blue Earth in their right places and played around with the others until they finally clicked in place The smallest planet a purply colour seems to go on the yellow beam The others are green and orange
When you've got it right a secret door opens Go through towards the bridge
The scene changes to the inside of one of the bridge towers The lord has you trapped in the middle of some Tesla machines Lord ldquo Thanks to your good self the Tome has become more powerful than we would ever to have dared imagine rdquo About the children ldquo You see Doctor the almighty Kronos always demands the presence of innocent souls at his rituals so that he can feast upon them rdquo Of course Jekyll is horrified that he has unwittingly aided this dastardly lot
The lord leaves and Jekyll changes into Hyde Jump into the centre of the machine to wreck it
Back as Jekyll ldquo Groan What happened
My head ah my things everything destroyed rdquo Leave this place and go out onto the bridge SAVE END Now there's a cut scene with the lord Rufus Ann and Jekyll Ann is hanging off the side of the bridge she must be a strong girl
and in mortal danger Lord tells Jekyll he must choose the world or Ann but there's no actual choice in the game that I can see it just continues as described below
Automatically be Hyde Rufus is further along the bridge using his powers to try to kill you
There are circles of giant rocks flying around in front of you Make your way through the rocks avoiding the holes in the bridge and when you are getting close to Rufus get ready with the Enter key Use the number keys first to give him strength and when you see the hand icon bash the Enter key like mad to reflect the energy back to Rufus and knock him backwards down a hole
ldquo My son my son you have killed my son rdquo ldquo You will live to regret that you paltry quack rdquo The scene changes again There are rocks circling above the bridge Hyde is standing on one and can see the lord in the distance Walk jump right until you come to a group of rocks alongside the route up screen and jump on it This takes you closer to the lord so watch out he's going to attack There are some smaller rocks flying past you so when one is in front of you press Enter to throw it at the lord you should see the hand icon Now he is going to shoot his evil energy at you Again use the strength keys and get ready with the Enter key Bash the Enter key to absorb the blow
OK you beat him once You have to do this twice more I think ndash I had to anyway Finally you finish him off and he floats away into the skies There's a final cut scene the Tome is on an altar and a bright light is beating down on it It's destroying the book which shoots off the altar onto the floor

GAME BOOMERS hints cheats and walkthroughs
Storm Troopers Watch out for the usual assortment carrying Blasters Repeaters and Rail Guns
In some areas Storm Troopers will quot respawn quot by being dropped in by shuttles
Scout Troopers They carry the Blas Tech
This is a very accurate weapon so be wary
Even at a distance you're vulnerable
Imperial Officers Tougher and better shots than Troopers
Rebel Soldiers These guys are on your side but be careful around them especially during a fight
It's very easy to hit them with a stray shot or an errant lightsaber swing
What's more if you get between them and Imperial Troops you might accidentally get a laser in the back
AT STs There are a couple of them here so save your rockets
Level Walkthrough Walk through the door and hang a left going upstairs to the control room
You can drop an A Wing on some troopers and try to close the hangar doors by flipping the switches in this room if you like
Drop down and assist with the fighting
Clear the area and head over to a control room
A wall will explode and in come the Troopers
Blow 'em away
SECRET There is a ledge above this control room
There are probably Troopers on it
Kill them and Force Jump up
You will notice a hole in the ceiling to the rear
Look up and fire a shoot to get the attention of the Troopers above
As they look down kill them quickly then Force Jump up through the hole
Exit the area via corridor underneath the ledge
This will lead you to another control room
Kill the troopers inside jump up on the balcony and take an elevator to the control area overlooking the room with the rebel solders and the R unit
In this chamber there is a grate in wall above the window
Slash it and go through
You will come to another grate in the floor
Slash it and drop down into the fight
In this new area you will come across two doors one is locked
Go through the unlocked door You will enter the infirmary
Search each room for items and weapons keeping an eye out for Imperials
The room closest to the hole where Imperials are coming through contains the Blue Key
SECRETS AND When you enter the infirmary look up at the ceiling
Notice the cross beams that span across the ceiling
Position yourself between any two of the cross beams and use the Force Jump to jump on top of any one of them
You will see a force surge on one end and a backpack on the other
Go back to the locked door and press the green switch
The door will now open
Clear out the Imperials and follow the corridor to and elevator
This will take you to a new control room
Help out the Alliance Troops then get up on the catwalk to the upper level via the elevator or Force Jump
You will enter a control room on this new floor and receive a quick briefing
Exit via the other door of this room
Explore this new area until you come to a control room
Another Rebel Officer will ask you to switch on auxiliary power
SECRET Follow a series of quot elbow quot corridors
The one just before the wide open area that leads to the generators has a slashable grate
Whack get the goodies and continue
SECRET Returning to the large room just before the back up generator there is a door you were not able to open before
Go through it
In this room is the regular base generator
Drop over the rails you see inside
You will find another slashable grate
Once the back up generator is on and the secret collected return to the area with the Rebel Officers who asked you to turn on the power there is also an R unit here
A door you were previously unable to open should can now be opened because the power is on
Go through it
SECRET Follow the corridor until you come into another landing bay
In one corner of this area is a slashable grate
Blow it open and go in
Passing into an adjoining cargo area you will be required to defeat an AT ST Use your rail gun to do it
If you go outside and look to another cliff to the left you can see another AT ST
If you're good you can nail it with the rail gun now you will have to fight it later so you might as well
Behind the crates in the cargo area with the first AT ST is a grate
Slash it and follow it up
Eventually you will drop down into an area with a fan
Go through it keeping an eye on your health
You will pass through another fan then drop into an area with some Troopers with rail guns and the AT ST if you didn't pick it off earlier
Blow them up then head toward the shuttle
The Usual Suspects ofStorm Troopers plus Sentries Those annoying floating robots
Take them out with the Bryar or Blas Tech the two accurate weapons
Probe Droid Troublesome but not too dangerous
You just have to keep your distance when they self destruct
Torture Droid Our old buddies fromDark Forces back again
They're not as dangerous as before though they do more damage than the Sentries
They're fairly slow and can be dealt with easily with a Trooper Rifle
Level Walkthrough Exit the cavern to the left of the shuttle cockpit
You will enter a long mostly straight cavern
One way will give you a high view of the Imperial Fortress
Don't shoot don't snipe just ignore it for for now
Head down the tunnel in the opposite direction
You will come to a small structure in the cavern
Kill the Troopers around it
Inside is an Imperial Officer
Shoot him then shoot the panel just above the control banks to open the door
Go inside
Make sure you get the Sniper Scope this essential to level completion
SECRET Through the pillar with a door shaped hole
You will follow a small corridor then drop into what seems to be a dead end pit
If you turn around and turn on your light or Force Sight you can see a hole
Crouch and then collect a whole pile of goodies
Note Although they are not secrets there are lots of good items on the top of the pillar and the small control shed
The top of the shed has seeking rockets for the rail gun which are VERY useful
Exit through the triangular passageway in the room with the control shed
Follow the passage until you come to a large open area
You will see three Storm Troopers chatting in the distance
Good time to try out your new sniper rifle
Also a good time to try out seeking rockets for that AT ST hidden around the corner
Follow the rock bridge and the tunnel beyond you will soon get a view of the Imperial Fortress
Use the Sniper Rifle to destroy everything you can possible see before going down
Use the mouse to move the cross hairs that's easiest
In the far lower right of the fortress is a door
Once you have all cameras and defenses cleared away you will find approaching the door will make it close
The only way to enter is to retreat a distance until it opens
Then use the Sniper Rifle to shoot a panel just inside the door
Once it's destroyed you will be able to approach
SECRET Once up and on the Imperial Fortress follow the catwalk to the other side
Force jump onto the roof of the last structure
Notice the hole in the cavern wall
Force Jump into that
Now use Force Sight or some other lighting
Follow the short tunnel to an enormous drop
There is a ledge just below you
CAREFULLY drop to it to get the secret
You will need to Force Jump back to the tunnel above
NOTE THIS IS A TRICKY SECRET SO DO LOTS OF SAVING
Now return to the interior of the Fortress
Eventually you will come to a huge open area with a very fatal drop
From the ledge were you encounter a probe droid you must run Force Jump to the ledge on the opposite side
Might I advise you save before trying
On this new side find a metal staircase in the rocky cavern
At the bottom is a locked door protected by two Troopers
At the top is a passageway that leads to a TIE Fighter prep area
Kill 'em all why not use the blaster cannon to the left of the entrance Then go up the elevator
In the small L Corridor near the AT AT kill a Trooper then grab the key
Note that when you exit back up to the prep area lots of reinforcements arrive
Head back down to the locked door
You can go through it now
Take an elevator alcove to a small niche in the cavern
Across it an auto cannon will fire at you
A force field protects it from you
What you need to do is to stand to the far right of the niche
The cannon will try to track you and fire on those fuel barrels in the process
Once that blows so does the cannon and the force field drops
SECRET The fuel barrel explosion will also set the elevator in motion
You will need to make the tricky jump to this elevator
To the lower right of the elevator's lowest stop is a cavern with some items
This is the secret
You will need to save often in order to get through this part
NOTE You can blow up the fuel barrel on the elevator if you need more room
Take the elevator to the area where the cannon used to be
SECRET The secret is more difficult than most because it involves two actions triggering a console panel in one place which opens a sealed floor ceiling entrance in another part of the Fortress and then backtracking within the Fortress to the floor level above to that previously explored area
Walk through as follows Off to one side from the Auto cannon room is a series of small rooms the front room of which has a camera console panel the back mini rooms having pesky Probe Droids
Between the Camera Console Room and the Probe Droid mini rooms is a lone pedestal in an alcove
Push on the lone pedestal in that alcove and Kyle will say something to the effect of quot Hmmm
I wonder what that did quot You have now triggered the floor panel to open in another part of the Fortress actually on the floor above where you currently are
Now you just have to backtrack to get the secret
Now to backtrack
You need to get to the floor above in the Fortress easiest way is back outside the Fortress and back in through the side door you first used to access the Fortress and back up that side elevator if you left the elevator down otherwise some pain in the neck jumping in the main cavern to work your way back up to above floor may be in order
Once upstairs go into the interior of the Fortress the first main rough rocky room Room with two triangular quot nose cone quot kind of things sticking out from the walls that has a small finished quot supply room quot off to the side
Don't go forward toward the opening to the main cavern but go to the rough rocky passage that is to the left next to the small quot supply room quot Once you enter the rock passage the newly opened floor panel yawns in front of you
Hop in and the secret is yours
After getting Secret get back to the room that had been protected by the force field
To the left of where the fuel barrels used to be is a button
Press the button to summon the air car
Kill the troops inside then jump to it
If you crouch and hit the space bar this will lower the car to the cavern floor
SECRET Another tricky one
Just before the car touches down there is a ledge with lots of rockets on it
You will need to jump to it
Force Sight IR Goggles or something must be active before you can see it
SECRET Beyond the funny looking building is a tunnel frame it's part of the asteroid's weapon
Follow this tunnel from below
You will drop off a ledge have a light
To the right of this ledge as you drop is another ledge to drop to with a revive
Be careful you don't go too far or fast or into the abyss you go
Go through the tunnel just in front of the air car to end the level
What you've seen previously plus Assassin Droids Quick accurate shots from this droid make it very dangerous
It explodes when destroyed so you've got to take it down from a distance
We recommend the Repeater rifle for close encounters and the scope for distances then again we recommend the scope for all distances
Level Walkthrough Drop down to the pipe below killing all Troopers in site
Notice the area off to the side
Go into that area Notice a small box actually an elevator up
Go up
Kill all the rail gun toting Troopers in this new area
Go to the structure but find that the door on the side is locked
Never mind we'll be back later
Drop back down the elevator shaft
Now get back on the huge pipe and run down the pipe towards the hatch
It will open revealing an auto cannon
Use your saber to reflect shots back into it until it is destroyed then drop through the hole on the tube surface
Follow the tunnel then a metal quot road quot to a large platform
The platform will descend
At the bottom you will notice a control room off to the side
Enter the control room and blast them all
Notice the switches on on the dash before the window
The one closest to the monitor calls the elevator
The one closest to the door opens the big blast door in the corridor outside
Go into the new cubical control room
Blast them all
On the top level of this room on one of the control banks is a switch
Press it
Notice that grate under the ramp Cut it open and go in
Blast a probe droid and take the elevator up
In this little alcove is a small grille
Slash it and watch out for the auto cannon that appears
Now go back down the elevator
Notice the switch on the wall formerly protected by a hatch
Press it
SECRET Go back to cubical room
If you followed the instructions above a door at the top should now be open the level's only secret
Now go back up the elevator and follow the long road back into the tunnel
A blast door that was previously sealed is now raised
You will notice a wall of controls
Flip the switch on the right to switch targets
Press the button on the left to fire
Not enough power
Get the red key and exit the chamber then Force Jump through the hole in the ceiling in the corridor outside
Rush back into the area with crates and the little elevator
Go up
The metal structure's door can now be opened
Go inside blast the troops and turn a switch on the dash in front of the fancy display
Head back to the firing room
Make sure you've got the right target then fire
After you destroy the final cooling system unit a countdown will begin
You will have a VERY short amount of time to get out of Dodge
Don't waste time doing anything but getting out of there don't stop to fight or sightsee
When it comes to fighting conserve a few seeking rockets for the quick and easy kill
You don't have time for extended battles
If you don't have any run by and ignore your enemies
There are two secrets on this level both found before the countdown begins
Since you will be assuming the role of Mara Jade in the next missions it is inconsequential whether you find them or not unless you need some health and ammo
Normally you would conserve Bacta tanks and ammo for use on the next level but this is it for Kyle this time out
Don't be afraid to quot burn out quot the character in getting out of the level
SECRET Go through the control room door
Turn around and force jump to the top of the building you just exited
Now drop down to the ledge beneath the catwalk watching out for enemies
Jump to the weapon tunnel and follow it to what was quot the source quot of the weapon's energy
There's a grate there you can slash open with your lightsaber
Shortly after this you will enter a cavern with a metal hatch on the floor
Ignore the hatch for now
Go up the rocky staircase through a small tunnel
You will soon end up in a room with what looks like a concrete box and two Storm Troopers
This is the cooling unit
On the back of this box is a panel
Slash the panel with your lightsaber to destroy it
You will hear a warning but don't panic yet
Return to the room with the hatch on the floor
It's now open drop down on to a metal support
Follow the support down to a door
You will enter a chamber flooded with water
There are troopers around here but they can easily be picked off from underwater they won't see you submerged
Go to the rear of the chamber and you will find an entrance to the structure in the center of the room Watch out for the cannon
SECRET After destroying the cannon Force Jump to the catwalk on top you will probably need to do this from the water
On top is a Revive
Now go to the bottom of this new chamber
There is a hatch with four switches around it
These switches must be flipped rapidly and in order
Let's assume switch one is the one you would face if you had the chamber entrance BEHIND you
Moving clockwise to your right and the right of the chamber entrance is switch two
Behind you is switch three and to your left switch four
The correct order to hit the switches is
You may need Force Speed to assist you
After all four switches are activated resurface for air but keep a close eye on the hatch at the bottom
When you see the hatch begin to descend start counting quot Mississippi quot s At Mississippi the hatch will have descended far enough to admit you into the new chamber
It will start to rise again soon after this and you'll have to do the lever thing all over again if you don't swim fast enough Use Force Speed to swim down the tunnel
The first little quot dome quot in this new tunnel has an air pocket
Surface here and save your game
Now all the remaining cooling units are here four in all
Do not make the mistake I made and destroy the closest ones first
Travel to the furthest ones from your air pocket and slash them with the lightsaber first the panels are on top
The one immediately in front of your pocket save for last
After you've destroyed three of four go back to the air pocket and save the game
Now swim down and slash the remaining cooling module
Alarms will go off
A hatch in the floor around the corner to the left will open
Use Force Speed to swim down it
Once you are the bottom hug the floor as you swim to go through an opening into a new area
Just past this opening is an air pocket you may want to resurface for some air quickly
Now swim through this new area underneath a huge hatch remember it because you will be returning to it soon
You will swim into a large wide open area
Surface and get attacked by three Troopers
Kill them quickly Repeater Rifle works well
Now there are two control rooms in here
You must flip the two switches within second of each other
Once you have drop down into the water and swim to the large metal hatch you passed earlier
It should now be opening
Surface through here and run across the air car
A killer droid will be there destroy it extra fast or ignore it
Run down to the ledge where the Storm Trooper is
Kill him even faster or ignore him
Now turn and walk under the ledge you just dropped from sticking to the right
You will drop down a series of stone steps where another killer droid is
Kill him quick then run down the ledge with the beams
You will see a pit with a catwalk below
Drop down to it
It's going to hurt but it doesn't matter at this point
Take some Bacta tanks before you drop to assure the fall won't kill you or drop to some of the ledges on the way down if you have the time
Once on the catwalk below there are four switches
Press them all in any order but do it quickly
An air car will start to descend
Stand to the side to make sure it doesn't sandwich you
One it's down Force Jump on to it
It will start to ascend
Enjoy the ride up to the end of the level
If you are seriously pressed for time as the car slowly ascends hold down the Force Jump key and take one massive leap straight up
Sometimes this can trigger the end of the level
Familiar faces likeRodians Gamorreans and Grans
You'll also fightWeequays which are generally no tougher than pirates or Storm Troopers
The tricky thing here is that not everyone wants to kill you
You can walk by many creatures and not get a scratch
However kill one non hostile or even defend yourself against something that is hostile suddenly everyone wants to kick your butt
When entering a new area have your lightsaber ready to deflect shots
Just stand there to see who's hostile and who isn't
Be prepared to back out in a hurry
Once something starts watch out for quot friendlies quot you may have passed earlier
They may have had a change of heart and now your back's to them Force Jump to the ledge to the right of the door
Follow the cavern to the end
You will need to Force Jump on occasion to get where you want particularly at the end of the cavern which requires you to make a jump to a platform just outside the palace entrance
See that weird machine
Whack it repeatedly with your lightsaber inside and out
When those two pumps stop moving an ugnaut will come through the door to repair it
Go through the door
Follow the corridor until you come to the living quarters
Inside one is a shelf
You can crouch and crawl underneath the shelf to a second set of living quarters
Drop down to the lowest area of this new set of living quarters
Follow the corridor clear the chamber of Grave Tuskens
Just past a little stream is a set of Grave Tusken garb this will come in handy shortly
Return to the second set of living quarters and travel to the top level
You can raid the other rooms for supplies if you like
One of the rooms on the top level has a small sliding door that leads to a new area
Just beyond this a door like the main entrance only smaller
From your inventory select the Grave Tusken clothes use and to shuffle through inventory and enter to use
This will give Mara Jade a new look one the residents will find more attractive
Once attired get in front the box and hit the space bar
A mechanical eye will check you out then open the door
The door will not open if Mara is not disguised
Inside the new area go up a ramp
Two rooms at the top will open the main door if you want and smaller door at the end of the corridor on the right
It is the last door you want to take
Follow this corridor until you come to the living quarters of some Ithorians
In a small closet like room is a sliding door that will open onto a window ledge
SECRET At the Ithorian quarters open the sliding door and walk out to the ledge
Walk across the gap to the window ledge on the other side but don't open the window
Save the game
The window ledge to your left below can be jumped to barely
Open the sliding door to find an Ithorian in a secret room
Return to the ledge above the secret on that wall and go into some new Ithorian quarters
Go through them to a balcony and jump into the alley below
Watch out for Tuskens
Soon you'll come to a third set of living quarters
Kill the nearby Grans
SECRET The next multi leveled walkway area immediately after the ledges has a room where there is a Rodian or two inside
On the wall to the right of the doorway is a hole that you can crawl through to get some stuff
Be aware of another Rodian inside it
Now go back outside and then drop to the lowest level
You'll see a flooded tunnel
Go down it
Soon you'll swim through a crack in the floor and re emerge into a new area
Your Tusken disguise will vanish but don't worry about it
Climb up the ramp in this new area
You'll see a platform with some Gamorreans kill 'em and some ugnauts
There's a grille on the floor here slash it and drop through
SECRET Follow the tunnel into you reach a rock again
As you enter this cave there is a platform to your right
Jump to it
Once on it turn around and jump into a cavern with the collapsed well textures
The passage to the left contains some much needed items
Drop through the hole that over looks the water to get back on the beaten path
Jump back to the platform with the ugnauts
Go through the door
You are now in the ugnaut quarters
At the back is a hatch leading to what's kind of like a dumbwaiter
Get into it and go up
Soon you will come to a bridge over some stairs
Drop down and starts descending all the stairs you can find
Eventually you find yourself down in a corridor traveling past some booths where ugnauts drink
Go through this door
You will see another door and a small alcove with a winding staircase
Go up the stairs and hit the switch at the top
The other door below is now open go through it
You come to a room with a red key
The red key opens the door to a room full of useful stuff
Retrace your steps to that bridge you dropped down and continue along it
You will come to a bar full of patrons who may turn nasty at any moment
Travel down a ramp and through a door to the left into a prison area
Around the corner is two buttons
The one closest to the cell opens all the cells
The other activates a staircase
Open the cells if you want just watch out for the ungrateful Gran
There's a health pack in his cell
Go up the stairs
There is a switch in the room to the right of the door
Below this chamber is a large rising column that you will need to hitch a ride on
Hit the switch twice to put the column into place and rush downstairs not into the cell area
and jump on top of the brick
The column will take you to a level with lots of grates in the floor
Slash the upper left most and drop through
Fight of the Gamorreans and drop into the lower part of the level with the Grans and Rodians
Kill them then follow the passage here down to a storage room with a heavy explosive
Return to area you dropped down from and then go upstairs onto the rough
You will see a jeweled dome
Use the heavy explosive on top of the dome
This level presents an interesting challenge
Your mission is to prevent Abron Mar from escaping in his ship
This level has lots ofStorm Troopersandpirates
The Storm Troopers will not attack you if you don't disturb the peace
You can even defend yourself against attackers and unless a stray shot gets too close to someone they'll leave you alone
The biggest foes arepirates and Grans They are most likely to attack
There are no secrets on this level but there are many hidden stashes of items
We noted a few of the less obvious ones
Generally speaking if you see a ledge you can Force Jump to do it there's something there
Your first order of business make sure Abron Mar can't leave
Walk around the city watching for Grans in high places with detonators
You will probably soon find the bar where Mar hangs out
DO NOT ENTER YET
Instead find the other bar like room
There are three doors that lead to it
Go inside where you will be attacked by pirates
There is a Blue Wrench in here you will need to stop Mar from leaving
Pick it up
You can Force Jump through holes in the ceiling and find an area with some supplies
Be warned reinforcements will come through the doors of this area and can surprise you as you jump back down
Now that you have the Wrench you've got to find Mar's ship
It's actually not far from where Mara parked and it's in a similar landing bay
Enter the bay kill pirates as you go
There's an R Starchaser here Abron Mar's ship
Beyond this is a door
Go inside and you will find a switch
If you have the Wrench hitting the space bar will turn it causing the hangar doors to close and completing a mission objective
On the way out of this area beware of a squad of hostile Storm Troopers
Time to meet Mar
Go to the bar
It's up a flight of stairs
A Grave Tusken is passed out in an alcove next to it
Civilians have a habit of congregating here blocking your way
If so fire a shot at the wall and back out
They should panic enough to run
Or if you're more inclined to the Dark Side kill 'em
Before you visit the bar you may want to visit the little shop next door
Behind the counter is a rifle scope which is very very handy
Okay inside the bar
There's an area in the bar where Mar is hanging out
If you just peek around the corner you can use the scope to pick off his bodyguards
DO NOT SHOOT MAR
After his bodyguards are dead enter the room
An in game cut scene will show him running away
When control is returned to you go after him
He will escape through a hatch you cannot open
Don't worry
Turn around and go back out through the bar
Watch out for Storm Troopers in the bar
At this point if they don't hate your guts already they will now
Now amble on over to the triangular wall
Behind these passageways is a door you couldn't open before
The door is open now
Again peek around the corner and use the scope to blast his mates
Don't shoot Mar himself
After his buds are toast go inside the room where another in game scene will show him escaping
No problem
See those tubes in the corner of the room
Use them hit the spacebar and they will go together
Now enter the control room and see two levers
Hit one and then the other
The air car will crash through them ending the level
Again there are no secrets but here's one that might have been jump through this yellow wall to find some items if you happen to come by this room
This level doesn't have as much fighting as other levels and if you're careful you shouldn't get roughed up too badly
TheTrandoshansare back with a Concussion rifle
SECRET To the left of the crash is a dwelling
Enter the dwelling and look under the ramp
You'll have to push past some civilians to collect the items
SECRET At the crash site go right to the stairway
Above from a balcony where the Gran throws the T Detonators Kill him and Force Jump onto the balcony it's lit with purple amp red lights
Follow the city streets an you will come across a hostile Trandoshan
Kill him and enter a strange hanger like area with what look like reversed ramps against the walls
Behind one is a grate
Slash 'n enter
You will come to a partially flooded hallway
Force jump to the platforms above
Follow the ledge around the buildings until you come to another wide open area
Drop to city floor
Traveling along you will come to an area with quot traffic gates quot Mara will complain that they're closed
SECRET Just before Mara talks about the traffic gates being cut off there is a long hallway you have to go through that has a big arched ceiling
You open the door and enter the courtyard where the traffic gates are and immediately turn left
There is a small bar
Before you walk into it Force jump onto the space next to the wall above
There is a grate
Slash through it and enter the secret area
Say hi to the ugnaut while you're in there
Leap up on to the balcony to the left of the traffic gates
You will go through a private dwelling
SECRET Inside the apartment building that you go through to circumnavigate the traffic gate be sure to quot activate quot the beds
Under one is yet another secret
Look out of the window of this apartment and find enemies who will attempt to force you to eat rockets
Kill 'em and drop down
SECRET After dropping down to the street Force Jump to the ledge directly across from the balcony
Open the door and go down into a private dwelling
SECRET When you leave the dwelling by the side door with the jagged top look up
There is enough room to force jump up to a ledge
It contains a baddie with a bacta tank and some energy
you may want to send a concussion blast or grenade up first
Explore the various hangars on this street maybe almost bump into someone you know
You will come to one with an air car
This air car can boost you to the ledge in this area which has a grate you need to go through
You can ascend this way after hitting a nearby switch it is also possible to Force Jump to it
Go through the grate and out on to the rooftops
SECRET When you come to the rooftops from the air car hangar you will see a rounded roof
Walk to the other side for a backpack
Look over the ledge
You will see a group of Storm Troopers
Pick them off then drop down via the canopies
SECRET From here follow the street to find an odd shaped door
Go in and kill three Grans
Just above them is a fan
Force Jump through the fan
SECRET Well once you drop off this ledge that you are on in the above secrets picture there's an opening that leads to the ground floor of the hotel
Inside there's a staircase leading to the second floor
Underneath the staircase is one of the secrets giving you a health pack and bacta tank
SECRET At the end of this street Force Jump through the arch
SECRET Then Force Jump on the ledge where the Gran was
Run across the bridge hanging two lefts
Watch out for a mine around the corner of this last turn
There are two doors in this area but concentrate on the room above the street
Careful use of the scope can take care of the bad guys inside
Now go to the two doors
Try the door on the left
Just inside is a mine
Use a thermal detonator to blow it up
Run up these stairs and grab the blue key
Now run back down and try the other door
Blast the Trandoshan inside and then open another door
There's Abron Mar
You've got him right where you want him
Well not quite You start the level unarmed
You'll get your saber back shortly but the rest of the way you'll be scavenging for equipment
When you get a Blaster again don't go nuts
You will need to conserve ammo
Expect the usual assortment of cantina rejects to oppose you
Caught in a prison cell how to escape
Use Force Pull on the passing Gammorrean to steal his key
Quickly use it to get out of the cell
Naturally you have no weapons
You can beat the two Gamorreans to death with your fists but it's safer to avoid them
You can release prisoners who will attack the guards but are more likely to attack you
It is possible to avoid the slow Gamorreans
In one unoccupied cell there is a Pry bar
Go in and get it
In another cell the back wall is exposed and leads to a sewage pipe
The pipe is cracked open
Above the pipe is a small alcove with a switch
Use the Prybar on it then drop down into the pipe to continue on
Go down the submerged tunnel
You will come to two different tunnels go up the first one
When you surface get ready for a fight
An in game cut scene will introduce you to the Rancor
When you're back in control run around the corner up the little stream
A barred gate will clock your way
Beyond the gate however is your saber
Use Force Pull
Now fight the Rancor but don't get too close or it's snack time
SECRET Once the Rancor is defeated go back down the water tunnel
Turn left towards the tunnel you ignored earlier
At the end of that second tunnel is grate you can now destroy thanks to your lightsaber
Go back to the Rancor area
Now that the monster is dead the metal gate is raised
Follow this new tunnel until you reach a large corridor
There is a door with a power droid in front of it
Go through this door
Kill the guard in this room then go through another door
Walk over the conveyer belt and grab the droid arm in the corner of the room
SECRET Under the conveyer belt you will find a grille
Slash and drop down
Back in the corridor where you saw the Power Droid go into the other door
Looks like hangar of some kind
The upper level of this room holds a door but it's locked
Kill the baddies and move on to the room beyond with a second door on the lower level
Now you're in a similar area with an air car moored over water
SECRET As you enter the area look up at the girders at the end of the room
See that little gap
Jump into it
Go through a door on the lower level
Follow a staircase up to a control room and hit the switch
This will open up the door of the first hangar you passed through
Return to the hangar and go outside the open doors to the left
Soon you will find yourself climbing into a little canyon
There's an entrance here too locked
Climb over the entrance and enter through a grille on the reverse side
Inside this room is the GCT device
Grab it
Exit this room via the door that leads to the hangar
Go out into the large corridor
A blast door that was previously sealed is now open
Use Force Jump to get across the room full of electrified water
SECRET In the corridor on the other side of the electrified water there is a room with a catwalk above
Blow up the fuel canisters to reveal the entrance to the secret
There's another room in this area with three switches
Hit the middle switch and the switch on the right only then turn and go back to the water
Dive in and swim to an underground cavern
Resurface on the other side then run to your ride at the dock
Piratesaren't very different fromTroopers
There are a number of environmental hazards Force Fieldsandbooby trapped doors to be specific
There's also the occasionalstray bolt of lightning
Head down to the lower level where the X Wings are
Against one wall you will see a window and a door
There is a switch inside which can be pulled by the Force
Use Force pull and the X Wings will take off
A huge elevator will raise exposing a grille underneath
Slash it and go through
You will soon find yourself in a corridor
SECRET At one end of the corridor is a turret
There's a switch around the corner press it
Now look at the base of the turret and hit the spacebar
Have fun firing the gun
At the other end of the corridor is a tunnel flooded with blue light and dead soldiers floating
Gravity has failed
Use the Jump key to ascend the tunnel
Shortly you will pass through an area that appears to be under the floor
There are holes near the ceiling supports to go through
Pass through another area like this and take an elevator up
You should soon find yourself in the medical bay use the medical droid if injured
There's a set of double doors here ignore for now
Go through the breach in the wall instead
Take an escalator elevator up to a control room
Kill all the pirates then shatter the glass if not already smashed
Go inside and take the key from the dead officer
Head back to the medical bay having first flipped the switch to order the evacuation the panel on the wall protected by a force field
The double doors of the medical bay are open
Go through another set of double doors at take one of the elevators at the end of the corridor up
You'll soon witness an escape corridor collapse
Mara comments that she must reconnect it
But let's grab the secret first
SECRET Jump on the tube and walk to the end where the Alliance soldiers are
Once on the other side turn around and slash a metal pole supporting the tube
Now drop down into the tube
Walk to the end of the tunnel
Be very careful in this highly hazardous area and don't spend a second longer in here than you have to
Now retrace your steps to the other side
Slash the remaining pole on top with the lightsaber
Go back to the area with the Alliance soldiers but do it quickly
Stray electricity makes this area deadly
Clear the area of pirates then find the door with the blasted panel
Next to this is a switch that Mara can't use
SECRET Try to use the panel anyway
Now fly around the corner to a small door
An R unit will come out of the door
You must get in quickly before the door closes there's a panel on the side to open the door from the inside
Now crouch down beside the R unit and hit the spacebar to use it
The R unit will go around the corner and open the door for you
SECRET Right after the third secret where you go into the R unit's hiding place there is a secret to the right of the door
It is a similar little compartment to the R 's one
You need to push the R in front of the door then use space bar to activate the door
It may work without pushing him up to it
Go through the door the R unit opened and come to two elevators
Ascending in these elevators takes you near enough to a live mine to detonate it
Be sure to run clear before it blows
Ignore the two booby trapped doors and go into the area with the crates
Jump to the top of the crates
The pirates will start transporting them to their ships
Jump back down or you will carried into the force field
SECRET Using Force Sight or some other illumination you can see a control booth in this area
The glass is smashable
Before you go in throw something explosive inside to trigger the mines inside
Now back in the area where the crates were take an elevator up
In there area where the Jedi Holocron used to be you will notice several grates in the wall
We found that the easiest thing to do to get the two secrets is this SECRET Find the grate that is partially blocked by two crates
Notice you can push the crates out of the way
There is also a single crate in here push that against the pillar that contains the grate
Slash it open and go inside to receive credit for a secret
SECRET Now that you're inside this new tunnel Force Jump straight up
You will find yourself in a shaft connected to all the grates that lead into the tunnel
There's a temporary invincibility power up here
Now follow the tunnel down until you come to a grate at the lowest part of the level
Cut it open and drop down
Flip all the switches in the two control rooms and the door to the core will open
Go inside
You will be on a catwalk
At the end of one of the catwalk paths is a circular grate
Cut it and go in
Kill the pirates in the zero gravity room
You will see a control room
Underneath it is a grille
Cut it to gain access to an elevator shaft
Descend the shaft
In this new area is an open crate
You need to get into this before it closes
Don't waste too much time fighting everyone
Get inside the crate and get smuggled to the next level Hey didn't Katarn try this once too
Watch out for flying construction bots the pirate equivalent of sentries
Other than that nothing out of the ordinary
There are items on top of the large crates in the area you begin in
Go into the next room and hit the switch on the wall
In the next room you will notice a blue switch that must be turned by a blue wrench
Ignore it for now and drop down to the next area
Before you enter the red area there are two switch on the wall between the doorways one on either side
Hit them both then run quickly across
On the other side kill the loader bot and take the Blue Wrench
SECRET On the platform with the loader bot turn to the left
There's a wall you can destroy
Shoot it out and go inside
Before re crossing back to the other side hit two more switches in this area
You should now be able to float across safely
Go back to the Blue Switch and turn it now that you have the wrench
A hatch will open
SAVE THE GAME
Now you must ascend to another hatch inside the this tunnel and you don't have a second to waste or Mara will die
The best thing to do is look up and hit the X jump key to go there quickly
Open the hatch go through and save again
It will probably take you a few attempt to do it
You will follow a relatively straightforward path
Eventually you will enter a circular room which requires you to jump to a platform above
On this platform is another hatch opened by the Blue Wrench
Go through it
The other hatch is just across the way and not nearly as hard to get to as the first
SECRET On the other side of the hatch you will see an armored vest across a gap
Jump to it
Now drop down into the room below
Kill the loader bot and take the yellow key
In the control room next to this there are two yellow switch on the floor
Hit them and drop on the conveyer belt
Have your saber ready
Follow the conveyor belts noting that they all end at a force field
You must drop to lower levels to avoid them
Eventually you will wind up at the bottom of a small shaft
Walk down the corridor watching out for electricity and Construction bots
SECRET After the tunnel full of electricity you will enter a square but pitch black room
I you hit your automap you will see four smaller squares in this room
Look up
Those holes are those squares
Force Jump through
Walk around this new area to get credit for the secret
SECRET After the third secret Jump back down STOP at hole in the floor
Disable both of the two red power vents with the lightsaber on the walls to your right and left
Now you can drop down the hole
Switches on the ceiling will propel you back up or you can Force Jump
Reach the end of this corridor then jump
Shoot like crazy
You will be an odd new area full of pirates an floating robots kill them all then find the door out of this area
This door will not open as long as the two cameras in the area are active
Destroy them both and the door will open
In the next room there's an stationary cannon
When you approach one of the room exits the door will open and pirates will pour in
Run back to the cannon and waste them all you don't have to kill them this way but it's fun
When they're dead go through the door next to the one you came through
You'll soon find yourself at the end of the level
Noghri Watch for their ability to make suddenly lunges and unexpected jumps
Another creature you best kill from a distance if possible
A rapid fire weapon like the Repeater is ideal for close quarters
If you are in close take advantage of their initial slowness to react with some swift lightsaber strokes
Go into the area with the fountain
One branch from here leads to a bar where you will be recognized
If you don't go in here you can save yourself a little trouble
There's not much to collect in here anyway
Go up the huge staircase
You will cross over a bridge
Note the two balconies over looking the bridge
These aren't secrets but there are many items in them
Soon you will come to a road with a river pouring over a cliff and lots of huge doors
Open one of the doors to enter the market area
Clear out the bad guys then jump onto the roofs
You will find an area up here that contains a pillar
Jump to it
If you just walk off the ledge the reduced gravity should be sufficient to get you there
Now jump of the pillar on to the new path
Go around the pillar and hit a switch before continuing on
Follow the black catwalk
You will soon drop down to a new walkway where wind tunnel attempt to blow you right out of the building
Now would be a good time to save
SECRET This one is a pain so save first
In the hall with the black catwalk with the wind tunnels save right before the second set of tunnels
Pull your lightsaber hit force speed and wait until the wind blast just starts to die down
Run full speed into the left tunnel where the air source is run forward and slash the grate
Step in and jump into an alcove on the left before the next blast of air
Congrats you've found the secret
If you do get blown out there is a grille in one corner of the pool you land in
Slash it and get sucked down
It takes you where you eventually want to go anyway
Whatever way you go you will soon wind up in a room full of rushing water and levers
The first lever you pull will raise a set of cement blocks
Jump to them
Now use Force Pull to flip the next lever
As the next set of blocks rise the ones you stand on will lower
It is a good idea to jump jest before the new blocks appear
Repeat this process until you are on the other side
On the other side go through a door and see a grille
Cut it open and flood the room
Swim through
SECRET Kill all the drugons
Take a deep breath
Swim down along the corner where you entered the aquarium
Once you reach the bottom swim to the right and around a small corner
You will find another grate
Cut it open and swim through
You will find a room with a revive and a few other powerups
Now swim to the top of the structure
On top is a grille cut and enter
Down this corridor you will Kaerobani's museum How to get to the Holocron
In one of these rooms is a small rectangular pool
At the bottom of this pool is a grille
I think you know what to do by now
Water will suck you down
When you can control you direction again take a tunnel down
You will emerge through a waterfall
Follow this new tunnel to a bulkhead door
Flip the switch and go through
Quickly
You are now in the area below the Holocron
Force Jump up to the platform
Whoa
The platform just dropped you into a pool of water
Kill the knife wielding guys and escape down the corridor
Fairly linear from here
Eventually you take a large elevator up looking out for pirates with rail guns
Soon you will be back in the area with the where you entered the market near the beginning of the level
Go back to the landing area and go into the area with the large conveyer belt
Follow the conveyer belt until you reach a wide open area full of crates
A catwalk is above this room jump to it
Follow it to an exit
You'll find a circular chamber guarded by pirates
Kill them and take the stairs down or simply drop down
Go to the bulkhead doors hit the switch beside them and make your escape
Dianogas You will miss the merry days ofDark ForcesandShadows of the Empirewhen you could use good ol' sidearms to blow Dianogas away
You can only engage them in the water using your saber here for reasons that will become clear shortly after you begin the level
The trick to fighting Dianogas is to give yourself some room
When they get into swinging distance swing once then retreat
Let it come to you
If you can possibly avoiding fighting one do it
Swamp Wampas Two good shots from their mighty paws and it's goodbye cruel world
Like the Dianogas give them plenty of space let them come to you and walk into a swing then back up
Maillocs Hah
Lots of these but they're the least of your worries
Try not to get surrounded they tend to attack in numbers
An extended swing the Z key swing can take care of a bunch if you're turning while you swing your saber
Remember they need a second to wind up their tales before they can inflict damage giving you a chance to strike
Dart Vines These fire a kind of projectile
You can redirect it like a normal laser blast using your saber
It's also effective to sneak up on them using Persuasion
Ysalamiri These creatures negate the Force within a meter radius
While they won't damage Mara it's somewhat embarrassing to have your invisibility stripped away while you're sneaking up on some Wampas just because you passed one on the way
Just make sure that you're not near one at a critical moment
You can tell if you are by a bird like chirping
Ysalamiri can be pushed out of the way by kneeling and walking into them
Sinkholes There are strong water currents in the swamp that will pull you into vertical tunnels
Using Force Sight and the map mode you can spot them easily
If you do get caught in one use Force Speed to swim out
Oh yeah one last piffling little detail
None of your weapons except for your saber are working
Use Force Persuasion to get by the statue as you begin the level
SECRET Just past the first sinkhole you'll find a lone pillar branch thing
To the left of this is a tunnel leading to a shallow pool
Inside the pool is a dianoga
Kill it and collect the smuggler's pack at the bottom
SECRET Your first quot clearing quot will have a brownish crooked pillar a tree
in the center
To the right is the passage further into the level which has a small think vine handing from the corner
To the left is a slope which you can use Force speed or jump to climb
At the top is a plateau and secret number two
SECRET You will come to an area with several vines and some Mailocs
Kill them all the get on to the tree
Use it as a ramp combined with Force Speed and Jump to leap up to a ledge
There are actually two ledges but one has a Ysalamiri on it
You can get up enough speed to clear the first ledge but if you land on it you will need to push the Ysalamiri to one edge of the platform in order to Force jump up to the secret
Though it's not a secret this area has a branch on the far right which leads to a wampa cave
Kill the wampas and there are some more items for the taking
SECRET Taking the left path from the last secret you will enter another open valley
A large brown tree branch and a large green branch cross the valley
Force Jump to the brown one then Force Jump Speed to the brown one
Follow the brown one to the top for a Force surge and the secret
Move a long the path to find Kyle's shuttle
There's some goodies on the crate but also a live land mine
Soon after this you will reach an apparent dead end
You will see some statue under a rocky passage
Between the statues will be the carving of a evil looking face
Use Force Sight and then hit the space bar to flip this switch
A passage will open underwater
You'll be standing on it when you hit it and the hatch will slide you back
Swim down into the underwater cavern avoiding a dianoga
If you're in pretty good shape kill the dianoga for a reason which will soon become clear
After swimming through the tunnel you'll enter a kind of mini temple by a Dark version of Mara Jade
She's pretty tough
She'll use Blind Jump and especially Lightning on you
The best tactic for killing her is to use the water to your advantage
Fight her as you would a normal Dark Jedi but watch out for getting cornered in the confined spaces
Whenever you are injured and near death retreat to the water
Sometimes Dark Mara won't follow
Your mana can recuperate so you can use Healing if you have it
If Mara does find you here no problem
Jump into the water see why it's not a bad idea to kill that Dianoga now
Dark Mara will follow
DON'T FIGHT HER IN THE WATER
Instead jump back out and run up the stairs
She'll have problems maneuvering with the tight spacing and water to slow her down
This should give you some good attack openings
If necessary retreat back into the chamber
Don't fight Dark Mara in the tunnel between the water and the chamber
It's cramped and she'll rip you a new one in no time flat
There's Force surge power up in here use it wisely
Once Dark Mara is defeated drop down a passageway that opens up inside the chamber
SECRET Just after the fight with Mara you will come another flooded cave
Watch out for two knife wielding Noghri who may be in the water
Dispose of them and then swim down into the cavern
Slash a passage covered with vines
Inside this new tunnel is a Dianoga
On the floor of the tunnel is a pit leading to secret
SECRET After you emerge from the water you will jump over a rock face into another open area with Wampas and plenty of Mailocs
Kill them all then turn around and face the way you came into the clearing
Above the entrance to the cave is a platform with some goodies
Force Jump towards it
You may need Speed to give you extra power for the jump
SECRET Follow the passage along until you find it split by a rock face
The left passage has a small cavern with a much needed revive
Not long after this you will come to another dead end
A statue is nearby looking at the wall
Use Force Sight to look at the wall to expose the passageway
SECRET Now you will come to the last open area before the temple entrance
There's large pillar here and near that pillar is a ledge you can Force Jump to
Do so and find a Ysalamiri waiting on the ledge
There's another ledge above this one which you need Force Jump to get to but can't because of the Ysalamiri
By crouching and running into the creature you can push it
Push it out of the way on the right of the ledge the right assuming you're facing the wall
Move as far left as possible then Force Jump up
It may be possible to push the Ysalamiri off the ledge entirely but we haven't succeeded in doing this
From here it's a fairly routine trip to the Temple entrance and the end of the level
Vornskr This one gets my vote for the enemy you swear at most
Vornskr are vicious wolves that can rip you to confetti in seconds
A few tips on dealing with them very few Force powers work on them
The only one I could find in fact was Destruction
They can take about two hits with a lightsaber so use the Z swing
Personally I like charging them head on
If they come to you you're in big trouble
Oh yeah
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE ITS ABILITY TO LEAP
You think you're safe up on that ledge but trust me you ain't
You may have better luck with backing up and letting it leap into your lightsaber swing
Either way standing still is fatal
Follow the corridor to a door
The face to the right of the door is a switch but it cannot be activated until you look at it with Force Sight
By and by you will enter what looks like a great hall
SECRET Enter the structure with the triangular roof
Fight all the statues within
The room to the right of the entrance has a flooded crack
Go in and collect a revive
Return to the main hall to find another structure with a triangular roof
This one is flooded
Save the game before entering
Swim down the corridor and turn left there's an air pocket above you here if you need it
Swim into the little cavern below then hang a right
A room with another air pocket is coming up on your left
Follow a submerged staircase to find it
SECRET If you follow this tunnel all the way to the left you will find a ramp
Follow it and walk into the arena like room in front of you
there you will find the most accursed of all enemies THREE Vornskrs in three wall niches
Somehow survive the Vornskrs and in the niche on the left the wall at the back is just an illusion
Walk through it and you will find a revive
Use Force Sight
SECRET From your air pocket swim down to the wall with the three carvings
The middle one a face is a secret
Use Force Sight to see the entrance
Swim back to your air pocket
This next part is tricky
The carving at the end to left of the secret is the way you want to go
This carving actually it looks like this stone was left blank can be pushed hold down the spacebar
Don't try to do it in one trip
I recommend taking it in three stages going back to the air pocket so you don't drown
Force Speed will help you greatly here
Push the stone far enough and you can exit into a large flooded room
The exit is in the upper left corner
Resurface in a room with two killer statues and a water trough
At the end of the hallway from here is a door
Use Force Sight to see the switch
Enter a two tiered room with a Mailoc and a few of those knife wielding blue guys
Waste them and jump up to the second level
Follow the floor to a dead end
Jump up through a hole in the ceiling
This new corridor will take you along for awhile then you drop down through another hole
Drop into a pool and fight the statues
Notice that this room has a ledge you can jump to
There are items scattered around the ledge you an also hide up here if you need to
Leave this area to come to a corridor with four rooms attached
Kill the enemies hiding within
The last room on the left has a carving that is actually a switch
Use Force Sight to see and activate it
A door will open behind it
SECRET Now that you hit the switch go back into the hall
There was a small pool of water on the floor
If you tried to submerge here early you found you couldn't
But now that you've hit the switch you can
We strongly suggest you save the game at this point
Now go back into the room with the face switch and enter the door it revealed
An elevator will take you into the water
As soon as you hit the bottom use Force Speed to breeze down the tunnel
You will soon come to a room you can surface in
There are two Dianogas in this area get out of the water fast
Don't stay on that tiny ledge either
Sometimes they can get you there
Move into the corridor at the end
You may want to save again
SECRET Kill off those Dianogas be careful
There's a slashable grille in their little swimming pool
Cut it and go in
You'll soon be thrown into a pit of water where some items are hidden
The exit is a hatch just below the surface of the water
After you've gotten the secret move on from the Dianoga pool
Go across two rooms on a collection of cris crossing beams into a large purple hallway
Open the large gray door to complete the level
Sith Zombies These undead creatures fire Force Lightning
If you have Absorb they pose no threat whatsoever
If you don't use their lack of speed to your advantage
Get behind them and hit them hard
When facing you up close they can inflict a heap o' damage
Use your agility to keep ahead of them
Run down the corridor until you reach a room with water and two pillars
Force Jump to the top of the pillars and collect Bacta and Force boosts
Not a secret but you can use all the help you can get
You will reach a huge open chamber
This is the nexus of the level you'll be in and out of here a lot
For now let's take the door on the right of this platform as you enter
Drop down into a valley with killer kats and Mailocs
Be on your guard
SECRET When you drop into the valley directly across from you is a ledge on the opposite wall of the valley
Drop down onto the next ledge below you as if you were descending into the valley normally and then turn and force jump over onto this other side of the valley
Make your way up that ledge as the ceiling gets lower and lower
At the end is a hole up into a cavern
Force jump up there to get the secret and a backpack
On the other side of this valley is a small ramp leading to a cave entrance
Go in
You'll soon jump through a hole in the ceiling into another cavern and fight off a Vornskr
You'll find yourself in another open cavern fending off Mailocs and a Vornskr
Follow a side path up the valley and into a temple corridor
There is a button here press it
Finding these buttons is the major focus for much of this level
Now go through the triangular door at the end of the hallway
Fight off two statues then jump into the pool
Descend until you emerge from a waterfall
Fight off two more statues
Next your old teacher will appear to give you another lesson
Kyle is a pretty good fighter
He will use Persuasion Grip and Lightning
He almost always blocks the first thing you send at him so the trick is to have something else to follow your first shot quickly
The elongated swing Z keys is good for getting Kyle to commit to a block and then swinging around and hitting him in the back
Fighting with Force Speed is not a bad idea
You can also try to win the endurance race save your mana for Force Healing if you have it
Notice there a Force boosts in the corners of the room to give you an extra charge
Once you have inflicted enough damage on Kyle he will disappear in a blinding flash
A ledge previously protected by a force field is now open
SECRET After you beat Kyle the first time jump up to the ledge with the two statues
Drop down the Hole
Walk out then walk back to where you landed and back quickly to make floor go up have force seeing on and drop down and there's your secret
After a trip down a long corridor you will come to a set of chambers with two Vronskr prowling about
In one of the chambers is an upward current
Stand inside
You will be taken up to a room full of Dart Vines
Kill them and then go up the stairs
At the end of the hallway there's a button
Press it
Having done that retreat to the first hallway you passed when you went to press this button
Go down it and kill a Vornskr
At the end of this long corridor is a button
Press it and go out onto another platform in the central chamber with two statues on it this is just so you get your bearings
Now go back to the button and take the other hallway the one closest to it
You'll end up on a platform
You can't open the doors here but don't worry about that
Save your game and prepare for something really dangerous
Facing the wide open space in front of you you want to jump to the platform on your left
Yep jump
Specifically you want to get a running start with Force Speed and then Force Jump
It's pretty easy once you get used to it though expect to take some damage when you land
You will recognize this platform as the first one you encounter when you began the level
You went to the door on the right of the large doors when you started
Now you want to go down the hallway to the left of the door You'll know it because you'll go down some stairs and encounter a Vornskr
Follow this new tunnel to a small pool with Force boosts set in stone
Take one or two if you need them
SECRET Jump into the pool
You'll see a face carved on the bottom
Use Force Sight to reveal a passageway then go down
After you get the secret come back up and go down a tunnel on your right
When you emerge from this corridor go right an press a button
Notice through a gap in the wall you can see another chamber where Kyle stand in the middle
Follow this gap up the wall
You'll soon get some sage advice from Kyle
Soon you will come to a chamber with water three pillars and a door with a face on it
Go through this door
It's another large chamber with large columns
At one side of the chamber is a carpet leading to a small grove where an elevator lands
Destroy the statues then notice the buttons inside each pillar
Press each one and the elevator will arrive
Take it up
Follow the red carpet to the door and open it
You're now in the room you saw Kyle in
He's since vanished
Drop down the hole in the floor
At the bottom take either branch down to a long dark chamber
At the end of the corridor is a statue
Hmm approach it
This next part is no trouble whatever if you have Absorb
Activate it and then kill the undead warriors
They won't be able harm you
If you don't have Absorb run like the wind
You will need to carefully kill them one at a time frequently retreating to heal yourself
However you do it finish off the undead
The last coffin to the left of the chamber as you enter has a hole in it flooded
Go down it
Resurface in a corridor much like the ones you seen before
An undead warrior is here
Chop him up and then follow the corridor to a button
Press it
Now you have a choice of tunnels
Go down the one that leads to a flooded cavern
Down below is another tunnel
Get to that tunnel
Be warned that there is a Dianoga in the water
SECRET If you go into the water with the Dianoga there is a crack in the floor
If you go down it you can find a revive
Taking this new path you will be on the platform in the central area with the two statues
Things have changed now
There's new carvings on the wall and a new button
If you press space bar in front of the carvings you will change the carving
If you press a button it will either help you open the doors or it will fire lightning at you
If you have Absorb now's the time to have it active in case you make a mistake
Hit the carving on the right ONCE
Press the button
Doors should open but a Force field prevents you from entering
Now change the carvings again
This time the hooded guy left will be holding his saber in front of him while the bald guy has his saber down and his hand raised
Press the button
The doors will open a little more
Now change the carvings so that both guy have sabers raised over their heads
Press the button
Defeat the two statues why not send the flying with Force Push
Then take the elevator in front of the throne down
There's a button on the wall
Use Force Sight to see it and push it
A bridge will slowly stretch out to the platform in the middle of the chamber
Get on the platform and take it down
It's almost time for the final showdown
Kyle will appear and present you with an ultimatum
When he's finished turn your back to him and walk off the platform
quot There are alternatives to fighting quot Obi Wan Kenobi Kyle sure takes a beating doesn't he
I fought for close to a half hour before I realized what I was doing wrong
Kyle is not like Jerec or those other Dark Jedi creampuffs
You can't beat him in a fight
There's only one way to stop him and no amount of ammo or lightsaber attacks will do it
Run around the room and examine everything closely Notice the painting on the wall
Give you any ideas
Turn off your lightsaber
Stand beneath the portrait
Kyle doesn't have the heart to kill you if you won't fight

Jessica Plunkenstein amp The D sseldorf Conspiracy Walkthrough Len Green th August lengreen hotmail com PREFACE Read the Manual file for operating instructions etc
I have copied the lsquo Overview rsquo from the Manual with permission from Greg Edwards the game Developer It gives a very brief outline of the flavor of the game itsextreme humor amp erudition hellip and that isvery muchan understatement I rsquo m afraid that I can rsquo t in ANY WAY emulate that and so this walkthrough will be very dry and factual hellip my apologies in advance
OVERVIEW It rsquo s been a peculiar day for Jessica Plunkenstein
By a freak twist of fate and airline security she finds herself battling evil Barons bent on world domination evil headmistresses bent on pathological propriety and evil yodelers bent on nothing in particular
Full of llamas Ninjas French people pickled herring dubious German accents Yetis in heat and musical theatre up the wazoo Jessica rsquo s adventures bring her from the Amazonian Rain Forests to the Norwegian Alps with layovers along the Eastern seaboard
So tag along and with luck you too can unravel The D sseldorf Conspiracy
INTRODUCTION A VERY IMPORTANT
The version I played and upon which this walkthrough is based is v A slightly updated version v is due to be released shortly
In this version due to AGS limitations although you can generally enter amp or exit doors and other openings easily it is sometimesextremelydifficult There are even occasions where I had to try a dozen times or more before succeeding However this glitch is well known to the Developer who gave me the following advice and since using it I had NO TROUBLES WHATSOEVER
If you have ANY difficultyclick a little past the door in the way you want Jessica to walk hellip e g If you want to enter a door near the top of the screen click a little bit above it Similarly if you want to enter a door at the left side of the screen click a little bit to the left of the door
B The operative cursors are in the form of a with a small picture indicating its use just above and to the right Theactive spotof each of these cursors is the center red point of the and not the picture hellip as might be assumed incorrectly
C In this walkthrough whenever it says ldquo Talk to rdquo or ldquo Take Pick up Grab etc
rdquo alwaysLOOKat the person or object first
D When talking to ANYBODY alwaysexhaustalldialogue options until they start repeating
E You can play each section of the game inmanydifferent orders The following walkthrough describes onlyoneof these hellip and not necessarily the best
It rsquo s best to play in yourOWNindividual order hellip so long as you do everything essential sooner or later you will advance easily throughout the game
F There are avery largenumber of actions youmustperform and all of them are described here There are some actions which are notessentialto complete the game Most of these have NOT been included in the walkthrough hellip but of course if you DO perform them they cannot possibly lsquo spoil rsquo your game they may even add to it
G This walkthrough has been arranged as far as possible ONLY in accordance withthe logical development of the game hellip andNOTthe shortest amp or quickest route
As an example Suppose the logic of the game leads you to enter some location in order to pick up object X and you do so You see there often well displayed object Y which is not neededat that timebut will probably be essential later The walkthrough willNOTtell you to pick it up although no harm will be done if you do hellip which would be the most efficient method Later on in the game it will probably be apparent logically that you need Y for some later sequence and the walkthrough will tell you to return to the same location to get it Obviously this is not the quickest way to play or describe the game If of course you DID pick it up earlier you will not need to return to pick it up later hellip no harm will have been done and you will have saved a little time J This may quite probably seem long winded and a very long way round but anybody who prefers to choose short cuts is perfectly free to do so hellip nobodyhas tounnecessarily waste time
H Before you start playing the game you should choose between two resolutions lsquo winsetup exe rsquo file hellip x or x
WARNING Unless your computer isvery lsquo old rsquo do NOT use the former resolution hellip some important items areveryblurred and disturbing
Also once you choose a resolution setting ALL your previous saves will not be valid at the other setting

NOT TO BE MISSED Pictures of ALL the manyEXCELLENTvoice actors and actresses hellip and a little bit of final fun
Solution to the ldquo Control Panel Puzzle rdquo
You have to make all the circular lights buttons the same hellip either bright red or dark almost black hellip it doesn rsquo t matter which
Since the start setting is random if you want to save a little time effort you can choose the color which has the majority of the buttons set at the beginning
When you succeed the small red light at the top left corner of the puzzle will turn green hellip and ldquo Curse You rdquo
To exit the completed puzzle click the blue circular arrow at the bottom left corner of the screen
METHOD Just as an example suppose you decide to change all the red buttons to black ones and you start randomly with the orientation as in the diagram below A A A A B B B B C C C C D D D D Deal with each individual button in ANY order as though it is theonlybutton there i e
totally ignoring all the others red and black as though they don rsquo t exist
Use the mantra ldquo BUTTON ABOVE BELOW RIGHT LEFT rdquo and apply it to each red hellip in this case button in turn
Starting with an lsquo easy rsquo one Click C B D C C Notice that C has changed from red to blackwithout ANYTHING else changing ALWAYS Five correct clicks for any button lsquo reverses rsquo it without affecting anything else
Continue similarly with Click B A C B B
But what happens if the button you need to change is on the top or bottom row You apply what is known as lsquo wrap around rsquo The row lsquo above rsquo the top row lsquo is rsquo the bottom row Likewise The row lsquo below rsquo the bottom row lsquo is rsquo the top row
So click A D B A A hellip and D C A D D
Similarly The column lsquo to the right rsquo of the right most column lsquo is rsquo the left most column Likewise The column lsquo to the left rsquo of the left most column lsquo is rsquo the right most column So click B A C B B hellip and C B D C C
Corner buttons are the lsquo trickiest rsquo since you have to apply both of the above wrap arounds
Hence Click A D B A A hellip and D C A D D
By now in this example ALL the buttons are black and you have completed the puzzle

You are at the Marketplace
You may talk to the Balloonist if you like but what is necessary here is to cross the market and go the to stall opposite the Balloonist
You must find the one stall that has an active cursor and take theOld Dinosaur Skinand theGrease
Exit here and use theMonorailto find theAcademy which has been closed until now
Finding your way around the Academy As you first enter there is abright reflection on the floor and the door you can see is the exit
Go to the far left from this scene for the Lab or go to the far right for the Archive room
Enter the Laboratory the room seen from the balcony

Enjoy the cutscene
Having trouble placing the helium
Face the man and search for a very small hot spot that creates a close up view
That's the place for the helium
Gustav brings you to an amazing area flying over browsing dinosaurs and landing in a field full of Mastodons grazing on the vegetation
A giant is tending the herd
Talk with him about everything then take theMastodon Hairslying on the ground
Go to the Village Gate and find it impassible because of a force field
Talk to the Giant again and he will give you sometobacco and tell you the secret to entering the village
Go to the village gate now and place your knives on the ground
You will be able to enter
Visit with the Matriarch A ra Mnud who is standing in the twig house
During the conversation you learn that there is a problem with the force field that protects them from harm
Sounds sort of like the hole in the Ozone layer
Talk with her about everything then visit the fisherman who is at the far left
Give him the tobacco and talk with him
He knows about the weather and he needs arare fireflyfor bait
If you go back toward the Matriarch and further right you will find the Gardener
As you talk with him you understand his concern abouttomorrow's weather and how it could affect his fragile plants
Ask the Fisherman about the weather and heexpects fog
Warn the Gardener about the fog and he will request that you visit the healer
Her name is Jahin Duubra and she is to be found further in the village tending a sick baby Mastodon
Notice as you approach her infirmary you can see an island floating in the distance between the mountains
Talk to her about everything and she will cast a spell to protect the Garden
She asks you to gather some Bitter Berries
They are found at the base of one of the posts in Initiation Alley which is in the far rear of the village
If you had explored before the alley was blocked by a force field but the way was opened when you talked to the Matriarch
She also gives you aprotected branch whereby you may enter the bamboo Jousting Arena
Examine her shelves and take theEmpty Shell
Go further toward the cleft in the mountains
Look closely at the posts on the left and find theBitter Berrieson the ground
She told you to protect your hands so use the Gloves to pick the berries
Return to Jahin Duubra and give her the berries
Now you have her trust and she tells you she is aware of the conspiracy and how to approach the puzzle making the floating island accessible
She says the sounds are produced by selecting two of six choices and that they must be in order
Get the clues from the six posts at the arches
Inform the Gardener that his plants will be safe from the fog
He gives you afirefly which you should take to the Fisherman
He is grateful and gives you a living shell
Regarding the Initiation Alley posts and symbols he informs you that the sequence of the symbols' meaning is the five senses
The order isSmell Hearing Sight Taste and Touch
Return to the Gardener's area and use theRepellent Wandto open the Jousting Arena
Talk with the magician but pay attention
When you exit the conversation he will vanish
Look at the stone urn
Place the Empty Shell the Living Shell and the Mastodon hairs in it
The hairs cause the creature in the Live Shell to abandon his quarters and hide in the empty shell
Now take the formerly live shell and it shatters revealing aVegetable Lens
As you pass between the arches in Initiation Alley copy down the six different symbols visible on the base of the posts
These symbols represent the sounds you will hear while solving the Floating Island puzzle
Are you really intrepid and a glutton for punishment
It is actually possible to solve this puzzle by a combination of logic brute force patience and luck
You will find six posts surrounding the pit where the island arose
If you close any two holes by sliding the leaves across them then touch the Mask a sound will be produced
Note that there are thirty possible combinations of two posts and only six are correct and to make it just a teeny bit difficult you must produce all six sounds in the correct sequence with absolutely no mistakes or you must begin anew
A major complaint I have about this puzzle is that it makes no allowance for people who cannot hear the sounds
Anyone who is either short on hearing ability or short on patience may click here to see the solution
Well
whaddya know
There's Adam again
Do you have the Vegetable Lens in your possession
If so DO NOT open the topic called quot Come Down quot If you do you will need to solve that big Island lowering puzzle again
Is that fair or what
You must go to the far right hand end of the island to place the Vegetable Lens over the Halo that is producing coarse light
If you do this before talking with Adam the topic of quot Come down quot never arises
Once you have placed the lens say Goodbye to Adam and you will exit the island
Go through the village and across the pasture where the Balloonist sits
Go to the door in the stone and you will be at the Submarine Dock
Notice the quot People Counter quot in the entryway that says quot quot Enter the submarine and either attempt to enter into the hold or speak to the Captain
He asks you to leave
Exit the dock through the round door and return to the village
Go to the Fisherman and speak to the character standing there to his right
He is a child who will accompany you to the Submarine Dock
Since you enter together only one person is counted
Still says quot quot When the child exits the counter resets to quot quot making it seem to the captain that you have left
He lets his guard down and will not be there when you enter the sub
Use your glove to open the door and find the control panel at the left of the next door
Enter the Code that Adam gave you and you will enter the hold hide there and the sub departs for the mine
Talk to the Captain about everything
He wants a favor and will give you avisitor's passin return
You need to sneak into the mine by hiding in the automatic rail car
Set the control on the side and hop into the car
You arrive at the site where Maoro Fi is working
Talk to him
Give him the seeds
He gives you amessage for Angus the Captain
Read it and return to Angus
Give him the message and learn about the revolt that is brewing
He gives you a Visitor's Pass
Walk into the mine
Speak with the worker standing there
He needs aFilterto repair the equipment and gives you anOrder Slip
Find the elevator across the tracks and take it up to the top
Cross over the pipe and talk with Hutha M o
He says you can't visit the Geyser which is right where he's standing
Go into the warehouse
Talk with Amalia and give her the Order Slip for the Filter
Pick up the Telegram that fell out of her window
It seems not everyone is wholly truthful all the time
Go around the first shelves then search on the right for the Filter
Opposite that point on the left find the pencil and paper
Combine the pencil and paper to reveal a diagram
Read it
Then proceed to the rear of the room the sorting area where Kia Tran is working
Read the posters on the wall on the way to the rear
You can cross the little bridge at the end of the room or talk to Tran from the side where the posters are it doesn't matter
He is not quite honest but he informs you about a Laboratory
The laboratory is inaccessible because Hutha M o is still guarding it
You need to find a way to distract him
Exit the warehouse and take the elevator down
Give the Filter to the Technician and he will tell you to help adjust the machinery
Look at the control panel and set the dials according to the information in your encyclopedia
If you do it correctly the Technician will admit there might be a way to the surface
Go up the elevator and find the Operations Shack the solitary blue building
Inside you will meet with Taal Nadi
Talk with his about everything until suddenly B r s Mohul shows up outside the building
He is not to be trusted and you should ask Taal Nadi to get rid of him
You will be alone in the Operations Center
Find the Sheet of Iron leaning on one of the machines and take it
Look at the control panel that happens to be the security system for the Geyser
You must swap the black and white numbers
It's easy but if you can't figure it outLook at This Exit the Operations Shack and find the Paddle Wheel
This provides power to the generator that supplies electricity to the mine
Put the Sheet of Iron in the sluice and the water stops
Now you can descend into the hydroelectric pit
Use the Machete to cut the leather belt
You can descend into the pit with the water running and see the wheel turning but you can't do anything until the water is stopped
Now if you talk to Hutha M o he will leave his post and try to repair the system
You can now take the Geyser up to the higher level providing you have unlocked the security system
In order to talk to him you must walk out into the central area where you get the panoramic overhead view and click the talking head on him
If you try to walk up to him directly you can't
Entering the Geyser you must punch in the correct code on the diamond shaped panel
Refer to the document called quot Schema quot in your computer for the pattern
The device squirts your little car upstairs to an exterior walkway that leads to the Laboratory
Enter the lab and hide behind the bookcase while Armanda wraps up her conversation on the phone
Armanda leaves and you are locked in
Walk in front of the lab bench then when the scene reverses go to the upper right and find the Vial of Acid next to the sink
Open the bookcase and read the document found in the large red book
Yes
They are dealing with people on the surface
The plot thickens
Go to the desk
The way to get there is a little dicey click on the little bit of floor visible to the right of the bookcase scene then on the little bit of floor to the right of the desk
Once there pick up the document under the scales
Translation There are twelve white balls in the puzzle One of them is different that is either lighter or heavier than the others
You can weigh sets of balls to find the different one but only three times
You must deduce from the three weighings which one does not match the rest If you have to re do the puzzle the odd one is randomly chosen
To use the scales Place the desired balls on the two trays and press the control tab looks like marble to compare the weights
The green number tells you which trial you are performing and the red triangles point to the center equal or to the left Left group heavier or to the right Right group heavier
After performing a trial the pans need to be reset
Press the control once more to set the pans
The number switches from to and the triangular indicator goes out
Do the same thing between trial and Don't reset the pan after the third trial
When you know which ball is different pick it up and close the scene by clicking on the icon at the upper left
This exits the puzzle with a ball in your inventory
Examine the ball to see if it is unique
Let's do it by the numbers Start by making your three groups FIRSTWeigh and
Three outcomes are possible EqualLeft heavyRight Heavy
If they are unequal either the heavy set contains the heavier ball or the lighter set contains the lighter ball you can't tell which yet
Jump down to the appropriate paragraph Suppose they were equal on the first try This means the odd one is in the other group
To sort out the odd one in only two more weighings replace one ball in this group with one known not to be the odd one
For example SECONDWeigh against
Again three outcomes are possible EqualLeft heavyRight heavy
If they are equal the odd one must be the one you left out You don't care if it's light or heavy just different
If the left pan weighs heavy either the heavy ball is or or the light ball is or and it can't be THIRDWeigh against If or shows up heavy there's your answer If equal that leaves as light Suppose they were left heavy on the first try This means either there's a heavy ball in the left group or a light ball in the right group and the third group are all neutral
Now you want to weigh two sets of three balls
As before take one from the known group I'll use and add it to the others and treat them as follows Notice you began with three sets of four this time you are using three sets of three
SECONDWeigh against leaving and out for now
Why this way
can't be heavy and can't be light and can't be odd
If they are equal then either or or is your odd ball THIRDWeigh against
You will find the light one there or conclude that must be heavy
If the left pan is heavy then either the heavy ball is among or the light ball is among THIRDWeigh against
You will find the heavy one there or conclude that is light
If the right pan is heavy then either the heavy ball is among or the light ball is among THIRDWeigh against
Either will be found to be heavy or conclude that is light
Suppose they were right heavy on the first try This means either there's a heavy ball in the right group or a light ball in the left group and the third group are all neutral
Now you want to weigh two sets of three balls
As before take one from the known group I'll use and add it to the others and treat them as follows Notice you began with three sets of four this time you are using three sets of three
SECONDWeigh against leaving and out for now
Why this way
can't be light and can't be heavy and can't be odd
If they are equal then either or or is your odd ball THIRDWeigh against
You will find the heavy one there or conclude that must be light
If the left pan is heavy then either the heavy ball is among or the light ball is among THIRDWeigh against
You will find that is light or conclude that is heavy
If the right pan is heavy then either the heavy ball is among or the light ball is among THIRDWeigh against
Either or will be light or you conclude that is heavy
Take the ball you know to be different into your inventory
Examine it to be sure it is quot a unique specimen and very hard to find quot and exit the lab by using the acid on the locked door
Go into the Geyser and place the White Ball on the pipe stand to go up one more level
You will be entering Alexander's private office
Go to the desk
Find and examine the Photograph read the page from the diary take the Original Reel of film and the CD
Analyze the CD to discover that he is in fact dealing with people on the surface
Save your game before you try to exit the office

The choice is yours
You can explore up the stairs if you wish in which case you get a nasty gram from your publisher
Pooh
TheLarge door leading to the surface results in your instant fame and welcome from your friends
However you cannot return below and thegame ends
The Small Door takes you back to the mine area
At the foot of the geyser Taal Nadi talks to you and believes you now
He tells you to talk to Adam the Shaman who is in the Control Shack
Talk to him and he gives you some instructions for opening the safe
Read the paper on the floor and it says to add Black Diamond powder to the acidic solution and White Diamond powder to the basic solution
Before you leave that thatSheet of Ironagain
Return to the Laboratory
This means enter the geyser and take it up one level using the diamond shaped panel
As you enter the lab the safe is on that wall to the right Before you can unlock it however you need to go to the far opposite corner of the room where the dirty sink is
Take the Test Strips from the left sideboard
Be sure to quot Analyze quot them
Read about them in the computer to activate them
Now go to the Safe
Test each tube with the test strips to determine which is acid which is base and which is neutral
Add theBlackpowder to thebluetube theWhitepowder to theredtube and you are done
Turn the wheel to open the safe and read the documents The accounts and orders
Return to the bottom of the Geyser and talk with Taal Nadi
He trusts you still and will wait for you in the village
Go to the Derrick in order to go downstairs into the mine
Before descending take the Ladderthat is lying on its side at the Derrick
Go down into the mine
Go to the right across the tracks and place the ladder at the device that looks like a Laundromat
If it is dark in the mine find the switch that is also right there
Go up the ladder and see the Dynamite
Use yourknifeto cut the fuse andtake the dynamite
Come down the ladder and return to where the elevator is
Go left and find therail caron the tracks in front of a large locked gate
Look at the car full of dynamite

Exit the mine to the dock
Talk to Angus
He doesn't believe you yet
Find the little footsteps that take you to the very end of the tracks and place thePiece of Ironthere to create asort of ramp
Isn't is weird how the big piece of iron in your inventory looks smaller than the reel of film
That must be some movie
Go back inside the mine across the tracks near the Derrick and go left until you find the mine car full of dynamite

Thenshove the mine cardown the tracks and it will crash into the sea in full view of Angus
Talk to him and now he is convinced of the dangerous conspiracy
He takes you back to the land of Giants
Talk to Gustav when you arrive
He gives you a choice
You could either go to the Giants' village or to Askiam
Both paths are correct
I chose to go to the Giants
Enter the Giants' village and talk to Jahin Duubra
If she was such a great healer you'd think that baby Mastodon would be all better by now
You need to retrieve theMemory Ballfrom the Arena in order to provide absolute proof of Alexander's guilt
She gives you aButterflyto help open the wall to the arena
Take the big redSnare Flowerfrom her shelf
At the Arena you need towater the flowers
using theFlask
Set the Butterfly free and you will be able to enter
In the arena place the Trapping Plant on the stone slab in front of the main altar It entices the Memory Ball which is trapped
Sort of reminds one of Harry Potter snagging the Snitch eh
Take the Memory Ball to Jahin who believes your story now and gives you a flute which will provide access to the Garden at night
Use the flute to enter the Garden
The Giantess is nowhere to be found she must be up there on the floating island
Go around the pit to theStone Mask
The mask is broken and unable to lower the garden but there is a Message there
Pick it up and read it
Ariane better keep your head down and your mouth shut for a while
There's no shortage of enemies lurking about
It would be nice if we could summon Gustav and get a ride out of the garden but no you must walk all the way back through the village and across the dung strewn pasture
Talk to Gustav and get taken to the city of Askiam
Visit the booth to get two items
See where the cursor is on the wooden table Click there to get to the correct booth There is no hot spot to indicate you should go thereand you could feel very stuck
Take theBlue Clothand theTelephone Token
The Altimonorail is not an option right now Armanda is guarding this station and B r s Mohul is guarding the one near the communications center
You must distract him for you need to get to the Academy
Try to go to the communications center and you cannot do so while he is guarding it
Go to the Crossroads and talk to Enrique who is standing at the Altimonorail station
He will provide you with a list of phone numbers for the five telephones in the city
Be sure to read the list
You must visit all the other four phones in order to trigger the desired action
In any order you like Once you have seen all the telephones you have deduced the number of the one where Mohul is
Place the Blue Cloth over the phone's microphone and use the token to call him
He will be gone
Take the monorail to the Academy and enter the Lab
Pick up the document on the table Conference paper and be sure to read it looking at page and page
Also open the little wooden box and take the document
Analyze the document to learn the coordinates
Go to the table at the other end of the room
This is a quot Tower of Hanoi quot puzzle
A brief hint Starting from a pile containing anodd number of pieces move the first piece to the peg you want to finish on
Starting with an even number of pieces that need to be moved put the first piece on the peg you don't want to finish on
Thus thefirst moveshould be fromone to three
Having solved the puzzle take the document and the bottle of Plimentaire
Exit the Lab and go into the Archive Room
Find the funny teletype machine and click twice on the handle to get a look at the Rector's recent reading choices
The plot thickens

Exit the Archive room only to be discovered by Alexander and B r s Mohul
After the threatening conversation you find yourself in jail
Go to the right to the other end of the room
You see a table where someone has recently been eating a basket suspended from a rope and a chest of drawers with a document sitting on it
Take the document and read it
Walk up to the closed stone door and push on the left side to open it
In the next room find theFuseand thePeriscope diagramon the long table
Go to the far corner and find Peter
He is reluctant to talk but talk to him anyway about everything
He mentions missing some parts as indicated on the diagram but needs a way to illuminate the interior without actual flame
Maybe you can help but he is skeptical
Come around the near side of the Periscope and rotate it only to get yelled at
Return to the other room
Combine thefuse and dynamite and place them in the hanging basket
Use the lighter to ignite the fuse
Movie Ariane lights the fuse pulls the basket upward and blows a hole in the ceiling
Pick up theIron Rod
Combine the rod with the rope
Finally
a use for the rope
Step back toward where you started and use the rod rope to climb up through the opening
You are in the coal cave right back where you began
Exit out the back through the quot Seals quot door and into the Mushroom Forest
Talk to Adam who is right there but hard to see
He tells you to go to the jungle to visit Jahin and to find some bones
He also tells you he needsfood a blanket a mattress a box and some coal
What he doesn't tell you is where to find those things
Actually the box and the coal are nearby in the mine
Go back into the mine and to the area where you first found the metal seals and the old chisel
Thebox and the coalhave been there along but you must have had the conversation with Adam in order to trigger the ability to pick them up
Return to the Mushroom forest and go one node past Adam and pick someferns
This will serve as his mattress
Go up to the lookout post atop the mushroom and take theblanket and the food
Now you can return to Adam and give him everything quot Installation

They are on the table not on the desk he pointed to as he was speaking
Read the coordinates
Use the Periscope for the final time
The table shows the seals as they first appear
You are free to scramble them around in and out of the circle because if you back away from the puzzle then re start it they will all reset to their original positions
I have numbered their positions on the grid representing the sequence they should appear on the circle starting at the top left and proceedingcounter clockwise all the way around to the top right Cover holes and then touch the Mask
Cover holes and then touch the Mask
Cover holes and then touch the Mask
Cover holes and then touch the Mask
Cover holes and then touch the Mask
It's a simple pattern that works by making all the possible moves alternating colors Move one black number to the right Move two white numbers to the leftMove three black numbers to the right then four five five four three two one

Put the environ cartridge into the video projector
This plays a sequence revealing all
You will be knocked unconcious and taken to the disused missile silo The missile silo
Arrival You wake up strapped into a chair with the other agent who has framed you explaining their actions
This sequence takes quite a time and you can only wait for it to finish
After a while Arthur talks to you as well and explains that he is trying to sabotage the computer system
Eventually he gets into the system but requires a password Read the dosier on the other agent in BioChip files
Look at the profile on the agents and then at their interests
Type in the name of their first recreation
This should be the password
Another animated sequence follows as their computer is destroyed by Arthur Once you are free to move go RRFFD pick up the generator core
Go URRFD look at the right hand side of the generator console
Press the button to eject the core
Remove the dead core
Look away and then look back
Insert the new generator core

Touch this machine
A control panel will appear with two triangular buttons and a larger 'run program' button
Press the triangular buttons till 'transport code' is displayed
Now press the 'run program' button
A piece of material will be produced bearing a numeric code
Note this code down
You may have to repeat the program to read it all it disappears quite quickly Once you have the transport code turn right and look at the yellow notice at the bottom left of the notice board in front of you
Make a note of what this says
Now look away and look back at the black rectangle in front of you

Look at the section on 'Symbiotry technology' and listen to the new clip Now step forward to the section on 'appeal for dismantling'
In this section look for the name of the race mentioned in the new clip
Click on it's name highlighted in red
Read the technical information on this race
The information under 'sensory perception' at the end of this article should match what you read off the yellow notice
If it does note down the 'transport prefix'
If not look at other races till you find the right one Leave the video screen
Go RFLFRR you should be facing the transport machine
Touch it touch the screen that appears
Now type in the transport code followed by the transport prefix
If this is wrong it is fatal so save your game
Move forward into the transporter
You will materialise on the alien spacecraft The Alien craft
Destroying the time machine Starting where you arrive in the matter transporter
You must still have the lens used earlier attached to your camera as otherwise you cannot see
Move FFLFRFR cloak immediately
Once the aliens have passed uncloak
Touch the fibrous bar at the bottom centre of your screen to activate the transport system
This sucks you through the alien ship repeat this at the next intersection At the end of the transport tube go FRFL

Touch it
You should see the Mediaeval sword inside
Use the explosive charge that you received at the Farnstein station to blow the nodule open
Pick up the sword
Back away and then look at the other nodule
Touch this to open it and use the sword to cut it open
Touch the 'cheese girl' container
Back away go RFL
Repeat the opening and cutting sequence an keep moving round the room the same way
You will pick up The interactive sculpture The Codex Atlanticus The Mayan Puzzle Box and the Environ Chip Once you have this turn RRF
This brings you back to the entrance to the transport tube
It is worth saving you game again here as there is an easily fatal bit to follow
Touch the fibrous bar to activate the transport system and again repeat this at the halfway stop When you reach the end of the tube you will be unable to move and if you take more than a few seconds the aliens will kill you
Use Richard's sword to cut the fibrous bar on the tube ahead of you
This disables the transport tube and you are one more able to move
Go LFLF back to the transporter
At this point you will be captured by the Ambassador Alien Ship
Escape from the matter transmitter This whole sequence requires reasonable speed
You are trapped inside a matter transmitter pod that is about to transport your BioSuit off you leaving you to die in the alien aquasphere Remove the 'burned out core' from your temporal pocket
If you looked at this core earlier you would have read a warning that this can disrupt transporter beams
Hold the core in the beam around you
The beam disrupts and traps the Ambassador in the pod opposite you
Move forward and touch the purple button on the right of this pod
This sends him off somewhere Now move RFRR into the pod that he arrived in
Touch the purple button on this pod to transport yourself to safety
A sequence ends with you being mindwiped and returned to your own time
That's it folks
I tended to find watching all the news clips a little boring myself and skipped some
There are extra points for looking at these and all the papers in Leonardo's time etc
I got so I've missed a couple somewhere
Maybe you can find these extra points by being a little more patient than me
I hope the text is accurate but a few errors are bound to have slipped in
GAME BOOMERS hints cheats and walkthroughs
Legacy of Time The Journeyman Project Comments amp Walkthrough By Soren Andersen General Remarks This game is the third in theJourneymanseries and like the others a central theme is that in the th century in which it is set time travel mdash at least into the past mdash has been accomplished but it is a closely guarded secret lest some unscrupulous person go back in time and by changing something that has happened could then alter subsequent history such a deed would cause a change from that point in time onward and history as known would no longer be true
There would be a temporal distortion of a size that could be a from ripple to a huge wave depending upon the severity of the historical change
The Temporal Security Agency TSA has been established to guard the secret of time travel to detect temporal distortions and to thwart any miscreant who attempts to alter history
You do not have to have played the previous two games in order to undertake this one but if you have you will enjoy a much greater understanding of the background action against which this game is played
The introduction on page of the instruction booklet from the CD jewel case provides a concise summary of this background and pages ndash presents a timeline of relevant events from to the present day and introduces the principal characters reading this information carefully will be of invaluable assistance in following the story
It gives nothing away to relate that the game opens with a preliminary cinematic sequence in which the villainess of game who was swept away in a time stream along with artificial intelligence Arthur in the course of foiling her plot comes out of this stream in just at the time and place to witness the destruction of Atlantis and somehow also El Dorado and Shangri La three of Adventure game favorite locations
The scene then shifts to the spaceshipOraclein which our hero Gage Blackwood TSA Agent is on patrol with Cyrollan allies of the Symbiotry they see an attack on and destruction of frontier outpostHelmby anther space ship
The Cyrollan commander recognizes the attacker quot They have returned quot he says
Fade out
That's the prelude
Now the game shows you a main screen that offers you choices
A New Game choice shows another movie sequence that gives more background sets the scene for upcoming action and introduces you to the newly developed Chameleon Jumpsuit
After putting it on and trying it out a little you are ready to go and finally interact with the game
Incidentally after a cinematic sequence has been shown it becomes available for replay using the game's menu bar
In part of the game you go to the three destroyed locations to learn about their ruin
In part you return to each of them before their destruction to search for three artifacts one in each place that can be used in the fight against the attackers
You cannot simply go to each in turn and complete the mission there because certain items you need in one scenario are found in another however you can go back and forth as often as you wish and when you return to one you will be in the same place as you left
After the first mandatory jump to the destroyed Atlantis you can go to the sites in whatever order you desire the walkthrough that follows uses one of the more efficient sequences
Unlike the other games you cannot die in this one and you can't get stuck but you should nevertheless save often
Getting used to the ability to change guises might be a problem at first and the plot at times seems hard to follow The Buddhist beliefs are particularly obscure
So much for introductory remarks use them to find your way through the game
It is to be hoped that you will not need the walkthrough that follows because using the lightbulb function with Arthur provides increasingly explicit help and the spacebar gives indications on which way to go so you should need the walkthrough only when you get really stuck
SorenAndersen June Walkthrough ndash Part Now that you have read all the introductory materials and watched closely the beginning movie sequences you click on the bar at the top of the screen and you are transported back in time to Atlantis destroyed BC October From the sights around you and the slight rocking motion you can deduce that you have landed on something floating in the wrecked harbor of Atlantis
Turn and face the shore then go up to the base of what is left of the windmill Agent 's jumpsuit appears Click on it the helmet opens and you meet Arthur who then joins you in your chameleon jumpsuit and you will see him from now on in the lower right of the screen

Optional Click the cursor on the rope right above the basket edge You will get a closeup showing a hook on the end of the rope
Click on the handle in the rope the rope will swing and hook a basket on another balloon pull it toward you and you will jump to it
Find the timecode on the side of the basket
Click on it and another destruction sequence movie shows
When the cursor appears as a pointing hand click it on the bar at the top of the screen and go to the Himalayan Mountains Shangri La destroyed AD April Arrival is on a snowbank next to a severely damaged gatehouse across a ravine from a destroyed monastery
Arthur says the destruction is from an avalanche

Turn right and go down the snowbank toward a dead soldier lying in the snow
Pick up the wooden staff next to the soldier and to the right the spoked windlass wheel
Return to your landing spot then down into the gatehouse and ahead out to the former bridge

If you try to climb down the wrecked bridge you will find the end too far from the ground and you will have to climb up again
Once more go back up to the location where you arrived
Reenter the gatehouse going to the right where the bridge mechanism is located
Put the windlass wheel on the gate mechanism then turn it which will extend the collapsed hanging bridge
Return to bridge
With the bridge extended you can now climb down and jump to the bottom of the ravine
Turn left and walk to the monastery building with many windows
Find the loose window that you can pry open with the staff you found by the dead soldier
Go through the window and to the Buddha statue with the blue robe and hair
Using the Buddha climb to me upper part of the monastery
Look around to find the timecode drawn in the snow
Click on the code
This time the movie sequence is of aliens searching the ruins Having the timecodes Arthur computes Agent 's location and that is where you go to find her with a dying Eliot Sinclair the exiled time travel genius from the previous games
You take her back to the TSA wherethere is a long cinematic sequence including Jhessela the Cyrollan ambassador in which it develops that a long vanished race the Sosiqui has left behind something called a quot legacy quot that is needed to defeat the brutal Quo'Thalas who are now attacking earth
You have to listen carefully to Jhessela to learn about this age old enemy who was thought to have been thoroughly crushed and routed in ancient battles but now have come back to obtain the legacy for themselves
One part of this legacy is in temples at each of the destroyed sites as it turns out this fact is why they were devastated You are now ready for Part in which you go back to the three destroyed sites on one day before their destruction to look for the three parts artifacts of the all important legacy Walkthrough ndash Part Mediterranean Sea Atlantis BC Oct As it happens you arrive on the roof of the not yet ruined windmill where you left in Part

Change to the guise of the beggar
Climb the ladder steps on the wall
Go left and get Arthur's reading of the murals
Capture the guise of the templar Soros and listen to his lament Talk to him He will give you a disk and leave

Get a closeup of the clock mechanism and put the disk between the large gear and the crank on the right
Click once on the crank Stuff turns and a roaring noise is heard
Go back the way you came and up flights of stairs to the upper temple
Use the gaff to open the water gate that you had previously closed
A fountain of water shoots up from the bottom of the shaft and the pyramidal artifact appears in it Take the artifact and you will be transported back to the TSA In the movie sequence that now plays Blackwood brings the artifact to a group that includes Commissioner Baldwin Chief Engineer Dalton and Ambassador Jhessela
The latter authenticates the artifact as being part of the legacy but says she cannot make out any of the mysterious markings
Nor can Dalton Blackwood suggests that Agent be brought in since she is an expert on ancient languages
Baldwin at first refuses then reluctantly agrees
Blackwood sets off to retrieve more of the legacy
Himalayan Mountains Shangri La AD April Here you must locate six almost identical statues of Buddha each robed in a different color and representing different philosophical realms and present each with a gift
In return you will get a colored stone the set of which is returned to a second group of Buddha statues in order to earn your final steps to the artifact that is part of the legacy
You arrive at this location on stone steps leading up to a gatehouse across a deep ravine from a Tibetan monastery

Proceed along path away from gatehouse toward a human figure crouched face down in attitude of prayer in the path beyond a footbridge crossing the ravine to the monastery
Fortunately he does not look up to see your jumpsuit so you can capture the guise of this pilgrim
Turn around and cross ravine on footbridge to lower wall of monastery
Observe the colorful symbols and inscription on bank get Arthur's translation
Note the symbol meanings and also that which is quot the cause of all suffering quot
Go to the right toward the yaks and examine the Green Buddha have Arthur translate the symbols on the base
Return along the path past the footbridge to the grate in the wall
If you get a closeup of the grate you will see a handle beyond it that you may pull with the gaff this will open the grate and allow you entry to the steam tunnels under the monastery but you have not yet found a map of these tunnels nor learned anything about them
Instead continue along the pathway around the corner and up the stairs to the greenhouse
Assume the guise of the pilgrim and enter the greenhouse
Capture the guise of the gardener monk Amul then talk to him
Learn about the steam tunnels the wishing tree and the Pretas

Go into the greenhouse and around to the right to examine the Yellow Buddha Have Arthur read the inscription on the base of the statue

Go to the opposite side of the greenhouse and climb the ladder to the platform
Take the knife and the steam tunnel map A somewhat augmented sketch of this steam tunnel map is attached

Go back down the ladder and proceed around the wishing tree until you see a grate in the floor
Open the grate and descend

Pour the pitcher of healing water that you got in Atlantis on the roots of the wishing tree
They will be invigorated
Return to the platform in the greenhouse and take the fruit from the wishing tree

Return to the Yellow Buddha and place the fruit in the bowl that the statue is holding in its right hand
A spherical yellow stone appears in the statue's left hand
Take the stone
Talk to the gardener again if you wish
Return to the floor grating and descend once more
Just to the left of the roots of the wishing tree is an entrance to the steam tunnels
Go through it
Refer now to the map of the steam tunnels
You are presently below the building shown on the left in the map the one containing the large green tree
The greenhouse and the wishing tree
Note when the cursor shows as a hand the map may be moved vertically to display more of its area The map shows three fiery steam areas that you will recognize when you come to them
There are junction chambers each identified by the indicated symbols on the chamber ceilings each chamber has a gate that may be moved back and forth to one of two positions when you are in the chamber There is a special chamber identified by a skeleton that is the location of the Black Buddha statue There are four entrances exits to the tunnel system
You can successfully complete the program tasks only if you first use either the entrance from the greenhouse or from the grate of Step above
The Prayer Hall access is used the second time you go through the tunnel system
You cannot get past the Kahn at the access on the top right side of the map

Go through the tunnel to the west steam area
Go into the steam area and past it one step
Then turn slowly to the left to find the access to the tunnel maze do not confuse this tunnel with the return tunnel to the wishing tree root chamber
Proceed into the tunnel maze until you get to the chamber with the ornate cross on the ceiling
From now on your position in the maze will be marked on the map as will be the position of the gate in each chamber that you visit
Continue to the chamber with two interlocking circles on the ceiling

Continue through the middle steam area to the chamber with the seashell on the ceiling

Click on the upright handle to move the gate to the left
Go past the east steam area to the chamber with the image of a single thick horn on the ceiling this also resembles a sort of dunce cap
Continue on to the underground room resembling the one below the greenhouse but without the tree roots
You can hear Kahn muttering prayers
Climb the ladder rungs in the wall up to Kahn's tent

When the grate opens turn immediately to the left and take Kahn's sword than quickly return back down the ladder before Kahn discovers you and knocks you back down
That does not matter however as long as you have the sword
If you don't try again
Return to the chamber with the horn dunce cap image on the ceiling
In preparation for your return visit to the steam tunnels move the circular wooden gate from left to right closing the tunnel to Kahn's tent

Continue your return past the east steam area to the seashell chamber
Move the gate to the right so you can go to the chamber with two interlocking diamond shapes on the ceiling
Keep going to the next chamber this one has a set of crossed horns or tusks in the ceiling

Move the gate to the left so that you can go to the chamber with three eyeballs on the ceiling
Go through this chamber to the one with a skeleton mural on the wall
Approach the mural and have Arthur translate the writing below it
Turn left and approach the Black Buddha
Have Arthur interpret the inscription on the base
Turn left again
Take the bowl which the program says is a butter boiler
If Arthur is in his chatty mode you will learn that the Buddha is made of butter

Return to the three eyes chamber then the two horns chamber In this one return the gate to the right

Return through the two diamonds chamber to the seashell chamber where you must move the gate to the left again in preparation for your second visit to the tunnels
Then go through the middle steam area the two circles chamber the cross chamber and then to the west steam area
Now you must go to another part of the lamasery
The best way is to continue straight through the steam area whence you will come to the room with the wall grate
Click on the upright handle the grate will open and you will exit to the path where you were near the beginning approach to the monastery
Continue to the footbridge cross it and go up the steps to the entrance to the gatehouse

Enter the gatehouse and go to the main bridge to the lamasery
The bridge has not been opened and therefore you cannot cross but you will get a superb panorama of Shangri La for orientation and reference

Turn around and go back into the gatehouse to the Buddha mural then turn left and go up the stairs
At the top of the stairs capture the guise of the guard then talk to him
Give him the silk scarf when he asks for it
Say goodbye and return to the bridge
When the bridge opens cross it and move straight ahead to enter the monastery Prayer Hall
The high lama may be found at the right of the Buddha statue
Capture his guise talk to him as much as possible then leave and go to the center of the Prayer Hall
Approach the Blue Buddha and get the translation of the inscription on the base of the statue
Put the begging bowl that you got in Atlantis in the open left hand of the Buddha then retrieve the blue spherical stone from his right hand

Change to the guise of the lama and enter the tent
Talk to Kahn learn of the wheel of life Sidda and his secret

Leave Kahn go across the plaza to the set of doors that lead to the Wheel of Life temple
Go through doors and approach the White Buddha actually he is gray
Get translation of inscription on base of statue
The Buddha has his right hand to his ear as though listening for something and is facing a set of eight inscribed prayer wheels Arthur can translate the inscriptions and if you cause a wheel to turn a deep voice repeats it

The upper right wheel does not operate until you oil it with either olive oil in the bowl from Atlantis or butter from the Black Buddha shrine
The offering to the White Buddha is to have the prayer wheels repeat the sacred mantra Om Ma Ni Pad Me Hum Click wheels in that order
Take the white spherical stone from the left hand of the Buddha

Go through the doors beyond and into the Wheel of Life temple
Turn right and approach the tapestry on the wall

Get a closeup of the tapestry it shows the six realms of the wheel of life with the colored Buddhas in each one carrying a symbolic item Arthur can translate for you The white Buddha is carrying a lute The red Buddha is carrying a fiery sword The green Buddha is carrying a book The black Buddha is carrying fire The yellow Buddha is carrying a fruit The blue Buddha is carrying a bowl The association with the statues you have found is evident you have yet to take care of the green and black Buddhas
Arthur advises you to revisit the lama

Assume the guise of Kahn
Return to the Prayer Hall and the lama

Talk to the lama learn more of the Sidda and his secret When you ask about the Realms you must do so six times and each time ask about a different realm In particular when you ask about the animal realm the lama in turn will ask you a question about the cause of suffering see item to which you answer quot Ignorance quot and you will receive from him the Book of Knowledge

Leave the lama go all the way across the Prayer Hall to the far wall turn right and move to the grate in the floor
Open the grate and once more go into the steam tunnels
The mission this time is to set the gates so that two of the steam areas have unimpeded access to the skeleton mural chamber the Black Buddha being made of butter will then melt from the heat of the steam
Go through the chamber with the tree symbol on the ceiling to the two horns chamber and here move the gate to the left
Go to the eyes chamber and roll the gate to the right

Go through the single horn dunce cap chamber the east steam area the seashell chamber the middle steam area to the two circles chamber

Move the gate from right to left
Arthur announces quot You did it Gage quot
Go back through the tunnel maze to the Black Buddha chamber
The Buddha has melted from the heat of two connected steam areas and on top of the melt is the black stone
Take the stone
Return any way you wish to the exit grate leading to the path to the Green Buddha

Go to the Green Buddha and slide the Book of Knowledge through the hole in the statue's base
Take the green spherical stone that appears in the left hand of the statue

You now have all six stones
Cross the footbridge go up the steps and through the gatehouse to the main bridge which will open for you
Proceed to the location of the White Buddha and the prayer wheels and on into the Wheel of Life temple

When you look at the floor of the temple you will note that it is a duplicate of the tapestry
Go down the stairs to the temple floor

Examine the two murals and listen to Arthur
Grasp the spinning shining lotus on the wall and place it in your inventory
Get a closeup of the pink circle between the two large eyes
Turns out to be a lens showing the pilgrim you first encountered praying on the path below the gatehouse
Arthur announces that the pilgrim is the Sidda who has finally returned as predicted
You must now go and talk to him
Step down on the lotus petals and down the stairs to the bottom of the column then out of the temple
Go to the main bridge and ring the bell on the gatepost The bridge will open
Cross the bridge and approach the pilgrim
Talk to the pilgrim then give him the lotus
When he says you must become your true self change to your jumpsuit guise
He will change the lotus to the artifact you have been seeking and it enters your inventory
You will be transported back to the TSA headquarters for a transition movie sequence
In this sequence Daughton and Agent report that they have made some progress in deciphering the firstartifact
There is a violent reaction when the second artifact is placed near the first The news about the attacking Quo'Thala is worse
Blackwood sets off to search for the third artifact in El Dorado

Go back to the shaman's quarters where the guard is still keeping people out Turn away from the guard proceed along the passage to a clearing with a balloon on the ground on the far side
Get into the balloon basket Strike the talisman on the triangular piece of flint in order to light the balloon burner Balloon will rise and give a spectacular panorama of the area and the boy's dream
Find a view of the temple and zoom in on it Note the arrow shaped opening on the temple roof surrounded by four faces Note details of the faces and their position on the sides of the arrow Zoom out
Zoom in on the sculpture just beyond the temple It is a similar shaped arrow with the legendary two bird brothers fighting over it
Zoom out and click on the flame to turn the burner off You will descend to the ground where you took off
Return along the passageways and path to the temple entrance Continue ahead to the other side of the temple and find your way along the path through the shrubbery to the arrow shaped object that you saw from the balloon It is a pool full of water
At the entrance to the pool is a short pedestal with an arrow shaped depression Put the talisman in the depression The pool drains noisily
Go down the steps into the drained pool to find sets of stone faces on of the pool walls
Get closeup of first set of faces on the left
Recall the faces seen from the balloon on the temple roof Step

Water returns but instead of filling the pool it flows into the passageway and extinguishers the fire Return to the passageway and proceed along it until you are in a room that is under the temple where you saw the Couatl serpent image when you looked down the shaft Step
There are more wall paintings that Arthur can interpret

Click on the tongue of the image and the pyramidal artifact rises into the air
Grasp the artifact and put it in your inventory
Arthur sends you back to the TSA for another transitional movie When you return the situation is critical
The attackers are well within the solar system
The fact that all three parts of the legacy are together radiates enough energy that the TSA location can be detected by both the Cyrollans and the enemy Quo'Thala and the latter let loose radiation bolts on it
Now you have to perform the final task reassemble the legacy
Conclusion When the three pyramidal artifacts that make up the Sosiqui legacy are placed together in a triangle on the table that has been used to examine each one as Blackwood has returned them an image is projected from the face of each to the center of the triangle this image being a combination of the markings on the artifact faces and is supposed to be that of one found on an ancient Sosiqi relic found long ago by the Cyrollans it appears in the upper left of the screen
Arthur explains that if any two of the projected images overlap the parts cancel if the third face has the same projection it appears again
There are two ways to change the image fragments on an artifact you can spin the entire unit by clicking on a base corner or rotate the face by clicking on the apex of a pyramid
When you achieve the right combination things get very bright then a long somewhat hokey final cinematic brings the game to a close
Arthur can give guidance getting the correct selection of artifact faces
Shown below is one solution to the legacy

JULIA's memory blocks Julia asks Rachel to help recover her memory loss
The memories are in blocks
Restore the memory by assembling memory clusters
See memory clusters
Each cluster is made up of mixed picture squares from same or another cluster s
The object of the puzzle is to assemble the correct picture in each cluster
Each square can be interchanged in a cluster by left click on one and left click on the other square you want interchanged
To get a square picture from another cluster right click the square on the worked on cluster big one at top right where the picture from the other cluster is situated and the square will cycle through all the pictures situated on that x of the other clusters
Stop when you get the picture square needed
If the location of that square in the cluster you are working on is already correct for that cluster it is best that you move the correct square to another location in that worked on cluster before right click cycling
It is also best to complete one cluster first to remove that set of pictures from the cycling
The easiest and distinct picture to work on first is the green forest scene
Compile all the green pictures from the other cluster and then rearrange them to form the complete picture
The cluster background square turns green when correctly done
The squares cannot be moved anymore after the whole picture is assembled

important places for the natives The native questions MOBOT
Select the correct answers from the dialogue list
Stone formation with machete
The native believes it is here to test their faith
Lake filled with corrosive liquid
The lake is the symbol of the native's doom
It was formerly filled with holy essence of life
The masters punished them and filled it with the purple substance that drains the life out of them
Laser gun left here by the crew
The native believes that the laser gun was left by the masters to remind them of their inferiority
The gun returned a lot of the natives to ancient Xir
The native will now answer the questions
The beings from the stars They made special places altars to keep what the masters left
The leader of the tribe saw the space people descend from the sky but did not meet them like the other natives
The native greeters were killed punished by the masters exploration team
The leader survived the massacre because he hid
That is how they learned of what happened
The native asks if this time the masters will teach them and make his branch family proud
He is the watcher of the skies
The punishments There were punishments done to the natives
The artifacts were part of the last and third punishment exploration team
Previously another set of masters that are different from the last told them to repent their ways or die
They changed the essence of life to the purple liquid which kills
The first punishment was when the ancient lords came
They were proud then and thought to rule the universe
The lords destroyed cities and everything they invented
They were then trapped on this planet
Rachel surmised that they were more advanced then
Ith the great prophet traveled to the place in the mist
High above the third place of existence lives one of the ancient gods
The essence The natives depended on the essence which the masters made to kill
The prophecy states that a wanderer from the sky will restore the essence
The team copies the symbol of essence
Ith Ith was the last of the ancients
He was taken by the Ancient Lords
He battled Xir the Lord of the Sand
He succeeded
Ith was given a flying bird and traveled to the place in the mist
He came back and was killed in treachery at Gaethir
Ith spent a lot of time alone erecting structures which they now know as preparing them for the pilgrimage of enlightenment Pilgrimage of Enlightenment There are empty parchments left by Ith
Ith told the leaders that the pilgrimage is ready
Since the parchments are common to them they ignored it and subsequently forgotten
After the last punishment they resurrected the story of Ith
The natives did the journey of Ith as a rite of passage
They are handed the parchments and left alone
They traveled to sites that Ith visited and meditated on it
Whoever understands it will be the leader
Many tried yet none succeeded
The team will try
The native is pleased and gave them the parchmentshoping that they will come back with answers
Prophecy When Ith returned from the sky he brought the prophecy
It is foretold that new masters will descend from the sky in their shiny bird and bring the essence of life
They will bring back happiness joy and wipe the tears
The masters came and they were punished
Then they the team came
They will worship them and the circle is complete
Lake The essence once lived in the lake
Artifact Take leave of the native
He tells them something that is important
In each of the places of worship there is a hidden place where they can find something of importance Go and bring back joy to us

JULIA remarks that the ancient masters are observers with no ambitions
Rachel remembers that Ith came here to seek advice about the alien lords
The ancient tells them to ask their questions
Ask about himself They are Guardians hidden watching and learning
They do not influence other beings
They have been on endless solar systems even Earth
JULIA deduced that they are from another universe
They left messages long ago waiting to be discovered
Those that have evolved enough will understand the message
Evolution cannot be forced
The advanced beings have discovered and seek them for advice
Ask about other visitors The visitors that want to be their emissaries have failed
After accessing MOBOT's memory the ancient replies yes
The other wants to manipulate and dominate it is stronger than their agreement with the ancients
They influenced developing civilization
They failed and the ancients made them leave this system
Ask about fate of the expedition Rachel explains that she wants to help because of what the expedition did
The ancient became silent when questioned about whether he they influenced what happened to the expedition
It would not explain what happened to the expedition but stated that they did not have anything to do with it
Ask about the essence The failed race gave the inhabitants of Salia a trial that is unfair
One of them defeated this trial
Upon learning that the team wants to help the people of Salia he states that he will help
The ancient tells the team to do the ritual undergone by Ith
They have to slay Xir in the land of endless sand Salia
They can call Xir by emitting low frequency sounds
They can get help from the depths
Then come back to him and he will explain
Ask about Ith Ith was brought there by the failed race to impress Ith
Then the failed lords told Ith to undergo the ritual and that it was ordered by the ancients
This was a lie
Ith killed the lords and returned to the ancient
They tried to warn him but he didn't listen
He went back to his world and was slain
The ancients do not get involve in internal conflicts

Memory recovery module The memories are in blocks
Restore the memory by assembling memory clusters
See memory clusters
Each memory cluster to be assembled is made up of picture squares from same or another cluster s
The object of the puzzle is to assemble the correct picture in each cluster
Within a cluster each square can be interchanged by left click on one and left click on the other square you want interchanged
To get a square picture from another cluster right click the square on the worked on cluster big one at right where the picture from the other cluster is situated and the square will cycle through all the pictures situated on that x of the other clusters
Stop when you get the picture square needed
Oralternatively you can use the cycle button located just below the big cluster at right frame
If the location of that square in the cluster you are working on is already correct for that cluster it is best that you move the correct square to another location in that worked on cluster before right click cycling
It is also best to complete one cluster first to remove that set of pictures from the cycling
The easiest and distinct picture to work on first is the green forest scene
Compile all the green pictures from the other clusters and then rearrange them to form the complete picture
The cluster background square turns green when correctly done
The squares cannot be moved anymore after the whole picture is assembled
Achievement obtained Sweet memories you have recovered some of Julia's erased memory clusters

To the humans it has only been a couple of years
The Ambrosians have forgotten
It is said that one who obtains them restores faith in a better future
Dead lake Essence of our doom
Our punishments
If you understand our punishment he can reveal an important part of their history
Strange obelisks The stone of enlightenment
They were created by Ith as part of their pilgrimage of enlightenment
History Ask for a history lesson
They were taught the way of modesty
They were once the rulers of the bhialth Salia solar system
The built a settlement far from here
The Masters arrived and taught them in the form of punishments
First punishment The first punishment was when the ancient lords came
They were proud then and thought to rule the universe
The lords destroyed cities and everything they invented
A handful of them were brought to this place
They were then trapped on this planet
Second punishment They grew proud again and made a settlement close to the sacred essence
A flash of light changed the sacred essence of life to essence of doom
Ith the prophet performed a sacred rite and was taken by the masters to the place in the mist
Third punishment Ith returned to them and they were happy
His death divided the tribe into many branches
The leader of the branch saw the masters descend from the sky but did not meet them properly like the other greeters
The masters were offended and punished them
The leader survived the massacre because he hid
That is how they learned of what happened
The Ambrosian is now the watcher of the skies greeter
He hopes that they give their branch a new meaning
The Ambrosian showed hope for the future
The only hope is the ancient prophecy brought to them by Ith
Mythology Ith Ith traveled to a place of the mist high above third plane of existence where live the ancient gods
Ith learned how to calm the lords
He returned and during his time of solitude erected structures which they now know as preparing them for the pilgrimage of enlightenment Pilgrimage of enlightenment There are empty parchments left by Ith
Ith told the leaders that the pilgrimage is ready
Since the parchments are common to them they ignored it and subsequently forgot
After the last punishment they resurrected the story of Ith
The Ambrosians did the journey of Ith as a rite of passage
They are handed the parchments and left alone
They traveled to sites that Ith visited and meditated on it
Whoever understands it will be the leader
Many tried yet none succeeded
The team will try
The Ambrosian is pleased and gave them the parchmentshoping that they will come back with answers
The prophecy When Ith returned from the sky he brought the prophecy
It is foretold that a wanderer from the sky will come and restore the essence of life reverting the punishment
Somewhere in the bhialth lies a place where the essence can be discovered
The Ambrosian draws a symbol
Mobot copies the symbol
Artifact from altar Mobot says that they will get the artifacts and give it to them
The Ambrosian is in awe
The contraption will come alive when the essence of punishment corrosive purple liquid is poured on it
He gives Mobot a purplish container so that he can handle the essence of punishment
If Mobot gets the artifacts he will give them the artifact of wisdom another item left by the ancients

When Ambrosians obeyed ancients they were highly developed on Xenophone
When they got too proud avoided the Ancients they ended up with bare paws on Ambrosia
There is also a reason why gun is attached to former and machete to the latter
