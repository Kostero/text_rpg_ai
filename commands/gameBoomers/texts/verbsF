Transported back to OMM you demand to know how to fix this Seems like you have a lot of making up to do hellip Lets start with the Old Lady
Go back up the cliff path and through the dark forest to the edge of the river Talk to the Old lady and escort her through the woods Now who else did we upset
The guy in the clearing seems to have cleared off so the Ferryman would be next on our way Use the pole on the raft and go talk to him He rsquo s happy with you now and will let you borrow his ferry anytime Mmm maybe we should think about how poor Mumsie is going to get to town to do the shopping thatpoleshould go back on the cart Back to the house and use thepoleon the cart Lucky you picked that piece of springyvineit tied thepoleback on perfectly

FALLOUT In this walkthrough I will try to cover the essentials for completing FALLOUT along with the quests and actions determined by and determining the plot
Well you start off by choosing your character
The pre created characters pretty suck though so I recommend you create your own hero
I completed the game with this one Strength Perception Endurance Charisma Inelligence Agility Luck Traits Finesse and Gifted
Primary skills Energy Weapons Melee Weapons and Lockpicks
This character had no problems fighting monsters and frankly speaking that was a cakewalk
SECTION I
Vault Cave Entrance
Search the corpse near the vault entrance and equip yourself
Kill all rats in the area there are twenty of them
That should give you experience points
In most cases you will get hurt by the rats
At this point in the game it's good because you get a chance to use your First Aid and Doctor skills
While your character is level do it whenever you can as it earns you experience
Now it's time for the wastes
The exit from the caves is in its western part
Once you're out head for the Vault
SECTION II
Shady Sands
On your way to another vault you will eventually discover another green circle on the map
That's the village of Shady Sands
Drop in
First of all holster your weapon
Most of the NPCs will not conversate with you until you do
Talk to Seth the guard at the gate
He will tell you of the Radscorpions' problem and offer to take you to Radscorpion caves
SECTION III
Radscorpion caves
This area is pretty straightforward
Just kill all of the Radscorpions and be sure to collect at least one of their tails
Exit the caves
SECTION IV
Shady Sands revisited
Later on you will need a rope
Seth has one
Trade it for something you don't actually need Radscorpion tails for example
Visit local healer and give him a Radscorpion tail for the antidote and some experience
Find the traveling merchant he's in the house near the village gate the one in blue pants and ask him about Junktown and Hub
They will appear on your world map
Exit the village
SECTION V Vault
Descent into the vault find the elevator shaft and use the rope on it
You will gain access to Vault levels and
Make your way to level and head for the south eastern corner
There you will get some experience and will be informed that you won't get the water chip here
Exit the vault
Head for Junktown
SECTION VI
Junktown
Find Killian Darkwater the mayor of Junktown
Talk to him
In the middle of the conversation there will be the assassination attempt on Darkwater
Kill the assassin and get back to chatting with Killian
He will propose you to talk the confession out of Gizmo local maphia boss
Accept his proosal and visit Gizmo
Talk to him about the failed assassination attempt and offer yourself as the man for the job
Then Gizmo will confess that he wants Darkwater's head
It's just what you need
Return to Killian and give him the tape with Gizmo's confession
Accept his offer to participate in Gizmo's accusal
Of course Gizmo will fight and of course you will have to kill him and Izo his bodyguard
After you're done talk to the guard captain
He has another task for you
You are to bust Skulz the gang that originally worked for Gizmo
Visit Scum Pitt at and you will see the bartender killing the Skulz member
Steal the urn on the bar and show it to Vinnie Skulz leader
He c
an be found in the back room of Crash House
Vinnie will accept you in his gang and offer you to take a part in the bartender's murder
At this point you can either join him right away or run for the guard captain
In any case once you are in the bar kill all the Skulz members and return the urn to the bartender
That's it
Leave Junktown for Hub
On your way out you may want to help Philip out with the dog that doesn't let him in his apartment
You can plainly kill it no dog no problem but better give it an iguana on a stick it's worth more experience
SECTION VII
Hub
There is much to explore in Hub
I'll just cover some of the more interesting things
First the weapons merchant in Old Town has the most powerful melee weapon in the game the super sledge
To get it browse his selection and then ask for something that has more punch
Next you might want to find out the cause of the trading caravans disappearing talk to merchants they will complain about it eventually along with it you will be informed of Necropolis Boneyard and Brotherhood of Steel locations
Talk to Butch the leader of Far Go Traders he will ensign you on a job of finding the lost caravans
Ask him about the Death Claw then go talk to Beth she runs the weapons shop here in Hub
After you do it visit some madman in Old Town he's always by the house in which Harold the mutant lives
The madman will refuse to help you until you talk to Harold
Then he will take you to the Death Claw cave
Take it out
If you have difficulties let it live for now and return here after you visit Necropolis
In the cave you will find a dying mutant who will give you the holodisc
Show it to Butch for some money
Then talk to the guy who runs FLC
He will advise you to seek work with Dekker the underground leader
Go to the night club which is across the street and persuade Kayne to let you in
Dekker will offer to dispose of a merchant who lives in the Heights
Accept and frame Dekker telling the Sheriff about the job
You will be asked to join the Dekker's arrest
Agree when you are ready and kill Dekker and all of his gang
The Sheriff and the deputy are not much of assistance
Now that's a good place to store your supplies
Don't forget to visit the police station for the rest of your reward
You may also wish to join the thieves' circle located in the basement of one of the houses in Old Town
Talk to their leader he will ask you to steal the necklace from the merchant living in the Heights it seems that everyone has a knife into the poor guy
To enter the merchant's house you will need to wait till it's dark and SNEAK into it during the guards change
There find the chest containing the necklace grab it and get out
When you give it to the thieves' circle leader you will be presented with electronic lockpicks
In Old Town there is a group of thugs holding a Brotherhood of Steel initiate as a prisoner
Kill them the nasty one's armed with a combat shotgun and release the prisoner
Talk to the water merchants they can be found in the southern part of Hub about the water chip
Refuse their offer to supply your vault with water for days you have plenty of time
What is more important they will tell you that the ghouls of Necropolis refused to trade with them
That means they have a stabile source of water
Could this be a water chip
There is an opportunity for you to take a job of guarding the caravans
It pays though not much and usually it's worth some experience
But I for myself consider that job a waste of time
Now it's time to return to Shady Sands
Something's happening there
SECTION VIII
Shady Sands revisited
Seth will tell you that Tandi the daughter of the village elder was kidnapped by Khans a group of raiders
Go talk to the elder
He will give you the quest to return Tandi a spear and his blessings
Now visit Khans
SECTION IX
Raiders
Go straight to Garl the Khans leader
Tell him that you're taking the girl and challenge him
You will fight bare handed
Kill him
If you aren't strong enough the best tactic is to strike for his legs and once he's down for his eyes
After you defeat Garl take Tandi to her father for the reward and return here
You are not finished with the raiders yet
Kill 'em all
Now you are finished
Head for Necropolis
SECTION X Necropolis
You will enter Necropolis in the area called the Hotel
Your task is to get to the Watershed using the sewers
Eventually you will encounter the group of peaceful ghouls who live underground
Talk to their leader and share your problems with him
You will know that they do have a water chip in Necropolis and are using it because their water pump is broken
Agree to find the parts for the water pump and fix it
In the center of Necropolis lives Set the head of the city
He is sicko and will get killed later on in the game by the invading super mutants so why not kill him now
Besides he has some quite valuable items
Before you kill him he may tell you that a bunch of huge mutants is causing him problems at the Watershed
Go there
You will see yes you guessed it a bunch of huge mutants
Find their boss Harry
He will talk to you
You will get two options agree to follow him to the Lieutenant and it will be very very hard for you to survive there or refuse whichwill cause Harry to attack you
He has a laser rifle so make sure he dies fast
Other super mutants will also attack you
One of them is armed with a flamer and that makes him even more dangerous than Harry
After you dispose of them descent to the sewers where Larry the super mutant stood
There you will find some junk parts
Return with them to the peaceful ghoul and he will give you three books on electronics
Go back to the house where you encountered Harry and REPAIR the water pump
Descent into the sewers in the southern part of the house
There is a vault here
Find the water chip and leave Necropolis for the Brotherhood os Steel
SECTION XI
Brotherhood of Steel
Talk to the guards
One of them will charge you with the quest to bring them something from the Ancient Order AKA Glow
Accept the quest and leave the hospitable Brotherhood
Before you go to the Ancient Order it would not hurt to wander into Boneyard
SECTION XII
Boneyard
Boneyard consists of four main parts the downtown where the Blades reside Boneyard Adytum the library home for the Followers of the Apocalypse and the fortress of the Gun Runners
Go to Adytum and talk to Miles their chemist and Zimmerman their mayor
Zimmerman wants the leader of the Blades dead blaming her for the death of his son and Miles wants you to get hime the parts to fix the hydroponic farm
Go to the night club where the Blades are
Talk to their leader
She will prove her innocense by giving you the holodisc with the Regulators transmission
Hmm it's obvious that the Regulators are much more than just the guards for Adytum
Head back to Zimmerman and show him the disc
He will get killed and you will get a full scale war with the Regulators
You have no choice but to kill them
Now visit Nicole the founder of the Followers of the Apocalypse
She will tell you to find out what is happenng in the Cathedral
She is sure something sinister is going on there
Let her know you will look into it
Now for the Gun Runners
To get to them one has to deal with the Death Claws
Once you entered the Gun Runners fortress talk to Gabriel their leader
and agree to destroy all Death Claws so the Gun Runners could move out
Gabriel isn't very happy with the situation in Boneyard his only clients are the Regulators and he cannot move out because of the Death Claws
Return to where you saw the Death Claws kill them on the surface and proceed to the basement
There you will find the Mother Death Claw and the eggs
Take care of them and return to Gabriel
He will decide not to move out as you eliminated both the Death Claws and the Regulators
Pick up the junk parts lying where the Death Claws were and take them to Miles then to Smitty and then again to Miles
That's it
Leave Boneyard and head for the Glow
Make sure you have a rope and two packs of Rad X in your inventory
SECTION XIII
The Glow
Stop in the square next to the Glow and take Rad X until your radiation resistance is
Without it you might get fried
Now go to the Crater find a beam and tie your rope around it
Descent to the crater via the rope
Your taks here is simple
All you need to do is find the corpse of the paladin the one in power armor and get the holodisc from him
He is lying somewhere on the first level
But the Glow is much more interesting than that
In total you will need to collect three access cards which will give you access to different elevators REPAIR the power generators on level six get to level five dispose of the sentry robots and collect the stuff
There is also a very advanced computer from which you may know what are the super mutants and where they come from
Return to the Brotherhood
SECTION XIV
Brotherhood of Steel revisited
Now the astonished guards will let you in
On the first level make sure to visit the trainig facility and talk to the paladin there
He will thank you for saving the initiate in Hub and offer you an item of your choosing as a reward
I recomment taking the power armor
Get it from Michael the guy in combat armor near the supply room
On the second third floors there are a workshop a library and a medic who can make operations permanently increasing your stats
In the workshop you may talk to the guy who's repairing a suit of power armor
If you get him a systolic motivator from Michael or steal one from Rhombus the head paladin and REPAIR that armor you can have it but do you really need it if you already have one
On the fourth level the Council of the Elders and the leader of the Brotherhood are
Talk to them
They will confess that there are rumors about some army from north and ask you to investigate the northern regions
Accept the quest and leave the Brotherhood
It
will be useful now to visit Boneyard Adytum
SECTION XV
Boneyard revisited
When you're there go talk to Miles about your power armor
He will ask you to bring him some magazines on chemistry from the librarian in Hub
Once you're back he will make your armor even more powerful
By this time you should have a plasma rifle
Bring it to Smitty and he will upgrade it to Turbo Plasma Rifle the one and true energy weapon nearly as good as an alien blaster which doesn't look so good
Now you're ready to take on the military base which is situated in the north western corner of your world map
SECTION XVI
Vault
Aren't we forgetting something
Ahh yes
The chip
By this time you should have at least thirty days before the deadline which is more than enough to get to Vault from any point on your world map
Well bring the chip back to your vault Overseer
He will get worried about the mutants and ask you no less than to destroy the source of the mutations and the mutants leader
Depart for the military base
SECTION XVII
The Military Base
Once you find the military base and see the guards you may return to the Brotherhood of Steel and persuade the Council of the Elders to assign three paladins to help you but since they don't follow you into the base building anyway that would be a waste of time
So dispose of the guards
Take a radio from one of them scream in it that you're being attacked by the unknown enemy
You will get some experience for that
Enter the building
The military base itself is pretty straightforward
Just kill everything that moves you have no friends here
As for the force fields plainly go through the red ones you will take some damage but no much and REPAIR the force field emitters for the green ones
On the final level you will encounter the Lieutenant and VanHaagen the guy from the Cathedral
Yes you can kill them too
On that very level find the room with lots of computers and exploding technicians
You can prevent them from exploding by shooting them
Use your SCIENCE skill on the main computer and initiate self destruct sequence
Get out of the base before it blows up
Now what was that guy from the Cathedral doing there
SECTION XVIII
The Cathedral
In the Cathedral you will be accompanied by the group of Followers scouts
Find the woman Nicole told you about and tell her quot red rider quot
She will tell you about the secret door the key to which only Morheus has
Find Morpheus take stairs up
In any case it will all end up by fighting him and the Nightkins
Take the key from Morpheus' body get back to the ground floor open the secret door and descent
In the basement find the strange wall near the bookcases whick is marked on your automap as a passage
Eventually it will open and you will encounter another servant of the cult
The simplest way to deal with him is to kill him
Behind the secret passage is a vault entrance
From there make your way to the third level find another secret passage and enter the corridor of flesh
You will get damage advancing this passage and may finally have your eyes poked with some bone or alike
In that case use your DOCTOR skill to restore your vision before the battle with the Master
Come close to the Master and he will talk to you
Don't take his offer to join him
He will attack
Take cover behind one of the columns and shoot him periodically with your turbo plasma rifle
It'll take about from four to six shots
Once per three turns the corridor will spawn a super mutant but when you kill the Master it'll be over
The Master's death initiates self destruct sequence on the nuclear warhe ad that's on the fourth level
Escape the Cathedral and that's it you've completed Fallout GAME BOOMERS hints cheats and walkthroughs

This can be easier to follow and allows you to makes annotations
MY VIEW ON WALKTHROUGHS I've completed this particular game both with and without the help of a walkthrough or guide and found that although it may have been more exciting and nerve racking without one it took a long time and I found myself getting bad ratings where I was so slow and unconfident
I often find this with similar games and because of it I usually prefer to play with the help of some form of guide
However I'm sure I am not alone in believing that many nearly all in fact walkthrough guides are either too vague or do not help with certain important aspects of a game ie finding non mandatory items like health or explaining exactly when something is going to happen
I have decided to try to provide gamers with detailed guides which describe not only how to complete the game but how to complete it comfortably and with style
Before scrolling down to crack on with the game guide I really advise you read Section ldquo Preparing for the Game rdquo
It rsquo s not that long and it just lays out a few points which you really need to bear in mind if you want good ratings and a confident exciting game
If you have any suggestions for improvements of this guide or know of any points which I have missed or which are incorrect please do not hesitate to email me at emma north hotmail com
Similarly if you have the answers to any of the unanswered questions I may raise in part please email me
This is much appreciated
I do also appreciate all of you who contact me just to let me know that they found my guide useful
This is a big boost for me and I hope I can carry on being of use
If there is a game you would like help with or a walkthrough for let me know and you never know but I may be able to help

Here is my recommended walkthrough
I highly advise complete the tutorial first this won rsquo t take much of your time and will follow onto the game
However please note that this does not cover many important aspects of the game which I think it should but nonetheless it doesn rsquo t so you will need to learn to pick up things as you play
One point to take notice of is the fact that I DON rsquo T tell you what NOT to do during the walkthrough itself
For this check the points guide at the start of each scene description which I have used to show you what has negative effects on you
Good luck
THE MURDER Playable Characters Lucas Bonus Points N A Location Doc rsquo s Diner Points Removing body Sweeping blood Hiding knife Removing blood from your body Getting coin Eating Drinking Playingjukebox Leaving diner after paying Leaving with a cab Leaving with the subway Looking out of window in restroom Using phone Walking behind counter Talking to man with hat Talking to waitress Talking to cop Leaving without paying Note this chapter is the only one you will play if you are playing a demo version
If you are I hope you go out and buy the damn thing you won rsquo t regret it
The game begins with a cutscene which introduces you to your first character and then you rsquo ll see a man urinating
He washes his hands casually and doesn rsquo t notice you sitting on a toilet carving symbols into your arms
His own body hides you from the mirror as you walk up behind him in a trance to stab and kill him
Your mental status goes from neutral to depressed as you realise what you rsquo ve done
You rsquo ll then be in control of Lucas
You will have to complete the tasks here reasonably quickly as the police officer will visit the restroom and you need to be gone before he does
You rsquo ll need to cover your tracks and reduce the evidence
Start by dragging the body into the toilet
You should begin to learn how you do things in the game when symbols appear and what they mean
Next take the mop by the cubical you were in and clean up the blood stains you will need to repeatedly push the Right Analogue Stick up to do this
There is a knife on the floor near the urinals
Pick this up to get rid of it
Lastly wash your hands at the right hand sink the other is out of order
Walk towards the vending machine near the door and use it to notice it's broken
However do the same thing again and you will hit the machine
Repeat this motion until a coin drops out which you should take before leaving the restroom
Walk to your table the second one on the right and sit down
Eat some food drink something from the glass and try to drink from the coffee mug there are two different drink icons to do this to see that you could have been with someone at your table
Then look at your bill and pay at your table
Move to the jukebox near the door and use the coin to play a track
Exit the diner and leave the city using either the cab or the subway depending on which you find first
INVESTIGATION Playable Characters Carla Tyler Bonus Points N A Location Doc rsquo s Diner Points Drinking coffee both Talking to the men at the bar both Seeing blood outside Carla Getting near the cab Carla Finding the book Putting the jukebox on Talking with homeless guy both Using urinal Tyler The cutscene which follows will explain that Tyler is having problems so listen to this
Then when you take over as Carla select the little question mark icon to see that she too has issues before entering the diner
Let Carla talk to the cop and you will need to decide what to talk about
It isn rsquo t too critical as most of what is said will be said one way or another but ask him about the waitress last to get most out of him and he rsquo ll tell you to take it easy with her
This is a good idea as being sensitive will make her tell you as much as possible
I know it seems like getting Lucas into trouble but it's needed for the story
Go over to her when you finish
After speaking with her get up and go behind the counter to drink some coffee
You can switch with Tyler and make him do the same
You may find this process difficult but it rsquo s really easy if you follow the movements on the icon while holding the stick forward and gently pulling it to the side
You rsquo ll later need to use this type of action again so get practice
Talk to the guys at the bar with both Carla and Tyler and then go to the table where Lucas was sitting
Examine everything possible with each character and you will get another officer to examine the Shakespeare book on the floor after
Now enter the restroom and let Carla investigate the blood on the floor
Take each character in turn into the cubical which Lucas was in
Carla will be able to examine the blood and a hole on the floor and Tyler will flush the toilet
Either character may find the knife here but its location is random and if not then let Carla look out of the window where she may find it
If not Tyler should search the bin or the other toilet
The knife will be in one of these five locations
When you find the knife go back out and talk to the guys at the bar again
Then have one of your character rsquo s talk to the other and at some point in the conversation select leave
Outside examine the bloody footprints in the snow
Then head to the car to finish the scene
THE DAY AFTER Playable Characters Lucas Bonus Points Location Lucas rsquo Apartment Points Using the toilet Taking a shower Putting music on Taking medicine Using bandages Officer leaves Drinking milk Looking at a photo on the desk Reading the newspaper at the door WatchingTV Seeing mirror reflection Lucas awakes with the misconception that it was all a dream although his stained sheets and carved arms soon prove otherwise
You will have to complete certain tasks reasonably quickly as a police officer will call and you will need to explain that you were the one who the neighbours heard screaming as you cut yourself with some glass and that it's no problem if he takes a look inside
He doesn rsquo t stay long but you must have pulled your sheets over washed dressed and put your shirt in the washing machine first as the walkthrough will explain so do these tasks first
I have the tasks in order below as to what rsquo s most important so work quickly and follow my order
Also when the officer does arrive you really should try to succeed in the mini game as failing will cause trouble later
Stand up when you have control again and take the medicine which is on your bedside table
Look at your bed and then hide the blood under the sheets
Head out of your bedroom and answer the phone when it rings to speak to your brother
After the call pick up your shirt near the pillar to see a reminder of the night before
Go again to pick this up and go through the side door to your bathroom
Now use the toilet and take a shower to clean up after
Open the medicine cabinet above the sink and use the bandages
Close the cabinet for another harsh reminder
Now head back to your bedroom and take some clothes out of the wardrobe to put them on
Head back into the living room and find a key on the table which you should take
Also look in the fridge and drink the milk which you rsquo ll find
There is your first bonus card in one of the kitchen cupboards
Take it for five bonus points
Be sure not to drink the alcohol you keep under the counter as you have taken medicine and drinking will kill you
But feel free to put music on before you leave
Once the policeman has been and gone make sure you rsquo re ready and leave the apartment to meet your brother
Now you have a choice as to which scene you play next
It doesn rsquo t matter too much but I have chosen to continue with Lucas for now
Refer down if you change to Carla and return back for Lucas rsquo scene later

At the end he'll offer you a cross
Accept it since it's an extra life

After the vision he actually does fall
You need to save him
Run forward jump into the water and work your way through the mini games to save him and bring him to surface

Wait until you have counted to three before each pump and you should save him in time
The police officer recognises you but doesn rsquo t arrest you

Enter the office after
Hang up your coat and go out to join Carla at one of the desks
You can check your email first if you like there rsquo s one from Sam there
After you find out all you need to know about the forensic results head back to your office and use your computer to check your mail
The mysterious email ldquo it rsquo s happened before rdquo is interesting
After emails go across to the third icon on you computer main screen to search the police database
Scroll up for the word ldquo Kirsten rdquo to find that it rsquo s a classified entry
Then leave your computer to end the scene

Markus and his friends decide to go to a forbidden area ndash Hanger
But soon after they leave Young Lucas will have a vision about a fire and goes to rescue his brother and his friends
Walk to the north eastern part of the map and climb the fence where it rsquo s covered by gauze
To do this push the stick in the direction it tells you and then spin it upward
This will alternate before you need to just push it forward at the top
After that walk straight ahead being sure not to be seen
You rsquo ll need to move along the fence ahead moving towards the left until you find a gap in the fence
Crawl through this gap
From here on it gets a bit harder
Move right behind the blockage and move forward behind another lot of crates
Wait here until a truck passes by and then walk up to the side of it
Hanger b is straight ahead of you with a guard standing next to it and another guard stood by the hanger to the right
When you see the truck here move up to it and wait close until it passes leaving you in between the two hangers
When it passes go straight forward into the gap between the hangers
You won't be seen if you do this correctly
Enter the hangar on the left through the gap at the end of the walkway
Inside you will tell Markus leave and that you rsquo ll look for the rest
It is possible to get all the boys out in time but it isn rsquo t easy and depends on whether or not you got the mini game right
There rsquo s one lad upstairs at the end of the platform the stairs are near the front of the hanger one in the plane near these stairs and one at the back of the hanger in a crate

Turn the on light nearby before opening the gate
What you need to do now is control Carla by holding the left and right mouse button and keep her breath under control by pressing left right left etc
when the thing in the bar moves
Straight ahead you'll see that big cases are blocking the path
Go to the valve on the right and use it to move the first lot
Next use the valve on the left followed by the valve on the right to clear a path
You'll now find a terminal but the power will shut down
It rsquo s fairly simple to find the controls simply go through the gap on the left and turn the valve to the right before doing the same with the valve down the left
This will now reveal the power controls which you should go and use
In this little walkway you rsquo ll also be able to pick up some files starting with k which you should do before returning back to the terminal
This tape is not the right tape not the right year
You would find several of these tapes but I will now direct you to the right one
Now from this room turn to the other side of the room and turn the left valve here the one just next to terminal
Move forward and turn the valve on the left
Come back out and turn the valve you turned previously and then move over to the valve on the right hand side to turn this
Again move through and turn the valve you come to
This will reveal a walkway where you will be able to take the right tape off a high shelf
However there rsquo s not much to see on it when you put it in the terminal
Just that a Robert Mitchell led the investigation Note If you have trouble finding the tape your best bet is to try anything or restart the scene and follow the instructions steadily again
DEBRIEFING TYLER Playable Characters Tyler Bonus Points Location Police Station Points Finding paper in book Giving the book Please note that there are two chapters with this name so don rsquo t get confused

After talking go to leave and he rsquo ll offer help
He'll give an example book and tell you to find a book that looks like it
Firstly take the book to the desk to look at it under the magnifier
You'll see it's written by quot De Gruttola quot
Walk up the stairs and look at the book here
You'll find out De Gruttola has the number
Now go back down and look at the book on the table behind the man
Book is on the third level and that as the author begins with ldquo d rdquo it is in the white part of the level
Go there and find the book
Give the book to the man and ask about clients
Then ask him about the book
He rsquo ll be of little use anyway

Simple I find this one tricky though as it can be hard to see the lights on the mini game

Now switch to Tyler select the question mark icon to hear him think and then use the computer
Check the web and look at the quot World quot tab
He'll realise that the piece of paper is from some stock piles
Then call Carla about this
Carla will answer and ask you to fax it

Switch back to Carla and watch TV until someone rings the door bell
Go and open the door to meet Tommy your neighbour who has brought some wine
Get glasses out of one of the kitchen cupboards and put them down on the table
Sit down and have a chat with Tommy
After some talking Tommy will show some tarot cards
You have no choice but to sit through this even though this ends up very bad and puts Carla in an awful mood
If you faxed the bookmark Tommy will notice it on his way out
He says you can trace the bank which printed it by looking at the watermark
Call Tyler to tell him
Switch to Tyler after the call and take the bookmark out of the fax machine
Put it on the desk sit down and switch on the lamp
Now look at the bookmark again but this time with the lamp
Voila we find the watermark
You can now decide who goes to the bank
I chose Carla by saying lsquo no rsquo when Tyler asked if he should go but it rsquo s up to you as to who you prefer

Lucas takes his time about things so after picking that up move to the other side of your desk and take the Shakespeare book off the mini computer desk to hide that as well
If you get time sit back down and collect the bonus card out of the right hand draw
You won rsquo t have time for much else before she enters
Carla will enter as the vision implied and will ask a few questions
First ask her what the subject is as this option doesn rsquo t arouse suspicion
Then I rsquo d try to get the mini games right as each time you do you rsquo ll read Carla rsquo s mind which will help you decide what to say
Also get these wrong will result in the appearance of those annoying bugs
I advise telling the truth to avoid creating suspicion
After a few questions you'll ask if you can go to the toilet
You'll now switch to Carla
While Lucas is in the toilet pick up the pen on the desk and the torn paper in the left hand draw
Look at the photo there too if you like

What you rsquo ve done in the game will affect what you now can link but two you can always link are the fingerprints on the pen on the computer with the list of fingerprints on Tyler rsquo s desk and the two Shakespeare books
Martin will come in to tell you about the day at the lake

Other things you could link should be fairly obvious but will depend on what you rsquo ve done in the game

Follow this forward until you have a vision about being arrested
After deciding to take another route turn around find a nearby fence and climb over it
I found this difficult at first but at the top when you need to climb over move the stick forward and then left to get over
After climbing this fence you rsquo ll probably tackle the next one with more ease
When you rsquo re over the other side you rsquo ll see police standing around
Move forward to trigger the clip and watch the screen which appears at the top
Wait until they aren rsquo t looking directly your way and then test your luck in running across to the other side
When you get there you rsquo ll need to climb up a pipe to reach a ridge
Move along this quickly
You rsquo ll need to do a few mini games on the way but after each one continue to move across swiftly
At the end climb down the pipe
Climb over the fence here to see Tiffany rsquo s house
The first window is Tiffany rsquo s bedroom but this is closed so if you like you can move onto the next one and try to get in
You rsquo ll be unsuccessful so head over to a pile of sticks and bricks to pick up a brick
Use this to help open the window and then climb inside
Lay down on the bed for a few seconds to make Lucas a little happier and then stand back up again
You rsquo ll get a mini game which winning will give you a vision of Tyler looking under Tiffany rsquo s bed
Don rsquo t worry too much if you fail
Now head out into the kitchen to get some food out of the cupboard and a drink and a sandwich from the fridge
Take a bonus card out of another cupboard here and then head to the lounge to watch some TV

Now walk to her bathroom and wander around to find an extra life

Take breaks when she suggests it and only move again when she says it rsquo s safe to do so
She rsquo ll hold her breathe when she needs to as well
It rsquo s pretty easy although you should also note that if you see a guy before she does then you rsquo ve gone the wrong way so turn back and turn off somewhere but it rsquo s pretty easy to find where you rsquo re going

The real room is at the end of the hall so continue the way Carla just ran and look at the door on the opposite side with R
This should read

You rsquo ll need to do something similar to what you do with Carla rsquo s breathing although this is a bit harder
Take it steady and try not to fall as this will seriously affect your mood as it will kill you

Repeat this or develop your own tactics to get across
When you make it across head around Tiffany and free her
However the oracle will now appear and you rsquo ll both fall
CHILD rsquo S PLAY Playable Characters Young Lucas Young Markus Bonus Points None Location Military Base Points None After you hear the Myan rsquo s talking about you you rsquo ll wake up in your dream

Then head out through the window
Just stay out of the light and you rsquo ll be fine at this point although this may be easier said than done
You need to follow the path on your mini map
Keep rotating the camera with L and R to check the route of the lights
Head around the corner in front of you as soon as the light moves past to the right and stay close to the building
You rsquo ll then see some soldiers up ahead
When you see them instead of just walking past them you rsquo ll need to move across carefully to the other side near a giant rock away from the building you rsquo re up against
Move forward close to this huge rock
Next move behind a structure nearby so as to keep as far away from the soldiers as possible
Keep moving and you rsquo ll see a soldier and will need to hide
Head over to a car you should see on the screen in between two buildings
Hide behind this until the soldier has passed
Check the map and continue the way you needed to go
Soon Lucas and Markus will split up
When this happens move back in the direction you just came and near the corner of the building an explanation mark should appear as an action
Do this to throw a stone and the guard will turn around to investigate
Carefully let Markus go first being sure not to get seen in the light
Refer to the map to see where to head
You rsquo ll end up between two buildings when you rsquo ll need to wait for your brother
Now take Lucas there and continue your route
Move forward and you rsquo ll meet another guard
Markus will tell you that he rsquo ll distract the guard while you climb the pole next to him
With Markus you rsquo ll need to go back in the opposite direction and move around the building next to him into the next building gap
There will be a barrel here which you should kick
With Lucas head up to the pole and begin to move along the wires
However you rsquo ll need to be very careful to avoid the lights which will still highlight you when you rsquo re up here
It rsquo s very tight but it is possible if you time it carefully
When you reach the other side climb down and use the map to follow the route to the door
Use the controls to get inside

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
ByDan Kennedy An adventure classic to some an incomprehensible mess to others ndash Faust or Seven Games of the Soul at least has the ability to elicit strong reactions from its players
Faust dares to structure its story around the mature concepts of sin redemption and the practicalities of our existence that tend to blur the lines between good and evil As Marcellus Faust you are stricken with the task of surveying the sordid lives of a number of inhabitants of a surreal early thcentury amusement park Mephisto a gregarious devil tempter straight out of the Faust legend is your tour guide as you visit different locations and time period in the park rsquo s history in order to judge the relative ldquo evilness rdquo of each character on trial
Lovers of the game rave about the mature storyline the vivid character studies the dazzling graphics and the strong blues and jazz soundtrack Those who hate the game see it as a pretentious nonsensical story with poor production values and a frustrating unresolved ending
In the end like everything else the truth lies somewhere between the two extremes ndash Faust is a challenging intriguing game with some fairly major flaws Consider the following The story is daring and original but is difficult to penetrate until much of the game has been played Key dialogue moments are sometimes unexpectedly triggered and whip past in the blink of an eye Unfortunately in this linear story driven game that many players are unlikely to play a second time the plot is difficult to grasp the first time through
The player rsquo s character Marcellus Faust begins the game purely as an observer and as such we learn little about him or his motives Yet by the end of the game Faust has becomes a central character in the story This lack of character development unlike the much more realized Mephisto character hinders the player from being truly affected by the game rsquo s climactic moments There are a number of production issues including inconsistent cursor usage misplayed graphics incorrectly triggered voice passages and overlapping hotspots
The puzzles range from original and fun to tedious and frustrating Some brilliantly conceived puzzles are severely hampered by poor interface design and positioning issues that punish players even after they correctly deduce solutions In addition many puzzle solutions automatically trigger cut scenes and setting changes wresting control of the pace of the game from the player
The developers should be lauded for assembling an original and eclectic soundtrack In practice however the music seemed to loop too quickly perhaps the vocals on some of the tracks accentuate the looping and the music occasionally drowns out the character dialogue
Your ultimate enjoyment of the game will likely be directly related to the appeal of the central story and the importance you place on the issues listed above
The game begins with a conversation between Gabriel and Peter you know those ldquo heaven rdquo guys discussing what rsquo s going to happen down below
The discussion is difficult to follow and hard to hear ndash get used to it Next up is the amusement park rsquo s creator Theodore More who introduces the setting of the game Dreamland a glorious amusement park of delights and horrors established in has gradually faded into obscurity and is now closed Finally we switch locations to the park itself where Mephistopheles ndash an extremely expressive devil explains to Faust what he and ldquo the man upstairs rdquo need our confused protagonist to do
The player is next directed to the menu screen which comes up after each of the seven chapters of the game is completed The two arrows at the top of the screen allow you to scroll through the seven chapters but the game restricts you to playing them in order The left side of the menu page displays familiar commands including Load Save Options and Exit note that the game also has an automatic save feature which preserves your current progress in the game under your ldquo login rdquo name without having to manually save it
The right side of the menu allows you to view the ldquo Stars rdquo of each chapter review cut scenes previously seen ldquo Movies rdquo play all of the ldquo Music rdquo in the game check your progress through the game via a ldquo Status rdquo window lame and experience some of the park rsquo s ldquo Attractions rdquo Note there really isn rsquo t any point in visiting the ldquo attractions rdquo yet since you will encounter them during gameplay
Once you complete a chapter entries in ldquo Pact rdquo and ldquo Theodore rsquo s Notebook rdquo are added caution you may have to scroll back through the chapter titles at the top of the screen to gain access to them
The notebook in particular is invaluable since it supplies some desperately needed context to the stories The Evidence area is not accessible with the cursor
The first chapter ldquo Twice as Bad rdquo begins with a short introduction by Mephisto that mentions the balancing act all couples must strive to maintain The gameplay begins in November near a patio set located between several characters rsquo homes at the park Feel free to wander around but the action for the first story takes place within the Twins rsquo trailer located directly in front of you Ignore the tent to the left and the small shack to the right and proceed into the trailer note the ldquo walking feet rdquo icon indicates movement is possible in any given direction
Inside the trailer turn to your left and click on the left sink note the grabbing hand cursor containing a metal strainer The click triggers a cut scene showing attached Siamese twins collecting coins that have fallen from the pockets of roller coaster riders They both appear to have a keen interest in money and one twin seems dominant over the other Once the scene has ended right click to bring up the menu link and your inventory and note that the strainer is now present in your inventory
Mouse over the cabinet below the sinks and note the solid hand cursor indicating manipulation is possible Click open the cabinet doors and note the eyeglasses icon on the empty space inside Clicking here triggers an audio passage in which one twin accuses the other Lilly of wasting money on food The drawers to the right of the cabinet can each be opened but there isn rsquo t anything inside them
Pan to your right until the trailer rsquo s stove comes into view Click on the front of the stove for a close up and note the slightly right pointing hand cursor over the ashes in the stove indicating another object can be used here Spot the iron shovel hanging to the right of the stove and pick it up Now right click to open your inventory grab the shovel and click on one of the piles of ash in the stove We now own a shovel filled with ash ndash but what do we do with it Anyone have an icy sidewalk
To sift through the ash grab the strainer from your inventory it will appear in the centre of the screen if you are still in the stove close up view grab the shovel and click on the strainer to dump the ash in Now click and hold the left mouse button down and shake the strainer around to sift out the ash When completed the strainer will be empty Repeat this process two more times for the two remaining piles of ash in the stove After the last pile is sifted away note the small white object in the strainer ndash it is a tooth Click to grab it and we get a short scene of one of the twins holding a skull Not good times Bad times
Before backing away from the stove note the metal key located inside the now mostly empty stove Pick up the key and back away from the stove close up to accomplish this find the eyeglasses icon along the bottom of the screen and click
You will find a chalkboard on the wall to the left of the stove ndash click on it to see the details of loans made by the twins to others at the park Back away and click on the shelf below the chalkboard In the open drawer click on the green book on the left and listen as the ladies explain their love of accounting lessons Back away and click on the white paper to the right It seems that a gentleman named Hannibal is in deep debt with the twins ndash primarily because both ladies are having romantic dreams about him
Back away and walk one step further into the trailer Turn to your left and click on each of the two mirrors on the bureau ndash you will get a special message from Mephisto each time Pan over to the right and click on the wardrobe ndash the close up view shows two keyholes that must be filled before we can gain entry Back away turn to the left a bit and find the small framed picture of a man on the left side of the bed Clicking on it reveals that Lilly carries a torch for Hannibal Now click on the small drawer located directly below the picture Inside you rsquo ll find a small brass key ndash take it and close the drawer
Take another step into the trailer turn to your left and click on the gramophone located to the right of the bureau We watch a cut scene involving Mephisto offering riches to each of the twins separately in exchange for giving up Hannibal forever The domineering one takes the money but Lilly turns it down The last moment shows Mephisto separating the twins with some sort of otherworldly table saw
Click twice on the lamp located on the right side of the bureau to trigger a short movie of Hannibal trying to pay back some of his debt with romance and the tacky lamp we also learn that the aggressive twin rsquo s name is Jody Find the hairbrush near the centre of the bureau rsquo s top surface to hear a familiar sisterly argument between the twins
Pan around to face the twins rsquo bed and click on the circular framed picture of Hannibal located on the far side of the bed Apparently Jody was also quite taken with the dead beat Hannibal Clicking on the bed itself also trigger another conversation between the twins
Pan to the left and enter the trailer rsquo s bathroom you rsquo ll be seeing many bathrooms in this game Turn to your right and try playing with the taps on the sink ndash the left one works but the right one does not Turn around and face the two person toilet ndash feel free to lift the seat to take a peek inside don rsquo t worry it rsquo s empty
Click on the top of the tank located above the seat to open it up and then click on the object partially hidden in the left side of the tank The object is a knife and touching it triggers a short scene showing one of the twins holding up the knife as if to strike someone
Now that we rsquo ve explored the trailer time to attack that locked closet Walk back into the main room several steps turn to your left and click on the wardrobe In the close up view grab the brass key from your inventory and click on the left keyhole the hotspot can be a bit tricky to find ndash look for the key to ldquo light up rdquo when properly positioned Next grab the burnt key from the stove and click on the right keyhole
The doors open revealing hanging clothes Click and hold the left button of the mouse and shift the clothes over to the left and right by moving the mouse This will expose a wall safe at the back of the closet Clicking on the safe yields a close up and a voice passage from Jody who mentions ldquo All our wealth on this of all days hellip rdquo The key phrase here is ldquo all our wealth rdquo ndash you must add up all of the money coming to the twins from their various debtors the three totals on the chalk board and must be added to Hannibal rsquo s current debt as written on the paper in the shelf below the chalk board to get a grand total of
Click and hold on the safe rsquo s combination dial and turn the arrow to ldquo rdquo ldquo rdquo and ldquo rdquo in that order note that it doesn rsquo t matter which direction you turn the dial in The safe will open to reveal the winning lottery ticket as promised by Mephisto
Clicking on the ticket triggers a fairly long cut scene that chronicles the murder of Lilly by her now separated sister Jody She chops the body up and sneers something about ldquo being close to Hannibal rdquo She disposes of the head in the stove and debates what to do with the skull when finished After the movie ends we are transported to a different location in the park the front of some type of spooky roller coaster ride
Click forward several times to move towards the ride rsquo s entrance Click to get into the skull car and click again to begin the ride The fast moving ride loops around continuously but you will notice one anomaly ndash at a certain point in the loop a right hand pointing cursor will show up on the screen When you see this cursor start clicking furiously to force your car to take a different path on the ride You may have to keep doing this over and over until you magically hit the cursor at the right moment ndash I rsquo ve had to go around the loop up to six times in a row before getting the car to take the alternate path
Your car travels up an unfamiliar tunnel and stops at a dead end Find the skeleton located on the right hand side of the wall at the end of the tunnel and click on it for a close up Click again on the skull and a copy of the ldquo agreement rdquo between Jody and Mephisto can be perused
Backing away from the skull triggers another setting shift ndash suddenly we rsquo re piloting an odd shaped paddleboat on a sun lit lake The boat comes to a stop and we are standing on a dock Follow the path up the slope and into a gazebo at the top Entering the gazebo triggers a hard to hear conversation with Theodore More who tells us about force and counter force and that a lot depends on our success here
Once Theodore has left click on the chair in the centre of the gazebo to sit down Panning to the left and right spins the rotating seat around Pan to the left until you can see a metal plaque on one of the gazebo rsquo s pillars Click for a close up ndash it commemorates the inauguration of the park in Back away spin to the right and stop when you hear a groaning noise coming from the rotation mechanism you should also be looking down the path towards your boat There should be a small brown square patch visible on the floor of the gazebo it is located in the shade of one of the pillars Click for a close up and press on the patch ndash this turns out to be a release button of some kind
Back away from the button and pan to the left to find the plaque again Clicking on the plaque again causes it to swing open revealing a small compartment containing a book This is Theodore rsquo s journal which contains entries for each of the seven characters to be investigated Grabbing the journal triggers a quick shot of Mephisto tossing the skull into the air back at the roller coaster ride
Back at the menu screen Theodore rsquo s Notebook may or may not be available for viewing from the Chapter Two page if it isn rsquo t scroll back to the Chapter One page and read the notebook from there The entries are quick to read and really do help to clear up some of the confusion of the chapter you just completed Note that the evidence from Chapter One the lottery ticket cannot be accessed and that the pact between Jody and Mephisto can be reviewed by clicking on ldquo Pact rdquo
Begin the second chapter ldquo The Alchemist and the Genie rdquo and listen to Mephisto prattle on about the nature of killing and the next subject ndash a Mr Nathaniel Meister You begin the next phase of the game in December staring at the back of a blocky building at twilight Walk forward towards the building turn to your right and move forward again to stand beside a water well Turn to your left walk forward and move forward again a bit to the left actually onto the front deck of the building Walk forward a step and turn to your left to see a unmoving water wheel with a lever to its left that won rsquo t work Turn back around walk back along the deck turn to your right and enter the front door of the house At this point you may want to turn off all of your lights because this Chapter is dark and hard to see
You stand in a high spacious entranceway with several staircases leading off to the left and right By now you rsquo ve noticed that some pretty inventive people were handling the architectural design elements of the game Turn to the left a bit and proceed up the stairs leading to the left You rsquo ve now entered Nathaniel rsquo s office ndash turn to the left and click on his diploma from Princeton We hear Nathaniel rsquo s voice lamenting his fall from Ivy league to trailer trash and blaming the Secret Service Back away the two pictures to the right of the diploma can also be examined but reveal little information
Turn to the right and click on the ashes in the fireplace ndash a burnt scrap of paper and voices heard over the telephone don rsquo t seem to tell us anything Back away turn back to the left a bit and click on the easy chair in front of the desk click again on the scratches on the chair rsquo s left arm rest We get a flash of Mephisto looking very nonplussed Back away from the chair and walk past the left side of the desk moving forward into the room
From your corner location turn to face the desk again and find the hotspot on its surface just to the left of the telephone We see another glimpse of Mephisto in full arm swinging mode Now find another hotspot along the left edge of the desk ndash just in front of the chair here where a drawer should be It actually is a drawer ndash but the area is so dark you can hardly make it out Pick up the pipe inside the desk as well as the boxy item below the pipe ndash a box of matches as it turns out Back away to close the drawer and turn to the right to face the wall bookcase
Note that each of the shelves of the bookcase has a small white label above it ndash just mouse over the labels to read the name of each subject at the bottom of the screen There are several books to investigate on the bookcase Find the hotspot on the second shelf ldquo Faust rdquo from the floor on the left bookcase and click there A copy of Goethe rsquo s Faust appears on the screen ndash click to open the book and click again to hear a short passage Close the book and place it back on the shelf
Your next destination is the ldquo Kryptology and Coding rdquo shelf on the middle bookcase ndash it rsquo s the thone from the floor Mouse over the right side of the shelf to hear your own voice reading the label and then click here to view a copy of Meister rsquo s university thesis Clicking on the book yields a short intro from Nathaniel and then our own voice making a comment Back away from the book and click on the other hotspot on the left side of the same shelf A thick book ldquo Code Book rdquo is shown to us ndash click on the metal hook like object sticking out of the top of the book Check your inventory ndash it was a key ndash and then back away from the book view
Examine the top shelf of the middle bookcase ldquo History rdquo and click in the centre of the shelf A book titled ldquo History of WWII rdquo appears in the centre of the screen ndash click on the book to open it Clicking on the left hand page triggers a passage detailing Operation Fortitude a British Secret Service initiative in which the Allies successfully convinced the Germans that a landing would take place in the north of France As a result the German forces were spread too thinly and the invasion was successfully carried out A key component of the plan was the sacrifice of a number of French resistance agents who were purposely fed false information and then given to the Germans who tortured and killed them Click on the right hand page to hear Nathaniel rsquo s rather dim view of the operation
Back away from the book and pan to the right until the corner shelf unit comes into view The upper portion of the unit is locked so take your Code Book key out from inventory and click on the keyhole to unlock it Inside you rsquo ll find five small drawers with a rolled up paper located below and to the right of the drawers Click on the paper ndash it appears to be some sort of map with a whole series of sections cut out of it Place it into your inventory
Open the top left drawer and click on the object inside ndash it rsquo s a signet ring with a pelican on it Now open the top centre drawer and click on the paper inside This appears to be an agreement dated between Meister and Theodore More spelling out a contract ndash Meister teaches anyone in the park in exchange for the construction of his house and food The agreement cannot be placed into your inventory Open the top right drawer and pick up the magnifying glass inside
On to the bottom left drawer which gives a funny sounding knock when fully opened Pick up what looks like a hunting knife from the open drawer check your inventory ndash this is actually a ldquo letter opener rdquo Close the drawer and open the bottom right one ndash unfortunately it only seems to open half way Remembering that funny knocking sound from the bottom left drawer close the bottom right drawer open the bottom left one and then re open the bottom right one The drawer should pull out completely ndash click on the shape inside the back compartment of the drawer and then look at your inventory to see what you rsquo ve grabbed it rsquo s the wooden head of a statue What rsquo s the best thing to do with the head of a wooden statue Put it back on it rsquo s body of course Back away from the view of the drawers and look down near the base of the corner unit ndash two statues to the left and right and the one on the left is missing it rsquo s head Grab the head from your inventory and place it on the top of the left statue ndash immediately the bottom left side of the cabinet swings open to reveal a hidden compartment The close up view shows three reel tapes on a shelf below a tape player Click on the tapes to put them into inventory grab Tape click on the right side of the player to place the tape here and press the ldquo Play rdquo right pointing arrow button
The tape contains two audio recordings of Nathaniel speaking in about some disappointing pupils of his Note He clearly seems to be speaking about the twins here which leads me to believe that Chapter One actually took place in instead of Stop the tape by pressing the button with the square on it and click on the tape again to place it back into inventory You can also listen to Tapes and in the same manner ndash one has a rocking song by John Lee Hooker on it while the other song sounds like the Monster Mash recorded in German
Back away from the compartment ndash the tapes return to their place on the shelf and the cabinet door closes
Pan to the right ndash you can take a step towards the green curtain ahead but there isn rsquo t anything to see or do there Instead turn around walk back towards the stairs and descend them At the bottom of the stairs turn to face the other staircase that rises up to the right and proceed up this staircase Click on the door at the top of the stairs to go forward into Nathaniel rsquo s bathroom
You can spend some time looking around in here but there isn rsquo t anything to see or do Turn around and click on the door to exit Descend the stairs and turn to the left once you rsquo ve reached the bottom Click forward to move past the bathroom staircase and then turn to your left to see a small set of stairs leading downward Walk forward down the stairs and click on the closed door ahead ndash we hear a conversation between Nathaniel and Theodore indicating that the kitchen is not finished just yet and thus is inaccessible
Turn around walk back up the stairs turn to your right move one step forward Panning to the left you should be able to make out a door located to the right of the stairs leading to Nathaniel rsquo s office Click on this door to enter Nathaniel rsquo s bedroom
Have a quick look around in here ndash there is much to see ndash and start by examining the ldquo map rdquo on the closet door to the right of the large globe Click on this map to look closer ndash it looks suspiciously like the one we found inside the corner unit in Nathaniel rsquo s office ndash except that it has all the pieces that were missing from that first map Take out the map from inventory and click on the map on the door ndash nothing happens Back away from the map and then open this door by clicking anywhere on the door except the map The door opens to reveal a bare spot on the wall behind the location of the map
Take out the map from your inventory and click on the empty spot ndash the map is placed on the wall Now click on the door to close it and the map is completed We hear the same audio passage from the ldquo History of WWII rdquo book from the office The map itself shows the latitude degrees minutes and longitude degrees minutes of the actual landing spot of the invasion at Omaha Beach on June After the audio is done we see a close up of what looks to be a combination lock on the globe The first numbers of the combination are automatically revealed leaving a digit number to be determined
Back away from the map and move towards the left of the large globe You rsquo ll find a ratty tapestry hanging on the wall here that has a rainbow on it Pan to the right and click on the lumps of metal on the right side of the globe We see a close up of the locking mechanism that we glimpsed earlier We will have to find the digit code to complete the combination Back away from the lock and return to your initial position by walking towards the closets to the left of the bed
It rsquo s time to investigate Nathaniel rsquo s door closet Facing the closet doors click on the left most one Nothing of interest here so click on the open door again to close it Now try the second one from the left ndash here we have sweaters and shoes Click on the sweater to the right ndash we find a postcard from Omaha Beach Omaha again
Click on the postcard to turn it over revealing a cryptic message A Back away from the postcard and close the second closet door
Now try the second door from the right ndash more shirts and shoes Click on the top shirt of the pile to see its blurry label Take out the magnifying glass from your inventory and click on the label to get it in focus The label contains some standard washing instructions but there is a curious set of picture steps near the bottom of the label The first shows a knife next to a sealed envelope the second illustrates the knife moving under and through the seal and the third shows that a downward slice with the knife opens the letter Back away from the label and close the closet door
The door furthest to the right is opened with a click revealing yet another set of shirts and shoes There aren rsquo t any clues here so shut the door back away and turn to the bed Click on the metallic panel on the wall above and to the left of the bed On closer inspection the lid to the left and the lever to the right cannot be manipulated at this time Back away from the panel and examine the bed
Doesn rsquo t something strike you as a bit odd about Nathaniel rsquo s very skinny bed That rsquo s right the bed posts have some sort of large round carving on them Click on several of the posts for a closer view Each post has a carving of a man with a pipe in his mouth ndash the pipes on the two posts at the head of the bed area pointing sideways while the pipes on the two posts at the foot of the bed are pointing upwards Each post also has a circular wooden dial with an arrow that can be rotated by clicking and holding on the arrow and dragging the mouse around The two dials on the left side of the bed go from to clockwise and the dials on the right side go from to
Do we have any numerical information with scales of and Yes ndash the latitude and longitude of Omaha Beach which are given to us in degrees to and minutes to The only thing left is to determine whether the latitude should be set on the head of the bed and the longitude set on the foot or vice versa
Take out the pipe from your inventory and examine it The small settings on the shaft indicate that we read latitude when the pipe is upright and longitude when the pipe is pointing to the left click the fat end of the pipe to rotate it But remember that the pipes on the bed posts are either pointing upwards or to the RIGHT In order to be able to rotate our own pipe from an upright position to a right pointing position we rsquo ve got to treat the ldquo longitude rdquo left pointing position as the upright position Got it No Well our inventory pipe tells us that the posts with the upright pipes the foot of the bed should be set to the longitude co ordinates while the posts with the right pointing pipes the head of the bed should be set to the latitude co ordinates Trust me
Your next step is to shut off all the lights since the developers made these dials so dark and hard to see that entering these co ordinates is a real pain
Start at the foot of the bed ndash the longitudinal co ordinates are degrees minutes The left post rsquo s dial should be set to zero If you haven rsquo t touched this dial the arrow should already be pointing straight upwards to zero at the very top of the dial If not rotate the arrow so that it points straight up to
The right post needs to be set at minutes The dial goes from to so the arrow should point directly towards the west compass direction or put another way straight to the left
Next go to the two posts at the head of the bed ndash the latitude co ordinates are degrees minutes
The left post rsquo s dial should be set to degrees As the dial runs from to and every ten degrees is shown with a large tick and a numerical label the arrow should point to the thlarge tick counting clockwise from the top of the circle This positions the arrow a little below straight to the right or put another way a little south of due east
Similarly the right post rsquo s dial should be set to degrees the ndlarge tick counting clockwise from the top of the circle This positions the arrow pointing to the south east actually a little closer to east than south The right posts are the harder ones to set since they are darker and the positioning is a bit more finicky Try varying the positions of the arrow on each a bit ndash once the correct setting is reached the game pauses the view reverts back to the whole bed and a drawer along the side of the bed slides open
Click on the box inside the now opened bed drawer for a close up The box is locked with some sort of metal clasp with a pelican symbol Luckily you found a signet ring upstairs with that exact marking on it Take the ring out and click on the symbol to open the lock Pick up the light coloured item on top of the opened box it rsquo s a decoding wheel ndash save it for later
and then click again on the box to get another close up
Another lock here ndash this one consists of wheels with a rainbow of colours present on each one We must determine the proper order of the colours in order to gain access Where have we seen a sequence of colours before On the tapestry over by the globe of course ndash a rainbow shown in the following colour order violet dark blue light blue green yellow orange red Note that if you return to the tapestry to check this yourself the locked box will have to be reopened with the signet ring
Turn each colour wheel by clicking and holding down the left mouse button and moving to the left or right
Place the colours in the order listed above from top to bottom The colour chosen for each wheel must be positioned so that it touches the right edge of the visible portion of the wheel this makes for a rather strange looking rainbow progression Once the sequence has been correctly entered the box below opens to reveal a single white envelope Click on the sealed envelope for a close up ndash it looks similar to the one in the tiny pictures on the shirt label we saw in Nathaniel rsquo s closet
Grab the letter opener from your inventory and position the tip of the blade just to the left of the right side of the letter rsquo s seal Slowly move the tip to the left so that the blade runs under the seal and out the left side as well Complete the opening by slicing downward with the blade Note that if you mess this up a green cloud of gas comes out of the envelope but this simply resets the sealed envelope again
The note inside this envelope is infuriating ndash this was simply a training envelope to open Back away from the note and return to the centre of the room
Let rsquo s have a look at that decoding ring we got from the locked box It rsquo s got an outer ring of black letters and numbers shown in order and an inner ring of random red letters and numbers Using the clue that we got from the Omaha Beach post card A O spin the inner ring just click and rotate and align the ldquo A rdquo on the outer ring with one of the ldquo O rdquo s on the inner ring there are two of them The inner ring is a bit difficult to manipulate ndash go slowly and be patient
Our next step is to figure out what word needs to be converted into numbers to enter into the globe locking mechanism What letter word is associated with the date and the post card giving us the decoding clue OMAHA Now find the ldquo O rdquo ldquo M rdquo ldquo A rdquo and ldquo H rdquo on the outer ring of the decoder and write down the aligned red letter number on the inner ring If you rsquo ve chosen the ldquo O rdquo between the and the on the inner ring the results will be a combination of letters and numbers However if you rsquo ve chosen the ldquo O rdquo between the M and N on the inner ring you should be able to assemble the following numerical equivalent to OMAHA
Back away from the decoder and walk to the left of the globe Pan to the right and click on the locking mechanism on the right edge of the globe Adjust the set of five digits at the bottom of the mechanism to read ldquo rdquo The wheels are changed by clicking and holding the mouse button down and dragging the mouse up or down The globe splits at its equator and opens
Click on the scarf to the right to hear a short passage from Nathaniel mentioning something about a promise to save ldquo her rdquo Now click on the letter to the left ndash this is the real sealed envelope you must open with the letter opener Grab the opener from your inventory and repeat the steps from before ndash insert the tip slowly and open it with a quick downward slice If you do screw it up a green gas appears and kills you This time though you are sent off to heaven where God tells you how disappointed he is in you you then arrive back in front of the globe to try the envelope again
The letter inside is Nathaniel rsquo s resignation letter ndash apparently he was involved with the decision making of Operation Fortitude although he wasn rsquo t aware of the level of sacrifice some of the operatives would have to make He may have also lost a loved one as the scarf suggests We then witness a scene between Nathaniel and Mephisto in which the evil one offers immortality and unlimited knowledge to Meister who turns it down
We are returned to Nathaniel rsquo s office in July He rsquo s collected a few more books but everything else is the same Walk towards the bookshelf we investigated last time and turn to the right towards the shelf in the corner Insert the key from your inventory into the main lock allowing access to those small drawers again Open up the top left drawer ndash there are two pieces of red and white wax here to collect The same More Meister contract is in the top centre drawer and the top right one is empty
The bottom left and right drawers are also empty you can re check the secret compartment again if you want but note the tape reel present in the bottom centre spot where there is no drawer Just click here to grab the tape Back away from the drawers and click on the head of the left wooden statue near the floor ndash this opens the left hand shelf with the tape player again Grab the new tape from your inventory place it on the player and hit the play button The message is from Meister for ldquo the one who rsquo ll come rdquo he rsquo s evidently anticipated our visit He rsquo s set up a treasure hunt for us that will lead to the creation of the one who will be our assistant
The three tapes present on the shelf below the player are the same but there is now a slip of paper below the tapes Pick up the paper to read ldquo If you want to know about fire learn about ashes rdquo Back away from the shelf and turn to the left towards the bookcases All of the hotspots on the books and the desk are the same as last time except for the spot on the ldquo Faust rdquo bookshelf left bookcase second shelf from bottom Clicking here triggers a voiceover from someone ndash but unfortunately the developers mistakenly have a Mephisto recording playing over the proper audio here In order to read the proper words that are said you must have the subtitles option checked on the Options screen accessible from the Main Menu There isn rsquo t really any new information given out but its nice to read what rsquo s actually being said
Walk one step towards the stairs and turn to face the fireplace Grab the shovel leaning up against the wall to the right of the chair and then click on the bellows lying on the ground in front of the fireplace This causes a compartment to open at the back of the fireplace Grab the small wooden box inside the compartment the box now appears in the bottom left corner of the screen Evidently this is your treasure holder ndash note that the two pieces of wax have already been placed inside this box
Now pick up the wood item it rsquo s a ldquo handle rdquo and a slip of paper found inside the fireplace compartment The paper reads ldquo The frog in the well knows nothing about the high seas rdquo Recall that there is a well outside the house ndash back away from the hearth pan to the right and descend the stairs to the front door Exit the house turn to your right and move forward Another step forward takes you to the well Take out the handle from your inventory and click on the wheel located to the right of the well The bucket automatically rises up to eye level

The object is placed into your wooden box Next click on the water bucket itself to read the following clue at the bottom of the bucket ldquo What is below is like what is above rdquo Hmm hellip not much to go on
Time to look around a bit ndash turn to your left and walk forward Turn to your left again and walk forward off the path into the trees From your new location turn to your left and examine the rocks on the ground here One rock in the centre of the screen has a hotspot over it ndash click here to turn the rock over Now there rsquo s a hotspot on the ground where the rock used to be Take out your shovel from inventory and click on the spot to find ldquo what is below rdquo Once the buried box is uncovered open it and take the telescope and the white unidentified object located inside The white object is placed into your collectibles box

Take out the red handle from your inventory and click on the broken lever located on the wall to the left of the wheel Click again on the restored control lever to send the water wheel into motion Watch the wheel spin around and keep in mind the last three words of the last clue ldquo after black rdquo After a while you will spot one of the blades of the wheel with a thick black horizontal line on it We want to stop the wheel so that the thblade after the black lined one appears Watch for the black blade and then count each successive blade that comes after After the sixth appears click on the red lever to stop the wheel at the seventh blade This make take a few tries but the wheel is pretty forgiving about when you click

General Observations It is difficult to characterize this game
The mark of Arxel Tribe and company is all over it
There are many individuals and the relationships between them is frequently far from clear and occasionally seems to change
The story line contains very many nonsequiters in that there seems to be no point to what has happened or if there is a point being made it is obscure in the extreme
You want a conclusion a reasonable wrap up and it is not there you are left hanging
There are required actions for which the indications are so vague as to defy deciphering or so cryptic as to resist any logic
There are things that occur without any explanation such as Siamese twins suddenly becoming separate when it suits the action
There are puzzles that must be solved for which there is no clue such as rearranging books by title against a sentence that appears nowhere
There are dead ends and red herrings in abundance though that is of course characteristic of Adventure games
Some might seem so but are really not
For example very early on in Episode you will find a tooth that goes into inventory and is never accessed however if you do not have it the climactic scene between the twins will not occur
There is a lot of this type of action throughout the game
This is a linear game and you should proceed through it following the numbered episodes even though these do not occur in chronological sequence
This latter fact gives rise to some contradictions that will be addressed later
Be sure to read carefully pages of the game book The Rollodex p appears as Theodore s Notebook on a bar at the bottom of the menu page
You can access it when it is highlighted but this only happens at the end of an episode
On this bar there is also a pact function where a pact with Mephisto is repeated but to what purpose
The evidence function is not explained The Shoot cursor is an animated grasping hand that signifies you can pick an item up The Dreamland park map that appears with the spacebar function is of little use
It is not a very good map and there is little need to know where you are mapwise The Esc key may be used to skip some sequences
Under the Options menu there are adjustments for Dialog Volume and Volume but no explanation for what these sliders do
Operations that seems obvious do not work
One would hope that there would be a way to separately control the background music from the speech of the characters but with no adjustments of either slider the speech volume changes from overloud to hard to hear
After a while it would be a relief to do away with the background particularly the sappy saccharine lullaby that accompanies the menu screen
Perhaps you can determine how these sliders actually operate to make these adjustments
In any event have the subtitles on
Inventory action leaves something to be desired
There are occasions when you click on a hotspot nothing seems to occur as a result but if you check the inventory you will find you have acquired an item
At other times an inventory item will appear and you must place it in inventory
An item must always first be in inventory before you can make use of it
The character of Mephisto may grate a bit after a while but perhaps this is by design considering who he is in legend and religion
It is especially irritating after a while to hear his insulting remarks each time you load save or quit
He is an oily chap who is very full of himself and he does not mind letting you know it since he is forever talking
He does not have a very pleasant face and it never changes expression only his lips move slightly
And not that it matters he waves his arms extravagantly
Well most of the characters do when talking
Walkthrough As you play this game you are acting as Marcellus Faust a previous employee at the Dreamland amusement park trying to learn details of the lives of a few of the park s denizens mostly freaks
It is possible that this can be confusing at times because Marcellus shows up frequently in videos
Deal with it there are many other situations that are more confounding
Here is a suggestion that really should be taken to heart view the introductory video more than once
Trailer in the MOVIES menu
It sets things up pretty well which is particularly necessary in this game
Episode November Episode opens on a part of the Dreamland park where a boardwalk goes to a couple of carnival wagons and a tent
Mephisto is there giving a lecture you will find he does a lot of that
Check the STARS menu for the cast
There is of course nothing in inventory
The only dwelling open is the wagon of the twins Lily and Jody so go there

Enter the wagon
It is not very elegant
Turn left to the sink from which you can pick up a strainer
For some reason as soon as you do this a brief video of the twins picking up scattered coins appears
Perhaps this is to give you a look at these two or to indicate their avarice
Turn around and click on the ashpit door at the bottom of the stove
It will open to show three small piles of ashes
Get the ash shovel hanging from the back of the stove
Use the shovel to pick up an ash pile
Get the strainer from inventory
It comes to rest in front of the stove
Get the ash filled shovel from inventory and click it on the strainer dumping the ashes
Yes the ashes remain in the shovel while it is in inventory
Click on the strainer and drag it back and forth to sift the ashes
Do this thoroughly
Again use the shovel to pick up and the sieve to sift the other two ash piles
In one of the three you will find a tooth that goes into inventory with a video flash when you finish completely shaking the sieve
You will also find a burned key under one of the piles
Pick up the key
Back off from the stove and click on the blackboard
Note the numbers in the total column
These are amounts of unspecified currency units owed to the twins
Click on the drawer in the box below the blackboard which opens to show two books
The green one is more evidence of avarice
On the cover of the gray book you can make out the last part of Hannibal s name
Open it to see that he owes them of this unspecified currency
Walk toward the bed
Below the bedpost is a shallow drawer containing a key that you need
If you want to see what Hannibal looks like there are two pictures of him in the round frames
Walk toward the bathroom then turn to the dresser and click twice on the lamp to get a video of Hannibal and the twins
He is a slimeball with a thick Cockney accent
One of the twins wants to marry him
Or maybe both do it isn t clear
Click on the old Victrola to get a video of Mephisto stirring up the plot
Go into the bathroom and turn to the special commode for Siamese twins
Get the knife from the commode s water tank
Walk to the wardrobe next to the head of the bed and use the two keys to open it
Drag the red garment to the left to reveal a safe
Click on the safe to hear one of the twins remark about all our wealth
This is your clue to add the totals from the blackboard plus Hannibal s debt to get the combination of the safe
As you can see the dial of the safe is at
The combination is entered in the standard manner turn the dial cw to the first number then ccw past the first number to the second one then cw directly to the third number
The dial returns to and the safe opens
Inside the safe is a winning lottery ticket placed there by Mephisto
Pick it up and you are treated to a video of Jody using the knife to do away with Lily so the prize will not have to be shared
The twins somehow have become separate but there is no explanation of how this might have happened
The disposal of Lily s body is not clear but the stove is involved
On the other hand Jody says that that Lily will be as close to Hannibal as she ever dreamt of
Somehow Jody is left with Lily s skull to dispose of and she takes it to the park s Ghost Train
That is where the program now transports you as well
Walk to and get into the waiting train car
Click on the tunnel entrance to begin the train ride
This is a sort of maze in which if you do nothing you just continue to ride
However a right pointing hand will appear briefly in the blackness just before the track divides and if you press the left mouse button whenever you see the hand the ride will eventually end at a wooden barrier against which a skeleton is leaning
From the mouth of the skeleton you can get a contract from Mephisto guaranteeing Jody great wealth if she will give up Hannibal
Back off and you are transported again this time to a paddlewheel boat cruising on a park lake
What has happened to Jody and to Lily' skull
The boat stops at a dock leading to a large ornate gazebo
Walk to the gazebo where you will be seated at a bench in it
Theo comes and talks to you about the gazebo arches and looking at the sunset then he leaves
You are standing again
Walk to the bench to sit in it and look down
The floor of the gazebo is a compass rose you should be facing South
Turn until you find on the gazebo floor in the shadow of one of the pillars a hard to see small gold rectangle
Click on it to get close then click again to move it down
Back off and rumblings are heard
Turn to look directly east
There is a plaque in the pillar straight ahead
Click on it to read about the redesigned park dedication in November in Savannah presumably Georgia
Click on the plaque to have it swing aside
Inside the pillar is a book
Pick it up
It is Theodore More s notebook
With a final short appearance by Mephisto the episode ends the menu screen appears and you are set to begin Episode
You may click on the left end of the banner at the top of the screen to go back to the end of Episode and you can then read Theodore s Notebook at the bottom of the screen
You may also review Jody s pact with Mephisto if you wish
The lottery ticket appears as evidence evidence of what
Click on the right end of the banner to return to Episode Episode December Episode begins of course with philosophic remarks from Mephisto
The STARS menu will show only a small cast of characters and the inventory has only the lottery ticket from the last episode
You will have an exterior view of a building shaped like a Quonset hut which is as you will in due time learn the park quarters of Nathaniel Meister
You will also learn that the structure was built to Nathaniel s specifications
You can see what must be a waterwheel on the left side of the building and you can hear running water but the wheel is not turning

Walk to the building
You have to go around to the other side of it to find the entrance
On that side at the end of the porch by the light there is an opening showing a bucket of the now covered and unmoving waterwheel
Go back to the center of the building for the entrance
Enter and go up the stairs at the left
You may as well know here at the start that there is a bathroom at the top of the right stairway and that it plays no part in the action
There is a door behind and below these stairs that is locked for now
Look at the diploma and first picture at the top of the left stairway in order to learn a little more about Nathaniel
The diploma is signed by no less a luminary than John von Neumann
Those literate in computer history will be impressed by this
Walk forward to the writing desk in the corner
Locked of course
Note the headless wooden statue by the left leg of the desk
Turn left to the bookshelves built into the wall
You can read the title cards on the edges of the shelves and you can also get and read a little bit of a few of the books if you wish
The book you want is the large leaning one in Kryptology and Coding section
Get the key that is protruding from the top of the spine
Now you can open the writing desk and lower the writing surface
From beneath the right edge of the blotter get the peculiar looking paper that the inventory calls a geological survey map
The center drawer presents a somewhat strange contract between Nathaniel Meister and Dreamland park architect and owner Theodore More
From the other drawers you may get a magnifying glass a sealing signet ring a paper knife and the head missing from the wooden statue
In order to get the lower right drawer to open all the way to reveal the head the lower left drawer must be open when you open the right one
Back off from the desk so it will close
Put the head on the statue and a door behind it will open
Inside are a tape machine and three reels of tape
Click on the tape reels to put them in inventory
Retrieve tape and put it on the machine then press the switch on the right to hear a recording that does not seem to have much significance
When it is done click on tape to put it back in inventory
When you back off from the cabinet the three tapes return and the door closes
Go to the big desk and open the center drawer
Pick up the matches that you will need in subsequent episodes
Don't bother with the pipe
Now return downstairs and enter Nathaniel s bedroom through the door under the left stairway
Turn to see the square drawing in the arched door
It very much resembles the geological map that you found upstairs
Open the door and place the map from inventory in the brick square
Now when you close the door you get a readable map of the English Channel and the French coast
You also get a narrative about the WW II Normandy invasion and Operation Fortitude
On the map Omaha Beach is identified by its longitude and latitude and the invasion date is indicated
At the conclusion of the story you get a quick glimpse of some numbered wheels being set and you are left looking at among other things a large world globe
Walk over to the globe and turn right so that you can see the equatorial ring on the right side of the globe
Click on the ring and you will see the numbered wheels
The top two rows have been set to the invasion date shown on the map
Go to the four doored wardrobe against the wall
Open the second door and locate a picture postcard of Omaha Beach turn it over to see the notation A
Open the third door and find a garment label that is too out of focus to read
Use the magnifying glass to clear it up
The row of three numbered diagrams on it are what is relevant the steps to open a sealed document
You would hardly need instruction for this operation but you have to read this label for program progress
Click on the four bedposts and you will find that each contains a dial and pointer the details of these dials especially those on the right are not all that easy to distinguish making this exercise unnecessarily difficult since the dials must be set exactly and the pointers do not line up precisely with the dial numbers
You have to set the dials at the head of the bed for the latitude of Omaha beach degrees on the left post minutes on the right one and the dials at the foot for the longitude
The dials on the left posts have major numbered divisions so that makes degrees for each division the dials on the right post have major divisions so they are minutes for each division

When you get the four dials set precisely correct the drawer in the side of the bed will open
In it is a box or a book that is closed with a sealed clasp
The sealing ring will take care of that
After the clasp springs up click on the white spot where the seal was
The coding wheel appears briefly then goes into inventory
Click on the cover to raise it and reveal seven bicolored wheels
If you drag on these wheels to turn them you will discover there are in fact more colors and that they are the seven colors of the optical spectrum Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet though the color rendition is in some cases more pastel than primary
Drag the wheels so that the spectrum is represented bottom to top on the edge of the opening between the two triangles and the inner cover rises so that you can pick up and display the sealed document at the box bottom
Insert the paper knife under the seal and pull it down as shown in the garment label
All that for a practice document
Back off and everything closes except the drawer
Get the code wheel from inventory and drag the inner wheel around until A
Read the numbers corresponding to the word Omaha
Go again to the numbered wheels on the globe equatorial ring and set the lower row of wheels to this number
The globe opens
Click on the scarf inside for a statement of mysterious import
Presumably a lady dear to the heart of Nathaniel was a member of the French Resistance group of the Operation Fortitude narrative and despite assurances of safety the group was eliminated after providing the false information
Get the envelope from the globe and use the paper knife to open it as before
It is a letter dated seven years previously from Nathaniel to a British government official refusing appointment to a government position and hinting at reasons why
One can infer that the loss of the lady is prominent
Back off from the letter and there is a video in which Mephisto offers Nathaniel vast wisdom and immortality in exchange for something not quite clear
This must have happened sometime earlier because it shows Mephisto scratching the fabric of the armchair and the scratches were there on the chair s arm when you first entered the building
Nathaniel refuses Mephisto s offer and the video fades Part It is eight years later in the study at the top of the stairs
Nathaniel has gone but has left behind a series of clues that he anticipates you will follow
You still have the key to the writing desk
Open it to find another tape and some sticks of wax in the upper left drawer
Click on the wooden statue to open the compartment in which is the tape machine
Play the tape
It is about a treasure hunt using clues by analogies the reward being an assistant
The narrator claims to be Nathaniel but sounds more like Mephisto
Below the tape machine is a note about ashes
Get the Faust book from the lower left shelf in the bookcase for a little more about the treasure hunt
Be sure that the subtitling is on
As for ashes well there is a fireplace in front of the large desk
When you go to it you will find there are some tools immediately to the left of it among which is a shovel that you will need
Click on the bellows pointing into the fireplace
Ashes are blown away and a recess in the back of the fireplace appears in which is a wooden tray
Click on the tray and it moves to the lower left of the screen to be your companion for a while
The tray has compartments and the wax sticks jump from inventory into the front left ones
The other tray compartments have symbols on the bottom
These compartments must be filled as you progress
In the fireplace compartment is a note wrapped around a handle
Click in this combination to read the note another clue about the frog in the well
The handle goes to inventory
You must have noticed the well as you rounded a corner of the house on the way in
Leave the house now and go to it
Use the handle on the crank wheel to bring up the bucket on the handle of which is a metal frog with what looks like a ring in its mouth
Click on this item and it goes into your ever present treasure tray
Look in the bucket for another treasure clue
Pretty obscure in fact not much of a one at all
Walk left along the boardwalk and go a couple of clicks into the woods to look for a rock that you can overturn
When you find one there will be a rectangular outline in the turf beneath it
Use the shovel to unearth a small chest in which there is a telescope and a clue
Pick up the telescope monocular and read the clue
This one is more forthcoming
Turn left a little and look up into the tree foliage for a hotspot
You will find a hook affixed to a tree branch and carved into another branch is a symbol similar to one in the bottom of a treasure tray compartment
Put the telescope on the hook and look through it
In the distant rock face is another of the same symbol
Walk to it
From a crack in the rock get a tray item and then another handle again with a clue wrapped around it
movement and half in air half in water refers to the waterwheel
seven after black are the operative words
Go to the waterwheel
On the left of it is an obvious place to put the handle
Click below the installed handle and the waterwheel moves click above it and it stops
Start the wheel and watch closely for a bucket with a black edge
Counting that bucket as stop the wheel after not more have passed
The bucket window is now a hotspot
Look in and click on the tiny lever on the bottom of the bucket
A lid will rise and you can get one more treasure tray item also a key and a clue this one again quite cryptic Iris rainbow sailors
You should have noticed a rainbow on a tapestry in Nathaniel s bedroom when you were near the globe
Go there now
You will doubtless be surprised to find that while you were outside the box in the drawer in the side of the bed has been replaced somehow by a pyramid which is in fact a mirror
Pick it up
In addition the invasion map in the arched door has been replaced by a picture of what appears to be conquistadors though one is carrying an oar so they may be the sailors of the clue
Join these two new items put the pyramid mirror in the feathered fedora of the man carrying the oar
Focus your attention on the apparatus on the wall above the bedlamp
The newly acquired key will open the panel on the left and the unit may be activated by clicking on the red knob to move it from left to right
In the wall to the left of the globe is a bright stained glass window that heretofore has been dark
Go to this window and press the red button in its center
A laser beam emerges from it and bounces all around the room glancing off several reflectors and coming to rest on where else
The rainbow in the tapestry Iris rainbow
Crazy
Click twice on the place where the laser beam comes to rest to get yet one more treasure tray item and another clue appears in the mouth of an animal on the tapestry
This one tells you in Latin to visit the center of the earth in other words open the globe again
Click on the globe to open it and get a green treasure tray item and a clue about a shoe
You saw a lot of shoes earlier in the wardrobe
Open the second door where one of the shoes is not neatly placed as are all the others
Click on this shoe and then on its heel to get a final message meet in the kitchen
All but two of the treasure tray compartments are filled
The kitchen entrance is below the never used right stairway in the hall
Go there and enter the kitchen
On the kitchen wall to the left you can open the rightmost of the three cabinets to find five packets of salt
Click on a packet of rock salt to put it in the treasure tray
Turn to the counter in the center of which is a peculiar appearing apparatus with an ornate glass container suspended above it
Get a closeup of this apparatus and it goes into action somehow removing items from the treasure tray and ultimately bringing a homunculus into the glass container
This is the companion assistant you were promised
The treasure tray turns into something that looks like a folded newspaper
You are transported to the gate of Dreamland with only the homunculus matches and the lottery ticket remaining in inventory
Above are some lights one of which is flickering
Get the homunculus from inventory and click it on the flickering light
You will move to a map of Dreamland before which Theodore More is standing and telling why he created it in
Click on the podium to pick up the map
Fade to Nathaniel s study where Mephisto makes a brief appearance and the episode concludes
The menu screen appears and you are set to begin Episode
Use the banner at the top of the screen to go back to Episode so that you can read Theodore s Notebook at the bottom of the screen
However all he has added is a copy of Nathaniel s letter to the British ministry
There are no pacts and the folded newspaper has been added to the evidence mystery Episode February The episode opens after Mephisto s remarks on a dock where you have just left the paddlewheel boat
Check the STARS menu Kalinka and Giselle are listed but they are not in this episode
Theo More is not listed but he appears at the end
The inventory holds the homunculus the matches from Nathaniel s study desk and the lottery ticket from Episode

Walk up the dock turn left move forward left again and down the steps to an underwater apartment presumably that of Frank Barnes
Turn right and move forward where you will be facing a mirrored door to a closet in the corner of the room
Click twice on the blue pad on the right side of the door to open it then look at what the man in the painting appears to be holding aloft in his right hand
It is a wig
Pick it up
Go to the opposite corner of the room where there is a cabinet on which rests a small red chest and a cup filled with pens pencils and the like
If you open the cabinet you can see some items but they are not accessible
Open the chest and read a short satirical newspaper clipping about Frank or click on it and a voice will read it to you
You learn that he is an artist
Click on the cup and a long thin item appears
Click twice on it and the inventory shows that you have picked up a compass needle and a thin pencil
Turn around and move toward the entrance steps where you can see other steps leading downward
Go down these steps and regard the painting of the two nudes
Use the thin pencil to touch the breast of the nude where it is being touched by the other
The painting parts and you can enter Frank s bedroom
At the foot of Frank s bed is a large compass lacking a needle
Since you have one in inventory you may as well install it
It points NW
Move across the bed in the direction the compass needle points to the Don Quixote type statue by the window
Click in it for a closeup
Get the wig from inventory and put it on the statue
Now you can turn the crank at the statue s base
The statue bows and orates
A drawer opens in the base
Get the barely visible key from the drawer and back off
There is a mermaid on the bedpost to the left
Click on the mermaid s navel
The navel flashes
Turn left to the next mermaid and repeat
Keep doing this until the canopy above the bed drops
Get off the bed and click the key on the dropped canopy
This starts a video sequence in which Marcellus opens a door in the canopy then the scene shifts to Frank drinking on the dock next to the paddlewheel boat
Mephisto appears walking on the water and offers Frank a deal to make women fall at his feet
Frank agrees
Mephisto says wait you haven t heard the price
You too will have to wait to learn what this price is because at this point the video fades Part It is now October nine years later and the scene is a duplicate of the opening one on the dock
Go up the pier and down the steps to the apartment as before and to the corner closet
This time instead of a wig you get a key
Turn to the right and take Frank s st Prize from its frame on the wall
Go again to the cabinet in the room s opposite corner
In the red chest in addition to the newspaper clipping there are now two letters neither very flattering to say the least
Click on them for a lady with a very affected voice to read them
There is nothing to get from the cup but from the cabinet you can now pick up a box of slides and a magnifying glass
Beneath the entrance steps is a viewing table
Spread the slides on it and use the switch at lower left to turn on the light
The magnifying glass is used to look at the slides
Most of the slides are inconsequential but one shows a clock that could be the one on the wall in this apartment
Go to the apartment clock and use the key from the bedroom to open the glass cover over the face
Drag the hands to the same time as that seen in the slide
Back off and the hands return to the previous setting
Faint bongs and cuckoos may be heard
Go downstairs and use the thin pencil to get into the bedroom
There is now a hole in the floor with a ladder leading down
Go down the ladder
You end up in what appears to be a darkroom and a messy one at that
On the wall is a row of prominent photos each with a number
Click on
Take the revealed light bulbs
Walk toward the camera and turn left to the sink
Click on the book
The edge of a manuscript can be seen below the pages at the bottom
Click on it and Frank will read it to you
Go to the projector device to the right of the camera
There is a bulb holder on the top of the bellows
Click on it to open it then put the red bulb in it
Click in the flat projection area below the bellows and place Frank s st Prize on it
Turn on the light using the switch on the lower right and read Frank s contract with Mephisto
Back off from the contract to start a video in which Frank attempts to immolate himself
Mephisto stops it and you are transported to the Ghost Train switching center
Walk straight ahead past the railcar and you will reach a gate into the central roundtable mound
Click on the left side of the gate to open it
Enter and go to the massive machinery on the far wall
Turn left and open the small door in the wall behind which you will find a miniature set of the same machinery
Pull the pendulum to left and release it
This starts the same action on the large machinery and for some reason the railcar goes to the top of the mound
Theodore More appears and muses for a while about the park then fades away to be replaced by Mephisto in the darkroom rationalizing and making excuses for himself
The episode ends the menu screen appears and you are set to begin Episode
Use the banner at the top of the screen to go back to Episode so that you can read Theodore s Notebook
He has added very little
Frank s pact with Mephisto can be seen and his manuscript has been added to the evidence mystery
Use the banner to return to Episode
Episode June After Mephisto s remarks this episode opens on a dock overlooking a body of water with hills in the distance and the paddlewheel steamer at the dock
On the far shore you can see other parts of the Dreamland park
Your inventory again contains only the homunculus matches and the lottery ticket from Episode
Check out the STARS on the Carousel introduction menu
Hannibal is not listed but his presence is strong
The twins are listed but they appear only in an optional very brief flashback

Turn around and walk to the ramp
You can t go up you need steps
Get the homunculus then click it on the lever at the top of the ramp
Now you have the stairs
Ascend the stairs
Turn right and go to the center of the courtyard between the table and the statue supporting a water globe
Optional for some plot thickening click on the potted plant on the table under the umbrella
Go up the stairs to the right of the statue
Open the box on the floor to left of the door and take the peacock feathers despite what Kalinka says
Note that the window in the door is broken
If you wish to know why click on it but it has little if any relevance
Click on the door to enter Kalinka s home where you will be looking at a stairway
Turn and walk to the left of the sewing machine
Turn right to face a work table
On the right end of this table are three horizontal rolls of material on a stand gray black and brown
Click on the brown roll to cut off a piece then do the same for the black roll
Take the brown piece of material hard leather from inventory and click it on the black cutting machine in the center of the work table
Put the resulting strong leather strap in inventory
Take the black piece of material soft leather from inventory and click it on the pattern machine at left end of the work table
Put the resulting pieces in inventory
Take these black pieces and click them on the cutting machine
Put the altered pieces back in inventory
Go to the sewing machine
Under the stairs against the wall behind you is a chest of drawers
Open one of the top drawers and get a respiration grill and some shoelaces
Turn to the sewing machine
Click the black soft leather pieces on it then the respiration grill then the shoelaces
Put the resulting mask in inventory
Walk between the sewing machine and the stairway
Ahead is a bathroom the entrance being through a pair of red curtains one of which is pulled aside
As soon as you enter confusion sets in
You will see a set of three brushes on the wall to your right and you will find a hotspot on the wall just to the right of the brushes
Click on this hotspot and a mirror appears reflecting the wash basin stand
The drawer in the stand in the mirror opens but not the one in the actual stand
From this open mirror drawer you can get first a roll of gauze and second some tissue
When you turn to leave you cannot exit between the curtains where you entered you must go through the curtain behind the tub
This bathroom experience does not make much sense
Go up the stairs and through the bedroom to the room with a loom and a cradle
Click on the loom for a statement from Kalinka to her lover Frank about wonderful news
She tenders a key by speaking click on the shuttle that is lying on the weaving to get the key which is a silver moon in a folded cloth
Unfold the cloth and click on the center of it to put the moon in inventory
Go back down the stairs and through the black figured curtain behind them and into the kitchen
Look at the face of the large grandfather clock then put the silver moon in the moon opening
The clock door opens
Go through the passage to the greenhouse where Mephisto gives Marcellus a lecture on time travel
You seem to have acquired a tray similar to the treasure clue tray in Episode
Look at the round table to the left of the door
In the center is a disk with astrological symbols surrounded by four trees with foliage indicative of the four seasons
Spring is in the lower left with Summer Autumn and Winter clockwise
Go back through the door to the kitchen
In a cupboard below the distillation apparatus on the counter you can pick up a sack of flour
Now leave the house and go to the Atlas statue holding the glass globe in the courtyard
Look at the wheel crank near the bottom on the left
you can t turn it because there is a nail jammed in the gears
Remove the nail then click on the crank to start the buckets filling the globe with water
When that s done click on the buckets to get the necklace that somehow got in one of them
Now click on the statue for a closeup then throw the switch on the top of the statue s head to drain some of the water
Click the sack of flour on the globe to get a glimpse of of the astrological symbols that you saw on the greenhouse table
Click on the globe to get a steady view so that you may make a note of them
Go back to the house and head for that goofy bathroom
Don t go in instead go to the right through the glass doors where there are six mannequins
You can click on all of them for statements but the only two of importance are Hannibal and the twins in the room at the right
After looking at them click the peacock feathers on the twins and the strong leather strap on Hannibal
Not a nice guy
Now for the time travel that was the subject of Mephisto s lecture
Go back to the greenhouse and the symbols on the round table
Click on the that you saw in the globe in the order they appeared
The table undergoes a convulsion and returns to normal
Click on one of the trees around the symbols
Any one will work but you may as well start with Spring
Another convulsion
A short video may follow maybe not depending upon the tree chosen
Go to the corner of the room where there are pots with herbs growing supported by sticks
Get a leaf from one of the plants it will go to that tray that is following you around
Repeat this procedure for the other three trees on the table then go to the kitchen with your herb leaves in inventory
If the forward cursor does not appear on the door click the Spring tree again
Get a closeup of the still
Remove the cork from the spherical container on the left and put in it the herb leaves that are now in inventory
Use the matches to light the burner and process some of the herb leaves into the container on the right
When the burner goes out you can place the processed leaves mixed herbs in inventory
To the right of the still is a box that will open when you click on it
Put the mask in the open box then the gauze on top of the mask
Put the herbs on the gauze and finally the tissue on the herbs
Pick up the completed mask
Return to the six mannequins and place the mask on Frank in the left glass room
He speaks about a ring
Go back upstairs to the room with the loom
A cloud with a miniature castle has appeared over the candle
Use the matches to light the candle and a little blue angel rides the track out from and into the castle
Put out the candle when the angel is out of the castle and she will stop
Click on the angel and a ring will appear in inventory
Back off from the cloud and the scene changes to the courtyard where Marcellus is having coffee with Kalinka
That concludes shortly and Mephisto appears for a speech then he too fades away and you are transported to a strange large room that must be a transportation terminal
An elevator at the end of the walkway is the only way out
The elevator takes you to a great library
Move ahead up a ramp turn right and walk to a ladder leaning against the bookshelves
When you climb to the top most of the books in the center shelf slide to the left exposing five that are sort of a light maroon in color
Click on these latter books and they will disappear
Continue moving to the left and clicking on each book as long as the bright action cursor shows
Right click to access the inventory it should show that you have twelve books there and running the cursor along them will show the title of each
If there are not twelve go back to the books on the shelf for the missing ones
Now you must put the books back using the first word of the title to make the sentence I Theodore Lost Hope In And Signed A Contract With Mephisto
Start at the left and slide the books in when their image as cursor brightens
When you succeed in this effort it is not difficult if you take your time and keep checking as you go the sentence is repeated with flashing lights and then on the library floor Theodore is seen telling Marcellus the circumstances of this pact
Mephisto joins the conversation tosses Marcellus a coin and has a few solo words
The episode ends the menu screen appears and you are set to begin Episode
Use the banner at the top of the screen to go back to Episode so that you can read Theodore s Notebook
He has added a lot about Kalinka and Frank and Kalinka s history
Despite Theo s pact with Mephisto nothing appears under this heading
Kalinka s silver moon is the evidence Episode March The opening remarks by Mephisto are perhaps a little more offensive than usual
He is on the boardwalk where Episode started
Inventory still contains only the homunculus matches and the lottery ticket
Check the STARS menu a new character Tod is to be introduced
The tent is now open so go into it

This place seems to have a little more class that the twins wagon but perhaps somewhat sleazy like its owner Hannibal
Walk ahead toward the sink on the back wall
Next to the sink is something that Hannibal has tried to make look like a grandfather clock
The face is a roulette wheel that you should pick up
For some reason inventory calls it a cylinder
Turn to the bench that has the roulette board on it and put the wheel in the tray on the end
Examine the poster and read the roulette numbers that Hannibal has written and crossed out
What you are supposed to come up with is Red Blue Black Red Red
Click on the wheel for a closeup then drag these numbers to the indicator pressing the yellow diamond on it after each number is positioned
The roulette numbers board rises
Step across the board look into the recess under the raised section
Get the whip and the film reel
Optional you can look at the pictures on the wall to get insights to Hannibal s character
Go toward the entrance curtain then turn right and move to the cabinet that is to the left of the round bed
Open the top doors
There are four bottles on the right of the top shelf the three larger ones have colored tops
Click on these tops in the same order as the colors you used on the roulette wheel
The front of the open cabinet drops to reveal another
Get the key then click on any of the bottles to bring up a video of a drunken Hannibal berating Tod who is delivering booze
It concludes with Hannibal dancing on the bed with rats at his feet
Close the cabinet doors and pick up the rat on the bed
To the right of the bed is a small table on which is a wire and a box from which protrudes a shaft and cylinder
Drag the wire to the terminals on the top of the box
Put the rat in the cylinder and click the whip on the rat to get it running
Click on Hannibal s picture above the bed
It slides away to reveal yet another cabinet
Use the key to open the cabinet and put the film reel on the projector that is in it
Turn on the rat powered projector to see a film about how to control tigers
The rules are not on the screen long enough to comprehend them so this is what they are A single lash and only one tiger will jump in a random direction but never on the central platform A double lash and both tigers will move in the direction they were moving before except if they are on the same podium in that case one of them will move in a random direction
Back off from the projector turn and walk across the room then go to the full length mirror next to the sink
Click on the mirror and make careful note of the four caricatures that appear on panels
Repeat so that you can recognize them
There is a large trunk and a small one next to the mirror
Open the large one and pick up the handle
Move once toward the entrance turn left and put the handle in the double cylinder set in the floor
Click on the handle and then immediately get the whip from inventory
One at a time five panels pop up briefly from a slot in the floor four of them are the ones that you just saw in the mirror
You must click the whip on these four and not on the other one
This is one of the more difficult exercises of the game because the whip is so faint that it is hard to locate and position in a hurry
Note where the whip appears when you get it from inventory so that you can move it from there
The critical point of the whip appears to be the end where it comes out of the coil
When you successfully make contact you will hear the crack of the whip
You are given repeated chances until you succeed and you are then transported to the center of Dreamland park
Move to the carousel then move past it to the right
Turn around and click on the horse that shows a hotspot
Get the ring from the bridle
Back off then move straight ahead to the carousel ticket booth
Click on the door to enter
Get a closeup on the control unit and put the ring on the two posts below the volt label
Pull the handle to start the carousel
When it gets going the door in the central pillar will fly open
When the carousel stops leave the booth go to the carousel open the door and go down the circular stairway to the tiger quarters
Go into the tigers den and click on the bones of a rib cage presumably human
Pick up the necklace
You then get a video in which Hannibal claims that after Jody killed Lily the body was fed to the tigers and one was poisoned
Recall that in Episode after Jody killed Lily she said that she Lily would be close to Hannibal
The video then goes to the tiger performance ring for a conversation between Mephisto in the stands and Marcellus in the ring finally with two tigers
Back to the game
You have just learned from Mephisto that you must get both tigers on the center stand and the movie in Hannibal s tent said to lash the whip once to make a tiger jump to another stand double lash to make both tigers jump
Get the whip and use it according to the rules of the movie or just randomly and eventually you will get both of them on the center stand and it will sink leaving a hole
Go into the hole and you will be back in the tigers den
Under a rock at the foot of a box you will find Hannibal s contract with Mephisto
Click on it to get it and have Mephisto read it to you
Back off from the contract and you are transported to the park cinema
Move to the entrance and click on the brown door to the right of the main doors
You are treated to a video of Theo More giving Marcellus a sermon at the conclusion of which there is a ticket on the counter
Pick up the ticket and go into the theater
Continue straight ahead into the projection booth
There is a hotspot among the many film canisters pick up that reel and put in on the projector
There follows a pointless series of old B amp W film clips about the depression and prohibition
Leave the projection booth for a final very tasteless video that concludes the episode
The menu screen appears and you are set to begin Episode
Use the banner at the top of the screen to go back to Episode so that you can read Theodore s Notebook
He has added a lot about Hannibal some of it conjecture some obscure some both
Mephisto s strange pact with Hannibal is available
Hannibal s whip is the evidence Episode June Be advised that Episode is more strange than even the others with action jumps and unexplained situations
It starts on the boardwalk of Episodes and
Mephisto s remarks are mercifully brief
Checking the STARS menu shows more characters than usual with an extra character played by Mephisto
Starting inventory holds the standard set homunculus matches and lottery ticket
You must have noticed the punching bag the other times you were here now you can use it

Click on the bag and Marcellus will hit it
Do it again and he will fall down after he kicks it
The homunculus laughs at him
Marcellus tells it to try
Click the homunculus on the bag and instead of hitting it to move the dial it flies up and moves the indicator arrow to the highest position
The door to the unvisited wagon opens
If you go to the open door it will close
Send the homunculus to hold it open
Enter the wagon
It is plainly furnished and very neat
As soon as you are in turn right and click on the poster to learn something about Tod including his date of birth which you will need
Optional there is a drawer cabinet below the poster
In it you will find a signet ring a St Christopher medal and a newspaper
Go to the bicycle and click on the rear axle then on the handlebars
Marcellus will ride it for a short period then the bed will open
Optional look at the items in the box that is revealed
Click on the box to have it move aside
Underneath is a trapdoor with a combination lock
The code for the lock is Tod s date of birth
Drag the dials so the numbers line up on the lower edge between the marks
When the door opens Marcellus climbs down a ladder to Tod s liquor operation in the space below
Time to make some booze
Go behind the large vat that has a ladder hooked over its rim
Click the red button on the wall switch
This will lower the stack of firewood from the upstairs woodbin and slide back the cover grating
Pick up a piece of firewood
You could bring a piece of wood from the woodbox upstairs down with you and skip this step
Turn around and get the pot on the floor next to the vat
Walk to the pyramid of casks
Click the pot on the spigot of the right center cask to fill it with molasses
Go to the stove
While you are there pick up an empty bottle from the box on the floor next to the stove
Open the door in the top of the stove and pour in the molasses from the pot
Close the door
On the floor next to some barrel staves at the foot of the entrance ladder there is a pail containing black material
Though not visible in the pail you can get an old newspaper from it
Open the fire door of the stove and put in the newspaper and the piece of firewood
Use a match from inventory to light the newspaper then back off to close the fire door
Turn back to the cask pyramid and take the tap from the left center one
Put this tap into the center one on the bottom and it will swing back so that you can crawl through
Here is where things start to get confusing
Click in the open cask to have Marcellus crawl through
There is then a video in which he starts to do this then Mephisto shows up and kicks him after which a short conversation follows then Marcellus is shown briefly talking to Theo in a different location after which you return to the game having made it through the cask
The room you are now in appears to be a dormitory
The impression is that Tod is caring for a group of street urchins
Go into the bathroom and turn right
Open the medicine cabinet and click on the bottle of red liquid to hear about another of Hannibal s misdeeds
Go back to the dormitory and turn right to the telephone
Click on it for a conversation with Mr Nitty
A poker game is arranged
Leave through the cask tunnel
In the outer room Marcellus metamorphoses to Tod evidently to the latter s surprise
Go up the ladder to Tod s living quarters
Mephisto as Mr Nitty with hat and cigar is seated at the table by the door
He wants a drink
Go to the sink and click on the faucets for a closeup
Click on the left one to start the booze flowing then click the bottle on the stream of booze
Turn off the faucet
Go to the table and pour a drink from the bottle into the glass on the table
The poker game is set to be played
After some remarks from Mr Nitty your hand is shown
Discard the cards that you don t want then click on the deck to fill your hand
Both hands are then shown with a win or lose statement
Back off to begin another hand
You keep playing until you win enough hands then the poker game concludes with a concession speech from Nitty
A video is immediately shown of a confrontation between Tod and Hannibal in Giselle s place with some of the other cast characters looking on
Tod overcomes Hannibal then Theo shows up for another history lesson
Mephisto makes a very brief appearance and the episode ends
The menu screen appears and you are set to begin Episode
Use the banner at the top of the screen to go back to Episode so that you can read Theodore s Notebook
He has added a posthumous letter written by Tod
Despite the pacts of this episode nothing appears under this heading
Tod s St Christopher medal is the evidence Episode December This episode opens at the entrance of Giselle s exhibition place on a hill above the entrance to Dreamland
Inventory carries the standard three items the STARS menu does not really list the total cast of characters
Enter Giselle s showplace

Of the four posters in the room it is only necessary to look at Giselle s to note her weight but look at the others anyway
Enter the alcove containing the bathtub
Remove the stopper from the bathtub drain and get the attached key
Use the key on the square below the scale dial then drag the toothed wheel to set the scale pointer to Giselle s weight
The tub sinks to her living quarters
Look around lots to see among which is an elaborate track system on the ceiling presumably to help Giselle get around
Click on the teddy bear on the floor next to the bed below the doll
Put it in inventory
Click on the doll and get a key from the doll s apron pocket
A conversation between Mephisto and Giselle follows
Pick up the four cubes next to the doll
Walk to the refrigerator and use the key from the doll to open the lock by the door handle
Open the refrigerator
Open the freezer compartment and click on the bright area next to the temperature gage
The inventory will show that you now have some frozen paper
Look at the refrigerator door where you will see four bottles on the upper shelf
You are to place the four cubes on the shelf below the bottles and the labels must match
When you do this successfully you can then open the lid of the compartment above the bottles and get the chain that is in it
Hang the chain from the ring on the shaft above the refrigerator
Move over to the stove and get a closeup
Put the frozen paper in the pot that is on the stove
Turn on the gas and use a match to light the stove
When the ice has melted turn the stove off
Click on the brown paper at the bottom of the pot
It is a note to Giselle from Mephisto which he reads aloud
The spoon he mentions can be found under the pillow on the bed no use is ever made of it but you must have or you won t get out of Frank s studio so pick it up
When you back off from the stove you get an arm waving altercation between Marcellus and Mephisto
Marcellus now has wings
Click on the basket apparatus hanging from the ceiling track
You can see a crank on the control unit
Click the teddy bear on this crank then click on the windup key that you can just see on the bear s back
You get a brief video of Giselle traveling in the basket to the refrigerator which has been raised by the chain you attached
Giselle disappears and is replaced in the basket by the teddy bear
A tunnel is revealed by the lifted refrigerator
Click twice on the tunnel and you will see Marcellus transporting Giselle down the tunnel on a handcar
It looks like Marcellus but sounds like Frank
The tunnel is another simple maze
Go consistently to either left or right every time the tunnel divides and you will come to Frank s studio
When you enter the studio go across to the open chest on the curved bench
Click on it for remarks by Frank and Giselle then open the drawer and take out the pieces of a picture which go to inventory
Click on the bench top hotspot to the left of the chest and put the picture pieces there then put them one by one back into inventory where they are shown numbered to
Now you must reassemble them on the bench top to show the completed picture
Start with number in the upper left of your assembly space
When done click on the upper part to see the picture it appears to be a double one and on the lower part for some words about the subject
Walk across the room to the large drawing to the left of the ladder then click on the second of the smaller drawings to the left of that
When the drawing lifts click on the turtle to get a newspaper clipping
Back off from the turtle to be transported outside to a Ferris wheel and a video of Marcellus and Theo and starring the Boss
You are brought down to a walkway leading to the Ferris wheel
Walk up to the Ferris wheel and click on the ticket booth
On the right wall of the booth is a rack of picture postcards click on them and you will find an assortment of seven in inventory
Put these cards on the ticket booth counter then get a closeup of them
Put them one by one back into inventory
As you do this you will see that the picture on the card shows a scene from each of the seven game episodes
Put the cards back on the counter in the order of the game episodes
Matching the black streak across them will help
Assembling the cards brings on a long concluding video
The final thing for you to do is use a pencil that has appeared in inventory to sign a contract and the game comes to a thoroughly unsatisfactory ending
The game goes to the credits and there is no way to access the bar at bottom of the menu page so you won t be able to get an entry for Giselle by Theodore in his notebook nor see any of the many pacts
Commentary At the conclusion of this game you are left with a myriad questions too numerous to cover completely concerning contradictions inconclusive endings and unanswered interpretations
A few of these follow some are trivial some are not
There have been plenty of areas for conjecture for just one instance Frank's contract with Mephistopheles allowed him one masterpiece is it a painting on a vast area of Giselle's skin
And one more does the very last scene show the collapse of Dreamland just after it has been sold
It is hard to see any connection between Goethe s Faust and Marcellus Faust perhaps none is intended
As you proceed through the game from Episode to you will note a date on the screen at the beginning of each
While game progression flows more or less smoothly from episode to episode it does not do so timewise
Several contradictions are indicated and in an attempt to understand what is happening in this story the accompanying time progression event table has been prepared based primarily on these episode beginning dates and a couple of times Episodes and within one
The characters listed come from the STARS menu preceding each episode one could argue about the correctness of this column
Mephisto and Marcellus are in each and Theo More in most TIMELINE TABLEDATEEVENTCHARACTERS Episode Frank Giselle Kalinka Episode Tod Hannibal Episode Hannibal Tod Kalinka Episode Kalinka Frank Twins Theo More Episode Twins Hannibal Son born to Frank and Kalinka Episode Alexi Episode Giselle Frank Frank s immolation Episode Part Episode Nathaniel Meister Return to Nathaniel s home Episode Part Theo More At the beginning of Episode in Giselle s exhibition room December the poster for Frank gives qualification as a freak is that his face has been burned in hell which happened in part of Episode in October
He refers to himself as a monster when talking to Kalinka in Episode in June At the end of Episode in June Tod wins Hannibal s debt to Nitty and also physically defeats him thus removing him as a threat
In March Episode Hannibal berates him using a whip The matches acquired from Nathaniel Meister s desk in December are used to light a candle in June Episode and to ignite a stove in June Episode The twins have a show poster in Giselle s place in Episode December but Jody killed Lily in Episode November The homunculus is introduced in part of Episode in July
It is needed and used in Episode June and Episode June
Why is the lottery ticket acquired in Episode carried in inventory throughout the game
It is never used What could possibly be the relevance of the old movie clips at the end of Episode
If the interpretation of the final exposition of Episode is understood correctly it was part of the Boss's plan to have Marcellus run the park
So the first thing he does is sell it to a conglomerate
After finishing the game one is left with the impression that several people were given an amorphous plot line a cast of characters and sent off separately to come up with parts which were then put together without much consultation
Perhaps the game suffers some in translation from the original European
There are too many discontinuities not enough closure
Upon the conclusion of this game and reflection on the several discussions and Mephisto's many expositions presented in the various episodes one might have the idea the authors have been expressing some philosophical ideas on the human condition a l aacute Goethe
Or not

When all are connected beeps will be heard
A short beep signifies an incorrect connection while a longer BEEEP means a correct connection
Therefore for example if you connect Input to Output Input to Output etc
and you hear beep BEEEP BEEEP beep then you know Input and Input must be correctly connected but Input and Input must be changed PLANET FILB Delores gives you aRemote Controlto operate SAM
Follow SAM to the gate at the entrance to the Village
Note that the villagers drop a Spear when they close the gate

WALKTHROUGH OF THE FILMMAKER by Hans Lamboo Holland The Filmmaker is a game in main Chapters I
The Shards II
The Killings III
The Movies IV
End game Unfortunately the game is technically instable
There's an error appearing every now and then talking about a missing file actually a part of active X needed for the scripting engine
This will occure mainly in the beginning and when using the main menu
It's drag but simply click it away and play on
Sometimes it makes your inventory disappear most often while playing The Movies The use of Flash is also making the game instable in the case of some puzzles
Still I liked the game very much
It has an original storyline and the way the movies fit in is really great
CHAPTER I THE SHARDS Watch the introduction video
The game will bring you to the theater automatically
Go to the main entrance
Explore
Only the doors left of the ticket booth are approachable
The doors have all kind of little squares which can be ticked
If you click one of the boxes on the door it will show a number

Note one of the bears carries a little key
You can't do anything more because you don't have any money

The Snack Bar Get behind the counter by walking to the curtains either on the left or right side of the snackbar then make a sharp turn left or right depends which way you approach the counter from

Therefore you need some nails or somethingto put in the little holes
So try later
Go back to the corridor and continue to walk it
There's one more door which is locked

You'll have to find out who worked when and operated which movie
That's a true mindcracker
There are some more clues scattered about the place
Collect them and try to solve the puzzle later
Left of the operating table is the projector
Look at it
It seems to be out of order
Behind the projector is a closet up the wall
Note the poster of the movie quot The Fuzzies quot
Someone wrote quot WED quot on it
Yet another clue to the Work Schedule Puzzle
Try to open the closet
It's locked
Right of the closet is a soundmixer
Take a look in the litterbox

So go back to the lobby
Go back to the Arcade Room

Manager's Office Open the door with the key from your inventory and walk in the room
Explore it
Find several notes and read them
The cinema seems to run very well thanks to Mr Ferucile's great movies
There's a clue about the weighter on the snackbar counter you only need a special weight to operate it
Note the books with puzzles in it
Apparently the Manager i c
Mr Todd Wickermann likes puzzles
The book explains how a so called quot logical puzzle quot can be solved by deduction
Hm looks like the Work Schedule in the Operator's Room doesn't it
Close to the door on the utter left side of the desk is a multi coloured cube
Yet another puzzle
This time it's not a really hard one
Try to get the square pieces in the right order
Follow the colours in the various pieces
If you do it right the cube opens up
Take Shard
Next to the computer screen are are redheaded pins
Take them
What for
To open up the hatch in the podium
In the right corner of the office is a Money Poster
Click on it and it reveals a wall safe
It appears to need a kind of colour code to open it
Since you haven't got a clue forget it for now
Take a look at the picture on the wall of the happy family
Let me introduce them to you The older man in the middle is Mr Todd Wickermann
The man is Eric the woman is Melanie
The girl is Heather and the boy is Jeremy
They all work in the theater
Leave the Manager's Room and go back to the lobby to the Snackbar
The Snack Bar Get behind the counter
Go to the weighter on the right side
How can I put something in the weighter's scale
Take the candy the M amp M's from your inventory
Use the scissors on it by dragging the scissors over the bag of candy
There's a bunch of loose candy in your inventory now
Try to put the candy in the weighter's scale
That doesn't work
What did the hint in the Manager's Office say
You need a special amount to use the weighter
Turn around
See the pile of paper cups
Take one
Turn back to the weighter
Put the paper cup next to the weighter on the counter
Poor the candy into the paper cup
Try to poor the candy form the cup into the scale
That doesn't work
Notice you still have candy left in your inventory after you put candy in the paper cup
Take the left over of the candy and put it inthe weighter's scale
A drawer opens
Take Shard
Now you have to go back to the Operator's room and try to solve the Work Schedule Puzzle

The Operator's Room In the Manager's Office you could read all about solving this kind of puzzles
There's a few things you know for sure
That could be positive or negative
So about some things you know what's right or what's wrong
Insert the positive items in the schedule as a dot
Use the cross for the items you are sure they are a no or are impossible
Insert them in the schedule
Read the hints aside the Work Schedule
They tell you more about what's right and what's wrong
Now what do we know for sure
Heather likes poems
Recall her letters
Heather works on Monday's her father ordered her to in a note she threw in the litterbox in the Operator's Room
On Monday quot Primal Atmosfear quot is showing
Jeremy likes videogames
He works on Wednesday's
On Wednesday's quot The Fuzzies quot are showing
Eric likes music
Remember the CD in the Operator's Room
Todd apparently likes puzzles as shown by the books in his office
That leaves Melanie to like to read books
So far the evident knowledge about the people
Now try to combine it with the hints next to the schedule
Write it down for yourself in a diagram
Who works on Monday
Who On Tuesday
Who can't possibly work on Thursday
Who could
Do the same thing for the movies
You know quot The Fuzzies quot play on Wednesday it was marked on the poster in the Operator's Room
According to the hints quot Primal Atmosfear quot is running Mondays
So what have you got
Heather gt poems gt Monday gt Primal Atmosfear Jeremy gt videogames gt Wednesday gt The Fuzzies On Thursdays it's neither quot Aliens quot nor quot The Count quot playing
and of course also not quot Primal quot or quot Fuzzies quot
So it has to be quot A Detective Story quot
Fill it out in the scedule with a cross
Keep testing your answers to the hints
This is the definite solution Monday gt Primal Atmosfear gt Heather gt Poems Tuesday gt Aliens from Mars gt Melanie gt Books Wednesday gt The Fuzzies gt Jeremy gt Video games Thursday gt Detective Story gt Eric gt Music Friday gt The Count gt Todd gt Puzzles The Operating Panel will open
Take Shard
Now go back to the lobby
The Shards Look at the ceiling of the lobby
Fit the pieces in their shadow parts
Now you have to put them together in the right way
Note this is a D puzzle
It's not the spot that's the problem It's the order in which you put the shards down
How can you tell you did something right
When you do you'll hear a sound like quot cloink quot
you put down the large rectangle at the left side you put down the little top
The smaller rectangle at the right
The large L shaped piece at the bottom left
The part with the two points
The small L shaped piece next to the large one Look at the video
This is the end of Chapter I
Chapter II THE KILLINGS The Operator's Room Go upstairs and open the closet
There are film reels in it
Take them
The reels are marked D C F A and P What should that mean
In the cinema movies were shown
So D stands for the Detective Story C theCount F theFuzzies A Aliens form Mars P Primal Atmosfear
Now you want to play the movies
Turn to the projector from the exit door's side
There is an action cursor on the projector
Click it
A small door opens and reveals a little box
It's empty
There's a little socket at the bottom
Obviously a part is missing
What could it be

Manager's Office back stage Enter the Manager's Office
Talk to Todd Wickerman's ghost voice
This will take some too much time
Note down the order the killings took place and where and in which movie each person is appearing

Eric on the catwalk gt Detective Story

Heather on stage gt The Fuzzies
Jeremy in the Arcade gt Aliens form Mars
Todd in his office gt Primal Atmosfear

Turn around
Watch the video
Go down to the cellar under the stage

Yes
Go to the space below the podium
Take the prop sword
You can now so why shouldn't you
Climb the ladder to the trapdoor in the podium
There's a loose brick on the left side
Click on it and take the crystal from it
Now turn to the hatch
To open it you have to solve a puzzle
You need to put something in the right holes so all lines will be lit
Take the four redheaded pins from your inventory and put them in the right holes
Which ones
Try a bit
It's not too difficult
Put a nail in the hole second from left in the top line Put a nail in the left whole on the second line Put a nail in the center hole Put a nail in the right hole on the bottom line

Watch the introduction
Once in the castle explore the hall
Notice the signs runes on the walls
Get in the door
Turn left at the candle and turn right
Here's a door markedII III
The door is locked
Turn left turn right turn left
There's another door
Get in
Click on the well in the middle
Listen to the message
Evil runes
What the heck
Walk around the well and walk into the next room a cave actually
You see quot Melanie quot floating in some sort of magic power field
Look for runes
There's on the walls indicating left and right
Note them down
Look in the little cave at the left
There's a stand with a crystal on it
Take it
Leave this room
Outside turn right step forward and turn left step forward again and turn left
There's the door markedII III
It's still locked
Turn back right step foward turn right again
There's a double door
It's open
So get in
This is the Puzzle Room
Explore
At the right you see a text next to it is a book
Read the book
Note down the properties of good and bad runes
If a rune contains a curve or a triangle it's good
If there's an even number of good properties in a rune then it's evil
If a rune contains a V with a vertical line through it in the center the rune is evil if there are also any good properties in it
If there are no good properties the rune with a V and a line through it is always evil
If there are or more lines in a rune it will be the opposite of what it normally would be
This information comes in handy in solving a puzzle later on
Turn left
In front of you are squares on the wall
See anything special
The left one has a signIabove it the middle one is markedIIand the right oneIII
Hm
Where did I see that again
On the locked door in the corridors markedII III
Now turn around twice
See the sign above the entry doors
It'sIV
In case you shouldn't know what these signs mean there's a poster on the wall that explains it
These are Roman numbers
Turn back to the wall and step foward to the left square
Now you can see it's composed of tiles
They all have the signIVon it
Now click on any tile
Find out they all can change inI IIorIII
What could be the meaning
Try to turn all tiles intoII's
It's not hard but it takes some trial and error
If you succeed there's a snapping sound
Step backward and turn to the square markedII
Now there's a puzzle in the square
It contains tiles
Click one and it turn into a cross
Click the same tile again and it will turn into a question mark
Click it once more and it's empty again
In case you don't know what to do keep clicking tiles
At a certain moment you'll hear a blasting sound and tiles spread all over the square show skulls
Game over start again
In case you still don't know what to do press the help button
It explains a lot
And yes your deepest fears come true OMG it's a freaking minesweeper game
Blast
A bore and a drag and not very original
As you might remember from the minesweeper game you have to click on all tiles NOT hiding a skull
If you click a tile twice it will either reveal a skull or a Roman number
The number will tell you how many skulls are next horizontal vertical and diagonal to that tile
Every time the game is over there's a new game
At random
So it's no use taking notes
This puzzle only takes time and a lot of patience
Besides is utterly boring
Tip try to find a couple of empty tiles first
These are tiles that are not next to a skull tile but at the edges of an empty area the tiles will tell you how many skull tiles are at it's borders
Tip use the cross and the question mark to help you identify the skull tiles
Eventually you will succeed
There's a snapping sound again
Is puzzle numberIIIrevealed
No it isn't
How did you reveal puzzle numberII
Right by putting all tiles in puzzle numberItoII's
So go back to puzzleIen now set all tiles to numberIII
A click will tell the puzzle emerged
Now you can go to puzzle numberIII
Inside a square are T's
Try some
You can take each one out put them aside
And turn them
If you take them all out you'll see there's a smaller square inside the outline
Goal of the puzzle is to fit in the T's into the smaller square
Never mind the writing on the wall quot T's also fit the smaller square quot
That's a fake hint
You really have to fit all T's in the smaller inner square
This is a tricky one a true mindcrusher
You also have to be very precize because if a T touches another one or the outline it will jump out again
Any ideas
Did you notice you can also put the T's in an angle a kind of skewed way
There's the solution
Put one T upside down and put the long bar in the left upper corner in such an angle that the point of the short bar just touches the outline
Put another T on it's side and fit it in at the upper outline
And so on
The solution looks like this Now you'll hear a snapping sound again
You've solved puzzleIIand puzzleIII
The snapping sounds apparantly opened something
Something with II andIII
Right the door in the corridor markedII III
Get out
But help
The exit door is locked
How can you open things in the puzzle room
Remember how puzzleIlooked when you first saw it
Remember the marking above the exit door IV
So put all tiles of puzzleIonIV
The exit door opens
You're ready and done with in the puzzle room
Go back to the door markedII III
Guess what
It's open
Walk in
It's a kind of crypt
Right in front is a coffin DON'T TOUCH IT
You want to touch it anyway
At your own responsability
The lid opens and you can look inside the coffin
There's The Count actually a vampire
The cursor changes into an action cursor
What could you put on a vampire to kill him
You have only one items in your inventory that can help you
It rsquo s the necklace
But you'll need three more
The first is garlic
You rsquo ll find that in The Fuzzies
The second is a wooden pole to put through his heart
You'll find that in Primal Atmosfear
The third is daylight
If it takes too long the vampire will open his eyes and gets you
So only go back if you have all the needed items
Walk around the coffin and go into the cave behind it
There's a carving of runes but not all of them are runes
Remember the runes you've found on the wall of the other cave
Still got the drawings
One represents the sign for Right and the other for Left
What else do you know about runes
Remember the voice in the well
What did it say
quot Press the evil runes quot
How can you tell a good from an evil one
Check the notes you made from the book in the puzzle room
Replace them by the suitable runes you copied from the wall
So replace Riii by the sign for right
Do the same with the runes for Left
Now judge the runes
Which ones are evil
Here rsquo s the solution Press the rune that looks like a reversed
Press Ri
Press Riii Press Liii
Daylight will come into the room that comes in handy when killing the vampire
The stone reveals a new clue
Riii Li Rii Or three times right one time left two times right
What's the hint for
You don't know yet
Walk to the crypt's exit
Note the trunk that's right next to the exit
It's locked

THE FUZZIES Watch the introduction
You can't get passed the doorman
He asks for a quot shiny shiny quot
What could that mean
Give him the grey stone you got from behind the brick below the stage in the cinema
Go to the next Fuzzie who is also asking for quot shiny shiny quot
You have one gem left in your inventory the blue one from the cave in The Count
But he doesn't accept that one
So find out which Fuzzie does
If you've found the right Fuzzie he rsquo ll give you a riddle
RIDDLE
What's the beginning of eternity The end of time and space The beginning of each end And the end of every race
Does it make sense
In a way
Perhaps you don't have to understand the words
Maybe you have to take it all literally
So look at them
What's the beginning of eternity
Right the letter e That's also the last letter of quot time quot and quot space quot
The first one of quot end quot
And the last one of quot race quot
That was easy
Typ in e for an answer
The Fuzzie will give you another stone or quot shiny shiny quot
Find out which Fuzzie likes this particular gem
RIDDLE
Two donkeys stand in straight line One in front the other behind Behind the second one stands I Somewhere in the middle I lie A whole nation exists behind me Find the answer and you'll be free
Take this one literally as well
Another word for donkey
Right ASS
So write down ASS and put the other donkey behind it
So now you've got ASS ASS
Behind that stands and I
So now you've got ASS ASS I
The next hint is a lie so skip that one
Now put quot a whole nation quot behind that
ASS ASS I NATION
That's your answer to this riddle
ASSASSINATION
You'll get another gem and must find the next Fuzzie
RIDDLE
Five hundred begins it five hundred ends it Five in the middle is seen First of all figures the first of all letters Take up their station between Join all together and you will bring Before you the name of an eminent king

But what to do with quot five hundred quot
We've seen Roman numbers before
What's quot five hundred quot in Roman numbers
You can go back to the puzzle room in The Count and read it on the poster
The answer isD
So you've gotDat the beginning as well as the end
That makesD D
In the middle there's a five
So aV
Now you've gotD V D kind of funny huh
What's the first of all figures
Of the Roman figures

The answer isSTARTLING
Take the gem
There are no Fuzzies left
So what to do with this last gem
Find Heather
She's crying
Talk to her
But that gets you nowhere
Notice there are little plants in front of Heather
Find the garlic and take it
Hm
Garlic
That might come in handy in killing a vampire
Go to the exit
But you can't get out yet
You have to do one more thing
But what
Look at the waterwell
There's an action cursor
Something has to be thrown into the well
Try everything from your inventory
But you haven't got it yet
Click INTERMISSION
You're back at the projector
Put on Aliens from Mars now the reel marked A
ALIENS FROM MARS Watch the introduction
Explore the spaceship
There's not very much you can do
Where you begin go to the left
There's an action cursor on the machine at the bottom of the screen
Click it look at it and remember it's location
Turn around and step on the captain's platform
Step forward
There's a message in the communication device on the wall
Click it
Listen to the Martian
The captain will order you to man the arm system
Turn left
There's an action cursor on the screen
Click it
It's all about gems
Click one and read the discriptions
This comes in handy in solving the gem riddle in The Fuzzies
Go back to where you stepped on the platform
Now go straight ahead
See the action cursor
Click it and get closer to the arm system
Click on 'Target' for exemple
The captain will tell you what to do first
lsquo Reroutethe power rsquo
Go back to the machine in the backroom where you started
Study the screen
There's only one thing you can do
It's a very small hot spot
It's the word at the bottom right 'Reroute Power'
Ain't that what the captain ordered you to do first
Click it
The machine will ask you for a power crystal
Do you have it
Yes you've got an item that could be it
You got it from a Fuzzie
It's yellow and red
Put the gem in the socket
Click 'Reroute power' again
That's better
But what's that
Another puzzle
Click 'HELP' and read it
You can connect power sources A B C and D by clicking on the dark area in between the tiles
There's one big 'BUT the connection lines are not to cross or touch each other
Help
It's a matter of trial and error
You'll find out how to do it
In case not here's the solution Note the line in the bottom left to E is missing
The only way I could take a picture
You have to put it in yourself
Go back to the weapon system on the platform in front of the big screen
Now follow the instructions and fight the Martians
You have to beat them all
Eventually the captain will cheer and disappear
On his chair are some explosives
Take them
Over the chair is a white cloud
Take some item that is connected to Jeremy to put into the white cloud
Of course it's his joystick
You've finished Aliens from Mars
You're back in the lobby
Only films left
THE FUZZIES Go back to the Operator's Room and put on The Fuzzies again
Remember you're almost done whith this grumpy creatures
There was only one thing left You've got to throw something in the well
How about some sweet dynamite
Put the explosives in the well
But they don't work
In movies you always have to set fire to a fuse wire
It's on the right
Take the matches from your inventory and click on the fuse wire
A big blast and all the Fuzzies are blown to Fuzzie Heaven
Only the lit white cloud remains
Put in something that is connected to Heather
Right the letter from your inventory
You've finished The Fuzzies too
You're back in the lobby
Only two more films to go
PRIMAL ATMOSFEAR Go back to the Operator's Room and put on Primal Atmosfear the reel marked P Watch the introduction
This movie is very difficult to navigate through
Pay good attention to the position of the arrow cursor
It's very hard to discribe your steps exactly
So first give it a try yourself
Nasty part is when you come onto a path where the monster gets you
And there's nothing you can do about it
Yet
You only have got a prop sword
But you have to know where the monster's soft spot is
You don't know yet
It's in a book in crypt of the vampire count
But you've got to kill the Count first
There's a lot of wood here so you might find just the piece you need
Eventually you will get to a little house more of a shed
Explore it
Listen to the radio
Read the book
There's an action cursor on the bed but there's nothing there
What the heck I try to give you the right steps to get there forward left forward twice left THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ONE
Here you can turn left or right but also forward
Notice you can click forward left as well as right of the tree
Click the RIGHT forward cusor
forward right forward x That's where the shed is
Turn around so the shed is behind you
forward x left forward Now that's where the monster is
So don't make another step forward or it will get you
right forward left forward right forward left forward twice right forward x You'll come to a fence with a head on it
It's poor Todd's
Turn around so the fence is behind you
forward x left forward x left forward There's a tree
In front of it is a piece of wood with a pointy side
Take it
This is a good place to save your game
Now click INTERMISSION
THE COUNT Change the filmreels put on The Count again
Go to the crypt behind the door markedII III Step forward to the coffin
Click it
It will open
Now don't start clicking about or the Count will wake up and gets you
Instead give him something of Melanie first
You still have here necklace in your inventory
That doesn't work
Because you have to rub it with garlic first
Then put the necklace on the count's hands
Then put the piece of wood from the tree in Primal Atmosfear and click on the vampire
He'll die for sure
He disappears
On the bottom of the coffin is a key
Take it
Now where can we use the key
In the trunk next to the exit of the cave
Put the key in the keyhole
Notice there are two arrow curors appearing one to the left one to the right
Apparently you have to turn the key in a special way
Hmmm
Remember the code from the rune stone
Riii Li ndash Rii
Click the right cursor three times then the left one once and the right one twice
Now click on the key
The trunk opens
There's a book in it
Read it
It tells you how to kill the monster from Primal Atmosfear
Go back to the room where Melanie is floating
She's in the known white cloud now
Give her something to end this movie
But what
Give her Eric's comb
That finishes The Count as well
You're back in the lobby
Only one film to go

PRIMAL ATMOSFEAR Go find the monster
Kill it with your sword
Then go back to Todd's head on the fence
It's in the white cloud now
To finished the movie put something in the cloud that belonged to Todd
Put the money in there
You're back in the lobby
All movies finished

FERUCIL So now what
There's only one room you haven't been able to enter so far in the game
Because the door has been locked all the time
The door produced a strange noise and showed a flashing light when you tried to open it
It's back stage
In the cellar
Go to that room
The door is unlocked now
It's dark
Step forward
Use the torch from the inventory
Explore the room
It's where the heater is
And also a burned corpse probably Ferucil's
Search it
Next to the body is Ferucil's staff
Take it
You can use something on the door of the heater
But what
The staff might work
But it lacks a sharp edge
Don't go and search for it
Remember how Ferucil uses the staff to cut people
There's a sharp knife inside the staff
Put the magnifying glass over the staff in your inventory
There's an action cursor on the staff's head
Click it
The knife will come out
Now use the staff on the heater's door again
There's something burning in there
But you can't take it out it's too hot
Don't use your bare hands
Put on the glove
Get the film reel that was burning there
It's marked H What could that be
So off you go to the Operator's Room
To play the Grand Finale
But both stairs to the podium are blocked by rocks
Fortunately you know about the trap door in the podium
So use that to get out of the cellar
That rsquo s the end of Chapter III
CHAPTER IV THE END GAME In the Operator's Room put on the film marked H Watch the introduction
Now you know where H stands for HELL
Follow the road
Go to the tower
The doors are locked
Turn right
There's the lock a puzzle
How does it work
Turn left
Look upwards
There's a clue TRAVERSE ALL PATHS WITHOUT BACKTRACKING Now turn right to the lock again
That's not too difficult
Go down one bit
Then take the left side of the outer ring
When it stops at the bottom go up once
Then take the left of the inner ring
When it stops at the top take the right half of the inner ring
When it stops at the bottom go straight up
Take one more step up
Then take the right side of the outer ring
When it stops at the bottom go one step downwards
The doors will open

THE MAZE Now be careful don't be hasty
Look at the hall
In front of you is a single door
Look upwards
There's a clue on the wall
IN TIME ALL WILL BE REVEALED WHEN YOU MOVE FORWARD
Note the door is marked C At the left there are two doors marked A and F at your right there are two doors marked D and P Hmm
Doesn't that remind you of something
Right those were the names of the black amp white films
Step into door C That looks familiar doesn't it
It's the set from The Count
But in full color this time
Turn left the only way
Step forward right forward left and forward again
There's a drawing on the wall
It's a grid with red tiles
Copy it
Turn left and exit
And you're back where you came from
In the hall
Note the door in fornt of you is the door to the exit into into hell
So step forward and turn around
Turn left and take the door marked D Indeed that's the set of The Detective Story
Look at the desk
Another grid with blue tiles
Copy it
Turn right and exit
Back in the hall again
This time the door in front of you is door C So turn left and take the door marked P That leads into Primal Atmosfear
You can only go forward
You'll see a tower
Above the door is another grid in pink
Copy it
Go throught the door
Back in the hall take the door marked A
Hey you're back in space
There's nothing you can do so walk to the wall in the back
Click the screen and you'll get another grid
Turn right
Press the button next to the door and exit
Back in the hall
Now take the only door left the door marked F Hohohoho back in Fuzzieland
Walk to the door in the rear
On the wall are two drawings
One is a grid
Copy it
There's another hint
Yellow Red makes Orange in case you didn't know
Blue yellow makes green
Go throught the door
You're back in the hall
Now what
Whatever door you take it takes you back to the hall
There might be some kind of clue to get out of here
Maybe it's in the order you pass through the different films
Can you think of any
Use the order in which the killings took place in the theater

Eric The Detective Story
Melanie The Count
Heather The Fuzzies
Jeremy Aliens form Mars
Todd Primal Atmosfear Now walk through the doors in this order D C F A P Guess what
You're in another hall
THE MARBLE amp THE GRIDS On one wall is a kind of grid box
The text on it reads COLORS COMBINE TO FORM COLOR ANEW And at the bottom OVERLAPS NEGATE On one wall is a closed door
On the other wall is a toy with a rolling marble
Press the red button
The marble doesn't come very far does it
That's because it can't go down
There's a couple of wooden bridges avoiding that
The first one is slightly pink the second one is orange
The last one is green
Now turn to the grid box
There must be a connecting between the two
Remember the first wooden bridge is pink
Do you have something with a pink grid
You sure do
Take the copy you made of the pink grid
Now press the tiles that should be pink
Now press the button
You'll here a click
Turn to the marble roller again
The pink bridge is down now
The next bridge is orange
Go back to the grid box
For orange you need two colors
Right red and green
Take the yellow grid you copied
Press the boxes that should be yellow
Next take the red one
Press the boxes that should be red
Noting happens
Beware it reads 'Overlaps negate'
So click away the tiles that are red as well as yellow
You'll hear a click again
The orange bridge is down too
Now the green bridge
If you put the green grid in the grid box and press the button nothing happens
If you put the blue and the yellow grid in the box overlaps negate
nothing happens when you press the button
Now what
There's a nasty trick here
You can't hardly figure this out by yourself
You have to put all three colors in the grid
So blue yellow the green one
Overlaps negate
Now press the button and the green bridge is also down
Go to the marble roller and press the button
The marble slowly rolls down
You'll hear a click
The exit door is open

THE DEMON Step outside the door
Walk the path
At the end of the path there will be a demon coming from below
Climb the monster by following the arrow cursor
Step into it's mouth
You'll fall down into it's guts
In front of yet another locked door

THE SKULLS Take a look around
Anything to open the door with
Hey some of the skulls in the walls have red eyes
And you can press them and they will go out
If you've found all the skulls with red eyes and put them all out you'll hear a sound
No it's not the door unlocking
It's behind you
Step out of the cave
In front is a kind of golden statue
You can't open it
On top is a kind of strange diagram with a couple of colored skulls beneath it
You don't know what to do yet
So turn around
In front of the cave's entrance is a heap of skulls
If you press one on a certain skull the eyes will light up and you'll hear a sound
Press any other skull and you will hear a bleating sound meaning 'game over'
So what could that mean
It's a matter oforder
Press any skull
Note which skull's eyes light up
Press that skull
The eyes will turn red again
After that the eyes of another skull will light up
Remember that order
Now press the first skull and the second one
The skulls will repeat that and add another skull lighting it's eyes
Press the first skull again then the second and the third one
The skulls will repeat that order and add one new skull
You rsquo ll have to remember the order of skulls
If you do it right you win the game
Beware sometimes a skull has to be pressed twice
Since this is a randow game I can't give you any more hints
It's a matter of trial and error and of recalling the right order
When you finished this game you'll hear a click again
So walk back into the cave
Go to the door in the back
No it's not open
But there's a skull hanging in front of it
It needs something to be be put in it
So turn around and walk out of the cave again
Turn to the heap of skulls again
Left next to it is an action cursor
Click on it
The rock will open revealing a piece of paper
Read it
The paper contains a lot of hints and restrictions about the placements of some things
Might be skulls
Copy the paper
Turn around and climb the golden statue again
Look at the grid on the top
There are circles connected by lines
Beneath that are skulls with different colors
Got the message
Put the colored skulls in the right way in the grid
OMG
This is truly HELL It's a real mindcrusher
It almost drove me mad
It took me months to solve it
But I did
Look at all the hints and restrictions
You've got names colors and positions
It resembles the puzzle with the work schedule in the operator's room
So start working on it
Which name is what color
Which skull should not be where
Biro rede Irina blue Sari green Jenj orange Cryd purple Phera yellow Sephino pink Rarpine white Now make a list which colors should be next to each other or not
I can't give you any more clues
So here's the solution PINK PURPLE BLUE YELLOW GREEN WHITE RED The door under the puzzle opens
Inside is a little key
Take it
Climb down the statue and go into the cave again
Go to the door in the back
Take the key from the golden statue and put it in the skull in front of the door
The door will open
Step outside in the white light

THE STORY OF FERUCIL You're in a field
Follow the arrows
Find the cane
The landscape will turn into a gloomy one
Follow the arrows
Meanwhile listen to Ferucil's story
Eventually you'll come to a wall with some graffiti on it
SAVE YOUR GAME
Do so

THE KILLING OF FERUCIL Step out and you're inside the theater again
This time it's Ferucil on the podium
You have to find a machine backstage
With yet another puzzle
Solve it and a device will give you the magic gem that belongs on top of the staff
With that you can finally kill Ferucil
There are only a few minutes to spend
So you have to be fast
At first you won't manage to do what's needed
Because you can't find your way to the machine
Because you don't know how to solve the puzzle
Because you don't know how to put the gem on the staff
Because you don t know how to get back in front of the podium to kill Ferucil with his own cane
Don't worry there are endless tries possible
As soon as Ferucil ended his little speech the arrow cursor emerges
Go forward
Right
Left
Forward
Left
Forward twice
Up the stairs
Left
Forward
Turn left
There's the machine with the puzzle
Get closer
There are black balls connected with red beams
In the middle are slightly red dots
You have to set light to all dots
By moving the black circles in such a way that the beams hit all dots
It's not hard
After you succeeded the machine will produce a gem
Take it
Put it on top of the staff in your inventory
Now run back to the front of the podium and face Ferucil
Throw the staff towards him
He'll die
Enjoy the tail bit of the game
It rsquo s kind of Happy Ending
Is it

Enter it
Walk past the faded core and go down the stairs
Enter the main hall and walk straight forward onto the blue balcony
Walk to the left
Press the button on the stand in front of the planetarium

Head back to the plateau with the three strange devices once more
Notice that the center device also has a dotted drawing now
The center device with the dotted piece of paper Turn the valve of this center device to lower the upper part
Do the same with the left most device
Leave the right most alone
Notice that four masts with mirrors will rise from the water
If nothing happens check to see wether the two devices at the left side are lowered and the right most one is up
IMPORTANT NOTE You must align the masts first before you go back inside
If you go inside now without having aligned the masts you will be stuck inside the cabin forever
So be sure to do the next steps before you go back inside
Walk onto the platform with the four valves
These valves operate the masts with the mirrors in the water
All four mirrors have to be aligned pointing to the center mast with the lenses
Turn the left most valve twice
Turn the second valve from the left three times leave the third valve alone and finally turn the right most valve once
If done correctly the light on top of each mast will be lit white and so is the light behind the lens at the center mast

Remember this as clock number
Turn to the left and keep on walking forward
At the intersection go to the right
Keep on walking until you reach another concrete block with the same sort of clock
Remember this as clock number
Turn to the left and keep on walking forward
At the end of the gangway notice the opened entrance of a room against the rock
Enter the room
Look very closely at the drawing on the wall
Not only gives this vital clues about the clocks but also about the lever s you have to flip
The squares at the right side on the drawing represent the four clocks you have seen
Notice that only with the clocks number and are drawn some green dots
The green circle around the little lever and the arrow beneath it pointing down to the power schedule can only mean that only those three clocks have to be set to get the correct amount of power
Flip down the grey lever
Exit the room
The drawing with some vital clues Turn to the left and step onto the gangway
At the first clock you reach which you had to remember as clock number set the dial to the eight o'clock position
At the intersection go to the right
Keep on walking to the end
Enter the room at your left side
Flip down the grey lever
Also flip down the little brown handle at the right side of the device as instructed on the drawing you saw in the first room
Exit the room
As soon as you are standing outside the room pan to the right to see another some sort of clock on the concrete block
Leave this one alone
Walk towards the gangway at your right side
Step onto the gangway and keep on walking until you reach the intersection
Walk straight forward
Set both of the clocks you pass which you had to remember as clock number and number to the eight o'clock position too
Keep on walking forward until you reach the plateau with the submarine cabin
Notice the control lights at the left side of the cliff
If you have done everything correctly before the control lights should be lights green light orange and red lights
So it should look like this The correct light by the submarine Climb up the stairs to the submarine
Open the door and enter the submarine
Pull the handle and enjoy the ride and the splash down
When you reach the blue core at the bottom of the sea pull the handle once more to set course to another part of the island
When the eagle has landed o open the hatch to step outside
Walk towards the bright beaming light to get beamed to another part of the island once more
Walk forward until you reach the plateau where you see three different pathways made of concrete blocks
Step onto the left most pathway
Keep on walking until you reach the next plateau
Notice the three wooden stands
Click on each of them until they all are lit green
Walk further and also set these two wooden stands to lit green
Go up and walk towards the table with the opened book
Read the book and turn the page
Turn around and walk towards the wooden blocks with symbols on them
Notice that some of the blocks don't show any symbol
This can only mean that the side with the symbol is facing down
The problem is that there is no way to turn these blocks
So no symbols for those ones
Make a note of the order of all blocks that don't show a symbol and of those that do show a symbol
Also make a note of those symbols
Walk all the way back to the starting point
When you reach the plateau that leads to the beaming point notice the strange device at the right side of it
Walk towards that strange device
The strange device next to the beaming point Turn the handle of the strange device to hear five different tones
I guess that rings a bell with you Yep you have to replay these tones in the correct order a little later
Turn around and step back unto the plateau
Step onto the right most pathway
Walk all the way to the end
Now you are facing the organ on which you have to replay the tones you just heard on the strange device
And not only that
You also have to note the corresponding symbol that will be projected briefly on the right most rock
The correct order of playing the keys of the organ is and
These are the corresponding symbols projected on the rock The symbol corresponding to tone The symbol corresponding to tone The symbol corresponding to tone The symbol corresponding to tone The symbol corresponding to tone Walk back to the starting point
This time step onto the center pathway
Walk all the way to the end
Notice the faded crystal
Also notice the huge wooden dials at the right side
Your goals of course is to set those dials in the correct order
I don't give you the number of how many times you have to press each and every dial
Why
Simply because it often happens that if you press one dial the dial next to it will be moved too
In stead of that I give you the images of the correct symbols on all of the dials from the left to the right
Dial number Dial number Dial number Dial number Dial number Dial number Dial number Dial number Dial number Dial number If done correctly the blue core will be lit
If not check the dials to see if one or more have been moved to a wrong setting as I mentioned before
Walk towards the blue core and touch it to return to the island in front of the submarine cabin
The Third yellow Core Walk forward and go to the left
Near the first concrete block go to the right
Go up the stairs leading up into the direction of the watchtower
Turn to the left and keep on walking forward over the cliffs until you are facing the door to the watchtower
Open the door and go inside
Don't step onto the wooden elevator platform yet
Instead of that look closely to the floor beneath and besides the platform
There are some hardly to see drawings of some sort on the floor
And not only that but you can only see a part of the drawings
To get a clear view is easier done than said o Step onto the platform
Pull the chain
As soon as the platform starts to move up quickly turn around so you are facing the door and step down the platform
With the departed elevator you have a clear view on the floor
Make a note of the drawings on the floor
IMPORTANT NOTE When you pull the chain make sure you step off the Watchtower elevator platformfacing the door If you accidentally step off facing into the watchtower you will be unable to leave this area to recall the elevator and you will be stuck in the backside of the Watchtower forever
Thanks Leland O'Donnell for this note
The drawings on the revealed floor Great now you have a clear view on the floor but no elevator and no button to call the elevator
Well just step outside which does call down the elevator platform
Go back inside and step onto the elevator platform
Pull the chain once more and this time make the ride up
After the elevator has stopped turn around and walk outside
Walk to the right and notice that the third wooden ball with the arrow to the right on it cannot be moved
This must be the starting point
With the drawing of the arrows beneath the elevator platform in mind you might think piece of cake
Well not completely
Notice that on the drawing there are some arrows that don't just point to the right left up or down
Some of the arrows are pointing down to the left down to the right up to the left and up to the right
And these balls do only have arrows pointing to the right left up and down
To simulate an arrow point down to the left you have to turn the corresponding ball so that you see an arrow pointing to the left and an arrow pointing down
You will see what I mean on the next images of how to set the balls correctly
The immovable starting point The easy pointing up arrow The simulated pointing down to the left arrow The simulated pointing down to the right arrow The simulated pointing up to the left arrow The easy pointing to the left arrow The easy pointing down arrow The simulated pointing up to the right arrow Job done
Re enter the watchtower

At the intersection go to the right
On the next wooden platform go forward

So no use yet to go there
In stead of that keep on going forward
Cross the wooden platform and go forward
At the intersection go to the left
On the next wooden platform walk to the end of it and go down the stairs
At the bottom walk towards the fence at the back

The image of the miller will be placed on some kind of board in a hidden room
Later on you have to do this same trick with another three paintings
When you talk to a painting it tells you a riddle
Note down the riddle and that it belongs to the miller
Based on those riddles you have to place the corresponding persons on the correct sign on the board
The only difficult thing is that those riddles can differ from game to game
At the end of this walkthrough I'll give you the riddles with the correct answers that I encountered in my games
Go upstairs and go to the right
Use the green amulet on the painting of the fisherman
Talk to the fisherman and note down the riddle and that it belongs to the fisherman

Notice that the miller the fisherman and the hermit are standing on the board
Also notice that the princess is broken and stands in the corner of the room
You have to take the place of the princess
I guess you can imagine that these persons aren't standing on the correct symbols right now
When you left click on one of the persons on the board it softly starts glowing red
You can move him than to the appropriate place on the board by clicking on the correct symbol
Notice that there are these symbols on the board
By solving the riddles you know which person has to be placed on which symbol
When you have done this correctly the eyes of the statue start to glow and the secret door to the prison cell will be opened
I give you one example If the riddle of the painting of the miller was quot Watch out boy my face is made of gold you need me to live so or you have been told
I am nice and I am round I can warm your bones and I can warm the ground quot you have to place the miller on the symbol of the sun
And for example if the riddle of the painting for the princess was quot I do not carry a flame yet I light the darkest night always changing but ever the same I can make the shadows bright quot you have to step on the symbol of the moon
Here are some of the riddles and the solution I encountered in my game quot Run mortal run you don't have a clue find yourself a hiding place or I'll sprinkle you
Though I have no support I sit upon high
You can't reach me unless you can fly quot Cloud quot I look like easy prey but touch me and I'll slip away
Water is my greatest home try to catch me and I'm gone quot Fish quot Fallen from the sky yet it belongs here hold it in your hand you will see it's tear
Lying in the dirt but still crystal clear next year it returns you don't have to fear quot Snow quot Watch out boy my face is made of gold you need me to live so or you have been told
I am nice and I am round I can warm your bones and I can warm the ground quot Sun quot Standing on the hill I will protect you enemies will fall and their children too I can survive centuries I am made of stone I can even guard the King's golden throne quot Castle quot I do not carry a flame yet I light the darkest night always changing but ever the same I can make the shadows bright quot Moon quot I can be used to punish and to bring people pain
But I can if so wish help them to walk again quot Cane quot I don't even remember how old I am how many times I saddened spring cheered me up again
To how many creatures have I offered my shade
I give food to others yes this is my fate quot Tree quot The flowers are crouching but it's too late
What is it rolling what is their fate quot Wheel quot Slipping through your fingers or sitting by the sea you can't hear my ticking but your timekeeper I'll be
You can sink into me I can kill you man if you need some mortar I can help you then quot Sand quot I'm not bound to the ground I like to fly up and around
My house is up on high now hear me sing and cry quot Bird quot Endless untainted dome trimmed by whitest foam Cradle of all life graveyard of all tears deepest abyss of them all bluish it appears quot Sea Attention
At the beginning of part two you can pick up some sorrel leaves
Does anybody know what to do with these sorrel leaves

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
FRANKENSTEIN Through the Eyes of the Monster Personal Observations amp Walkthrough by Soren Andersen Frankenstein is not a particularly linear game
There is very very much traveling through a multitude of possible paths in Dr Frankenstein's castle and grounds with its many rooms hallways secret passages and tunnels mazes and doors that will open at times and will not at other times and this path complexity increases the farther you get into the game
There is no doubt a most efficient pattern to accomplish the many tasks that must be done to rescue the monster and his daughter from the clutches of Frankenstein but the available path variations are so numerous that this is difficult to determine
As in any Adventure game there are of course many items that you must find and tasks that you must perform before you can do others but they do not necessarily follow closely upon each other
There is a very complete game playing instruction book on the disk however I think a few extra words about the cursors might be in order
The right and left pointing hands normally turn you in the direction of the pointing finger but on occasion the turn is and it is up to you to determine if that is the case in addition these cursors are used to withdraw from a closeup in which case there is no turn at all
The forward movement cursors are also pointing hands either slightly left or right not straight ahead furthermore the angle away from straight ahead is not always the same and may take you to a different location
You have to move the cursor slowly across the screen to detect this when it occurs
A case in point is the long pool in the castle courtyard
Despite the game rsquo s age I played it on Windows XP with only one problem at one point large chunks of ore are to be run through a pair of crushers until you get a full load of crushed ore in a cart ndash mdash something that you need to continue the game mdash and I was unable to get any rocks to show up on the crusher conveyor belt to be pulverized by the two manually operated sequential hammers
I bring this up because I have been in contact with several other gamers who experienced this same anomaly and at least one was using Windows
In some frustration while the empty belt was running in front of me I began idly and alternately operating the hammers and suddenly three rocks appeared mdash ndash shaken loose as it were moving along and ready to be crushed
Repeating this and occasionally turning the conveyor belt off and on eventually mdash and that is the operative word mdash got me the cartload of crushed ore
It is to be hoped that you will not encounter this difficulty or if you do that this unorthodox solution will work
The inventory is not very extensive many items are used almost immediately in which case they accompany your cursor until applied
Not too long into the game you acquire a valise to carry the few items that need to be transported
Most of these consist of various notes that turn up in a great variety of places those that may be collected are stored in the valise in a single sheaf and you must leaf through it if you wish to review them
Be sure and read these notes as you find them because while many of them are of little import others contain information that has much relevance to the conduct of the game
There are several instances in which the need for haste is expressed or implied but the only one where I found this to be actually the case is at the series of ladders found beyond gate II or if someone is gunning for you Setting of gauges does not have to be all that precise There seems to be a particular piece of music for each of the various locations mdash a leitmotif as it were mdash and fortunately none of these is so loud as to interfere with any speech Throughout the game there are comments by Frankenstein but mostly by you the monster some of these are indications of what must be done some are explanatory and some gratuitous frequently maudlin
Saving games can be something of a problem
At the time that the game was developed Windows file names were limited to eight characters no spaces and since the filename listing in the folder where the games are stored is alphamerical I chose to fill the first two places with a number in order to keep the list in time action sequence leaving only a restrictive six for some sort of abbreviation
My solution was to use the six as inventively as I could and to keep a separate cross reference text list in which I could describe the game storage situation without any limitation
One can in fact use the six character descriptor more than once since it will have a different sequence number
Games are stored in C INTRPLAY FRANKIE with an STA extension and using Windows Explorer to access them you can manipulate them as any file such as delete or rename
There are several places where you may be killed so as in any Adventure game you should save often
As indicated above there are a multitude of different paths through the castle and its environs and the following walkthrough is but one of these
It is easy to loose track of where you are in the passages and hallways inasmuch as the views are frequently identical so I have made several diagrams to assist in keeping track of your progress
Reference to these drawings will greatly facilitate your progress through the walkthrough and you may well wish to employ them even though you are not using the walkthrough although some annotations may be regarded as spoilers
You will note that the hallways and passages contain unevenly spaced dots these are endpoints of the forward steps as you pass along these corridors
There is a lot of gaming on just one disk
And it is pretty good
Soren Andersen May Walkthrough The game begins as do most Adventure games with an introductory video to establish some story background
The time is the latter part of the nineteenth century and with lightning flashing over Frankenstein's castle a narrator states that you Phillip Werren have been accused of murdering your daughter Gabrielle protesting your innocence you have been found guilty and hanged with your body torn apart by an outraged mob
You then come back to consciousness looking up at a ceiling with Dr Frankenstein leaning over you and congratulating himself on creating life
He gives you a shot of something that ldquo will make you feel better rdquo then gives himself one
The cursor appears click and one of your arms comes into view click again and the other arm shows mdash to your horror Frankenstein has given you a woman rsquo s arm
One more click and the doctor is at a control panel urging you to stand which you do finding yourself in a laboratory in Frankenstein's castle
This room where you have returned to life is the Resurrection Laboratory
As indicated in the subtitle you are playing this game in the persona of the just brought back to life ldquo monster rdquo
There is much equipment around shelves with vials and flasks a greenboard with notations a large chart of the periodic table a skeleton many books
You are free to explore and examine and Dr Frankenstein will have comments as you do
You can read a newspaper page containing an article about your sentencing judge find a bookcase that can be moved to reveal an opening blocked by a locked grate and if you look hard a dumbwaiter
You can also find on a shelf a glowing green lifestone crystal below which are some of the doctor rsquo s working notes
You will have to leave these items for now mdash ndash but remember where they are
Attached to the wall to the right of the greenboard is a ladder that you may climb to the castle rsquo s upper parapet where you will see a strange looking kite
On the parapet wall is a plaque bearing the Roman numeral II and showing an orbital planetary arrangement that you must carefully note
Nothing to do up here at this time so return down the ladder
When you have finished looking around the Resurrection Laboratory find a trapdoor in the floor below the periodic table chart
Click on this door to go to the room below which is mostly occupied by a very large Tesla coil named after its Serbian inventor the early electrical engineer Nikola Tesla
This device is an electrical transformer that can change both the frequency and magnitude of an alternating electrical voltage it is here erroneously used to store electrical energy from lightning
You can find a knife switch for this device which is in the down position
Leave it that way
Near the foot of the stairs is a door leading out to the castle lower parapet where there is a v shaped break in the parapet wall
Looking down from this break you can see a barred window in which the remnants of the bars have been have been blown outward
Turn around and observe the tower then go to the wall between the two hanging white ropes where you will find three canon balls
Place one of them on the hoist platform on the left then pull on the rope at the right and watch as the hoist lifts the canon ball and tilts it onto a shelf where it rolls until it goes off the other end
Noises of falling objects are heard
With the hoist back down looking to the left there is now on the deck what appears to be moose antlers or perhaps a statue of an eagle in flight in which a rope is entangled
It is not tangled all that much because you can take an end of the rope off to the right and cast it through the notch in the wall
The rope must have become wedged in the notch because it will support you as you climb down and go into the room behind the blown out grate
Once inside turn right and you can make out a ladder
Call this secret passage
Go down the ladder until it changes aspect and color
Turn left and you will see a room in which is a table with a red mess on it it is the remains of a cadaver don rsquo t bother going in as the door that you can see behind the mess is locked
Turn left again to observe two tables and a candle the monster you says that here is a place that he can do some experimenting about which the doctor will be unaware
Return to the ladder and go the bottom
Turn right to be confronted with a crank above which is a set of five different sized gears study the gears so you will know their relative positions
Turn the crank and a panel in the wall on the right begins to move whereupon the top three gears fall
They don rsquo t fall far you can pick them up and put them back easy if you have studied them as suggested
Anyway there are only three gears to remount how hard can it be
With the gears back in place continue turning the crank to complete the panel movement and enlarge the opening then go through it to emerge from behind a tapestry into a large room
You are in the Great Hall of the castle
Go through the double doors at the far end of the Hall and into the banquet room
Turn right and go to the fireplace to pick up the valise
This is an important item because it is where you will carry your inventory
Open the valise to read three pages of Dr Frankenstein's research notes
Turn left and you will hear a door open footsteps and the door closing
Turn left again to see Frankenstein at the far side of the room
Go toward him and he makes some remarks about dead tissue then turns away
Approach him again and he leaves
Turn to face the table then move forward once on its right side face it again and go forward to pick up the turkey leg to use in an experiment
Put the leg in the valise turn around and go through the doors back into the Great Hall
Move to the tapestry at the far end lift it and go into secret passage by the gears
Proceed up the ladder and the rope and stairs all the way to the Resurrection Laboratory
Go to the shelves where you saw the lifestone crystal which you need for the experiment that you are planning but of course Frankenstein will not let you have it so you must devise a way to get it out without him knowing it
He can be seen working at a desk and glancing at you occasionally
At the times when he is concentrating on his work pick up two sets of his notes from the shelf below the crystal and put them in the valise then grasp the crystal and very quickly turn right to the window displaying a red sunset
If Frankenstein apprehends you in any of this activity he will admonish you more severely each time that he catches you and the fourth time he will shoot you thus ending the game unfavorably
However it is not difficult to gather these items unobserved and to put the crystal on the table on front of the sunset window
Then you must acquire the cloth from the bottom shelf at the right and place it on the table next to the crystal
Take four pieces of string from the bundle on the wall and click them on the cloth and you will have formed a parachute for the crystal
Click this on the window and very improbably an updraft carries it to the tower that may be seen in the distance not over the wall as the monster says
You will retrieve the crystal later
If in your hurry you have not yet read the research notes that you just acquired now is a good time to do so
Leave the Resurrection Lab through the trapdoor below the periodic table chart
The cursor will indicate that you can continue down but if you look downward you will see that the steps are broken
Leaning on the steps from the lab above is a dimly perceived board that you may place on the broken part of the steps
Before you take the board look in the wooden box to the right of it for some more research notes
Read these at this time because for some reason you cannot put them in the valise perhaps they are unimportant
Grasp the leaning board and place it on the broken steps then go down to the room on the next level
This is another laboratory called the Frost Room
Here you are facing a locked door a fact that you may determine by clicking on it
Turn left and move forward to find the frost that gives this lab its name though the reason for its existence is not apparent
Click on the frost it is sealing the door behind it shut
The view as you turn left is of equipment on a laboratory bench go to this bench to examine it
The first thing to do is to lift the rightmost of the four knife switches
Loud noises are heard what you have done mdash though you have no way of knowing it mdash is to turn off the machinery that maintains the frost and you must now wait for it to melt
While waiting you can investigate the other items on the bench
Or you can just wait
Pick up the loose wire on the bench and attach it to the open terminal on the bottom of one of the other three switches
The wire appears to still be loose on the bench but you can see a wire on the terminal
Pull down the switch handle to observe what happens
Take the wire from the switch and repeat on another then again on the third
While the foregoing is optional you must take the battery from atop the glowing green one at the end of the bench and also the coils of wire hanging on the wall
Put both of these items in the valise
Turn back to the frost which may or may not have melted and continue turning to see Dr F in front of the locked door that you encountered when you came down the stairs into this room
If he is not there look around while waiting some more and he will show up
He tells you that the door is to your bedroom and that the key is in the drawer of the table
Go right to find the table and get the key in the drawer is a note to read another that won't go into the valise
Carry the key to the bedroom door and click it on the door to unlock it and enter
Look around this small room
In a corner is a wooden cabinet open the cabinet door and discover there is no back to the cabinet
Clearly this is something to investigate but not now
Turn to go back to the Frost Room and Dr F appears in the doorway for some more remarks after which he leaves
Follow him out
By now the frost has melted and you may open the door that it had blocked
In this room a chemical storage room you can find a prybar to put in your valise and two sets of notes as well
There also is another door this one has a handwheel on it but it is locked
Get a closeup of the lock below the handwheel it appears to be a matter of setting five sliders either up or down in the correct combination different possibilities
You have by this time collected everything that you need for your intended experiment except the all important lifestone crystal and you must therefore find a way out of the castle proper and into the courtyard to the tower where you saw the parachute deposit it
The exit door is in the Great Hall
You of course know the most direct route to get to that room back up to the lower parapet down the rope and the secret passage ladder and out past the gears and the tapestry However there may be an alternative the backless cabinet in the bedroom
You have much to learn about this castle in your effort to get away so unless you are in a hurry it is probably a good idea to pursue this latter venue
Going through the cabinet puts you in secret passage
If you turn left upon entering this passage you will be able to look through the back of a picture to see into the bedroom that you just left and through a grate to look at the chemical storage room but they are both empty and you have been in each so there does not seem much point to it
Turning right instead of left takes you immediately to a tee in the passage going right from there you come to an upward leading ladder
Click the upward pointing cursor twice and turn away from the ladder whereupon you will see another grate
Looking through this grate shows the Tesla coil and little else so return to the ladder
Again click the upward pointing cursor twice and turn away from the ladder
Following the revealed passage takes you to a different kind of grate one that you can open
Click on the latch to do this and you see the back of a bookcase click on that and it slides to the right
You are looking into the Resurrection Laboratory from the grated opening that you discovered earlier behind the bookcase that could be moved aside
Move forward once for a better view
You can see many of the items that you looked at after you became conscious on the central table with Dr Frankenstein leaning over you but more importantly you get a new perspective on the table itself it is situated in a depressed circular section of the floor on a platform suspended by chains from four pillars and it appears as though the this platform may be raised and lowered
You just may have noticed these pillars and chains when you first became conscious staring up at the ceiling of this laboratory
You could move into the Laboratory but you have already examined it and are not likely to find anything new so return to the ladder however if you do go into it you will find the grate no longer locked and you may return to the secret passage
Whatever go to the ladder then go all the way down to the area where you first entered this secret passage
Leaving the ladder follow the passage straight through the tee and after a couple turns you will come upon another grate from which you can see a room that is unfamiliar but is full of laboratory equipment
Follow the passage to another tee and after turning right here you will eventually come to a plaque affixed to the left wall
There are two more of these plaques but as it turns out they have no bearing on the progress or solution of the game
Their purpose will remain a mystery
After the plaque you will find one more grate again looking at an unfamiliar room this one containing a telescope
Not surprisingly Dr Frankenstein appears to have an observatory
Passing the grate you encounter a dead end so go back to the tee and through it to find a ladder going down
Climb down this ladder to secret passage
Turn away from the ladder and move forward once mdash you are at a tee in this new passage
Turning right and following this branch for a bit you find yourself at the rear of a fireplace in which a fire is burning brightly
Clearly you cannot proceed further so go back to the tee and move to the right
You will encounter a scaffolding barrier blocking the passage but very fortunately you are carrying a tool to take care of that
Get the prybar from the valise and click it on five of the barrier nails and the boards will fall away
Put the prybar back in the valise and move onward and after several turns you will come upon another of the mystery plaques displaying a line diagram
Immediately following there is second scaffolding barrier for you to treat as you did the first one
After three more turns the passage takes you to yet another ladder to go down to secret passage
Following this passage away from the ladder after many turns mdash six in fact mdash your way is blocked by a jet of steam from a pipe each time you try to pass it
Looks as though there will be a long trip back
During this return you will find a third line diagram plaque
However just before you get to the ladder going back up to secret passage there is on the left wall a lever which when pulled down moves back some bricks in the wall and when you crawl through you find yourself in the Great Hall which is where you want to be so you can go for the lifestone crystal
Turning around and moving the wall torch also opens the bricks
Go through the double doors opposite the Great Hall stairs and you will be in the courtyard where on the far side is the castle gate and the tower where the lifestone crystal landed
Move to the edge of the brick paved area and look outward
On the left is a hedge maze and on the right is a topiary garden with a long narrow pool separating them
Turn left and move along to the tower
On the way you will see a rope lying on the bricks under a tree but you can rsquo t make use of it now
Later undoubtedly
At the tower look upward to see the crystal glowing up there
Click the upward cursor on the tower to produce an upward view of the tower showing a couple stones protruding from the wall
Climb the tower by clicking on the stones that produce the upward cursor when you get to the screen showing two of these keep to the left
When you can reach the crystal without the parachute put it in the valise which you have kept with you during this somewhat precarious ascent
Climb back down by clicking on the stones showing a downward cursor
You have what you need for your experiment but before you return to the hidden room in secret passage go to the castle gate and turn right to look at the long pool between the two foliage sections
In the end wall of the pool is to be found another of the planetary position plaques No
III
Now note the slight difference in forward cursors for going along either side of the pool and there is yet another move forward once on the left side then move the cursor slowly to the right so that it is above the pool mdash this is not the previous right poolside cursor
Click it and a statue of a goblin on a sphere is shown in the pool click on the sphere and the statue lowers in the water
Move forward and a door to a tunnel opens in the wall ahead
Go through the door
Move ahead through the tunnel soon coming to a dock that is just inside the mouth of a cave looking out at a large body of water
Advance to the edge of the dock and turn left avoiding the down cursor
On the dock is a battery with a loose wire and on a table directly in front of you is a brown spherical object that is a diving helmet
Click on the helmet to don it and be sure to take the spear gun that is yet on the table
Connect the wire to the battery to start the noisy air compressor then turn right and use the down cursor on the ladder at the left to enter the water
Turn right to see a piece of paper on which are twelve names right again to be attacked by an octopus that is automatically dispatched by the spear gun
Right once more to find a box filled with gold bars that may be seen but not taken
Turn left and go up the ladder to the dock where you will be facing the exit tunnel
Click on the tunnel to remove the helmet and approach six logs forming a bridge that you may cross to enter the tunnel
Move forward taking the tunnel on the left back out to the long pool opening the gate with the lever on the right wall of the tunnel
You still have your experiment to do so go the length of the pool turn left and go past the tower back to the castle
On the way back examine the rope under the tree clicking on it causes one end to rise like a cobra then fall back
Curious
In the dirt at the base of the tree is another planetary plaque No
IV
When you get to the secret room in secret passage the paraphernalia collected for the experiment of infusing life into the turkey leg appears spontaneously on the table with the candle this must include the illustrative sheet of Frankenstein's notes that you acquired at the time you took the crystal
Connect the wires from the battery to the ends of the lifestone crystal which shortly begins to glow then goes dark
Very despondent soliloquy from the monster who believes the experiment failed the turkey leg disappears as he takes it to satisfy his hunger and the screen goes dark
Sounds of vomiting and when the screen lights up again bits of regurgitated food are on the table
Pieces of chewed turkey leg move away indicating that the experiment worked after all
What this peculiar incident is probably supposed to illustrate is how to use a lifestone crystal to irradiate dead tissue so that it is again alive
From a new perspective after the vomiting there appears at the foot of a table a previously unseen grappling hook for you put it in the valise
From previous remarks made by the monster a good bet is that it could be used with the rope under the courtyard tree so return to that location
However it would seem that Frankenstein has discovered that some of his research notes are missing and when you leave the Great Hall for the courtyard he appears in the doorway threatening and demanding the return of his notes
Curiously he makes no mention of the lifestone crystal
He goes into the castle and you follow him in for more threats after which he leaves
Go back out to the courtyard and to the rope lying beneath the tree
Click the grappling hook on the rope whence it becomes affixed to the rope end then click on the hook and it rises to attach itself to the tree limb outside the open castle window
Climb the rope and go through the window
You are in the castle Trophy Room as attested by the several mounted game animal heads
Ahead is a door if you try to use it to exit the room the suits of armor on each side of it become animated and bar your way with their axes
Even though Frankenstein is elsewhere in the castle you can hear him continually demanding his notes and making dire threats
Turn left and you can see another note on a table against the wall under some trophies
This one is a rather incriminating one written by your sentencing judge but does not go into the valise
Turn left twice to see the fire that you came upon when exploring secret passage
Since it bars the way to a secret passage perhaps you should out it out
To the right is a glass tank of water on wheels use your cursor to locate and remove the piece of firewood blocking one of the wheels then click on the tank to move it under the chandelier
Move close to the fireplace and click on the reel of rope supporting the chandelier
The rope will unwind dropping the chandelier and breaking the glass tank
The resulting flood of water will extinguish the fire
You can now go through the fireplace but you have already explored that secret passage
Go back to the door and place the black table against it
Now when you try to go through the axes become embedded in the table and you can exit to the second floor hallway
Move forward and go around the corner to the left
The hall extends quite a way ahead move that way four times and you will find an unlocked door on the right
The room inside this door has suffered damage mostly from fire
The only thing of note here is another planetary plaque No
I
Leave the room and continue on down the hall
When you come to the end go right forward left and forward
You need not proceed further as all the doors ahead are locked
The door on your left however is not locked
Go through this door and up the stairs to the third floor hallway
All the doors in this short hall are locked except the one you just came through and the one in the alcove around the corner to the right
When you enter this room immediately in front of you on a table are two more notes
Looking around this room with its globe astrolabe and books you can conclude that it is Frankenstein's study
Turn to the right go to the bookshelf turn left and you can see his telescope so the observatory is attached to the study
Looking through the telescope shows nothing that you can recognize nor is anything to be found in the many books so return down the stairs to the second floor hallway and back toward the Trophy Room
Just before you get to the end of the hall before you turn to the Trophy Room you will find an alcove on the left with an unlocked door at the end when you go through this door and glance around you will realize that you have entered the castle library
Click on the double eagle heraldic shield on the left to get the axe from behind it then use the axe to draw the rolling library ladder to you
Go down the ladder to the library floor
The first thing you see are two sets of notes for you to read and put in the valise
Look around the room for two more sets
In the course of this search you will doubtless find a trapdoor but it is locked
One other thing that you must find mdash and it is not all that easy mdash is a set of small green scales or balances on the end of a lower shelf
On one pan is a skull shaped weight move it to the other pan and you will open the hidden door to the other end of secret passage
Following this passage you will arrive at the steam pipe that puts out a jet of steam as you attempt to pass it but here you can reach the valve that shuts off the steam
Do that and continue past the steam valve until you get to the lever that will open the hole in the wall and let you into the Great Hall
Frankenstein is here waiting for you frustrated and very angry indeed
He tells you that he has waited long enough for the return of his notes and he is going to kill you permanently if you do not do exactly as he orders
He has a gun and will use it if you don rsquo t do as he says try it and see if you wish
He then begins a series of step by step peremptory orders that take you back to the library and down through the now somehow open trapdoor to the dungeon where you are shackled to a wall
A shadow shows you being whipped after which Frankenstein leaves
Curiously in the valise you still have the notes he wants
Look at your woman rsquo s left arm in its shackle
This arm is small enough so that it can slip the shackle when you click on it
Click on the right shackle that hand is too big to slip out
Turn back to the left shackle a key is mysteriously lowered on a string
Take the key and with an unshackled left hand you can use it to unlock the right shackle
You are free
The trapdoor dungeon entrance from the library at the head of the stairs to the right of the skeleton is locked
However to the right there is a grate in the wall that may be opened behind which is a tunnel leading to a chamber that has two tunnels as exits
Of these the right tunnel takes you to secret passage in the castle adjacent to the ladder going up and the lever that opens the wall passage to the Great Hall however when in the secret passage there is no evidence of this tunnel and you cannot get back into it
From the chamber the other tunnel going straight ahead takes you to yet a different chamber again with two tunnel exits
The right one takes you to a gray ladder and up to the topiary garden and the left one to a brown ladder and up to the hedge maze
As it happens you have to get to the maze so that is the way to go if you take either of the other two tunnels you would still have to find your way to the maze
In guiding you about the maze the following simple shorthand will be used F forward one click L turn left R turn right D down
When you climb the ladder up to the maze for some reason you are one click back from the hole where you emerged
From this position move LFRFLF to a skull
When the scurrying beetle stops momentarily capture it put it in the valise and back away
Go LFRFRFRFFLFRFFFLFRFLFLFLFLF to a pair of plants
Put the beetle in the smaller plant so that you may retrieve the shears from the larger one
Back away and go LFRFRFRFFLFF LFRFRFRFRD to vine covered wooden doors
Use the shears to cut the vines whereupon the doors spring open to reveal a passage downward
Go down
You end up at the bottom of a ladder to the right of which is a lever arrangement similar to the one in secret passage that opens the wall access to the Great Hall
Well pull it that rsquo s what levers are for
Rumblings are heard
You may well wonder what has happened and you can check it out go back up the ladder move forward toward the dimly seen castle and climb the ladder to the paved area of the courtyard
Turn around and move to the edge of the paved area you will see that a corner of the maze has been rearranged so you will not have traverse the entire maze again should you have to go through it
Retrace your steps back down the ladder and to the just pulled maze configuration control lever
Go through the tunnel next to the lever and up the ladder
Still underground you are in the planetary control chamber with the control unit affixed to the wall
Take a moment to look around and you will see four heavily barred gates identified by Roman numerals
Get a closeup of the control unit noting the lever on the right
Clicking on the handwheel causes it to rotate as do the planets at different orbital speeds in the planetarium on the left
Click on the handwheel again to stop the rotation
Below the handwheel are eight covers that may be slid back two at a time one in the top row that displays symbols and one in the bottom row that displays Roman numerals
It may be observed at this point that for centuries the ancient alchemists believed that there were but four elements fire water air and earth
Behind the upper row of covers on the control unit the stylized symbols are icons of flames waves wind and mountains the four element equivalencies are apparent mountains being of earth
Now consider the four planetary plaques and where you found them plaque I in the fire damaged room corresponding element fire plaque II on the upper parapet with the kites and the wind blowing corresponding element air plaque III on the end of the long pool corresponding element water plaque IV in the dirt at the base of a courtyard tree corresponding element earth
What you must do is regard each plaque in turn and bring the three control unit settings in agreement open the lower cover to the Roman numeral on the plaque the upper cover to the corresponding symbol as indicated above and using the handwheel set the positions of the planets as shown on the plaque
Pull the lever on the side of the control unit and if you have set all correctly you will hear the sound of the matching gate opening
It would be convenient to go ahead and open all the gates but only one gate at a time may be open
You need not open the gates in numerical order in fact you should open gate IV to the mausoleum at this point because there you will find many notes containing information and directions that will be needed elsewhere
Of the eight covers on the planetary control panel open the one on the bottom right to show the Roman numeral IV and the one above it to display the corresponding icon for earth then manipulate the handwheel until the planets are in the arrangement that you carefully noted when you found the plaque in the dirt at the base of the tree in the courtyard
When you think you have duplicated the arrangement pull the lever on the right of the control unit if you are indeed correct you will hear sounds of movement that of gate IV rolling back
Proceed through the now open gate IV to the mausoleum and click on the open drawer in the bank on the right for a closeup
Click on the skull to open the jaw
Run the cursor over the books and a spider will emerge scurry about hesitate and run into the skull
Click on the skull again to close the jaw
With the spider trapped you can withdraw eighteen note pages from between the books most of which go into the valise
One of these shows a sketch of the handwheel and lock on the door in the castle chemical storage room with the unlocking slider positions indicated
As you read all the notes the plot thickens
Return to the planetary control unit and open gate I
Slide back the appropriate control panel covers and set the planetarium configuration to that of plaque I and click on the lever to hear gate IV close and gate I open
After you enter this gate you may wish to do some exploring
To the left just after entering is a tunnel at the end of which you will find a stone framed opening with red and black pushbuttons on the left and looking closely inside the plates of a conveyor belt may be seen
The buttons have no effect at the moment but you will have to come back here soon
Back off and turn left to see a wall other than dirt a cool breeze is detected
Go back toward the entrance and continue on into the tunnel where you will soon come upon a chamber showing three openings
Here on the shadowy floor is something that you might at first take for a sea creature but in fact appears to be a disembodied hand that can move and speak but cannot be understood
It slowly crawls away through the right opening of the three
The left opening leads to another locked door and through the center opening is a conveyor belt identical to the first
Follow the hand through the right opening and note that immediately after you do you can hear running water
Move forward twice more and you will be in another three doored chamber identical to the first except that there is a rock in this one
Here is the hand again click on it and it crawls away through the left opening
Once more there is a conveyor belt behind the center opening the right opening brings you to a blank wall
Turn around and go back through the tunnel to the spot where you heard the running water
Turn left here and follow the tunnel to a slowly turning water wheel you should have one of the doctor rsquo s notes in the valise about this being the source of power of his mining operations
Behind the wheel is a large door chained shut
In the foreground is a horizontal pipe in which is a handwheel controlled valve
Click on the handwheel to turn off the flow of water and the wheel stops turning
You can now go across the wheel to the door
Look down to the chain on the floor click on it and an end rises and hangs in the air then you are holding a few links
Carry the links to the water wheel where the chain becomes attached then cross the wheel to the pipe and click on the handwheel to restart the water flow
The turning wheel noisily pulls away the door providing access to a tunnel behind it and after a bit the waterwheel continues turning as before
Cross over on the fallen door to the large switch on the wall next to the now open tunnel and pull the switch handle down
You will hear an industrial noise as power is applied to the tunnel complex
With power now available return to the three conveyor belts that you saw in the tunnels and use the black buttons on each to start them up whereupon you will see rocks moving by mdash ndash the same rocks in all three passing again and again
Go back to the waterwheel proceed across the fallen door and through the tunnel behind it to the end then turn left and follow the rails to a metal gate
Raise the gate using the lever on the right and you will see a ladder and a cart on the rails below a hopper
Go up the ladder and move ahead to the pulverizer which is the end of Frankenstein's pitchblende mining operation that he described in one of his notes
Pitchblende is an ore containing a large percentage of uranium oxide
Go a step farther and to the right of the tripod at the rear of the cavern you can see one more conveyor belt just like the previous three energize it with the black button and again the same rocks flow past
Step back from this noisy unit turn right and move to the white box on a post which turns out to be the pulverizer master switch
Press the black button and heavy duty motors may be heard to start up
When that noise dies away the pointing cursor will indicate a unit to the right click on it and you will be at the pulverizer controls
In the valise notes you should find a nasty letter from Frankenstein to Mario the pulverizer operator with some instructions on its operation unfortunately not detailed ones
Pull the knife switch toward you and the pulverizer conveyor is set in motion transporting large chunks of ore under the two hammers the left one operated by the red button and the right one by the black button
Every ore chunk must be struck by both hammers in order to pulverize it enough should you somehow miss and a piece too large gets past the machine shuts down and you must clear it by going to and pulling the lever that is located off to the right mdash ndash mentioned by Frankenstein to Mario mdash ndash then begin again by going to the master switch resetting it by pushing the red button then restart by pushing the black one
Go to the control and continue crushing and when you succeed in getting enough crushed ore for a full cart load the conveyor stops and you will hear the ore slide into the cart
Go down the ladder and check the cart if it is filled you can see ore above the cart end
Go back along the tracks a couple clicks to the tunnel entrance from the waterwheel on the right
Travel through this tunnel past the waterwheel and the rest of the tunnels to the planetary control panel where you must open gate III on order to get into the refinery
At the planetary control panel to open gate III use a similar procedure that you used to open gates I and IV sliding back the control panel covers to show the Roman numeral III and the icon for water and setting the planetarium to the pattern of plaque III
With the gate open move to stand in the entrance
You now have to navigate the relatively simple maze of the wine cellar go FFFFFRFLFRFLFRFL and pass through the square opening in the masonry wall
You are now in Frankenstein's ore refinery and to your left is a closed metal door blocking the ore cart entry
Click on the lever on the right to open the gate and move through to face a tunnel wall
Turn left and proceed along the tracks unit you get to a track switch lever on the left just before the end of the track
Pull the lever to shift the track so that it leads into the barely discernable tunnel on the left
Should you travel down this tunnel you will find a ladder going up to a firmly closed trapdoor from which a chain is hanging
Pulling on the chain does not budge the trapdoor
Return back up the track and you will shortly see on the right side of the track a desk like stand with another track switch lever next to it
Click on this stand and you will be placed behind it it is a control for moving the ore cart
The cart is self propelled and somehow gets its movement signals from the two knife switches on the stand
Pull the left knife switch down whereupon the ore cart comes from the right where you have filled it with crushed ore in the pulverizer and disappears into the distance down the track
Follow it and you will find resting below the trapdoor
Click on the hanging chain to fasten it to the cart
Go back to the cart control stand and set the switches both down to bring the cart rolling back and disappearing to the right
Now pull on the lever at the stand rsquo s left and see the tracks turn to lead left into the refinery then pull the left knife switch down whereupon the ore cart comes from the right and disappears into the refinery
Follow it in
You may wish to briefly look around
In one corner there is a high voltage coil on the base of which is a knife switch that must be placed in the up position before you leave but not right now
Down is for the refinery up is for the Crystallizer
The most prominent item is a large barrel shaped unit that in the letter to its supplier Frankenstein calls a blast furnace
Unseen above is a mechanical arm called a claw From a position behind the cart you will see two stairs
Go up the one on the right and in the room at the top turn to the table where from the right hand drawer you can get several important notes that include diagrams delineating the controls for the refining process and for the soon to be used Crystallizer
It would be a good idea to have copies of these notes and diagrams so that you will not have to keep retrieving them from the trunk
Leave this room and go up the other set of steps then turn and get a closeup of the refinery control panel
The refining process on the refinery floor is viewed through a protective screen to the right of the panel and is straightforward place the pitchblende ore in the temperature controlled furnace apply a short period of electricity and remove the refined ore You may wish to consult the above suggested control panel copy as you go through the following steps
Note There are couple discrepancies between the sketch and the panel itself but these are of little consequence
Pull the vertical claw control knob down
The claw enters the furnace
Move the vertical claw control knob up
The claw retrieves the glowing refined pitchblende from the furnace
Move the horizontal claw control knob from right to left
The arm moves the pitchblende over the cart
Pull the vertical claw control knob down
The pitchblende is placed in the cart
Move the vertical claw control up
The arm moves up out of the way
Leave the control room and exit the refinery to the cart control stand being sure that before you do you have thrown the switch on the high voltage coil to the up position
At the cart control set the switches to bring the cart rolling out of the refinery and to the right toward the pulverizer
Click on the track switch lever to change the track direction away from the refinery
Now set the switches to send the cart down the track past the refinery follow it down to find the trapdoor on the ground and the cart parked below the trapdoor opening
Climb the ladder into the Crystallizer lab
The equipment in this laboratory can be confusing until you sort it out
Some of it has been mentioned in Frankenstein's notes and you have the control diagram that you found along with the refinery control diagram
Around you as you emerge from the trapdoor are racks of equipment that have no function other than to locate this entrance
In front of you is the Crystallizer unit and behind it is the mixer over which are spherical tanks of water and nitric acid HNO
In the left rear can be seen the equipment control unit with cables running to it on the floor and on the right a door that opens to the Great Hall
Another mechanical arm and claw is attached to the ceiling and out of sight in the wall to the left is the Resurrection Laboratory dumbwaiter
Your task is to use the refined pitchblende to make a lifestone crystal though what is wrong with the one that you already used is not stated
Perhaps they may only be used once
Move from the trapdoor entrance to the control panel
A knob at upper right in the sketch the claw control has T shaped movement slots
Move it to the right and the refined pitchblende is retrieved from the cart below the trapdoor by the mechanical arm
Move the knob to the left and the arm places the pitchblende in the mixer then returns to its rest position
Maneuver your way around the equipment so that you are looking directly at the mixer with the two labeled spherical tanks at either side
The best way to do this to return from the control panel to trapdoor look for the equipment racks then go past the right side of the Crystallizer
There is a valve at the base of the water tank where the hose joins it
Click on this valve and a measured amount of water flows into the mixing vat
Do the same with the HNO acid tank to add acid
Lift the knife switch on the vat support leg directly in front of you
The mixer blades descend stir the mixture then rise out of it
Click on the drain valve at the bottom of the mixing vat
Mixture flows into the adjacent tall container
Return to the control panel via the trapdoor
One of Frankenstein's notes says to use volts to crystallize lifestone
The digital voltmeter registers volts
Use the voltage control knob below it to raise it to
Move the claw control knob to the left
The arm and claw picks up the mixture filled container and returns to its rest position
Pull down the larger black knob
The arm puts the container upright in the Crystallizer and pulls away
Throw the knife switch in the upper left corner from left to right
The arm swings so the claw is above the Crystallizer
Brief loud buzzing ensues
To the right of the control panel is a lever that resembles those used to switch the cart track
Move this lever forward
The Crystallizer rotates and electrical discharges move from the claw to the Crystallizer
Several items turn green
When the rotation stops return knife switch to the left
The claw retreats
Move the claw control knob in the T slot downward
The arm and claw pick up the finished lifestone crystal and carries it off to the dumbwaiter
Go to the dumbwaiter where you will find the glowing crystal inside
Click on the red button to send the dumbwaiter up then leave the lab by the door to the Great Hall
There are still areas of the castle that you have not yet explored
Recall that in the mausoleum you found the combination for the locked door in the chemical storage room so go there
Click on the tapestry covering the access to secret passage go up the ladder and then the rope to the lower parapet through the Tesla coil room to the frost room below and into the chemical storage room
The sliders below the handwheel are difficult to see but upon close scrutiny they can be set to the positions shown in the mausoleum note
Success will be demonstrated when the handwheel turns as you click on it and the door opens for you to enter
You have seen this room before through one of the secret passage grates
There is a somewhat gruesome optional exercise at this point if you wish to undertake it otherwise skip this paragraph
Go to the table on the right to read more of Frankenstein's notes then return to the shelves to the right of the entry door
On one of the shelves are four pink objects in jars these are human brains Pick up one carry it to the apparatus on the right and place it in the pan above the knife switch
Click on the bird like probe which will move to a spot on the brain then close the knife switch to hear a few last words
The probe withdraws click on it again for more words
Keep clicking on the probe until the words are repeated
Put the brain back in its jar
You may do this for the other three brains as well
Toward the end of the room opposite the entrance there is another door in the wall on the left
Open this door to find Frankenstein facing you from behind some cages
Animal noises are heard
Approach him for an interchange of invective after which he goes behind some boxes
Find a desk on which there is another set of notes about a modification of the Resurrection Laboratory equipment
Keep moving around possibly seeing animals in cages until Frankenstein appears calls you an incompetent drunk and raised his gun to shoot you
Quickly turn right to a door which after a self demeaning soliloquy on your part will open to the rdfloor hallway
You have been in this hall before when you examined Frankenstein's study and you know there is no way out but the door to the left which leads to the ndfloor hallway where the closest exit is to the top of one of the Great Hall stairs
Where to hide
Well there are numerous places to go
One of them is into the tunnels at the end of the long pool
Go out into the courtyard and head for the tower
Past the tower is a strangely dressed man with a pronounced accent and a handgun who clearly intends to kill you quickly turn toward the pool where you find another man this one with a rifle but with the same dire intention on your life
Rapidly turn right again and hurry back to the castle and the Great Hall
Just before the Great Hall door is the second man who has beat you there carrying his rifle and grim intentions with him but again if you act quickly you can get into the Hall where you are temporarily safe
Go up the right stairs
When you get through the door turn left move forward to the end of the hallway turn right forward and left again and head for the door at the end of the hall
This door has been locked up to now but fortunately is no longer so though it locks again after you go through it
You have time to look around and see that this is a bedroom even while one of the men is pounding on the door and shouting threats
You must find and click on a full length mirror behind which are shadowy movements
The mirror breaks and in the opening is a young woman who urgently tells you to follow her
As you do so going after her as quickly as the cursor allows you pass through tunnels that should be familiar to you from your experiences behind planetary gate I
She tells you her name is Sara Strauss
Eventually you enter some new tunnels ending up at the mouth of a cave looking out at a sunset
Turn to Sara on the right next to some barrels on one of which is a cup and a tree branch
Click on the barrels She says that she knows who you are offers you the cup for a drink and moves off
Strangely in this cave there are shelves with some bottles on the top one
If you are indeed thirsty click on the cup for a drink then put it back
You can use the tree limb to knock down a bottle which will break upon falling unless you first click on the adjacent barrel to push it behind the shelves so the bottle lands safely in it
At this point the order of things tend to become slightly confusing
Keep switching right or left when the action becomes static
Sara speaks several times as do you the monster
The disembodied hand shows up in the foliage frightening Sara
You have the option of throwing a rock at it or not in either case it withdraws though you may have to wait a bit for it to do so
Whether or not you use the convenient rock determines whether Sara survives or is shot
Sara wants to get Frankenstein's help but you want to take her to the mausoleum to show her that he is evil
After this intention is stated leave this place and travel through the tunnels FFFFRFFRFR to the planetary control unit
Sara questions you a couple times as you go indicating she is with you
Just before you get to the tunnel entrance you hear gate I conveniently open
Use the control unit to open gate IV and take Sara into the mausoleum
When you get there pull out the three remaining documents from the open drawer however your intention of demonstrating evil seems to have backfired as Sara expresses admiration for Frankenstein then leaves stating that she must find him
As you start to follow her out an earthquake hits
Rocks fall but the tunnel is not blocked though the ones behind gates I and III are and the control unit has fallen blocking the exit tunnel
However Gate II has been shaken open and when you go to it you find that the rocks formerly blocking it have shifted enough so that you can get by
That is where Sara has gone so go FFRFF to her then immediately go up the ladder as she indicates and keep moving up as fast as the cursor will let you
Three times you will have a choice of ladders the first time take the left one the second time the right one and the third time the left one
At the top click on Sara when she reaches for you and you will end up in the topiary garden
Sara leaves to look for Frankenstein she says
Move forward and leave the garden through the spiderweb gate
Outside turn left and place the cursor over the pool so that when you go forward you see the gargoyle and sphere statuary
Click on the latter to move it downward then go forward to the castle end of the pool to have the gate slide down
Again follow the tunnel to the dock of your previous underwater excursion
Without going to the edge of the dock look around and discover a bomb and under a bottle on a crate an incriminating note from Judge Rothenbush to Vladimir
Take the note
Somehow Sara is here and it is decided not to touch the bomb and to find Frankenstein
Frankenstein could be in many places in his large castle but as it happens he is in his observatory
Leave the dock across the six logs to the exit take the left tunnel and use the lever on the right wall to open the door to the long pool
Go to the Great Hall up the stairs to the second floor hallway up the stairs behind the door near the bedroom to the third floor right and around the corner into the alcove in which is the door to the study
In the study turn right and Sara who must have been with you all the way goes into the observatory
Follow her in to see Frankenstein gazing out a window
There follows a long emotional conversation between the two of them in which Frankenstein states he knows of the collusion between the judge and Vladimir and that he put the bomb there to get rid of them
He denies that there are any children involved despite the note thrown at his feet which he ignores
You hear his footsteps leaving
Go into the study where he is standing in the doorway
He speaks placatingly that he is going to defuse the bomb then closes the door and locks it shouting from the outside that the bomb will go off as planned and the two of you must stay in these rooms
Return to the observatory and Sara who is now disillusioned
She is looking out a window and sees children being taken into the dock
Look through the telescope and see this and recognize Gabrielle whom you are supposed to have killed and for which deed you have been convicted by Judge Rothenbush and hung
You must get out and try to do something
Back in the study there is a grate high in a wall you have used grates before to make an escape
This one is too high to reach but if you move the table on the left click on it underneath you can reach it
The grate is locked
Look in the drawer of the table next to the one you just moved to get the key but when you try to use it you drop it
Move the table again to discover the key in a floor grate where it is just beyond your reach
On a table in the observatory next to Sara is a magnet that you can use to retrieve the key and this time you are able to unlock the grate but the opening is too small for you to crawl through
However Sara can and when she gets into the hall she unlocks and opens the door
There is a gunshot
Frankenstein has rigged a deadfall so that opening the door sets it off
Back in the cave when the disembodied hand appeared in the foliage and frightened Sara you has the opportunity to chase it off by throwing a rock at it had you done so the deadfall will kill Sara but if you had waited for the hand to withdraw on its own then the hand would have taken the shot and Sara is spared
You must get to the dock
As you open the door to go down the stairs to the second floor an explosion is heard Frankenstein has set off the bomb
By now you know the way when you click on the gargoyle and open the door at the end of the long pool smoke escapes
Hurry to the dock but you are too late Gabrielle is dead
But you have made a lifestone crystal you can bring her back to life
Pick up Gabrielle and carry her to the Great Hall up the ladder in secret passage up the rope to the lower parapet and up to the Resurrection Laboratory
When you enter the Laboratory you will be facing the skeleton and a thunderstorm has come up
Turn right and Gabrielle will be on the table on which you yourself came back to life
Now you must get the crystal from the dumbwaiter where it was placed after you made it
Turn left forward to the right twice and left
Click on the dumbwaiter grating to move it aside then on the dumbwaiter to see the glowing crystal
Pick it up and move back
Turn right twice and place the crystal vertically in the holder at the end of the green arm above Gabrielle
Turn left go forward to the right then right and you will be at the control panel
Click on the three switches on left side of the panel and they all flip to the right
Click on the two switches on the right side of the panel and they both flip up
Click on the cart track type lever on the left of the panel and the platform carrying Gabrielle rises out of sight
The electricity in the storm must be used to energize the Tesla coil and that in turn applied to the lifestone crystal
Values and timing are critical
Details are given in the notes that you have been collecting
Turn left from the control panel and move to the periodic table chart then go down through trapdoor to room below where the Tesla coil is located
Move forward and left to the knife switch which you must throw to the up position
Go back up to the Resurrection Laboratory and continue up the ladder to the upper parapet
Click on the anemometer to bring up the wind speed gauge
When the indicator is between and or close back off and click on the reel of kite cord to release the kite which will sail out into the lightning
Go down the ladder and through the trapdoor to the Tesla coil switch
Pull the switch down and watch the meter be patient when the needle approaches the red area push the switch back up
Return up to the Resurrection Laboratory
Move forward to the right three times then right and you will be at the control panel
Click on the three switches on the board left to set them back to the left to complete the life giving process
Watch the concluding video
An epilog follows concerning the principle characters
Commentary Thinking back on the game after finishing it a few thoughts and opinions came to me as I wonder if I have missed anything After the monster acquires the inventory valise it accompanies him wherever he goes even during the precarious ascent of the tower
This inventory always accompanying a protagonist everywhere is an Adventure game phenomenon that one learns to accept
The only part of the monster one gets to see are brief glimpses of his arms
I for one would like to observe what Frankenstein put together
Apparently it did not faze his daughter
Why are those three mysterious line plaques found in the secret passages included
I would like to know what it was that the disembodied hand says
After the first visit to the dock one may well wonder about its purpose
The gold bars are never touched the list of children is gratuitous as is the appearance of the octopus mdash though you will get killed if you do not pick up the speargun before entering the water
You don rsquo t have to put out the fire in the Trophy Room mdash ndash at least as far as the appended walkthrough goes
A different one might enter the secret passage that way
Somewhat along the same line you may realize that other than for initial exploration the walkthrough does not take you back to several of the secret passages and if you do you could get to your destinations by another route
However game replay with this in mind resulted in sequences not appearing when required for game progress
Frankenstein makes quite a point of wanting his notes back but he does not take them when he has Phillip shackled in the dungeon
The only access to the Resurrection Laboratory at the top of the castle that is shown in the game is via secret passage and the rope to the lower parapet
It is inconceivable that Dr Frankenstein used this route yet no other is ever indicated
One would hardly expect him to ride the dumbwaiter
Having the alternative of setting the game to have Sara live or die seems rather pointless
The monster must have been recreated with extraordinary strength and agility in order to carry Gabrielle from the dock to the Resurrection Laboratory including up the rope to the parapet
A unit such as the Tesla coil will not store energy more than a few milliseconds at most
A capacitor will
It is my opinion that this game has an unsatisfactory ending something that I find is characteristic of many Adventure games
