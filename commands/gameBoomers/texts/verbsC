He'll tell you about the satellite sending anti testosterone pulses towards Earth and hands over his keys to his shuttle sort of
Noah will accompany you
Squish
Aim to get rid of that satelliteOutside with keys and use them to call shuttle
Step on platform for a ride up to the craft
Look around and pick up sushi tray from trash to get palm leaf
Open cabinet to get gloves and locker to get EVA suit and helmet
Search suit to get putty tube and contact lenses
Grab the tree airfreshner from above control panel
Now for the controls
As Squish said they're idiot proof so you can just fiddle around till you take off and navigate to the satellite but if your patience fails here's the way
There's a panel of six buttons to the left of the display and one of five buttons above the display these are the important ones
On the group of six press the first button it's the only red one to take off
This will light up the second button which is for landing
Next go to the group of five buttons and press the red 'u' until the satellite image appears in the display
This will light up the third button on the other panel that looks like an up arrow
Press this one umpteen times to increase speed until the asterisk button next to the 'u' turns red
Press this one for your trip to the satellite
Now on the first panel press the fourth button to unlock the hatch turn around and open it
Exit and try to walk forward there's a decontamination barrier that gives you grief
You need to 'cover up' so wear EVA suit gloves and helmet
Try again
Still can't cross your suit has four arms so another pair of gloves is essential
Back to shuttle and find the 'somethingorother' which is a replicator
Pop in the gloves and get a second pair and wear them
Now you can cross in comfort
Remove all and place them on conveyor belt press button below light to send them back to Noah
He will return them to you
Open hatch and enter
Turn around and push off from the left bumper to float to next hatch the one with three circles it's the only one unlocked at this time
A robot appears and you must convince it that you are Squish like
So apply putty on yourself wear EVA suit two pairs of gloves airfreshner and palm leaf put on lenses last
Press key ring or talk to robot to find out you're not Squish ish enough
Talk to Noah and tell him to stand behind and operate the spare arms
Press key ring again
The robot will let you pass and move off to carry out an urgent repair
Enter control room
The panel to your right allows you to unlock the other doors so examine it and locate the room you are in
It should have a red outline and a gap on the circumference denoting an open door click on it to shut the door and it will then show a single thin blue line
To unlock the other doors all the other displays should look the same
Just to the left of this display are three buttons
Press the bottom red button with a circle so the other rooms are outlined in red
Now click on each of these in turn to unlock the doors
If you investigate the other rooms now you will learn that one has a forcefield and the other has some storage compartments which you can't reach because the robot is repairing the ladder
Back to the control room and look at satellite controls middle panel
Press top button to stop satellite spinning turns off gravity so you have no need of the ladder and bottom button to turn off forcefield
You can now enter the circuitry room but Noah needs to be anchored so he can work
You need some special equipment
Move on to store room and now you can float to the compartments
Open them to get boots gun and tool
Back to circuitry room and Noah will take the boots
Give him the tool and he will get to work disabling the anti testosterone emitter
He may be some time For fun if you push off from the lower button outside the door you can visit other rooms that take you into scenes from previous Legend Games
Return to control room and look at room controls
You must open the door to the storeroom where the robot is working this seems to be just to move time on
Click the top red button so that only the room you are in is outlined in red
Now click on that room so that all the rooms are outlined in red then click on the storeroom with 't' symbol to open it
Return to Noah where the robot has spotted him through the open door and is annoying him
You must distract the robot and shooting it doesn't work
Shoot the bulkhead instead so the robot will move to repair it
You will now be whisked back to the communication panel in the control room where you learn the mothership has been alerted
Try to communicate but don't know if this is important
Back to shuttle and watch Noah's transformation before he joins you
Shuttle controls again press button to lock the hatch you'll find it set destination to Callahan's increase speed until the asterisk button turns red
Try to leave but you can't break away from the tractor beam
Switch on shields still not enough
You need to press up arrow to increase speed to maximum TTT
Press asterisk having completed your very good deed and back to Callahan's
Some new people have entered the bar
Talk to Al Phee and agree to help him

Call of Cthulhu Shadow Of The Comet Solution By Phil Darke Shadow Of The Comet by Infogrames is quite an old game and by the standards of today's point and click adventures a bit dated and rather slow but once I got started I found it very atmospheric and I enjoyed playing it
You John Parker arrive in Illsmouth in to photograph the passing of Halley rsquo s Comet and also to investigate what happened to professor Boleskine who also had been on the mission the last time the comet passed in
DAY ONE You are escorted to your lodgings the home of Dr Cobble where you also meet the mayor Mr Arlington
In your room pick up and read the diary and telegram
Examine the contents of the trunk
It is a good idea at this stage to explore the village without actually doing anything but just find your way around
Later on in the game you will need to know where various people live and I found it useful to make a rough sketch of the map and note on it the names of the various characters and the location of their houses
Although there is a map M key provided in the game it only gives the principal locations i e
Post Office General Store Town Hall etc and although houses are shown it doesn't tell you who lives there
Next you need to find some photographic plates
Go to the general store and talk to Gloria Tilton en route
Mr Myer in the store will tell you that the plates he has are rather old and you should test them to make sure they are still OK Next you want to find out who Boleskine's guide was in
So head for the town hall and enter
Look at the base of the statue and read the document
Talk to Tobias Jugg
The famous author is Shakespeare and you simply love to read
Keep talking until Jugg leaves then look in the cupboard at the back and take the magnifying glass
Next go to the fishery and talk to Hambleton but he is not very helpful although you will learn of a Calvary in the forest
Go into the forest you will not be able to find the Calvary yet but find three sticks and a vine
Go to Juggs house and look at the gun in the corridor and use the magnifying glass on it
Return to your lodgings via the main square
Here you will see a crowd of gypsies who are being harassed by Sgt
Baggs
Stick up for them and when he leaves talk to them
When you get back to your room look in the dresser for some cotton wool and in the drawer for some alcohol
Use the alcohol on the cotton wool and use it on Boleskins drawing which is in the trunk
By combining the clues you found on the gun and on the drawing you will learn that the Calvary is north of the Beast constellation and East of the Stalker constellation at this point a group of by two stars form a small square mark a cross here
Now you need to go and find a guide to take you there so head for the Tavern
Go into the Tavern and talk to the Inn keeper and to Nathan Tyler but do not accept his suggestion Leave the Inn and you will see some thugs attacking Webster
Pick up the bat near the wall of the inn and go to his aid
After you have seen off the thugs take Webster to the drug store
After the pharmacist has seen to Webster talk to him and he will agree to meet you in front of the town hall this evening
Return to your room and collect your camera tripod plates lens and map
Now head for the town hall
If when you get there Webster says he can not help you then you have marked the cross in the wrong place on the map
If all is well he will take you into the forest but gets scared and runs off after pointing you in the right direction taking your tripod with him
Cross the bridge to the north and use the three sticks and the vine to construct a makeshift tripod
Use the camera and plates and take your pictures
Go East form here and watch the cat
Look at the bush which it disappeared into go through and watch the ceremony which takes place at the stone circle
Pick up the parchment and get out
You pass out and awaken in your room
DAY TWO Dr Cobble gives you a serious talking to and a prescription so follow his advice and go directly to the Pharmacy
While the pharmacist is making up the prescription you can develop your photos
Take the developing ingredients from the shelves in the drug store you should have eight bottles
Now go into the dark room and switch on the red lamp
Put the plates in the trays use metol and hydroquinone to develop them and then use sodium thiosulphate and potash metabisulfite to fix them
Now look at the results
You collapse and are saved by Mathews
Now go to the general store and pick up the key which was left on the counter and while you are there buy some more plates and a brooch and a locket
Now go to Jugg's house and use the key to open the door
In the hallway pick up the statue of a baby
Now go into the next room and take the statue of an old man from the cupboard and in the next corridor take the statue of a young man from the glass case
Enter the room and look at the left hand side of the rug about half way up
You will find a small key
Remove the following books from the bookcases Youth The Invisible Man and The Old Man And The Sea
Replace them with the statues of the baby young man and old man respectively
A secret entrance now opens you go through and find Jugg dying show him the parchment
Listen carefully to his dying words
Use the key to open the Necromicon and read it but don't try to take it with you
Take the message from the table and leave
Sgt
Baggs is convinced that you are responsible for Juggs murder so you must avoid him by going home through the village square and past the pharmacy any other way and you get caught
Once home read the message it mentions a hundred messages and three colours this refers to the post office so go there next
After talking to Miss Guildchrist you can go upstairs to talk to Mr Underwood
He will give you a great deal of information
Next you need to consult a bible to read the Apocalypse according to St John
Outside the post office you should encounter the straight laced Miss Picott
Talk to her and tell her that you are sorry if your behaviour upsets her
Give her the locket and she will now lend you her bible
Next go to the town hall and talk to the clerk
Tell him that the Mayor has given you permission to take some photos from his office window but tell him that you are the reporter not the photographer
You can now enter up to the mayor's office
The safe combination is the page number of the Apocalypse Of St John
Open the safe and get the cigar case and open it
Inside is a deposit slip
Read the diary it talks about a place where earth air and sea come together this is the lighthouse
Go to the post office and use the deposit slip to get a package
This contains a dress
Go to fishery and pick up the rope ladder
Go to the well and get changed into the dress

THE END GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
CALSOON WALKTHROUGH
th May Len Green lengreen hotmail com This walkthrough covers all the necessary steps to finish the game successfully There are most probably interesting amp or amusing episodes which have not been included but which are not essential There are also doubtless some actions which have been included but which are not essential for merely completing the game
Although not formally separated quot Calsoon quot is divided into two separate halves Although quite different each half is very approximately equal in length and difficulty I have inserted a dividing line between the two parts
The usual instructions for all Quest Adventure games apply Pick up everything not nailed down Talk to everybody until the dialog tree is exhausted You are never 'killed' in this game but occasionally if you make a bad move you are returned to just before you made it Save often there are only save slots but you can easily save batches of saves and zip them for compactness if you wish etc etc
You may wish to turn up your monitor brightness amp or gamma setting since some interiors are dark During the first half of the game you may find it convenient to go to the options panel and set your menu to the bottom of the screen otherwise some texts high up on the screen may be difficult to read During the second half of the game it is highly advisable to go to the options panel and set your menu to the top of the screen see for the reasons for this

The next puzzle is more complex than previous ones So instead of simply giving instructions what to do it will be split into parts The first quot Part I quot thro' will be a 'tour' around the locations involved That may be sufficient to eliminate stuckness If not the second quot Part II quot thro' will give the full spoiler
Part I
This part only describes how to get to the various essential locations You are advised to look around at each location but no actions are specified If you wish to try out your own actions please go ahead you can't 'spoil' anything If not you can wait until quot Part II quot
Go W N through C E through B Look around at everything It might be helpful to save here and keep for later reference
Go W then N through A Climb the ladder Look around at everything
Go S through the opening F Look around at everything and note the button B amongst other things
Watch out for the demon setters fierce dogs
Go N through the opening F down the ladder go S through the opening A go S through the opening C and climb the ladder Look around at everything and note the button B amongst other things
Go down the ladder go E then N through the opening E Look around at everything and note the button B amongst other things
Go S through the opening E go E go N through the opening D Look around at everything and note the button B amongst other things
Part II
The rooms containing buttons B B B and B are all basically identical the only exception being the room containing B which has a hole in the floor which the others haven't got In each of them you can't remain too long at a stretch or the demon setters will expel you but you can easily return for additional stints
In each of the rooms try looking through the window the down arrow gets you out pressing the appropriate button then looking through the window again Have you seen what mechanism is at work here
the answer to this is as follows
Each time you press any button one of the wooden blocks in the room whose opening is B moves down one position You don't have to traipse to that room to see this looking through the window near to the button gives you an immediate view of the inside of that room
Did you take note of the positions of the blocks of wood before you caused any of them to move In case you didn't they were as follows numbering the blocks from W left to E right thro' was in the lowest possible position and in the highest possible position Each block can take up positions from the highest through to the lowest inclusive They only move downwards except after they reach the bottom most position the next move causes them to jump up to the top most position
Button B operates wooden block button B operates wooden block button B operates wooden block and button B operates wooden block
The object of the exercise is to enable Tork to cross the bottomless pit and enter the room at the NE corner of the screen There could be several ways of doing this but only one is acceptable to the game
Block was in its 'correct' position before you started i e
with the top edge of that block level with the bottom edge of the platform at the NE corner So if you haven't previously moved it you shouldn't alter its position now Each of the other blocks must be one step only below forming a staircase downwards i e must be step below must be step below and must be step below
Go to the appropriate rooms and press buttons B B and B each its appropriate number of times You can check with each corresponding window that you've got it right but don't take too long or the demon setters will interfere
From wherever you are go to the opening B and enter If you've arranged the wooden blocks correctly Tork will tell you so
Jump onto the staircase you have arranged and Tork will hop up to the top Go N through the opening G and enter into another room
Look at and activate the panel nothing doing maybe dangerous
Pick up the book in a foreign language I
Fill up your empty mug I with water from the pool and you get a mug full of water I
Go S through the opening G jump down the stairs go W go N through the opening A go E to Skully

Use your hammer I to smash the magnifying glass I and you get a few pieces of glass I
Use your file I to smooth the shards of glass I and you get a pair of lenses I
Use the pair of lenses I on the roll of copper wire I and you've created a pair of glasses I
Give the pair of glasses I to Skully
Talk to Skully and get him to translate the book He informs you of the simple steps to find the portal and return to earth
Go W go S through the opening A go E through the opening B go up the stairs go through the opening G to the panel
Activate the panel You obtain panel pieces
This is a simple jig saw like puzzle The center piece is stuck to the panel and cannot move but all the other pieces can To move any piece move the hand finger cursor onto it and click the left mouse button then move the piece to where you want it to go When the piece is in its exact correct position click the right mouse button to release and fix it there
You can assemble a 'picture' but one piece appears to be missing To exit click the down arrow

Pour the water from your mug I into the hole it only fills it half way
Retrace your steps the opposite of and again fill up your empty mug I with water from the pool and again you get a mug full of water I
Retrace your steps again exactly as in and again pour the water from your mug I into the hole This time it fills the hole completely and there's a small stone floating in the water
Interact with the hole You get a stone with markings on it I
Return again to the room with the panel the opposite of Place the stone I onto the panel
Interact with the panel
This time similarly to you obtain panel pieces but this time pieces instead of
Assemble the 'picture' as described in If nothing happens when you've completed the 'picture' it means that you haven't put all the pieces exactly into position Each panel piece has small jagged edges which must mesh accurately with other pieces If you are unsure whether you've got the correct 'picture' the next few hints describe how to assemble it
Two of the pieces each have one only distinctly rounded corner Those rounded corners have to go into the positions NE and SW One only of the pieces has two distinctly rounded corners That piece goes to the NW One piece includes what looks somewhat like a fairly small man with a black hat holding something in his hands This piece goes to the SE
Of the remaining pieces the one with part of a head and two large eyes goes to the N The part with a man a bit larger than the abovementioned man and without any hat goes to the S The part with a fairly large black oval goes to the E Finally the last moveable piece which seems like part of some sort of column goes to the W When you have assembled the picture correctly Tork will say quot Oooooh
I think I've triggered something quot If this doesn't happen it is most likely that all of the moveable panel pieces do not fit exactly and have to be adjusted slightly

Normally I encourage people not to print walkthroughs it's better to open them in their browser on or off line it doesn't matter then switch between the game and the walkthrough by pressing Alt Tab
Unfortunately this game does not allow switching between applications
For that reason I have written a second walkthrough a printable checklist style listing of tasks simple and to the point
It is possible to die get killed actually so what I'm giving you right up front are the places where you should be careful to save your game and how to survive the various attackers
This way those of you who want to survive those parts and still want to explore the rest of the game on your own without everything being spoiled can check right here
Here are the trouble spots in the sequence they appear Enter the Hotel
Look to the right and find theCairo Newspaperstory about a man going berserk in the marketplace
Speak to the Conci rge who gives you the key to room and informs you that Mo ra has gone to the Museum
Upstairs find your room by turning left then right after reaching the top of the stairs
Look on the nightstand and take thekey to the Museumand read the note from Mo ra
On the other nightstand find thebrochure Look in your attach case and take yourlockpicksandflashlight Go downstairs to the lobby
The conci rge is away from his desk giving you the opportunity to read thehotel register The cab has honked he is ready to take you to the museum
Please feel to explore the entire Museum
There are many exhibits to see but unfortunately there is not much to learn from them
I was anxious to read descriptions or possibly listen to tour tapes but none of that exists
There is the main floor an upstairs area and a basement
You came here to find Mo ra
Let's look for her in the offices
Upon entering the Museum go RF LF LF L You are facing a locked door with some carving on it
Try the lockpicks to get in
This is the Curator's office
There isn't much to do in here right now but have a look at a couple of things thedesk drawerwith some odd things in it and a locked chest with anAnkh symbol on it
Let's assume we need an ankh shaped key of some sort
Pick the lock on the other door to find your way into Mo ra's office
You can confirm it's her office by peeking in her purse
There is a tiny key there but you can't take it yet
Look at the items on the desk
There is acard describing Isfet
It goes into your inventory
Look at the report to see an inventory of items from the dig site
Look also in the card catalog
There are several cards to read but only one goes into your inventory thecard describing M at
Looks like we have a conflict of good and evil going on
Exit the other door from Mo ra's office to return to the Museum's exhibits
Turn right forward once and look right to find the display case containing theAnkh Sharpen your lock picking skills once again to retrieve the device
Return to the Curator's office and use the Ankh to open that locked chest
There is afancy keywaiting there for you
Take it and exit the office
Go upstairs using the right side of the nearest staircase and turn right again
You are looking for a locked door
Use that new key to enter and go through the red curtain
This appears to be a ceremonial room of some sort but not much is happening
You can find an empty chest on the floor and two empty niches on opposite walls
The setup in the center of the room appears to be an altar of some sort
Exit the room and return to the curator's office
You will be stopped by the Curator the guy in the fez and escorted to a quot meeting with Mo ra quot Actually he traps you in a store room in the basement
Besides that the lights are turned off
Use the flashlight to find your way around
Looking to the left you discover the light switch
Try it
Oh no there is a broken wire inside
Go all the way to the other end of the room and look on the floor to your left
Find thewire fragment Use the wire to repair the switch and turn on the lights
Now you are able to explore some other objects in the room
You could peek inside the sarcophagus if you like
After you look closely at the crate with the label for the Cairo Museum you will hear someone approaching
Turn left and duck behind the statue
Don't try to hide in the sarcophagus
At the end of the cutscene you and the Germans have returned to the Hotel
As you enter the Hotel turn around and look under the cab
Find a piece of paper the Germans must have dropped
The Conci rge is away from his post again so go behind the desk and take the key to Mo ra's room
Go inspect her room
It is on the opposite side of the hotel from your room
Only two items of interest in her room a note from the curator to be found in the nightstand and herDiary on the top shelf in the wardrobe
As you depart the room you can hear La Destri re dishing up some sweet talk
After that scene go to the bar downstairs and have a conversation with the German guy sitting in the corner
He'sHerr Doktor Maximilian von Bosardigheist
The scene will end on a sour note
Read the newspaper sitting there on the table
Now go to your room to find someone has ransacked it
What could they be looking for
And where's that voice coming from
Pick up the chair and place it under the air vent to overhear the two Germans talking in the next room
Head back to the Museum
Let's check out the ceremony room
Someone's been here
You can almost feel the aura left over from some kind of ceremony
Have a little ceremony of your own
Examine the altar
Take theglass bottleand pour its contents into the ceremonial cup
Put thefeatherinto the liquid and crush it with thepestle
Now use theblue jugto collect the material you have created
Look in the two niches on the wall and retrievetwo statuettes
Also look in the chest on the floor to discover the items that were in the Curator's desk
Return to the Curator's office and go to the ankh chest
Place the two statues in their places and click to open the next drawer
Use the objects found there to construct aBalance Pour the concoction you made into the scale pan to balance it and open the final drawer
Take theWarehouse Key
The door to the basement level if you haven't already explored down there is diagonally opposite from the offices in the same corridor where you first arrived
Go down two levels turn around and examine the tool shelves
Find theBolt Cutters Take them and open the tool box sitting on the floor
Take thePry Barfrom the box
Use your Warehouse Key to enter
This is the same room where you were trapped before
Look at the coffin
Previously you could open it and it was empty
Now it is chained shut
Use the bold cutters on the chain
Look inside
Think you're having a bad day
Pity the poor caretaker
Look at the crate you examined before and use the pry bar to open it
Take the note inside
It's a clue
Go to the Hotel
As you return to the Hotel the Conci rge presents you with a pair of tickets for the Wonder of the Nile and an invitation from M de la Destri re to join him in the cocktail lounge aboard the boat
Have a look in your inventory
Everything unnecessary is gone thankfully
Notice your key to room
The sensible thing is to have a look in your room
There's not much to do in there you can't even open your own luggage
Go into the bathroom and look under the sink
Holy Smoke
Literally
What in the world is going on down there
Exit your room
You are able to knock on doors and but you have no key and the lockpicks aren't up to the task
Go back up to the middle deck
Go to the sunny side of the boat and enter the bar
Talk to the bartender
It seems he's the twin brother of the Conci rge
The Countess comes in and speaks with you
Whew she's a strange one
Look at the table examine the brochure describing the area and eat one of the Turkish Delights
Yummm
Go to the end of the corridor where Room is
See the trapdoor on the floor
Find the tool to open it in the little box on the wall
Look behind you to find aladder
Put the ladder down the trapdoor and climb into the hold
Your flashlight will come in handy
Before walking around look to your left and discover aHammersitting on the barrel
Take it and go into the next compartment
Examine a locked chest that looks like it might belong to the Germans
Go to the next gate discover that it is locked but you can see what's inside in the close up view
Holy Smoke
That's where the orange fumes are coming from
Climb out of the hold and return to the middle deck where the outdoor tables are
A cutscene plays showing la Destri re being attacked
The barman will tend to him while you look around
Go down to the staterooms and listen at la Destri re's door
Go up to the shady side of the middle deck and go down the outer stairs
Peek in the window
La Destri re is being hypnotized by the Curator
This would be a good time to snoop around the Curator's room
Unfortunately the lockpicks still don't work
Go to the bar only to discover the barman taking a little nap
Look behind him and discover thetwo keyssitting on his wallet
One of the keys is a passkey to the whole boat
Handy
While you are there eat another Turkish Delight
Seems someone else likes them too
Also notice the book on the table by the shady side door
That wasn't there before
Seems like one of the Germans is into some pretty heady stuff
Sein und Zeit tr
quot Being and Time is by the philosopher Martin Heidegger and has to do with Being and it's connection with inanimate objects
Maybe he's trying to understand the power of the statuettes
Or maybe he's about to go right off the deep end
von B didn't sound too philosophical when we talked to him before
Go to room and unlock it
In the nightstand drawer find theBeliever's Book This little volume is chock full ofuseful clues
Something about four deities They are Horus Ra Isis and Osiris what the clue is for we don't know yet
Also something about three scarabs red blue and green
Also the symbols for and
Hey those look familiar
Check out the papyrus you found before
It's not yet possible to guess what the numbers are for but you can at least decipher some of it
It seems like there are four instructions six times three times five times and twice
Look in the closet and find theM at Statue
Unlock la Destri re's door room
He's in some kind of trance
Notice the ornate ring on his hand
Open his luggage and notice the emblem from the ring
Go into the bathroom and take a bar of soap
Also notice the disguise kit
What's he up to anyway
Use the soap on his ring finger take the ring and use it on the emblem in the suitcase and take thediving mask
theraspand thepaperin the passport
Look in the closet
Find the key hanging out of one of the pockets
In the far corner of the room is an Enigma Code machine
Open it and click on it to receive a message
Hmm that strange note from the crate said something about numbers corresponding and letters in place
Let's try to decode that thing
Looks pretty easy
I can't help it if their spelling is not perfect
The message is clear enough
Exit the room and go down the stairs to the entrance to the hold
Use the Warehouse key to unlock the control box on the wall
Turn the crank to unlock the door to the ramp
Go down the ramp
and look around
That little key you just found will open the German's locked chest
Holy TNT Batman there's enough here to blow the pyramids
Use the rasp to cut through the chain on the gate
Look in the coffin only to discover the statuette and package of incense
Return to the Curator's room
Read the message on the headboard
You will hear a peculiar voice outside the door
If you didn't take my quot save your game quot advice a minute ago please do it now
The Mummy is right there and he attacks you
You have only seconds to survive
If you like try shooting him with your pistol
However he has been dead for centuries so that's no help
Instead use the Statuette on him to counteract evil with good
Oooohhh
You wake up in your own room and have a brief conversation with the Countess
As you leave someone slips a note under the door
Read it
Go up to the middle deck and step toward the shady side of the boat
You can see that the boat is docked at an island
You see and hear an explosion
It seems the archeologists are at work
Before going to the island you have some items to retrieve
Go the the curator's room andfind your pistol dropped during the struggle
It's on the floor behind the bed
Now go down to the hold again
No surprise the dynamite is gone
Look under the ramp and take theSteel Bar Go to the coffin
It's gone too
They sure have a lot of mobile corpses
Look to the right and take theRope Time to visit the island
Go to the small boat
You see a light flashing from the top of the hill
Step forward toward the bow
This takes you halfway to shore
Step forward again
This takes you to the dock
To return to the Wonder of the Nile enter the small boat and step twice toward the stern
Step on land and go toward the warehouse
Enter it and when you step into the room someone locks you in
Shades of Loch Ness
Straight ahead from the entrance there are some barrels next to the wall
Look behind the barrels and pick up theIron Rod Go into the middle of the shelves and look for a box ofPitons Take some
Against the far wall near the other door is a waste bucket
Find theMirror Fragment On the right side of the door is a broken area you can peek through
SeeKarl Blitzstrum von Bosardigheist's assistant
He's the dude from the introductory cutscene
You see him once then he is out of view
Use the mirror on the hole to see where he is
Step away and hear him leave
Look in the mirror again to confirm that he is gone
Now how to get through that door
since you do not have the key
Try this looking close up at the bottom of the door put the Wonder of the Nile brochure under the door and give it a push
Now use the Iron Rod to dislodge the key
You can hear it fall
Now quot Eeeeasy quot pull the brochure toward you
Gotcha
Collect the brochure unlock the door and enter the operations office
Across the room you can look at a map of the area on the wall
Also turn left toward the filing cabinets and go forward
Look up and right to read records of the excavations
Looks like someone has taken the information on Pinkerbottom's work out of the book
Next to the rear exit see the newspaper clipping showing Pinky Mo ra and de la Dest
with their two statuettes
Go out the back door and climb the hill
You reach an impasse and wonder how the view is from up there
Turn around and anchor your rope to the previous iron rungs
Then facing the cliff put a Piton into a crack and hammer it in securely
Then attach the rope to the Piton
Go up and attach the rope to the bottom rung
This lets you climb to the top
Have a look around
You can see the boat from here and on the ground it looks like the Germans have been here
Cigarette butts and an empty flask litter the area
Take a look through that telescope
Oh
Mo ra and the Curator what
The Mummy attacks the Curator and seems to have control of Mo ra
He also has exceptional eyesight being able to look right through the telescope at you
Just so you know it's there go over the back side of the hill and see the rope and pulley apparatus
You'll be coming back
Now climb down the hill
After about five steps down you spy the Mummy
Again you have only seconds before he discovers you and it's all over
Turn around and look uphill
There are two ways to go
Before you took the path to the right
This time take the path to the left hiding from the Mummy until he goes elsewhere
Use that key to open the metal box in your inventory
You could wait until the end of the game to open the box but you will be in sort of a hurry at that time and might not think to unlock it
Go back to the big boat and into the Curator's room
Yikes
Another zoned out specimen
Look at his hands and take theScarab Medallion Look at his neck and take aTiny Key Look on the nightstand behind the plant and take anotherTiny Key Those two keys are for his luggage
Use one to open the case and the other to open the compartment inside
Take theStatuette Go into the bathroom
There's that ceremonial urn again
Use the Scarab Medallion in the urn to activate it and take it back
Return to the island
As you reach the island there is a path to the left that takes you to a small stone marker
Use the Scarab Medallion on the bottom indentation to reveal aBlue Scarabat the top
Take the Blue Scarab first then the Medallion
To be on the safe side look in your inventory to confirm you have kept both the scarab and the medallion
Enter the small boat
Look closely at the barrels and find theSteel Wheel Use the small boat to return to the mainland
This time go to the left and find another stone marker
Use the Medallion to create aRed Scarab Take them both
Now climb way back up to the top where the telescope is and find the pulley mechanism
In your inventory combine the Steel Rod you found on the big boat with the wheel
Use the wheel to ride down the cable
Whee
I love it when he rolls his eyes
Go forward and down the rung ladder
Be sure to look around you have dropped theScarab Medallionand you will need it
Boy it sure is hot
So hot in fact that if you don't find a drink of water soon you will perish
Go directly to the tents
You can only enter one and find the chest to the left
You will find a canteen of fresh water saving your life
Also take thelamp oiland thelighter Go into the tent to find Pinkerbottom has been zombiefied by the mummy
Take the map from the table
Exit the tent and proceed counter clockwise around the outer perimeter of the Pit to find the final stone marker
Use the medallion and get theGreen Scarab Check your inventory
Do you have thepistol the mask all three scarabs and the scarab medallion
If not you will have to return to the warehouse area somehow
To do that go down in the pit and find the ladder
You can exit the dig site by finding your way around to a rockfall and use the ladder to scale it
You can always come back via the pulley
If however you do have all the items you can proceed and ignore the ladder
Proceed into the Four Pillars Room
Now more of the clues in the Believer's Book become relevant
Near the back of the book is a two page riddle suggesting a sequence of deities and also suggesting that all is not as it seems at first glance
Part of the problem lies in identifying who is who
As you enter the room the pillar to your right is a goddess
She must be Isis the only female in the group
To the left is the bird god Horus
Going forward to the next two on the right is Osiris and on the left is Ra
On the outer wall opposite each pillar is a door containing an ankh shaped depression
Straight ahead is a fifth door with agolden ankhin place
Take it
After it's in your inventory examine it to see the symbol engraved on it
That is Isis
Place the ankh on her door to open it
Inside you will be able to take another ankh
Examine it
Looks like a bird
Use it to open Horus' door
Take the new ankh from the statue
Examine it
A man with a staff and double headdress
Must be Osiris
Open his door and by elimination the last one must be Ra the god with the circular headdress
Don't mix him up with Horus also with a round thing on his head
Open Ra's door and take the final ankh examine it and compare the icon to the image of M at above
Yep this is the final one the ankh that will open the fifth door
Use it on the door and take it back to open the door
Also go around the Pillars room andretrieve the other four ankhs
You should have five now and in your inventory slots they are from left to right M at Isis Horus Osiris and Ra
You can confirm this by sliding your cursor over them and seeing the symbols in the magnified window
Now for the sarcophagus
You have seen those seven hieroglyphs several times before and you can review them now in the Book of the Believers
You must press the buttons on the lid in the correct sequence
They are arranged on the lid in almost the reverse order that you see in the book except that two of them are reversed
Press then in this order As you proceed down and into the corridors you are hampered by a heavy fog
Besides that it's lethal
Put on the mask and the timer stops
You are safe more or less
Observe that the mask contains a compass
You only need to know which way to go
The clue is found on that papyrus with the symbols and walking figures
Read the Believers Book to translate the symbols for and Interpret the clues thus The top row says followed by six walking men
This means you should walk in a direction of six times
If you do it correctly you see the fog change color
The complete directions are steps steps steps and steps If you need to return missing inventory perhaps you can do so by reversing the path
The complete steps are steps steps steps and steps
Enter the central temple
You will see Karl Blitzstrum one last time meeting his demise at the hands of the Mummy
You must find a way to prevent the same thing from happening to you
Go around the perimeter of the pit until you find the projecting ledge the first step in a descending staircase which is retracted
There is an ankh depression in the step
In order to extend the steps you must place the correct ankh in the imprint
The sequence is the same as it was in the Pillars Room
Start with Isis
Her ankh is the second one from the left in your inventory she wears a flat crown
If you choose correctly you hear the steps sliding into place
If not well it's Game Over
Be glad you saved
To extend the second set use Horus the bird
For the third set Osiris will work
Now you must stop him
The timer is running
Use the pistol to shoot the statuette he is praying to
There's not much time now use the Ra ankh to reveal the final stairs
If you did not think to unlock the Scarab Chest before do it now
Use the chest on the Mummy to paralyze him for a moment
The timer runs again
Use the Statuette from your inventory to finish him off
Now the pressure is off but Mo ra must be revived
Place the Scarab Medallion around her neck and sail off into the sunset

Now he will face the final steps to stop the horrible resurrection of all the vizir rsquo s power
To complete this level you will need information you collected in previous levels and again you will face some timed challenges
You begin this level in the Four Pillars Room
Each pillar is dedicated to an Egyptian god goddess Re Osiris Horus and Isis
On the wall in front of each pillar is a stone door
On each stone door is a similar imprint the ankh symbol
Directly opposite to the entrance door is a fifth stone door also bearing the same imprint but on this door there is actually a key in the imprint
Take the key
This key is the Isis ankh
This ankh key allows you to open one of the four pillar stone doors which in turn releases a key to another door and so on until all four doors are opened
You must open the doors in a special sequence for if you do not you will be trapped in the room you open out of sequence and you will trigger a Game Over
The clue to the sequence can be found in the Believer rsquo s Book you have in your inventory from the curator rsquo s room
The first door to open is the Isis door ndash this is the door to the right as you entered the room
Inside is a statue bearing Horus rsquo ankh
The next door to open is the Horus door which is the door to the left as you entered the room
Inside is Osiris rsquo ankh
The next door is Osiris rsquo door which is the door beside Isis rsquo door
Inside is Ra rsquo s ankh
The last door to open is Ra rsquo s door which is the door beside Horus rsquo door
Inside is Maat rsquo s ankh
Maat rsquo s ankh opens the fifth door the door directly opposite the main entrance and the door you took the original ankh key from

You must press it in the right order to slide the sarcophagus sideways and discover the stairs hidden under the sarcophagus
The solution is in the Believer rsquo s Book
Once opened you see that the bottom of the stair disappear in the mist
If you go straight in the mist you will get lost and trigger a Game Over
Take the special glasses mask you took from the suitcase of De la Destri re as they contain a compass

You see an interesting cut scene
Move forward into the pit area and follow around until you arrive at the small platform sticking out into the middle of the pit
On the platform is the imprint of an ankh
You must place the Isis ankh to reveal the stairs to the next platform
Then place the Horus Osiris and Re same order as the pillars room ankhs
If you place the wrong life cross you will trigger a game over
The ankh keys are as follows Isis one wearing a lsquo crown rsquo headdressHorus birdOsiris one holding a staff and wearing a lsquo double rsquo tall headdressRa one wearing a lsquo round rsquo headdress On the fourth platform you will be able to see what the commotion is at the bottom of the pit
The Mummy Amenophet is performing a ceremony to retrieve his ancient power by Isfet

Quickly in inventory combine the key and the chest to unlock the scarab chest and use the scarab on the Mummy to control him
A clue on how to do this is on La Destriere rsquo s paper or he will kill you
When you have completed this correctly the Mummy will be paralyzed but still filled with the power of Isfet
Quickly use the statuette of Tchoumchekti rsquo s Ka to destroy him
Now that the world is safe again you must wake up Mo ra

CelticaWalkthrough byDan KennedyAugust Introduction Picture a blender Pour in two partsMyst one partZork Nemesis several books on Irish history and occultism that reference book in every adventure game developer rsquo s collection that contains all those zodiac and alchemy symbols and add a touch of the th Guest Puree pour onto two CD ROMs and serve
As you may have guessed there really isn rsquo t much aboutCelticathat is terribly original not that there rsquo s anything wrong with that Celticadoes almost drip with its influences Mystbeing the primary one but it rsquo s a good quality and engaging game The story which takes place on a mysteriously abandoned island off the western coast or Ireland is well designed and immersive The graphics are quite evocative although presented in the very dated ldquo slideshow rdquo format and the sound effects music really set a haunting mood
The problem is of course the invariable comparisons to its predecessors andCelticais certainly noMyst For all the haunting atmosphere the pretty green and grey locales the mystery Celticaessentially asks the player to run around an island collecting pages jewels and harp strings Unlike the puzzles ofMystorNemesis which are well integrated into the story and had you working towards some practical goal the puzzles of Celtica are just excuses to reward players with collectibles
However the real let down is in the puzzle design ndash there are a number of poorly designed puzzles in the game that simply do not give enough information to the player to allow them to solve it themselves
Celtica rsquo s outdated game play andMyst iness ensured it a drubbing at the hands of critics and its reportedly heavy price tag assured it a short run in retail the game is a rarity these days and fetches a princely sum on E bay It rsquo s pretty safe to say that if you likedMyst you will certainly get some enjoyment out ofCeltica and if you hatedMyst don rsquo t bother with the game
A quality enjoyable game just don rsquo t expect a great deal of originality
Tower of Power The game begins with a quick description of the Otherworld myth ndash gods landing on an island off the coast of Ireland and leaving several artifacts behind ndash the Ascension Amulet the Ascension Harp and the Book of Ascension A group of monks pitched up on the island in the thcentury but were chased off by Vikings before they could find anything The narrator also mentions a group of artists the ldquo Children of Kerry rdquo who attempted to establish a community on the island at the end of the thcentury only to perish during the winter of
Once the actual game begins you will find yourself at one of two locations on the island Pan around until you see either the base of a stone tower with a wooden ladder leading into it or a long bridge leading to a gazebo If you rsquo ve found the tower go ahead and enter it by clicking on the forward pointing arrow If you rsquo ve found the bridge turn to your right the right pointing arrow move forward to the tower and enter
If you rsquo ve looked around a bit you rsquo ve seen the pretty green and grey hills of the island Make sure you do spend some time looking from side to side as you travel between locations on the island The graphics play a big part in creating the haunting mood of the game and should be savoured
Inside the tower click on the ladder rising up into the tower in front of you Click again on the opening above to climb onto the next floor Nothing here ndash continue upward and click on the entrance to the top floor Turn around until you see a writing desk and a telescope Click on the telescope note the ldquo hand rdquo icon to get a view of a gazebo at the end of a long bridge Back away from the telescope view click the ldquo down rdquo arrow and click on the sign on the wall above the desk The passage mentions something about collecting books and the monks and Vikings
Planets and Alchemy and Symbols Oh My
There are three items on the desk ndash click on the box to the left and note the two keyholes on the box in the close up view We rsquo ll obviously need a key to get into the box Next back away and click on the book to the right ndash the volume is automatically inserted into your book collection To access the books press the right hand button along the top of the screen Select the book you want to read using the arrow buttons above the picture of the books and press the button to the left of the picture to access the text The book is filled with all the tools of the adventure gamers trade planetary information zodiac symbols the Greek alphabet ndash it rsquo s all here
Click away from the book to return to the game and click on the box on the centre of the desk Seven strange symbols are found along the perimeter of a circle with coloured sticks below The symbols and circle should look familiar ndash you just saw them in the book open it up to confirm if you rsquo ve already forgotten The second page of the book shows the exact same circle with the same symbols the Chaldean Order and indicates a celestial body to go with each symbol The first page of the book includes information about how each celestial body is associated with a day of the week In addition a passage appears at the bottom of the page ldquo Trace magic order hellip starting at the sun the swiftest out to the furthest and slowest rdquo Don rsquo t bother trying to figure this out ndash simply connect the symbols in the same order as the days of the week Pick up a stick from the set at the bottom of the board the colours are meaningless and connect two symbols by clicking both of the buttons of the symbols you want to connect Connect them in the following order Sun to Moon Sunday to Monday Moon to Mars Monday to Tuesday Mars to Mercury Tuesday to Wednesday Mercury to Jupiter Wednesday to Thursday Jupiter to Venus Thursday to Friday Venus to Saturn Friday to Saturday Saturn to Sun Saturday to Sunday The circle will dissolve to reveal a small brass key labelled Bernadette rsquo s Diary Key if you place the cursor over it and a picture of a house Take the key and back away from the board Turn around and descend the ladder to the second floor and continue on to the first floor Turn around and exit the tower
A Bridge Too Complicated Walk forward one step and turn to your right to spot a bridge leading off to a gazebo on its own small island Move forward and cross the bridge and approach a locked gate at its end The central panel is a picture of interwoven gold and orange bands that must be assembled before entry is gained
The panel is made up of nine squares that each rotate degrees in a counter clockwise direction when clicked Both the interwoven bands and the outer edge of the panel can be used as a guide to the proper alignment of each square From its initial position click each of the squares the number of times shown in the diagram to the left to complete the picture and open the gate
The gates pull back allowing you to proceed to the gazebo
Click on the sign located above the entrance to the gazebo ldquo The mother night that ushers in the dark half of the year begins with such a bright light so sonorous so clear rdquo Enter the gazebo and click on the wind chimes for a close up view Four of the chimes have zodiac symbols on them You can move each of the chimes by clicking first the chime you want to move and second the chime you want to replace it with The object here is to arrange the chimes in some designated order But what order
Blowin rsquo In the Wind The presence of the zodiac symbols and the words of the sign suggest time and since there are twelve chimes they must represent the months or at least periods of the year ldquo Begins with a bright light rdquo suggests that a summer month should be placed in the first location ndash the most obvious choice being the shortest chime with the Gemini II symbol on it
ldquo Ushers in the dark half of the year hellip rdquo suggests that the chimes should get progressively longer the longest chime with the Sagittarius symbol a line with an arrow through it should be in the seventh position and then get progressively shorter again ndash mimicking the cyclical nature of the year I know this explanation isn rsquo t too convincing but I warned you
As stated above place the shortest chime in the first position the second shortest in the thposition the third shortest in the ndposition the fourth shortest in the thposition and so on alternating the sides until the longest chime ends up in the seventh position Note that the chimes in the thand thpositions are exactly the same length ndash the one with the Libra symbol two lines top one has a bump should go in the thposition and the one with the Aries symbol a skinny ram rsquo s head should be in the thposition
Note that the zodiac symbols can be used as a rough guide for placement of the chimes but are actually misleading To be correctly balanced the chime with the Libra symbol should have had a Virgo symbol on it and the chime with the Aries symbol should have a Pisces symbol on it
Once the chimes are placed correctly they sway slightly in the breeze and a drawer opens at the bottom of the frame Click on the wire inside the drawer ndash this is one of the strings of the Ascension Harp When any part of the three scared objects is collected a tracking graphic appears indicating how many of the pieces of the Harp on the right the Amulet in the centre and the Book at the bottom have been collected A small map of the island is also present over to the left You can access this graphic by clicking on the centre button at the top of the screen Back away from the wind chimes and turn around to face another telescope Click on the eyepiece to spy a small key located on the green roof of another gazebo off in the distance Back away from the telescope and move forward towards the bridge again Cross the bridge back to the mainland and turn to the right
Walk forward towards the remains of the thcentury monastery Only a small round building remains intact ndash click on the brown wooden door just to your right to enter the building Walk forward into the room and then keep turn to the right past the single stained glass window until you can see a small table with papers on it just to the right of the door you entered through Click on the table to look closer and pick up the three rolls to the left the cursor indicates that these are organ rolls and each plays a different tune The remaining books on the table date from the time of the monks and are of no concern
Back away and turn to the right to see some sort of prayer area Click forward to view a set of three windows covered with a large red curtain Click on the rope to the left of the curtain to reveal the windows on the left side Now find the hotspot at the very top of the rope to the right of the curtain to reveal the windows to the right We get a close up of the top of the right window with the eye of a glass swan gleaming in the sunlight Click on the eye ndash it rsquo s a part of the Ascension Amulet
Back away and wait ndash the sun beam that pokes through the now empty eye of the swan is shining on something off to the right of the screen Turn to the right and note the floor tile that is slightly illuminated by the sunlight Click on the tile to remove it and grab a piece of the Book of Ascension in the cavity below Scan through the text but don rsquo t expect it to make much sense Back away from the hole turn around to face the exterior door and click forward twice to leave the chapel Turn to your right and move forward past the remains of the monastery
Them Bones You will soon arrive at the entrance to a cemetery with the solution to the bridge gate puzzle conveniently shown on the entrance posts Enter the cemetery turn to your right and click on the gravestone located in the centre of the screen Richard Francis Cabill ndash Back away turn back to the left and move forward again into the cemetery Turn to your left and click on the gravestone on the right side of the screen Franklin Morris Back away turn back to the right and take another step into the cemetery
Turn to your right and click on the gravestone located in the centre of the screen This is the grave marker of Bernadette O rsquo Donnell to whose diary key we already have Something bad obviously occurred in the year The epitaph reads ldquo And in the oblivion east was fire and evening was light by day by night rdquo Back away turn back to the left and take one more step into the cemetery The gravestone directly in front of you appears unmarked but there is a hotspot located at the top of the cross Evidently something must be placed here later in the game
Turn around and move one step back towards the entrance of the cemetery
Click on the gravestone on the left side of the screen Hans Otto Seaman U It sounds like this person may have been a crewman from a German U Boat Interesting ndash back away and move forward until you rsquo ve exited the cemetery
Turn to your right and walk towards the green roofed gazebo it rsquo s an ldquo arbour rdquo When close enough you get a view of the roof where you spotted the key in the telescope Pick up the key and then enter the arbour Turn to the left or right until you face a telescope which overlooks the cemetery with three eyepieces in a box to the left Pick up the left most eyepiece and then click on the telescope to look A blurry gravestone appears in the viewer ndash obviously we rsquo ve got the wrong powered lens Pick up the centre lens to change the power and look into the telescope again ndash this one gives us a clear view of Bernadette rsquo s gravestone The third lens on the right gives an even blurrier picture than the first
The High Road From the telescope turn to the right and move forward Keep going forward and let the path take you back past the cemetery the monastery and the bridge to the island gazebo Once you rsquo ve reached the tower where you started the game from enter it and climb the ladder to the top floor Turn around and click on the box on the left side of the desk Pick up the arbour key from your inventory and click on the left and right keyholes to open the box Click on the book inside to collect another part of the Book of Ascension
Quickly read the passage back away turn around and descend to the base of the tower Turn around and exit the tower door It rsquo s time to return to the arbour so move keep forward remember to turn left at the cemetery entrance until you reach the green roofed arbour Inside move directly forward without turning ndash this new path winds its way through some low hills to a windmill Keep moving forward until you stand in front of the windmill rsquo s door Enter the windmill and have a look around The main view of interest contains an organ to the left and the windmill rsquo s turning mechanism to the right Click on the plaque on the wall between the organ and the mechanism ndash something about the wind being music or possibly playing music with the wind Back away and click on the organ ndash the close up view has an on off knob to the left and a slot to hold the paper rolls in the centre Clicking the knob does little ndash clearly the organ is not receiving power
Back away and click forward towards the turning mechanism We get an upward view of the central shaft which is not presently turning Back away from the view and click on the lever sticking out of the ground to the right of the yellow panel The lever pushes forward and the mechanism seems to spring to life Try moving forward again ndash the central shaft is now turning
Gearing Up Click on the yellow panel and in the close up view click on the handle to the left of the panel to open the cover doors The panel contains several horizontal shafts metal gears located in six small shelves above and below the shafts and a number of pegs on which the gears can be placed The gears must be properly placed so as to connect the windmill rsquo s power to the organ which is presumably connected to the lowest shaft located in the bottom right corner of the panel
Begin by clicking on the gear in the lower right shelf and placing it on the wooden peg located between the two horizontal shafts in the top right corner of the panel Next grab the large gear in the top central shelf and place it on the peg in the middle of the panel this is the only peg that the large gear can fit on Next click on the gear in the top left shelf and place it immediately to the left of the lower shaft the one in the bottom right corner of the panel ndash the peg is to the left and a bit below the end of the shaft Now take the other small gear and place it on another peg located immediately up and to the left of the gear you just inserted Finally click on the gear in the bottom left shelf and place it to the left of the two small gears ndash when placed correctly you should only see the edge of the gear
Astute game players will notice the one empty shelf on the panel and the empty peg for a sixth gear located below the second horizontal shaft to the left of the big gear So it won rsquo t be a total disappointment to see that only the very first gear placed in the panel is turning when the panel is shut again Click on the left door of the panel to shut the doors We rsquo ve got a missing gear and until we find it we won rsquo t be able to make the organ play Take a last look around the windmill turn around to face the doorway and exit the structure Move forward until you rsquo ve entered the arbour again Death Gate Inside the arbour turn to your left twice and move forward Keep moving forward and follow the path ahead as it cuts through the lovely scenery Note the large house that becomes visible off in the distance The path eventually approaches a closed gate between two hills As you get close read the sign posted to the left of the gate ldquo From east south west and north of air fire water and earth at dawn noon evening and night be law love life and light rdquo
Back away and click on the gate itself for a close up view The lock mechanism has four wheels that join in the centre to display one word from each of the four groups of words on the sign Each of the four wheels can be turned by clicking on the side of the wheel furthest from the centre of the gate
Which words to we choose to select from each group Think of the locations on the island where we rsquo ve seen text ndash one in particular was highlighted for us with a telescope Bernadette rsquo s epitaph contained the words ldquo east rdquo rdquo fire rdquo ldquo evening rdquo and ldquo light rdquo Turn the wheels so that these four terms are displayed in the central area and the gate will open
A glitch in the game allows one to travel right through the gate without entering the four terms simply by clicking on the ldquo forward rdquo arrow directly above the wheel lock Oh well
Light Table Move forward until you approach the front of the large house at the end of this trail On the front patio turn to your left to find the front door and click there to enter Inside the front room turn to your left and approach the table with the gramophone on it Click on the gramophone to watch it wind up and play some blather about touching something
Turn around and step back to the door and then turn to the left to face away from the front entrance Move two steps into the room turn to the left and move forward ndash here is someone rsquo s pewter solar system model Turn around move forward a step and click on the grey object on the table straight ahead
The close up of the table rsquo s surface shows a light source in the top left corner glass prisms located in various positions and a grey object in the centre with a little metal doo dad in the top right corner The object here is to use the prisms to reflect the beam of light into the centre of the grey mass All four prisms can be rotated in place use the double green arrow cursor found somewhere near each prism and three of the four prisms can be move between locations the largest one to the right cannot be moved but can be rotated There rsquo s also a funny little switch right below the grey mass that may come into play as well
Start by placing the largest of the three moveable prisms in the bottom left location on the table To move the prisms click on the one you want to move and then click on its new location Now rotate this prism until two beams of light can be seen in it ndash the longest flat edge of the prism should be pointing upward Next rotate the prism located just above the bottom left one until a single beam of light can be seen in it again the longest flat edge of the prism should be pointed upward
Click on the metal switch just below the grey mass so that it is aligned horizontally Next rotate the big prism on the right until two beams of light are visible ndash the longest flat edge of the prism should be pointing to the left Finally rotate the final small prism in the centre so that the longest flat edge points down A glowing object appears in the centre of the grey mass Click on it to be rewarded with a piece of the amulet
Musical Memory At this point we rsquo ll take a detour up to the second floor so back away from the light table turn to your right move forward a step and then turn to the left or right to face either the left or right staircase to the second floor Follow the staircase up around and enter the doors at the top of the double staircase
You enter a music room that contains several musical instruments including a piano and a cello Turn to your right and click on the small box on a table against the wall Once the box opens click forward to look closer This is a double sided music box that will play a tune by clicking on either of the handles on the left and right sides of the box
You should hopefully notice a slight difference between the tune played from the left side from that of the right side Since we only have access to the sliding buttons that play the song on the left side of the box we must adjust the sliders here so that the two songs are identical Each note of the song is represented by one of the sliders The metal arm swings across the sliders sounding the notes of the song
The game randomly supplies the song to be played but never makes this task harder than having to exchange the horizontal location of two of the sliders Listen closely to the two songs to determine the two notes that are out of sequence and make the switch leaving the other sliders alone
Here are the three possible songs that can be encountered during gameplay with the incorrect slider positions noted in red The corrected songs are shown below
In order to have any note play earlier in the song move its slider closer to the left side of the box To have a note play later move the slider to the right Moving the slider to the left is accomplished by clicking on the metal arm itself while clicking at the right end of the slider groove moves the sliders to the right To locate each individual slider rsquo s hotspots make sure that the top of the hand cursor is even with the slider that you want to move Once you rsquo ve made the correct adjustments the right side of the music box opens revealing something taped to the bottom of the lid Click to see a close up view and take the metal ldquo piano rdquo key Bedroom Eye Fully back away from the music box and proceed past the table containing the box through the doorway straight ahead This room is a very bare artist rsquo s studio Wander around the room but don rsquo t be too disappointed when you don rsquo t find anything
Exit the studio and cross the music room to the other side At the doorway straight across from the studio turn to your right and use the piano key from your inventory on the keyboard cover of the piano to unlock it Click on the piece of paper resting on the piano keys The close up shows a picture of the Kerry House gardens with an Ascension Harp string lying on top of the primitive photograph Once the harp string is entered into the graphic back away from the picture turn back to the left and enter the doorway ahead of you
Walk one step into the bedroom and turn to your left Now walk two steps past the bed and fireplace and then turn to the right A small table with some curious shapes on it stands here Click to go forward towards the table Four pieces must be assembled into a four sided pyramid Use the following steps to properly assemble the shape if you get the pieces messed up just back away from the table and move forward again to restart Click on the closest block to you first placing it onto the table rsquo s central triangle Click on the next closest block to you to place it on the first then find the rotational cursor beside the block and click on it to rotate the block once Click on the left one of the two remaining blocks to place it on the pyramid Click on the last block to place it on the pyramid The newly formed pyramid will light up and spin and an image appears on the side facing you ndash the unmarked gravestone in the cemetery the one with the hotspot on it ndash obviously an important clue
Back away return to the room rsquo s doorway and enter the music room again Find the door to the stairs step forward and turn to your right and exit the music room Descend the stairs to the left or right and then turn towards the set of double doors facing away from the entrance to the house Walk forward through these doors Library Cards You rsquo ve entered the parlour of Kerry House ndash be sure to look around this room at the lovely paintings and furnishings From the entrance turn to your right and proceed through the doorway straight ahead You enter the dining room which contains some nice place settings but nothing to examine A door to your right takes you into a very bare kitchen again with very little to examine Re enter the dining room and walk back into the parlour
From the dining room doorway take two steps forward turn to your left and enter the library Walk forward to the room rsquo s desk and click on the papers on its surface One of four portions of a poem will appear in the close up view Keep backing away and clicking on the papers again to see the entire poem but it really isn rsquo t necessary to do this
Facing the desk turn to your right move forward turn to your left and click on the three stacks of cards on the table in front of you Click on each of the piles in order from left to right and watch the three card hand that is dealt to you Once your hand is dealt click all three piles again to deal another hand There are four different ladies who appear on the cards and the cards rsquo numbers always get larger from left to right In fact the left card is always a single digit from to the middle card is always a ldquo low value rdquo double digit number and the right card is always a higher double digit number
Back away from the cards and click on the framed picture hanging on the wall above the card table The picture covers up a combination safe ndash click on the safe to get a close up view The safe requires a three digit number combination to open You can change the number showing by clicking on any of the three red knobs Once the right combination is entered click on the wheel below to open the safe
Fourth in a Series If you rsquo re guessing that the combination is somehow related to the cards you rsquo ve at least got that right With any of the three card hands dealt a fourth card in the series if there was one would probably be a three digit number ndash a perfect combination for the safe
Of course the developers should have really supplied a better hint than this for players to solve the puzzle ndash perhaps an empty spot for where the fourth card should have been
Now we have to figure out the series of numbers in order to calculate what should come next Let rsquo s take the series for example In order to get from to you must multiply the by and then add in other words x In order to get from to you again must multiply the by and then add in other words x To get the value of the fourth card just repeat the pattern x
If the cards are showing below you would then back away click on the picture to uncover the safe click for a closer view and punch in as the combination followed by a click of the wheel Here are the other possible fourth card values First Card Second Card Third Card Fourth Card amp Safe Combination Slider Spoils Once the safe door is open a box with a dreaded slider puzzle built into its top awaits you It isn rsquo t a particularly tough slider to solve but for those out there who will be at their wits end here rsquo s a quick move solution to the slider
moves click on the tile corresponding to the number shown at left ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash ndash When the box opens pick up the scroll lying inside the box and read its message The passage mentions something about creating a cloudless mixture to turns metals into gold Back away from the scroll and click on the book that is left in the box If you have obtained Bernadette rsquo s Diary Key the book will automatically be accessible to you
The diary entries span a six month period during the latter half of when the ldquo Children of Kerry rdquo tried to make a go of it on the island The diary chronicles the love between Bernadette and her betrothed Dominic and how Dominic rsquo s obsession with the mysteries of the island lead to the group rsquo s downfall Although a lot of the material is superfluous to the story it rsquo s a light read and helps to fill in some of the story rsquo s plot which has been somewhat lacking to this point
Two important items to note Franklin Dominic rsquo s rival for Bernadette rsquo s love is buried in the cemetery ndash in fact his gravestone is one of the ones we were able to read and One of the gears from the windmill rsquo s organ power system is missing stolen from Franklin so don rsquo t worry that we haven rsquo t been able to get the organ working yet
Both of these text items are available in your book collection so you can refer to them again if you wish to
Greekhouse Back away from the open safe turn around and move forward to the door Reenter the parlour turn to your left and walk through the door straight ahead into the greenhouse Walk forwards until you rsquo ve reached some sort of mixing equipment at the far end of the room Examine the posters on either side of the mixer by clicking on them The one to the left simply tells us to ldquo harmonize liquids rdquo while the one on the right gives us a number of planetary symbols and their corresponding metals This seems to be what the scroll from the safe was referring to
There are three cloudy beakers along the base of the mixer and five liquid dispensers hanging above At any given time three of the dispensers are situated above the three cloudy beakers The dispensers are labelled with Greek letters including a alpha b beta g gamma d delta andc chi
The two arrow buttons along the top of the mixer rotate the dispensers to the left or right and the three round buttons place a drop of liquid into the left middle or right beakers from whatever dispenser is above it at the time
I can find no hints at all in the game that point you to the proper solution to this puzzle feel free to e mail me at the above address if you find one The only solution I was able to come up with was lifted from the only other walkthrough available on the internet place drops of alpha a liquid in the left beaker drop of alpha a liquid in the middle beaker and drops of alpha a liquid in the right beaker A golden key should precipitate itself into the centre beaker which should be placed into your inventory
If by chance you rsquo ve fiddled with this apparatus on your own already and this solution doesn rsquo t work for you my advice is to start adding alpha a liquid to each beaker one at a time left then middle then right then repeat until the key appears This worked for me If all else fails go back to a saved game where you haven rsquo t yet fiddled with the apparatus and the original solution should work
Month to Month Turn around and walk forward until you rsquo ve re entered the parlour Walk forward a step turn to your left and walk forward two steps through the French doors and out to the Kerry House gardens Move forward past the large circular equipment to your left towards the small building ahead and then click on the sign to the right of the small building rsquo s entrance The sign reads ldquo By this month rsquo s zodiac and sign align the planets all in a line rdquo
Click to move into the small building and find yourself staring at a busy set of ropes dials and weights
There is a set of cylindrical weights with small planetary symbols above them hanging from the top of the apparatus Pressing on the symbols along the top and on the symbols through the centre of the apparatus moves these weights up or down The planetary symbol for each weight can be horizontally aligned with any of numbers along the left side of the apparatus
In addition there are two horizontally rotating dials in the centre of the apparatus with each dial rotated using corresponding buttons to the left or right of the dial The top dial always shows two upper case letters at all times and the lower dial shows any one of twelve zodiac symbols
Taking the sign as a literal clue what month is it right now in the game We rsquo ve encountered no information anywhere that would place our journey to the island in a particular time or date In fact we rsquo ve received no information about ourselves at all ndash the faceless timeless explorer So if we rsquo ve got no set day or time we have no solution to the puzzle
Except that there is one date that is applicable ndash whatever date you the player are playing the game In fact the game very cleverly consults with your computer to determine today rsquo s date So if you are sitting in a humid cottage near Kingston Ontario in late July like I am you take the following steps to determine the proper placement of the dials and weights Figure out today rsquo s date when on vacation that can be harder than it sounds o July th ndash so July the seventh month of the year is my month Use the following zodiac chart to determine which sign is applicable to you o July thplaces me within Leo rsquo s date range Zodiac Sign Date Range Capricorn December to January Aquarius January to February Pisces February to March Aries March to April Taurus April to May Gemini May to June Cancer June to July Leo July to August Virgo August to September Libra September to October Scorpio October to November Sagittarius November to December Consult the book filled with zodiac planet Greek information flip to one of the pages at the back where the zodiac symbols are illustrated and find your symbol
o The Leo symbol is a shaped like a little sperm with its head to the left
Set the top dial by displaying the first initials of the two months that your zodiac symbol spans
o Leo spans July and August so I rotate the top dial until ldquo J A rdquo is visible
Set the bottom dial by displaying the proper zodiac symbol
o I rotate the bottom dial until the Leo symbol appears
Lower the weights so that the planetary symbol on top of each weight lines up with the number of your current month over to the left
o I lower all eight weights so that the round symbols at the top align with the roman numeral XII or corresponding to July the thmonth
Key Moments Once the correct settings have been entered pull the switch to the right of the apparatus You will see the large garden decoration visible to your right rotate around in some fashion Click forward to exit the small building turn around walk one step closer to Kerry House and turn to the right The garden decoration has aligned itself with the Sagittarius symbol Find the new hotspot located just in front of the Sagittarius symbol here A close up view allows you to see a key that has been placed on the concrete edge Pick up the key and back away
Turn to the right and walk forward a few steps past the small building to a door in the back garden wall There are twelve keyholes in the centre of the door one for each zodiac symbol Find the one that you used to solve the preceding puzzle for example for me it would be Leo and insert the ldquo Zodiac rdquo key the one you just grabbed into that symbol rsquo s keyhole The centre of the door morphs and reveals a hidden portion of the Book of Ascension
Once you rsquo ve grabbed the book grab the ldquo Golden rdquo key from your inventory and click on the main keyhole situated beside the doorknob on the left side of the door The door opens to reveal a path through some well placed stones Move forward through the passageway until it stops and turn to the right A glowing light beckons you forward ndash click on it
Across Space and Time You suddenly find yourself staring across a short walkway towards more green hills Turn around ndash it appears that you are on a promontory of land next to a short round building of some kind From your initial position turn to the right to face the doorway into the building Click on the door once to jiggle it twice to jostle it and a third time to rattle a key loose Hit the ldquo down rdquo arrow to look down at the ground in front of the door
Click on the key found here to gain access to the building
There are several maps on the walls in here but noting that can really be examined Turn to your right approach the desk here and click forward once more to view the map on the desk The map appears to chart the island and some notations made in German including ldquo Amulett rdquo Clearly the Germans must have had some sort of installation on the island during the Second World War remember the gravestone in the cemetery
Back away from the map and then the desk turn to your right and exit the building
Once outside turn to your right and move forward a step Turn again to your right and click on the building rsquo s small window ndash this allows you a peek into the building Back away turn back to your left and move forward Keep moving forward until you arrive at the tall tower in the distance

click on the chime you want to move and again where you want to move it to
The object here is to order the chimes based on the written message and the symbols Look to the message for a clue as to which symbol should be first ldquo Dusk rdquo is probably best represented by the symbol with a bit of white to the left the day and a lot of black to the right the night The rest of the chimes should be placed to form some symmetry across the entire wind chime as opposed to matching what the message says Yes this is a lame explanation Try the following After the chimes sway and ring a hidden compartment opens revealing a ldquo Sacred Key rdquo and a harp string for the Ascension Harp Pick up both objects back away turn to the left and exit the gazebo Walk back across the bridge take one step forward beyond the end of the bridge and turn to your left

Turn to your left to see a large plate mounted on a circular track atop a pedestal Move forward past the pedestal and then click on the plate from behind You now can control the position of the plate with the mouse The object here is to set it so that it is reflecting light from another plate located just to the left of the tower you see in the distance When the plate is positioned correctly you will see a shimmering light from the other plate in the distance Once the distant light is shimmering click the mouse to lock the plate into that position
Click back to return to the view facing the front of the plate and pedestal You should see an image reflected in the plate ndash it rsquo s actually a mirror Turn around two clicks to the left or right to see a third mirror reflecting the light Click towards this third mirror ndash the light is being directed at something in the distance Keep moving forward and click on the small wooden structure with the hanging items when you get closer These hanging items are Viking runes ndash click on the three bathed in light to place them in your inventory the other two remain there

This isn rsquo t a really difficult puzzle since you only need to pour one of the bottles onto the old flower and two of them have ldquo flower quot written on their labels Pick up the Experiment Flower Petal bottle it rsquo s the second one standing up from the left and click on the flower to bring it back to life The vial is placed into your inventory

Back away from the paper and click on the tube located to its right This is a kaleidoscope that shows some recognizable images ndash a swan the harp etc

Star Power Turn around and click on the stairs and the hole above to go up to the next level There isn rsquo t anything on this floor so click on the stairs again
The view up into the next floor is a little different ndash note the lever located to the right of the hole leading upward Click on the lever and then on the hole to go to the next floor
You face a telescope located in the centre of a domed room Currently the dome is closed ndash the inner ceiling surface seems to be covered in constellations and other star chartings Walk forward to the telescope and click on the dial located on the telescope rsquo s lower support The compass reading should display something around degrees in the centre of the reading window Click on the knob to the right to advance the reading to degrees as per the paper downstairs The should appear at the very centre of the window ndash if you rsquo ve gone too far move the reading back by right clicking the mouse
Back away and click on the small box on one of the support arms for the telescope this is up and to the left of the dial The box should read around degrees or so Click the box until degrees is showing as per the paper downstairs Again right click if you rsquo ve gone too far Back away again and click on the eyepiece located on the side of the telescope not the one at the bottom end A shining rotating star should be in the centre of the view ndash click on it to receive another piece of the Ascension Amulet
Back away from the view and from the telescope and then turn to the right Click on the small piece of equipment here The close up view shows that it rsquo s a control panel for the dome The lever to the right doesn rsquo t seem to work so try turning the compass direction by clicking on the knob to the left There really isn rsquo t any way to solve this except for trial and error but the dome won rsquo t open until the reading is close to degrees an important point for later Once is showing pull the lever to the right and listen to the dome open behind you
Back away from the panel and click on the lower eyepiece of the telescope at the bottom end We see a short movie of an eagle flying through the air and landing on a round structure along the side of a stone walkway Back away from the lens and the telescope and then click forward to move towards the opening of the dome Click on the opening to walk outside and turn to your left Move forward up the short ladder to the weather vane which has a familiar shape to it Click on the Ascension Harp to place it into your treasure graphic
Back away from the vane turn to your left and move forward to reenter the dome Walk forward one step and then click on the hole on the floor to descend the ladder Make your way to the ground floor of the tower and click on the wooden door behind the stairs to exit out the other side of the tower building
Stone Free Walk forward ndash you should recognize the stone walkway stretching out in front of you from the movie of the eagle Remember that it landed on a circular platform on the water side of the wall Walk forward onto the walkway take one step forward and turn to your right The eagle rsquo s nest is right in front of you complete with a harp string in its centre Pick up the harp string turn back to the left and continue moving forward along the stone walkway
The walkway eventually ends but continue moving forward across the green hills ndash someone has conveniently placed marker stones to the left and right to guide your way Eventually you rsquo ll spot several rounded stone structures in the distance off to the right a bit Walk forward until you cannot see the structures any more and then turn to the right A stone dwelling should be present straight ahead Walk forward and enter the building
Before you are stone heads arranged in a circular pattern Click on the boxy stone item in the upper left corner of the screen a ldquo capstone rdquo and then click on the scrolled paper in the upper right corner of the screen The paper contains a diagram of one of the heads and a circular pattern with six straight lines crossing it Back away from the paper and click on the heads for a closer look
The heads are numbered through and clicking on the ldquo rdquo head in the centre resets the heads to their original positions The only heads that can be moved are the inner odd numbered ones Each of the six heads can be moved one half position clockwise or counter clockwise The heads are moved by first clicking on the head and then clicking in whichever direction you want to move it
The trick here is to align the inner heads with the ones along the outside circle thereby recreating the pattern shown on the scrolled paper The only problem is that only some of the heads can be moved at any given time and only some sequences of moves will provide a correct solution You can either tinker with this puzzle until you get it right there are several solutions or use the following solution Move Head counter clockwise Move Head counterclockwise Move Head counterclockwise Move Head counterclockwise Move Head counterclockwise Move Head counterclockwise Once the correct pattern is formed the centre head disappears Click on the spot where the head was and get a close up view of a pile of ashes Take out the vial of flower power and click on the ashes ndash the liquid reforms the ashes back into a part of the Book of Ascension Read the passage and then back away from the close up view There are now two Viking runes lying on a small plate in the centre of the stone heads Pick up the runes and back away out of the building

You have runes in your possession The marks should indicate the value of each rune but if you are unsure toss it into one of the slots and count how many ticks the needle moves The runes have values of and But how to distribute them into the slot machine
The solution is pretty obscure so I rsquo ll walk you through it Remember the last time we wanted to open something up The dome in the tower How did we do it Set the controls to degrees What else do we know about degrees From the paper on the second floor of the tower degrees represents the ldquo south wall rdquo and December st the Winter Solstice How can we use this information Set the outside dial to ldquo rdquo i e
the thmonth and the inner dial to ldquo rdquo the stday Oh boy
Divide the runes into two piles ndash the first should have a total value of how about the and the
and the second should have a total value to the and Place the and the into the left slot and then the other three runes into the right slot The gate will open allowing you beyond
Walk forward through the gate and forward several steps until you spot a piece of the Book of Ascension on the rocks ahead I guess they ran out of puzzles Pick up the book read the passage and continue forward until the passage ends Turn to the right and step into the light

The Chosen Well of Souls A player rsquo s aide and support
From the pen ofDerWalrus This game has a lot of variables to juggle and you can end up not being able to afford to fix your equipment or buy healing if you make poor decisions
On the other hand you can become a Juggernaut
I am going to relate what I have learned after having re started the game three times
I have been learning as I go
Perhaps you will be able to prophet from my adventures
I will write of playing an Archer
First and foremost Skill Points are hard come by and you need to really specialize to succeed
Put SkP into your class
This would be Dexterity for an Archer
The exception is to put SkP into Strength early on to raise it to
This requires Level Ups
This lets you use decent armor
Demons A most important matter
You will be able to summon Demons after you advance into the game
You can get perks to Demons in the form of equipment that has the ability to make summoning easier or to make the Demon hang around longer Most everything cost a bunch of money except Demons Important Hang onto all items that have Demon qualities I will relate how to use them as we go along
Helpers This is a Golem and a Neferkar
The Golem is a slow melee type with lots of Hit Points and the Neferkar is ranged speedy and not real tough I chose to develop the Golem into a tank
Helpers level up and you can put points in their Strength and Vitality
I choose to put Golems points in Vitality mostly
This gives him more Hit Points and you more time to shoot foes
Golem He gets Experience Points by hitting and killing foes You also get XP from his kills
To develop Golem you must have him killing things
A good way is to put him where he is being attacked and attacking while you shoot his attackers to almost dead
Let Golem do the killing You want him tough as Helpers require a gold scroll to regenerate if they die and they will
My thought is to have him attract most of the attackers while the Archer peppers them with arrows
I think that having him live longer is more important than the damage he does
By summoning Golem you can have him appear right by you
He can also be banished
This is like ldquo storing rdquo him for future use
When you summon him he will have the same Hit Points as when you Banished him
Since he is a slow mover I generally ldquo store rdquo him when I am traveling and Summon him when he is needed
Your Weapon Keep in mind that the more expensive your weapon is the more costly it is to repair
Important It takes about five Level Ups to qualify for the next tier of weapons
The damage starts out in the to range and goes up or per tier
It also has Durability which rates how long it can be used before needing Repair Repair seems to be in proportion to the worth of the weapon
A weapon may also have other Attributes such as improved healing more Spell Points or Demon Summoning help
There are more Attributes
These all raise the worth of the weapon and thus the cost to Repair
You will be changing Weapons as the game goes on and these attributes may be lost
They also can be transferred to your new weapon see Cauldron and can be hugely expensive The moral here is to keep your Weapon SIMPLE
Your Worn Gear This is Armor and Headpiece This does not have to be changed as does your weapon
Thus it is a good place to put your Demon enhancing Attributes
Plus there is a Skill you can learn that reduces wear and tear on ldquo worn items rdquo NOT weapons
Thus they will need Repair less often Likely the worn items will also be cheaper to repair when needed It is also practical to use the Cauldron to Repair them
The Cauldron Here you can combine equipment for a price
It lets you see exactly what you are getting and the cost before you finalize the operation
You can cancel or choose other items
Nice Keep in mind that the worth of an item is going to go up when it is improved and Repair will be more Adding a Weapon to a Weapon increases the damage and reduces the Durability
Have a caution here
Potions reduce the cost you can sell a potion for gold but it will save you more when used in the Cauldron A spell reduces the Requirement of the item but costs about gold per reduction
Expensive
Armor increases the Durability Perks such as Demon Activity do not stack only the highest level perk will remain after using the Cauldron
There is a lot of give and take in the Cauldron and the Game is well balanced here in fact it is well balanced everywhere
Learned Skills Here are some suggestions
Offensive Convert Really works well take all you can get
This is the only Offensive spell I really like
Defensive Tend This is needed to heal your Allies not Helpers like Golem
See Allies
Stamina Well Keeps your hero from getting tired as quickly
Other Skills Virtue of Care Worn items deteriorate more slowly
There are some other ones in this category that look very interesting but I have not yet tried them
Skills Skills may be in use at a time
Demons Using them
You spend ldquo Faith rdquo to summon a Demon
Faith regenerates over time
It will be minutes or so to regen when you start summoning
The Demon will only stay a few seconds at first
As you add Demon perks to your equipment this will improve
Soon you can summon quite quickly
The Demon costs no Gold and in this game that is important
The Demons are strong
You can have a Demon and Golem running at the same time
This is why it is important to use the Cauldron to modify equipment to have Demon perks
What to keep and use If you are not a Magic user you should not use the Cauldron to add Spell related perks or Mana
It only makes the equipment more expensive to make and Repair
I try to use only things that affect your character
Just think out what you are doing and look at the results before you finalize a Cauldron creation
Also do not equip items that have attributes that you do not need it just makes them more expensive to repair
Keep and use items with Demon perks
Allies From time to time volunteers will join you
They are strong and do heavy damage
At times you may have as many as ten
They take damage and must be healed
To heal them use ldquo Tend rdquo As you take more levels of Tend they heal quicker and the greater distance you can be from them while they are healing
A level Tend works slowly and if you don rsquo t mind a little rest it is fine
Level works quicker but in as much as Allies are not present in ninety percent of the game that point might be better spent elsewhere
Magic running Your hero will glow purple when magic is running
If Tend is running the hero and the Allies being healed will glow
Your weapon will glow when it is producing some magic or skill related action
Fighting Learn to dodge missiles and spells
It is easy
Just run to the side when you see a spell headed your way The Spacebar is your friend

Keep your weapon simple and cheap to repair

Use Demon perks on Worn Items

Avoid using or ldquo Cauldronating rdquo items with perks you do not need

Develop one of your Helpers

Use SkPs only in the skills you need

Read the game manual carefully

Introduction The opening scene actually takes place in Venice somewhat later
Three sinister people wearing masks discuss ldquo Omega rdquo who is giving them trouble
They reach a decision that doesn rsquo t sound good for Omega
A man sitting in his office hands a pocket watch to another man who appears to be a gondolier
After delivering the pocket watch to Sylvie the gondolier is killed with a poison dart
This event will occur again later in the game
Brittany You automatically engage in conversation with Mr Guillaume the director of the Maritime Museum
He is happy to have you here
You are replacing Marcel who died from falling off a cliff
He managed to open a chest but closed it before he died
Somewhere there is a report
The chest belonged to Ponce de Leon the discoverer of Florida years ago
The chest was traced from Spain to Italy where it disappeared
It showed up in England at an auction
The only other people here are Claire the restorer and Antoine the janitor
You are here only for a quick look because you must give a lecture in Venice to promote your book
After Guillaume leaves go through the arch on the left into Marcel rsquo s workshop
Zoom in on the chest with the three dials
Try to open the lid but it is locked
You can try to move the hands on the dials a few times but you realize that you need the combination
Go back out of the workshop and zoom in on the D printer beside the arch
Judging from all the red lights the machine seems to be stalled in doing something
Go through the door on the right and down into the exhibition hall
Talk to Director Guillaume
He doesn rsquo t know the chest combination and he advises you to find Marcel rsquo s notes
He isn rsquo t helpful with the D printer either
Go back and talk to Claire
Feeling threatened by you she is a little snippy but she soon warms up
Claire reveals that she and Marcel were an item
Marcel had trouble opening the chest
He called someone in Paris who should know but that man soon died of heart failure
She talks as though that death and Marcel rsquo s were just bad luck but there is a note of skepticism in her words
Marcel recorded his notes on a dictaphone that you need to find
Go back upstairs to the office and zoom in on Marcel rsquo s desk drawer at the back
Open the drawer and take thedictaphoneand thetweezers
Take a close look at the dictaphone right click it in inventory and see that there is no memory card inside
Go back to the exhibition hall and talk to Claire about the missing memory card
She has it and gives thememory cardto you
Go back up to the office and in inventory insert the memory card into the dictaphone
You hear Marcel say that he opened the chest and he gives clues to the combination gale Jupiter and Claire knows the last number
You can replay the message by right clicking the dictaphone and pressing the play button
You need to ask Claire for the last number
Go back downstairs but Claire isn rsquo t there
Exit down screen to the outside where you find her standing by a well
Claire is a little quirky but in going off on a tangent she speaks of March ldquo our day rdquo You decide that must be the third digit
Return to the exhibition hall and zoom in on the ceiling vault
Look at it and see that Jupiter is represented as the th planet from the sun
The second digit must be
Go up to the office and zoom in the bulletin board beside the armored man
The drawing at the bottom right is that of a fragment of a jug just like what you saw in the D printer
Look at the ocean pictures
The one in the center shows a gale which is in the Beaufort scale
Now you have the three digits of the combination Gale Jupiter Claire Go into the workshop and set the hands left to right to and
The numbers must appear in the little windows of the hands
When you have unlocked the chest click the lid to open it
Take the th centurypistolwith a ramrod and thespanner key
Look at the paper lying left of the chest
It is Marcel rsquo s list of item that he found inside the chest
Note that the pistol and the ramrod are listed separately so enlarge the pistol and click theramrodto remove it
The only missing item is the ancient pottery fragment At the front of the chest right at the bottom is a keyhole
Use the key you took from the chest to unlock a hidden drawer
Unfortunately the drawer is blocked
Look at the left side of the chest and see a hole at the back bottom corner
Insert the ramrod into the hole to unblock the drawer
Open the drawer and take theold manuscript
Right click the manuscript to look at it in the large view
The left and right arrows along the sides of the frame allow you to flip through the pages
As you leaf through the manuscript you find map fragments sewn into the pages
Leave the large view and use the tweezers on the manuscript in inventory to remove the threads holding the map fragments
Display the manuscript in the large view again and click the first map fragment
That removes all of themap fragments and they now appear in inventory
Finally read through the now unobstructed manuscript for some background information about the Tree of Life
Note the reference to jug of seeds that was taken and to the many sea serpents
The next task is to assemble the map fragments
Right click them to see a large view
The fragments can be manipulated as follows
Left click and drag a fragment to slide it

With the cursor on a fragment right click will rotate it

With the cursor on the edge of a fragment the cursor becomes a circular arrow
Clicking will turn the fragment over to the other side
The fragments will stick together when they are properly placed
Which side of the map you decide to work is up to you
The following show the two completed sides
You note that the maps have no coordinates so you have no idea of the locations
You decide to copy the map
Exit the workshop out into the office
The photocopier on the right side has two problems the glass is dirty and the toner cartridge is empty
Nothing is ever easy
Take theempty toner cartridge
While you are at it check the D printer again to find more problems
Open the bottom center panel to find that resin is missing
Open the left panel to find anempty powder container
Open the right panel to see that a toner cartridge is missing
Go to the exhibition hall and approach Claire
Take theropefrom the side of the Viking ship
Back away and go to the toolbox on the table next to Claire
When you try to open the toolbox you decide that you need to ask Claire for permission
Talk to her to get her permission
When you tell her about the need for toner in the photocopier she suggests that you see Antoine
Go back to the toolbox open it and take thecloth thevarnish and thebrush
Talk to Director Guillaume and report the exciting news about opening the chest
As for the needed resin for the D printer he suggests Antoine
Exit down screen into the courtyard and go to the janitor rsquo s lodge the brown door that the vehicle is facing
Ring the bell and meet Antoine an apparent old salt of the sea with tales to tell
Eventually he gives thetonerto you
You explain why you need the resin for the D printer
Antoine goes inside to look for it
It appears that he is gone forever and ringing the bell again is not an option
You might as well pay a visit to the inn and the cliffs
Go through the arch and the door on the left
Make some small talk with the innkeeper and then return to the courtyard
Antoine is waiting for you and gives theresinto you
He has no powder for the D printer but he suggests that you use flour which he doesn rsquo t have
After some chat and tall tales return to the innkeeper
Ask him for some flour but first he needs you to get some water for him
If he is to be believed he uncovers Antoine rsquo s masquerade
Antoine is actually just a barber who got all his sea tales from his customers
There is considerable conflict between Antoine and the innkeeper
You are given abucketto fetch some water
Return to the courtyard and zoom in on the well
Push the grate aside and combine the rope with the bucket
Lower the bucket into the well and get a bucket of water
Go back to the inn and talk to the innkeeper to exchange the water forflour
Finish the conversation and return to the museum
Go upstairs and zoom in on the photocopier
Raise the top lid and clean the glass with the cloth
Open the front lid and insert the toner
Open the top lid and place the map on it
Close the lid and press the green copy button
Take themap copyand also open the top lid to retrieve the original Go to the exhibition hall and talk to the director to give the map to him
Talk to Claire
Report your success with the chest
Ask her about Marcel rsquo s appointment but she knows nothing about it
She gives a melodramatic account of their splitting up
Claire says there are letters in Marcel rsquo s secretary and gives you thekey
Finally you get her perspective on Antoine and the innkeeper
Return to the office and zoom in the secretary that is right of the desk
Use the key that Claire gave to you to open it
Take thedye containerfrom the second pigeonhole from the right
Read Marcel rsquo s notebook
He describes his conflicted relationship with Claire
You also know now about the mysterious appointment at the inn
It was with an ldquo antiquity lover rdquo who will want to buy the chest much to his disgust
Could this person have murdered Marcel
Zoom on the D printer and open the left panel
In inventory put the flour into the red empty container and place it into the slot
Open the right panel and insert the container with dye
Open the lower lid and insert the container with binder
Press the Print button open the front cover and take thejug fragment
Look at the fragment in the large view and see that it needs to be hardened
In inventory dip the brush into the varnish and paint the fragment
Start downstairs but you stop to overhear a phone conversation between Guillaume and someone unknown
Possibly the same person who contacted Marcel
Apparently this person is in Venice so Guillaume arranges for you to meet him while you are in Venice
Go downstairs and out to the courtyard
Continue on to the inn
Talk to the innkeeper about Marcel
He remembers Marcel coming to meet a man and that they left the inn together
After trying to patch up Antoine and the innkeeper you decide to look around the area
Zoom in on the fence in front of the inn and take thewirehanging there
from it
Zoom in the slanted fence rail going down the cliff and see a coin in the stone wall
Use the wire to dislodge thecoin
Look at the coin in the large view and examine both sides
Return to the museum and talk to the director about going to Venice
He tells you that a man named Saint Germaine wants to meet you there
Off you go to Venice
That creepy trio has taken notice of you
Venice You are at the lecture hall where you are to give your speech and you hold a long conversation with the lecture organizer
He wants you to look at the recess containing a marble tablet with a Latin inscription
The building used to belong to the Scuola a ldquo confraternity rdquo with origins in the Middle Ages
He gives some historical background
The chest you were working on used to be stored in this building
The chest was said to contain a map to the Fountain of Youth
He offers some theories on how the chest came to be here
It was moved to an unknown location during the Napoleonic Wars
You can go upstairs later
For now go to the desk at the left and take abook thepen thenailpolish thenail polish remover and theswab
Back away and look at the shredder on the floor right of the desk
Go through the arch into the meeting hall
Look at the two locked showcases along the back wall
Go to the niche and take the shortladderleaning against the wall
Look at the bottom part of the bas relief and then look at the upper part
It is too high to examine closely so place the ladder on the floor in front of the lower tablet
Now look up again for a better view
This is the old slider puzzle
The lower right square can be removed so do that to make room for sliding the other squares
You don rsquo t know what the inscription should be but you can be guided somewhat by the locations of the letters on the squares

A square whose letters are cut off at the top cannot go into the top row

A square whose letters are cut off at the bottom cannot go in the bottom row

A square whose letters are cut off at both the top and bottom go into the middle row
Once you have the inscription solved replace the blank square
Back off the ladder and note that the bases of the two columns can now be rotated
Clicking on a column base causes the inscription to rotate left or right
The goal is to get the grated side to face you
One solution is to click the left column twice and the right column four times
Zoom in on the grate and open it
Take thedry seedsthat must have been in the chest
Leave the niche and return to the meeting hall
Waiting for you there is a gondolier with a mask
He is a messenger from count Saint Germain
He hands achronometerto you and says that Saint Germain would like your opinion of it
Suddenly he is struck down by a poison dart from the creepy guy with green eyes
You are distraught and not just because your lecture had to be cancelled
In your talk with the somewhat cold hearted lecture organizer you get permission to use the tools and reagents from the showcases to examine the chronometer
However the meeting room is sealed with police tape
The organizer left his papers in there and can rsquo t get to them
The organizer is skeptical about your idea of temporarily removing the police tape
When you are done talking get a large view of the chronometer
Open it to see that there is an inscription on the inner lid but you can rsquo t read it without some work
Zoom in on the sealed door and use the nail polish remover to remove the tape
Go inside and to the front
Take theorganizer rsquo s documentsfrom a chair in the front row and pick up thegoldcoinfrom the floor
Check the display cases but they are locked
Return to the outer room hall and talk to the organizer
He is so pleased to get his documents that he gives you thekeysto the display cases
Return to the meeting hall and go to the display cases
Use the organizer rsquo s keys to open the one on the right
Take all of the tools thebrush thecloth thesilver cleaner substance thesilverpatinating substance thespatula and themagnifying glass
The keys will not open the display case on the left
Leave the meeting hall and use the nail polish on the police tape to put it back in place
You now have what you need to clean and read the chronometer
In inventory use a swab on the silver cleaner and then apply the swab to the chronometer
Look at the chronometer in the large view to see the result
The lid is clean now but it still can rsquo t be read
Back in inventory dip the brush in the silver patinating substance and apply it to the chronometer
Take another look a the chronometer in the large view
Back in inventory use the cloth on the chronometer
Use the magnifying glass on the chronometer and then look at the chronometer in the large view ldquo Benjamin S Briggs Mary Celeste rdquo Return the keys to the organizer and inform him that you have replaced the tape
You and the organizer discuss the mystery of the Mary Celeste and the chronometer that belonged to the ship rsquo s captain
Let him know about the seeds you found in the cache
He produces a list of the contents of the chest from the th century
The list is consistent with Marcel rsquo s list but it gives a better description of the jug with two spouts
The organizer thinks the jug turned up in Cairo
The organizer tells you that a man called for you
At the end of the conversation your phone rings and you finally hear from Count Saint Germain
He urgently wants you to restore a painted plank
He says that you can find him by referring to the chronometer
Come down screen leave the building and go to the square
Go to the trash container at the left and take anempty champagne bottleand some discardedpolice tape
Look in the toolbox and take thepliersand thescissors
Walk over to the couple and hold what has to be one of the most inane conversations in adventure game history
In the end you agree to give them an autographed copy of your book
You automatically go to see another masquerader on the bridge
Yikes
It rsquo s Creepy Green Eyes
Go near the steps into the lecture hall
In inventory put the book in the large view to open it
Then back in inventory use the pen to autograph the book
You can look at the book in large view again to see the inscription
Go talk to the couple again to give them the book
They give you a plasticmaskand aflare
Go up screen to the canal by the orange ish building
You futilely call for a taxi
There is an empty gondola that might have to be your transportation but you can rsquo t access it from here
Note that it is along the side of the lecture hall building
Perhaps you can get to the gondola from somewhere inside the building
There is another problem though
Even if you can get to the gondola Creepy Green Eyes is standing watch at the bridge
Eventually you will have to deal with that
For now return to the lecture hall and enter
You recall making smoke bombs out of table tennis balls which suggests that a smoke bomb is your solution to getting rid of Creepy Green Eyes
The next steps are a bit of a stretch but they are logical
Your flare is the closest you have to a smoke bomb but if you light it it will simply go off like fireworks
Table tennis balls are plastic so if you could replace the contents of the flare with plastic you could turn it into a smoke bomb
The only plastic item you have is the mask
Zoom in on the shredder on the floor right of the table
Insert the plastic mask into the shredder open the side panel and retrieve theplastic pieces Now use the scissors on the flare to cut the top open and empty it
Look at the result in the large view
Finally back in inventory place the plastic strips into the flare
Again look at the result in the large view
Now you have the ability to create a smoke screen but you still have to find a way to the gondola
Go up the stairs zoom in on the circular table and take thetablecloth
Also take thecurtain which includes a separate tie back
Notice the trapdoor at the back corner of the recess
It is fastened with nails so use the pliers to remove them
Try lifting the trapdoor but it is to heavy to hold open
However you did get a glance at a canal and the tip of the gondola
Clearly this is your access
Use the tie back on the trapdoor to hold it open
In inventory combine the tablecloth and the curtain
Tie the line to the trapdoor handle
This can be a little fussy so keep trying different spots
Go down the hatch to the ledge below
Go into the gondola and take thematches thebroken oar and thekey
The key opens the door in case you need to go back into the building
Go back up to the ledge and take the vertical stick that is along the front edge
Combine the stick with the broken oar and then bind them with the police tape
Now you are ready to go
Step back into the gondola
Place the flare in the empty champagne bottle and then place the bottle in the ring of the gondola
Light the flare with the matches
Green Eyes gets smoke bombed and you are able to slip by
Somehow you found the home of Count Saint Germain
Move back to the grated bars and see a dial mechanism for raising the grate
He told you that the chronometer would tell you what to do
The inscription included ldquo rdquo Because there are four number dials it stands to reason that is the combination
Pull the handles to increment the dials until you have
The grate tries to rise but it is blocked
Look up and see a wedged stone
Use the oar to dislodge it
Look around the Count rsquo s gardens
Zoom in on the pool and take thewatering canand thegreenbowl
Use the watering can on the pool to fill it
Also take the gardening gloves from the grass below the tree to the left of the pool Go left to meet Saint Germain
He is agitated about the death of the messenger and about the serious harassment he is getting
You return the chronometer to him
The Count is fully versed on Briggs
He outlines his theories on the disappearance of the crew from the Mary Celeste
He is certain that Briggs had the chronometer with him on the voyage
The Count tells of a plane accident in which he developed some amnesia
This is why he can rsquo t remember how he obtained the chronometer
He wants you to remove the paint from an old plank with the hope of finding a sign or an inscription underneath
Zoom in on the table at the back wall
Use the spatula on the cracked paint to uncover some letters
Zoom in on the shelf beneath the table and take thelye thepolyvinyl acetate and thescrub brush
Back at the plank dip the brush the small brush not the scrub brush in the polyvinyl acetate and then spread it over the exposed letters to protect them
Use the gloves on the scrub brush to protect your hand and then pour some lye into the bowl
Dip the scrub brush into the bowl of lye and scrub the plank
Now rinse the plank with the watering can full of water to clean away the old paint
Now you can easily see what was under the old paint but use the spatula to peel away the polyvinyl acetate
You conclude that the plank must have come from the lifeboat of the Mary Celeste
Talk to Saint Germain again
He got the plank from an antiquary in Cairo
He is evasive about why he is so interested in the Mary Celeste
He confirms that the chest was at the Scuola and believes that it was brought to this place
From here his theory goes Briggs got hold of it
The evidence suggest that Briggs survived the Mary Celeste but why didn rsquo t he return to his family
The Count thinks he might have been harassed and persecuted and had to go into hiding
You tell the Count that you found Ponce de Leon rsquo s manuscript in the chest
He wants to hire you as his expert in solving the mystery of the Mary Celeste
You drive a hard bargain but he eventually agrees
Over your protests the Count wants the chest
He insists that you stop working for the Museum and work only for him
The Count thinks the jug that was supposedly in the chest might be in Cairo
You tell the Count about solving the slider puzzle and about the seeds you found
He agrees to your trying the figure out the floor design
Zoom in under the balcony at the left
Take the four shards
Zoom in on the floor design then zoom again on the center to see that a fragment is missing
One of the shards you just picked up fills the hole
Back away once
Your objective is to turn the four circles into a proper arrangement
arrange a certain pattern on the relief
The circles are be moved by dragging them in either direction
The circles move in pairs
The finished product looks like this Moving all the circles counterclockwise one sequence is Circle times Circle once Circle times However I can rsquo t guarantee that the puzzle isn rsquo t randomized
Now zoom in on each of the four square tiles
Under each tile you will find seeds but in only once case are the seeds like those you found in the cache
They are under the upper tile
Take thoseseeds
Tell the count of your success
He feels there is a relationship between the tree pattern and the Mary Celeste
You tell him that you have seen the same tree on the two coins found near where the murders were committed
You have obviously spooked the Count
You tell him about the seeds you found and you wonder whether they are from the tree shown on the map
He wants to see the map
You don rsquo t have time to give the map to him though
Old Green Eyes is seen looking in the window
You run to the gondola and make your escape
Alpha Beta and Gamma are holding another meeting
You are now on their radar
Cairo Go up the short stairs to your room and look around
Slide back the screen and see a sink
Take thesoap theshaving brush as well as theclothes pinsandbasinthat are beneath the sink
Back away and zoom in on the mirror above the sink
Take it off and put the jug lip and the map copy into the recess
Replace the mirror and head back downstairs
Leave the hotel out to the street
Go farther down the street and arrive at the square
Go to the man who is standing under the ldquo Antiques rdquo sign
You ask about a collector but the antique dealer is too busy and will ask around later You make a deal with him to clean a soiledscarf
Leave the square through the large arch on the right
Zoom in at the area near the cart in the street and pick up thestringfrom the ground
Continue on to the hotel and chat with Ali
Go up to your room
Go to the sink and fill the metal basin with water
Add the soap and then place the scarf into the basin
Back away from the sink and got to the coatrack on the wall to the right
Place the string on the coatrack
Combine the clothes pins and the scarf and then hang the wet scarf on the string
Leave the hotel back out to the street
Go up the street and talk to the caf owner
Buried in a lot of small talk is your hope that he can tell you about the art collector
He explains his social networking and the word will be put out
Go farther up the street to the square and tell the antique dealer about your work on the scarf
The embroidered inscription suggests that a Saint Germain was one of the passengers on the Mary Celeste
There also appears to be an embroidered map but it is covered by an ink stain
The dealer managed to find the collector rsquo s servant and she is waiting at the caf
Return to the caf enter and chat with the owner
Go into the room at the back right and meet Fatima
Before she will talk she wants you to play a dice game with her
The rules are similar to twenty one and straightforward
By clicking lighting the dice you can choose the number of dice you want to roll
Your goal is to reach a total closer to than Fatima does
The scores are shown a the upper right corner of the screen
You will probably need to play several games before you win
Press ldquo New Game rdquo to begin
Fatima is evasive about the collector rsquo s name
As a child you used to eat coffee grounds with sugar sort of a clue
You explain that you are looking for the chipped jug that was in the chest
Saint Germain thinks it is in Cairo
You give the seeds to her so that she can compare them to the seeds in the jug
Fatima says the collector will consider meeting you and will send word through the antiquary
Take the leaning broom at the far right and go into the back room
Start by using the broom on the rug in front of the round table
This reveals something on the floor
Zoom in and with one click pick up twocandy wrappersalong with anothergold coin
Given what has happened before this can rsquo t be a good thing
A brief cut to a man with an eye patch shows why
Zoom in on the table in the back right corner
Take thecookiesand the two cups withcoffeegrounds
One cup has sweet grounds the other grounds are unknown
Recall how you used to eat sweet coffee grounds and dump the sweet grounds into a candy wrapper
Dump the other grounds into the other candy wrapper
When you leave the scene you replace the cups
Return to the caf for a final and unremarkable conversation with the owner
You still have to finish the scarf job so return to the hotel
Remove the dry scarf from the string
To get rid of the ink stain you need citric acid and milk
Go downstairs to see whether Ali has any
He doesn rsquo t but he suggests camel rsquo s milk from the bazaar at the town square
Go there and talk to the man at the fruit stand at the far left
Note also the lemon high in the tree
He won rsquo t milk the camel so you have to do it yourself
He lets you borrow apot
Go to the camel and try to use the pot on it
You decide to fill the trough with water to pacify the camel
Go to the well square and zoom in on the water well pump
You see a jumble of pipes and valves
If you open parallel to the pipe and close perpendicular to the pipe just the right combination of valves water will be directed to the trough
If you choose a wrong combination the fruit vendor or the antiquarian will complain
However even a wrong combination will retain any correct changes that you made Thus you need to have a good memory or a good set of notes
The most satisfying solution is your own trial and error attempts until you find the right combination
If you want a hint the water must flow from the lower left valve to the right end of the second highest pipe
Finally if you need the solution here it is
Credit guide gamespressure com Now go back to the tree on the left zoom in on the lemon and try to take it
It is too high
Talk to the fruit vendor and get awhip
Zoom in on the lemon again and try to use the whip on it
You still can rsquo t reach it
Talk to the fruit vendor again and he suggests climbing up on the camel to reach the lemon First you need to move the camel to the lemon tree
The intuitive idea is to lure him with your cookies but of course that doesn rsquo t work
If you were a camel what would you like
Why the sweet coffee grounds naturally
Try that and watch the camel follow you to the tree
Mount the camel and use the whip to get thelemon
Now you are ready to tackle the ink stain on the scarf
Go back to the hotel and enter the kitchenette
Take thepotfrom the stove and theknifeand theglassright of the stove
Pour the milk into the pot and place the pot of milk it on the stove
Be patient and then take thewarm milk
Note How do you know to warm the milk
You don rsquo t but if you go up and try the cold milk on the scarf you say that it needs to be warm
I just saved you a trip
Head upstairs to your room
Zoom in on the end table directly in front of you and take theswabs You decide to copy the information from the scarf onto the map
Go downstairs to get a pencil from Ali He can rsquo t tell you anything about the collector yet
Finish the conversation and go back to your room
Zoom in on the mirror remove it and retrieve the copy of the map
Leave the mirror in inventory
Zoom in on the window and place the scarf on it
Now place the map over the scarf and try to copy the missing part with the pencil
Unfortunately there isn rsquo t enough light to shine through to the scarf
Place the mirror on the table beside the window
Now you can use the pencil to copy on the map
Remove the map and the scarf from the window and pick up the mirror
Go to the nook over the sink hide the map in it and replace the mirror
Exit the hotel and go to the square
Return the scarf to the antiques dealer
He plans to sell the scarf to the man who purchased a plank from him i e Saint Germain
Apparently he gave his name as Wunderman
The collector rsquo s messenger will meet you at an unknown place probably today
The dealer warns you of a bald man with an eye patch
Go back to your hotel room to find Fatima waiting for you
Her husband isn rsquo t dead
He has gone missing after receiving a document with a picture of the tree of life
She is handling his collection affairs
Fatima has the jug but she feels in danger because of it
For that reason she is reluctant to give it to you
You tell Fatima about the chest Saint Germain the murders and the coins
She is greatly concerned when you tell her about the coin you found in the caf
Fatima says the second map the one with the coordinates is in the hand of a descendant of Captain Briggs
The map is in Gibraltar
The only clue she has is to start at the cemetery
Ali calls to you to come downstairs for a message
The camel trader has something important for you
He also mentions a bald guy with an eye patch
He was here looking for you
Eeek
Go to the market square and talk with the camel trader and fruit vendor
You return his pot and his whip
When he asks for your name tell him the truth to avoid a hassle
He will give your lostpassportto you
If you don rsquo t give your real name you will have to ask the antiques dealer for his help
Return to the hotel and notice Baldy stalking you
Ali says that Fatima left
You give him the cookies and head upstairs to get some sleep
The Count rsquo s Yacht As the Yacht sails for Gibraltar the Creepy Trio continues its sinister plans
You are holding a lengthy conversation with the Count
You show the updated copy of the map to Saint Germain
He notices there are no coordinates so you tell him about Fatima rsquo s information about the coordinate map being in Gibraltar
After finding Fatima dead he took the jug with the missing spout
He feels safe on the yacht but he has a gun just in case
The count has some delusional theories about who the murderers might be
Note his comment about feeling years old and his visions of the murderers coming from some earlier century
Hmmm


The Count is tired and needs rest
He would like a cup of tea
After he enters his bedroom you start to have some serious misgivings about him and you conclude that you have to incapacitate him somehow
Take the Count rsquo scanethat is leaning on the wall behind you
Proceed right into the kitchen area
Take thethermos with teaand thecupthat are on the counter right of the microwave
In inventory pour the tea into the cup
Open the cupboard door directly in front of you and find somesleeping pills
In inventory put the sleeping pills in the cup of tea
Go left and open the door to the Count rsquo s bedroom
Place the cup of tea on the stand
Return to the kitchen zoom in on the drawer at the far left end of the counter open it and take thecan opener
Check the cupboard under the sink and take somecanned meat
Go back left and see a rectangular outline in the wall at the foot of the stairs
Open the compartment door and take therope thescrewdriver and theresin glue
Return to the kitchen and then out the glass doors on the right to the yacht rsquo s bridge
Examine the radio on the right
Use the radio to put out an alert to the police
To disable the radio use the screwdriver on the screws in the front panel
After you get the radio open pull some of thewires
Use the screwdriver again to replace the front panel
Head back to the Count rsquo s bedroom
You realize that you haven rsquo t found his gun and you suspect that it is in his bedroom
Open the door and call out to him
He is not asleep and he doesn rsquo t want to come out
To get him out of the bedroom you come up with the idea of changing the yacht rsquo s course
Go back to the bridge
In the bedroom look at the painting over the bed
Click it to reveal a safe whose combination you don rsquo t know Zoom in on the desk at the left and take thebrush thespatula and themagnifying glass all with one click
Open the desk drawer on the right and remove thepistol
Now you feel a little safer about confronting the Count
Go confront the Count on the bridge
He denies killing Fatima and gives his reasons for not informing the police
You outline your own thoughts about Saint Germain being the murderer
The Count relates how someone had tried to take his life and is still hunting him
Your version of the past events is refuted with some logic by the Count
Your distrust begins to break down and you release the gun to the Count
He promises to reveal his secrets in time
You decide to try affixing the model spout to the jug that the Count took from Fatima
Go back to the main room and zoom in on the jug resting on the coffee table
The jug needs to be cleaned first
Use the spatula and brush on the jug
Then put some resin glue along the broken edges
Place the spout on the jug
Use the wires you took from the radio to hold the spout in place
Pick up the repairedjug
The yacht moors at a pier in Gibralter
The police responding to your radio call are awaiting Saint Germain and lead him off to the police station Fatima advised you to start at the cemetery so you need to find it
Zoom in on the cannon and take themetal ringfrom the ground in front of the monument
Go to the street at the left edge of the screen
Standing at the intersection and looking up the street note that there is a ldquo wicket rdquo or gate on the right that can be approached
Do that and find that the gate is locked
Eventually you will be coming back here
Back away from the gate and continue up the street
There are a couple of locked doors you can try but for no purpose
Keep going up the street to the cemetery on the hill
You pass a woman leaving the cemetery
Zoom in on the bench open the toolbox and take thewire brush Go up the main path and keep looking at tombstones and cleaning them with the wire brush until you find one that belongs to Captain Briggs
His grave is under the palm tree
Note the candle that must have just been placed there by the red haired woman
Use the wire brush to clean the inscription but it is too dark to read
Pick up the candle and use it on the inscription
Sure enough this is the grave of Captain Briggs who died February
Note that he was born April
You ask if they know the red haired woman you saw at the cemetery
The customs officer thinks he knows the person you mean and he has a parcel for her
Go back to the yacht in search of the Count rsquo s medication
Try the kitchen cabinet on the right end but the medicine you need is not here
Go out the bridge to find themedicineon the counter in front of the radio
Go back into the kitchen and realize there is an intruder on board
WARNING You are about to enter into a timed sequence
You will find that the intruder Baldy Eye Patch is in the Count rsquo s bedroom
Your goal is to lock him inside
Your method will be to place the cane across the door and then tie it in place with the rope
Dummies like me would experience many frustrating failures without ever figuring that out especially since the rope must first be tied into a knot a not entirely straightforward process itself So decide what you want to do
Given the hint above you can see whether you can do those things in the time allotted
The game is automatically saved so you can reload and keep trying
If you succeed skip the next paragraph
Or you can use the next paragraph to solve the problem
Before you peek in the door to the Count rsquo s bedroom you can prepare a knot in the rope
Look at the rope in the large view
If you know what a bowline is you can probably tie it easily
Otherwise you are guided by the arrows
The blue arrow is to ldquo undo rdquo the previous action
The red arrows give you choices for tying the knot Click the top red arrow pointing right to move the loose end behind the standing line

Click the down read arrow to bring the loose end across the standing line and down

Click the remaining arrow to complete the knot
Now go to the Count rsquo s bedroom door and peek in to see the bad guy
Note that he tosses a coin on the desk never a good sign
When you can zoom in on the door
Place the cane and then the rope with the knot on the door handle
Go up the stairs and leave the yacht
Return to the police station and report Baldy Eye Patch
The customs officer won rsquo t give you the woman rsquo s address until they return
He warns you of a dog in her yard
Talk to Saint Germain
Your repentance has little effect
You relate your experience at the cemetery and you give the medicine to him
He says that he has money in the yacht safe
He tells of his vision of the Tree of Life on Bimini the tree that will restore his health
Saint Germain again alludes to the possibility that he has been there but he can rsquo t remember the circumstances except for the plane crash
You discuss the motives of the killers
Is Saint Germain their guide in getting them to Bimini first
The key now is to find the woman who probably has the coordinates map
Zoom in on the customs section and open the grated window
Zoom in on the parcel but it is too far away to reach
Back away and pick up thefishing rod
Zoom in on the parcel again and use the fishing rod to pull it to the window
Look at the parcel and see that it is addressed to Sarah Rivera at Victoria Square
The parcel is to be delivered at the Nelson Street entrance Leave the station and see Baldy Eye Patch being led away by the police
Look at the gate and see a vicious dog
This isn rsquo t the Nelson Street gate for the delivery anyway
Back away go to the Marina and then go up the side street on the left as you did for the cemetery
Go to the gate on the right
It is still locked but this time you can look under the rock on the ground right of the grate
Move the rock and take thekey
Use the key to unlock the gate enter and go to the inner gate
Now that vicious dog has come around to this side
You need to find a way to distract him
Return to the square and to the main gate
In inventory use the can opener on the canned meat
Note Save your gamehere because you are about to start another timed sequence
If you don rsquo t and you fail you will need to go back to the yacht and get another can of meat
Place the open can of meat inside the gate and RUN
Go to the square to the marina and up Nelson Street
Enter the gate and then enter the inner gate
Place the metal ring over the inner gate to keep the dog out
Knock on the door at the back and meet the quirky Sarah
She refers to Briggs as her curse and hints at her relationship to him
Sarah tells the story of her grandfather Jasper finding a dazed Briggs
Jasper restored Briggs to health
In gratitude Briggs gave him his chronometer
Briggs told Jasper about finding the Tree of Life but he warned that a ship shouldn rsquo t go into the Bermuda Triangle
Only an airship would do and Jasper proceeded to build one
Jasper found a map in Briggs rsquo rsquo s chest but then Briggs disappeared along with the chest
Go back to the square and enter the now open main gate
Sarah leads you into the hangar that holds an enormous airship built by Jasper and Sarah rsquo s father
The airship will fly but there is no helium
Talk with Sarah again
She wants no part of making the trip but she will sell the airship to the Count for a million dollars
Go back to the police station and Saint Germain about what has happened
The Count is anxious to buy the airship and tells you to get the money from his safe on the yacht
The combination to the safe is the month and year of Briggs rsquo birth backwards
Before you leave get an update from the police officer and customs official
The return to the yacht and the Count rsquo s bedroom
Take the gold coin from the desk
Then open the painting over the bed to reveal the safe
Recall that Briggs was born April i e
Backwards the combination is
Enter that combination and press the pound accept key to open the safe
Take themoneyand theblank checks Go to the hangar and see Sarah and the Count
Sarah explains that the airship need to be filled with hydrogen and that the coordinates are already on the console
You will need to enter the route you want to take and the computer will do the rest
The count pays Sarah the agreed upon amount
There is no hydrogen so you will have to produce it with the electrolysis machine inside
However the machine requires electricity and it has been cut off
Sarah hints that there is another way although it doesn rsquo t sound legal
Come down screen and take thecablethat is on top one of the crates
Go to the boxes on the left and take the cable
Connect one end of the cable to the box by the hangar and the other end to the box by the gate
Go inside the hangar
Zoom in on the area below the platform and left of the stairs
Take theoil container
Look inside the light brown cabinet and take theoil canand thegear
Zoom in on the crates at the far left side
Take thechainfrom the ground and thelinkin front of the tall crate on the left
Climb the stairs to the platform and zoom in on the green device mounted on the wall
Install the chain and then insert the link into the chain
Place the gear between the two existing gears
Try to turn the handle but there is too much friction In inventory fill the oil can with the oil container
Apply the oil to the device and try the handle again
Watch the ceiling doors open
Go back outside the hangar and talk to Sarah
She forgot about the valve which is what the waiting parcel is at the customs office
Now she has the money to pay for it and she gives some to you
Sarah also describes the weather map that shows wind currents and places to avoid
You need to sail the ship with the wind as much as possible to conserve fuel
Go back to the police station and talk with the customs man
You pay for and get theparcel You are to return in a half hour to sign the police report and you are not to leave without permission
You agree but somehow I don rsquo t see that happening
Put the parcel in the large view click it open it and you get the neededvalve
Go back to the hangar and out to the pump at the end of the platform
Insert the valve in pipe opening
Back away go to the generator and try the switch again
The airship fills with gas
Go back outside and talk to Sarah
After your goodbye you and the Count go inside the airship
Go to the console on the right and place the map on it
Turn the red switch to superimpose the coordinates on the map
Now click all the panels that are active
There are five of them
Go to the control panel at the center
There you see the wind directions indicated by the arrows along with the areas to avoid the island with the palm tree your destination and the circle along the right edge that indicates the starting point of the airship
You need to chart your course
To do this you need to use the four gold coins
Note I spent a lot of wasted time clicking way on the map all to no avail
I stumbled on to the gold coins completely by accident and desperation
I fail to see the connection except perhaps that your destination is the Tree of Life and the coins depict the Tree of Life You can play with charting the course or you can follow this solution Note As far as I can tell there is no way to reset the puzzle
If you make a mistake just keep clicking various arrows until you run out of maneuvers

Place the coins on the circle representing the airship
A series of dark arrows is shown Still holding the coins click the first arrow until it is facing northwest
Go up to the next to last arrow of the series and click it to face due west

Go to the next to last arrow of the series and click it to face northwest
Go to the next to last arrow of the series and click it face ldquo Perfect
The air route is ready rdquo Pull the red handle and off you go
Bimini Island You arrive over the island crater with the Tree of Life growing in it
Open the cabinet at the right and take therope ladder thebrush thespatulaand thecamp shovel Zoom in on the floor hatch and open it
You need to secure the airship so take theanchorthat you see along the left side of the hatch
The anchor has to be attached to the structure on the right side
Because the ship is swaying the arms of the structure come in and out of view
Pick up the anchor and hover in the general area
When the cursor becomes a bulls eye you can attach the anchor to the structure but you need to be quick
I found attaching it to the piece that sticks up in a northwest direction to be the easiest
Keep trying Connect the rope ladder to the hooks at the bottom edge of the hatch and descend
You are on a ledge with a torch
Talk to the Count who is euphoric Zoom in on the rock beside the torch and see signs carved into it
Take the upper path to the thicket
Looks in the shrubs and gather somebrush wood
Continue right and take someherbsand adry branch
Go back to the landing area
and try to cross the bridge
The birds are threatening so shoo them away with the dry branch
Now cross the bridge to the platform
Talk to the Count who tells you about making juice from the Tree of Life fruit
Go to the back right to the fork
Zoom in on the junk beside the hut on the left
Take therope thefruit basket and thetorch
Zoom in on the down center screen stone covered with sand
Use the shovel to remove the sand and then use the spatula and the brush on the stone you uncovered
Note the symbols on the rock
Go to the village rsquo s edge at the right
Zoom in on the crater wall at the right and take somemoss
Underneath is what appears to be a drawing of fruit
Return to the fork and continue on to the village at the left
Keep going left to a bridge and take thewind sleeve Use the lever to lower the bridge and cross over it
This brings you back to the thicket you have already seen
Keep going left back to the landing zone and take the bridge again to the platform where the Count is still standing around Zoom in on the stone left of the elevator basket and the carved symbols
Look at the elevator basket to see that it isn rsquo t working
The Count says it is activated in the village
Examine the three features of the vessel across from the Count
Note the lever right of the vertical shaft but you don rsquo t know what its use is yet
Go back down the ladder to the village
Zoom in on the panel at the lower left corner of the screen and see a lever on the left and two yellow buttons
The lever on the left is used to adjust the height of the windmill to one of three positions
The center yellow button turns the windmill clockwise and the right yellow button turns the windmill counterclockwise
Your task is to turn the windmill so that it is facing into the wind
As you recall the wind sleeve this means that the windmill should almost be facing you but a little to the left
A big complication is that at certain heights and directions the levers are blocked and no more adjustments can be made
My solution and there are surely many others is to begin with the windmill facing to the left due west and at its lowest position left lever all the way up
This is fairly easily accomplished
Now do the following
Press the right button twice

Lower the left lever once

Press the right button once
The windmill now facing into the wind and at the middle height starts turning
Back away from the panel and go up the ladder on the tall left structure
The lever on the right is used to control the elevator and the water flow
You can experiment to see which way to pull the lever to activate the elevator or you can use this hint
Pull the lever to the left
Go back down the ladder and go right to the fork
Follow the bridge in the lower left corner to the platform
Enter the elevator basket and take a ride up to the tree crown
Zoom in on the platform at the left the part that is jutting out and place the basket there
Place the moss in the basket to provide a soft bottom
Now you need to collect fruits to make the juice
The Count said that unripe and overripe fruits are used as well as ripe fruits so you need to pick everything you can find
Zoom in on the branches at this side of the platform
There are fruitsto pick here
Four are ripe two are overripe and one is unripe
Back away and zoom in on the branches at the right side of the platform
Here you can pick ripe fruits
Back away and zoom in on the lone fruit hanging out over the chasm
You can rsquo t reach it though
Just left of the branches is a ladder
Take it up to the next level
Zoom in on the branches at the far left side
There are two fruits here but you can rsquo t quite reach them
Use the dry branch on one of them and the fruitsfall harmlessly into the basket below
Zoom in on the bough at the right side of the tree
There is no fruit here but touch it reveals that it is a solid bough
Use the rope on the bough
Back away and take the ladder back down to the lower level
Zoom in again on that lonely fruit at the right that you couldn rsquo t reach
The rope you see is the one you just tied to the bough
Use it to swing out and grab thatone fruit
Go to the basket on the far left of the platform and retrieve the unripe fruitsfrom it
Check your inventory and see that you now have ripe fruits unripe fruits and overripe fruits
Go back to the elevator and take it down to the platform
Talk to Saint Germain to report your progress
Now the fruits must go into the vessel
Look at the vessel and place your repaired jug in the tree stump just left of the vessel
Zoom in on the top part of the vessel and try to place a fruit into one of the holes
It rsquo s not that easy
You need to know the ldquo recipe rdquo Talk with Saint Germain
He confirms that the fruits must be used in ldquo proportion rdquo but he doesn rsquo t remember the formula
He suggests that you talk to a native in the village
Show the coin to the native to get him to talk to you
Go to the fork at the back right and see the native sitting near the stone you uncovered
Talk to him and he launches into a sing song rendition of a poem
It was taught to him by Captain Briggs rsquo wife named Sarah
Click the coins on the native to get him to talk more
He tells you the rule The proportion of ripe to unripe fruits on one side is the same as the proportion of ripe to overripe fruits on the other side
He won rsquo t tell you which side is which
It sounds as though he is expecting Mrs Briggs to return
Return to the platform at the lower left and zoom in on the vessel again

On the left side put unripe fruits into the upper holes and ripe fruits into the lower holes

On the right side put ripe fruits into the upper holes and overripe fruits into the lower holes
To fill the top holes you are guided by the stone where the native was sitting
Suddenly two members of the Brotherhood appear and a startling story is told
They have been using the Tree of Life to attain immortality
You also learn more about Saint Germain
Eventually you are locked up in the prison hut
Talk with the Count who says that escaping is not enough
A weapon is needed
Clearly he intends to remain here even at his own peril He is certain that the two of you will be killed because there is too little potion to go around
You deliver a morality speech but the Count replies with his vision of a dark world in which all are immortal
He tells you about how he was here with Briggs and what happened to Sarah
Alpha and Beta were there too
Now talk to the native and ask him to free you
He seems relieved that Sarah is dead free from all of this
When he hears that you have four coins he realizes that the prophecy will come true and the tree will die
He is glad that the end has come and he frees you
Talk to the Count
He tells you to go the airship and get the gun
He will wait at the vessel
Click left and find that the bridge to the platform can rsquo t be used
Keep going left to the bridge that you lowered earlier
Or lower it if you haven rsquo t already
Cross the bridge and keep going left until you reach the landing zone
Climb the rope ladder to the airship
Go to the left bunk slide the pillow away and take thegun
Go back down the rope ladder and you give the gun to the Count
ldquo It rsquo s time to deal with them rdquo Go to the center screen and eavesdrop on the conversation between Alpha and Beta
Then the four of you engage in a debate and negotiation
Alpha knows how to set the rings so he is ready to make a deal with the Count
The Count thinks you can figure out the settings
The interplay of greed and survival reaches a high pitch
Eventually you agree to complete the process of making the potion
First you need water
Go to the fork at the back right head left and use the ladder on the left structure to climb the windmill Pull the lever to the right twice to start the water flow
Go back down to the village
You also need fire so cross the drawbridge on the left and return to the landing zone
You can rsquo t take the torch but you can light the one that you have
Come around to the left of the torch and zoom in on it
Use your unlit torch on the burning torch to get your ownburning torch
Go down the bridge on the right to the platform and zoom in on the vessel
You recite the Count rsquo s instructions
First you need a fire to heat the water so zoom in on the lower part filter
Place the brushwood underneath and use the burning torch to light it Note After completing certain tasks you will be distracted by further conversations in the group
When they are done just return to what you were doing
Now you need to adjust the steam
This is done by pressing the buttons of the filter but not randomly
You will fail if you try to press a button that is adjacent to the previous button pressed
The easiest way around this is to press the buttons alternately in the first and third columns and then in the second and fourth columns Finally you need to align the rings in the neck of the vessel
When you zoom in on those rings you see symbols similar to those on the three stones that you have encountered
If you haven rsquo t made good notes you can refer to the following Your task is turn the rings to display the right symbols between the two arrows
But which symbols The trick is to examine the three stones and determine which symbols are unique i e appear only once on the three stones
For example what looks like a gallows at the top of the stone on the left also appears on the stone at the right
That disqualifies that symbol

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
Chronomaster Walkthroughby Darksheer Notes Well though this game looks good its damn hard
And I mean HARD
You lucky guys now have thiswalkthrough but when you solve this game by yourself its top emotion
Also know that there is a plenty of methods to solve many of the riddles and I'll try to mention the places where Iknow the different way can be taken but I failed to figure it out
Every time you return to Jester if there is a message on the screen click on it to play a videomessage
Also note that some of my sentences are nonsense but they are put there to make it easier to find hotspots on screen And forgive me if my language isnt as good as you expect
OK
Lets begin
After a couple of videomessages on your display turn right and select universe planet in this universe and location and sublocation there
I will skip this instructions later in the walkthrough because its useless to describe and eats bytes on your HD
Select Urbs URBSAt main Urbs planet select location Sculpture Garden
Talk with the robot
This time you cant presuade to move his ass off the magnetic north but we'll do it later
Walk left or right and explore other screens at this location
Pick up a rock and crush it using a hammer from your Tools
While you explore read all the plaques on the sculp tures to get some tips
Return to Jester your ship
Select location as Ground Zero City
Pick up rag and crowbar at the landing site
Go to the north walkway
Use bottled time on citizen and then another bottled time on bomb quickly exit this screen and reenter it whoa the door is now unreachable
note than you can just pass the bomb by and not deal with it we'll get in there in more complex way
Return back to landing site and take eastern walkway
You enter a museum
Inside pry open the container with your crowbar
Pick up a shield from the container
Pick up a polisher from the floor use it on rag and use rag polisheron the shield
You will see display cases in this room but you need only general bars from one of them use polished shield to grab them
Return to the entrance to the museum and find a spot on the door where an arrow to the right appears go there use elevator to descend a level down talk with guard but dont make him angry and walk away
Return to Jester
Fly to the Fort
Pick up a uniform from the dead body
You may wear it
Use bottled time on a rocket launcher
Push button near it to move rocket up
Exit screen to the south and you will be on the battlefield
Take both flags
Return to Jester and fly to the garden
Wear uniform
Go to the statue with a flagpole and use enemy flag on flagpole one of flags will do if you pick up the wrong one you wont be able to trick robot
Go to the robot and command him to go join the battle if you did all correct he will go away
Use resonance tracer
Now fly back to the fort and there go to the battlefield
Here you should see a bridge with a scanner nearby
Wear uniform
Use general bars on Korda
Now you will be authorized to cross the bridge
Inside the fort you will see a firing squad use a shield on every squad member to vaporize them
Pick up a file in the corner and read it
Then talk to the prisoner
Here you can decide what approach to take but I chose one to believe his story and to let him go and well I wasnt killed though he escaped you may try another approach its fun to see 'what if'
Exit to the south of the screen
Here you will see a distant entrace into some private area protected by a code lock
Here you can either use PDA on keylock or use powdered rock on it to get fingerprints
Either way though I havent tested the onewith PDA you come in
Here after some cut scenes you are given a choice whether to save or destroy this universe
Though I am very peaceful dude Korda died when I chose to save it it may be triggered by something but I don't care much about it but I suggest to destroy it
Just after this one you are given a logical puzzle to gain the World Key if you succeed you are here on your own though even a braindead person will solve it in minutes
Just after this you withstand a Council Of Wise to choose your punishment I think the only non lethal approach is to choose 'Bluff' and then 'Respect' from response variants
You will be freed and now you can walk to Jester and takeoff Urbs
Aurans awaits AURANSFly to the location of the Magnetic North
Exit screen
Take a bottle it opens and djinni emerge talk with them and agree to feed them
When you will get to the new location pick up all the fruit and an animal carcass
Return to djinnivia the carpet
Give them fruit with following symbols pillar cross burning man bread star and lotus
Take a djinni bottle and a carpet
Return to Jester fly to the Canyon
Here walk carefully to avoid quicksands on your way rocks will fall into them andyou may pass
Exit screen to the bottom
Look at the beast
Return to Jester and fly to the Plateau
Exit screen to the northwest
Get all the rocks coins from the sand and talk toArabou The Trader
Exchange information with him and when you warn him about beast he gives you a flute
You also need to get sandals from him you may give him a bottled time a carpet or a djinni bottle
The most preferrable is bottled time because you have a lot of them and if you give him a djinni bottle then you should get it back from him in exchange to the Emerald Camel from Treasury
Now fly back to the Canyon and go into the cave to do this you need to stand near the last quicksand and use sandalson Korda
Then just come into the cave
You can try to take a blinking object within a skull if you want but as I think you can't get it without being bitten and losing your time
Also note that you get the needle only when you try taking it twice
But anyway this item is not essential
Cross the bridge
Go to another screen
There go to the southern exit
Here take a cooling feather take it twice because first time he'll drop it
Return to the Canyon and go to the lake
Use feather on lake and cross it after that
Go to the dead nomad
Take a turban and mosaic tiles
Return to Plateau and take a way to the left not to Arabou and you'll come to the lake with backwarding water
Use feather on lake and then pick up an ice particle from lake
OK now fly to Caverns location and enter cave there
Inside there are many ways to cross the web walkway use magic wand on web near you then take this enchanted web and use it on Korda you'll get to the exit doing this
this one is slow use wand on webs but just walk across them here you can take a short route but on your way you'll be bitten by spider and will loose time or take a long way which doesnt include crossing a place where thehole in the wall is
After this navigate a maze until you come to the underground lake
Try talking with a nomad but he'll vanish
Takea cloth which he had lost soak it in the lake
Go into the other cave not one you have come from and there use your ice lens on big crystal you make your lens bright
Use soaked cloth on the emblem on the wall and a door appears in the cave to the left
Go in there
Use your lens on the guy with the sword and pick up his sword
Talk to the cook and after you finish talking use yourfeather on the fire he gives you a canteen
Exit to the left
Use your sword to kill the spider talk to gypsy dancer and accept her challenge
Go to the northwest and use sword to kill the man there
Return to gypsy and you get her veil
Enchant it with your magic wand
Go to northwest and further to the north you'll come to the man with a telescope
Talk with him and lend a telescope from him for some coins
You can use screwdriver on the telescope use lens on the telescope and then use screwdriver on it again and use your 'fixed' telescope to look at the palace
Now you'd wish to get there there are two ways maybe more for example I suppose sandals can help you with this too use enchanted veil on Korda and then go to the palace or return back to the Plateau's lake with backwarding water fill a canteen from it and then go to the Canyon and to the place where you can go down to the screen where the feather was here is another path to the north and on thatscreen use canteen on Korda and walk to the palace
Note that the latter way means you need to leave Caverns to do this you need to take water from underground lake And as I recently was told there IS a way to get to caverns again because when you first go there rocks fall tobarricade exit it is Fix your turban with a needle enchant it with magic wand wear it and go to the place with a talking if you use wandon it sign near the place where you got the feather
Go to the right of that and talk with nomad and walk into thetwister
If you will need there to go into the caverns because you will be brought to nomad's camp then use a flute on the crack in the cave wall to crawl inside
And to go back to the camp just open the door
Anyway you get inside the palace here you can talk with charlatans who are trying to get easy money from tourists a poor woman wealthy oracle magician all of them are willing to get a ruby from the treasury but dont bother if you give it to them later they just tell you nonsense and thats all
Though you can buy a bowl from a poor woman
After the screen with a magician you will come into the room with a guard you can talk with him then give him yoursword and he'll let you in but there is a beast inside
Sorry can't provide you with info on how to get rid of the beast I have heard rumors that it is done with a bowl and some food poisoned
but we'll get to harem in a different way
Return to previous screen take a left walkway talk with a bathing man use bottled time on water then mosaic tiles on the water you'll complete a tile image
Return to the room with walkways take a right one talk to the guard enter treasury
Here you can take not more than items note that though you can take rd item you'll be whisked away from palace and will have to get there again
You can take a emerald camel it is a MUST if you gave a djinni bottle to Arabou go and change it for bottle b coins I dont see any sense in taking them either c ruby if you want to bring it to one of the charlatans at the palace entrance come and see by yourself
Now push the pedestal with ruby push the tapestry push the mattress where the emerald camel is standing and go into the hole
In harem there is only one girl which will talk to you chat with her and give her a djinni bottle as theanswer to her riddle I believe there is only one riddle in her database otherwise you are on your own
Immediately after that you are provided with a 'World Key' puzzle it is to compose an Aurans symbol from many pieces
If you cant seem to understand what does the picture look like restore your previous savegame and look for this symbol in the Caverns near underground lake

The City of Lost Children by Psygnosis Walkthrough by Jenny IntroductionThis is a step by step walkthrough including the keyboard commands you use to control the game
I wrote it because the only two other walkthroughs for this game that I found on the net were somewhat sketchy City of Lost Children is a keyboard controlled game
The arrow keys move your character around and the Escape key accesses the Main Menu for saving and loading games
The Escape key also skips cut scenes
The P key pauses the game which can be useful because some parts of the game are timed
Holding down the Control key along with the forward arrow key will make your character run
The Alt key will cause your character to crouch which can be useful for hiding behind things
The Page Up key will cause your character to pick something up or put it down
The Page Down key will cause your character to speak to another character
The Tab key will open inventory or cause your character to stow an item she's holding in inventory
The Enter key will cause your character to interact with something or take some action
The keys themselves aren't that complicated but it can be difficult to orient your character into the proper position to make them active
So it's easy to miss things like inventory items
The camera that appears in the upper right of the screen doesn't indicate an action can be made
It only indicates that you can shift to a different camera angle by hitting the Spacebar
If your character isn't facing the right direction when you click Page Up Page Down or Enter she'll say she quot can't manage it quot or quot I can't do anything quot or something similar
She doesn't give you many clues WalkthroughYour character is a little girl named Miette
You start out in what looks like a schoolroom at the orphanage run by Pieuvre the Siamese twins
Pieuvre wants you to steal some money
Hit the Page Down key to talk to Pieuvre and get a hint on where to get a necessary key
You can try to talk to her some more but you won't get any more clues
There's nothing in this room that you need yet and if you don't leave the room and get to work Pieuvre will have you thrown in the cellar
So don't take too long about leaving
Walk over to the door orient yourself and hit Enter to open the door and leave
If you get thrown in the cellar don't worry
This time they forgot to lock the door
You won't always be so lucky
Usually when you get thrown in the cellar it's Game Over Outside walk over to the old man Pelade who is sitting in the chair orient yourself and hit Page Down to talk to him
The image of a camera that flickers over in the upper right corner of your screen means you can get a different camera angle by hitting the Spacebar
What a crabby old grouch
At least he gives you a key
Click the Tab key to put the key in inventory
Walk out past the dog and across the next screen to go down the stairs
If you want Miette to run hold down the Control key
Going downstairs is automatic but she'll probably do a little dance to line herself up
You can make her run downstairs instead of walking by holding down the Control key Run all the way down all the flights of stairs
When you reach the lowest level turn around and walk next to the water
There will be a niche under the stairs
Walk into it and move your character around until you see the icon for a scrubbing brush appear in the upper right corner
While the brush icon is in view hit Page Up to pick it up and Tab to put it in inventory Move back out the way you came to the foot of the stairs
Don't go back upstairs
Turn left into an alleyway with a barrel shortly after the foot of the stairs
Follow walkways through several screens
Ignore the watchman wearing dark blue unless you want to hear him chase you off
He's going to be the victim of your robbery and you have to find a way to get him away from his post
Continue following the walkway around the building
At the bottom of a short set of stairs turn right onto a pier
See that little silver line on top of a brown package
That's an inventory item you'll need
Walk behind the pole and next to the building and you'll find a way to get to it
Miette will probably need to dance around to orient herself before stepping up on the boxes
When you see the icon for the item appear in the upper left click Page Up to pick it up
It's an iron bar
You can either put it in inventory or not because you will use it soon Walk back onto the pier and then follow it out toward the lighthouse
You'll want to save your game somewhere around here in case you can't figure out how to hide yourself quickly enough
Before you commit your act of vandalism you may want to practice hiding
The place to hide is behind the barrels and big reels of rope that are standing to the right of the lighthouse door
Move Miette over there and hold down the Alt key to make her duck down and hide
Find a spot where she'll bend down
She seems to like to be facing front when she bends down Now for the vandalism
Miette is going to short out the lighthouse
Move Miette over to the other side of the lighthouse
If you've put the iron bar in inventory take it out by first using the Tab key to bring up the inventory highlighting the iron bar by using the arrow keys to select it then clicking Page Up
Stand Miette directly in front of the control panel on the side of the lighthouse that has the little orange light on it and click Enter
If you're oriented right you'll see a cut scene where Miette shorts out the lighthouse and the watchman has a fit and starts out to investigate
Now Miette must hide
The watchman may take a little while to arrive but keep holding down the Alt key so Miette remains hidden
When the watchman arrives Miette makes a comment about how she thinks she'd better stay put for a bit
After fussing around a bit with the control box the watchman will eventually go inside the lighthouse to try to fix it
Now is Miette's chance to break into his office Run back down the pier turn left up the stairs follow the walkway around the building and take the walkway that angles off the main walkway to reach the place where you first saw the watchman
Move around until you see the camera icon in the upper right and click the Spacebar in order to see the door you must go through
You have the key
Open the inventory with Tab cycle to the key with the arrow keys and click Page Up to get the key quot in hand quot Click Enter to unlock the door
Put away the key using Tab and click Enter again to walk inside the building
If you don't put the key away Miette will just lock the door back up Once inside the building aim Miette at the light switch next to the door and click Enter to turn on the lights
See that electrical stuff going on around the cabinet at the other end of the room
The booty is in the electrified cabinet and Miette can't get it until the electrification is turned off
For some reason it's tied into the cash register
Go figure
Anyway move Miette in front of the cash register click Tab cycle to the brush and click Page Up to get the brush in hand
Click Enter and Miette will put the brush in the cash register drawer wedging it open
For some reason this turns of the electricity to the cabinet
I have no idea why
Anyway now Miette can walk over to the cabinet orient herself and click Enter
This starts a cut scene where Miette sets off an alarm grabs what she came for and is accosted by the watchman
She is rescued by the man called One who seeks Miette's help in rescuing his little brother Denree who was kidnapped in the introductory video
Miette has to get back to Pieuvre though You find yourself back in the schoolroom and Pieuvre gives you your new mission
This time she wants you to break into the loan shark's safe and bring back whatever you find there
You can ask her them a question with Page Down but you won't get anything else out of her them besides threats
Immediately turn around and run hold down the Control key to the back of the room and pick up the bag of marbles off of the shelf using Page Up

The timing isn't all that close but better safe than sorry Once outside turn to your right walk to the door and click Enter to enter the kitchen
Walk up to the boy and click Page Down to discover he's making a potion for Pieuvre
Try to pick up the potion bottle with Page Up
The boy wants you to find his marbles first
Click Tab to open inventory then cycle to the bag and click Page Up
Then click Enter to swap the bag for the potion
If Miette is not close enough to the bottle she'll let you know
Put away the potion bottle with Tab and click Page Down to talk to the boy
He'll give you a hint where to find the loan shark but he won't tell you anything else
Walk to the other side of the kitchen and locate a chicken drumstick on the countertop to the right of the refrigerator
Page Up and Tab to pick it up and put it in inventory
Walk to the door and hit Enter to leave the kitchen Walk forward and look in a corner between the cellar stairs and the dog to find an empty bottle
There are two there but you only need one
Orient Miette so the bottle icon appears Page Up to pick it up and Tab to put it in inventory
Walk past the dog and continue toward the top of the screen to exit
Follow the walkways and go down all those flights of stairs
As you go downstairs you'll see an old drunk

Go talk to the drunk
He's hungry so give him the chicken leg
Tab cycle to the chicken leg and Page Up to select it
Then click Enter to give it to him

It was a sleeping potion
Now Miette can loot his house but first she needs to collect a couple of items

If you've put it in inventory Tab cycle to the door handle and Page Up
Stand in front of the door and Click Enter to enter the old guy's place
Put the door handle away with Tab
There is a light switch next to the door
Aim Miette at it and click Enter to turn on the lights
Now walk Miette over to the other side of the room and locate the key on the bed
With the key icon at the upper left of the screen click Page Up and Tab to stow it in inventory
That's all you need here
Walk Miette back to the door and click Enter to open it
If you want to you can turn out the light first by aiming at the switch and clicking Enter

Walk to the door that's a couple of steps away from the dog click Tab cycle to the quot key of the courtyard door quot click Page Up and then the Enter key to open the door
Click Tab to put the key away and then Enter to go through the door
If you didn't give the dog that sausage he'd bark and wake up the old man
And you'd have had to endure all that snoring for nothing You're at the top of a long flight of stairs
Go down and turn to Miette's right player's left past the Deli
Walk over to the guard and Page Down to talk to him
Another disagreeable old crab
Go back past the stairway and through a couple of more screens to see a man fixing a car
Walk through the gate approach the man and talk to him using Page Down
If you get Miette oriented right you can see the man has a tool Miette can pick up
Wait until he leans over and has his head down in the car and snatch the tool with Page Up while he's not looking
Turn Miette around and walk toward the back wall
There is a bell on the back wall that Miette needs
Use the tool to detach the bell from the wall so Miette can retrieve it
With the tool quot in hand quot and the bell icon in view at the upper left of the screen click Enter
Put the tool away with Tab and pick up the bell with Page Up
Now let's go harass that pesky guard Go all the way back past the stairs and the deli to where the guard was posted
If you've stowed the bell in inventory click Tab cycle to the bell and click Page Up to get it ready
Standing next to the guard click Enter
Aha
So he has sensitive ears
And there is a metal stairway conveniently located right next to him
Walk over next to it and click Enter to hit the bell against the stairway
The guard is overcome by the noise and falls in the water
Good riddance Click Tab to put the bell back in inventory and walk on up the stairway
At the end of the walk click Enter
The door is not locked and Miette walks on in
This is the loan shark's office
Walk Miette forward and to the left of the screen to locate a little grey cubical object which will be identified in inventory as quot a little safe quot Pick it up with Page Up
Walk Miette over behind the desk with the chair to find the real safe
There is a balance scales next to it
Walk up to the scales and with the little safe quot in hand quot click Enter
The door of the big safe opens
Walk Miette over and pick up the green quot jewels quot with Page Up
Stow it in inventory with Tab and leave the office
Use the Enter key to use the door out Oops
Miette is attacked by the kidnappers as she leaves
The kidnappers are weird men with a single mechanical eye called Cyclops
Miette falls in the water and sinks like a stone
That inventoryshe's carrying must be pretty heavy
In a cut scene she is found by a strange man in an antique diving suit
She awakens in his submarine with all her inventory gone missing Explore the room
You're in a submarine belonging to your rescuer who is currently snoozing on his bed over in the corner
You'll find a couple of switches on the wall
Face one of the switches and click Enter to pull it down
Now try pulling the other switch
The first switch pops back up
What can we use to make the switch stay down
There doesn't seem to be much we can pick up
Well there is something but it's a little hard to find
There is a block of wood hiding over in one of the corners
It's in the view with the brown brick thing furnace
over in the corner with a barrel to the right the wall ladder to the left and the periscope near the top of the screen
Walk Miette right in front of the brick thing behind the boxes and garbage can and rotate her around if necessary until the icon for the block of wood appears in the upper left
Click Page Up to pick it up and walk to the right side of the screen to return to the switches
With the block of wood quot in hand quot face a switch that is pulled down and click Enter
Face the other switch and pull it down An alarm goes off
It startles the man sleeping in the bed who you may have noticed earlier
He's a restless sleeper but tough to wake up and he goes right back to sleep
Walk over to him
He speaks a word here and there in his sleep but Miette won't talk to him or try to rouse him
Walk to the end of the bed and face the green thing at the edge of the shelf above the bed
Miette will see a key
Click Page Up and Miette will reach up and get the key
Oops she knocked down the green thing and it broke releasing some sort of green gas
The man breathes the gas and suddenly becomes somewhat coherent
Here is your chance to get some idea of what is going on in this weird game
The man says he's created a monster
He must be a mad scientist
The monster is called Krank and is stealing the dreams of children since he is unable to dream himself
Krank kidnaps children and has them taken to his lab to use them as guinea pigs
Well there's no sense standing around listening to this nut
He's gone incoherent again
What else can we do here There is one thing
Walk over to the screen where you picked up the wooden block only instead of walking behind the garbage can walk up to the side of the gray crate that's under the periscope
Miette can climb this crate
Walk her into it from the side using the forward arrow
She'll probably do her little dance like she does when she's preparing to climb stairs
Once on top of the crate walk up to the periscope eyepiece and click Enter to see a cut scene of small figures being herded onto a tugboat by a larger figure
The children being taken to Krank's lab apparently
Looking through the periscope is not required to finish the game but once you leave the submarine you can't get back in
And no you don't get to navigate the submarine
This isn't Lighthouse Now you're ready to leave
Walk over to the door at the opposite side of the room
Face the door get the key quot in hand quot with Tab and Page Up
Then hit Enter to use the key to open the door
If Miette says quot I don't think I can manage it quot make sure she's close enough to the door to interact
Miette unlocks the door
Put the key away with Tab and click Enter to exit the room Go up the stairs and follow the walkway into the next screen
There is a cigarette lighter in this screen that Miette will need
It's hidden behind that gray trapezoid shaped block thing that's on the curved gray area that projects slightly off the walkway and over the water
Walk Miette behind the trapezoidal thing and rotate her around until the icon for the cigarette lighter appears in the upper left of the screen
If it doesn't appear try taking a step in one direction or other and rotate her again
Once you see the icon click Page Up to pick up the lighter and Tab to stow it in inventory Continue toward the front of the screen and up the next stairway
Follow the walkway around and down the next set of steps down into the next screen
Go up two short flights of steps and follow the walkway into the next screen You will get an isometric view of a fenced in area with some crates on the lower left side
Miette can climb the crates just as she climbed the crate in the submarine
Once you get her in the right position you can just walk her onto them with the forward arrow and she will climb into the fenced in area
Walk her down the crates on the other side Now to find another inventory item which you can't see
It's near the lowest corner of the enclosed area
A gray roof that runs from the bottom of the screen to the right side of the screen blocks any view you might have had of the object Just walk Miette around along the line of the roof and keep checking for the icon to appear in the upper left of your screen
The item isn't too far from the lowest roof seam
Page Up to pick it up and Tab to stow it in inventory
It was a candle
Who could have guessed Now walk toward that table under the awning near the top of the screen
Miette will find a scissors on the table
Wow
It actually looks sort of like a scissors
Pick it up with Page up and stow it in inventory with Tab There's what looks to be a stone block dangling by a rope over an open hatch in the floor
Looks like an accident waiting to happen doesn't it
Let's get to work
But SAVE your game first if you want to experiment
If you try the scissors you'll have a Game Over
You need a delayed reaction
Put the candle on the table
Click Tab cycle to the candle Page Up to select it and Enter to put it on the table not far from where the rope is
If you aren't close enough to the table Miette will tell you she doesn't think she can manage it
With the candle in place bring up the cigarette lighter with Tab cycle and Page Up
Click Enter to light the candle and a cut scene starts
Miette will go hide behind a nearby door
A woman in a red dress comes out and investigates
Miette ducks inside while the woman's attention is diverted and finds One blubbering and drinking himself silly because he thinks the Cyclops have killed Miette
Miette tells him she's OK and that the Cyclops are taking the children to Krank's lab on the oil rig to be used in experiments
One is worried about his little brother Denree
The woman in red returns to the room and One tells Miette to run You find yourself in another brick area near water
Walk forward and toward the left and follow the walk through two or three screens until you find a man painting a boat
Walk around behind the boat face the man and talk to him using Page Down
Miette asks him how to get to the oil rig
The man says to ask the fisherman
Pick up the painter's spare paint brush if you can
If the painter is on the wrong side of his paint can you won't be able to get to it and you'll have to go away and look around at something else for a while
Hopefully he is standing on the opposite side of his paint can from Miette and she can reach his second paint brush which is sitting on the edge of the paint can
Use Page Up when you see the icon for the paint brush
Then click Enter to fill the brush with paint Toward the back of the screen with the painting man is an exit to the left
It's located near where you first entered the screen the first time
This exit to the left will take you past one screen to a screen with two stairways that lead down to piers at the right and the left side of the screen
If you take the stairway on the right you will find One waiting in a boat
If you take the stairway on the left you will see the fisherman who you need to talk to
Go back upstairs and move to the screen to the left
A man with a Cyclops eye blocks your path and will slap you if you try to talk to him telling you to get lost
If you weren't able to get the paint filled brush earlier go back to the man painting the boat and get it now If you have the paint brush use Tab cycle to the brush and click Page Up to get it quot in hand quot Go to the obnoxious Cyclops man and click Enter to use the wet paintbrush on him
Miette paints over his Cyclops eye and he freaks out and falls backward into the water
You can go talk to the fisherman now if you want
But he won't answer your question about the location of the oil rig unless you have a certain item
Let's go look for some inventory Go back to the screen with the boat painting man then up the long stairway behind the painter's boat and again up another long stairway
At the end of the stretch of walkway after the stairs before it makes a right angle turn there is a window with an empty tin can on the sill
Pick up the can using Page Up Go back the way you came down the walkway down the two flights of stairs past the man painting the boat toward the back of the screen through the exit on the left and across the screens to where you painted the Cyclops man
Walk down the dock to where the fisherman is sitting
Talk to him using Page Down until he mentions he's fishing for his lost can
Get your empty can quot in hand quot with Tab cycle Page Up
Click Enter to give him the empty can
It also seemsto work if you use Page Up to put down the can near the fisherman
He is most appreciative and tells you about the Chinese tattoo artist who has a map to the location of the oil rig
He even tells you how to get hold of the map without having to pay the guy a lot of money
Sounds like a plan Go back past the screen with the stairways leading down to the piers
Exit right through one screen to the screen with the man painting the boat
Go up the long stairways and this time pass the windowsill where you found the empty tin can
Continue along the walkway to an alley with grey cobblestones
At the far end of the alley where the exit is blocked by a wooden gate locate an atomizer near the base of a gray oil drum
Page Up to pick up the atomizer and Tab to stow it in inventory
You'll need it later and picking it up now will save some time Move along the right side of the alley
You may have to hit the spacebar when the camera appears in the upper right to access the screen with the tattooist
Stand to the left of his kiosk just in front of the orange railing and click Enter
Miette will use an unseen screw which will cause a piece of wood to fall down and clobber the tattooist
Take advantage of his unconscious state to steal the map on his table
Page Up to put it in inventory Follow the walkways back from the alley down the stairways to the guy painting the boat
Walk or run to the exit partway up the screen and to the left then down through the next screen to the screen with the two stairways to the piers
Go down the stairway on the right and out to where One is waiting in the boat
Aim Miette at One
If you stowed the map earlier click Tab cycle and Page Up to get the map quot in hand quot Click Enter to give One the map
Well it's a good map but how are they going to find their way through the fog
Looks like we need more inventory Go down to the end of the pier you're standing on to find a stick
Page Up and Tab to pick it up and stow it in inventory
Walk or run back up the pier and climb the stairs
You should now be in the screen with the two stairways leading down to the piers
Move toward the back left of this screen and you should find another exit
Make your way through a couple more screens and you'll find Marcello sitting near his trailer
There's no doubt who it is
His name is right on the trailer
There is also a sign saying Cirque de Puces which means quot flea circus quot in French
Guess what Marcello does or did for a living
Talk to Marcello using Page Down
Use Page Down about five times to hear all he has to say about his unique killer fleas trained to kill when they hear his music
Getting any ideas
Walk over to face the crank organ and click Enter a couple of times to get more comments from Marcello The fleas are in a jar to the left of where Marcello is sitting
You can't get past Marcello so you'll need your stick
Face the jar Tab cycle to the stick Page Up to hold the stick and Enter
Miette knocks over the jar
The fleas get out and jump on Marcello
Face the crank organ and click Enter and the fleas will kill Marcello
The icon for Marcello's compass watch will now appear if you aim Miette at Marcello correctly
Click Tab cycle to the atomizer and click Page Up to get the atomizer quot in hand quot Move around Marcello until you see the icon for the compass watch appear in the upper left then click Enter to get rid of the fleas
Click Tab to put away the atomizer and Page Up to steal Marcello's compass watch
Yes you killed the poor guy just to steal his watch
Nasty
If you try picking up the watch before you use the atomizer on the fleas Miette refuses saying the fleas will bite her
I wonder what's in that atomizer anyway
Maybe some really cheap perfume like quot Avon's Revenge quot Now that you done the dirty deed and have your ill gotten gains exit right from Marcello past two screens to the screen with the stairways leading down to the piers
Go down the stairway to the pier on the right and walk to where One is waiting in the boat
Aim Miette at One
Tab cycle Page Up and Enter to give One the compass watch
A cut scene will start in which Miette and One row out to the oil rig and rescue about four kids one of which I assume is Denree One's quot little brother quot The movie was better

And half the scientists that work there don't even now what he looks like quot A quot Doesn't surprise me quot B quot Fancy another cup of tea before we start loading quot After this conversation you can talk to the men yourself
There are several options but these lines will surely lead you through
quot Visions of a new world quot
quot Dr Murphy senior chemist quot
quot I've been sent out here to give you a message quot
quot The planes must not fly tonight quot
quot Because the drug has been contaminated and won't work quot After this you'll talk to Rooter himself
Again you'll have to find the right answers and again there are several good and bad ways to do this
Try
quot I know Sir and I'm extremely sorry about it quot
quot There was an accident with a Bunsen burner and some bleach quot
quot I'm afraid so quot
quot We can get it done soon quot Rooter is satisfied with the things you've said and gives you these instructions quot Make sure you do
Incidentally we haven't met yet have we
Meet me tonight at the National Theater
Pick up your ticket for 'Who wants to rule the world' and meet me outside after the show quot Go to the national Theater
Go across Westminster Bridge and then left alongside the Thames
Just before a gray building on the map you turn right and then take the first turn left
You'll receive a ticket to the show and you'll meet Stanislav himself afterwards
You're blindfolded in the car and finally arrive at Rooters place
Try these lines is conversation with the bad guy himself
quot There was a mix up between specimens quot
quot One of the young technicians had a hang over quot
quot I have dealt with the man in question quot
quot We are back on course now quot
quot We can have a new batch ready by tomorrow quot Note if you're the morbid kind of adventurer you might try to give some witty answers
Just see what Clarence does to you
Hum
Now Rooter tells you he'll meet you later on Leicester Square
Clarence will drop you off at Murphy's house well your house in his opinion of course
Fool Clarence and go in the house
Then leave again
CUFFING ROOTER Go back to your hotel and pick up the message green corner at reception desk
it's from your contact and she asks you to meet her at Marble Arch
This location is north of the hotel
Go there and meet Kate again
Kate quot Thanks for coming
How are you getting along quot John quot I think it's all coming together
I've managed to substitute the disk and delay the planes
I've met Mr Rooter but they blindfolded me in the car so I'm not sure where he lives
It's about ten minutes drive from the National Theater
Anyway I'm supposed to be meeting him at Leicester Square later
So I'll try to work out some kind of plan to bring him down by then quot Kate quot But
But that's great
We've got enough evidence to send him down for many years now
And it's only a matter of tracking him down
If I arrange for undercover agents to be at Leicester Square we should be able to get him quot John quot He's very paranoid about security
He'll probably have a bunch of heavies with him and they'll all be armed quot Kate quot Listen
I'm going to give you this micro transmitter
This is really new and is undetectable in any ordinary security search
You swallow it
Now we can track you
Whatever happens stick to Rooter so that wherever you are Rooter will be
We will follow you and at the right moment we'll come in and get him
Dead or alive Oh John About the micro transmitter
It's very expensive
So we'll be needing it back afterwards quot John quot Yeah
But but
I might have known quot You swallow the transmitter right away
Now go to Leicester Square
This location you can find on the map a square between roads left of Covent Garden besides the subway sign
Before you go you should SAVE the game here
Let me explain why
When you've found the right spot on Leicester Square someone will come up to you and tell you that there's been a change of venue
Mr Rooter wants to meet you at Parliaments Square
Before you meet they want to search you for security
What you've got to do now is follow the girl to a less crowded location where she can search you
If you lose the girl you're stuck This is why you had to save the game you can't save it during the next part of the game
There's only one right move to make and every other thing you do as saving the game will make you lose the girl and the game
So be sure you saved the game before you go to Leicester Square
When the girl leaves follow here by these movements One step forward new movie clip one step forward again new movie clip turn left and take one step forward new movie clip and turn left again with another step forward last movie clip of you being searched
Now go to Parliaments Square which is near the orange Information sign west of Westminster Bridge
Turn east there
Rooter is getting really suspicious now because he's changed venue again
He now wants to meet you in St James' Park
Go there and turn around to face the park itself
When you're on the right spot a movie clip will come up in which you see the arrest of Rooter
Thanks to the transmitter you'll have some agents to help you getting rid of Rooter's goons

COMERWalkthroughwritten by Mr Bill Game produced by Shine Studio Many years from now scientists find a site of human remains dated as early as the Jurassic period before the extinction of the dinosaurs Many years from then they find another Introduction This is an unusual and deeply philosophical game
In some respects very reminiscent of Myst even with snatches of Myst music it nevertheless stands on its own as a work of art in its own right with beautiful original graphics and music both original music and classical adaptations to be enjoyed throughout the game
The music CD is also available from Shine Studio
PLEASE NOTE the hypothesis of the story is imaginative and very unusual and creates much food for thought
Because it is so unusual we have included observations about the unfolding story throughout
At the end of this walkthrough we have also included a final commentary about the ending by Kyle Choi author of COMER as well as a brief commentary of our own
But please play the game before you read it so you don't spoil it for yourself
So the intent of this thorough step by step and in depth walkthrough is to not only help you solve the puzzles to complete the game but also to help you enjoy understand and appreciate the fascinating story involved
My hope also is that this style of walkthrough may help the novice and possibly the intermediate adventure gamer to learn how to go about discovering and solving all that needs to be done without losing sight of the story itself the most important part of any adventure game and have fun along the way the second most important thing about any adventure game Note About Loading A Previously Saved Game And Saving You will NOT have to start each time from the first CD
To start a saved game on another CD other than the first CD click on the word COMER in the menu at the top of the introductory screen do NOT click on the introductory screen
Then click on the word OPEN and then either click once on the saved game you wish to open and then on OK or double click on the saved game you want to open
The saved game will always take you to the beginning of that area but don't worry everything that you have already completed in that area has been saved
How to Approach the Game Explore everywhere and look at everything
There is much beauty to see and hear in every location
And it may only be after you have explored an area thoroughly that you know what to do next
Don't be in a hurry to finish the game
After all you'll miss it when it's over
Only use this walkthrough if you are hopelessly stuck or in order to make sure you haven't missed something in a given area
Otherwise you will miss the adventure and the sense of accomplishment of discovering things on your own
You may want to read through it completely however after you have finished the game to clarify any elements of the story which were not clear to you
The Adventure Begins You are the th Comer
It is only in our own age when scientists finally find a site of the earliest human remains which proves that we did live among the dinosaurs
Later another site is found the cradle of a new higher being
You must find a way to terminate the experiment and save humanity thus completing the mission which the forecomers before you were unable to accomplish

Turn either to the right or to the left twice and you will again see the down arrow
Click on it now
Another elevator
It's dark in here but those lights along the sides are certainly beautiful aren't they
Notice the diagonal arrow on the right it will take you back up again if you click on it
Let's move forward times towards the door
You now see a doorknob on the right and something white on the left
Click on the white area on the left
We'll I'll be it's a light switch
Turn to your left once and look at the room with the lights on
Ok let's turn to your left one more time and turn the door knob
Wonder what's in this white room
Move forward once and turn left
Four pictures depicting the four seasons
A seedling on the left depicts SPRING next a flower for SUMMER then a fallen leaf for FALL and finally on the right a snowflake for WINTER
Now turn right twice
Here we see a globe on the left a white screen with an image again of that island off in the distance straight ahead it must be important it's everywhere and a piano under a painting on the right
Move forward once and turn right
Click on the painting
It's a picture of this house in the fall like it is outside right now
Click on the down arrow and you get a view of the piano
Click on the piano
What a lovely tune
It reminds me of falling and dancing leaves in the breeze
Turn right or left twice and then move forward once by clicking directly on the globe
Notice that you now have a hand cursor on the globe and that North America is receiving a fair amount of light the sun's energy
Place the hand cursor at the lower left hand side of the globe depress the left mouse button and drag the now closed hand cursor to the upper right hand side of the globe and then release the left mouse button
Hey the globe rotates so that North America is now getting less light than before less of the sun's energy
Turn right twice
Wow the painting has changed
Click on the painting
Looks like this house in the winter season doesn't it
Click on the down arrow in order to look at the piano
Click on the piano again
This music sounds like a brisk and happy wintry day
Interesting
By turning the globe we have changed the season in the painting and the music
Turn right move forward once and then turn left
Move forward towards the door and then turn the door knob
Move forward times and then click on the diagonal cursor on the right pointing upwards
Listen to that wind up here on the surface
What happened to the birds
Move forward twice and turn to your right
Look at all the snow and the leaves are gone from the trees
No wonder I was so cold it's winter up here now
Turn twice to the left
You don't suppose that by turning the globe we changed the seasons
Why would we do that
Let's go back into the house
Turn left and move forward times
That hallway looks different
Move forward one more time
The music is different and there are pictures on the walls
What's happened to the water
It looks like ice now could it be
Turn left
Is this the start of a story maybe your story
Turn to the right move forward once and then click on the diagonal arrow on the lower right of the screen
I think that IS ice
It didn't take long to freeze all that water did it
Now click anywhere on the screen to return to looking down the hallway then turn left again
A volcano and a village below the volcano
Turn right move forward once and again turn left
A monster spewing out fire onto the people and their village
Turn to the right move forward once and turn left again
Could this be a sacrifice to the monster
Turn to the right move forward once and turn left again
Looks like a stranger is going to rescue the maiden from the horrible fire spewing monster
Turn to the right move forward once and turn left again
This stranger appears to have a head resembling the sun and is slaying the monster
Turn right twice
Darkness seems to have overtaken the village now
Turn to the right move forward once and turn left again
The villagers seem upset with the faceless stranger
Turn to the right move forward once and turn left again
The stranger has to defend himself and the maiden from the angry villagers
Turn to the right move forward once and turn left again
The stranger and the maiden ride off into the volcano to escape the violence
Turn to the right move forward once and turn left again
Time passes as different peoples come and go
Turn to the right move forward once and turn left again
Could this depict the stranger whose faceless head resembled the sun and the pretty young maiden
Why is the maiden so sad
Now turn left move forward times and then turn right once
Move forward twice
Do we want to go out there
It is a little warmer in here
Why did we change the season
Hey wait a minute wasn't that water when we went down in the elevator earlier
You don't suppose
Let's go look
Move forward once and follow the path if the snow hasn't covered part of it back to the elevator
The snow wasn't too bad
Now that we are back in the elevator click on the down arrow
Look at that
The water's frozen
Now maybe we can walk to the island from here brrrrr
Move forward once
Sand Dunes amp Native Huts Brown Hills Insert Disk Where did this lighthouse come from
But wait I don't see a light in it do you
What is it
Maybe it's an observation tower
This is really a magical world
The ice is gone and it feels warm again
Notice a hand cursor on the small tower on the left of the pier
Click the hand on the right side of the small tower and while holding down the left mouse button drag the closed hand cursor to the left side of the small tower
It turns and so does the big one
There doesn't appear to be a ladder on the other side of the large tower
Oh well lets go check out the big tower
Move forward three times
Be careful those boards on this pier seem to be very far apart from one another
Now click on the up arrow at the top of the screen and you will be looking up the ladder
Move forward and you will climb the ladder into the observation tower
Hey there is a pier leading to land on the other side of this tower
Move forward once
There are buildings over there
Click on the down arrow at the bottom of the screen
Oops just as I thought no ladder over here
Well we do know that this tower turns but how from up here
We could turn the small tower again but I can't reach it from here my arms aren't that long
But this seems to be a magical land so click on the up arrow at the top of the screen and then turn right or left once and move forward
Click anywhere on the water where you have a forward arrow and like magic the tower rotates so that the ladder is now on the other side facing the land
Click on the down arrow at the bottom of the screen and you will now be looking down the ladder
Move forward and you climb down to the bottom of the ladder and are facing the interesting looking buildings on the beach
Move forward three times and you are standing on the beach facing one of the buildings
Move forward again more times and you find yourself facing a round stone with the pattern of three again that we saw in the house
Looks like a sun symbol at the top and a fish on the lower left but I'm not sure yet what that symbol is on the lower right
Now click on the diagonal arrow in the upper right hand corner of the screen
Then move forward to climb up the ladder onto the deck of this hut
Turn left then move forward once turn right again move forward once and then turn right again
You should be facing a doorway with a strange box like device inside the hut
Move forward once through the door then click on the down arrow at the bottom of the screen
That looks like a plunger that you can push down
I hope it isn't connected to a box of dynamite somewhere
Oh well here goes
Click on the handle and while holding down the left mouse button move the closed hand cursor downward and then let go of the left mouse button
You should see the handle go down and the color of the small ring around the shaft of the handle turn from orange to blue green it should stay blue green
So far so good nothing exploded
Now click on the up arrow at the top of the screen and you will be looking at that box like device again
Move forward once and turn to your left
There's that fish symbol again on a button on the side of the device
Wonder what this thing is
Lets find out click on the fish like symbol which will push in the button
Hey this thing is a holographic video projector
Doesn't that person look like Einstein
Listen carefully it's a little hard to understand
His message is I am the th Comer
Having witnessed what is happening here and what was interpreted by our romantic forecomers I am obliged to present the other side of the story
Concerning the creation of life Many of us noticed that the dinosaur was never mentioned in all the holy works including the Bible
Some may think it is not important since the focus of those works is about human creation
Others explain that those works are merely based on human witnesses written with no knowledge of dinosaurs
Here is another possibility the dinosaur was purposely not mentioned
Now back to the story or should I use a better term the experiment
The romantic presentation reveals characters which I would give names from the modern point of view
First the dragon in the top of the volcano that's the dinosaur
Second the villagers humans
And the third the one with the face of light What is that
Dinosaurs never spit fire this is nothing more than a volcanic eruption
Or you can interpret it as the dinosaur became ruthless and jeopardized the experiment of the newer species humans
So it was decided to exterminate the dinosaur in order to make way for humans
That's fascinating
I never thought of that possibility before
Does that have something to do with why you are here now
We have to learn more
OK now let's first turn right and then move forward once by clicking just to the left or above the projector not on the projector
Move forward again through the door of the hut to the outside balcony
Turn right and then move forward twice in order to climb down from the hut and back onto the dunes
Click on the diagonal arrow located on the right of the screen that is pointing to the upper right
Looks like there are some larger huts up there
I guess we have quite a bit of climbing to do don't you think
Click on the diagonal arrow on the right that now is pointing downward
Ah there's another hut that we can reach
Let's go
Move forward times and then click on the diagonal arrow on the left that is pointing upward and then turn to the right
This is where Comer stayed
Let's go up and see if we can figure out who Comer was
Move forward and then click on the up arrow
Well we're on Comer 's deck
Turn left and then click on the diagonal arrow that is pointing up and to the right found on a cabinet that has six raised panels on the front of it
Can you do anything with the raised panels
Try clicking on them
Hey each has different symbols on it
How many symbols are there on one panel
Six different symbols on each one and each panel has the same symbols hmmm
OK let's move forward twice and look at the bamboo cross over there
Maybe we can click on that orange spot
It turns blue green when you click on it but it won't stay blue green so I guess we have more to do here
Turn left twice and then move forward once
Now turn left again
That looks like a desk
I wonder what's in the drawers
How many raised panels were on that cabinet wasn't it
on the right and on the left
Hmmm
desk drawers on the left and on the right
Do you think it's a coincidence
Guess we should see what's in those drawers
Click on the diagonal arrow pointing downward and to the left that can be found on the left side of the desk
To open the top drawer click on the open hand found on the drawer's handle this closes the hand and while keeping the left mouse button down pull drag the drawer handle towards yourself then the drawer opens when you let go of the left mouse button
This drawer has a drawing of two hands
To close the drawer just click on the drawer's handle
OK open the second drawer the same way you did the first one
It's a gondola boat in Venice maybe
Hey look at the symbol in the front of the boat
We saw one like that on the raised panels of the cabinet
Close the second drawer
Open the third drawer down it's a drawing of a man
Close the drawer
The drawings in these drawers look very familiar
Let's see what is in the drawers on the right side
To back away from these drawers click anywhere except on the drawer handles
Now click on the diagonal arrow pointing downward and to the right that is found on the right side of the desk
Open the top drawer th
A letter
You can read the letter if you want but I don't know if we should
It could be personal
Oh OK
Just click on it to read it
To put it back in the drawer just click on it again
OK close the th drawer and open the middle drawer th one
It's a drawing of a path going through a group of trees
Close this drawer and open the bottom drawer th
It looks like some kind of monster but wait
Look at the little creature above the monster
It's that same fish like symbol we've seen outside the first hut on the holographic projector and on the raised panels
Let's go back to the cabinet and see if we can open it
Don't you think we have to match the symbols on the raised panels by position to the drawings in the drawers
Let's give it a try
Again to back away from these drawers click anywhere except on the drawer handles
Move your cursor now to the top of the screen and turn right once and then move forward once
Now turn right twice so that you are facing toward the cabinet
Find and click on the diagonal arrow that points upward and to the left that is located on the cabinet with the raised panels
OK what goes on the top panel on the left
Right
That top left drawer of the desk showed a drawing of hands so we choose the hand
Second panel down on the left
That strange music like symbol on the front of the gondola
Third panel down on the left
Sure
Man
Now the top panel on the right
Yes
A hand writing like the letter that we found in the top right drawer
The middle panel on the right
Yes
Trees
And finally the bottom panel on the right
The fish like symbol
Would you look at that the cabinet has opened to reveal a painting but of who
What is that large round reddish thing over the painting
When you click on it we see Leonardo da Vinci's painting of the Mona Lisa
Apparently da Vinci was the st Comer
Now I know why those drawings in the drawers looked so familiar
Wow
As a Comer it looks like you're in the company of geniuses the real adventurers of the human race with Einstein and now da Vinci
What were those flashing blue streaks that I saw at the cross when you pushed that reddish button
Say did the color change on that cross from orange to blue green
Let's go take a look at it
Move forward twice
Yes it changed from orange to blue green like the color of the ring at the base of the plunger we pushed down near the holographic projector
The color change must mean we have completed our task here
I guess it is time to find our next challenge so turn to the left twice then move forward twice and turn to the right
Move forward twice and we're off the deck of da Vinci's hut
Now let's click on the diagonal arrow on the left pointing downward and to the left then click on the diagonal arrow on the right pointing upward and to the right then move forward twice and you find yourself standing in front of another hut
Move forward once to climb up onto the deck of the hut and then move forward one more time and turn left
You are now looking into a room with a ladder
Looks like we will have to climb it and see what new adventure is in store for us up above
Move forward once and turn to the right then find the up arrow on the ladder and click on it so that you are now looking up the ladder
Move forward to climb the ladder and then turn to the left
Isn't that a portrait of the famous Egyptian Queen Nefertiti
Was she one of the Comers
OK turn back to the right and then click the down arrow at the bottom of the screen
Turn left then go forward and turn right
Hmmm
Looks like the type of fountain that is called a dragon washer
Wonder what we have to do with it
Move forward once and notice an orange light and a hand on a switch in the middle of the pot of the dragon washer
Click on the hand on the switch and we see the fluid in the pot bubble a little but nothing happens light is still orange
Notice a diagonal arrow on the right above the pot pointing downward and to the right click on it
Notice the round greenish knob that can be turned
A pair of arrows show up on it when the cursor is placed over it
Also notice that you have two different pairs of arrows one pair clockwise and one pair counterclockwise depending on whether you have the cursor on the right side or left side of the greenish knob
Notice that there are six divisions on this half circle to the right of the green knob
Choose the counterclockwise arrows and click on them or times
Hey
Some of the divisions light up
Hmmm
Now choose the clockwise arrows and click on them or times
Yeah this decreases the number of lighted divisions on the half circle
Try leaving it at lighted divisions
Now to return to the central switch and light click on the diagonal arrow pointing downward and to the left that can be found in the LOWER LEFT HAND CORNER of the screen
This time click on the diagonal arrow above the washer on the left side that is pointing downward and to the left
Again you will have two different pairs of arrows clockwise and counterclockwise one on either side of the greenish knob
Choose the clockwise pair of arrows and click on them or times
Notice we are increasing the number of lighted divisions on the half circle that is now to the left of the greenish knob
This time choose the counterclockwise pair of arrows and click on them or times
Now we see that we are decreasing the number of lighted divisions
This side of the washer works the in same way except in the opposite directions
Let's leave this one at only one lighted division
OK to once again return to the central switch click on the diagonal arrow pointing downward and to the right that is found this time in the LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER of the screen
Now with the hand click on the switch
Darn
We have some fluid moving up higher but nothing happened
We need to see if there are some clues around here somewhere for this washer otherwise we are going to have to try many many different combinations
Man that could take a while
Turn right once move forward once and then click on the down arrow found on the bottom of the screen
We haven't seen this ladder before
I wonder where it goes
Move forward to climb down the ladder then turn left move forward once and then turn left twice
Well look at that
Looks like it could be a sign or something
Maybe it will tell us which Comer Nefertiti was
Click on the diagonal arrow pointing downward and to the right found on the round thing with the sort of crescent moon shaped thing underneath
Hmmm
That's a portrait of Nefertiti again in the large round stone but facing to the right this time
What is the crescent moon shaped thing below it
Hey
Are you thinking what I'm thinking
That pole is dividing the crescent moon by what appears to be about one third on the left and two thirds on the right
Isn't that crescent shape approaching a half circle
Those shapes on the dragon washer were approximately half circles weren't they
You don't suppose
If we could rotate the crescent moon shape with the pole over it up to the left it would show that the pole is about two thirds up on the crescent shape
The dragon washer's two half circles had divisions
I bet we light up divisions two thirds of the divisions on the left side of the washer since the pole is two thirds up the crescent
If we rotate the crescent moon shaped object up and to the right again with the pole we see that the pole is about one third up the crescent shape
That should mean that on the right side of the dragon washer we light up divisions one third of
You know something
We have portraits of Nefertiti one facing to the right here and one facing to the left upstairs
I bet that and combination that we just talked about works the other way around too what do you think
Anyway I think we've got the answer
Let's go try it
Ok click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the left found on the left side of the screen then turn right and then move forward once to climb the ladder and once again be on the deck of Nefertiti's hut
Now move forward once and then turn right to once again face the washer
Click on the diagonal arrow pointing downward and to the right found above and on the right side of the washer
Choose either the clockwise or counterclockwise arrows to light up the bottom divisions of the half circle one third
To return to the central switch and the orange light click on the diagonal arrow pointing downward and to the left that can be found in the LOWER LEFT HAND CORNER of the screen
This time click on the diagonal arrow above the washer on the left side that is pointing downward and to the left
This time using either the clockwise or counterclockwise arrows set it so that the four lower divisions of the half circle are lighted two thirds
OK to once again return to the central switch click on the diagonal arrow pointing downward and to the right that is found this time in the LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER of the screen
Now with the hand click on the switch
Yes
We got the fluid to reach the points at the top and conducted what appeared to be electricity across the points
This caused the little light beside the switch to change from orange to blue green so again we must have finished our task here
I wonder what we are getting for accomplishing these tasks
NOTE If still confused look at the four pictures below
Picture
Crescent moon and pole rotated up and to the left pole two thirds up Picture
Dragon washer set correctly on the left side two thirds up Picture
Crescent moon and pole rotated up and to the right pole one third up Picture
Dragon washer set correctly on the right side one third up
OK
Turn right then move forward once click on the downward arrow and then move forward once to get down off of Nefertiti's deck
Move forward twice
Holy Smoke
Is that a bridge
Let me guess we have to cross it right
Do you have any idea where it goes
Oh alright let's go
Move forward three times
Hang on
Wow
What is that ahead
Move forward two more times
Look at that airship
Hope we get to fly it don't you
I wonder where it would take us
Maybe that island we have seen so many times earlier
OK
Let's click on the diagonal arrow that is pointing upward and to the left found around the airship
What was that noise
I thought I saw something moving upward toward the airship
There is a rope bridge going to the airship
Can we go over the bridge to it
Try clicking forward
I didn't think so
Wonder what we have to do to get to it
Click on the Down arrow found at the bottom of the screen
The drawing is in the shape of the airship and the person seems to be pointing at the small diagrams above him
What are they
Try clicking on each of the diagrams and see what happens
Don't you recognize of them
The second one reminds me of the cross at da Vinci's hut the third one is the dragon washer and the fifth one is the plunger that we pushed down in Einstein's hut
Hey there are diagrams and sections of the rope bridge to the airship
We've only done of the so far and only sections of the bridge are filled in
Don't recognize the other diagrams but I would bet we have more tasks to accomplish before the bridge completely fills in and we can use the airship
OK turn right
Another bridge to a third platform
Move forward twice
It looks like a portal window or something like that but we have more to do at the dunes so let's go back to them first
Turn left once then move forward twice then turn left again and finally move forward three times
Now we are back at the dunes
Move forward three times then turn left once and move forward twice and notice the sign to the left
Click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the left found on the sign
The sign says this is the hut of Comer
OK now click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the right found on the right side of the screen near the ladder
We now find ourselves standing right in front of the ladder to the fourth hut
Click on the up arrow found at the top of the screen in order to climb the ladder
Move forward twice then click on the lamp seen on the left side of the screen
Notice the letter on the table under the flame of the lamp
Let's read the letter
I know I was afraid to before but I have more courage now working with you
Click on the diagonal arrow pointing downward and to the left which is found on the letter
A letter signed by Sinbad
Sinbad the sailor
Sinbad of the One Thousand And One Arabian Nights
Wow
Maybe he was more than just a myth
He speaks of the one with light a sultan whom he would worship
I wonder who this ONE WITH LIGHT is
To put down the letter just click anywhere on the screen
Alright let's turn right
Hey look at the three numbers on the post to the left
Click on the diagonal arrow pointing downward and to the left that is found over the three numbers
I bet we need to push the then the twice and then the again for One Thousand And One Arabian Nights
Try it
Oh NO
Good thing I didn't bet with you I kinda like my shirt
We need to look around some more
Move forward once by clicking anywhere on the forward arrow except on the numbers themselves
Now turn left twice
I see a book on the table over on the right
Let's take a look at it by clicking forward on the right side of the pole where the book is
One Thousand And Two Nights
Where did the extra night come from
Must have been quite a night to warrant a book about it
Say
Do you suppose
Turn left once and then click on the diagonal arrow pointing downward and to the right found over the numbers
Now let's try twice and then
Wow a periscope
Why a periscope in a hut
Oh yeah he was a sailor
Didn't think they had submarines back then though
I guess we now have to open the periscope
Notice the open hand cursor on the handles of the periscope
Click on the hand cursor to close it and then drag the closed hand outward from the pole of the periscope then let go of the left mouse button
Well it opened but I don't think our task is finished yet because I see an orange colored light on the bottom inside of the periscope
What happens if you click on the orange light or the gold button
Hey
We've got a blue green light at the top inside the periscope
I think we've completed another task
OK let's leave and find the fifth and last hut here that I thought I saw high up on the dunes
Click anywhere on the forward arrow except on the periscope or its handles notice the light stays blue green and the periscope closes and we have moved forward once
Now move forward two more times then click on the down arrow found at the bottom of the screen and then click forward once to climb down off the deck of Sinbad's hut
I think that hut straight ahead is where we want to go now
Move forward four times so that you are now standing in front of the fifth hut
Move forward one more time and you are under the hut
Turn left once so that you are facing the ladder then click on the up arrow found at the top of the screen so that you are now looking up the ladder
Move forward twice to climb the ladder
Now click on the diagonal arrow on the left side of the screen that is pointing downward and to the left and then turn left once
Oh boy
chimes
I bet we have to play part of the music we have been hearing but which part
I was never any good at these I hope you are just kidding
Notice the down arrow
Click on it and we see a model of a small hut and a switch on the pole below it
Move forward once to get a closer look
Notice once again an orange colored ring around the base of the switch
I bet if we get the chimes right the color around the switch will change to blue green again
Let's click the hand on the switch and drag it downwards to see what happens
Well
The color changes to blue green around the switch while the roof raises off the little model hut but the color goes back to orange when the roof comes back down on the tiny model hut
OK
We've got to work with the tune on the chimes
To back away from the little model hut click anywhere on the screen except on the switch itself then click on the up arrow at the top of the screen which will take us back to the chimes
Let's number the chimes starting with the left side of the bottom row of chimes
Thus they are from left to right numbers through on the bottom row and on the top row again from left to right numbers through
After many hours of trying you finally decide that the first six tones that occur after the repetitious introduction are
If the description above is not clear to you look at the picture below
The numbers on the picture are the order in which you strike the chimes
Picture courtesy of Shine Studio You know you've hit them correctly because then we are automatically taken down to the little model hut the roof goes up and then closes and this time the color around the base of the switch stays blue green
OK to back away from the little hut click anywhere on the scene except on the switch
Now turn to the right twice then click twice on the down arrow found at the bottom of the screen then turn to the left once and finally move forward four times
Turn left and move forward one time back to the rope bridge
Move forward three times
Hang on again
Wow
I'm getting a little used to it but I still don't like heights
Let's go look at the airship and those drawings again
Move forward two more times
OK
Let's click on the diagonal arrow again that is pointing upward and to the left found around the airship
I'd still like to know what is making all that noise
Oh I see
It makes that noise as the sections of the bridge fill in
We have done more tasks in all so far and if I listen I can hear sections of the bridge filling in
So it looks like we still have more tasks to do somewhere before we can fly this airship
At least I hope we get to fly it
Click on the down arrow found at the bottom of the screen
Try clicking on each of the diagrams again and see what others we have finished
Now we can recognize of them
The first one is the little model of the hut where we played the chimes the second is the cross at da Vinci's hut the third one is the dragon washer at Nefertiti's the fourth is the periscope at Sinbad's hut and the fifth one is the plunger that we pushed down in Einstein's hut
I don't recognize the last diagrams
Where are these tasks that we must do
Ah Ha
Maybe we have to enter that green portal like thing on the other platform
Let's go
OK turn right
Move forward twice
Well are you ready
I'm not sure I am but let's go
Click on the green circle
Whoa
What is happening
Wow
Isn't this a beautiful place
Beautiful music too
The Green Mossy Valley Of Pavilions Insert Disc Look at all those oriental looking pavilions
Everything is so green
Turn right
There's that design of three again with smaller symbols on each of the three areas
I'm not sure what the other disc is
Can we get closer
Click on the design of three
There's that fish like symbol again
We saw it on the projector in Einstein's hut and on a drawing in da Vinci's desk it was with a larger beast wasn't it
Einstein talked about dinosaurs and that drawing of the beast with the fish like symbol could be a dinosaur
The fish like symbol must represent the dinosaur which Einstein said was eliminated in order to make way for humans
Humans must be represented by the man symbol on the lower right
Could the sun like symbol at the top represent some other type of beings
Maybe those we saw depicted with a face of light
Let's take a look at the round thing beneath this design
Click on the down arrow found at the bottom of the screen
That is a water droplet symbol at the top center
The reading is
This must be the humidity here percent
No wonder everything is so green and moss covered here
Let's see what else is here
In order to back away from here click on the forward arrow at the bottom of the screen either to the right or to the left of the device that measures humidity
Now turn right once and click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the right which is found on the right side of the screen
Great two paths to choose between
Let's choose the right path
Better than choosing the wrong path wouldn't you say
Sorry
Sometimes I just can't help myself
To choose the right path click on the forward arrow
Move forward one more time and then click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the right which is found on the right side of the screen but not all the way over to the right side
That looks like a huge bell in a pavilion
Move forward three times
That is a diagram or part of one on that bell isn't it
At the lower left there is a symbol for waves
Could it stand for water
To the right of the waves is an arrow but in front of the arrow we see something in the way
It is like a bar that goes up near the top of the bell
There appears to be something at the top of the bar but it's hard to make out
I think I'll make a drawing of all this for us to use later
Let's move around the bell and see if there is more to this diagram
Turn to the right and then click once on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the left found near the left side of the screen
Now turn to your left to look at the bell again
We can see that the one pathway at the bottom on the left leads to a large pathway going upward which in turn has five different smaller pathways leading from it
Each of the five smaller pathways has the wave symbol in front of it
Notice that there is something over the top of the pathway that goes upward
Are these pathways canals or maybe pipes
Could the thing at the top hanging over the opening of the upward pathway be a stopper
If you dropped it down to the bottom would it stop the flow of water into the five smaller pathways
We need to see more of this diagram
Again turn to the right and then click once on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the left found near the left side of the screen
Now turn to your left to look at the bell again
The five smaller pathways all lead to a rod that blocks it
Say doesn't that look like a handle on the thing that is at the top of each rod
Hey they're valve controls I bet that can be turned to open or close the valves
It's hard to see but notice an arrow on the bell pointing to the right after the second pathway
There is something to the right of the arrow but I can't quite make it out
Let's see the next section of the bell
Turn to the right and then click once on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the left found near the left side of the screen
Now turn to your left to look at the bell again
That thing looks like a ring attached to a chain
Didn't we see that symbol up by the airship
You know on one of the small diagrams
Wonder where this ring is
Alright I know you've been wanting to hit the bell go ahead
Click the open hand on the pole and holding the left mouse button down drag it back to the left then let go of the mouse button
Hey it rotates and you can see the whole diagram
But it rotated too fast and I couldn't have drawn it that way
OK here is the drawing that I made for you of the diagram on the bell
Pretty good don't you think
Picture courtesy of Shine Studio OK
Now we have to find the valve controls the thing with the stopper and the ring
It looks like we need to open the big valve on the left so water can go upward to the five smaller pathways
We want the stopper to be at the top and then we need to open the second smaller valve in order for water to flow through the second pathway to the ring on a chain
Why do we want to do this
I guess it has to do with filling in that bridge to the airship
Let's turn right and then move forward five times straight toward the very large tree surrounded by the pavilion
Turn to your right then click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the left found on the left side of the screen and then click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the right found on the right side of the screen
Move forward three times and then turn left
Move forward one more time
Alright
These are the valve controls
The big one in front must be that first one that lets water reach the upward pathway
So turn it to the left counterclockwise to open it by clicking on the open hand on one of the handles and drag it counterclockwise then let go of the left mouse button
Nothing happened did it
Maybe it is already open
Try turning it clockwise
By golly it WAS already open and now we have closed it
OK turn it counterclockwise again and then leave it open
I bet all of the smaller valves are already open too
Turn each of the smaller valve controls clockwise to close them that is move the closed hand to the left then let go
Then open only the second valve from the left by turning it counterclockwise move the closed hand to the right
OK we should be done here
Turn left twice and then move forward twice toward that large tree surrounded by the pavilion
Now turn left and move forward twice
That stopper is already all the way up
I think that is where we want it because we want water to flow up the large pathway to the smaller pathways
Turn right twice and move forward twice then turn left and move forward once
Click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the left found to the left of the tree
Then click again on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the left found near the green bridge
Move forward three times toward the bell
Then turn right once and then click on the diagonal arrow twice pointing upward and to the left and found next to the bell
Now you should be looking at a tree that has what looks like a chair next to it
The pole that strikes the bell is in the upper left hand corner of the screen
Move forward toward the tree with the chair times
You should now be sitting in the chair
Isn't this music lovely
Why don't we just sit here for a while
Aren't you tired
OK OK
Turn to your right once and then notice an up arrow at the top of the screen
Click on it
How about that an elevator chair taking us up into the tree
Cool
Notice another up arrow at the top of the screen after you reach the top
Click on it
Hey this is the brass ring on the chain that we saw on the bell and on the diagram up by the airship
Notice the orange colored ring around the base of the chain
I guess you reach up and pull on it by clicking on the open hand found on the ring to close the hand and then drag the closed hand downward and let go of the left mouse button
OK
The orange ring around the base of the chain changed to blue green and stayed blue green
Another task finished
Hopefully we only have one more to go and then maybe we can fly the airship
OK click on the down arrow twice to go back down the tree
Move times toward the bell then turn right then move forward once toward the tree surrounded by the pavilion and then click on the diagonal arrow pointing downward and to the left found in the lower left hand corner of the screen near a path
Move forward twice
Wonder what we have to do here
Ready
Move forward twice and then turn left
That looks like the bird of peace a dove with an olive branch
It has a blue light
Does that mean it is OK
Can't seem to do anything here can you
Well let's turn to the right twice
That looks interesting it's another bird but it doesn't look like a bird of peace
Move forward twice
What happens if you click on the feathers of the arrow
Oh No
Looked like the feathers went along the bow to form a branch with leaves like the olive branch but the arrow went through the bird and that is not peaceful
Maybe we have to change this bird to a bird of peace
Hmmm
How do we do that and why do we want to
Turn left once then move forward twice and then turn right and move forward twice
Look a door to a building that is partly underground
Move forward one more time
Can you open the door by clicking on it
Nope
But it has the same light and color around it that the bird of peace has
So I'll bet that matching those two birds is how we unlock this door or open it
OK let's go back and see if we can make the one bird peaceful like the other one
Turn left then move forward twice then turn left again and move forward twice again
Here we are back again at the not so peaceful bird
Try clicking on the right end of the bow and while holding down the left mouse button drag it up to the beak of the bird then let go
Wow it rotated into that position
Tricky
No hand cursor this time to give away the solution
That is tricky
Well what else must we do to get a bird of peace here make it look just like the other one
Click on the feathers
Alright
We have the branch with leaves and have removed the arrow
Still not quite right though is it
Turn left and look at the other one
Notice that the olive branch is tilted out not straight up and down and bent differently
Turn back to the right
Now try dragging the bottom of the branch outward a little to the left and see what happens
Hey it bent the branch so that it is shaped like the other one
Cool
But why doesn't something happen
It looks right
Maybe something did happen
Turn left then move forward twice
Look at the bird ahead
It is now brilliantly lit with a radiating sun behind it and with no blue ring around it
Then turn left twice and look back at the bird we just finished
It sure looks the same not lit up as brilliantly but otherwise the same
Let's check the door again
Turn left once
Alright
The door appears to be open
Move forward times
It is open
There seems to be a very large table in there
Let's enter the room by moving forward once
Look the table has models of all the structures found here in this green world
We could have used this earlier to help us find where the valves and other things were located couldn't we
Oh well
We succeeded anyway
This must be our last task before we get to use the airship
I sure hope so
Don't get me wrong it's beautiful here and I love the music but I'm just anxious to find out where the airship will take us
So we'd better get started
Let's look at the other end of the table that has this miniature layout of the Valley of Pavilions
Click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the right found on the right side of the table
Then move forward twice turn left twice and move forward once
Now we're looking down on the scale model of the valley
Notice the rectangular boxes with a slot in the top of each one
Does something go in these slots
Also notice buildings on the left close to us
I don't think we have visited these yet have we
Now to back away from this table click on the dark wall above and behind the table
Turn right and notice the picture of the copper chair that took us high up into the tree
Turn right again then move forward once and notice that this picture is of the bridge and the other structure which contains the humidity measuring device and the design of three the sun like symbol one of light
man and fish symbols
Turn right and notice the stairs
We'll have to find out where they go later
Now turn left twice and notice another set of stairs
Again we'll check that area later
Turn left one more time move forward once and then turn left again
Another picture this time of where we are now as seen from just beyond the Birds of Peace
How many pictures are in this room
Turn to the right again and notice two more pictures one on either side of the stairs where we entered this chamber
pictures and little boxes with slots
Hmmm
I don't know about you but I want to know what is outside those two stairways we just saw
Maybe it will help in here
Turn right twice then move forward once and then turn left once
Move forward twice to go up the stairs and outside
We seem to be in some kind of enclosed garden area
Then turn right once then move forward three times then turn left and look at the interesting art work then turn right once then move forward once and then turn left again to look at more art work
Wow this is Leonardo da Vinci's painting of THE LAST SUPPER Jesus with His Disciples but with a difference
Notice that here Jesus has a head of light just like the man in the paintings in the hall of the Solar House
Does this imply that Christ was really a being of light light being that humanity drove away destroyed with violence
And was He the same One man of light that Sinbad talked about worshiping
Turn right once and move forward once again
What is this painting
Another One that radiates light but this time the head looks disembodied more like a ball of light with the suggestion of a face in it
One thing is for sure the man with a head that radiates light is a recurring theme in a lot of humanity's famous art especially our religious art we call it a halo
Turn left once to note the artwork then turn right twice then move forward once and then turn left once
There is another structure over there that looks like one that we saw on the table of miniatures inside
Move forward twice then click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the left found on the left side of the screen
Move forward once and notice what looks like a huge switch
I bet we have to throw that switch
But wait a minute
What is that on the floor
Click on the down arrow found on the bottom of the screen
It's a book
Click on it
Hey it's about Sinbad's missing nd Night that no one has heard of before
And why is this tale missing from the l l Nights
Can we open it
Yes
By clicking on the book itself it opens
NOTE Click on the right hand page to read the next page click on the left hand page in order to go back to a previous page and either click on the cover opposite the last page or somewhere outside the book itself to put the book down and back away from it
OK
Let's read it
What does it say
The myth that Einstein had started unraveling becomes clearer now
And in many ways it is a very familiar story to us because it is repeated in different ways in all the myths legends and religious literature of all cultures in the world
It seems that many faithful people followed the man of light and the beautiful maiden when they escaped into the volcano and after they went up into the mount it no longer spewed fire
The man of light who had saved the villagers from the fire spewing monster which was symbolic of the dinosaur according to Einstein began to be worshipped by humanity instead of worshipping their human leaders
To win back control the human chief tempted by the clown or jester what we call the devil
goes to the volcano to get the maiden
He finds no fire spewing volcano but instead a peaceful lake and he also finds that there are others there that have wings and can fly are these light beings what humanity calls angels
But when he tried to marry the girl there was a catastrophic earthquake which forever barred humanity from the mount
Is this mount this lake on top of a volcano where the light beings are just a symbol or does it really exist and if so where
Could that be the volcanic island that we saw from the Solar House
Is it possible to get to it
Is that where the airship will take us
Will we find light beings there and if so why are they there
All the paintings and drawings we've seen seem to suggest that they are a more evolved species
And why would humanity want to destroy the light beings or drive them away
Do we think they are a threat somehow to us like the dinosaur was
Why
Let's check that switch
Maybe that's our last task before being able to go
Click on an area outside the book to put it down and back away from it
Now click on the up arrow found at the top of the screen
Click on the open hand found on the handle of the switch and drag it downward then let go of the switch left mouse button
We can pull the lever but it doesn't stay down and the orange doesn't turn blue green
We must need to do something inside with those pictures and the slotted boxes on the table first
Turn right twice then move forward times then turn right once and then move forward again must click to the right of the tree and on the stairs of the building in order to get past the tree
Move forward one more time to go down the stairs
Now we know where the stairs to the right led to
Both of these stairways take us into the courtyard or enclosed garden where we found The Last Supper painting and the huge switch
Now that we are back in the sunken room let's go look at a picture more closely
Turn left then move forward once and then turn left again
Notice that round thing on the bottom of the picture that has a somewhat orange red ring around it
Can you click on it
Hey
We got a card from the picture
Does anything happen if you click on the picture
Wow
I think we were just teleported to the real area outside to the place where that picture was taken
And we no longer have the card we got
Do you suppose that each of those pictures gives us a card and that we are to place each card into the correct slotted box that is in the same position from where the picture was taken
I bet every picture will teleport us out to that position if we wanted to
However if we do that we would have to keep finding our way back to the table
Let's go back to the table and see if we can do it without all that running around
Move forward times so that we are once again standing in front of the table in the sunken room
Turn to the right and study the picture carefully
Take its card by clicking on the round thing at the bottom of the picture
It looks as though we can take only one card at a time since we are carrying it with us
We don't have an inventory area to carry them in
OK click on the diagonal arrow points upward and to the left which is found to the left of the picture
Then move forward twice you will see the card in your hand when going forward then turn left twice and then move forward once so that we are looking down on the table
Let's number the slotted boxes
How about starting on the back row from left to right as box box and box and the two in front closest to us starting with the one on the left as box and the one on the right as box
I believe this card goes into box
Go ahead and click the card on box middle one in the back row
Notice the round button on our end of the table
What happens if you push it
Oh No
the card left
I hope it will be available at the picture again
I guess if we make mistakes we have to push the button and then we can start all over
Let's go get that same card again
Click on the dark wall above the table in order to back away from the table
Turn left once then click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the right found on the left side of the screen and then move forward twice
Turn left and push the knob round thing under the picture again
Good
The card went back to the picture
Click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the left found to the left of the picture then move forward twice then turn left twice and move forward once
OK this card goes into box right
Let's get the other card found at the other end of the table and then we can do the three back here
Again to back away from the table click on the dark wall over the table
Click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the right found on the right side of the screen then move forward once and then turn right
That is the pavilion with the valve controls
Click on the knob below the picture to get its card
Click on the diagonal arrow on the right side of the picture then move forward twice then turn right twice and move forward once
Where does this card go
Yeah it looks like it goes in box
Click the card on box
OK let's get the card behind us
Back away from the table click on dark wall above table
Turn right twice and move forward once
This picture is of the bridge and humidity measuring device
Click on the knob to get its card
Now turn right twice then move forward twice
This card may go into box
What do you think
Click the card on box
Alright let's back away from the table again click on dark wall above table
Turn to the right
This is the pavilion with the chair and the tree
Push the knob to get its card then turn left and move forward once
This card obviously goes into box
Click the card on box
Let's back away from the table again click on dark wall above table then turn left once
This picture is looking down the path toward the pavilions where we are now
Click on the knob below the picture to get its card then turn right and move forward once
Obviously this card has to go into box so click the card on box
Did you notice that the light flickered and seemed to get brighter in the structure on the left nearest us when we did that
Does that mean that something changed in that structure outside
Let's go see
PLEASE NOTE If you had difficulty with the above instructions concerning the correct placement of the cards into the boxes with slots then take a look at the picture that follows
But please note that the picture over the middle box of the back row is a reverse image of the picture on the wall sorry about this error but I will try to get a corrected copy from Shine Studio
Picture courtesy of Shine Studio Alright let's back away from the table again for the last time click on dark wall above table
Notice how bright that light in the little building is now
Turn left twice then move forward once and then turn right once
Move forward twice to go up the stairs and outside
Then turn left once and then move forward times
OK
Let's try that switch again
Click on the open hand found on the handle of the switch and drag it downward then let go of the switch left mouse button
Alright
It stays down this time and the orange lines turned blue green
Turn right twice then move forward times then turn right once and then move forward again must click to the right of the tree and on the stairs of the building in order to get past the tree
Move forward one more time to go down the stairs
I think we have finished all of our tasks here in this beautiful and mysterious green world so let's head back to the airship now
Turn left once then move forward once then click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the right found on the right side of the screen
Move forward times to go outside
Now move forward times to cross the bridge
Click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the right
Take the path to the left by clicking on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the left found on the left side of the screen
Move forward times and you should see the portal
OK let's go do some flying
Click on the portal
The Airship Insert Disc Move forward twice then turn right then click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the left found near the airship
OK
The rope bridge is complete now all the way to the airship we can hear the loud sound times one for each task completed each of which gives us a completed section of the rope bridge
Click on the down arrow found at the bottom of the screen
Click on the sixth small drawing from the left and notice that it is the switch we threw in the courtyard
Now click on the seventh small drawing far right and notice that this is the chain with a ring on it that we pulled high up in the tree
We have all tasks completed so let's go flying
Click on the up arrow found at the top of the screen and then move forward times
We now find ourselves sitting in the airship facing forward with controls in front of us one on the left and one on the right
Turn to the right and notice the rear of the ship and it's propellers
Turn back to the left so we are again facing the front of the airship
I hope this airship is safe and that you know how to fly it
Do you
Alright
Then let's go
Click on the open hand on the control lever on your right then drag it to the left and then let go release mouse button
Listen to that engine
I wouldn't exactly say it's purring but it did start
Turn to the right again
Cool
The props are turning so let's go
Turn to the left again and then click on the handle of the control on your left by clicking on the open hand and dragging it to the right then let go release mouse button
Here we go
The Volcanic Island amp Beautiful Crater Lake Insert Disc Well it looks like we've finally made it
We're actually on the mount that Sinbad said humanity couldn't get to any longer
This is where the light beings are supposed to be isn't it
I'm a little nervous aren't you
Apparently we were forever barred from here because of our violence because we were a threat to them
But we must have thought that they were a far greater threat to us to our species according to the old legend recorded by Sinbad
I wonder what they look like
Like that picture in the hallway paintings or was that just a symbolical representation
But then da Vinci had Christ represented as one and he looked human at least during the time people knew Him as a man
Are they such an evolved species that they can take on different forms and if so what is their form normally when they're not interacting with humans
How can we recognize them
Look at that beautiful lake and those trees
I don't think I've ever seen water with such a clear blue green color before
What's that sound
It sounds like something or several things moaning or talking in a strange way
Click on the lake
What was THAT sound
And WHAT were those lights that flew up to the trees behind the building
Click on the lake again
Well we obviously can't get to the building that way and I didn't see any more lights this time
But I still hear that moaning noise
Turn right once
There's our airship
Turn left twice
Aha a boat
We can use that to cross the lake and get to the building
But wait a minute
What are those Roman looking columns across the lake
Maybe we can walk around the lake and see
Let's go
Turn left again and then go forward times always making sure to click forward directly on the path
Watch your step
Those trees sure are beautiful and they look so soft to the touch
Aw wouldn't you know it
Something had to block our way right
OK what do we do here
We'd better SAVE HERE in case we mess up and have to start over
Let's try matching the color of the rectangle to the color of the stone it's on
Number the rectangles from top to bottom to
Click on twice twice four times twice and leave alone it looks correct already
That did it
The column disappears into the ground and we can go forward
Go forward once
What is that behind that column
We can't go forward anymore so turn left go forward once turn right go forward once and then turn right again
A small pyramid in the middle of Romanesque columns
What's that inscribed on it
Let's get a closer look
Go forward once then click on the picture
An angel with trees on its wings
What on earth could that symbolize
I know that Sinbad's story said that the human chief found winged beings here but what do trees have to do with them
There doesn't seem to be anything else that we can do here now so let's try that building across the lake
Let's go back and get that boat
OK click anywhere but on the pyramid to back out then turn right twice go forward once turn left once go forward once turn left again go forward once to the steps and turn right
Go forward times again always making sure to click forward directly on the path then turn left
There's our boat
Click on it to get into it click forward times to cross the lake then click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the right located on the path
Go forward twice
The path forks
Maybe we'd better take a look outside before we go in since we don't know what to expect here
Click on the diagonal arrow pointing toward the left path then click forward directly on the path to follow it You can stop here and there to look around by turning to the left or the right
Notice the brilliant colors of the trees
Quite a contrast with that blue green crater lake color
OK we've found out that the path just leads around the building and we haven't seen anything else puzzling or threatening so far and we're back where we took the left path so now let's go inside
Move forward times
It looks like some kind of stone mound in the floor with some stone knobs around it
Move forward once more to stand on the mound then turn in a circle to look around by turning to the right times
Look at the strange windows or doors more like slits with bars actually
And such a strange way that they're opened in places and not in other places
There seem to be bars in each window with some of them open they're all open in the one we came in through and some of them closed
Notice the down arrow and click on it
A Greek work with a knob above it but nothing happens when you click on it
Turn right times a different Greek word in each position with a different knob but nothing happens when we click on them
Such a strange combination of Roman Egyptian and Greek elements at this place
Don't you wonder how old it is and who or what designed it and what it's for
There must be something hidden here and some way to get further in
Click on the up arrow
Let's go back outside and see if we can discover how
Turn right twice then forward twice to go back through the door then turn left to turn around and look back inside
Oh what's that button on the right side of the doorway
Must have missed that before because all we could think about was getting inside
Click on it
Hey the mound rolled over and disappeared leaving a circle in the floor and pillars raised those knobs must have been the tops of the pillars
Let's go back inside
Go forward twice
The pillars have little indentations in them
Let's try clicking on them
Hey a light comes on when you click on them
And goes off when you click again
And there's a larger indentation at the top of the pillar but nothing happens when you click on it
Let's look at all the pillars and see if they are the same
Turn right once and examine the next pillar
It looks the same
Turn right again
Hey this one by the front door has a button in the top indentation but nothing happens when we push click on it
Turn right again
This one looks the same as the other
Turn left to return to facing the one in front of the door you came in the one with the button on top
Those lights have to be a code of some kind but what
There has to be a clue around here somewhere
Maybe the Greek words but I don't read Greek do you
It's all Greek to me
Sorry about that
Wait a minute
There are lights on each column and it seems to me that we saw bars in each of the windows or doors
You don't suppose
Sure that's got to be it
Let's try it
Let's number the bars in each window door from top to bottom to and note which bars are open
Open has to mean Light right
The one behind this pillar is the one we came in so all the bars were open on it right
OK let's turn on all the lights on this pillar
Let's see about the one on our right hand side
Turn right once then click to the right side of the pillar to view the one on our right hand side
Bars and are open on this one
Turn right twice forward once and right twice again to return to the pillar and again numbering from the top click on lights and
OK let's check on the pillar to the left of the door pillar
Click left twice then forward to the right of the pillar
Bars and are open on this one
Turn left twice forward once and left twice to return to the pillar
Click on lights and
So far so good
Only one to go
Turn left once then move forward once to view the window
Bars and are open on this one
Turn right twice go forward once and right twice to return to the pillar
OK turn on lights and
Nothing happened
Did we miscount
I don't think so
Oh I know
I bet we need to push that button on the top of that pillar in front of the door we came in
Turn right twice
Click on button at the top of the pillar
That did it
We've found our way in
We're going down in an elevator
We've stopped at another level
It appears with the down arrow at the bottom of the screen that we can go down another level but let's check those doors in front of us first
Move forward twice
Sure is a strange looking door
And it has symbols on it that I can recognize more easily now the sun or light at the top a man figure on the bottom left and a dinosaur figure on the bottom right
But I can't tell what's inside there can you
Will the door open
No it's locked
Turn left once and move forward once
There's a door ahead of us
Can we get to it
Move forward once
We must have passed the door
Turn right
Darn we can't get to that door
Turn left then move forward once and then click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the right found on the right side of the screen
More doors
Can we open these
Again they are locked
I can't really see in there very well either
We've got to find a way to open these doors
Let's go down to the next level maybe we can find something there to help us
Turn left twice then move forward twice and then click on the down arrow found on the bottom of the screen
Look there's an archway straight ahead with a blue light coming from inside
Let's check it out
Move forward twice
Sounds like we are entering into a cathedral or church of some kind
Move forward twice then turn right and then move forward twice to what looks like another projector
Look that button on the top has the light symbol on it and it appears to be lit up more than the other two
Hard to make out the other two but the left one resembles a silhouette of an angel and the one on the right has something like a torch in the middle
Can't make out what is on either side of the torch though
What happens if we push the darker buttons
Try it
The images turn a blue green but don't stay that way
Do you suppose that when we complete our task here that they will stay blue green
What is our task
Why are we here
Enough worrying thinking or whatever lets' push the button with the sun like symbol on it
Go ahead and click on it
Another holographic projection from Einstein
He must have made it this far too and left a message for the next Comer and that's you you're the th Comer
I don't think any of the other Forecomers even made it this far
Let's hear what Einstein has to say
We'll have to listen carefully because he's a little hard to understand
This is the th Comer again
Let me continue my interpretation of the findings which may position us a step closer to the realm of life
The evil side of human nature could be more destructive than volcanic eruptions and probably is the reason why the nd experiment is now coming to an end
Another plan was drafted the volcano was calmed the place was chosen and the new experiment is underway
Now I understand why the dinosaur was never mentioned in all the holy works we humans face the same destiny of replacement
Here I SAW the new beings and heard their groans
They are in the form of light a pure energy state no flesh
Didn't Sinbad warn us with his story
Didn't da Vinci give us a hint in his art
Didn't we already know much of this from our own religions and prophecies
But our hope still lives
I am doing my best to intervene in the process and persuade the new beings to go away
The important fact that I have learned is that they rest in trees i e reside in live in
They are in those trees on the island and around the shore
They are everywhere
OH NO
Our worst fears are true
Humans are to be eliminated because we are too violent just like the dinosaur was eliminated before us to make way for humans
We are to be replaced with a new more evolved non violent species
A species that is already here and has been here for a long time being prepared to replace us
Evidently according to the old stories and legends these light beings what we usually call angels of light
tried to help us at first tried to change our violent nature and lift us to a higher more evolved state of consciousness remember the old legend depicted pictorially in the Solar House hallway
And we attacked destroyed or drove off every one of them every time
Was that why the maiden was shown crying
And worse Einstein says that now the experiment is drawing to a close that it's almost time for the replacement of the dominant species for the extinction of humanity
Oh No
No wonder we didn't know about them and couldn't recognize them they are usually invisible pure energy
And they live in trees maybe like our spirit lives in a body of flesh
They're everywhere
We are so used to trees that we pay absolutely no attention to them although I have heard stories about people who swear that when they sit under a tree and meditate the tree talks to them
That's what must have been the lights that we saw when we first arrived at the lake they're light beings
And that must be the sound of their voices groans that we hear
The th Comer obviously didn't finish what he was trying to do becausethey're still here
We've got to figure out how to make them leave now
Maybe he had a way set up or at least partially set up already
Or maybe he didn't have time to finish it but left us a clue about what to do
Let's go see what we can find
Turn left once and then move forward times
That looks like another doorway actually more like a tunnel directly across from us
Let's go see what's in there
Move forward times
That looks like a ship's navigational wheel
Wonder what it controls
NOTE For those of you who would like a shortcut for this section skip the following very long paragraph and read the shortcut which follows
But make sure you read through the following long paragraph for observations about the story and look at all the pictures so that you see the clues that you will need later
Let's turn the wheel and see what happens
Click and drag the closed hand on the wheel only once to the right then let go
Hey look
That large pillar in front of us turned
That must have opened or turned something up above
Let's go up and see what changed if anything
Turn right then go forward times to the small round platform of the elevator and then click on the up button once
That door still appears to be closed
Let's check the other one
Turn left twice
No it still looks closed too
It must have been something else
Turn left twice and click on the up arrow to take us back to ground level then turn right times
No I don't see anything different in here do you
The only place I can think of that we haven't checked is out by that little pyramid that we couldn't do anything with before
Let's go check that
Go forward times then turn right
Click on the boat to get in it then go forward times to cross the lake and click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the left to get out of the boat
Now go forward times always clicking directly on the path
It sure makes me feel weird and very nervous to walk through these trees and hear those voices groans now that I know what's in them
You too
And I know that they're watching our every step
I just hope that they don't know what we're planning to do
Turn left once go forward once turn right once go forward once and turn right again
Aha
Something is different about that pyramid
That must have been what we turned
Let's get a closer look
Move forward once then click on the pyramid
It looks like an angel lighting something with a lamp I'm not sure but that looks like some kind of rocket that the angel is lighting
Is that a clue about something we have to do
Wait a minute
This pyramid has sides and we've only seen of them so far
I think we're going to have to turn that pillar downstairs more times to see what's on all sides so we know what to do
Click anywhere but on the pyramid to back away then turn right twice
Go forward once turn left once go forward once turn left again then go forward once to the step
Turn right move forward times on the path then turn left
Click on the boat to get in it go forward times to cross the lake then click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the right to get out of the boat
Go forward times to the elevator turn right twice then click on the button at the top of the pillar to go down
At the first level click on the down arrow to continue going down in the elevator
Turn right twice and go forward times
Click and drag the closed hand on the wheel to the right only once then let go
OK let's go see what the rd side of that pyramid has on it
Turn right then go forward times to the elevator and then click on the up button twice to go back up to ground level
Go forward times then turn right
Click on the boat to get in it then go forward times to cross the lake and click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the left to get out of the boat
Now go forward times always clicking directly on the path
Turn left once go forward once turn right once go forward once and turn right again
Go forward once and then click on the pyramid for a close up view
I was right
This picture IS different
But what does it mean
One angel painting another angel's wings
I'm sure it's a clue and that it has to be symbolic of some action that we take but I'm not sure what yet
I'm getting awfully tired of all this running back and forth but I guess we still need to see the th side
Maybe that will help make what we have to do clearer
Click anywhere but on the pyramid to back away then turn right twice
Go forward once turn left once go forward once turn left again then go forward once to the step
Turn right move forward times on the path then turn left
Click on the boat to get in it go forward times to cross the lake then click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the right to get out of the boat
Go forward times to the elevator turn right twice then click on the button at the top of the pillar to go down
At the first level click on the down arrow to continue going down in the elevator
Turn right twice and go forward times
Click and drag the closed hand on the wheel to the right only once then let go
Shortcut for the paragraph above Click the closed hand on the wheel and drag to the right exactly times
The following screenshots show the first sides of the pyramid
Side Angel with trees above wings Side Angel lighting rocket with lamp Side Angel painting wings on wingless angel OK let's go see what the th side of that pyramid has on it
Turn right then go forward times to the elevator and then click on the up button twice to go back up to ground level
Go forward times then turn right
Click on the boat to get in it then go forward times to cross the lake and click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the left to get out of the boat
Now go forward times always clicking directly on the path
Turn left once go forward once turn right once go forward once and turn right again
Go forward once and then click on the pyramid for a close up view
Hey that looks like one of the doors that we saw earlier on the first level underground
Does anything happen if we click on it
Let's see
Click on the drawing of the doors
It looks like they opened
Left Picture Doors closed
Right Picture Doors open You don't suppose that opened the doors down below do you
Let's go find out
Click anywhere except on the pyramid to back away then turn right twice
Go forward once turn left once go forward once turn left again then go forward once to the step
Turn right move forward times on the path then turn left
Click on the boat to get in it go forward times to cross the lake then click on the diagonal arrow pointing upward and to the right to get out of the boat
Go forward times to the elevator turn right twice then click on the button at the top of the pillar to go down one level
Look at that I was right
That door is open
Go forward times
It looks like a some kind of holy painting kind of like an angel without wings
Does anything happen if we click on it
No
Turn right once
What's this
An angel artist
Click on the paints
Hey we took its' paints
What are we supposed to do with these
Wait a minute
Didn't we see this angel on that small pyramid painting another angel's wings
Do you suppose we are to paint wings on that one we just looked at that has no wings
Let's try it
Turn left once then click the paints on the shoulders of the wingless angel
Look it has wings now
You were right
Those diagrams on the pyramid WERE clues evidently about some way that was prepared to get rid of those beings
OK lets put these paints back where we found them and see what else we can find
Turn right and then click the paints on the angel painting
Then turn left twice
Another angel with a burning lamp
Click on the lamp
OK we have the lamp and we know what we have to do with it the diagram on the small pyramid showed it lighting some kind of rocket but where
I don't see one here
Turn left once
It looks like that other door is open too
Go forward times
There's the rocket
Click the lamp on the opening in the rocket
OK it's lit but nothing happened
I don't see anything else here but there has to be a switch to throw or a button to push orsomething somewhere
Wait a minute
I remember now
There were those other buttons on that projector on the lower level
I couldn't understand the diagrams on them at the time but now that I think about it one had an angel on it and the other a diagram of this rocket
Einstein must have set this all up and then for some reason either chose not to do it or didn't have time to do it but he left all the information for the next Comer
Let's go put this lamp back and then go try those buttons
We'd better hurry
We don't want those beings to catch on to what we're trying to do
Click anywhere to back up then turn right and go forward times then turn left and click the lamp on the angel
OK the lamp is back where we found it
Turn left go forward times to the elevator turn left twice then click on the down arrow to descend to the lowest level
Go forward times turn right then go forward twice
Look at that
We were right
Both of those buttons are now blue green so everything must be ready to go
I'm very nervous are you
But we've GOT to get rid of those beings before they are used to replace humanity don't we
Yes
OK here goes
Click on the sun light symbol at the top
We did it
Look at that
I think they're all leaving
The Ending Now go back up in the elevator to ground level and walk outside
Notice how barren and desolate it looks with no trees anywhere and how sad and lonely it feels without even the sound of wind in the trees which we are so accustomed to
Yes we have successfully driven the more advanced species the beings of light from the world and have saved the human species from extinction or replacement
But at what price
What have we done
The trees are all gone here and the light beings with them
Are they gone everywhere or just here
We have saved humans but will man become less violent and survive or will he become increasingly more violent without the light beings' influence
And if the trees and light beings are gone everywhere how CAN humans survive
How dependent were we and our world on them
WHAT HAVE WE DONE
Commentary on the Ending by Kyle Choi author of Comer The credits were deliberately not shown at the end
They were always available from a pull down menu at the top of the screen but I didn't want them to interfere with the mood of the ending
I would consider the ending a success if when you return to the surface it arouses a mood of loss in you
Notice that sad and soft music accompanies the loss of the trees the loss of the light beings and the loss i e the ending of the game
You will have also noticed that all kinds of trees were everywhere in all of the sites in Comer
So obviously we love trees too
In other words I wanted the ending to be a solitary place where people could interpret and express what they have experienced by themselves
Actually we completed making the game with a feeling of sadness and loss and perhaps that is embedded in the ending of Comer
Commentary by Mr Bill We dearly love trees
After all we own a Plant Nursery
But it is interesting to speculate that if the human species is too violent and harmful to the earth and so is to be replaced with a species that already exists here as the story hypothesized what better choice could be made than trees
On the other hand it gives a whole new slant to Arbor Day doesn't it
It felt very strange to have a game with no real ending with no credits with everything deserted no trees no wind in the trees very sad music just you alone on a volcanic island in the middle of nowhere
Butthat's exactly how it would be if the story were real isn't it

When you survive this ordeal you can look at the receiver to track the flyer and get another map location Chemtron
But duck back into that storeroom and take a look around
Along the back wall there's three tins of paint and an iron bar
Take them
Try to leave would you believe it you're locked in
So pull the lever it should move the hook but it doesn't work
Something is blocking the overhead track so slide the ladder across and climb up to take a look
You see a pyramid shaped object dislodge it with the iron bar to get a strangely shaped key
Climb down and hang a paint tin from the hook
Pull the lever and it bashes the door
You'll need to do this with all three tins before you're free
Now that key you just found probably fits the strangely shaped Hapacom lock so head off to Hapacom and open the door
Search the boxes to find a delivery docket
It might be useful to get the explosives so back to the space station warehouse and stick it on the explosives box
Return to Hapacom and the box is ready and waiting for you
Take the explosive from box smart guyJand off to ChemtronUnlock the doors with the Chemtron Level keycard
Save game
Open the door and you'll be greeted and eaten by two electronic dogs if you walk in too far
What might gum up their works water
The huge syringe will come in handy but it needs a huge reservoir of water
Return to Rania's and fill it from the swimming pool
It won't work on it's own you need something else to attract the dogs so use it on the rubber duck to get a water filled duck
Back to Chemtron and drop the duck inside and watch the dogs attack it
They're no longer a problem
So cross the compound and open the next door with the Level card
Search around the warehouse and note the thinner wire to the right at the back
Use Level card again to open the door
Most of the boxes are protected by energy fields but there is one sample box
Open it and take the canister
Save game
If you open the door at the top of the stairs you will be shot
If you look at the canister more than once curtains
Walk around and check out the high up windows
One is partly open and there is something on the window ledge
Climb the girder and take the cutters watch the cut scene then you can use them to cut the wire at the back of the warehouse
Enter that enclosure and examine the lamp pole for a hint
Move it closer to the ventilation system
The only way to move it is by sheer force so use the dynamite with the bra and attach the detonator
Save game and get ready to move smartly
Attach the bra to the pole and head quickly run for the opposite back corner of the enclosure
In a cut scene you see the thugs alerted so don't venture too far
Climb the pole up to the ventilation outlet
There's a tricky hotspot here at the front corner of the outlet
Use the screwdriver on it then open the cover and crawl inside
At the end drop down the vent and watch cutscene as you free Tony
Note If you die here you haven't got the Ether
When you're back in control take the note from the desk drawer and read it Saidi is staying at the Plaza Hotel

ForewordFirst of all I want to thankAnima PPD Interactivefor making this excellent game
I know they worked very hard on this game for a couple of years
And I must say the result is an outstanding adventure
It would be the understatement of the year to call the game just not too easy
It's fair to say that it is quite difficult sometimes
But I think that that is what adventures are made for
And I also think that the puzzles in the game are quite logical and very well thought out
I also want to thank Anestis Kokkinidis of Anima PPD Interactive because he gave me a hint a few times to get me on track because I got stuck myself now and then
Credits are where credit is due
So thanks for that

The Crystal KeyLocation Oriented Experts WalkthroughWritten by John T Burt Copyright REVIEW Crystal Key is played like Myst and Journeyman Project
Explore all over by clicking from hot spot to hot spot and panning around looking for things to solve the puzzles as well as the puzzles themselves
Unlike Myst you can die if you do things out of sequence or forget something
The game is not as long or logical as Myst and often the logic of where to go next is not clear
Figuring out where to go next is The Major Puzzle in the game
Although I like using walkthroughs I recommend playing this game without a full walkthrough
Played without a walkthrough there will be a lot of blundering around but the length of play will be much greater
Either way the game is enjoyable and it was certainly worth the it cost me
ABOUT THIS FILE Figuring out where to go next is the major puzzle in this game
This help file does not tell you everyplace to go next
This file is a non specific list of things to find based on locations one location at a time
The locations are not entirely in play sequence but walkthrough can't help but give away some of the sequence
It should be minimal and not spoil the fun too much
TIPS GAME PURPOSE The purpose of the game was not clear to me and might help you
The purpose is to Kill Ozgar WHERE TO GO In general you have to complete exploring one world before starting on the next no matter where the game takes you
So if you are transported away from a world before you have looked at everything go back BRIGHTNESS Turn the brightness up
On my Macintosh G laptop it was damn dark
Sometimes I had no idea where I was going and what I was doing RECORDS Write down any obvious numbers colors lengths symbols and other patterns
They are often world coordinates or combinations ZOOM On the Macintosh you can ZOOM IN on something with the Shift Key and ZOOM OUT with the Control Key
It's pretty handy SAVED GAMES On the Mac you can save more than games by making a copy of the GMSV TAB file in the THE CRYSTAL KEY CONTENT folder before writing over old saved games
Use numbers in the saved game names to help keep track of where you are
All total I saved less than times

One route leads to an Arkonian ship and the other to an Ozgar shi pARKONIAN SHIP You need to release the clamps on the shuttle pick up a screwdriver inside and fly off
OZGAR SHIP DOOR The entrance pad is the little circle to the left
The correct pattern is supposed to have been visible at the start of the Mother ship but I didn't find it even though I tried three times
There are combinations to try
OZGAR SHIP STORAGE ROOM You should have recorded the combination to open the door on a previous similar ship
Figure out how to read the message and make note of the symbols on the screen
SUNKEN CITY you're actually still on the Jungle World I think GREEN DOME You need to unlock the desk and pick up the CD you'll get a portable portal too
Hint look at the paintings
LANDING PLATFORM You need to focus the mirrors on a hot spot so you can enter the tower
Tip move the control to the right first so you can see the circle of reflected light
DARK TOWER Be sure to pick up a shiny oval object inside
One button in the elevator works
TRAIN STATIONS
Just keep going until you reach the Portal Station
PORTAL STATION You need to find a Crystal Key fin
Tip when using the radio wait on each setting long enough to see if anything happens before trying the next setting
Warning the new portal location is the sun used for disposing of garbage
MOTHER SHIP CELL You will have to use the tool on a triangular metal panel a couple of times to get the door open
Hint there is a switch on top of the tool
PASSAGEWAYS Find a ladder take a couple of peaks at Ozgar note the keypad by his door and then find the hanger bay
HANGER BAY The elevator that will get you into the smaller ship is hard to see but it is there
SHIP Before flying off note the keypad code for the storage room door and the coordinates for the Mother ship
You'll have to decipher the number pad to figure it all out
OZGAR'S KEYPAD You need to use the holographic imager look down to find the place to plug it in the portable portal and the Abandon Ship code
END GAME
The alarms should go off and Ozgar should die

Click on the table The scroll will unroll and you will see new markings not earlier visible Note the symbols on the right margin Write them down Do they look familiar And doesn't this chart look like a floor plan of the Gatehouse Looks like there might be two floors each with a gray circular object at the lower right side That just might be a staircase Let's find it

Go back down to the fishbot FISHBOT BEACH Go up onto the beach then use your jetpack
Click on the Spaceport location PAD Go back down the elevator then back into the boat
Click on the Market location MARKET Go back to the produce merchant with his son under the tent
Take the kracklenut shell from your inventory then move it over either end of the produce in the stand until the cursor changes color then click Note You may have to do this twice to get information about the kracklenuts because the game likes to load the old conversation first
If the old conversation loads up just use your spacebar key several times until the conversation ends then try again
Place the kracklenut shell back into your inventory
Play the game again with the merchant's son Note A ha
There are those symbols again that we saw on the shields at the Merari Palace
The merchant's son tells you that the order the items appear on the game board is the same as how the warrior received them
When the puzzle comes with having to know this information knowing the order is vital
The proper order is
Gem
Dagger
Cup
Helmet
Lyre
Coin
And also note that the die is coded as red green and white
Knowing the values of the die is important to remember as well
Go back to the boat then click on the Pad location PAD Go back up the elevator move forward one screen use your jetpack then click on the Fishbot Beach location FISHBOT BEACH Go back into the fishbot MERARI PALACE Go upstairs to where Athera's lying in bed Note Okay it is now time to make sense of a puzzle we are about to attempt
The puzzle in mention is downstairs
It consists of six display cases
Each display case has three buttons on it
You need to click the correct order of buttons on each display case to reveal a map
The corresponding maps of each display case coupled with the order of the items on the game board back at the market will show us how to solve the puzzle
To complete the puzzle we will need to click on the correct order of maps around the column in the center of the room
As for the shields in the room where Athera is lying Pan around the room and notice that all six of the shields have three parts a left panel a central panel and a right panel Note You will see that the shields are colored differently from one another
Recall back from the game you played with the merchant's son that red green and white
When doing the puzzle each display case will have three buttons
Each shield has three panels
The left panel of the shield represents the left button of the display case
The right panel the right button and the left panel the left button
So Helmet left middle right Gem left middle right Dagger left middle right Cup left middle right Lyre left middle right Coin left middle right
These values correspond to the display case buttons of the puzzle and shows how many times for each display case you need to press the buttons
However the order of how they are to be pressed is a guessing game but the codes have been solved in this walkthrough
Go back downstairs then move one screen down the hallway
Pan right then click on the door Note Okay here it is
It is puzzle time
There are two display cases on each wall where there isn't a door
There are the maps around the column in the middle of the room
The order of the display cases can be solved anyway you like but the maps have to be pressed in a specific order as shown to us back on the game board at the market
Gem
Dagger
Cup
Helmet
Lyre
Coin
If the maps are not pressed in this order you will not solve this puzzle
Click on the column in the middle of the room Note To solve the display cases for this walkthrough I will begin with the right hand side of the room and work my way counterclockwise Cup rdmap to press Coin thmap to press Helmet thmap to press Gem stmap to press Dagger ndmap to press Lyre thmap to press Note Looking at the column as if you had just entered into the room from the hallway for ease of explanation number the maps through
The map directly in front of you is map then count forward moving to the right or counterclockwise

You are Call
See Evany Call's world and hear about the entranced inhabitants after the time of Ozgar's Balial regime
Call's parents disappeared one day and left him alone
A portal opens and a woman appears
She is taken by guards
What is going on
Evany Look around at the empty street
Go forward to the inactive portal
Look down and pick upAthera's diary Athera's diary Click the button at top left of the frame and read the log
While at the portal relay station she found a crashed ship from the fourth quadrant of the Maradyne sector
She went to the museum and learned of Colonel Lifeson's heroic act
It was Lifeson's ship that she found
Her quest is to find a cause of the colonist's symptoms

All active locations will be seen and when clicked can automatically go to that location
Some locations are accessed only during the night and some only during the day The Diary The diary holds Phoenix's thoughts
Items written in red are to suggest things you still need to resolve
When resolved the notes rsquo auto change into black writing
Contacts This is a list of characters known to Phoenix
By clicking on a name in the list their info appears in a box on the right side of the screen
You can call them by clicking on what looks like a cell tower on the top of the info frame
Game Controls Here is the in game menu where you find Save Game Load Game and audio video options
Saves There are game save slots which are generous but I used during one game play however you have the ability to overwrite saves
The saves are titled by the date and time and ordered by number a picture identifies the location on screen when load save is accessed
Character Contact The politically correct to the extreme society will allow our heroine to interview citizens only once a day
They are questioned at a minimum of two visits while some take up to four or five
This is dependant on any previous actions and dialogues chosen Once locations are opened within the map game play becomes highly nonlinear and can be resolved through different paths
But caution must be used because many characters locations and events depend upon triggers to provide access to another source of investigation
Office PC This is on Phoenix's desk and will be used frequently with inventory items to analyze objects and clues picked up along the way
Movement Double left mouse click makes Phoenix run
A right click will bypass conversations
A good feature if you have to replay a section due to some mistake you can skip past long conversations
Be warned changing camera angles can confuse your sense of direction at times
Though it can be frustrating at times there are no action scenes such as Broken Sword
You can take your time through the game without time pressure
The game is divided into days because this is a nonlinear game days are not measured by completing specific task
You may recall Gabriel Knight Sins of the Fathers where days ended when a specific task was met
You could not move to the next day if you missed just one of the triggers
Culpa Innata has no such restriction
Some days you will get many things done other days very little
It does not matter what direction you choose for the day
Its nonlinear design can allow you to miss things entirely and still complete the game that's nice but it can also be a problem some people like to be held to a schedule
I never did figure out the timing in regard to how long a day last I've had Phoenix go home at pm on some days and on others she was still at the office at pm
Go figure then she goes out at night sometimes for work and sometimes for play
Unlike other game heroines after a hard day at work she insists upon changing her clothes before going out
The opening cut scene details a doomsday scenario and then transitions to an immigrant graduation
But don't worry we don't face doomsday just yet
You certainly do not have to follow the step by step direction of this walkthrough to complete the game
In fact you can deviate from it quite a bit
There are numerous avenues to take to complete the game
You just need to be mindful of the triggers
For instance you cannot complete theAnti Chaos Letter Puzzle the entrance to the underground before you complete the five kiosk puzzles
You also can't go to certain places or get certain things until you learn about them through other actions triggers
The nonlinear aspect may offer freedom praised by many but it comes at a price
With wide latitude you could likely miss something and go backtracking a long way to figure where that trigger was Walkthrough This is only one way through the game
There are many others
Feel free to deviate
The photos are screenshots and used sparingly but ones that appear essential to give a clue in regard as to what your finished puzzle should look like

It attaches to the bottom of the piece that is placed at the top left side of the left fork of the Y When completed a blinking image appears Exit the computer
Travel becomes easier as we no longer have to go to the metro
Open your PA to select the map and click on the Pyramid
The map should expand to show areas of the Pyramid you can visit select the Thing Store
Remember the GPSN rule about limitations for interviewing people
You can ask anything in the conversation tree but to get the information you need you have to be selective otherwise you may have to wait until the next day for a second interview to get the trigger to advance the game
For instance your interview at the Thing Store the first time there is with Alicia Cordoba
From her you need the names of other sales girls Monica and Piper
You will also need to learn about the Peace Officer impersonator Harry Callahan and construct a picture of him
At the Thing store you will visit Bogdanov's office and a kiosk across the street from the store
Thing Store Anti Chaos Poster and kiosk Click Pyramid and then select the Thing Store in the map
Exit the Thing store and go across the street
Look close at the Anti Chaos poster and the kiosk beside it
The poster has on it
Look at the kiosk and enter the number
See the fourth line change to Truth is never linear
As you examine the kiosk they appear on your map
Now go into the Thing Store
Alicia Cordoba First visit Talk to the female sales clerk in blue gray uniform Alicia Cordoba
Learn about Harry Callahan a Peace Officer impersonator
When Phoenix asks Alicia to describe Harry a picture will appear on your screen
You can call this the Suspect modeling Puzzle Click a feature of the face and then click 'compare'
Alicia will say if is not or is a match
Once the face matches you can select another feature of the face
For best results it is best to stay with one feature until Alicia says it is a match
The features you can alter are hair eyes nose mouth and chin
Alicia's answers will progress through these changes
She will say ldquo from slightly like him rdquo ldquo moderately like him rdquo ldquo more like him rdquo ldquo very much like him rdquo When all features are correctly done she will say ldquo that is exactly him rdquo When Alicia says quot That is exactly like him rdquo click the Reconstruct Button to see a picture of the impersonator
The picture is added to your inventory
Continue to ask Alicia about Bogdanov's death and learn about the other sales clerk Piper and Monica

Bogdanov's office First Visit Go down the steps and walk to right screen
Check the Thing Store elevator
Use the swipe card taken from the bar at the apartment Look around the room
Bogdanov's HDI score is
Look close at the one sided Rubik rsquo s cube at a side table
Solve the puzzle by making all squares yellow similar to the center one
I did this by using random clicking to change the squares It did not take very long
Phoenix will look at the completed Rubik's cube again and note that there's a familiar pattern to the cube
The top row contains all white squares a middle row contains all blue squares and the bottom row contains all red squares
This is a duplicate of the Russian Flag
Note this was the clue that would tell you how to solve the Mata Hari Safe puzzle back at the apartment
Look at the old book on the table an album of photographs

These are triggers to add new destinations to the map
After talking with Anderson I intended to take Phoenix home as it was late in the day however she received an automatic call on her PA requesting that she interview an Immigrant and she was swept to the office
These incidents are sometimes triggered by specific events but sometimes they are random
Don rsquo t be alarmed if they occur at points different in your game play
GPSN Offices Immigrant Interviews Talk to Ingrid head of the Immigration Academy in blue standing on the left
Click the different panels on the table to see what they are
The one on the right is the neuro impulse locator which shows if the person is being truthful
The one on the left is the security coefficient indicator it detects lies and reduces points
If the score goes below the applicant fails
Interview Raj Patel Talk to the Raj and watch the graph and the bar of the computer system
Ask about his past and plans
Scrutinize his past
If you ask him about his participation in the riots and about his acts during the riots
Raj Patel fails
If the questions asked focuses on his action after the riots Patel will pass
It is best that he fails

It has been a long day
Click on your navigation map and you will see there is no location box for Phoenix's home if you have not been there yet

When you go home change clothes and click the map to meet with Sandra automatically
You can gossip with her or ask to go home
These meetings happen several times and they are simply small talk you can cut them short if you wish to do so
Start day two by checking your diary
If you are following this walkthrough there should be four red printed items
A reference questioning the butterfly images
You have three images and need four to solve this puzzle so this must wait a bit
The Anti Chaos Kiosk questions this too will wait a bit
The imposter question who is he
If you try to research it by going through the census info on your PA Phoenix will say quot I don't need to do this yet quot
For me I had to wait until the boss scolded her out for not doing it
Then the census search was triggered but it had no info
You suspect he may belong to the military but you cannot access that screen
So this too waits for later
That leaves the people triggered by the meeting with the lawyer

This should be your last visit to the CDC
Thing Store Piper First Visit Go to the back area of the left side of the store and talk to Piper
Approach her harshly
It is too bad but you could not drag her out in handcuffs
Oh well before you get too far you are interrupted by the message your PA has been hacked and are transported to the office
The first contact with Piper appears to be the trigger that generates the PA hacking message as it occurred each time I reached this point in the game
I had taken different routes to this contact in each playing
PA Hacker Puzzle Get an urgent message on PA Hackers got into the system and paid particular attention to Phoenix' folders
Check your PA and see a hacker data file
Use the computer
Select Data Processing and then Image Processing on the second screen
Remain on the computer and right click to pull up your PA
The last item in your inventory should be the hacker data file
Highlight this file and click on the gear icon Click the hacker data file on the frame and the return message you receive will be quot File corrupted rdquo Hexadecimal Editor This editor appears automatically after the quot File Corrupted quot report
See several red Question marks that are needed to be decoded
The hacker replaced letters and numbers with question marks
You need to replace the question mark with the correct number or letter
The screen shot below shows the correct sequence of numbers and letters
To solve this puzzle you need to start with a group of four that hasonered question mark
Each click will advance the number or letter by one space such as a to b to c or I to to etc
When you select the correct digit the entire group of will turn blue
Continue on until all the groups of four with a single red question mark are decoded With groups of four that have question marks the process is more difficult
Because the group will not turn blue until all four digits are correct
So you have no way to determine where to set the first question mark
But there is help look at the above picture
Change the question marks to the corresponding number or letter you see in the same location in the picture
It will not change to blue until the second question mark in that group of is changed
Once the second question mark in the group is changed then that group of will turn blue
Once all the red marks are changed to blue the image will change to a picture similar to the one you obtained in a previous puzzle
You now have the th image

Phoenix's Office after getting translation table
Use the computer and select Decryption Place the Cyrillic handwritten text on the right frame and the translation table on the left frame
Translate each letter by clicking the appropriate English letter on the left and click the Cyrillic letter on the right
After translation is completed get Bogdanov's name list in inventory
This can be tedious as sometimes the letters do not become hot when your curser highlights them
I found if you click the back button then return to the screen it magically works again
To make it easier here is a list of how the names should read
Phoenix will comment if you got them right in the end
Also note when you change the letter in one name all like letters in other names change as well
So you will not have to change every letter
Be careful as some of the Cyrillic letters appear close to the English which may make it easy to miss one
If you miss one it will likely be a headache to discover which wrong one holds up solving this puzzle
After exiting the computer automatically report to Chief Morssen
Report about the Cyrillic handwritten text number and Bogdanov's name list
Was solving this puzzle a trigger to generate the report

Open the panel
In a sense this is a different take on the old maze puzzle
There are big lights at top right and top left
At bottom right is a button with a green light showing that power comes through it
The aim of the puzzle is to make connection from bottom right to top right and another connection from bottom right to top left
Press the button on the right to see how the power goes through the lines
Treat this as two separate puzzles
You cannot send the power to both top lights at the same time First you have to route the power to the top light on either side
Once the first top light is lit that light stays on
Then reroute the line so the power travels to the other top light
Now both lights are on
See the small bulbs in the path Each color light sends the flow in a different direction
You change the color by clicking on a particular light
The directions are as follows Blue down Red up Green right Yellow left
I found the best way to do this is to press the green start button and watch the flow of the power
Change lights one at a time to direct the flow
When both top lights are on take a breath and watch
The boulder walls open and then you can walk Phoenix down the tracks to the elevator
Press the button on right side she will step in and the unsafe elevator will deliver her to her bed

Video Processing Click the arrow and the machine will search acquire and lose the frames
You get a Processing error
The machine recovers the viable frames but they are separated
Reconstruct the frames manually
The big frame above is used to reconstruct the frames
Note this is rather difficult determining which pieces go together
Once you have all the pieces together you need to know what the picture is supposed to look like to have a chance of placing them properly in the square
Here is what the picture is supposed to look like

Make a focused colored frame
A focused frame is made up of two frames from the bottom bar
Simply put you are to locate two similar frames put them together to make a complete frame You have loose frames in the bottom scroll bar with which you need to make complete frames
Think of each as a half of the frame
You place one frame in the large box and search the lower scroll bar to find its other half If they match the screen will state 'Field Match' and if they don't match the screen will state' Field does not match' Separate mismatched frames on the top frame by clicking one off the other and placing it on a blank space on the big frame or it will go back to the bottom bar
When all frames are matched and in color arrange the frames to make a scene of the plane crash
The computer will then analyze the picture frame by frame
See a frame of illegal tobacco on the ground spilled from the crash
Click the cigarette frame to continue the scan until completed Chief Morssen's Office Phoenix reports about the illegal tobacco

THE CURSE OF CROWLEY MANOR is the second in the series of quot Other Ventures quot from Adventure International
Like the others there is a minimum of description and clues in the rooms through which you travel
This walkthrough will examine all the locations and objects even if they aren't instrumental in solving the game
That way you'll get the whole flavour of the adventure
Part I You start in a large office with some furniture and a closed door to the east
You might as well have a look around because you can't do anything including leave the room until the telephone rings and you answer it
So type lt I gt for inventory and have a LOOK AT the objects that you are carrying
You can't EXAMINE anything you can only LOOK
LOOK AT THE CALENDAR and NAMEPLATE on the desk and have a LOOK OUT the window
Now you know who and where you are
You're Inspector Black of Scotland Yard in London on the night of April
Finally the telephone rings and you ANSWER it
Officer Strade tells you to get to CROWLEY MANOR because there has been a murder
Now you can OPEN THE DOOR to the east and when you do you find yourself on a landing with a hallway heading south
GO SOUTH lt S gt and you will end up on a brick street in front of Scotland Yard
If you LOOK AT THE STREET you will discover that a hansom cab is parked there and the driver is smiling at you
This looks promising so GO TO THE CAB
Note that in some versions of the game you cannot quot GO TO THE CAB quot you must quot CLIMB IN quot
If you TALK the friendly driver will ask you where you are going
Why CROWLEY MANOR of course
You will find that throughout the game typing TALK or LISTEN will elicit information that will help you to solve the mystery
LOOK AT THE DRIVER and you will find a small VIAL
GET THE VIAL it's HOLY WATER and will come in handy later
While the cab is driving through the streets of London have a LOOK as you pass some familiar landmarks and eventually pull into the driveway that leads into CROWLEY MANOR
GET OUT of the cab and the driver will tell you that he has taken of your shillings
You are on the porch and if you LOOK you will see Police Inspector Harbour
TALK and he will tell you that the body is in the kitchen and Officer Strade is inside
CLIMB THE STEPS and you will end up in the plush entry hall which contains a large locked cabinet
From now on you should type LOOK when you enter a room and it will list the contents
When you type LOOK AT a specific object you will get some of the details that are included in this walkthrough
Now's the time to get rid of some of the baggage that you don't need Drop the I D
CARD and the SHILLINGS
If you were to quit or get killed you would be returned to your office with all possessions intact
To get back to CROWLEY MANOR you would need your money with you but since this won't happen you don't need to lug it around
GO WEST lt W gt and then lt S gt
This is the elegant music room lined with old portraits
They stare at you with fiendish inhuman eyes
You find an old victrola and a piano
LOOK AT THE VICTROLA and you will see the crank
Try turning the crank
Hmmm it's stuck
Have a LOOK AT THE CRANK and you will find a GOLD KEY
You don't need the GOLD KEY to solve the adventure but take it anyway
Now the crank is unstuck and you can TURN it
LISTEN
Ahhh MOZART
Go lt N gt twice into the dimly lit room
A small figure huddles in the dark but you can't see much
The figure is on the floor
TALK to him
It is DAVONN and NO MAN has murdered his master
GO EAST lt E gt into the study
It's full of old books and a desk
There is a silver book on the desk which you can READ Note that some versions of the game require you to quot READ quot twice
You learn that quot the demon quot is trapped in the house
Brrrrr
Open the desk and get the CRYSTAL BALL
Go lt W gt you will find Davonn has been cruelly murdered
lt S gt and lt E gt
If you want unlock the large locked cabinet with the GOLD KEY
Officer Strade falls out
Now you have a personal stake in finding the demon of CROWLEY MANOR
Drop the GOLD KEY and GO EAST
You are at the south end of a long hall
If you LOOK you will find a statue which turns out to be a WHITE ELEPHANT
It is so forget about it
GO NORTH again
You are in the centre of the hall
A tremendous force thrusts you against the wall and there is a hideous smell
This only happens if you LOOK
Without doing so it would be a rather dull adventure indeed
GO NORTH again to the north end and CLIMB THE STAIRWAY there
You are in the kitchen
Blood splatters the walls and floor but there is no body
If you LOOK again you will discover a brown slimey GROWTH on the floor
GET THE GROWTH and GO WEST into the exquisite dining room
There is a china cabinet which you cannot open and a marble table here
LOOK AT THE OAK TABLE
You must do this to discover the delicious looking FOOD
DROP THE GROWTH and LOOK
It slides over to the plate devours the food and begins to grow
LOOK again
The GROWTH shoots under the china cabinet which falls over with a crash
What have we here
A LETTER OPENER and a HAND AXE
Get Them both
Return to the parlor lt E gt lt S gt lt S gt lt S gt lt W gt lt W gt
Here you will find a Rosewood chest screwed shut
But you have a LETTER OPENER
UNSCREW THE SCREWS and OPEN THE CHEST
You will find a CRUCIFIX and an OLD NOTE
Get Them
When you read the note you will see that it says quot quot
Remember this and drop the OLD NOTE and the LETTER OPENER
Go back to the dining room lt E gt lt E gt lt N gt lt N gt lt CLIMB STAIRS gt lt W gt
GO NORTH to the food pantry
A closed door is to the east
OPEN THE DOOR and you will be in a short E W hall
GO EAST to the small storage room
If you LISTEN you will hear a noise behind the plywood wall
CHOP A HOLE IN THE WALL WITH THE AXE
CLIMB THROUGH THE HOLE
You are in a darkened room with scientific instruments
LOOK and a tremendous voice will boom out quot YOU HAVE NOT THE POWER TO FACE ME YET
BE WARNED quot Wow the plot thickens
Part II COLLECTING THE WEAPONS LOOK AT THE SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
There is an ancient book here
READ THE BOOK and you will learn that quot GAFALA ALONE CAN HELP quot Who is GAFALA
You'll GO WEST to the musty room
There is a door here with a numeral lock
Luckily you have sacraments CRUCIFIX and HOLY WATER or an icy creature would appear and kill you
SET THE DIAL TO the number on the OLD NOTE
The door will click
OPEN THE DOOR
You are in a damp brick walled room
There is a horrible stench
LOOK several times A powerful force slams you against the wall
Something screams
You are thrown flat on the floor
A voice bellows quot SOON YOU'LL BE MINE
quot The room cools and fills with smoke
Your crucifix is red hot
An evil smelling smoke drifts through the room
It forms frightening shapes
This is getting exciting isn't it
CLIMB THE STAIRWAY that lies to the east
You are at the south end of a N S hall
Sound familiar
GO NORTH twice then lt W gt through the doorway
You are in a stark room of red brick
This appears to be a dead end
Time to call in the reinforcements
Type GAFALA
A wall falls and a voice shouts quot I AM HERE quot LOOK
The west wall has collapsed revealing a stairway
CLIMB THE STAIRWAY
You are in a brilliant crystal room
A towering figure of white stands in the centre
A glowing mist surrounds the figure
TALK TO GAFALA
You learn that he is the evil demon's brother and that two paths leave the room to the north and the south
It's a good thing that you had GAFALA to help you because there's no indication of any exits from this room
GO SOUTH to the east end of an E W hall
GO WEST to the crypt
If you LOOK you will discover that THE HORROR IS HERE THE DEMON
It screams quot WHERE IS YOUR WEAPON MAGGOT quot Well it seems that you need to arm yourself
Whatever you do don't LOOK again or you will end up back in the darkened room with DAVONN
This wouldn't be the end of the world but you would have to retrace your steps
GO WEST to the dim shimmering room
A ghostly figure sits at a piano
It resembles the portraits back in the music room
TALK and it will tell you that it knows one composer and will play if you name him
Know any composers
How about MOZART
Sure enough the figure plays and a stairway appears to the north
CLIMB THE STAIRWAY
Oh oh another apparent dead end
This is a large deserted room with nothing in view
Luckily you DO have five senses
LISTEN and you will hear a noise above your head
LOOK UP and then CLIMB THE ROPE you see hanging from the ceiling
You are in a damp musty passage with a rope hanging through a hole in the floor
Why not have a LOOK
Sure enough a GOLD SHIELD appears
GET THE GOLD SHIELD
If you look again you will notice a light to the east
GO EAST
You are in a great silver room with a circular depression on the floor
I'll bet you're carrying something that would fit that perfectly
DROP THE CRYSTAL BALL and LOOK
You see a vision of a sword and a beautiful fountain
LOOK again and a magic SWORD will appear
GET THE SWORD and return to the crystal room where GAFALA is lt W gt lt CLIMB DOWN ROPE gt lt S gt lt E gt If you like have a look when you get to the crypt and you will find a SILVER CLUB and half decayed corpses on the floor
Don't bother with either
Just for fun GO NORTH LOOK and GO SOUTH
Keep going to the crystal room lt E gt lt N gt
Part III CHASING THE DEMON Now take the other path NORTH lt twice gt and you will find yourself in a wide dark smelly pit
A low wailing moan permeates the darkness
LISTEN
BUT IS IT CLEANSED quot Hmmm something else to keep in mind
CLIMB THE STAIRWAY to the north
You are in a stone room strewn with bones
A huge ugly rat is here
Unfortunately you can't kill the rat until it removes a chunk of flesh from your arm
Don't do anything but LOOK
It will oblige you and you can KILL THE RAT WITH THE REVOLVER
If you try to use any other weapon it will rip out your throat
OPEN THE DOOR to the west and you will be in a smelly dirt pit with fungus growing on the walls
A stairway to the north is blocked by wooden beams
CHOP THE BEAMS WITH THE AXE and then you can CLIMB THE STAIRS
You are in a very eerie black walled chamber
Strange magical runes are drawn on the floor
A ghost like image of GAFALA is here
TALK TO GAFALA and he will give you some important advice quot YOU HAVE BUT ONE MOMENT TO STRIKE
STRIKE ONLY THEN quot Now comes a rather annoying part of the game
There is no indication of any other exit from the room except the golden doorway to the north
If you GO SOUTH you will end up back in the pit
Yet you must GO EAST
Here you will find a brilliant green room with a beautiful fountain
It flows with green liquid and energy waves
CLEANSE THE SWORD in the fountain
You will be rewarded with a surge of power and a low moan from the north
If you hadn't gone east and cleansed your sword than all would be lost
Rather a significant thing to leave hidden away isn't it
Note that in some graphic versions of the game the doorway to the east is visible in the picture Return to the eerie chamber and through the golden doorway lt W gt lt N gt
You end up in a gigantic cavern stretching out of sight to the east and west and filled with a sickening odor
Just head straight NORTH to the Gates of Hell
IT IS UPON YOU
LOOK several times The demon hurls you through the air
Your body slams against a wall
Your face is red hot from the heat of its breath
It howls quot THANK YOU FOR DROPPING IN FOOL quot It slams you into a small passage and laughs quot YOU'VE BEEN DUPED
YOU CAN'T KILL ME quot Your body shakes with convulsions as the demon tries to crush you but you are shielded
It touches your white hot sword and screams with pain
Good thing you cleansed it or you wouldn't have gotten even this far
It belches a sheet of flame which engulfs your body
You're getting a little perturbed but you're biding your time
The demon stares into your face
quot JOIN ME SPAWN OF DIRT AND SHARE THE POWER THAT IS MINE quot The time has come
Without further ado KILL THE DEMON WITH THE SWORD
Your CRT explodes with light
Congratulations
You have defeated the demon of CROWLEY MANOR

Go to your inventory and examine the BOOK
It's the quot A Mmmm C's of Ventriloquism quot Now take a look at the coat hanging next to the door
First open the pocket and take the GLOVE
Then look at the coat's shoulder to discover some unsightly DANDRUFF Pick up the DANDRUFF It's not dandruff it's ewwwww
LICE Now go to the right and talk to the ACTOR
His name is Slappy Cromwell and he actually knows someone who knows how to get to Blood Island
Grill him for info then move on to Go to the vanity and pick up the MAGIC WAND
Use the MAGIC WAND with the MAGIC HAT
Presto
Pick up the BOOK in the MAGIC HAT
Go to your inventory and examine the BOOK
It's the quot A Mmmm C's of Ventriloquism quot
Now take a look at the coat hanging next to the door
First open the pocket and take the GLOVE
Then look at the coat's shoulder to discover some unsightly DANDRUFF Pick up the DANDRUFF It's not dandruff it's ewwwww
LICE
Now go to the right and talk to the ACTOR
His name is Slappy Cromwell and he actually knows someone who knows how to get to Blood Island
Grill him for info then move on to The Barbary CoastGetting the ScissorsThat's quite a snazzy pair of scissors in the ceiling above the barber
Problem is that the barber isn't just going to give them to you First you've got to get his snooty customer Captain Rottingham out of the chair
Watch how the barber keeps sitting his comb down and looking away at a book When the COMB is on the table use the LICE on the COMB Now that the barber chair is free talk to the barber and introduce yourself
The barber's name is Haggis McMutton
Ask him for a haircut and you'll take a seat in his chair
When he looks at his book use the HANDLE on the barber chair once to lift the chair slightly The next time Haggis looks away Pick up the PAPERWEIGHT on the book
Guybrush will knock it away with his toe sending Haggis off to look for another paperweight Now's your chance
Use the HANDLE to raise the chair several times until you reach the ceiling then grab the SCISSORS Getting the Jawbreaker from Cuthroat BillThat Jawbreaker is gonna come in super handy later
To get it push Bill
He'll begin choking on it so do the Guybrush Threepwood maneuver on him and push him again
The JAWBREAKER will fall to the floor Getting Edward quot Snugglecakes quot VanHelgen to Join the CrewEdward wants a captain who can sufficiently insult him and then best him in duel Use your GLOVE and give him a good slap just like in the movies Edward will take you to the battlefield When he shows you the three open pistol cases don't select any of them If you do he will ALWAYS beat you in the pistol duel
Instead look at the middle gun box and then specifically at the BOX LID
Close the BOX LID and choose the BANJO CASE behind the pistol cases
You're about to try Dueling Banjos
It's recommended that you get a piece of paper and pencil for this one When Edward plucks several strings in succession he's going to pause momentarily and pluck one individual note
You'll need to remember which note he plucked because you'll have to repeat everything he does
The easiest way is this there are five strings
Think of the top string as the next as and so on down tofive
Whenever he plucks a single note write it down Also it's helpful to write them one on top of the next so you don't lose your place when playing the notes back It's random which strings you get but you'll always get three rounds For example here's one of my Banjo Duels R R R Even though you've proved you can rock with the rest of the pirates Edward is just a bit too good for his own good
While he brings the house down walk to the GUN PILE pick up a PISTOL and in the good name of sportsmanship fire at Eddie VanHelgen's Banjo That will win his respect
And it's just then that you realize he may be the father of a long line of infamous guitarists

After going through the gratuitous Grim Fandango promo remove the SERRATED BREAD KNIFE from the skeleton's back Getting the Club Membership Card If you've talked to the Cabana Boy on the beach you know you can't get into the club without a membership card
And if you've talked to Longbeard about it he'll tell you he lost his membership card while cooking
That GROSS CHICKEN on the table is probably to blame
Use the MAGGOTS on the GROSS CHICKEN to find the MEMBERSHIP CARD Longbeard mentioned wanting something crunchy to chew on so give him the JAWBREAKER you got from Cuthroat Bill
That will loosen his Gold Tooth
Now he carves something chewy so give him a piece of GUM
Longbeard will blow bubbles making his loose Gold Tooth an obvious sillohuette in each bubble
When he blows a bubble use the PIN on it to pop it and send the Gold Tooth to the floor
Pick up the GOLD TOOTH and go into you inventory Longbeard won't let you leave with his gold tooth so you'll have to sneak it out
In you inventory chew the GUM
A gum wad appears in your inventory
Use the tooth with the CHEWED GUM Inhale the HELIUM BALLOON then chew the CHEWED GUM and GOLD TOOTH
This will send a helium filled gum bubble floating out the open window above the door gold tooth safely hidden inside When you get outside search the MUDPUDDLE to the left of Longbeard's door with the PIE PAN
Finally bring the GOLD TOOTH to Cuthroat Bill Getting Haggis McMutton to Join the CrewHaggis wants you to defeat him in a test of strength the Caber Toss If you've never seen this before it's basically tossing heavy tree trunks end over end
The chances of Guybrush being able to lift even one end is slim
Time to cheat Go to the duelling field in Puerto Pollo go through the arch to the right of the Theater
Go to the right and use your BISCUIT CUTTER on the RUBBER TREE
This will give you a rubber plug which you'll use in the boat in Danjer Cove Go the Grassy Knoll
Use the SERRATED BREAD KNIFE with the SAW HORSE
The Keg o Rum will roll into the tree and break leaving a rather convenient flammable trail in its wake
Whip out that BURNING EMBER and light the TRAIL OF RUM
This send that Rubber Tree onto the Pile of Cabers you'll be using in your caber toss with Haggis
Now all you've got to do is ask Haggis to compete with you and you've got your whole crew Getting the ScissorsThat's quite a snazzy pair of scissors in the ceiling above the barber
Problem is that the barber isn't just going to give them to you First you've got to get his snooty customer Captain Rottingham out of the chair
Watch how the barber keeps sitting his comb down and looking away at a book When the COMB is on the table use the LICE on the COMB
Now that the barber chair is free talk to the barber and introduce yourself
The barber's name is Haggis McMutton
Ask him for a haircut and you'll take a seat in his chair
When he looks at his book use the HANDLE on the barber chair once to lift the chair slightly The next time Haggis looks away Pick up the PAPERWEIGHT on the book
Guybrush will knock it away with his toe sending Haggis off to look for another paperweight Now's your chance
Use the HANDLE to raise the chair several times until you reach the ceiling then grab the SCISSORS Getting the Jawbreaker from Cuthroat BillThat Jawbreaker is gonna come in super handy later
To get it push Bill
He'll begin choking on it so do the Guybrush Threepwood maneuver on him and push him again
The JAWBREAKER will fall to the floor Getting Edward quot Snugglecakes quot VanHelgen to Join the CrewEdward wants a captain who can sufficiently insult him and then best him in duel Use your GLOVE and give him a good slap just like in the movies Edward will take you to the battlefield When he shows you the three open pistol cases don't select any of them If you do he will ALWAYS beat you in the pistol duel
Instead look at the middle gun box and then specifically at the BOX LID
Close the BOX LID and choose the BANJO CASE behind the pistol cases
You're about to try Dueling Banjos
It's recommended that you get a piece of paper and pencil for this one When Edward plucks several strings in succession he's going to pause momentarily and pluck one individual note
You'll need to remember which note he plucked because you'll have to repeat everything he does
The easiest way is this there are five strings
Think of the top string as the next as and so on down tofive
Whenever he plucks a single note write it down Also it's helpful to write them one on top of the next so you don't lose your place when playing the notes back It's random which strings you get but you'll always get three rounds
For example here's one of my Banjo Duels Even though you've proved you can rock with the rest of the pirates Edward is just a bit too good for his own good
While he brings the house down walk to the GUN PILE pick up a PISTOL and in the good name of sportsmanship fire at Eddie VanHelgen's Banjo That will win his respect
And it's just then that you realize he may be the father of a long line of infamous guitarists
Hmmmm Getting Cuthroat Bill to Join the CrewYou will need a piece of treasure in order to lure Bill onto the crew That piece of treasure is a GOLD TOOTH which is found in the Chicken Restaurant next to the lemonade stand
See below
Getting a Reservation Slip to Longbeard's ChickenNow that you've got the scissors go to the lemonade stand and use the SCISSORS on the MYSTERIOUS FLOWERS to the right of the vats If you've examined the FLOWERS use the SCISSORS on the IPECAC FLOWERS

Use the IPECAC FLOWER with the PANCAKE SYRUP to make IPECAC SYRUP
Then use the IPECAC SYRUP with the SNAKE HEAD Once expelled you can use the RESEVATION SLIP for Longbeard's Chicken that you just got out of the Snake's tummy
But first Getting Out of the QuicksandPick up the THORN from the THORNY PLANT in front of you
To your right pick up a REED
Now go into your inventory and combine the THORN with the REED to create a PEA SHOOTER
Then combine the PAPERWEIGHT with the HELIUM BALLOON Blow on the balloon to send it floating to the vine to the left
Finally use the PEA SHOOTER on the balloon and grab the LIFE SAVING VINE

Pick up the EGG and return to the Hotel and give the EGG PEPPER and SMELLY DOG HAIR to the Bartender
Suddenly he's a happy bartender by the name of Griswold Goodsoup who gives you the rest of his HANGOVER REMEDY
The cap is on really tight so use the CHISEL on the HANGOVER REMEDY HEAD B CLEAR to remove it Talk to him about the resort his family business and the Lost Diamond

When he slaps it down on the counter add some HEAD B CLEAR to the drink and slug it down
Papapeashu
Even though you aren't really dead the gravedigger will throw you into a crypt
Nuts it isn't a Goodsoup crypt
Ah well You're in the coffin in the lower right
Use the CHISEL on the COFFIN LID to get out
Those nails sure look handy
Take each of the NAILS from the coffin you just got out of Creepy
You're just going to have to deal with the undead since you're locked in here
Use the CHISEL on the COFFIN in the middle of the room
OH NO
Remember Stan from MI
You locked him in there a while back Walk out of the crypt toward the hotel then straight back to the Cemetery
Stan has magically transformed the dreary dusty crypt into a dreary neon lit Life Insurance office
Buy a LIFE INSURANCE POLICY under the Goodsoup name by giving Stan the GOLD TOOTH
Also take the LAMINATED BUSINESS CARD from Stan Getting into the Locked Room Part Continued Go to the second floor of the Hotel and use the LAMINATED BUSINESS CARD on the locked DOOR In the Locked Room Part Continued Pull down the BED
Use the COFFIN NAILS on the BED to keep it held down
Nail it down for sure with the single NAIL that used to hold the portrait on the wall
Pick up the BOOK
This is the Goodsoup family history
Read it and go downstairs to talk to Griswold
Say quot Uncle Griswold it's me
Don't you recognize me quot The conversation should turn around to the Goodsoup family history and Griswold will accept you as a Goodsoup family member Order a drink then spike it with the HEAD B CLEAR

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
Cydonia Lightbringer A Walkthrough ByDan Kennedy Introduction What came first ndash the puzzle or the story
Cydonia orLightbringer as its DVD re release is known attempts to grapple with a fundamental problem facing most puzzle focused adventure games ndash how to successfully marry a series of somewhat unrelated puzzles to a coherent story
Supposedly based on actual data from NASA and the Russian space program the gameplay inCydoniacentres around investigating the remains of an ancient race on the planet Mars Cydoniacertainly throws enough graphically intense cut scenes and plot references at us during the beginning stages of the game
A novel timed sequence at the very beginning of the story that ultimately determines the ending of the game is also a nice touch
In fact the meaty cut scenes made this game a perfect candidate for re release in DVD format asLightbringer
However once the puzzles begin to take hold of the game the story degenerates into silliness involving dimensional travel an alien language that our computer can somehow already translate and someone named The Ambassador
Silliness aside the game is entertaining mainly because of the varied and unique puzzles that are challenging but mostly fair some noted exceptions to this occur near the end of the game
The developers should be applauded for at least making a stab at a plot for this mostly puzzle game ndash but one wonders how much more this title could have been with a greater focus on the story
Be sure to run theCydonia patch before playing or alternatively theLightbringerCD ROM patch in order to ensure that you can get past a colour matching puzzle near the start of the game
Connections The year is and the Earth rsquo s instability has sent everybody into orbit
You are part of a small team blasting off to Mars on the Prometheus to investigate signs of ancient life and the opportunity for colonizing the red planet
Unfortunately for you and your shipmates a force field is encountered near the planet rsquo s surface that sends the ship crashing into a Martian gully
After the really long cut scene ends the game begins with you standing in the cockpit of the spaceship
Turn to your left and listen to your commander ndash the fuel tanks have ruptured and it rsquo s up to us to patch into the ship rsquo s computer and empty the tanks
We rsquo ve actually only got a few minutes to do this task before the ship will explode so let rsquo s get cracking
The actions that must be completed are fairly simple though so don rsquo t worry too much about the deadline plus you can always start over since you are so close to the beginning of the game
Following the directions of your commanding officer turn around and face the wall behind you
The ldquo Aux
Computer Uplink rdquo location is fairly easy to spot on the wall ndash just look for the orange and yellow colouring
The cursor changes to a small magnifying glass with a ldquo rdquo sign inside it when placed over the uplink click on the location to get a close up
We now must find a way to connect our personal computer to that of the ship
Right click the mouse to open the inventory menu option screen
You access your inventory by mousing over the icon in the bottom left corner of the screen ndash it spills out to the right
Click on the uplink cable the left most inventory item and see a close up picture of it at the top of the screen
To use the item click the ldquo Use rdquo button to the left of the close up picture
We now must click on the object that we want to use the item with
Click on the uplink port on the wall and watch the cable plug into the socket

Hit the ldquo Back rdquo button in the bottom left corner of the screen
Next click on the ldquo Lower Shaft rdquo button to learn that a fire is burning here
Hit the ldquo back rdquo button again and then click on the ldquo Cockpit rdquo button
The reason for the Cockpit code red isn rsquo t clear so click on the ldquo Suit Diag rdquo button to learn that the co pilot rsquo s spacesuit visor has sprung a leak and that he or she has minutes to live
Hit the ldquo back rdquo button twice more to return to the dashboard and click on the ldquo close rdquo button in the top left corner of the screen to return to the simulated grid
Pan up or down to find one of the ldquo QUIT rdquo nodes and press it to return to the cockpit location
Back away from the uplink panel by locating the magnifying glass icon with the ldquo ldquo sign inside it and clicking away
Damage Control Turn around place the cursor over your commander to get a ldquo TALK rdquo icon and click
You get a number of questions displayed near the bottom of the screen that you can ask just click on them
The responses are brief so be sure to ask all of the questions
We learn the following information There is a fire extinguisher in the ready room that can be used to put out the lower shaft fire There are pressure patches in the ready room that will seal the co pilot rsquo s broken visor The commander rsquo s leg is trapped under a fallen conduit which can be cut away using a torch in the ready room The mission can only succeed if you can deactivate the force field and allow the crew to return home There is a hovercraft in the main bay that can be used to travel outside the spaceship Once the Q amp A session is completed turn to the left find the ldquo dancing arrow rdquo cursor that indicates that you can move in a certain direction and walk toward the cockpit door
Since we do have minutes loads of time
let rsquo s go look at the co pilot

Click on the latch to open the door and back away from the depression in the floor
Turn around and walk towards the door into the cockpit
Click on the latch to open the door and send you through into the cockpit
Notice in the cut scene that your bum is probably the smoothest and roundest of any bum in any adventure game
Walk towards the co pilot on the left and turn to face him or her
Open the inventory page open your pack click on the pressure patch press the ldquo use rdquo button and click on the co pilot rsquo s visor
The leak is sealed up nicely
Now we can rest easy since we rsquo ve beaten the minute deadline
Our next task is to cut our commander free of the conduit
Turn back towards the door walk to it and re enter the ready room using the latch
Walk forward to the depression in the floor and then walk forward again towards the door on the far wall
You should spot the ldquo laser welder rdquo locker containing the cutting torch by panning to the left
Click on the locker for a close up click again to open the doors and click on the torch to place it into your inventory
Close the locker and back away from it

Walk towards the ladder visible on the right side of the room and click on the dancing arrow to ascend the rungs
At the top click on the latch to gain entry to the escape pod
There are six seats but only one can be accessed right now ndash find the seat that can be used and click forward to sit down
Turn to your right in the seat and note the red ldquo Launch rdquo button ndash but suppress the desire to click it ndash you pod will simply rocket upwards crash into the force field fall back to the surface and explode
Instead of certain death would you really want to leave your ship mates behind anyway
get up again and click on the door at your feet
Open the latch and descend back down to the ready room
Turn to your left walk to the door leading outside and click on the latch to its left to go through
Inside the airlock turn to your left and click on the latch for the exterior door ndash which promptly shorts out in a blaze of sparks
This door isn rsquo t going to work ndash turn to your right and click on the latch that lets you re enter the ready room
Walk to the depression in the ground turn around and click by your feet to get to the door
Go through the doorway using the latch and descend the ladder
At the bottom turn to the left and click on the latch on the wall to open the door to the hold
The hovercraft is located in the centre of the room
Turn a bit to the right and walk forward to get a view of the bay doors which are closed right now
Turn around walk back towards the hold door turn to the right and walk forward
Turn to your right to face the hovercraft door and click there to enter the vehicle
Walk forward to the front of the craft and then look down at the dashboard
Find the ldquo Engines rdquo buttons located on the right side of the dashboard and click on the left one
The support arms holding the craft in place in the hold are withdrawn
Facing the bay doors click to move forward ndash your ship crashes through the doors and out into the Mars landscape
My Hovercraft is Full of Dust
Your ruined ship is located directly behind you right now ndash turn around to see it and the wreckage from the crash landing lying about
Facing away from the ship move forward along the crevice until the hovercraft stops
Look around ndash the way ahead appears blocked
We rsquo ve got to get out of this depression
Find the ldquo Jump Jets rdquo buttons located to the right of the Engine buttons and press here to send the hovercraft out of its prison
Spin around to see your new surroundings ndash the crevice that you just escaped from is behind the large brown cliff that forms a large part of your present view see map below
You can now travel between the three locations that may indicate ancient civilization the Face of Mars The Penta Pyramid and the Fortress
Begin with the Face ndash facing the rock wall turn towards the opposite direction find the dancing arrow and move forward look for a small rock in the foreground
The hovercraft speeds over the Martial terrain eventually stopping by a sandy slope with a shallow cave located near the top
Press the engine button to shut off the hovercraft turn around walk to the door and click on it to exit the craft
Once outside turn to your left and click on the cave up the slope to walk towards it we see a quick shot of the face from the air
As you reach the cave a strange portal at the back opens in response to our arrival
Click on the portal to walk over to it and the click on the blue shimmering doorway to enter
You are transported along a shimmering blue conduit to an ornate hall
Walk forward to properly enter the room
A short staircase leading to a landing lies directly in front of you with a staircase spiralling up from the landing to the right
Instead of walking onto the landing turn to your left and walk forward
The Gong Show Turn to your left to see a large golden gong ndash clicking on it produces a ringing sound and causes some strangle alien symbols to appear on the surface
The symbol string on the top left part of the gong appears as follows What do these symbols mean
Well it just so happens that our personal computer can translate all of these symbols into English for us how we know the language beforehand is beyond me
Open up your inventory page click on your computer helmet and press the ldquo use rdquo button to enter the simulation grid
Pan around to reach the Decryption node and press it
The Dictionary provides an alien equivalent for a variety of English words
The Transcript node holds alien conversations and other learnings and the Semantica section has a variety of Martian symbology and other notes
Finally the Keypad allows us to enter alien symbols and get a translation of them
Press the Keypad button type in the string of symbols that we read on the gong and press ldquo Search rdquo
Typing in the above noted symbols yields a translation to ldquo MERCHANT rdquo
Turn to the right away from the first gong and walk forward
A second gong is available for banging to the left
The symbol string reads and translates to ldquo LABOURER rdquo There are three more gongs present in the room that can be gonged read and translated before we return to our starting point in front of the landing
The remaining three gongs contain the following symbol strings and are translated to ldquo JUDGE rdquo ldquo WARRIOR rdquo and ldquo SCHOLAR rdquo The Downward Spiral Once you are back at the entrance door to the room turn to your right and walk up the short staircase onto the landing
Turn to your left and note that the stairs spiral downward into some sort of liquid
Click to go forward and watch yourself descend into the murky depths
A large grey inverted triangle greets you as you come to a stop
There are three strange devices present under the triangle
Click on the panel to the left to see three interlocking coloured circles in the close up
Nothing here can be touched so back away
Click on the item in the centre ndash we can see something inside the folded up mechanism but have no way of opening the device
Back away from the device and click on the panel to the right
The close up view shows a series of buttons arranged in a spiral pattern about a central circle
Six circular buttons on each spiral turn a different colour when pressed but it is not yet evident what needs to be done here
Back away from the panel look down towards the ground and click on the close up cursor
There are five plates in the ground here with a group of alien symbols written in green on each one
The groups of symbols match those on the gongs in the room above
Numbering the gongs through in the order that we first visited them the symbol plates represent the following gongs from left to right
Back away from the plates turn to the right and ascent the stairs
Back on the landing turn to the right and walk forward
We will now bang the gongs in the order that was indicated below
Turn to the right walk two steps forward turn to the left and bang the second gong
Turn to the left walk forward one step turn to the right and bang the first gong
Turn to the left walk forward three steps turn to the right and bang the fourth gong
Turn to the right walk forward one step turn to the left and bang the fifth gong
Finally turn to the left walk forward two steps turn to the right and bang the third gong
Turn to the right and walk forward three steps to the front entrance
Colour Me Bad Turn to the right walk forward onto the landing turn to the left and descend the spiral staircase again
At the bottom the inverted grey triangle will immediately flash three colours at you for example I just got blue blue green
Note that the central panel has now opened ndash try clicking on it
The panel has a whole series of alien symbol buttons and what appears to be some sort of alien numbering system on buttons around the outer ring of the panel
Our goal here is to punch in the names of the colours into the keypad pressing the centre ldquo enter rdquo button after each word
But first we rsquo ll need the alien translation of the colours that flashed in the grey triangle
Open up your inventory page and enter your computer simulation
After pressing Decryption enter the Dictionary node
Find the symbols that represent the name of all three of the colours that flashed in the triangle by looking up the colour alphabetically
Once you rsquo ve got the proper colours translated use the buttons on the alien keypad to type in each colour name in order pressing ldquo enter rdquo at the end of each colour
When successful the triangle hums and folds over itself
If the colours do not seem to work properly get a new set of colours by backing away from the keypad panel and then try entering the symbols for the new colours
Assuming you rsquo ve installed the patch you may have to try this several times before it works properly sometimes it rsquo s hard to tell apart the colours and you might be getting the symbols wrong
Note that the second g and third characters in the colour translations are the same for each colour ndash the buttons for each are respectively found near the centre of the keypad at the o clock position and at the o rsquo clock position
The first symbol should be one of the ldquo number rdquo buttons along the bottom of the panel
Loving the Alien An alien rsquo s head appears in the triangle above the keypad and is now available for questions
The quick version of the story is that a superior alien race interceded in a division between the Martian people and set up a gateway that would lead to enlightenment and the ldquo time stream rdquo where all times exist at once
The force field that our ship encountered protected this gateway site
Only the Ambassador can deactivate the force field and we must travel the time stream to find him or her
Therefore we must travel the path to enlightenment which can be found in the Penta Pyramid
Turn to the right and walk up the stairs again
At the landing continue forward to follow the spiral staircase upwards
At the top of the stairs walk forward and click on the gold ball on the wall directly in front of you
This causes the wall panel to flip around revealing some sort of location map
Click on the multi coloured pyramid to the left for a close up
The pyramid is divided into horizontal sections each of which can be rotated to show one of symbols
Look closely at the green squares found along the base of the pyramid ndash they show symbols from left to right The object here to have these symbols showing in the same order from top to bottom on the pyramid
Just click on each layer to turn it clockwise according to the following directions Top layer ndash click twice Second layer ndash click once Third layer ndash nothing Fourth layer ndash click four times and Fifth layer ndash click three times
The top of the pyramid turns red and lifts up ndash click on it to place it into your inventory and back away from the pyramid
Turn to your left and walk towards the strange contraption with the gold legs ahead in the hall
Click on the panel to get a close up and watch the four spheres on the panel light up
There is an orange triangle exactly like the ones in the centre of the panel on each of the four spheres
Your task is to make the orange triangle appear at the front of all four globes in the same position as the triangles in the centre
Each globe can be rotated along its vertical axis by clicking at the top of the sphere and along one of its horizontal axes by clicking on the right side of the each sphere the sphere cannot be rotated along its axis that goes into the screen but I digress
Follow these directions from the start to align the triangles properly Left sphere click three times on its top then click once on its right side Top sphere click once on its right side then click three times on its top Right sphere click twice on its right side Bottom sphere click three times on its right side Ramble On A large metal cage opens to the left of your current position ndash turn towards the entrance and walk forward
You now stand beside a reclined chair with large wires running from strangely shaped holes in the floor to a point suspended above the chair
Click on the chair to climb in and note the keypad present on the right side of the screen
Since we don rsquo t have a clue as to what to enter back your way out of the chair turn to the right and exit the room
Turn to your right walk forward and click again to descend the stairs
At the bottom turn to your left walk forward twice look up and click on the blue conduit to travel back outside the face structure
Walk forward one step and then descend the slope towards your hovercraft
Turn to your right and click on the hovercraft rsquo s door to enter the ship
Walk to the control panel and press the engine button
Facing the cave on the slope turn in the opposite direction and move forward towards a round hill
The hovercraft eventually stops by a stone staircase leading upwards to a large temple ndash the Penta pyramid
Feel free to get out and explore the pyramid if you wish but you are missing a key component that will prevent you from accomplishing anything here yet
Instead point your hovercraft in the opposite direction from the staircase and move forward
Your ship comes to a stop facing towards a rocky hill
Click on the hill to move forward ndash your ship climbs the hill and comes to rest in front of a large round stone in the ground
You can get out of your hovercraft and attempt to gain entry to the mysteries below but the stone is much too heavy for you to lift
Instead find the buttons marked ldquo Remote Arm rdquo on the left side of the dashboard and press there
Your mechanical arm swings over and quickly cracks a hole in the stone lid
Click on the Engine button to shut off the hovercraft exit the vehicle turn to the right and walk towards the stone lid
Aim your cursor at the hole and click to descend
What Lies Beneath A platform takes you down into a richly decorated nine sided room
You are surrounded by wall panels bearing more alien symbols
Each panel has a central symbol with two related symbols below the central one Don rsquo t know what they mean but they sure do look swell
Find the dancing arrow at your feet and click to finish your descent into the room below
You find yourself in the centre of a circular room
Walk forward to the large circular panel and click on it once you rsquo re there
The doors slide open to reveal a large circular blue and gold design with some missing sections
Nothing here can be taken so turn to the left walk forward and turn to the right to face the wall
Some drawings are on the wall showing some figures doing something
Interesting yawn
Turn around to face the opposite direction and walk forward twice
The wall in front of you has some symbol laden writing on it
Click on the writing to activate a scanner that zaps the words into your computer
Open up your inventory screen select and use your computer go to the Decryption node and choose the Transcripts button
After an initial phrase click on the Forward corner button and peruse the alien text that has been converted into English
The text lists nine descriptions of planets as follows planet with giant red eye MATTER ringed planet TIME distant blue planet EQUALITY sideways planet POWER blue planet LIFE bright planet LIGHT red planet SPIRIT small fast planet MOTION cold pair RELATION Battle of the Planets Back out of the Decryption area exit your computer turn to the right and move forward
Now turn to the left to see a large circular area surrounded by three smaller circular frames
Click on the frame located at the top of the circular area
After the flashes and light show a picture of a planet appears in the frame
Continue clicking to cycle through all nine planets obviously the ones from our own solar system
If you have any doubts as to which planets correspond to which picture enter your computer click on the Mission Data node and click on the Planetary Data button on the right hand side of the screen
The pictures and identities of the nine planets are displayed here and should convince you that they appear in the frame in order from closest to furthest to the sun Mercury grey Venus beige Earth blue Mars orange Jupiter multi coloured Saturn gold Uranus blue Neptune blue and Pluto green
In addition the pictures and your general knowledge about the planets should help you match up each planet to its description in the alien text planet with giant red eye MATTER ndash the planet with the big red patch is Jupiter
ringed planet TIME ndash Saturn of course plus Uranus shows up later distant blue planet EQUALITY ndash not much to go on but appears to be Neptune
sideways planet POWER ndash the only sideways looking planet is Uranus
blue planet LIFE ndash blue life
Must be Earth
bright planet LIGHT ndash Venus the bright star planet
red planet SPIRIT ndash obviously Mars
small fast planet MOTION ndash small and fast that would be Mercury
cold pair RELATION ndash Pluto which forms a pair with its similarly sized moon The positions of the three frames seem to suggest that the triads of alien symbols we saw in the entranceway may be involved
But how do we connect the symbols to the planets
The key is the word in capitals shown next to each of the nine clues in the alien text
Look up each of the nine words in the Dictionary function of the Decryption node to get the following translations
TIME
EQUALITY
POWER
LIFE
LIGHT
SPIRIT
MOTION
RELATION Saturn Neptune Uranus Earth Venus Mars Mercury Pluto Combining this information with the sets of symbols we found on the walls in the entranceway we come up with the following sets of planets to input into the wall rsquo s frames top planet left planet right planet Jupiter ndash Saturn ndash NeptuneSaturn ndash Mars ndash UranusNeptune ndash Uranus ndash MercuryUranus ndash Venus ndash PlutoEarth ndash Mars ndash NeptuneVenus ndash Earth ndash JupiterMars ndash Mercury ndash SaturnMercury ndash Venus ndash PlutoPluto ndash Jupiter ndash Saturn Input each set of planets into the three frames on the wall using the pictures of the planets
Once the correct match is made the central circular area opens revealing a small golden object with a planet symbol on it
Grab each piece to place it into your inventory and continue with the list of planet combinations until all nine objects have been collected
The Circle Game Once you are finished you should have gold objects with symbols on them ndash small fang like ones and bigger ones
Turn around to face away from the frames and walk forward twice to stand in front of the large circular panel we encountered earlier
Click on the panel to open it up and note that the gold and blue decoration inside the panel has exactly nine pieces missing from it
The gold sections must be placed into the decoration but how do we go about this
Remember the phrase that preceded the planet descriptions in the alien message ldquo From greatness to smallness they are to be planted rdquo
The gold pieces should be placed in order of largest planet to smallest planet which just so happens to be the same order as in the alien descriptions

Saturn
Neptune
Uranus
Earth
Venus
Mars
Mercury
Pluto Take out each of the nine gold objects in your inventory and place them on the decoration in the proper order as noted above
It should be fairly evident from the orientation of each piece as to where it should go but look for the cursor to change the open hand points with one finger when the right spot is found over the correct hole
After the last piece is inserted the decoration spins itself out of the wall like a discus and into your willing hands it rsquo s a lot smaller than I thought
Turn around walk to the centre of the room look upward and click on the dancing arrow to return to the entranceway
Click up once more to return to the ground surface
Turn to the left and walk towards the back of your hovercraft
Click on the doorway to enter return to the control panel and turn on the engine
The way out is located just a bit to the left of the rocky cliff ahead ndash aim for the horizon and off you go
Go forward once more and cruise up to the Penta Pyramid
Hollow at the Centre Shut off the hovercraft exit your vehicle turn to your left and click on the stairs to climb
At the top click on the door to open it and walk through
Proceed up the reddish corridor and admire the view from the platform at the end of the hallway
Click forward to descend the stairs and when you reach the bottom move forward once again
Pan to the right and note the large gold door on the pillar here ndash the design in the centre looks a lot like the patterned discus that you just assembled back at the Fortress
Turn around to face the opposite direction and walk towards the centre of the pyramid
Descending to the centre we encounter a small circle of stone
The plaque facing us has a series of characters that we know mean ldquo JUDGE rdquo from our puzzle solving back at the Face
The alien mentioned something about undergoing tests at the Penta pyramid and the plaque may have something to do with this
Now click on the circle of stone itself ndash it appears to be empty at present
Back away from the circle turn around to face the opposite direction and proceed back to the gold door on the pillar
Now it seems pretty obvious that the discus needs to be used to unlock this door
Open the inventory screen click on the discus but notice the large inset picture of the item at the top of the screen
Each one of the nine gold sections that we added back at the last location can be clicked ndash in fact one of them must be selected before the discus can be used to open the door
Which symbol should be selected
Well we know that each of the symbols is associated with a planet and also a conceptual meaning i e
SPIRIT LIFE etc
Since the planets don rsquo t seem to help here which of the nine conceptual meanings can be most closely associated with the JUDGE occupation
A quick review of the nine meanings found in the previous sections will point you towards EQUALITY or balance
Select the EQUALITY Neptune symbol lt lt Neptune jpg gt gt and press the Use button it rsquo s the ldquo fang rdquo shaped piece located at the bottom of the discus
Click on the pattern in the centre of the doorway and watch the door slowly open
Judge Dread You find yourself looking down a long ramp ndash click to move forward along it and enter a room at its base
There rsquo s a small staircase off to your left that leads to a walkway along the wall and a platform directly ahead of you
Move forward to approach the platform and what appears to be a puzzle ahead
Click on the puzzle for a closer view
There are ten red pegs located along the base of the vertical game board which has exactly holes in it
Click on each of the pegs to place them into your inventory
lt lt judge jpg gt gt Open your inventory and click on one of the pegs to view it in a close up window
The pattern is fairly complex
Now click on another one to spot the difference between the pegs ndash about rds of the way down the surface of the peg there rsquo s a horizontal gap in the pattern that has one of four things in it a single star triangles circles or squares
Go through each of the pegs and count how many pegs of each pattern there are
Only one peg has the single star while there are pegs that show either triangles circles or squares
It isn rsquo t a huge logic jump that the star must be placed at the top of the game board in front of you
Following the pattern of increasing number of shapes as you drop down the game board the three triangle pegs should be placed in the V shaped row below the star peg the three circle pegs in the middle V shaped row and the three square pegs in the bottom V shaped row
A light flashes above and an entity coalesces and flows into a large gold ball above the puzzle
Turn away from the puzzle walk back to the entrance to the room turn to your right ascend the stairs and proceed along the walkway
Click on the gold ball at the walkway rsquo s end for a close up and click again to open the ball up
Inside find a dodecahedron a sided object ndash your reward for solving the puzzle
Back away from the ball turn around walk back to the stairs and down turn to your right and move forward up the ramp
At the top click on the door to proceed through once again
Turn to your right and set out across the pyramid to the next pillar
The Ultimate Warrior You will arrive at a similar pillar with a gold door to your right ndash turn to your left and walk back to the centre of the pyramid
This time the symbols on the plaque indicate ldquo WARRIOR rdquo
Click on the circle of stone to see that a sections of a platform has emerged
Back away turn around and walk back up to the pillar with the gold door
Take out the discus and review the symbol meanings to find a match with WARRIOR ndash this time its POWER Uranus

Proceed down the ramp into the puzzle room below and walk forward to the puzzle
Click on the puzzle to begin ndash little warriors white one gold stand on various blocks of different heights
The object here is to have the little gold warrior to the left be the ldquo last miniature standing rdquo on the centre red square
A move of any of the warriors is only possible when one figure can jump directly over another figure to an empty space either horizontally or diagonally
The warrior that has been jumped over promptly explodes
Getting the gold guy to the centre square on his last jump necessitates moving several of the white figures around
Think of it as a checkers puzzle ndash you want to set the board up so that your little gold friend makes a series of jumps that eliminates the others and sends him to the centre square
The following solution accomplishes this nicely The final jump should trigger the coalescing light force that deposits another prize in the gold ball on the walkway
Turn from the puzzle walk back to the door and up the stairs to the gold ball
Click twice to open it up and take the cube inside
Back away return to the door of the room travel up the ramp and exit through the door
Turn to the right and walk to the next pillar
The Colour of Money At the next pillar turn to your left and walk back to the centre of the pyramid
This time the symbols on the plaque indicate ldquo SCHOLAR rdquo
Click on the circle of stone to see that a second piece of the platform has emerged
Back away turn around and walk back up to the pillar with the gold door
Take out the discus and review the symbol meanings to find a match with SCHOLAR ndash although it might be SPIRIT or RELATION it rsquo s actually LIGHT Venus
Click on thesymbol the bottom left ldquo fang rdquo hit the use button and click on the door
Proceed down the ramp into the puzzle room below and walk forward to the puzzle
An Egyptian figure sits between seven ladies
Click on the puzzle the Egyptian sits up and six coloured disks begin to spin on his body as shown in the diagram with W white R red Y yellow O orange P purple B blue and G green
Locate the pans of coins located on the ground in front of the statues and transfer all of the coins found there into your inventory
Once you rsquo ve got them all there should be each of the red blue green purple and orange coins and each of the white and yellow coins
Note that the seven women statues surrounding the Egyptian each have one of the seven coins around their necks
To convert the coins into colour dye take out each of the coins in your inventory and click on the hands of the matching woman statue
A drop of dye the same colour as the coin is placed into your inventory as a replacement for the coin
Repeat this for all coins
To brighten up the six spinning disks on the Egyptian take out each drop of dye and click on the corresponding coloured disk
Each disk will take on a whitish hue once you rsquo ve added two drops of dye
Be sure to add all of the drops but don rsquo t bother with adding the white ones to the white steam above the Egyptian rsquo s head
The spinning coloured disks on the Egyptian can now be re arranged to match the pattern of a rainbow
To switch the location of any of the disks first click the disk you want to move and then click the new location you want to move the disk to
The colours should be arranged in the following order top to bottom white purple blue green yellow orange and red
Success
Turn away from the puzzle walk to the door ascend the stairs and click on the gold ball to retrieve your sided an icosahedron geometric prize
Back away return to the door of the room travel up the ramp and exit through the door
Turn to the right and walk to the next pillar
Rich Man Poor Man At the next pillar turn to your left and walk back to the centre of the pyramid
This time the symbols on the plaque indicate ldquo MERCHANT rdquo
Click on the circle of stone to see that a third piece of the platform has emerged
Back away turn around and walk back up to the pillar with the gold door
Take out the discus and review the symbol meanings to find a match with MERCHANT ndash MATTER Jupiter seems most appropriate
Click on thesymbol the bottom right ldquo fang rdquo hit the use button and click on the door
Proceed down the ramp into the puzzle room below and walk forward to the puzzle
Begin the game by picking up the green crystals found in front of the of the gold picture box to the left and right
The current picture on the front of the box shows a person removing one of five smaller figures from a group
Note the two levers in the top corners of the picture ndash the levers are currently in their rdquo middle rdquo positions and can be turned one position up or down by clicking above or below the levers
Try putting the levers in different positions ndash placing them both in their ldquo up rdquo positions triggers a shelf to slide out near the base of the picture
Click on the left edge of the picture to rotate the picture box
The new illustration shows the same person now removing another smaller figure from his now smaller group
Play with the levers at the top again ndash placing the left lever all the way up and the right lever all the way down will slide the shelf out
Click on the left edge to turn the picture box again
The new illustration shows the person with only one smaller figure left
Place both levers in the ldquo down rdquo position to slide the shelf out
Rotate the picture box a fourth time the picture shows the person celebrating with a number of smaller figures around
Place the left lever down and the right lever up to have the shelf slide out for the fourth picture
Rotating the picture box once more brings it back to the first picture
We must now place the green crystals on the four shelves of the picture box to mirror what has happened in the illustrated story
We see a person losing ldquo value rdquo through the first three pictures but then claiming lots of value in the last picture by not sacrificing loved ones
Assuming that the most value is held in the last picture we can divide up the ten stones into crystals for the first picture crystals for the second crystal for the third and for the fourth Place the appropriate number of stones on each shelf and watch your prize be delivered
Turn away from the puzzle walk to the door ascend the stairs and click on the gold ball to retrieve your sided geometric prize
Back away return to the door of the room travel up the ramp and exit through the door
Turn to the right and walk to the next pillar
Circular Reasoning At the next pillar turn to your left and walk back to the centre of the pyramid
This time the symbols on the plaque indicate ldquo LABOURER rdquo
Click on the circle of stone to see that a fourth piece of the platform has emerged
Back away turn around and walk back up to the pillar with the gold door
Take out the discus and review the symbol meanings to find a match with LABOURER ndash how about MOVEMENT Mercury
Click on thesymbol the top right ldquo fang rdquo hit the use button and click on the door
Proceed down the ramp into the puzzle room below and walk forward to the puzzle
You are faced with a game board of three concentric circles that are divided into yellow green and red zones
There are blocks of each colour located at various positions on the circles
The object here is to move each of the blocks to its respective coloured area and to the outer and middle rings of that area
The difficulty is that only a limited number of moves is allowed to accomplish your goal
The moves include the following in order The outer ring rotates in a counter clockwise direction required Two blocks can be moved one position The middle ring rotates in a clockwise direction required Two blocks can be moved one position The inner ring rotates in a counter clockwise direction required Two blocks can be moved one position After the final move if the puzzle has not been solved the game board reverts to its initial settings
Begin the puzzle by clicking on any of the blinking block holders on the outer ring ndash the ring rotates in a counter clockwise direction
You now have two moves before the middle ring must be rotated
But if you think about it you really have no choice since the outer ring will never be rotated again you MUST move the red block in the yellow area to the middle ring which in turn requires you to move the green block in the yellow area to the inner ring
Click on the green block in the yellow area and then click on the empty space on the inner ring to move it there
Now do the same thing to move the red block in the yellow area to the middle ring
Click on the middle ring for it to rotate in a clockwise direction
Things look much better now don rsquo t they
Move the yellow block on the middle ring in the yellow area to the outer ring and then do the same for the green block on the middle ring in the green area
Click to rotate the inner ring in a counter clockwise direction and then shift the yellow and green blocks from the inner to the middle ring to complete the puzzle
Turn away from the puzzle walk to the door ascend the stairs and click on the gold ball to retrieve your sided tetrahedron geometric prize
Back away return to the door of the room travel up the ramp and exit through the door
Rise Above it All Walk directly forward to the centre of the pyramid and step into the stone circle
Click on the platform again to take a ride up through the centre of the pyramid and into a control room
Is this some sort of vehicle
Nothing appears to be operational on the main panel note the empty metal bowl located above the panel and the red capstone from the Face does nothing here
Look down find the dancing arrow and click to descend back down to the floor of the pyramid
Back off the platform turn around and walk back towards the last pillar you came from make sure it rsquo s the ldquo LABOURER rdquo one
At the pillar turn to the left and go forward to the next pillar
Once you rsquo re there turn to the right find the dancing arrow just to the right of the pillar door and click here to return to the base of the long staircase
Turn to the left ascend the stairs and then walk forward along the long red corridor to the exterior door
Click to open the door and move forward down the oversized stairs
Time to return to the Face location for some follow up work
Turn to the right get into your hovercraft turn on the engines pan to the right past the stairs find the dancing arrow and move forward
After arriving at the Face location shut off the engine get out of the hovercraft and head up the slope to your left to the entrance cave
Move forward towards the entrance and click on the blue conduit to go inside
Walk forward twice to get onto the landing turn to your right and ascend the spiral stairs
At the top pan to the left until you see the upright panel that allowed you to enter the inner control room and click to walk towards it
Turn to your left and enter the control room ahead
Square Pegs Remember the odd shaped holes in the floor in here
We rsquo ve found a spot to use our odd shaped prizes for completing the tests back at the pyramid
Begin by taking the cube item out of your inventory open inventory select item press ldquo use rdquo pan around to the left and click on the square shaped hole in the floor behind you there rsquo s a coiled wire running out of it towards the centre of the room
The finger pointing cursor lets you know if you rsquo ve selected the right hole
The cube settles down inside the hole quite nicely
Next take out the tetrahedron the one shaped like a pyramid and click on the hole located to the right of the one currently holding the cube
Next take out the sided object looks like a diamond and click on the hole that rsquo s located on the far side of the gold bowl set into the floor at the foot of the chair
The dodecahedron sided object each side is a pentagon should be placed in the hole nearest to the headrest of the chair and the icosahedron sided object each side is a triangle should be placed in the hole to the left of the dodecahedron
If you were expecting something to happen keep waiting ndash we haven rsquo t placed the connector yet
Open up your inventory take out the red capstone object and click in the area where the five wires running from the holes come together above the room rsquo s chair again look for that finger pointing cursor
Not so spectacular so take a load off and click on the chair to sit down
We rsquo ve got a keypad in front of us so its natural to assume we rsquo ve got to enter something into it
What command would be most appropriate here
No not shazam
This is actually out of left field actually the next set of puzzles all come out of left field
Wouldn rsquo t it be great to shed some light in here OPEN this place up
OPEN your computer OPEN the Decryption node and then OPEN the Dictionary
Think of a word that will help you OPEN you mind to the possibilities on Mars
What you think OPEN might be that word
You rsquo d be correct
Ladies and Gentleman We are Floating in Space Copy down the verb tense for OPEN close the computer click on those five keys in order first symbol is on the left second is near the centre third is at the top fourth is near the centre and fifth is at the bottom
Press the centre button after you have completed the word ndash the roof of the building opens and then geometric shapes produce some sort of concentrated power source that is deposited in the gold depression at the foot of the chair
Get up out of the chair and pick up the blue glowing ball in the gold bowl
Turn to the right exit the room turn to the right again walk forward and click again to descend the stairs
At the bottom turn to your left walk forward twice look up and click on the blue conduit to travel back outside the face structure
Walk forward one step and then descend the slope towards your hovercraft
Turn to your right and click on the hovercraft rsquo s door to enter the ship
Walk to the control panel and press the engine button
Facing the cave on the slope turn in the opposite direction and move forward in the vehicle towards a round hill
Back at the Penta pyramid turn the engine off exit the vehicle turn to your left and ascend the stairs
Enter the door proceed up the hallway and descend the stairs ahead into the main pyramid chamber
Walk forward to one of the pillars turn to the left and walk forward to the centre of the pyramid
Click on the circle of stone and click on the platform inside to ride it up to the strange vehicle at the top
Take out the strange blue power globe from your inventory and click on the metal bowl located just above the centre of the control panel
The top of the pyramid explodes as your little pyramid shaped ship takes off for the heavens
You somehow use a laser to blast a hole in the sun zip around a bit and then come out again
You approach a blue planet judging by the pictures from before it looks like Uranus and touch down on some strange looking landing pad near some giant toadstools
The Crystal Method Look down and click to drop down out of your ship
Across the water there are several large triangles some old looking sculptures and some other stuff
As you spin around there are coloured crystals on pedestals green yellow blue purple and red
Click on each of the crystals to hear a series of notes chiming
These notes are frustratingly difficult to hear and pick out
Starting from the right of the green crystal the one just to your left when you first descended from the ship take note of the number of notes that are played for each crystal yellow blue purple or so red ndash and green ndash see diagram below Look down towards the ground and click here to descend into a grid of metal beams
There are four black mechanisms here that are found amongst the metal beams ndash clicking on each of them plays a single note similar to the tones that the crystals above played
You rsquo ll go mad though trying to reproduce the tones of all of the crystals ndash which ones do you play and in what order
Instead concentrate on the number of notes that each crystal played when clicked
Standing at the ldquo gap rdquo in the beam work the one spot where there are no criss crossing beams number the sound generators through as you pan to the right see below
Following your number convention for the sound generators and using the number of chimes each crystal plays clockwise starting with yellow and avoiding that pesky purple one we get the numeric progression
Hit the sound generators in that order and a large whale with leaves sticking out of its back arrives to take you away
And if you rsquo re wondering I rsquo m quite aware of the lameness of my solution to this puzzle ndash if you have an explanation that actually makes sense e mail me
Find the gap in the beam work again and click here to drop down onto the back of the whale
Look down into the water ahead of the whale and click here to take a journey through the water
You arrive at a cave ndash walk forward onto the waiting ramp and click forward to walk to the door across the room
The door has three panels on it and the symbolsabove it
Try clicking on any of the door panels ndash one of the three symbols will appear in the small box above the symbols
Match the panels up with the three symbols and then click on them in order to recreate the pattern above the correct order is right panel bottom panel and left panel
The Garden of Earthly Delights Move forward through the open doorway and float upward through the water to emerge through a stone well
You stand atop a lush slightly strange garden island
Admire the beautiful view and click straight ahead to descend a series of stone steps
As you turn to the right note the series of tall stepping stones that allow access to another part if the island
Keep turning to the right and encounter a series of alien symbols carved into the rock
Copy down the symbols exactly as shown on the rock open your inventory screen access your computer enter the Decryption node and click on the Keypad button
Enter each group of symbols into the display on the right and hit enter for a translation
You should be able to assemble the following message IT IS THE BRIDGE OF NOW AND THE FUTURE WITH IT YOU CAN FORM YOUR REALITY IT IS THE MOST POWERFUL THOUGH POWER
Note that the capital L at the start of the message is really a vertical line with a dot to the left combined with a symbol
Exit the computer and before you turn away pick up the angular purple object that sits just to the right of the carved riddle
Are there any more hidden around here
Turn to the right and see another rock face with alien symbols on it
This one looks a bit different though ndash there are a number of symbols spaced out evenly rows of three columns with one symbol at the top and bottom
Look around ndash is there anything here that resembles the symbols on the rock face
Yes ndash the stepping stones
Could the symbols imply that we rsquo ve got to spell out a word or words while crossing the chasm
You betcha ndash and the word is probably the solution to the riddle we found earlier
In other words we must be able to spell out the answer to the riddle by stepping on certain stones as we cross to the other side
Now the riddle ndash something future looking ndash Thought
Ideas
How about imagination
Look up the word in the dictionary and it will yield the following spelling We can easily spell that by stepping on the correct stones as we cross the chasm
Step in Time Before you cross to the other side return up the hill by clicking over the top of the rocks where the riddle is carved into the stone
Turn away from the stone well to the left and find a hotspot in the grass located to the right of the red toadstools
Clicking here yields another angular purple piece
Turn back to the right past the stone well and find a similar hotspot just to the left of a clump of three toadstools
A third purple piece ndash this must be part of some puzzle
Keep turning to the right and descend the stairs again
Save your game now since one false step will end your life here
At the bottom turn to face the stone steps and click on the furthest stone to the right in the first row representing the second symbol in the word ndash the first is our starting point
Your two next steps should also be to the stepping stones furthest to the right in the next two rows
Step to the centre stone in the last fourth row of stones and then continue onto the ground on the far side of the chasm
Turn to your left to spot another set of alien symbols on a rock here ndash looks like we rsquo ll need to step on a different step of stones to get back across we rsquo ll come back to this riddle
Turning to the right spot two low trees here ndash another puzzle piece lies just to the left of them
Keep panning to the right past the stairs leading upward until you can see another narrow tree against the rock face
Another piece the fifth so far can be found just to the left of this tree
Pan back to the left and click on the stairs to move forward
You enter a clearing at the top of the stairs that contains a series of coloured stones set in a familiar spiral pattern
Remember the panel on the right hand side when you descend the spiral staircase inside the Face complex
Well here it is
Make sure you jot down the positions and colours of the stones in the clearing ndash you rsquo ll definitely need them later
Facing the left side of the spiralled rocks pan to the left until you see a purple tree
Another purple block can be found on the ground between this purple tree and a blue tree to its left
Keep panning to the left and note the path that leads off towards a cliff to the right of the stairs you just came up
Another purple block can be found on the ground between this path and the staircase
Continue panning to the left until you see another path heading into the trees to the left of the stairs
Click here to move down the path
Don rsquo t Touch Me Ahead of you sits several rocks that are propped up on each other creating an accessible space underneath
Before you go diving down under there turn to the right ndash another purple block lies just to the right of the rocks
Keep turning to the right past the open cliff ndash another piece can be found on the ground between the cliff and the path back to the clearing
Continue to the right and find a third block lying on the slope to the left of the propped up rocks
Find the cavity under the rocks again and click to go under
You are faced with a round panel with a gold ring set into it
Click on the panel evidently it rsquo s made up of a number of smaller sections as one in the top left section of the panel lights up
Try clicking on the panel to discern the shape of the individual pieces
Back away from the panel and then click on it again
The same section in the top left portion of the panel lights up
Take this as your only clue as to what sections you need to light up in order to solve the puzzle
Unfortunately this is one of those twiddly puzzles where the solution has absolutely nothing to do with the game
We are supposed to ldquo lighten up rdquo any other section of the panel so that no two lightened sections share the same border see diagram starting from the section that is already been lighted
You should end up with something that looks like the diagram to the left
The gold ring will emerge from the panel ndash click on it to place it into your inventory turn around and emerge from the hollow under the rocks
Continue forward to return to the spiral clearing
Building Blocks Find the path located to the right of the stairs and walk forward
Just like the last path several rocks are piled up to form an accessible hollow straight ahead
Turn to the right of the rocks and grab another purple block just to the right of the rocks
A second block lies directly in front of the cliff
Pan around to the right and pick up the very last block the th by the base of the tree to the right of the path back to the clearing
Turn around to face the hollow again and click here to go under the rocks
Underneath find only a small red platform
Open your inventory ensure that you have all thirteen purple blocks one is a small pyramid select one of the pieces that are light grey in colour with some small red dots and click on the red platform to place it there as usual use the pointing hand cursor to tell you where a block can be placed
Use the three other greyish blocks to complete the first layer of the pyramid
Enter your inventory again select one of the purple blocks with a very dark side pointing to the left and place it on top the first layer to begin the second layer
Complete this layer with the other three similar blocks and then build the third layer with the four remaining blocks
Finish the pyramid off with the capstone
The completed pyramid spins and then suddenly alien symbols appear on the pyramid rsquo s faces
Let There Be More Light Each side of the sided pyramid has characters on it ndash click to the side to spin the pyramid around to see all of the surfaces
Here rsquo s what you rsquo ll see Open your computer up consult the Decryption node and input each of these sets of characters into the keypad
The words you will get back include ldquo ABOVE rdquo ldquo LIGHT rdquo ldquo CREATE rdquo and ldquo PLANT rdquo
The third word implies something we must do and there are certainly lots of plants above us
Do we have anything that will help us create more light for the plants here
About the only thing that could do this is our torch from the ready room
Open your inventory up select the torch press the ldquo use rdquo button and click on the browny red fern like plant above the pyramid
The torch cuts a hole in the vegetation and the flower behind the pyramid yields a red ring
Click on the ring to place it into your inventory turn around and exit the hollow
Walk forward to return to the clearing and watch a light being coalesce in the sky
Click the ldquo Talk rdquo cursor on the alien to learn that the spiral panel back at the Face complex will deactivate the force field surrounding the ship
The coloured rings work with the left panel at the same location and start a terraforming process on the surface of Mars
Once you rsquo ve finished with the Ambassador did he say ldquo Eh rdquo
check your inventory ndash he rsquo s deposited the final blue ring there
Turn to the right and click on the stairs to descend to the stepping stones
Steppin rsquo Out Turn to the rock with the alien symbols written on it and record them exactly as written
Enter your computer go to the Decryption node and enter each group of symbols to get a word by word translation of the message which should be THE SPARK OF LIFE THAT BURNS INSIDE AWAKEN THE SENSE AND KINDLES THE FIRE OF REALITY
The answer to this is CONSCIOUSNESS which is not at all obvious
Look up the word in your dictionary to get the alien translation Begin the walk across by stepping on the centre stone of the first row
Step to the right most stone in the second row and then the left most stone in the third row
Step on the centre stone in the fourth row and then step onto the other side
Turn to your left climb the hill above the writing on the stone and then click on the stone well to descend back to the whale
Walk forward towards the whale and then forward again to get on its back
Turn to the right and click on the water in front of the whale to make your return journey to your ship
Back at the note sounding room click straight ahead to climb back off the whale and then click upward to rise up to the crystals
Click up again to return to your pyramid ship take out the blue ball of power from your inventory and place it into the cup above the instrument panel to initiate your journey back across space and time to present day Mars After your return journey through the sun has ended look down and click here to descend back to the floor of the Penta pyramid
Back off the platform check to make sure you are standing in front of the JUDGE plaque if not walk around the stone circle until you find it turn around and walk back towards the pillar
Once you rsquo re there turn to the right find the dancing arrow just to the right of the pillar door and click here to return to the base of the long staircase
Turn to the left ascend the stairs and then walk forward along the long red corridor to the exterior door
Click to open the door and move forward down the oversized stairs
Face the Face Time to return to the Face location to finish our last set of puzzles
Turn to the right get into your hovercraft turn on the engines pan to the right past the stairs find the dancing arrow and move forward
After arriving at the Face location shut off the engine get out of the hovercraft and head up the slope to your left to the entrance cave
Move forward towards the entrance and click on the blue conduit to go inside
Walk forward twice to get onto the landing turn to the left and descend the spiral staircase to the basement
At the bottom click on the panel to the left with the three coloured circles on it
In the close up view take out the red ring from your inventory hold it over the red circle on the panel and click to install
Next take out the yellow ring and place it over the yellow circle
Finish the installation by taking out the blue ring and placing it over the blue circle
We hear ominous rumblings from below the surface as the terraform process begins
Note completing the terraforming of the Mars planet is not necessary to finish the game ndash in fact failing to finish this puzzle yields an alternate ending
Back away from the panel and click on the spiral patterned panel to the right
There are circles on each spiral that can be turned one of six colours by clicking on the circle until the correct colour comes up
Following the colour of the rocks in the clearing back on the Ambassador rsquo s planet input the proper order of the colours on the panel use the diagram from before as a guide
Note that in the bottom spiral blue occurs twice while green doesn rsquo t show up at all all six of the colours are represented on the other two spirals
When you rsquo ve got the correct colour pattern click on the centre button to deactivate the force field you rsquo ll hear a ldquo powering down rdquo sound in the background
The Final Countdown Turn to the right walk up the stairs turn to the right walk two paces forward and click on the blue conduit to take you back outside
Walk forward and then down the slope to the hovercraft
Turn to your right get into the ship walk forward and turn the engines on
Pan to the right past the entrance cave and click on the next big smooth hill to go forward
Your trip ends outside the large crevice that currently houses your crashed ship
Hit the ldquo Jump Jets rdquo button on the extreme right side of the instrument panel to raise the hovercraft up and back down into the crevice
Turn the ship around and move forward to the crashed spaceship site
Turn off the engines get out of the hovercraft turn to the left and walk toward the left side of the big ship
Turn to the right and click on the open bay door to re enter the ship
Walk forward to the door on the far side of the room and click on the latch to the left of the door to go through
Click on the ladder to go up and then on the latch at the top to enter the ready room once more
Back away from the depression in the floor turn to the right and walk to the ladder that leads up to the escape pod
Click on the ladder to go up and again on the latch to enter the pod itself
Look around ndash your two saved colleagues are already in position for the escape flight
Your seat is located directly across from the colleague on the left ndash turn around and click forward to strap yourself in
Finally turn to the right and press the red Launch button to trigger your flight
Endings If you rsquo ve saved both of your colleagues solved the terraforming puzzle and turned off the force field you make a successful journey back to Earth as the hero
The people of Earth make a return journey to Mars and humankind rsquo s new life begins
If you rsquo ve done all listed above but failed to solve the terraforming puzzle you still return a hero but the resettlement of the Earth rsquo s peoples is a little less successful since we rsquo ve got to live on the dusty surface of Mars in what appears to be little bubbles
Obviously if you have not turned off the force field you and your companion rsquo s trip is a short and disastrous one
It rsquo s essentially the same ending as if you rsquo d set off in the escape pod alone at the beginning of the game
The game boasts several other endings but they centre around how many companions you save at the beginning of the game I rsquo m assuming that you rsquo ll want to take both your buddies back with you
