It is another Jumpship Docking Bay like the one where you started
Beside the door is a button and you can hear a humming sound
A force field is making that hum
Turn it off by pressing the button
Walk in the door and jump to the next higher level
Walk straight through the doors and on until you reach a dark room
Notice that lights are shining around the room representing the Spire Lasers that are online
Had you found this earlier and before they had been activated you would have noticed the difference now
You can easily jump up to leave if you find that you have forgotten something
Get up close to the keyboard and press the spacebar
If you are referring to theMap of Europa Station which you should be
your Jumpship arrives in the northern most bay the one pointing toward Command
The corridors on Europa Station are narrower than on the NTI Ark
Even though your stunners still do a decent job in eliminating the Robots and there are loads of them there are several quot Boss Mutants quot who need to be dealt with
There are no places to recharge your stunners here but I'll tell you where to find aContainment Field Projectorwhich will quot contain quot the mutants that you cannot kill
Use it sparingly
I saved it for only the quot Boss Mutants quot that I could not avoid
You will recognize the regular water doors the doors that require aPolywater Keyto enter and the Airlock doors with their wavy green fields there are hundreds of them
You know that you always need to press the blue button in an Airlock hall to go through the other door so I won't tell you each time
USING THE MEMORY ORB
Turn around and walk to the far wall
Jump up to get out of the ship and walk through the Airlock until you are facing a big patch of seaweed
Ahh
Turn right and go through the first airlock door to your left
Walk left and through the next airlock continuing straight to a door where you must insert aPolywater Key
You have found Command
Walk around either side of the dividing wall and find the goldenMemory Orband pick it up
Leave Command
Go through the airlock and straight hugging the left wall
Take the first right turn and turn right ignoring the water door and follow the passage until you find a left turn
Take that left turn and go throught the water door into the Comm
Lab
Here you see a bunch ofMemory Orbs
Walk around the room and notice where the humming noise gets loudest
When you are facing a machine that looks like a monitor on tentacled legs select aMemory Orbfrom inventory and press the spacebar
Pick up all of the Memory Orbs in the room and play each one
To hear the message again press the P key

Before you leave walk up to the machine that looks most like a Jukebox and press the space bar
Turning on this NTI Transceiver should make is possible for your spouse to contact you
FINDING THE CONTAINMENT FIELD PROJECTOR
Leave the Comm Lab and take a left turn
Turn at the next possible right and go through the Airlock
The room at the end of the hall has storage containers that hold morePolywater Keys
The containers look like fat genies
Leave and go back through the Airlock
Turn right
At the next intersection turn left
Then take the nd right turn
The room is empty but you can hear a humming sound
There is aSecret Passagehere
Find the wall that looks off color and a bit shaded
The wall is toward the rear left corner of room
Walk through the wall and down the long passageway to a round room
At the end of the next corridor is theContainment Field Projector plus your first victim
Pick up the weapon SELECT IT and shoot the Mutant if you can't avoid him
It's just a temporary holding tank but it'll get him stopped in his tracks
FINDING PART OF THE MUTAGEN CURE
Leave the Secret Passage to the main corridor
Turn right and keep going straight and go through the first Airlock door you will find on your left
Once on the otherside of the Airlock turn right and then right again and through another Airlock door that is protected by a Robot
Walk down this very long sweeping corridor and take the first left Airlock door
Turn left then right and insert aPolywater Keyto enter Biological Sample Storage
FindPart of the Mutagen Cureon the floor behind the counter
FINDING PART OF THE MUTAGEN CURE
Leave the Biological Sample Storage room and take a left and then a right to lead to the Airlock door
Once on the other side of the Airlock door turn left and walk directly to another airlock door which you should go through
Then walk along that corridor bearing left at the next intersection and walk through the water door
You have entered the Engineering Dept
of a Minisub Bay
If you are looking at the map it is the Minisub Bay at the top left
Walk straight into this room avoiding the Boss Mutant if you can
Find a square hole in the floor and drop into it
You'll need to jump up onto the rim and then drop down into it
Drop down once more and enter the Airlock
Activate the button and ride in the Minisub
You have arrived in Cavern
Note The Minisubs are preprogrammed to take you to the four caverns in sequential order so it does not matter which Minisub you travel in first you will always start in Cavern
The Minisub will continue to recharge while you search for the one item available from this cavern
Once you have the one item the Minisub will take you back and cannot be used again
Get in another Minisub to go to the next cavern
CAVERN
There are exits
The left passage is a dead end but has a clump of healthy first aid sod
While facing the Minisub turn right and take that passage
Follow it along until you reach a pool of water
Jump in
This underwater passage will fork
Look for a right passage it is hard to see which winds around to the right to a pool above you where you can exit
If you take the left one by mistake it will also lead to a pool
That path leads to a large room with two adjoining passages
There is a first aid rock in one of the rooms and a winged mutant wanders around here but nothing else
Once out of the water walk straight ahead
It is almost impossible to avoid the one item you need aMetal Plank
After picking it up leave
To get back to the Minisub go to the pool and jump in
While swimming take the left passage to the exit hole
The path from there leads to the Minisub which will take you back to the Station
Jump up twice to get back to the Engineering Dept
of this Minisub Bay
Turn and walk around the box to the right walking forward and out the far exit
A point of reference can be the observation room entrances should be on the left of the Minisub bay
Turn left and take the second left the first left is probably the entrance to another Jumpship
It is guarded by a Robot
Go through a water door into another Engineering Dept
for a Minisub Bay bottom left on the map
Be ready this Bay is protected by a group of Robots and several other pesky mutants
Find the square hole in the floor
Jump in and down to activate the button and travel to Cavern
CAVERN
Turn completely around so that the Minisub is behind you
There are six separate passages to choose from
Walk toward the right and take the first right passage
Make your way through the narrow corridors until you come to a low rectangle opening
Press the Z key to crouch down and carefully walk forward
A message on your screen advises that you need to put something across the quot Unjumpable Chasm quot
Get close to the edge on the right side
Select theMetal Plankand press the spacebar
Walk across the plank to the other side
Continue forward bearing right until you find a boiling pool of water with stepping stones
Jumping across these stepping stones is tricky
With each successful leap SAVE
It helps to look down PageDown key to make sure you are standing on the very edge of each stone before you jump
You will be doing a zigzag pattern across the pool
Sorry it was too difficult to map
After you are across follow the passageway to a room with a colorful machine and a winged mutant
Take the other door out and follow that corridor to a murky pond with something in mid air above it
Walk into the pond and get theSludge
You must now go back the way you came stepping stones and all
Once you are back at the Minisub you can explore the other caverns if you wish
You have the item you came for so you can leave in the Minisub when you want to
Jump up twice again to get back into the Engineering Dept
Find the entrances to the observation rooms and keep them on your left so you exit in the proper place
Stay hugging the left wall and keep going straight until you reach a water door
Go inside the third Engineering Department bottom right on the map and find the square hole
Jump in press the button and travel to Cavern
CAVERN
This cavern is so easy a welcome relief from the one before it
See the rock that is blocking the entry to the only passage
Use theSludgeon the rock to quot make it slippery quot and it rolls out of the way
Travel down the path to the end
Pick up theStalactiteand return the way you came
Once back in Engineering find the proper exit by keeping the entries to the observation rooms on your left once again
In the hallway hug the left wall and take the second passage left through a water door
You should have arrived in the last Engineering Department top right on the map
The Minisub here will take you to the last cavern Cavern
CAVERN
There are two exits from the Minisub location
Find the running water and jump into it
Travel to the end and be ready to jump at the waterfall
Once you are on the step bridge jump and walk over to the other side
Walk through the exit on the other side and take the right fork at the first intersection
There will be an opportunity to turn left do so
At the end of the passage pick up theThermal Lichen
Leave and bear to the left as you walk
When you come to the end of the passage and are facing a big black empty space walk straight into it
You have a slight fall down to where the Minisub sits
Turn right and walk past the river and all the way to the end
Go in the entryway on the right
While travelling keep to the right
You come upon a large room which has an exit on the opposite side
Walking in this narrow passage follow the right path again until you find a pool of water
Jump into it
Note The water may be too hot to enter
Use theThermal Lichen
See above
The swim underwater seems a bit longer than normal
You should go right when you see an opportunity
Find the exit waterhole and go up
Follow the path in front of you to another big room
This one has pillars of various heights which form steps to the higher level
Jump up on the stepping stones and over to the other side
You come to a large room which appears to be a dead end
Find a wall that looks different than the rest
Use theStalactiteon the wall and go getPart of the Mutagen Cure
Leave and return the way you came to Minisub
Get on and jump up to the Engineering room
SAVING THE ALIENS AND PLANETYou are ready to combine the ingredients of the cure
To do that go to the Science Lab
If you are looking at the map your last Minisub trip was on the one from the top right Bay
I found it easiest to go through the bottom right Bay and then to the Science Lab

With the entrances to the observation rooms on your right this time find the water door exit
Once out hug the right wall
Do not turn at the first right
Instead follow the hallway to the right and into another water door
Enter this Engineering room and walk all the way through it almost straight and out the far water door
Bearing right again walk past the first left door
Turn left and enter the Airlock door there
Keeping basically straight make no turns until you find another Airlock door
Go through it
On the other side you will want to take the very first right turn
This pathway leads to the Science Lab where you must use anotherPolywater Keyto enter
Walk to the left side of the room to the machine on the wall
This is the NTI Cure Making Machine
Select each part of theMutagen Curefrom inventory and press the spacebar to insert each one into the machine
A quot thank you quot is all you receive in return
Understanding the aliens has never been easy but this time it seemed it said something about needing to terraform the planet
The planet cannot be terraformed while Europa Station is on its surface
You must launch Europa Station which must be done from the Command room
Exit the Science Lab and take a right
Take the nd Airlock door you come to it's is directly in front of you then follow the left passage
Hug the left wall and keep walking straight making no turns until you are faced with another Airlock door
Once on the other side of it keep walking straight ignoring all turns until you come again to an Airlock door
Go through it follow the left path to another Airlock door
You should hear the humming of the Command center as soon as the airlock cycles
Walk to the other side of the dividing wall and behind the counter where the Memory Orb once stood
Activate thePower Switch left mechanism with red star like design
Activate theLaunch Sequence right mechanism with the yellow circle pattern THE END GAME BOOMERS hints cheats and walkthroughs
Adam's Venture episode The Search for the Lost Garden Developed by Vertigo Games Published by Iceberg Interactive Walkthrough by PolloDiablo October Gameplay This is a third person adventure game with action sequences and timed puzzles
The game does not support the use of a mouse everything is done with the keyboard only
The main menu has game new game load game options and exit the game
The game saves your progress automatically at checkpoints throughout the game and cannot be saved manually
I encountered some problems after loading a saved game where I ended up between two doors that were both closed so it is recommended to play the entire game in one go can be done in about two hours
It is not Alt TAB friendly
Also you can die in this game but you will return to the latest checkpoint
The game has some hidden 'treasures' to collect these are texts that do not influence the game in any way
The game does not keep track of how many you have found
I will mark these with anOptionaltag so you can skip them if you are not interested
Intro We see and hear Adam Venture a young explorer explain how this whole adventure started with finding some memoirs from a knight Charles L'Heureux
The document is full of strange symbols but Adam recognizes the names of the four rivers that mark the location of the Biblical Garden of Eden
He manages to get funding from the Clairvaux Corporation and together with his girlfriend Evelyn their dog and professor Jacques Saint Omair they set out to discover if the gardens are still there
At the Gates of Eden As the game starts Adam Evelyn the dog and the professor have just set up a base camp near the entrance to the famous Gardens
A pop up hint will appear telling you to use the arrow keys to walk towards Evelyn so let's do so
At the bottom left of the screen you will see some arrows these indicate you have reached the first checkpoint
Walk towards Evelyn until a new pop up box appears telling you hitting Enter will open a conversation between Adam and Evelyn
Oh no Adam forgot to unload the crates of food and the plane has left because of a sand storm Evelyn then tells you the professor needs your help with something and gives you a radio walkie talkie accept it with the Enter key
Use the arrow keys to walk behind Evelyn towards the circle and the gates
Optional You can look at the circle by walking onto it until the Look hint appears press Enter
Some pieces are missing
Press Enter again to close the screen
Optional Adam's dog is here you can talk to him press Enter when the pop up appears and he will bark back
Use the arrow keys to walk towards the staircase and go up
You will get another pop up that tells you you can run by holding down the Shift key
Go up until you reach the professor
When the Talk pop up appears press Enter
Adam would like to just blast his way past the doors but the professor wants to preserve them
He believes there is another way in but the entrance is hidden behind some rocks
He asks you to find some explosives to clear these away
Go back to base camp and find the crates under the roof
Press Enter to inspect the crate then Enter again to pick them up
Return to the professor who has come down the stairs a bit and is getting impatient
Go up a bit further until you get the Place hint
Press Enter and Adam will automatically run for cover
Return to the now cleared entrance and walk into the cave
At the end go left and Adam falls down a slope
Evelyn calls him on the radio but Adam tells her not to follow him just yet
He sees some swinging axes blocking the way
Walk towards them
A Checkpoint saves your progress here
If you use the Shift key along with the arrow forward you can run past them without dying
If you do get hit you will die and return to the last checkpoint but you can try as many times as you like
You can also pause between the two axes but the camera angle makes it a little hard to judge where the second axe is in relation to Adam so it's better to just run through both in one go
The search begins You end up in a cave
A cut scene shows you the layout of the cave
OptionalGo to the right and use Enter to Pickup a chest
It contains the first secret of the game a text about Charles L'Heureux
Go back to the entrance of the cave
Go to the left and follow the path until you come to a ledge
You can Jump with the Space Bar
Do so to make the message box disappear
Make your way further into the cave and you will reach an overhang
Pressing Ctrl will make Adam crouch
Continue towards the light
As you reach the other side press Ctrl again to make Adam stand up again
Explore the new cave and walk towards the ledge
Adam can Hang from it by jumping towards it use the Space Bar to jump
Now use the arrow keys to go to the right
Drop off by using the Ctrl key
At this point Evelyn gets in touch again and asks what is going on
He tells her he sees bats and hears a strange hissing noise but she hears nothing
Must be static interference
Walk down the ramp and towards the back of the cave
There are two openings here but a gate is blocking one of them The other has a crate in its opening
Get close to the crate and you will get the option of grabbing it and dragging it out of the way with the arrow keys
Now you can enter it don't forget to press Ctrl to crouch
Go though and you will end up in the first cave again but now you are in its center
Walk towards the right and you will see a button on the wall
Go close to it and press Enter
This opens the gate in the previous cave
Go back to the left and press Ctrl to crouch and re enter the tunnel
Go back to the cave and enter the tunnel that was previously closed off with the gate
There are some rats here but they are harmless
Follow the tunnel until you end up in a cave that has what looks like waterfalls made of dust or smoke
OptionalGo behind the rightmost of these 'dustfalls' to find the second secret treasure chest and return to the cave
On the bottom left of the screen there are some white stones forming a ledge
Go there and press the Space Bar twice to jump up
Go around and press the button on the right
This operates an elevator in the first cave
Go back to the ledge and return to the tunnel with the rats
Crouch to go through re enter the tunnel that was previously blocked with the crate and return to the first cave
Evelyn contacts Adam again but there is more static
The professor has managed to translate some of the inscriptions and warns Adam that these caves were designed to keep humans away from the Holy Gardens for ever but Adam is determined to go on
Walk onto the circular plate in the middle and the elevator will go down
Walk toward the back of the cave until you find your way blocked by a bush
Press Enter to set fire to it with your torch and continue to the next cave
Faith Hope and Love Cross the bridge and Adam will try to reach Evelyn
The connection is very bad and there is a lot of interference
A shadow cloud enters the cave
A checkpoint will automatically save your progress here This cave has three exits and only one of them is correct
They are marked with Faith Hope and Love
If you choose the wrong exit you will die
Fortunately there is a puzzle that will tell you the correct answer
Walk to the pillar and press Enter to inspect it
It has three blocks each with part of a sentence on it
The goal of the puzzle is to get them in the correct order
Select one of the blocks with the arrow keys and press Enter until it shows the correct bit of sentence
Select the ldquo Check rdquo button at the top with the arrow keys and press Enter to check if your solution is correct
If so all three gates will open
If not try again
The solution is ldquo So these three things remain rdquo ldquo Faith Hope and Love rdquo ldquo But the greatest of these is Love rdquo
This is your clue to choose the exit marked Love
The gate closes behind you and the shadow cannot pass through
You are now in a new cave
OptionalThere is a well hidden ledge right at the entrance of this cave to the left behind the pillar there
It does not give you the Jump pop up hint so you may have to try a few times
Pick up the chest for you third secret
Return to the main path
Walk towards the gate on the left
There is a stone pillar here which you can Use by pressing Enter
This not only opens the gate but rewards you with yourfirst Puzzle Piece Adam calls Evelyn to tell her the good news
Continue down the path
A checkpoint automatically saves your progress here Ignite the brazier by pressing Enter to open the gate and enter
A Leap of Faith Cross the bridge and choose the middle path
Adam needs a key to open this gate
Go back and choose the rightmost path behind the waterfall
Adam needs fire
Go back and choose the leftmost path behind the waterfall and continue to the puzzle pillar
In the same way as before place the texts in the correct order and select the ldquo Check rdquo button with your arrow keys to check the solution If your solution is correct the waterfalls will disappear
The solution is ldquo Everything can distract you rdquo ldquo Look behind the material world rdquo ldquo Take the leap of faith rdquo
Go back and re ignite your torch at the brazier
Choose the rightmost path and ignite the brazier there
You can now continue deeper into this cave and find a key here
Go back and choose the middle path

Walk onwards until you are on an rock overhang above a ravine
OptionalThere are some white stones on the edge of this overhang
Jump down and enter the water
Go towards the back and walk along the rightmost edge of the waterfall
Follow the water and you will see some drawings of a jumping man and hands reaching out to catch him
Go left to find the fourth secret chest
Go back and climb out of the water
At the white stone ledge use Space Bar twice to climb up again
Now it's time for that leap of faith
Stand near the entrance of the cave where the gate was that you opened with the key and hold down Shift to run
Just as Adam leaves the overhanging rock press Space to jump into the waterfall across the ravine
Adam will automatically grab an invisible ledge
Press Space Bar again and he will climb on
If you don't make it just jump out of the water at the white stone ledge and try again
Walk down the path and Adam will see that shadow cloud again
He calls Evelyn to tell her
Continue on this path cross a stone bridge follow the path cross a wooden bridge and find another stone pillar
Use this to find thesecond Puzzle Piece This also lowers a ledge into place
Jump towards this ledge to grab it and use the arrows to go to the right
Drop off with the Ctrl when you are above the wooden bridge and follow the path to a blue cavern

Go up and light your torch if needed
Continue
A Full Spectrum Continue onwards and you will see that the black shadow is still following Adam
Arrive in a cave with some crystals and some pillars
There is a gate on the left with a brazier behind it some kind of apparatus in the middle and a huge stone plate covering an exit
An orange glowing crystal hangs to the right of this exit
Finally there is another stone puzzle pillar here If you inspect the apparatus you will find out something is missing
Go to the puzzle pillar at the back and jump into the water behind it
Walk towards the back and Pick Up a green crystal

Go towards the yellow light and end up in that small cave behind the waterfall in the blue tunnel I mentioned before
Leave this cave go left climb the rope ladder and re ignite your torch
Walk back to the puzzle pillar and solve it by using the arrow keys and turning the blocks to put the sentence in the correct order
Use the arrow keys to select ldquo Check rdquo and if correct the gate in front of the brazier will open
The solution is ldquo I am the Light
Who follows me rdquo ldquo will never walk in darkness rdquo ldquo but will have the light of life rdquo
Use your torch to ignite the brazier
Use the green crystal with the contraption in the middle of the cave
It is a prism
Now because the glowing crystal next to the stone plate is orange it stands to reason we need orange light
Go to the yellow crystal and turn it then do the same with the red crystal
The orange glowing crystal is now activated and the exit opens The shadow cloud flees and Adam calls Evelyn to tell her he has discovered it is afraid of light
Follow the orange glow into the cave
Cross the bridge and follow the path until you find a stone pillar

If you don't make it in time go back down and light the right brazier again
Crawl down the tunnel and burn away the spider's webs
A gust of wind will extinguish your torch
Go on and follow an arrow on the wall
Go down the rope ladder and drop down with the Ctrl key
A checkpoint automatically saves your progress here To the right is a small stream with a crate in it

She will continue to talk to you for a while
A checkpoint automatically saves your progress here Sound Belief There are three objects here and three holes in the bottom through which steam escapes
There is also a Puzzle Pillar here next to a huge stone blocking an exit
Solve the Puzzle Pillar as usual and use the arrow keys to select ldquo Check rdquo to confirm your solution
It will give you the hint ldquo Listen to the wind rdquo and the objects will activate and start making sounds
The solution is ldquo The wind blows where it will rdquo ldquo and you hear it's sound rdquo sic ldquo So it is with all born of the spirit rdquo Grab the objects and drag them onto a hole until you get the correct sound
If musical notes appear you are doing it right
The large stone will roll away revealing an exit
The solution is Drag the object with the pipes trumpets to the backmost hole
The object with the wings belongs on the leftmost hole
The object with the horns on the rightmost hole
Enter the tunnel and reach another cave
There is a brazier here that you can use to relight your torch if you need to

A stone bridge will appear
Cross it and go down the rope ladder
A checkpoint automatically saves your progress here Cross the wooden bridge and find another Puzzle Pillar
A block is missing from it so we can't solve it
Walk into the dark tunnel behind the pillar and go left
Walk to the white stone ledge and climb up
Jump down at the other side
Go around the corner and see another white stone ledge
Ignore it for now and continue until you reach the bottom of the cave
Continue into the watery cave and find a small island with a burning brazier and four extinguised braziers in the water around it
There is also a gate behind it we see the missing Puzzle Pillar block
This is a timed puzzle
Lighting one of the braziers with your torch will only make it burn temporarily
You have to light all four to open the gate
Go to each of the braziers in turn and light them to find out how long they will burn and use that to determine the best route
Use the Shift key to run from one brazier to another
For me the best route was to light the second from the left first then the rightmost then the third from the left and finally the leftmost
But you may find another route easier for instance
When the gate opens pick up the missing block and return to the white stone ledge
Climb up crawl through the cave and find a chest
OptionalOpen it to reveal the ninth hidden secret
Jump down to the left of the chest this will take you back close to where the Puzzle Pillar is

Feb
Luz France During the excavation of an old church Adam found a scroll that has Templar symbols
Adam deciphered it to show the location of the rivers mentioned in the Book of Genesis the Pishon Gihon Tigris and Euphrates
Where the rivers meet is the Gate of Eden
March With the funding of Clairvaux Corporation and skill of Professor Jacques Saint Omair they flew to the site and established a base camp at the Gate of Eden
At the Gate of Eden Gate of Eden Go forward and enter the cave
Climb down and go forward to talk to Evelyn

He says that the strange device in front of the gate is missing some essential parts
He noted the rocks blocking the way to a tunnel
Explosives Go back in front of the gate and pass Digger the dog
Talk to Digger optional Go to the dog and talk to him
Mix the explosives Go to bottom of screen and see a stand with small barrels at left
Use the stand to get a close up of the puzzle
See rows of small barrels
The top row has barrels with labels symbols at bottom of each barrel
The symbols on the frame at left shows the amount of powder from each barrel at top row needed to make the explosives
Study the amount released by the barrels on top to the middle row then middle to bottom and finally from bottom row to the dynamite
The top and bottom row release fixed amounts of powders
Check the solution by using the lever right of the stand
Top row releases fixed amounts of powder to the middle row triangle square splits to left and middle barrels circle to middle barrel and diamond
So the middle barrel contains left barrel triangle square middle barrel square circle and right barrel has diamond
If we do the middle barrels to release left barrel at half only middle barrel at full and right barrel at half only the bottom barrel at left will get triangle square and right barrel will get square circle diamond
The bottom row barrels release half of left barrel and quarter of right barrel
So the end mixture has at left barrel triangle square and the right barrel triangle circle diamond
Solution Turn the middle row left barrel to half middle barrel to full and right barrel to half
Pull lever at right of the stand to makeexplosive

The Walkthrough GENERALLY When you open the inventory you will find the collected items on the left and a column of standard icons on the right By quot standard quot I mean that you will see the same icons in that column no matter which quot page quot of the inventory you open While the use of most of the icons in this column is straightforward three deserve special mention
The Magnifying Glass icon Be sure to quot examine quot each item that you collect in the game This means doing two things First click on the item that you wish to examine and then on the magnifying glass icon that appears in the column on your right in the inventory page You will be shown a page with the picture of the item at the top an Eye icon in the center and a general description of the item at the bottom of the screen Second click on that Eye icon because it will provide you with additional information about the object and in some cases even an additional item that was concealed in the first object
The Gears icon Clicking on this icon takes you to what I call the gears section Whenever you want to assemble i e quot combine quot two or more objects click on one of these objects and then on the gears icon that appears in the column on your right in the inventory page You will be shown a page with four boxes in the left column a gears icon in the middle and a single box on the right Place the item in one of the four boxes on your left Go back to the inventory page by clicking on the Bag icon at the top of the column on your right Repeat the procedure as many times as necessary until you have placed all the items that you would like to combine in the four boxes on your left in the gears section Then click on the gears icon in the middle of the page and if you have the correct items the combined product will appear in the single box on your right If you would like toseparatetwo or more items joined together place the product in the single box on your right and click on the gears icon in the middle of the screen If the items can be separated the separated parts will then appear in the four boxes on your left
The Scrapbook Be sure to read the game booklet on how to use this icon because it can provide you with some really useful information Just click on the brown notebook on your right and it will take you to an index of all the sources of information available to you The topic quot The Challenge quot is especially useful if you decide toACCEPTPoirot's challenge because it will show your progress through the game The section quot Documents quot is equally important in order to actually read the documents that you collect in the game But again check out all the topics as early as possible in the game and feel free to refer to them throughout the game to get the most benefit enjoyment out of the information collected here for you

As the opening cutscenes end you must approach Poirot This is easier said than done because you will soon discover that he is not so easy to catch and other people keep blocking your way some of them asking you to do favors for them before they will allow you to pass
Indeed this particular sequence might seem silly to some while annoying to others Just keep in mind that in addition to perhaps being shown Poirot's idiosyncrasies you are being introduced to the characters that will soon serve as suspects in the murder mystery that awaits you aboard the train So when the cutscenes end move towards the two men that include the chef Klaus As you do the two men will block your way and the chef will ask you which of the two cleavers he holds in his hands is better for cleaving meat Choose the one in hisLEFThand He will compliment you and the two men will let you pass Note even if you choose the one on the right you will be allowed to guess again and then to pass
As the men step aside move forward A brief cutscene follows As it ends note that Poirot is standing on the right side of your screen Move towards him and he will walk away Note that he is now standing on the left side of your screen Click in that direction only to see him walk away while your own path will be blocked by two more men left Antonio Foscarelli right Cyrus Hardman Try to get past them and they will tell you about their argument You can choose whichever response you like from the two given but you must get them either one or both of the items they are asking for in order to get through
Step right right again and close up on the stall left of the heroine Pick up the large blue floweryKutahyaBowlin front of the heroine and step out of the close up by clicking on the footprints icon Go left and close up on the stall behind the large barrel and crates on your right Pick up the loneIznikTile standing upright and leaning against a stack of similar tiles in front of the heroine Step out of the close up and to the right past the chef right again and then left to return to the two men Click on the mouth icon to speak to them You can choose whichever response you like but I prefer the third one since we already have both items The two items will disappear from your inventory but don't worry about getting them back from the men to return to the vendors because for whatever reason you will not be able to do so
And no I have no idea merely guesses as to the reason for all that talk of returning the objects to the vendors when you never really get a chance to do so
With this dispute settled the two men will step aside Go left to find Poirot now standing to the left of two ladies right Princess Dragomiroff left Hildegarde Schmidt at the bottom of the screen Click on the mouth icon appearing on him But as the heroine calls him he will walk away and as the heroine hastens after him the ladies block her path You can choose whichever response you like but I prefer the fourth one because it is the politest and cuts the dialog short weknowthat we are going to have to get that parasol for the princess Note one of the times that I played this marketplace sequence the fourth line did not even appear If this happens feel free to choose whichever line seems best to you No matter how the dialog goes you need to get that parasol to get past these ladies
Click on the footprints icon appearing at the top of the screen to return to the two men Pick up theGrainfrom the right edge of the stall appearing to the left of the heroine Go to your right and click on the Eye icon appearing on the goat on your right You can see the parasol just behind the goat Bring out theGrainfrom the inventory and click on the goat The heroine will actually place the grain a little bit ahead of the goat As the goat moves ahead to eat it pick up theParasol Take two steps to your left to return to the ladies and speak to them
As the ladies step aside click on the footprints icon appearing at the bottom of the screen You will see a lady Greta Ohlsson standing on your right Try to go right and the lady will ask you for help Again you can choose any response you like but I prefer the second because it is the politest and moves the story forward
Go to your right Try to go left then to find two more men left Hector MacQueen right Samuel Ratchett standing in your way Ratchett is not nice at all So choose whichever responses you like until he agrees to let you pass
As these two men step aside click on the footprints icon appearing on the dark brown door just left of the heroine to arrive before the train station Enter the station and go left Step to your left again A cutscene follows Try to go left again You will overhear a short dialog between a man Colonel Arbuthnot and a woman Mary Debenham and then the two will step out of the way
Go left and then right Talk to the ticket collector Greta will step aside to find her own ticket but you can go forward now So go left quot To Train Platform quot Go left again to see Poirot talking to a train employee in the distance Step towards him A dialog follows
Click on Poirot and then on one of the first three choices
Choice just ends the dialog without any exchange of information between yourself and Poirot
Click on the train employee Pierre Michel and then on either the first or the second choice The other of these two choices will then be presented as the first choice Click on it and the heroine will finish the dialog
Note It might be a good idea toSAVEthe game at this point because the next time you address Michel it will be quite a while before you can save again and you might want to replay the cutscenes that follow the present dialog Therefore saving the game now will allow you to replay those cutscenes without having to repeat anything covered so far Click on Michel again Feel free to try out the other choices but keep in mind that the conversation will conclude as soon as the heroine tells Michel to let Poirot have her room A series of cutscenes then follows
Part One The Facts
The first cutscene runs like a movie ndash you have no control except to press quot Esc quot and skip the whole cutscene altogether It would be a good idea to see it at least once however because it gives us more information about the various guests on the train
You are given some control in the second cutscene in which you can select topics and use the left mouse button to skip individual lines of dialog Choose the topics in any order you like to gain information about the various guests as seen through the eyes of the great Poirot
The third cutscene is like a movie again and the only control you will have would be to press quot Esc quot to skip the whole thing altogether Once again though it would be a good idea to see the cutscene at least once because it shows a critical exchange between Ratchett and Poirot The cutscene continues following the quot loading quot of the game and this little part should especially not be skipped because it tells us that the heroine needs to acquire bacon for the chef in order to proceed in the game
As the controls are returned to you try to go left A brief cutscene follows Go left now and see two men standing by the fountain in the distance Click around the top of the screen to approach them and find them to be the Colonel and Hector MacQueen Click on the mouth icon to speak to them You can then click on either line of the dialog
In the next choice though click on the first line because it gives more information than the second As the men walk away go right and then click on the footprints icon appearing in the top right portion of the screen Another cutscene follows Click on the Eye icon appearing on the gate on your right to hear the heroine's comment
Go right and close up on the two men the Engineer and Michel on your right Talk to Michel pick the first choice and then exhaust the remaining topics one by one Next talk to the engineer Click on the back arrow to step out of this close up Go left and close up on the boxes on the cart on your left Try to click on the boxes in this close up only to find that the labels are in Serbian a language that you do not speak So step out of this close up and go right towards the Engineer and Michel Close up on those men again and speak to the Engineer first He does not know Serbian either So click on Michel and he agrees to help you out Step out of the close up go left and close up on the cart with the boxes again You can then click on any of the boxes and Michel will tell you what it contains As soon as you click on the second to the last box on the right the only one on that side on which the Eye icon appears Michel will tell you that we have found Klaus's bacon A cutscene follows
At the end of the cutscene the heroine is outside her room and Poirot's voice in the background tells us that we must eavesdrop on all the guests Click on one of the Ear icons that appear on the doors of the rooms left of yours The wood is too thick to hear what is going on inside however and we need something to help us So go to the Salon Car
Note We can go from one car to another in one of two ways One way would be to click on the footprints icon leading in the direction you wish to take until you reach that end of the car As you place your cursor on the connecting door between the cars a label will appear indicating the name of the car you are about to enter Click on the handle icon appearing on the door to then enter that car In the other method just move your cursor to the top of the screen A picture of the train with its several cars would appear As you move your cursor along those cars a label would show the name of each car over which your cursor is placed The label of the car where you are standing would indicate that fact by stating quot You Are Here quot At present all but two cars are quot grayed quot or ratherbrowned out indicating that you can access only two cars the Calais Coach where you are and the Salon Car If you just double click on the Salon Car you will find yourself there This would be the quickest way to reach another car especially when you are trying to get from one end of the train to the other
As you enter the Salon car click on the footprints icon appearing at the bottom of the screen to move forward Click on the footprints icon appearing at the top of the screen twice to move yet further in the car At this point you should find the bar on the left of the heroine Close up on the area behind the bar Pick up theIce Tongsfrom the left of the top shelf Then pick up theWater Glassstanding upright on the left of the second shelf and continuing through the row of unused glasses pick up more water glasses Open the drawer under these shelves and pick up thePaper Napkinsand theSelloTape Step out of the close up and return to the Calais Coach
Click on the footprints icon at the bottom of the screen to go past the bathroom on your right and arrive at the first set of rooms Bring out theWater Glassfrom your inventory place it on the door of the first room Calais Room Masterman amp Foscarelli and click to hear a dialog between the two men inside The heroine will withdraw at the end of this dialog Note You will not have to bring out the water glass for further eavesdropping From now on just click on the Ear icon appearing on a door and the heroine will bring out the glass automatically and lean against the door to listen
Feel free to click again on the Ear icon appearing on this door but the heroine will indicate that she has heard all that she could So click on the Ear icon appearing on the door of the next room Calais Room MacQueen As the heroine withdraws feel free to click again on the Ear icon appearing on this door but again the heroine will indicate that she has heard all that she could
Click on the Ear icon appearing on the door of the next room Calais Room Schmidt amp Debenham but the heroine cannot hear anything even the first time There will be no Ear icon on the door of your own room Calais Room Ohlsson amp Marceau So click on the footprints icon appearing at the bottom of the screen to move to the next set of rooms Calais Room Poirot Calais Room Ratchett andCalais Room Hubbard See what you can hear in each of these rooms and then click on the footprints icon appearing at the top right corner of the screen to move to the next set of rooms
Thus continue your eavesdropping of the rooms one by one until you reach the last room in this car Calais Room Hardman The heroine cannot hear anything but just as she withdraws from the door Michel catches her in the act A brief dialog follows but you don't have to do anything because the heroine will take care of it herself As Michel starts to walk away however place the cursor on him and find the icon of a silhouette in a circular frame trailing him This is what you might call the quot Follow this Person quot icon So click on this icon and the heroine will follow Michel all the way to the Baggage Car
You can then choose to move in any direction you like but the result will be the same Michel will appear and ask the heroine if she is following him Choose whichever response you like but again the result will be the same Michel will ask you to return to the Calais Coach and state that he would lock up this car So click at the bottom of the screen quot To Restaurant Car quot and a cutscene will show Michel locking up the door to the Baggage Car
Go right and then click on the footprints icon at the bottom of the screen to move further down into the Restaurant Car Close up on the large table laid out with food on your left and pick up theSpirit Lamp There is nothing else left to do for now So click on the Calais Coach at the top of the screen to quickly return to that car Move down further and enter your room Calais Room Ohlsson amp Marceau Step further into your room and a series of cutscenes will follow
At the end of the cutscenes feel free to choose whichever response you like to Greta's question Step out of your room note the unusual handle icon at your door Another cutscene follows and this one also ends with the heroine in her room Greta is asleep this time so just step out of the room Yet another cutscene follows and also ends with the heroine in her room Step out yet again to see a brief cutscene of a woman in a red kimono Click on the quot Follow this Person quot icon to go after her but she seems to disappear at the end of the car We must determine who she is But both the connecting door to the Salon Car and the bathroom on your right are locked and if you try to enter the room of any of the guests Michel will tell you not to disturb the passengers Go to him at the other end of this car and click on the newly added Athens Paris Coach to learn from him why that is locked Note that the bathroom on this side is also locked Click on Michel choose the first line of the dialog and exhaust all topics one by one thereafter At the end of the dialog return to your room As you click on the door another cutscene follows
At the end of the cutscene we find the heroine in Poirot's compartment Another man Dr Constantine is also present You may click on either the doctor or Poirot but clicking on Poirot would provide more information As always pick the first topic and exhaust the rest one by one Whether you click on Poirot or the doctor Poirot will offer you a challenge The following walkthrough assumes that youacceptedthat challenge
Following a brief cutscene you will now find the heroine in the victim Ratchett's room If you open the inventory and click on the brown notebook the quot Scrapbook quot you will find a new heading quot The Challenge quot has been added As you progress through the game especially after completing a Part be sure to check this section of the scrapbook because it will actually note the points that you earn through the successful completion of various tasks Be sure to also refer to the section quot M Poirot's Instructions quot throughout the game to help determine the tasks that need to be completed

Click on the victim's luggage up in the carrier on your right As the suitcase is opened for you click inside to recover aSleeping Draught quot Regardez Mademoiselle quot You can click in the suitcase again just to make sure that there is nothing else of interest in there but the heroine will tell you that there is not So step out of this close up and click on the footprints icon to turn around and face the other side of the room Click on the jacket hanging on the left of the exit to recover aMatchbox Pick up theHathanging on the right of the same door Finally pick up thePipecleaner looks like a white straw from the floor just left of the bed

So long as we are in this car let's see what we can find here Don't worry There is no timed sequence to restore the heat so we can get a few things done along the way
Feel free to check the bathroom on your left but there is nothing of interest there There is no use trying to talk to Matteo because you will not get anything useful out of him until the heat is restored So click on the footprints icon at the bottom of the screen to go left in the train

Return to the corridor and enter the vacantAthens Room Pick up what looks like a crumpled white rag from the floor lying slightly to the left front of the bedside table It turns out to be a torn note As you pick it up the heroine indicates that we must piece it together We are presented with an assembly area
The pieces of the note are on the left and must be put together in the frame on the right At the bottom of that frame there are two arrows When you click on a piece it will turn yellow or is quot activated quot You can then use the LEFT and RIGHT ARROWS at the bottom of the frame to turn the activated piece around until it appears to be upright With your thumb still pressed on the left mouse button the so called quot click and hold quot technique drag the piece to the frame on your right Hint It will be easier to assemble the note if you first try to arrange the corner pieces of the note as shown below
As soon as you correctly place the last piece in the frame all the pieces will fit together and the heroine will indicate that she will put the note in her scrapbook Step out of the close up open the scrapbook and go to the Documents section where you will find the above note under the heading quot Torn Letter quot The completed note reads as follows Calais Coach Diagram with an asterisk and an quot R quot marking Ratchett's room in the train

Murder on the Orient Express Walkthrough by Tally Ho Autumn The opening cutscene shows a squad of policemen arresting a couple who were hiding in a house in New Paltz NY
You may be left wondering just what is going on and what it has to do with the Orient Express
It will gradually become clear throughout the storytelling that this couple was suspected of kidnapping a little girl named Daisy Armstrong and that the kidnapping is somehow connected with the events that take place on the train ten years later
Jump forward in time to Istanbul Turkey
You Antoinette Marceau have been assigned to see to the comfort and safety of M Hercule Poirot famed detective
Your job hangs in the balance
Try to follow Poirot and you are detained briefly by a pair of men one of whom is arguing over which cleaver is better
Select a cleaver to get by them
The left one is better but you can select either one
Follow Poirot who seems to want to be on his way without having any conversation
Your way is blocked again by a pair of men arguing over which tiles are more beautiful Kutahya or Iznik
Now they want you to bring them a sample to settle the question
You can find Kutahya porcelains by retracing your route two steps back and looking close up at the vendor's wares
He is distracted and won't notice if you borrow one of his vases
If you'd rather get a piece of Iznik tile you will find it back where you began behind and to the right of the two men with the cleavers
You don't need both samples one will do
Show it to the men
If you happened to collect both styles you will have to return one of them
If you collected only one you can forget about returning it
The men step out of your way
Before you go anywhere see the cart of grain sacks at the left
One of the sacks is leaking and you can take some loose grain
Continue on your way and try to speak to Poirot
He hurries away and your way is blocked by Frau Schmidt and Princess Dragomiroff
She has lost her parasol
Retrace your steps twice to the intersection where the two goats are grazing in the street
What's that behind the upper goat
Looks like a parasol
Give the goat some grain to get her to move
Right click to open inventory select the grain left click on the return arrow at the lower left to close inventory and left click when you see the Gears Icon to use the grain on the goat
You can take the parasol and return it to the Princess
Continue but your progress is impeded once more by a frumpy Swedish lady who wants directions to the train
Try to refuse if you wish but eventually you will have to agree that she can come with you
She follows as you are held up once more by Mr Ratchett and another gentleman
Threaten him with the police and you will be allowed to proceed
Enter the door to the station
Make your way through the station
You will overhear Mary say No not now when it's behind us Then
Talk to the Ticket Master
Oops Greta can't find hers
Go on without her
Finally meet Hercule Poirot who is having trouble getting on the train because it is full
Talk to Poirot
Talk to Pierre Michel the Conductor
Settle the matter by offering M Poirot your own room
You will share Greta Ohlsson's compartment
By the way any time you are in the room you share with Greta you can look at the clock on the nightstand and see what time it is
Sit back and absorb the story line as it unfolds in the cutscenes
As you dine with Poirot you will observe the occupants of the car drawing conclusions from their behavior and appearance
Following that you will see the Chef ranting about a shortage of bacon
It will be your job to find some bacon as the train is stopped in Belgrade
Step forward
Very briefly you see a man in an attendant's uniform running and boarding the Restaurant Car
Step forward twice more and you can speak with Colonel Arbuthnot and Hector MacQueen
Continue along the platform
You see a woman leave
She was probably seeing the attendant off
Continue and speak to Tayyip the engineer and Pierre
Heavy snow is forecast
Look at the containers on the wagon
All the labels are in Serbian
Ask Tayyip to translate
He's a Turk no help
Ask Pierre
He can help
Golf balls toilet paper carrot juice and aha
Bacon at last
Let's be on our way
Poirot's advice was to eavesdrop was it not
The doors are thick and you cannot hear through them with just your ears
You need something to amplify the sound
Exit the Calais Coach into the Salon Car
There is no one around they are all in their rooms
Find the bar and go behind it
Take five of the thin glasses
One will be your tool for eavesdropping the others will come in handy later
Take the ice tongs on the shelf above the glasses then open the drawer and take the Sellotape and paper napkins
Return to the Calais Coach and start listening in on people
I suggest doing the rooms in order so as to not miss anything important
You should listen at every door even when you know its occupant is elsewhere
Otherwise you will not be fulfilling your assignment
Here's what you find Cabin Masterman amp Foscarelli Hear Antonio Foscarelli the Italian and Cyrus Hardman the American playing cards and talking about Masterman Cabin MacQueen Hear Hector MacQueen the young American and Colonel Francis Arbuthnot talk about politics Cabin Schmidt Debenham Nothing
Mary Debenham must be sleeping and Frau Schmidt is with the Princess Cabin Poirot Nothing
Poirot is sleeping Cabin Ratchett Hear Ratchett and Masterman talk about what Ratchett is reading Cabin Hubbard No sound
Mrs Caroline Hubbard the American is sleeping Cabin Countess Andrenyi Listen to Count Rudolf and Countess talk about nightmare Cabin Count Andrenyi No sound
The Count is next door with the Countess Cabin Princess Dragomiroff Listen to Schmidt reading to the Princess Cabin Arbuthnot Nothing
Arbuthnot is with MacQueen Cabin Hardman Hardman is with Foscarelli
Check your own room
Greta had given some headache powder to the American woman
You may feel stuck at this point
Go through the Salon Car and into the Restaurant Car
Find Pierre Michel at the far end and click the shadow icon on him
You will follow into the Baggage Car where he will send you back to your own car and lock the baggage car
What was he really doing in there
Oh
The avalanche occurs and everyone is shaken up
Poirot is flung out of bed and suffers a sprained ankle
Shortly after a cry and a call bell are heard
The time is Exit your room and a brief cutscene shows the attendant answering Mr Ratchett's bell It is nothing


In your room again and this time an insistent call bell is ringing
The time is
Look in the corridor and see Mrs Hubbard complaining about a man in her room
In your room again five minutes later hear a thud
Look in the corridor
Michel is in his chair and a woman in a red kimono walks into the Salon Car
You can try to use the shadow icon to follow her but the door is locked
Talk to Michel
He hasn't seen her face but she came from one of the rooms in the middle of the car
Return to your room and watch the cutscene of passengers having breakfast and griping about the delay
Michel will finally interrupt and call you to Poirot's room
Ach
There has been a murder
Talk to the men
You will be given the choice of carrying out the investigation on your own or do it with Poirot's help
Either choice is okay doing it on your own means you get points for solving something with no help and lose points when you need assistance
It doesn't really matter
I've played the game both ways and prefer not to bother with the points scheme
Make your choice and the game will proceed into the dead man's room
See the multiple stab wounds and take the smashed pocket watch from his pajamas
Lift the pillow and find the gun
Talk to Constantine to learn what you can
It's mysterious
So many wounds some deep some barely scratches some deep ones didn't bleed much and some were delivered by the left hand
Following the conversation look around the room
Lots of clues here
Take the handkerchief from the floor and the teeth glass statue and contents of the ashtray from the nightstand
The ashtray held a cigar butt a flat match a round match and a piece of burnt paper
Turn around and pick up the pipe cleaner from the floor near the door
Take the hat from the hook to the right of the door
Look in the coat and find a box of round matches
Look in his suitcase and find the sleeping potion
You've found everything there is to find in this room and some of it is pretty important stuff
Open your inventory and examine things by placing them on the magnifying glass
Be sure to look at both sides of each object
The handkerchief is very fine lace and embroidered with the letter 'H'The glass shows powder and a smudgeThe watch is broken and stopped at The sleeping draught is half empty
Or is that half full The statue is lightweight
It must be conducive
Or should she say conductive The round match and the flat match are both used as is the pipe cleaner There is a paper in the hatband that says Rev
Sounds like a reference to a Bible verse Look out the window and see the footprints
Look at the windowsill and hear Very Interesting
Keep track of the Interesting places you will come back to them to get fingerprints
Go see Poirot
If you have found all the clues in Ratchett's room and talked about them with Poirot he will suggest further examination of the burnt scrap of paper
You need several items Jump to the restaurant car and go to the far end
Take the Spirit Lamp from the serving table
You could talk to all the people but let's not just yet
While they are all assembled in the restaurant would be a good time to search their rooms
Return to the Calais Coach and have a look around
I suggest doing the rooms in order as before to make it easier keeping track
Cabin Door locked Cabin Door locked Cabin Check the hatbox on the overhead rack and see the hat frame is not the right kind Open and take the small latched box from Schmidt's suitcase

Look under the bed and take the broken snowshoes Look in Dr Constantine's room Take the Passport from the nightstand look in his suitcase and take the announcement of his upcoming lecture

Easiest way to get there is to jump to the Restaurant Car and walk to the front end
Go beyond the kitchen and into the Baggage Car
Use the key to get in
Look at all the crates
Remember where the one is that is Quite Interesting
Find the crate that is labeled Two Pair
It also has a Quite Interesting spot
The lid is secured with four nails
Use the hammer to pull the nails
Look in the crate
You have found the other pair of snowshoes
These are not damaged
Look at them in inventory
See that they are tightly bound with a length of copper wire
Click them on the Gears Icon
Place the snowshoes on the single box
Click the gear to separate the shoes from the wire
Look at the wire in the magnifying glass
Copper wire like this mist be conducive for something
Did she mean to say conductive
Exit the crate and continue one step forward in the car
You see a clipboard on the left and three barrels on the right
Inspect the barrels
One of vinegar one of olive oil and one of honey
Read the clipboard
It mentions the three barrels and a special security package loaded in Istanbul
Go to the forward end of the car
Try to enter the secure room
It's locked
Inspect the door handle
Probably a fingerprint there
Jump to the Calais coach jump out Ratchett's window again
Walk to the rear of the train screen left and then go right into the forest
You will come to a screen where there is a big central rock and three exits NW NE and S You cannot proceed without snowshoes
We will call this the Base Rock
Take the good pair of snowshoes out of inventory and click them on yourself
Exit to the northeast upper right
A wolf blocks your way

Use the hammer to take the loose bar
Use the bar to force the padlock
Enter the cabin and take the attendant's uniform lying there
Inspect it with the magnifying glass
Look at both sides
It is a Petite
You find another passkey
Walk to the other side of the hut
Take the Stiletto that somebody stuck in the chair Look at the stove and use the pliers to take a piece of the stovepipe
To return from the cabin Exit the door thenSouth South Southeast Southwest At the fallen tree South Southeast Southeast
This should get you to the Base Rock
Southwest
Southwest again takes you to the rear of the train
Do not enter the train rather walk forward to the Coal Tender and insert the stovepipe where the steam is leaking
You will automatically return to the Calais Coach outside Poirot's room
Jump to the Restaurant car and go to the serving table at the far end
Take the blank menu cards
Also take the butter knife
Try going into the kitchen
Klaus is in a state because he does not have enough oil and vinegar
Continue into the Baggage car and go to the three barrels
Use your two spouts to tap the barrels
Fill a glass tumbler with oil and another with vinegar
Return to the kitchen and give them to Klaus
It's not enough vinegar
He goes to the baggage car giving you the chance to explore the kitchen
Take the cleaver
Open the refrigerator and take the orange juice
Open the drawer under the fresh bread and take the turkey baster
Cross the kitchen and take the cake batter
You still need to collect the rest of the passports and lift all the fingerprints you can If you're ever unsure whether you have someone's passport or not go to inventory and click on the middle icon that looks like a book and select Suspects
A list of all people will appear with icons showing which passports you have
It also shows whose prints you have
Just keep in mind that one passenger is using a fake passport and you will need to find the real one
In order to collect fingerprints you must have found the blank menu cards and the typewriter ribbon for ink
In addition some people will object to getting their fingers dirty so you must have the paper napkins also
Klaus is nearest you might as well settle with him first
You already have his passport
Go find him in the baggage car and talk with him
You will collect his fingerprints
He's not interested in further conversation
There was nobody in the restaurant right
Some people are in their rooms and some are in the Salon
Jump to the Salon Car
The first person you come to is Miss Debenham
Talk to her
Remember to always talk about everything possible with each person
When you're done with her speak with the Count and Countess

She didn't actually hand you her passport during the conversation remember to take it from the nightstand when you are finished talking
Enter your own room and take the Bible from the nightstand
Talk to Greta
Inspect her suitcase and take the postcard from Coney Island
As you talk with various people you will begin to notice little inconsistencies in their stories
Keep using those little gray cells
Go to room and talk to Miss pain in the butt Hubbard
She balks at every question but eventually you get the job done
After the conversation she heads to the bar and you are free to explore the room
I could use a Martini too after dealing with her
If you have all the equipment needed to lift prints you can start collecting fingerprints from various objects
If you have not done so go to inventory and smash the lump of coal into dust by combining it with the hammer in the gears device
Now fill the turkey baster with coal dust by combining them in the gears device
Turn around and inspect the doorknob to the connecting room
Use the baster to dust the print then lift it with the Sellotape
In the US it's called Scotch Tape
Harry Potter calls it Spellotape
Cute huh
The Count and Countess are in the Salon
enter her room and look in the suitcase
There is nothing interesting in it but see that the label conceals the initials H M K
Go see Princess Dragomiroff in room
She's not there but her passport is along with a copper arthritis bracelet
Take them
Oops she really is there
Must have been in the Loo
Finally talk to Arbuthnot take Hardman's passport and talk to Michel about everything
I don't know about you but when I travel I don't leave my passport lying around
Go to the Athens Paris coach
Assuming you came through here before and collected passports you can skip to Michel's room room
You catch Hardman going through Pierre's things
Take the key from him
Talk to him
Go to room and get Dr Constantine's prints
Go the end of the car and talk to Matteo
Go outside and talk to the Fireman and the Engineer
Yes you have to trek all the way to the front of the train
Stop complaining it's cold out here and the sooner you get done the sooner you can go inside where it's warm
If you have been diligent you should now have all the passports and all the suspect's prints
It's time to talk to Hercule Poirot
It's slightly faster to enter the train through Ratchett's window if you don't mind the dead body
Unfortunately even though it looks like you have everybody's passport the Hardman one is a fake
You will need to go to his room Calais and look under the nightstand
You will find his ID card and a letter from Ratchett along with the passport
This one lists his occupation as Private Investigator
Jump to the baggage car and walk to the far end
Use the little key to open the secure room
Before you go in inspect the door handle
Interesting
Use the baster and the tape to get a print
Enter the room and look at the large crate to your right
Open it with the iron bar from the hut
Inspect the bed
Take the uniform and look at it in inventory
Look at the books and dust them for prints
Back away from the interior of the crate and inspect the latch at the top
Dust it for prints
Exit the crate and go to the Safe
Know the combination
Inspect the inside of Ratchett's hat if you have not yet done so
It says Rev
sounds like a Bible verse
At first I thought the combination was or something like that but no you have to look up the quotation and get your clue from that
When I first played this game I had not found Greta's bible at the time so a quick Google search helped me
However if you have her bible in your inventory look at it in the Magnifying glass and turn it over
You will place the appropriate page in your documents
It says the number of the beast is six hundred threescore and six
Of course you need to know that one score is twenty so the combination is
Left Right Left
When Antoinette hears it click that's it
Open the safe and take the document
It's Ratchett's confession
In the baggage car itself look at the snowshoe crate
Click on the label to get a closeup then dust for prints
Also get a print from the open crate above the cabbages
You have many more prints to collect Do them in any order you like just as long as you get them all
Calais coach Rm
Ratchett the window latchRm
Hubbard the door handle to the connecting room
Athens coach Rm
the handle bars on the leftandthe silver vase on the nightstand
In inventory The thick tumbler the stiletto the broken padlock and the broken snowshoes
The procedure to get prints from inventory items is a bit tedious Click the baster on the gears to get it to the combination utilityPut it into a square on the left Select the desired item from inventory click it on the gears and place it in a square on the left Click the central gear to combine them
The baster returns to inventory and the item is dusted Place the dusted item into a square on the left Get the tape from inventory click it on the gears place it in a square on the left andClick the central gear to combine them getting a print
Climb out Ratchett's window and look at the footprints
Pour the cake batter into the depression
Use the ice tongs to pick up the frozen batter
Click the casting on the gears and place it in a square on the left
Take the ice bucket from inventory and click it on the gears
Place it on the left then click the central gear icon to combine the frozen footprint with ice preserving it
It would melt if you went into the warm train without putting it on ice
You need to visit all the occupied rooms and compare the casting with their shoes
Shoes are found in those quarter round corner closets in each room
You must also compare the fingerprints you have lifted from all objects with the prints you took from all the suspects
You discover the following matches Books from Ratchett's crate matches no one in the file Rachette's crate latch matches MacQueen Security room handle matches Michel Small snowshoes crate matches Foscarelli Empty crate matches Foscarelli Window sill of Ratchett's cabin matches Foscarelli Doorknob of Hubbard's connecting door matches Greta Handle bar in Cabin in Athens Paris coach matches Arbuthnot Flower vase matches Debenham Broken padlock from hut matches Matteo Thick tumbler matches Masterman Stiletto matches no one in the file Broken snowshoes matches Arbuthnot
I found a bug
While in Princess Dragomiroff's room she is not there but she will talk to you if you click on the bed
Part Three Poirot Sits Back and Thinks Report to Poirot what you have found
You need to talk to everybody again
This time you will put together some inconsistencies in their stories and learn that everybody's story seems linked to the others
If people won't talk to you and you feel stuck there is something that you have omitted
Be sure you have collected all the possible prints thirteen in all and that you have tested all of them
When you are ready to proceed you will have seen a brief cutscene of the plow train arriving
Start by searching for Michel
Perhaps he is in the room with the ham radio
Jump to the Athens Paris coach and look in room
Look out the window and a man is briefly seen
Go outside to see who it was and Antoinette will be kidnapped and locked in the hut
Observe that the broken padlock from your own inventory was used to lock the door
Check your inventory
All your possessions are gone
Look around the hut
Find Princess Dragomiroff's parasol under the cot
Look out the window
The lock is out of your reach but with the aid of the parasol you should be able to dislodge the lock and escape
Outside the weather appears to be worsening
I'm not sure if you need to pick up the broken lock again but it's evidence after all
I recommend taking it
Look in the box and voila you have all your things back
All except the little key to the secure room that is
Put the snowshoes on and get back into that nice warm train
It's cocktail hour
Jump to the Salon car and talk with everyone who will give you the time
MacQueen and Arbuthnot are sitting together an odd combination if you ask me
Talk to both of them
Aha Debenham had lied she had been to America and she was the Armstrong's Governess Foscarelli is playing Solitaire
Talk to him
Come clean he was their chauffeur Go further into the car
Take the Punchbowl from the bar if you have not already done so Talk to Hubbard
She's not much help Talk to Hardman
He's not much help either
Creep Debenham won't talk just now
Go to the restaurant
Talk to the Count
He doesn't say much
Talk to the Countess
Aha
She's not being very truthful is she
She turns out to be Daisy's auntie
The nurse was Neudotter
Talk to Mastermann
Oops he and Tonio worked together
Talk to Dr Constantine
He's insulted at being questioned
Go further into the car
Talk to the Princess
The handkerchief is hers
The H is not an H at all it's the letter N represented in the Cyrillic alphabet
She says H is written as N
She really should say 'N' is written as 'H' Talk to Frau Schmidt
Fifteen years would give her an alibi ten would not
Enter the kitchen and talk to Grumpy Klaus
Gadzooks who on earth would steal his cake batter imagine
That's about it for the people for now
You have not been in your own room for quite a while
Let's see if everything is in order
Go to Calais
Check your own luggage and discover that someone has planted the red kimono in your room
Of all the nerve
Report to M Poirot
Talk about everything
Before you exit his room look in his luggage and read the letter from Barnaby
When it is time to continue go to Athens Paris where the ham radio is
Don't worry you won't be kidnapped again
If you look close at the radio she says there's no power
Go to inventory and find the butter knife
You are going to create a telegraph key
Put the butter knife into the gears utility and also put the pliers there
Combine them to bend the knife
Now combine the bent knifeandthe large nailsandthe hammer to build the key
In inventory combine the copper wire with the pliers to get a cut piece of wire
Place the key on the table in front of the radio
Use the cut copper wire to attach the key to the radio
Next place that gorgeous glass punchbowl on the table next to the radio
Pour the orange juice into the bowl
It's a source of acid
Place the small statuette in the juice
In inventory use the copper bracelet and the pliers in the gears utility to bend the bracelet
Place the bent bracelet in the juice
Different metals in acid can generate an electric current sort of a battery
You don't need to attach the wires they seem to know how to do that themselves
Turn on the radio
Click on the key
It's easy to talk to Barbaby because you have read the book
Quick study huh
Ask him all the questions
He'll research everything
Whew
He must have nothing else to do
Turn off the radio back away from the radio and return
Voila he's done all his homework
Talk about every subject
One more thing ask him to research Armstrong
Leave and return as before
Now you are done with the radio
Talk to four more people
Debenham will talk now
She admits being governess Constantine feels qualified as a people doctor but is really a veterinarian Countess tells more about her sister Greta Admits being the nurse
Talk to Poirot about everything and the denouement will begin
Answer his questions
You know most of the answers and if you give a wrong answer keep going until you find the right one
It's not hard
It only matters if you are counting points
Finally talk about the three endings
I prefer to select them in the order three two one for a better flow to the story
In the unlikely event you finished this game and didn't shed a tear you have a heart of stone indeed
Best Holiday wishes to all my faithful readers

I who has been given the chance to glance among the pages of truth have prepared to fight the evil the demonic Black King and to bury all that which tempts all our lives when my mission comes to its end
I have no power left to plant the seeds of the unknown games and to look after their growth and spread but it is my mission to find all those places where the last masters of the lost board games live and to mark these places with a strange stone which shows the way
The families of the masters will forever conserve the knowledge and will wait for the day when a stranger fulfils what fate intended for me
He will collect the games and will show what peaceful solutions the world knows instead of weapons and wars and for man to measure his strength and ability with his fate to quench his passion
The long shut doors of the masters open before the brave who says I am in search of the Agon

Tablut Read the rules
The white King that is at the center of the board must reach a shaded corner
For the King's white counters to capture the black opponent white counters must surround a black enemy vertically or horizontally or between a white counter and a shaded corner
The King is defeated if he is surrounded on all sides by black counters or if the King is beside the throne central shaded square he can be surrounded on sides by a black counter
Play the game The King is solid blue his counters are blue and white and the enemies are red and white
The strategy I used is to try to empty a space at one enemy wall and the projected corner square the king will go to The king's counters are moved to block the space around the area that is being cleared and to remove the enemies
The King is moved one step off the throne or central square parallel to the target wall before going to that wall
The path that is cleared should get the King to move to the wall in one or moves and to the corner square in another move
Have fun
You can also go to Main Menu and set the game difficulty on easy mode
Click apply and play
It will be easier to solve the Tablut game
This solution might take a long way around but it works on the 'easy' mode

Episode London At the end of the opening cut scene you find yourself in the office of Professor Samuel Hunt our hero at the British Museum in London Look down to see some papers at the very corner of the table in front of you Close up on those papers The professor mumbles quot Ah this must have been Smythe quot So read the letter by that man first the two white pages starting with quot Dear Friend quot We learn that Smythe is the museum director's secretary and a friend of the professor Make a note of his phone number on the second page of the letter
Step out of the close up on Smythe's letter and click on the newspaper next Read the article appearing on the lower left corner under the picture quot Is the British Museum keeping some secrets quot Note for the quot discerning quot gamers We were given the date of October at the end of the opening cut scene The P S
in Smythe's letter stated that he had brought quot today's newspapers quot Yet the date of this newspaper is quot for the week ending Saturday October
quot Obviously it is not likely that a newspaper would have been deliveredeightdays in advance So the date at the beginning must be a typo Ignore this discrepancy however because neither of these dates is really relevant to the story anyway The year is all that matters as we shall shortly see
Listen to another comment by the professor as you put away the paper Then click on the thick white envelope Read the anonymous letter signed W K and then click on the yellow page to the left that is still inside the white envelope This is the first of the three pages of the Mysterious Codex you will collect in this installment of the game Step out of the close up and the page will be deposited in the professor's files
Note You can always look at the documents collectedduring a particular episodeby clicking on quot F quot on the dial you see at the upper right hand corner of the screen You will then be shown a page or table of contents listing the collected documents Just click on the document that you would like to see again Note also however that once you go on to the next episode the documents collected in the previous episode will no longer be available for viewing But don't worry you won't need to refer to a document from an earlier episode after you have successfully completed that episode
Step out of the close up on the table corner and the professor will indicate that he must let Smythe know about this i e the mysterious letter and its attachment So turn around step towards the door and click on the gear icon to open the door and step out into the corridor The professor indicates that the only phone available at this time of the night is in the Director's Office So turn left and go to that office at the end of the corridor As you click on the door however you find that it is locked So turn around again and go all the way down to theoppositeend of the corridor Step to your left and turn around left to find a door with the sign quot Back Staircase quot on the wall to the left of that door Approach this door close up on the keyhole and note the key in there You will realize the relevance of this fact later
Step out of the close up and click on the door to come out at the head of the staircase Go downfourflights of stairs reaching the ground level Step through the door and look around to your right to find the guard Swanson sitting behind a desk
Step up to him and then turn around left to face the man across the desk Now click on the speech icon appearing on Swanson to talk to him At the end of the conversation he allows you to look at the inventory ledger You will be shown a brief glimpse of this notebook during the conversation itself As the dialogue ends look down at the edge of the table closest to you and click on the brown battered notebook Flip through the pages but realize that you don't have enough information yet about what you are looking for to be able to see in which of the four warehouses you will find it Note however the comment on the left page at the very end of the notebook Dr Moresby's new safety key is the one with the green ribbon This information will come in handy later
Talk to Swanson again At the end of this conversation he gives you the key to the Director Moresby's office so that the professor can supposedly call his wife to let her know that he will be working late again tonight Go back upstairs bring out the key from your inventory and click on the door to unlock it and enter the Director's office
It is dark inside So turn around and click on the gear icon to the right of the door to switch on the lights
The camera will automatically pan from the light switch back to the view in front of you to show you the essentials of the room As the camera stops panning the professor will make a comment about Smythe's quot invaluable treasures quot So this is actually Smythe's office If you look down to your right you will find three flyers on the little round table Feel free to leaf through those flyers Further down the same wall you will find a filing cabinet Step forward and turn right to look at it Only one of the drawers is unlocked the second one from the top on the right side Open it to find only one file that you can pick up Feel free to examine it to find a letter as well as two pages giving a brief history of the British Museum Nothing you need in your quest Step out of the close ups and look to your left now There is a little cabinet under the window with a tea set sitting on top Step towards the window and close up on the cabinet below to open it quot Let us see one of Smythe's treasures quot Pick up the big dark square bottle of whiskey from the right on the upper shelf
Step out of the close up and turn around We will ignore Smythe's desk on your right for now Go past it to the double doors instead and enter the Director's office itself This room is dark as well Turn around and click on the light switch to theleftof the double doors Again the camera will give you a panoramic view of the room There are four sets of bookcases to your left a fireplace in the wall in front of you and a large desk to the right of the fireplace Feel free to go along the bookcases and examine the few books you will be allowed to pick up from two of these bookcases Next go over to the fireplace and pick up a box of matches you will find to the left of the candle holder on the mantel Turn right now and goaroundbehind the large desk Close up on the top of the desk Click on Moresby's business card lying on the left side of the desk You don't need his number though so put it back Pick up the blue rubber stamp from the top center of the desk behind and to the left of a glass bottle Finally click on the old fashioned phone to your right A key pad will appear to your right as the operator will ask you for a phone number Use the key pad to click in Smythe's number You do not have to press quot Enter quot Sit back then and listen to the conversation between the two men
As the conversation ends step out of the close up on the desk and look left anddownat the wastebasket sitting on the floor next to the desk Close up on this wastebasket and pick up the crumpled piece of paper lying inside Based on what you have learned from Smythe you know exactly what you are looking for now quot Black granite sculpture sitting figure quot You will find this item listed on the third line from the bottom of the page Make a note of the number appearing to the right of this entry You will need this number later
Note also the date on the left for this item October
Go back out to the corridor quot but the door is left open 'accidentally' hellip quot Go downstairs and talk to Swanson again A cut scene follows in which the professor gives Swanson the bottle of whiskey The guard starts to drink and nod off already But you need to wait for him to be completely out before you can do anything sneaky So you must bide your time until then Look at the inventory book again As you open it you see that the first page on the left is for the year and that on the right is for the year Turn the page and note that the left page is for the year the year of this story As you look down the list of items on this page you find only one entry for quot sculptures utensils quot The date for the entry is right as well October same as the one noted in the crumpled page in Moresby's wastebasket So now we learn that we should find the statue in Store D Go back upstairs to Smythe's office and step behind his desk Close up on the top of the desk and pick up an quot ORDER quot form from the top tray on your left quot Yes I was looking for something like this quot The form will appear on your left as a key pad appears on your right Note the dark vertical line after the words quot inventory number quot on the form This is our cursor indicating where the letters we type will go in Use the key pad to click in the number we had noted from the crumpled page in Moresby's wastebasket The cursor automatically moves over to the next place of entry after quot Store quot ClickD the storage room that should have our sculpture according to the inventory notebook Be sure to now press quot ENTER quot on the key pad to register your input with the computer The accuracy of your data is confirmed when the professor comments quot I just need to certify it now quot Open your inventory click on the rubber stamp and then clickjust above the words quot locus sigilli quot The professor exclaims quot That's it quot indicating we are done
Go back downstairs to find Swanson keeled over his desk Step towardsthe key cabineton the wall to the guard's left and a cut scene will kick in After the cut scene turn around left and click on the cabinet to open it You will find that there are eight key slots but only six keys lying at the bottom of the cabinet Recall that we had found the key to the Back Staircase door already in its keyhole upstairs The label for the key slot second from the left down in the second row of the cabinet has been scratched off Hence we need to concentrate only on the six remaining key slots Here is where each key goes Main Building Put the key with the tag marked MB under this label
Dr Moresby As noted previously the key with the green ribbon goes here
Store A Put the clean silver colored key under this label
Store B The key with the two smaller keys attached to it goes here
Store C The key with a smaller key attached to it goes here
Store D Put the rusty key under this label
As you place the last key the professor's comment will confirm that you have made the right selection and the rusty key for Store D will be deposited in your inventory
You need to go down the corridor facing Swanson's desk In order to do this you will have to step towards the back staircase door and then to the left to come back around in front of the desk Turn right now and taketwosteps forward down the corridor Turn around to your left and pick up the lantern sitting on top of a pile of crates almost behind you Turn around right back in the direction you had been taking and take another step down the corridor Turn right then and close up on the crooked sign to the right of the door in front of you It says Storage Room D Step out of the close up click on the rusty key in your inventory and then on the double doors to enter the storage room
It is pitch dark inside and the professor says so Open your inventory and click first on the matchbox and then on the lantern to light the lantern Note The lantern itself stays in the inventory but you have light now
We need to go all the way down to the wall on ourleft but this is somewhat tricky The best way to do this is to pan a little bit to your right and click on the arrow pointing to the left side of the room This takes you to the entrance to the next to the last aisle on the left side of the room But we want to go to the very last aisle not this one so don't go in any further Rather turn around left and click on the arrow that points further to what is now to your right
Click on the wall you now see in front of you to finally reach the side of the room you had wanted to reach all along Turn right and take two steps downthisaisle to reach the end of the aisle Turn right again and you will see moonlight coming from a couple of windows up in the wall to your left Take one step forward and then click on the forward arrow to take another one when a cut scene will bring you to a granite figure in a sitting position on the floor The figure has its arms wrapped around a square diagram
Close up on that diagram Pick up the gray stone lying in the lower left portion of the diagram quot I must solve the message of the stone quot Click on the X quot Exit quot at the lower left corner of the screen to step out of this particular close up Step out of the other close up in the usual way by clicking on the down arrow at the bottom of the screen Go out of the storage room and back up to the professor's office In case you might have forgotten how to get there As you step through the back staircase door upstairs turn right and step forward Turn right again and take another step forward The professor's office will be immediately to your left
There is a large bookcase with three subdivisions on the right side of the room As you approach this bookcase feel free to examine the few books you will be allowed to look up in the middle and rightmost sections of the bookcase The book we are looking for however is the dark green one situated to the right of and leaning away from the cardboard box in the third from the top shelf of the rightmost section of the bookcase It is called quot Classes LINGUARUM quot Flip through the pages of this book until you find the quot Hungarian Runes quot Based on the information in this page the first line on the stone reads E or E N or N Similarly the second line should read asOINIAV However the rules on the second page not shown here tell us that the runes were usually written quot alternating direction left to right then right to left quot Hence since we had read the first line left to right we must now read the second line right to left Thus the second line actually reads asVAINIO
Open your inventory and click on the stone A white piece of paper appears to your left with two sets of three boxes each on the first line and a set of six boxes on the second line Note the cursor in the first box on the top line Use the keypad appearing on your right to click inE The cursor goes to the second set of three boxes still on the first line Click inN As the cursor moves down to the six boxes on the second line click inVAINIO Press quot ENTER quot The professor confirms that we have the right solution He also suggests looking up the map
Turn to your left now and approach the map on the wall Close up on it and your cursor itself becomes a large magnifying glass Move this glass around and note that the higher up you move over the map the directions showing vertically on your left change from South to North while moving further to the right changes the directions showing horizontally above the map from West to East Thus move the glass around until you seeN verticallyto the left of the map andE horizontallyabove the map Once you have these co ordinates click and you will zoom in further on the map Move the glass around again until you getN on your left andE at the top of the screen Click to zoom in even further Finally you are at a stage where you can zoom in on the actual co ordinates from the stone So move the glass now until you getN on your left andE above the map Click on these co ordinates and listen to the professor Then go back to Moresby's office and call Smythe Note It might be a good idea tosaveyour game just before you make the call because this is the last point when you can click on F in the dial in the upper right hand corner of the screen and still look up the documents collected in this episode
Listen to the conversation between the two men and we are off to Lapland
As the first episode concludes we are shown a map and a path is drawn across it marking the professor's travel Note the documents that accumulate around this map as the path is marked You will regain control of the game only after the path is completely drawn Read the documents You will find three letters from Smythe to the professor on the left side of the map a postcard from the professor to Smythe at the top right of the map and two letters from the professor to his wife on the right side of the map Finally there is a book the professor's biography written by his wife at the lower right hand side of the map But don't worry there are only two pages to read here Again note this would be a good place tosaveyour game as well because none of these writings are deposited in the professor's file when the following episode begins Thus if you save your game now you can easily come back to this save and reread anything here that you might wish to read again
Episode Lapland The train drops the professor at the station and moves off Step forward turn left and click on the door to knock Click again to enter quot Uhh What a stuffy smell of alcohol quot Turn left and step forward Close up on the map on the wall to your left and note the three villages indicated there Turn to your right then to find the station master in bed apparently out in a drunken stupor Step up to him listen to the professor's comment and then click on the man to try to wake him up quot Hopeless hellip quot If you stay in the station long enough you will hear the professor start to complain about the cold in the room He will also worry about the station master freezing to death before he wakes up So let's take care of that before doing anything else
Turn slightly to your left and go to the bookshelf on the wall to the left of the large mirror Feel free to click and leaf through the two books on the left but it is thefourthone from the right that is important Close up on that book click on it to straighten it and reveal a box of matches behind Pick up the match box and step out of the close up

As usual a blank piece of white paper will appear to your left and a key pad will appear to your right As you click in the letters on the white page using the key pad note click on the quot NEXT quot button at the lower left corner of the key pad to leave a blank space between words use the red button with the arrow in the lower middle to delete the previous letter s if you make a mistake finally do not worry about punctuation nor should you try to leave more than one blank space between words Thus click in the following message TO PROFESSOR SAMUEL HUNT FROM ENGLAND IS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE ON WEDNESDAY PLEASE PREPARE A SLEIGH FOR HIM PEKKA Check to make sure that you have made no typographical errors Otherwise you would not be allowed to proceed in the game After checking press quot ENTER quot and hear the professor read the message thus confirming the accuracy of your input Hence we learn that Smythe had done his best but in vain because there is still no sleigh around to deliver the professor to his next destination So now you need to take care of this problem yourself

Go back inside the station and approach the railway man again Note that he has turned over to his right side Close up on the red belt around his waist Pick up the small key sticking out of his back pocket Step out of the close up and approach the cabinet under the window to your left Close up on the cabinet doors once again and use the key on the right doorknob to open the cabinet Pick up the green medicine bottle sitting on two pieces of paper in the upper shelf Now click on those documents to find a two page letter from the railway man's son and a yellow colored piece of paper with a drawing on it Look closely at this drawing Note the two levers in the middle of the page each of them with a gear to its right The lever on the left has nine grooves in it and the gear next to it also has nine protruding points Note also that the gear clicks into the lever at thesecondnotch from the top Similarly the lever on the right has thirteen notches on it and the gear next to it also has thirteen protruding points This gear clicks into the lever at thefifthnotch We now have all the information we need about the shed door's lock system ndash thanks to Paavo the railway man's son
Step out of the close up and go to the door Instead of stepping out however turn around to see three plates on the wall in front of you Step forward look down and see the stool on the floor Click on the arrow pointing LEFT to move the stool under the leftmost plate on the wall You can close up on this plate now so do that Turn the plate all the way to the left and then all the way to the right You will find that it makes eight turns Thus it controls the smaller gear we saw in Paavo's drawing Turn the plate to the extreme left Since this starting position is in fact the first notch on the diagram turn the plate to theright once
Step out of the station Turn left and step forward Turn left again step forward and then close upon the rusty looking small plate on the wall to your left As you count you find that the valve in this plate makes twelve turns Hence it must be what controls the other gear depicted in Paavo's drawing
As you had done with the plate in the station turn the valve all the way to the left and know that this is the first notch from the drawing So turn the valve to theright four times Step out of the close up Go right and around the corner of the building to return to the shed door Close up on the hole to the left of the door and note the triangular opening within that hole now You must now find the key that fits this opening

The ride is cut short however as a wooden bridge collapses before us The professor steps out of the sleigh and must go on foot from here Step forward to cross the bridge and hear it collapse completely behind us There is only one direction we can take right now so turn left and step forward
As you move the cursor over a structure up on the hill slightly to your right the professor will remark quot Lo a polar lights observation post quot Before we get to that however let's turn around left and take that one step back to the collapsed bridge As you move your cursor you will see that you can now go intwodifferent directions The left one will take you back to that observation post Take a step to the right instead Turn left and take two steps Turn left again take one more step and then look to your left to find a giant bolder on the ground with two much smaller stones in front of it at its base Pick up the wheel lying between these two smaller stones

As the second episode concludes we are once again presented with a map and the professor's travel to his next destination Madagascar is marked across it As the marking is completed read the correspondence between Smythe and the professor There are two letters from Smythe to the professor at the left side of the map another letter from Smythe to the professor at the top of the map and then a letter from the professor to Smythe at the right side of the map Finally read the eight pages of the professor's biography written by his wife at the lower right portion of your screen
Note Again this might be a good spot tosaveyour game just in case you might want to come back and reread any of these documents or the biography
Episode Madagascar We find the professor at the beach As the cut scene ends you should be looking out to sea Turn a little to your right and take two steps forward moving away to the left from the boat to arrive at an apparent dead end by the rocks Turn right and go back along the beach to return to the boat Keep going forward to the right of the boat this time and go to the other end of the beach Pan the camera to your left and note the fishing net Now turn a little to the left step forward Turn right take another step and hear the professor's comment about the wall around the village Turn right and step forward to approach the guard at the village entrance The dialogue box will indicate many possible topics as the conversation develops Exhaust all of these topics Don't worry even when the guard threatens you with his spear Just keep on clicking on the speech icon on the guard covering the topics until that icon no longer appears on the guard Thus you find out about the villagers' distrust of pirates a little bit about the forest and about the fact that there is apparently one last and old pirate still to be found in the clearing beyond that forest
Follow the guard's suggestion to use berries to lure a lemur into leading the way through the forest So pick up a handful of red berries from the pan sticking out of the wall slightly to your left Turn slightly further to your left and note the narrow path leading into the forest Take two steps down this path and the camera will automatically pan down to your right to show you a lemur sitting on the ground Close up on the stone in front of him Place the red berries on the stone and a short cut scene will show the lemur taking them You will be automatically brought out of the close up Step forward into the forest You hear nothing and you will find arrows pointing in four different directions Step forward again quot Where are you my little helper hellip quot Almost as if on cue you will hear the lemur's cry You must now follow those cries to help you reach that clearing the guard had mentioned
Note Every time you take a step there will be arrows pointing in four directions The trick is to pan the camera around to a point where the lemur's cry sounds the loudest Click on the arrow in that spot to move forward Wait to hear the sound of the lemur again determine where that sound is the loudest and then click on the arrow appearing in that spot Some people might do the whole thing in eight clicks others will take ten But don't despair even if it takes you longer to get through Just keep following the lemur's cries in this way I also got the feeling that it is best to click in the middle of the lemur's cry itself So maybe this part of the game has as much to do with coordinating with thesoundas well as the spot where that sound is heard the loudest
When you take the last step a cut scene will show the professor stepping out of the forest The camera will pan down to the right automatically to show the lemur sitting in front of yet another stone We will need him again on our way back But for now hellip Step forward turn right and step forward to approach the fireplace on the ground Look down to your right and pick up the rags Turn back to the fireplace look up and taketwosteps forward Turn right step forward and pick up the firewood on the ground below Turn back around and step forward Turn right step forward turn right again step forward to arrive at yet another clearing Pick up the quot slats quot wooden planks from the pile behind the crate with some kind of a device sitting on the top Close up on this device then and find that it is some kind of a presser when you click on the handle in the back of the quot head quot the upper part of the quot mouth quot presses against the lower part Hmmm hellip Step out of the close up and note that you can go either left or right Take a step towards the right turn left and take another step forward Now pan the camera around to your left to find a large tree with some wooden planks attached to serve as steps This is the tree that the professor was talking about when we had initially arrived at the area with the fireplace Click on the UP arrow and the professor indicates that some of the steps are missing No problem Open your inventory click on the slats and then on the rags to make two temporary steps Pick up one of them and click on the top hole you see on the side of the tree ndash in the empty part under the steps already there your step will begin to glow when you hover it over the correct spot Now pick up the other temporary step and click on the tiny spotunderthe step you just attached note where the second step glows to attach this one to the tree as well The professor will indicate that the row of steps is still incomplete but that he can manage
Go up a step to find that you cannot go further Note the large wooden board below practically at your feet serving as a kind of landing Turn around look down and pick up one of the temporary steps you had just attached to the tree With this step still in hand appearing as your cursor turn back around and look downunder the landingfor a spot where the temporary step will glow again Click and that step will now be attached in front of you Go up and a cut scene will show the professor going up the rest of the way and arriving at the entrance to the tree house Turn to your right and step through the reddish curtain
Turn left and look down at the middle shelf Note the brown bowl of rice on the left side of that shelf But you don't have anything you can use to take some rice out nor does there appear to be any reason just yet to do so So look back in front of you step forward and close up on the table down to your right Pick up the matchbox sitting behind the hand sander Then pick up theENINAcard to its left
Step out of the close ups turn right and step forward Turn right and close up on the wall painting Make a note of the letters etched at the side of the sail ship ABE Step out of the close up and turn around to the left of the ladder Pick up the quot missing step quot leaning against the wall in front of you Then pick up theEFATRAcard from the bucket to the left of where the step had been sitting You might have to pan the camera slightly to the right to pick up theIRAYcard from the floor immediately to the left of the doorway Turn right and go up the ladder to arrive at the second level Turn right and step through the curtain of vines The old pirate lies on a bed in front of you
Turn right and pick up theROAcard from behind the bag of mushrooms on the top shelf Now step towards the old man and the camera will automatically pan down on him Bring out the wine from your inventory and give it to the old man A cut scene follows You must now find some food for the old man Look to your left and pick up theDIMYcard from the right of the wash basin on the table next to the bed Turn around further to your left and close up on the corner shelf Pick up the lantern from the top shelf to theleftof the pole holding up the shelf Pick up the quot bowl quot it is actually a deep frying pan from the top shelf to therightof the same pole and a handful of brown berries from the shelf below Step out of the close up Go back down to the first level Go over to the entrance but before you leave turn right and use your recently acquired quot bowl quot to take out some rice from the middle shelf
Step out of the hut and take two steps down to find that you can go no further There is a gear icon right at your feet Bring out the step you had found in the hut and click where you had seen the gear icon the step will glow when you hover it over that spot Now step down and forward to reach the fireplace clearing Turn left to look at the fireplace Bring out the bowl of rice and click on the pot over the fireplace to pour the rice into that pot Look up step forward and turn around to your right to see a barrel full of water Fill your bowl with some of that water and return to the fireplace Put the water in the pot over the fireplace only to find that it is not enough So go back to the barrel of water and fill your bowl with some more water Return to the fireplace and pour that water into the pot Bring out the firewood from your inventory and place it under the pot Finally click on the matchbox and then on the firewood below to light a fire under the pot
Hanging around and waiting will not do any good You are supposed to do something else before the rice is cooked So look up and take two steps forward Turn left then step forward turn right and step forward to reach the second clearing Close up on the device on the crate place the brown berries in the quot mouth quot and press the handle at the back of the quot head quot The brown berries will turn into red berries Pick up those red berries and step out of the close up Note once again that you can go either left or right Turn left this time step forward turn slightly to the left again and take another step forward then turn right and taketwosteps forward to return to the fireplace The rice is cooked now Fill your quot bowl quot with some of that quot steamed rice quot Turn left and step forward to reach the big tree Go up to the second level and give this bowl of rice to the old man
Click on the speech icon now appearing on the man When he asks quot who are you quot you can actually pick either of the answers given because you will get the same information in response I prefer the second choice though quot Adventurer in search of the Agon quot because the old man seemed to become a little hostile when I had tried the first choice in playing this portion of the game earlier
The dialogue moves forward and the old man is reluctant to go in details for fear that it is a long story Click on quot Please tell me hellip quot to encourage him to continue A cut scene follows in which you learn all about the old man ndash Jonathan Morgan and the late Captain Jeremiah Dodd As the cut scene ends click on Morgan to gain more information You will have to do this several times but be sure to keep clicking and asking all the questions that appear in the dialogue box until the professor indicates that we should not disturb the man any further Now turn right and step towards the ladder by the window Turn around to face the ladder and click to go up Turn around then to face another ladder Go up that ladder as well to reach the third level and inside the Captain's quot quarters quot There is a large window like opening on your left Click on the cards hanging on the wall to the left of that window and thus pick up theVALO FOLO FITO andSIVYcards one by one Turn around to your right and look down on the ground under the hammock Feel free to leaf through the book in the front but it is the one in the back almost hidden in the right corner under the hammock which we really need It is called quot Vocabulary of the Malgasy The language of Madagascar quot and is stated to be quot The Most Detailed English Malgasy Dictionary quot quot Well well hellip quot And there is good reason for this comment by the professor As you leaf through the pages note that the words on the cards we had picked Dimy Enina etc
represent numbers Feel free to make a note of the Malgasian equivalent of thetennumbers you find in this dictionary or wait for my diagram that shortly follows
Turn left to face the central part of the quarters now Look down on the floor Again feel free to pick up and leaf through the two books in the box to your right Next pick up theTELOcard lying on the ground to the left of the box full of books You will see it sticking out from just above the book you find leaning against a pile of other books on the floor Thus you should now have a total of ten cards Note you can click on the quot F quot on the dial in the upper right corner of your screen thus opening up the Table of Contents where you can click on any one of the ten cards you collected in this tree house Thus you can refer to these cards at any time that you wish
Now pick up that dark book leaning against the pile of other books quot Falconer's Marine Dictionary quot Note the three questions on the left page as you open the book Where
What
When The professor is right that these are supposed to serve as some kind of reminders for us as well In fact the next time you open the book a key pad will appear to your right and you will actually have to answer these questions But we don't have enough information to do that just yet So just flip through the pages and as you begin the actual dictionary portion of the book note the letters ABE at the top of the second column on the left page Recall that these are the same letters that we had seen on the side of the ship in the wall painting at the first level The text following the letters in the book although hard to read is actually irrelevant to our quest The letters are all that matter But again we don't have enough information yet to figure out what they mean So let's move on for now hellip Close up on the telescopic apparatus in front of the window to your left Close up first on the settings to the left of the telescope Note the three levers The one on the left can be set at Roman Numerals I II or III The one in the center moveshorizontally from left to right and can be set at or Finally the one on the extreme right movesvertically from bottom to top and can be set at or as well Feel free to try different settings Every time you change the setting for any lever step out of the close up on the settings and into the one on the telescope to check the result You will find that some settings will show writings on objects indicating different times at dusk at midnight etc
and places behind the village on the forest path etc
while others indicate nothing at all Again we don't have enough information yet to find the answers that we need So let's move on again for now hellip It is time to visit the Captain's grave So step out of the tree house and take a step towards the fireplace Take another step forward on the path to the right of the fireplace to return to the edge of the forest The camera will automatically pan around to focus on the lemur sitting on the ground below Close up on the stone in front of him place the red berries and watch the lemur take them You will be brought out of the close up automatically Taketwosteps into the forest and you will hear the lemur's cry So as before just click on the arrow in the spot where the lemur's cry appears to be the loudest to return to the village
As you thus step out of the forest taketwosteps forward away from the forest to approach the guard There is no need to talk to him however Just pick up another handful of berries from the pan to his left turn slightly further to the left and take two steps down that narrow path back to the edge of the forest Close up on the lemur sitting on the ground to your right place the red berries on the stone and watch him take off As you are brought out of the close up automatically step forward to enter the forest yet again But this time we are not going to the clearing on the other side but to the Captain's grave in the forest itself So you can ignore the lemur's cry altogether Just keep clicking on the arrow right in front of you to keep going forward Not counting that step you took to enter the forest after the lemur took off you should find yourself facing the grave at thefifthclick
Note Please SAVE your game at this point and read the following instructions carefully to avoid possible frustration in attempting this puzzle
There are nine poles on the left side of the grave Note the colored shapes on the poles under the ox figurines and you will find that each of these patterns on the different poles is comparable to a pattern also under an ox figurine in one of the cards you collected in the tree house The English Malgasy Dictionary had helped us determine the correct order of those cards Thus we can see that the poles here are quot out of order quot We need to rearrange them now in the correct order left to right going from the foot to the head of the grave
But we had collected ten cards and there are only nine poles by the grave Hence one of the cards should be redundant In my case it was number ten Folo However I played this game twice and found the poles set up in a different order around the grave each time So I have included the tenth card in the picture that shortly follows just in case that pattern happens to pop up in your particular game It is also for this reason that I cannot give you an exact solution to this puzzle But I hope the following suggestions will be helpful
Take one step to the left of the grave and turn left to face the three poles presented to you Note that you can pick up any one of these three poles butDON'Tdo that just yet Rather refer to the cards in your File or to my diagram below and make a note of each of the three poles in the order that they appear left to right For example Is it or etc
Take another step to your right and turn to face the second group of three poles Again determine and make a note of the order in which these three poles appear left to right
Finally take another step to your right and turn around to face the last group of three poles Determine and make a note of the order of these poles as well
This will be a good point tosaveyour game now that the computer has already established the order of the nine poles and before you move any one of them
Once you have noted the order of all nine poles you must now rearrange them in thecorrectorder In this connection please keep two things in mind
a You doNOThave to put a pole into your inventory and then bring it out again to put it in a different position It would be much easier just tocarrythe pole So when you pick a pole out of its original position move it to the left or right depending on where you want to go of the group of three poles in front of you and click where the pole in your hand glows You will be moved to that position with the pole still in your hands appearing as your cursor b Don't forget that when you pick up a pole you will then be able to see only poles on the ground This is probably the trickiest part of the puzzle ndash keeping track of the order of the remaining poles after you have picked up one of them Taking notes to indicatewhatyou have movedwherewill be really helpful for this purpose
The cards numbered are as follows Once again remember that you have to rearrange the poles so that they will appear in the correct order left to right i e starting from the pole at the foot of the grave to the one at the head of the grave The correct ordermost likelywill be but try if the pattern from thetenthcard happens to pop up As soon as you place the last pole in its correct order the professor will confirm quot Yes no doubt this must have been the original order quot Let rsquo s find out now what we accomplished by arranging the poles in the correct order
Go to the last pole at the head of the grave Look down to your right and close upbehindthe headstone Etched in the stone you will see twenty six letters of the English alphabet and a foreign symbol above each of these letters Thus each foreign symbol is supposed to represent the letter of the English alphabet appearing under it Go back to the poles now to your right and note that one or more of these same symbols have been carved on the wooden portion of each pole under the colored pattern we had been examining up until now So now that the poles are in their correct order the symbols are in the correct order as well and all you have to do is to make a note of the symbols on the poles and then refer to the back of the headstone to see what English letters they represent to decipher the message on the headstone
When you are ready click on the back of the headstone and a piece of white paper will appear to your left and a key pad to your right Click in the following message using theNEXTbutton at the lower left corner of the key pad to leave a blank space between words UNDER THOSE DATES WK PressENTERon the key pad The professor will confirm the solution and indicate that we must now figure out what the reference to those quot dates quot means
Go back to the foot of the grave and step towards therightside of the grave this time Close up on thefrontof the headstone Open your inventory click on the knife and then click on the dates written on the headstone Thus that part of the headstone is removed revealing a compartment inside Click on the piece of paper to the right to retrieve the third page of the mysterious codex Now click on the notebook to the left and flip through the pages Note the diagram at the very end of the notebook
We must now return to the Captain's quarters back in the tree house So step to the foot of the grave and then into the forest Step forward again and you will hear the lemur's cry Once again follow his sound to return to the clearing by the fireplace Step forward and then to your left to approach the tree Go all the way up to the Captain's quarters Close up on the telescopic apparatus and then on the settings Now click on the F on the dial in the upper right corner of your screen to bring up the Table of Contents Click on quot Captain Notebook quot Go to the end of the notebook and look at the following diagram again
Recall the letters we had seen on the wall painting on the first level of the tree house ABE This is the code to the settings as well as the clue to the answers to the questions in that book on the floor Here is how to decode both Note that the diagram is actually divided up into three separate sections each consisting of nine boxes each Find the letter quot A quot in the left section underRoman Number I Note further that the numbers written vertically to the left of the diagram represent the settings of the lever that moves vertically i e the lever on the right side of the settings There are no numbers written horizontally under the diagram You mustassumethat they are and that they represent the settings of the lever that moves horizontally i e
the middle lever in the settings Thus we see that the quot A quot in the left section of the diagram requires us to set theleft most lever to I the middle lever to and the right most lever to as well Click the X Exit to step out of the close up on the notebook and set the levers to these positions Then step out of the close up on the settings and into the one on the telescope to find the words quot on the Beach quot written on a board on a tree branch
Next we look at the quot B quot in the middle section of the diagram underRoman Number II to find that it requires a horizontal setting of and a vertical setting of So set theleft most lever to II the middle lever to and the right most lever to Now close up on the telescope to see the words quot the skull rock quot written on an object Finally look at the quot E quot in the right most section of the diagram underRoman Number III and find that it requires a horizontal setting of and a vertical setting of also So setthe left most lever at III the middle lever to and the right most lever to as well Close up on the telescope again to see the words quot at ebb of tide quot written on a broken wooden crate
We are now ready to answer the three questions in that book So step out of these close ups and look down at that book quot Falconer's Marine Dictionary quot leaning against the pile of other books on the ground Close up on that book and as indicated earlier a key pad appears to the right while the cursor appears after the first question quot Where quot Click in the words quot on the beach quot using theNEXTbutton at the lower left corner of the keypad to leave a blank space between words PressENTERon the keypadto go to the next question quot What quot Click in the words quot the skull rock quot and then pressENTERon the keypad againto go to the last question quot When quot Click in the words quot at ebb of tide quot and pressENTERon the keypadto finish The professor will confirm the correctness of the solution
Step out of the close up and go down to the second level of the tree house As you step forward be sure to grab a handful of brown berries from that corner shelf to your left You can leave the tree house now As you get off the last step pan the camera to your right just to the left of the tree steps and step forward Pan the camera to your right again and step forward Now pan the camera to your left and down to find that presser Close up on the presser put the brown berries in its quot mouth quot and then press the handle at the back of its quot head quot to turn the brown berries into red berries Pick up the red berries and step out of the close up Again note that as you turn around you can go either left or right Step forward to your right Turn left and step forward to return next to the tree Step forward to find the path towards the forest either to your right or in front of you Step forward on this path and then pan the camera down to your left to find the lemur sitting on the ground Close up on the stone in front of him put the red berries on the stone and then wait to be automatically brought out of the close up Now turn slightly to your right and step forward to enter the forest
You will be happy to know that you don't have to follow the lemur's cries all the way back this time because as soon as you take that one step into the forest after the lemur a cut scene will show the professor back at the beach It will be dusk already
Wait for the professor to finish his comment and then step forward to your left The camera will pan to the right automatically and the professor will exclaim about seeing Skull Rock clearly from that position Look down and pick up one of the green strands from the ground quot A strong water plant and very flexible too quot Pick up another strand You must now go along the beach to the rocks on the other side So turn slightly right and step forward Turn slightly left then and step forward again Turn slightly to the left yet again and step forward to finally reach the rocks Now turn left and step forward in the direction of the sea Step forward in the same direction reaching the sea Turn right now and step forward to the left of the huge rocks Turn slightly to the right and step forward in the direction where you see some bright orange bamboos lying up ahead At this point you can either go forward or to your right towards the bamboos But you cannot pick up any of those bamboos just yet so step forward instead to arrive at the mouth of a cave As you approach it the camera will pan slightly to focus the view directly over this cave as the professor makes a comment about the cave
Step into the cave and a cut scene will follow Step forward turn slightly to your left and click on either one of the bamboos in the water The camera will automatically pan down to your left to show the two bamboos now arranged horizontally on the ground The gear icon on the bamboos indicates the need for further action Step back out of the cave turn left and step up in the direction of those bamboos you had seen just before entering the cave Pick up all eight of them five from the front and three at your back and return to the cave where the first two bamboos had been laid out for you Open your inventory click on a bamboo and then on the spot between the two already on the ground Thus put all the bamboos on the ground to see them arranged in the form of a raft Now click on the two strands of seaweed in your inventory one by one and then on the quot raft quot to tie those bamboos together at the top and bottom ends of the raft Click on the completed raft and a cut scene will follow
As the cut scene ends step forward and hear the professor complain about the darkness So open the inventory click on the matchbox and then on the lantern to light up the place As in the beginning of the game the lantern will stay in the inventory but you will now have some light
Turn back around and step forward to see the raft in the distance Click on the forward arrow to hear the professor explain that the raft has drifted away so you will have to find another way of getting out after you are done in this place of course
Turn around and take six steps forward until you hear the professor's comment about the fact that this is the place where only the Captain had set his foot Pan the camera down to your left to see the chest on the ground If you click on the gear icon at this time you will see a cut scene showing that the chest is too heavy for the professor to move it just yet So close up on the chest instead and find that it is full of rocks Click on the rocks one by one to remove them You will find a white box at the lower left corner of the chest As you click on this box you find that it is a board game Click on the X Exit to step out of this close up Be sure to remove any remaining rocks from the chest and then step out of the second close up in the chest itself Now click on the gear icon appearing on the chest to see a cut scene showing the professor moving the chest aside and discovering quot another tunnel quot behind it
Before we go into this tunnel however turn right and take two steps forward The professor indicates that we cannot go any further this way Close up on the rocks in front of you There is a pickaxe head caught between the rocks Try to pick it up and the professor indicates that you cannot free it by hands alone Step out of the close up turn around and take the two steps to come back to the chest Step into the tunnel to the right of the chest and another cut scene follows Apparently the professor has tripped or fallen but don't worry You can still come back to the chest You would just have to go UP to do so
For now though takeeightsteps forward adjusting your view as you go along to keep moving in that direction You will find yourself at the end of the tunnel with a ladder lying against the wall to your right Step towards the ladder and pick it up Now turn left and step towards the pool of water There is a rope dangling down from above with a bucket tied to the bottom end of the rope Look up and move your cursor around on the well's wall to the left of the rope You will see a gear icon where the well's natural wall ends and a man made brick wall rises above it Bring out the ladder from your inventory and click where it glows to place it against the natural edge of the well's wall Step up on the ladder Click on the arrow pointing up to hear the professor's comment that you cannot go any further and that even though some of the bricks can be moved quot hands are not enough for such an operation quot Look down to the right of the ladder and pick up the pole standing in the shadows against the well's wall some feet away from the ladder It turns out to be a pickaxe shaft Step down the ladder and go all the way to the other end of this tunnel Pan your cameraUP to find a hole in what appears to be the ceiling This is the spot through which the professor had apparently fallen Click on the arrow appearing in this spot to climb back up next to the chest Move your cursor around to find the chest and then take two steps into that very short dead ended tunnel to therightof that chest Close up on the rocks we had seen earlier Now open your inventory click on the pickaxe shaft and then on the pickaxe head stuck among the rocks to use the shaft to pry out and pick up the pickaxe head The shaft is still in your hands So just click on the pickaxe head now in your inventory to attach the shaft to the head thus getting a whole pickaxe
Go back to the chest and into the tunnel behind it Go all the way to the other end and step up on the ladder Close up on the brick wall in front of you Bring out the pickaxe from your inventory and click on the brick at thelower rightcorner of the screen Thus that brick is removed leaving behind an empty slot You can now use that slot to move around the bricks so that some of them would serve as steps to help the professor climb out of this well
Here is the order in which you should place the bricks The two quot columns quot in the center of the wall is where the bricks will serve as steps The two slots on either side of those columns are for quot spares quot Note that you need to place a total of eight bricks four in each of these two central columns Note also the number of dashes after the quot X quot on each brick The two bricks with only one dash each are too short to serve as steps and need to bediscardedin the spare slots The rest of the bricks need to be arranged in the order shown below Note the number after the dash in the following picture represents the number of dashes on the right edge of the bricks in the game itself Thus for example quot X ndash quot refers toanybrick with four dashes on its right edge
As you place the last brick in the correct order the professor will confirm the solution and a cut scene will follow immediately The professor climbs out of the well only to be struck by the guard from behind He wakes up in the Chief's hut and must now explain why he was found entering the village in such a suspicious manner At the end of the cut scene click on the Chief to start a dialogue You are given a choice of three statements Use all three by picking the choice at the top every time At the end of the third statement a gear icon will appear on the Chief Bring out the board game from your inventory and give it to the Chief Another dialogue follows Again click the choice at the top first and then the second one that follows The Chief is convinced of the professor's good intentions and asks him what he would like in exchange for the favor he has done the Chief You get only one choice ask him to help old Morgan The professor then asks that they start playing the board game immediately So you are presented with the rules for the board game Be sure to read all four pages of these rules We are now ready to play our second and last board game of this AGON installment
FANORONA Following is my solution to this board game Again it is for playing the game in theNORMALmode Feel free to change the difficulty level to EASY to no doubt come up with a much simpler solution
Please note that this time I have not indicated the results of your moves nor the enemy moves and their results Given the nature of this particular game it would have made things only more complicated rather than simpler if I had done so There are more columns and fewer rows in this solution than there had been for the first one because of the difference in the two boards of course Otherwise the format of the solution is the same Thus the first move C C means that you must move your piece from cell C to cell C Note also that this is the only move I have recommended that will require you tochoosewhich enemy piece should be removed from the board As I have indicated parenthetically pick the piece on cell C So with all this in mind now let's playFANORONA

There are side arrows that cycle the designs
Dial The tubes can be rotated using the dial on the front of the kaleidoscope
The dial's code as to where it points is based on the circle with lines below it
The lines are in wedges like spider web
One line means the first in the sequence lines wedge is the second in the sequence and so on
Turn the dial to point where the selected wedge is positioned in the circle
Kaleidoscope puzzle The aim of the puzzle is to select a specific design for each of the tubes and the tubes are to be done in numbered order
The designs to be selected are taken from all the pictures of tiles with numbers and design seen throughout the game
The sequence of the design to be entered in the kaleidoscope is based on the clue left by WK on the wall of the secret cellar in the sewer
After roaming throughout note that there are some similar numbers in the pictures but have different tile design
By trial and error deduce which one to use
Deduction of the numbers on the wall The number seen on the wall at the secret cellar is
Numbered pictures seen in town Painter's room Plaza Police station Candelas and Darkroom Secret cellar
Possible numbers to use
Take note that there are numbered and
Starting at the end of there are no or or
So the two numbers at the end are and

To deduce the rest the possibilities are or or or
Since we need more numbers because there are tubes we can eliminate
We are left with or or
Since the possibility of or are not possible
Then the middle number is
We are left with
To have numbers the third number will have to be
We need numbers now
By process of elimination find out that only pictured pattern matches one of the patterns in tube of the kaleidoscope
The deduced sequence of numbers is
The duplicate numbered patterns are also eliminated by checking on that appropriate tube
Design and sequence of tiles Check these designs to recall what pattern to select in the kaleidoscope

For line wedge turn the dial counter clockwise to NE position similar to the location of the line on the wedge spiderweb below it
Look through the lens and cycle using the side arrows to select the correct design from picture
Leave the selected design and pull back
Turn the dial counterclockwise with wide tip to point to lines' position as seen at bottom circle at the front of the kaleidoscope
For lines wedge turn the dial counter clockwise to top right position similar to the location of the lines on the wedge spiderweb below it
Look through the lens and cycle using the side arrows to select the correct design from picture

That's down and around the side toward the Topaz Gate
Approach the pool and get the action cursor
Press lt space gt and in you go
Use the arrow keys to turn slightly right and the up arrow to swim forward to the hatch on the bottom
Open it take the box out and open it to find a list of instructions for Jack
Poor fellow
No wonder he seems stressed out
Exit that scene and the next chapter begins
Chapter Five Alicia's Room As you leave the pool area you will automatically pop in on Alicia
When you get the action cursor select the Birds Machine from inventory
It has several controls The four white buttons across the top select what kind of sound is produced thus whom it affects
The two silver buttons in the middle are not adjustable
The wheel changes the level of intensity from one top to five bottom
Talking with Alicia you need the third white button the one that sounds like a music box
First use level one then level two
Then she plugs it in so that the sounds reach her uncle Robert
Use the first white button the screeching sound
First level one then level two until he can't stand it
You automatically exit her room and he calls you to his
You have to investigate Jack
Where could he be
Graveyard perhaps
Before you go there check out three more rooms at the Motel
More Motel Rooms Find theCinematographer's room
It's just behind the plants where you found the red sock and the key
Find the hatbox in the closet and red the letter inside
It seems Constance wasn't completely innocent either

You can play any of your videotapes on the TV
At the bookshelf find the Incredible Truth about Grace Kelly and observe the image of the compass on the DVD cover of North by Northwest As you do you hear a slight 'clink' sound and the compass no longer adjusts
When you back out there is a file visible at the right side of the shelving that was not previously there
It seems she was planning to publish an expos of MJI's activities
On the bottom shelf set the compass to NNW thus As you do you hear a slight 'clink' sound and the compass no longer adjusts
When you back out there is a file visible at the right side of the shelving that was not previously there
It seems she was planning to publish an expos of MJI's activities
The Church Graveyard You encounter Jack who has a gun so he's in charge of things for a while
He wants you to place the tombstones on the correct graves
Ow
Hasn't anyone ever told Joseph how to lift heavy objects without straining his back
It hurts just to watch him
Maybe the sequel will feature a Chiropractor
The first stone you pick up is Michael Armstrong Actor
You will find his grave the third one from the back
There are eight open graves in all the one closest to you ishidden by the stone wall
Here are the coffin names in order from back to front The order you find them in the shed is Armstrong Ferguson Elster Toothbridge Gromek Basten Tyler Samuels
So o o confused yet
What's worse only the first few names are readable as you pick up the stones
The rest you must guess at
Use the stones on the graves in this order numbering from one far back to eight close up

When Jack who is not too swift turns around just press space to depart the graveyard and you will end up in the house
Robert's Room Secret Room Go upstairs and talk with Robert
Talk to him about all the murders
You will find yourselves in the secret room
The conversation continues until Robert threatens to shoot
Press space and Robert is shot dead
His gun was loaded with blanks
Examine the body and find the Card
You find yourself back in his room
Look through the books aver the bed
It seems he has more than a passing interest in Joseph Shamley
Has he been setting Joseph up all along
Look especially at the book on the other side of the bed the one that refers to the solstice the shortest day of the year
Look at the desk in the opposite corner
Over the desk is a map of Bellagio Bay
Almost looks like Myst Island doesn't it
Look closely at the desk
You must adjust the earth the date and position the boat
The earth goes to the far left the date is and the boat goes to Ithaca
The desk is unlocked
Look in the drawers and take the Frenzy Card the Frenzy card and the Safe Card
Robert's Office Go down the stairs and into the office
Open the safe by selecting the Safe Card
The three drawers inside are all accessible
Read all documents and take the slide viewer and theGreen Slide
You should already have the Red and Blue slides
When you exit the safe Alicia comes in and has an automatic conversation with you
At the end of the conversation select the slide viewer
Put all three slides in the viewer to reveal a secret door in the bookshelves
Go down to the viewing room and sit in the red chair
Turn on the power then select the center screen
Oops
Now we know what that funny screen test was all about
The editors joined our image with another to make it look like Joseph killed Constance
Alicia needs to be convinced of Joseph's innocence
Keep playing film clips until you have the close up mode
Look at Constance to see that she has three hands
Thus the real killer is revealed
Don't forget to back out of the close up mode while the dialogue continues
Jack comes in
Complete the conversation with him sit back and enjoy the closing scenes

The characters excluding the dutchess each say one half of the proverb correctly or incorrectly
It is your job to match the proper proverbs to pass this puzzle
Due to the game not having any subtitles for the hearing impaired I will list out all of the characters' sayings If you are hearing impaired just click on the character I put a beside first then the character with a don't click on the characters without numbers
After the dutchess will say something
Then you can move on to the next proverb
There are proverbs in all
Only proverbs are needed to pass this puzzle

We have the option to make the blue beetle soup or merry marigold soup
The ingredients for nails and netle soup snail clove chicken egg and a nettle leaf are nowhere to be found in the game

Later in the game we will work our way through a snail maze
Even later in the game a chicken egg will be shown in a puzzle but neither it nor a snail can be collected and placed into our pantries inventories Note Soup puzzle layout
There are green machines in the puzzle
The green machine on the left side of the screen performs two functions
At the top of the machine left side of the screen is a lever
In the default down position it will cut an ingredient
In the up position it will beat an ingredient
On the right hand side of the screen there are green machines
The smaller one although it looks like a meat grinder is the chopper
The larger one closest to the wall on the right is the grinder
Basically we need to take ingredients from out pantry inventory place them onto the shelf at the top right hand side of the screen then deliver the ingredient to the appropriate place with the pincer at the top
If an ingredient needs to be ground or chopped it will have to be taken from a moving bowl by the second lower pincer
Once the ingredients are prepared we can send them to the cooking pot and make the appropriate soup Note Each recipe calls for one ingredient to be chopped one ingredient to be ground one ingredient for be beaten and one to be cut
Order doesn't matter but for this walkthrough I will describe from top to bottom in the recipe book chop grind beat then cut
Finally it doesn't matter which recipe you choose to prepare
I will discuss why after the puzzle solution

Also soldiers are needed to complete the bridge for Alice to cross
When playing this game don't get soldiers of the same color side by side or they both will leave
This game takes a little patience and there isn't really a strategy to follow
Just stick to it and you should get by just fine

THE END
WALKTHROUGH AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALIDA By The Fellowship of the Quest Step by step instructions for installing Alida on Win XP or Win are at the end of this walkthrough Note these installation instructions are applicable to the North American version of Alida The European version contains its own installation program
Alida Begins You will find yourself on an orange stone balcony as the game opens Alida is point and click and non linear You use the mouse to advance and when the cursor changes to an arrow you can turn Once you have already been to a location in the game you will often see the cursor turn into a rocket icon This means that you can ldquo rocket rdquo to the next location without having to take each step to get there Check to see if this feature is enabled by putting the cursor up at the top of the screen and clicking on ldquo Transitions rdquo and making sure that the ldquo Rocket Mode rdquo is checked
You can miss things by using the transitions this way so be sure you have thoroughly searched an area before using it If you don rsquo t want to use Rocket Mode just move the cursor a little and it will change to an arrow again
There is a lot to explore in Alida before you have to solve any puzzles First I suggest exploring on your own to get yourself oriented then return to this place on the balcony
Okay back on the orange stone balcony looking out to sea
The Orange Stone Chamber and the Puzzle Cabinets Turn right step forward and turn right again to go down an arched hallway of orange stone You will enter a large orange stone chamber with giant fingers coming out of the wall There rsquo s a giant plectrum used to strum a guitar at the far end of the chamber You rsquo ll also find three puzzle stations or puzzle cabinets each in its own arched alcove Behind the cabinets are transportation devices called T runners crafted by the multi talented Juno
Turn left into the first arched alcove You rsquo ll see the moon chimes puzzle also called the moon tone puzzle which was created by Arin the guy you rsquo ve come to locate The cabinet has green gray tubular chimes in it Go back behind the cabinet and there is a number Now go back to the front of the cabinet where you are facing the round brown keys Assume that the keys are numbered through starting left to right Input the number into the keys Black chimes descend Note that each of the original green gray chimes has a symbol on it each enclosed in a triangle These symbols in order from left to right are Line top to bottom Line side to side Inverted ldquo V rdquo Left angled line Empty circle Right angled line Triangle Solid circle Arin not only has created a puzzle cabinet he also was in charge of creating an area on Alida called the Switch Plus he has his own vault and his own cabin of which more later
Leave the moon chimes cabinet go out into the orange stone central chamber and walk further to the left past a black rectangular hall entrance until you come to the middle arched alcove Here you rsquo ll see another puzzle cabinet this one with numbers that can be set by dragging the mouse over the face of each number wheel There is also a button to push ndash try pushing it down for a few seconds and watch the change that occurs This is Luke rsquo s cabinet Luke also has his own vault and his own cabin and created an area on Alida called the Peghead
Leave the numbers cabinet go out into the central chamber turn left go past another dark rectangular hall entrance and find the final puzzle cabinet this one with three buttons and an imager Try pushing the buttons until you can advance each astronomical image While the image is playing put the mouse over the image you don rsquo t have to click just move the mouse over it ndash you will see flashes You can count the flashes which are either long or short and occur in a different pattern with each image To accurately count the flashes watch the light against the wood of the cabinet ndash this is less confusing that counting flashes by watching the image itself
This fun device is Juno rsquo s cabinet Juno has his own vault and his own cabin and he has created an area on Alida called the Potentiometers
A note from mjartisian I rsquo m going back and forth between several puzzles now I like the fact that most of them can be done in any order IfI get stuck on one puzzle I can just work on another amp come back to the first
The Orange Stone Chamber and the Black Rectangular Hallways Go back into the orange stone central chamber you rsquo ll see the giant plectrum as you do so turn right and walk down the black rectangular hall nearest the giant plectrum At the end of this hall turn to the left and see a closed metal door Then turn to the right to see an extension of the hallway Proceed further down the hallway and around the corner
You will be in a long triangular hallway that leads out onto a bridge This is a good place to admire the view At the end of the bridge is an odd door blocked by a weight with a peephole you can look in Turn back and go back over the bridge and down all the hallways until you are back into the orange stone chamber Walk straight forward into the room as far as you can then turn until you can see the giant fingers Look for a column with a square box on it ndash the column is on your right near the edge of the screen Click on the box to get closer to the column then click on the switch inside to trigger it You will hear a grinding and clanking noise Well you rsquo ve accomplished something Go back down the black rectangular hallway that you have just come out of it will be slightly to your right Something has changed There is now a closed metal door on the right blocking your path to the bridge but the metal door on the left is open The switch you just triggered closed one metal door and opened the other
Proceed through the open door and down the hallway You will come out onto a sort of dead end extension Look to your right to see the bridge you came down the first time
Continue onto the extension until you are in the little turret room
Look all around You will see some strange controls ndash balls with lines on them Move these a bit just to see how they work You will also see a viewer which shows you the view of another room with three interior metal lattices Your job in this area is to manipulate the strange controls until you move the lattices into alignment
The clue as to how to do this is elsewhere
While you are here though look at the view behind the controls You are seeing the guitar rsquo s Peghead and underneath it a black sphere That black sphere houses the room with the interior lattices that you just saw through the viewer
Go back into the orange stone central chamber You now need to go down the OTHER black rectangular hallway ndash the one between the numbers cabinet and the moon chime cabinet it is directly in front of the giant fingers You will come to a closed metal door Now you need to find the switch for this black rectangular hallway
Turn around and proceed straight into the orange stone chamber as far as you can go The wall curves a bit as you start out so finding the correct directional arrow is a bit tricky
You will be directly in front of the giant fingers Turn to your left and go one click step Turn to your right and step forward Turn to your right again and you will see another column with a switch box on it Click on the box then click on the lever More grinding and clanking Go back down the rectangular black hallway you just came out of slightly to your left to find ndash the metal door is now open
You have entered the main vault area There is plenty of interesting stuff to see inside the vault but you can rsquo t access it yet more about this later Go past the vault until you reach the elevator Go up the elevator button on the right until you arrive on the roof Step forward until you see a control panel for playing the strings of the guitar In the distance is a tower which you will later learn is the jack tower Turn the lever on the control panel and watch what happens
A note from LadyKestrel I rsquo ll bet on a clear day they could hear that on the mainland
A note from Becky That rsquo s why they had to have the giant guitar on an isolated island so the neighbors wouldn rsquo t complain
After the motorized plectrum plays the guitar someone will appear briefly in the circular view screen This person is now alerted to the fact that you are on Alida
Go back down the elevator back through the vault area and into the orange stone central chamber You have accomplished everything that you can here for the moment Leave the orange stone chamber go down the arched hall until you are once again on the balcony looking out at sea
The Ladder to the Place that is Purple Okay starting at the orange stone balcony looking out to sea Turn right Proceed into a black rectangular stone hallway Turn at the corner and proceed into it further Keep going straight until you hit a wall Turn left You will see a long hallway with an opening to the sea at the end Go down this hallway straight until you reach a darkened area with what looks like a rounded red chair Keep going until you seem to walk right through the chair Turn back around ndash on the left on a bit of railing you will see a white button Go back and click on this button you will have to turn and the cursor will signal ldquo down rdquo before you can properly click on it This will turn on a white light
Go back past the chair again in the direction of the sea Once you have stepped just past the chair on the railing on the left you will see a blue purple button This turns on a purple light which will be important in a minute But first turn around to see the back of the red chair Click the cursor signaling ldquo down rdquo and you will see three dials that can be moved Move them a bit if you want to see how they work
Now go back to the white button and turn the white light off Walk through the chair in the direction of the sea and click on the blue purple button to turn a purple light on Look back at the back of the red chair and at the device with dials The device with three dials on it now has arrows on it too You want to drag the mouse around each of the dials until the arrows on the dial are approximately pointing toward the arrows across from them on the device A light comes on and a ladder moves into position Go up the ladder you have to approach it from the other side There rsquo s a second ladder to climb You have now reached Arin rsquo s vault A surprise awaits you there Explore the vault area until you have seen the surprise
Exploring the Neck and Peghead of the Giant Guitar Go back down the ladders and around behind the circular chair and go out to the railing by the sea You will now go up onto the neck of the guitar Proceed forward up the open stairs Views here are spectacular ndash take a look around as you continue up the stairs
You will eventually come to a ladder Looking up you can see the neck of the guitar directly above you Climb the ladder all the way to the top Turn You can now walk along the neck of the guitar which looks like a giant ramp At the end of the ramp you get a good view of the Peghead Turn to your right and click the down arrow Take the ladder down as far as you can go Look around at the views You can see the Peghead above you Walk toward it When you can go no further look down You rsquo ll see a ladder going down but the entrance is locked Turn and look down ndash you will see the sphere the same one with the interior disconnected lattices directly below you That is what you will enter when you solve the turret room puzzle
Turn to look back at the body of the guitar Immediately to your left you will see a short post that contains a hotspot Click on it until you see another view into the interior of the sphere If you can rsquo t find the short post here just ignore it it makes no difference in the game
You rsquo ve seen everything there is to see in the neck peghead location Continue back down the ramp ladders stairs and hallway until you find yourself back on the orange stone balcony looking out to sea Make sure you are facing the water then turn left Onto a new area of Alida
The Ruined Houses the Brick Arches and the Lookout Proceed as far into the new area as you can go turn left and keep going until you are sitting in a cage runner also called a cage car Look around until you find the lever and pull it the lever is about midway up the cage ribs The cage runner will take you to the plateau where the former inhabitants of Alida before the band took possession have left ruined houses Exit the cage runner and go through the brick arch When you emerge in the sunshine try to memorize the view You have just emerged from Arch A Look around you to the left You will see Arch B If you can rsquo t see Arch B you rsquo ve stepped too far into the sunlight Backtrack a step turn to face out into the sunlight again THEN look left for Arch B Go through Arch B and proceed up the circular ramp
You are now in the Lookout area and have an aerial view of Alida You can see the jack tower and some rocks If you turn around you rsquo ll see a fancy ldquo N rdquo for north Note that the very short post in front of you is red This will be important later Walk counter clockwise around the lookout area recording the color posts as you go red green yellow white blue pink purple pink purple turquoise Yes the turquoise DOES look almost exactly like the blue And it rsquo s anybody rsquo s guess as to which post is purple and which is pink
Turn around and go back around the circle until you reach a sort of balcony that juts out over the island Look down at the ruins of the houses Look very carefully at the foundations of the houses which are a series of squares in different patterns This will become important later If you are artistically inclined it wouldn rsquo t hurt to draw these patterns on a sort of map or simply use the graphic below
Look back up then turn to your left and look down again You can see the base of the jack tower a long bridge leading to a cabin you can see the roof of the cabin if you look very carefully and also an elevated wooden walkway that hugs a stone mountain These are places you will soon visit ndash it helps to get a sense of where they are
Go back down to the ruins When you step out of Arch B you will see another arch almost directly across from Arch B This is Arch C Proceed in the general direction of Arch C passing the houses as you do so
As you turn left and right heading for Arch C you will reach a point where you can see Arch C on your left and Arch D on your right Go into Arch C A note from Mordack If I could take this style of game and play it forever I rsquo d never complain Like an all day sucker I rsquo m trying not to bite it but it rsquo s hard not to
The Cabins and the Circular Walkway You will go down some stairs and out onto the bridge that you saw earlier Proceed down the bridge until you reach a circular walkway or boardwalk This walkway goes around the jack tower There are four cabins on the walkway each belonging to a band member You are now on your own to explore for awhile Be sure you open everything up and click on everything read everything Then return here to the bridge where it intersects the circular walkway
From the intersection of the bridge and the circular walkway go straight as far as you can go toward the jack tower You will see an ornate door but it is locked at the moment Proceed back out to the intersection of the bridge and the circular walkway You are facing AWAY from the jack tower Turn right Walk to the first cabin and go in If you haven rsquo t opened up the planetary stand do so now and push the sun icon in the middle ndash the sun icon should stay DOWN
On your left is a disc reminiscent of the controls in the turret room You want to move the ball one direction at a time and record the number that shows up when you perform each move You need to do this for each of the three buttons Any time the button returns to ldquo rdquo original setting you have to start over The settings in which the buttons do NOT show a number are blanks The idea is to find a sequence for each button where you can go from ldquo rdquo to ldquo rdquo in numerical order Blanks do NOT effect the sequence ndash you can roll up a blank at any point and still continue with the rest of the number sequence Experiment until you have the entire numerical sequence from ldquo rdquo to ldquo rdquo Record the moves in the sequence as you figure it out
Too impatient Confused by the explanation Okay here rsquo s how to get the correct sequences
With any directional move you should only move the ball ONE position not more Also the directions you rsquo ll read below FIRST instruct you just where to place the cursor WITHOUT touching the ball ndash then the directions specify how to move the cursor which moves the ball The ball will only move when the cursor becomes an open hand
Top Button ndash click to activate it Put the cursor on the left side of the ball ndash move the cursor to the right Put the cursor on the left side of the ball ndash move the cursor to the right Put the cursor on the left side of the ball ndash move the cursor to the right Put the cursor under the ball ndash move the cursor up Put the cursor under the ball ndash move the cursor up Put the cursor under the ball ndash move the cursor up Middle Button ndash click to activate it Put the cursor under the ball ndash move the cursor up Put the cursor to the right of the ball ndash move the cursor to the left Put the cursor to the right of the ball ndash move the cursor to the left Put the cursor to the right of the ball ndash move the cursor to the left Put the cursor under the ball ndash move the cursor up Bottom Button ndash click to activate it Put the cursor to the left of the ball ndash move the cursor to the right Put the cursor under the ball ndash move the cursor up Put the cursor under the ball ndash move the cursor up Put the cursor to the left of the ball ndash move the cursor to the right Put the cursor under the ball ndash move the cursor up Whew Leave this cabin As you exit the door go to your left and enter the next cabin Open the planetary stand if you haven rsquo t already and press the middle sun icon ndash the sun icon should stay DOWN If you haven rsquo t already read Juno rsquo s journal yes this is Juno rsquo s cabin Next go to the device on Juno rsquo s desk ndash the device is called a whabit Click to get a close up then click on the button in the middle of the device You will hear the sound of the insect You need to associate the sound with the black silhouette picture of the insect that is on the top of the device Now drag the handle to the right to bring up the next insect critter Associate the sound with the black silhouette picture Continue this way until you have heard all the sounds and know which picture each sound is associated with Here rsquo s a highly individual checklist of the critters and their sounds Moth cicada low chittering vibration Grasshopper cricket high pitched vibration Fly low pitched buzzing Humpbacked toad car engine not turning over Cute frog ldquo eeeeeeeee ray ray wer eeeeeeeee ray ray rdquo Bee medium pitched buzzing As you pull away from Juno rsquo s desk you can pull the string on his planet mobile if you like Juno has an interest in astronomy among other things Exit Juno rsquo s cabin and go to your left along the circular walkway to the next cabin Enter If you haven rsquo t opened the planetary stand do so and click on the middle sun icon ndash the sun icon should stay DOWN Not much else here is there Exit the cabin and again go to your left until you reach the last cabin Arin rsquo s This is where things get more interesting and informative
Arin rsquo s Cabin The Backstory Place If you haven rsquo t opened up the planetary stand in Arin rsquo s cabin do so and click on the middle sun icon ndash the sun icon should stay DOWN Now go to Arin rsquo s desk Here you rsquo ll find a whabit device similar to the insect critter device in Juno rsquo s room This device reveals the sounds and black silhouette shapes of birds Associate the sounds with the silhouettes Below is a highly individual version of this Bird facing left on perch jungle chuckle Bird facing right on perch twittering Bird with no visible beak ldquo he he he he pause he he Bird facing left no perch squawk Bird with legs and feet ndash shorter body ldquo ree ree ha ha ha oh rdquo Bird with legs and feet ndash taller body creaky sound up and down a musical scale Look at the close ups of the drawings on the wall above Arin rsquo s desk These will help orient you as to the layout of Alida You may be interested in noting the areas where you haven rsquo t been yet
Click on the small bureau on Arin rsquo s desk
Open the top drawer ndash nothing here of special interest Open the second drawer ndash a telegram from someone named Kivas Kivas is the band rsquo s manager and also happens to be Arin rsquo s twin brother So this is what brought Arin back to Alida Click among the other papers in the drawer They include a picture of the moon chimes cabinet showing the symbols on the chimes also a picture of the Peghead showing three of the pegs that hold the strings and three of the knobs that turn the strings around the pegs also a picture of the Switch with two devices next to it and last a picture of one of the Potentiometers with a cutout revealing what the interior looks like
Open the bottom drawer There rsquo s a picture and a news clipping The important clue is the drawing which contains four places on Alida each one corresponding to a band member rsquo s individual vault The most important information ldquo All the vault doors respond to the same codes rdquo Somewhere in your future there will be vault door codes And the code will be the same for each door
Pull back and look at the round device on the desk with buttons that resemble a cassette recorder This contains video recordings of Arin and operates just like a cassette player Listen to all the recordings once to learn more about Alida A note from tigger His voice is ambroooosia
There is a short tune in the first recording Don rsquo t panic ndash you do NOT have to reproduce this tune in any part of the game
Listen again to the short videos in order to make a judgment as to the character of Arin he really flashes that wedding ring around doesn rsquo t he
Uses his left hand a lot too
Observe his clothing facial expressions and hairstyle In one of these recordings Arin seems different Listen one more time to notice which one A note from Becky Where were they going to put the visiting tourists Rebuild the huts into vacation cottages Keep a fleet of houseboats off the cliffs
The final round of information gathering in the cabin area go out onto the circular walkway and listen for the sounds you heard on the circular devices whabits in Arin and Juno rsquo s cabins You need to know WHERE along the circular walkway the sounds are manifested so that you could tell on a diagram where each sound can be heard in relation to the bridge
It may take several seconds to hear everything at each station
To find the stations places on the walkway where you should listen go to the circular walkway where it connects with the bridge Listen to the sounds From there take four steps to the right Listen for the sounds From there take four steps to the right You are now directly behind the jack tower and opposite the bridge Listen Take four steps to the right Listen Take four steps to the right ndash you are now back at the intersection of the circular walkway and the bridge
A note from Rice burner Good luck with the birds I found it very difficult to distinguish their calls
The easiest place to listen for the birds is to go to the back of the jack tower directly opposite the bridge steps from the bridge walkway intersection The bird call there is quite distinctive Now that you know what to listen for go to the three other aforementioned stations and listen for each bird call Now turn the sound up and go back to those same stations and listen for any insects critters Record what you hear at each station You are now finished with the cabin area
Proceed back out down the bridge to the area of the ruined houses
The Pink Devices at the Ruins Sitting on the foundation of each of the ruined houses is a pink device with a series of squares in different patterns along the middle One device is missing a handle To find the handle go to the ruined house immediately in front of brick Arch B If you can rsquo t remember which arch is Arch B refer to the illustration in the section titledThe Ruins the Brick Arches and the Lookout
Click on the hotspot to see a close up of the pink device There on the ground to the right of the pink device is the handle Click on it to pick it up Enjoy the feel of the handle in your hand ndash it rsquo s the only inventory item you rsquo ll get to carry in the game
Go to the device with the missing handle which is immediately in front of brick Arch D the only brick arch in the area that you haven rsquo t entered yet Click the handle into the device Now it rsquo s time to look at the foundations of each house These foundations are in the same configuration as the squares in the middle of the pink devices To solve this puzzle merely walk around the foundation of each house until you are certain which configuration it is and then move the pink device located on that foundation to the matching configuration If you have trouble seeing the configuration of the foundation you can always go back up to the Lookout
Here rsquo s a description of the house foundations Foundation immediately in front of brick arch D the one whose pink device was missing the handle three squares two in line together the third next to the two and centered between them Move the handle on the pink device until this same configuration shows dead center marked by the pink dot
Foundation in the middle of the ruins with what looks like a burgundy and white door panel on the ground in front you rsquo ll need to click on a plank deep in the ruin in order to see the pink device three squares in a backwards L shape Move the handle on the pink device until this same configuration shows dead center marked by the pink dot
Foundation in the middle of the ruins one square Move the handle on the pink device until this same configuration shows dead center marked by the pink dot
Foundation immediately in front of brick Arch B two squares in line together If not already correct move the handle on the pink device until this same configuration shows dead center marked by the pink dot
Foundation with a stack of wood on the foundation two squares situated diagonally Move the handle on the pink device until this same configuration shows dead center marked by the pink dot
It rsquo s finally time to go to brick Arch D ndash the only arch you haven rsquo t entered yet Go through the arch Proceed over a rough wooden bridge through another tunnel and over another bridge until you can proceed no further Look to your left to see a pink device Move the handle If you have set the other pink devices correctly a part of the bridge will come up and you can go down the rest of the bridge to an elevated walkway high above the cabin area Continue down the walkway pausing occasionally to admire the view
The Bunkers and the Vault with a Flashing Lamp Go down a set of stairs under the ground to a grey underground bunker
Go one step into the bunker and then look around There are three rectangular hallways As you turn around you rsquo ll see that one of them shows stairs going up That rsquo s where you just came from The other two rectangular hallways show stairs leading down and one of them has a cement balcony built over it that is accessible by ladder You can climb the ladder if you wish When you come back down go down the hallway with the cement balcony over it
This will take you to Juno rsquo s vault In Juno rsquo s vault is a lamp Get to a position where you can see the lamp clearly The lamp is flashing in a certain pattern There are three sequences of short and or long flashes There is a pause between each sequence The pause between sequence and sequence is not very long
When the third sequence ends after a longer pause the first sequence starts again Write down these sequences
The three sequences are Short short Long short short short Long short short Long short short short Come back into the original bunker You now want to go down the rectangular arch hallway that does NOT have stairs going up and does NOT have a cement balcony Go down more stairs until you reach another bunker You can climb the ladder and look out if you wish Approach the strange device across the room It looks like a guitar sculpture with the Pickup portion highlighted This device is called a spherin
Click to get close to it Grasp the circular handle on the right and move it across to the left You will see a video showing you what to do to set the Pickup ndash simply turn the lever on the controls to the giant guitar strings You rsquo ve done this before but you rsquo ll need to do it again
Go back to the original bunker Go down the rectangular hallway where the stairway is gong up This will take you back to the walkway above the cabins and back to the ruins Once at the ruins go to brick Arch A and proceed back to the cage runner If the cage runner is NOT at the position in which you need it each cage runner terminus has a lever that can be used to summon it
Once inside the cage runner pull the lever to get back to the main portion of Alida
After you rsquo ve arrived back at the main portion of Alida go back down the hallway to the orange stone balcony and down the orange stone arched hallway until you get to the central chamber and the moon chime cabinet Approach the cabinet and play a tone any tone This triggers the next thing that you will find in Arin rsquo s vault
But first ndash a slight but important detour well maybe not so slight
A note from mjartisian My terrible sense of direction kicks in periodically and I forget where I saw some other puzzle that I have an idea about how to solve now Other times I remember where everything is and have no trouble finding it It must be senility setting in
The Turret Room and the Black Sphere with Interior Lattices Step out from the moon chime cabinet and go down the farthest black rectangular hallway the one closest to the giant plectrum Continue until you are back in the turret room You now have the code to get access to the black sphere
Use the sequences from the disc with similar balls that you worked out in the cabin Below is a copy of the sequence Again the instructions are to first place the cursor on a spot NEXT to the ball then move the cursor in the suggested direction thereby moving the ball one position You can only move the ball when the cursor changes into the open hand position If the sequence doesn rsquo t work put the ball back to the dot and try again
NOTE Before starting each sequence make sure the balls are all set to the face which shows the black dot ndash this is where you must begin
Top Ball Put the cursor on the left side of the ball ndash move the cursor to the right Put the cursor on the left side of the ball ndash move the cursor to the right Put the cursor on the left side of the ball ndash move the cursor to the right Put the cursor under the ball ndash move the cursor up Put the cursor under the ball ndash move the cursor up Put the cursor under the ball ndash move the cursor up Middle Ball Put the cursor under the ball ndash move the cursor up Put the cursor to the right of the ball ndash move the cursor to the left Put the cursor to the right of the ball ndash move the cursor to the left Put the cursor to the right of the ball ndash move the cursor to the left Put the cursor under the ball ndash move the cursor up Bottom Ball Put the cursor to the left of the ball ndash move the cursor to the right Put the cursor under the ball ndash move the cursor up Put the cursor under the ball ndash move the cursor up Put the cursor to the left of the ball ndash move the cursor to the right Put the cursor under the ball ndash move the cursor up If you have inputted the sequence correctly you will see an interior metal lattice move into position after each sequence is finished If all three lattices have moved you are ready to enter the black sphere You will see a short video indicating that the entrance to the ladder up on the Peghead has been unlocked Remember this particular location way up on the guitar rsquo s neck You can now enter the previously locked entrance Go back out to the orange stone balcony While facing the sea from the balcony turn right and walk down into the black rectangular hallway make a right at the corner follow the hallway until the end then make a left You will see an opening into the sea past the circular chair with the ladder Go past the ladder out to the sea and all the way back up the guitar rsquo s neck to the ladder entrance that once was locked
If you rsquo re feeling lost use the instructions in the section entitledExploring the Neck and Peghead of the Giant Guitarto once again reach the Peghead and the locked ladder
Go through the previously locked entrance and down a ladder now formed from the metal lattices all the way down Turn around and look up ndash you will see a symbol a triangle with a line top to bottom Write down this symbol and where it is located black sphere under the Peghead and put exclamation marks next to it
A note from mjartisian My notes are a disaster I have notes on my notes
Step forward and go down another ladder all the way to the bottom Turn around and go into Luke rsquo s vault area In the vault is a red guitar On its neck is a code This code will eventually be entered into the numbers cabinet back in the orange stone central chamber
Continue around the back of the vault and go down yet another ladder Turn around and view a wire grating with a lever on the top right Pull the lever up You will see a weight being drawn up which when it finally stops is identifiable as the weight that was blocking the odd door with a peephole entrance at the end of the bridge that runs out from the black rectangular hallway off of the orange stone chamber the bridge next to the turret room Turn around and go back out of the vault and climb all the way out of the black sphere Proceed back down the guitar neck and various ladders
And on Your Way Back hellip
As you return into the body of the guitar stop by the structure that resembles a rounded red chair with the ladder coming out of it Climb the ladder into the purple vault all the way up to the top You will see a new code on a piece of paper taped to the vault window This code is for the moon chime cabinet and looks like this Each symbol is in the interior of a triangle Line top to bottom Right angled line Empty circle Line top to bottom plus line side to side Solid circle Line side to side plus inverted ldquo V rdquo Left angled line Right angled line plus empty circle Left angled line plus empty circle Inverted ldquo V rdquo Go back down the ladders and turn your back to the water Continue down the black rectangular hallway to the end Turn right and go to the end Turn left and go past the balcony and turn into the arched orange stone hallway to the orange stone central chamber You have the code for the moon chime cabinet and the code for the numbers cabinet but just ignore them for a moment
The Experiment Gone Wrong Instead get as close as you can to the giant plectrum Turn until you can see the columns and the switch boxes on them the giant fingers will be in the background Walk over to the nearest box and flip the switch Go down the black rectangular hallway closest to the giant plectrum it will be slightly to the right of the column with the switch you just flipped Keep going around the corner and out over the bridge until you reach an odd segmented spherical structure with a symbol on top This is the water house Make a note of the symbol triangle with an empty circle Note the location where it occurs and put exclamation marks around it
Walk down the steps and into the structure Here you will see the experiment gone wrong mentioned in Juno rsquo s journal in his cabin It is STILL going wrong Fortunately the game doesn rsquo t let you get too close because there isn rsquo t anyone handy to rescue you if you are drawn into the experiment rsquo s field Turn around Leave the structure and take a step outside Look carefully on the arched railing in front of you ndash on the right bar there is a well camouflaged button Click on it it doesn rsquo t have a hotspot A metal plate will descend in front of you Note the way it looks This will be used later Click on the button again to put the metal plate away Then look up To the left you will see a black square This will be used along with the metal plate once you rsquo ve found the correct sequences to input into the metal plate
Puzzle Cabinet ndash The Numbers Puzzle Return down the bridge and the hallways to the orange stone central chamber Now is the time to enter the code you found on the red guitar into the numbers cabinet this is in the middle arched alcove in the orange stone central chamber Here rsquo s the code again When you enter the final number you rsquo ll hear a beeping sound and the nearest T runner will open its protective glass shield Time for a ride
Take a seat in the T runner and grab the control switch on the upper right You will take a ride over the guitar neck and INTO the Peghead The Peghead is probably the most difficult puzzle in the game so we rsquo ll save it for last We are here simply for a single piece of information
A note from LadyKestrel The peghead puzzle was my nemesis
A Brief Visit to the Peghead Step out of the T runner Turn to your right and take a step or two until you are under the metal arches Turn left and proceed under the arches to a position in the room so that you are directly opposite the T runner When you can go no further if you look to your left you rsquo ll see an opening Go in and walk around the windy room From the angle next to the circular steps down you can look into the golden design and see the letter ldquo N rdquo just like the letter ldquo N rdquo in the golden device in the Lookout above the ruined houses Turn and go down the circular steps
At the bottom of the circular steps you will see a circular control device Ignore it for now Above you will see a metal balcony ndash take the steps leading up to this balcony Get as far onto the balcony as you can and look down There is a symbol a triangle with a left angled line Make a note of the symbol and its location and put exclamation marks around it
Now go out of the room and up into the windy room by going up the circular stairs Approach the wall behind the circular stairs look to your left and go back into the central Peghead room Turn right and then walk under the metal arches until you see the T runner Wrestling with the challenges here will come later For now get in the T runner grab the control mechanism and return to the orange stone central chamber We are finally ready for the moon chime puzzle
Puzzle Cabinet The Moon Chime Puzzle at Last Return to the moon chime cabinet Remember the symbols we saw on the wall of the vault
If you haven rsquo t been able to find the symbols on the wall of the vault here rsquo s what you must do Play one tone ndash any tone ndash on the moon chime cabinet Then go back to the vault instructions on how to get there are in the section titledThe Ladder to the Place that is Purple
Here are symbols again Line top to bottom Right angled line Empty circle Line top to bottom plus line side to side Solid circle Line side to side plus inverted ldquo V rdquo Left angled line Right angled line plus empty circle Left angled line plus empty circle Inverted ldquo V rdquo Some of these symbols are the same as the symbols on the green gray chimes But others are the equivalent of two symbols added together i e ldquo right angled line PLUS empty circle rdquo The symbols that have COMBINED two symbols from the green grey chimes belong to the black chimes For example the black chime referred to above is in between two green grey chimes one that has the right angled line symbol and one that has the empty circle symbol
Look closely at each chime and note how a curved arm comes out of each chime ending in a circular key The keys coming out of the green gray chimes are brown The keys coming out of the black chimes are black If you rsquo ve played the piano these keys are set up exactly like piano keys
Using the above symbols in order and figuring out which black keys are required input the moon chime sequence by clicking on the circular keys
If you are still confused think of the brown circular keys as being numbered left to right to Now think of the black circular keys as being arranged left to right A to E Input the following sequence A B D C You will hear a beeping sound and the nearest T runner rsquo s protective glass shield will be raised Get into the T runner and get ready for a ride to the Switch
The Switch and the Water Tone Puzzle Step out of the T runner You are now preparing to explore and conquer one of the locations that is the heart and soul of Alida There are three areas in the giant guitar that must be set correctly before you can properly play its strings the Switch where you are now the Peghead where we stopped briefly to record the symbol and the Potentiometers we haven rsquo t been there yet
We rsquo ll set the Switch first because it rsquo s easiest Well in some ways it rsquo s easiest
There are three rooms in the Switch area You can explore a bit here if you like ndash we rsquo ll meet back at the T runner when you rsquo re finished
From the T runner turn to your right and go up the stairs to a platform which supports the giant ball base of the Switch At the top of the stairs you will notice a lever that is hanging down on your left You will need to use this later On the ball base you will see a keyboard symbol that shows an octave keys as it would appear on a piano the moon chime cabinet had a similar setup but used circular rather than rectangular keys The seventh key counting only the lighter keys not the dark ones is darkened This on the piano is the ldquo B rdquo note or tone
Turn around and go back down the stairs Ignore the room that has what looks like another T runner in it Instead go into the room with the very large white cylinder in the middle This is the water tone machine On one of the walls in this room is a picture of a keyboard like the one on the Switch ball base In front of the keyboard picture is a small stand with two triangles on top this controls the water tone machine Turn around and note which key is highlighted on the picture behind you and where the small white ball is located in the top triangle on the stand It will be important to note where the small white ball rests after each note is played and compare that to the highlighted key in the picture behind you To play each note click on the small bottom triangle on the stand in front of you
A note from Becky My game crashed a lot while I was using the water tone machine To get through this section I had to save my game after each note played Technical note This problem can be addressed by downloading the Alida patch herehttp www alidagame com alidaPatch html North American version only ndash the patch is already included in the European version of Alida
If you don rsquo t wish to take the notes yourself here they are ndash again here we are numbering only the lighter colored keys NOT the dark keys Key counting only the lighter keys ball is in top left corner ldquo C rdquo on a piano Key ball goes to dead center ldquo D rdquo on a piano Key ball goes to bottom corner ldquo E rdquo on a piano Key ball goes to top right corner ldquo F rdquo on a piano Key ball goes to top left NOT the corner ldquo G rdquo on a piano Key ball goes to middle left NOT the corner ldquo A rdquo on a piano Key ball goes to middle right NOT the corner ldquo B rdquo on a piano Key ball goes to top right NOT the corner high ldquo C rdquo on a piano Remember the symbol on the ball base that showed the thkey ldquo B rdquo highlighted You need to set the water chime machine for the thkey or ldquo B rdquo by getting the small white ball on the stand to go to the middle right NOT the corner Do this by pushing the lower triangle on the stand until the small white ball reaches this position checking behind you to see the keyboard picture if you want confirmation
When the thkey is highlighted on the wall go back to the middle room and go up the stairs Now it rsquo s time to pull that lever You rsquo ll hear a beeping sound and the ball base of the Switch will rotate revealing a staircase Go up it At the top of the staircase is a small window You can see the conservatory in the distance ndash this was also built by Arin And on the left in the foreground you can see part of a black metal sphere a different one than the sphere you were in earlier
If you turn to the left you will see a sketch of the numbers cabinet in the orange stone chamber back in the main part of the guitar Above that is a code
A note from Becky I like to think of this as the dotty eggs code
Does the oval shape with dots remind you of anything else you rsquo ve seen in the game Never mind we rsquo ll eventually find it
Now turn around until you see the large symbol on the wall Note the symbol ndash a triangular shape with a solid circle write down where you found it and put exclamation marks around it
You could also write down the dotty egg code but it rsquo s probably easier to just refer to the picture below
The First T flyer Go down the stairs and then down the other stairs into the main room Now it rsquo s time to find the thing that looks like a T runner but is sitting in the middle of the third room without access to a tunnel or track This is a T flyer Even more fun than the runner version
A note from Becky You won rsquo t believe what this puppy can do ndash I didn rsquo t Get in the T flyer and grab the mechanism on the top at the right On the left a graphic will appear showing you the jack tower surrounded by the circular walkway Note where the bridge is in relation to the rest of the graphic Afterwards silhouettes of birds appear on four buttons You need to enter the bird silhouettes in their correct position according to the calls you recorded earlier
If you get stuck this is the solution Top button Bird facing left no perch Bottom button Bird with legs and feet ndash shorter body may already be set Left button Bird facing left on perch Right button Bird with legs and feet ndash taller body Save your game here in case you want to replay this ride Remember Juno rsquo s journal talking about how the T flyer can go to any point in three dimensional space Get ready Now grab the mechanism on the top right again
The Conservatory Exit the T flyer Then go forward and up the stairs You rsquo ll be in the conservatory Arin rsquo s private sanctuary You can explore here at your leisure We rsquo ll meet back at the window on this level with the lattice screen At the moment this window is to your left
Okay turn so that the latticed window is behind you and proceed to the stairway downstairs to your immediate left This is the dungeon By the door is a dial with two notches that could be set at a certain number If you touch the controls then turn to your left the tiny rectangular window will open and you will have a short conversation withLaval If you keep failing to set the device correctly and continually click on the window Laval will give you hints as to how to free him
Big Hint The first number on the dial is ldquo rdquo not ldquo rdquo
Lavaldoesn rsquo t give you this hint
Starting at the top with ldquo rdquo set the inner arrow at ldquo rdquo and the outer arrow at ldquo rdquo The dungeon door will open
A note from tigger One problem I did have with this bit was that sometimes the pointer would add an extra click by itself so count carefully
SAVE YOUR GAME HERE
Look in at the symbol on the floor A triangle shape with a solid circle Write down where you saw the symbol and surround it with exclamation marks
Now that you rsquo ve saved your game if you wish to see one of the ldquo bad rdquo endings go into the dungeon
A note from tigger Eww why are there so many imprisoned people
They keep making me jump
A note from LadyKestrel Yes but they rsquo re cute aren rsquo t they
A note from tigger Cute
You think these guys are cute
One just slugged me over the head and locked me up somewhere
Hummmph had to go back to a savegame which luckily wasn rsquo t much further back
Once you rsquo ve restored your game go back up the stairs and into the conservatory Turn to your left and proceed over to the next set of stairs going down Take them down into a study area ndash Arin rsquo s study On the desk you will find a letter to Julia Arin rsquo s wife Read both parts of the letter particularly the letter on the right which gives you a huge clue
If you set everything correctly you can open the vault doors Since you probably aren rsquo t particularly interested in opening the vaults with just a flashing lamp or an old guitar and since the locks on these vaults are disabled anyway there are only two vaults that are important the main vault with all the treasure and Arin rsquo s vault where the prisoner posted the moon chime symbols Which will you open or will you open both
Something to ponder while you complete the rest of the game hellip
You will need to figure out the push button code which you will input into the green buttons on the vault doors before the sound code can work The only way to get the sound code to work is to correctly set the Switch Peghead Potentiometers and Pickup The way to discover the setting for the Switch is to go back upstairs to the conservatory and solve the model puzzle
The Conservatory Model Puzzle Upstairs in the middle of the conservatory you will find a model of the guitar with two controls There rsquo s a lever on the left that highlights different parts of the guitar ndash and you have written down a symbol for each of those parts during your travels through Alida start looking for those exclamation marks Plus you know which symbol matches each key on the moon chime cabinet There are also two small triangles on the model exactly like the ones you saw on the water tone machine controls And you know how to move the small white ball so as to represent each key on the keyboard you saw in the Switch area ndash a keyboard that represents tones or notes exactly like the ones on the moon chime cabinet
So what do you do with the model puzzle You need to set it so that the small white ball is in the correct position corresponding to the symbols you found in your travels Here rsquo s how you do it If the model doesn rsquo t show the ldquo experiment gone wrong rdquo house water house highlighted use the left lever until it IS highlighted The symbol for the waterhouse was the empty circle The empty circle is key ldquo rdquo on the moon chime cabinet To enter key five click on the small triangle until the small white ball goes to the top left NOT the corner When that is set correctly use the left lever to advance the highlight to the metal sphere with interior lattices The symbol for the metal sphere is a triangle with a line top to bottom The line top to bottom is key ldquo rdquo on the moon chime cabinet To enter key one click on the small triangle until the small white ball goes to the top left corner It might already be there
Now advance the lever on the left so that it highlights the Switch The symbol for the Switch is a triangle with a solid circle The solid circle is key ldquo rdquo on the moon chime cabinet To enter key eight click on the small triangle until the small white ball goes to the top right NOT the corner Now advance the lever on the left until it highlights the Peghead The Peghead symbol is a triangle with a left angled line The left angled line is number ldquo rdquo on the moon chime cabinet To enter number four click on the little triangle until the small ball is in the top right corner
Save your game here as you might want to view the upcoming cutscene again later
Now advance the lever on the left so that it highlights the conservatory The symbol for the conservatory is a triangle with a solid circle The solid circle is number ldquo rdquo on the moon chime cabinet To enter number eight click on the little triangle until the small ball goes to the top right NOT the corner
A note from GeeGee Yay I did it
Seems I forgot a little something ndash i e both the Conservatory Dungeon and the Switch locations were at the same position on the triangle You will hear a beeping noise The model starts to animate and then something huge moves over the conservatory If the beeping doesn rsquo t start go through the settings on the model to make sure they are correct
The lattice over the window opens Go through the opening into the metal sphere it now looks like a room with a metal sculpture in it When you rsquo re in as far as you can go look down You rsquo ll see a guitar sculpture with the Switch in red Click to get closer then move the handle from the right to the left You rsquo ll see a video of the small ball in the top right corner and then the lever by the ball base of the Switch being moved
This is a nice payoff for a difficult multi step puzzle
A note from chiefette Thanks for the tips and the tap on the shoulder
Final Settings for the Switch Now you must go back to the Switch then pull the lever to return the Switch to its original state then set the water tone machine so the small ball is in the top right corner and then use the lever by the Switch again to set it correctly
Go back down the stairs to the T flyer This will take you back to the Switch You don rsquo t need to enter the bird code this time
As you zoom back to the Switch note that the black metal sphere is now attached to the back of the conservatory
Go back to the Switch and go up the stairs Look out the window and again see the metal sphere has moved Go back down to the ball base of the Switch and pull the lever Now go back to the water tone machine and hit the lower triangle button until the small ball is in the top right corner Then return to the Switch go up the stairs and pull the lever You rsquo ll hear beeping and the Switch will reset You are now finished with the Switch Congratulations On to the Potentiometers
Return via the T runner NOT the T flyer which brings you back to the orange stone central chamber Walk straight forward toward the giant fingers then turn left
For a further plot development go into the black rectangular hallway the one closest to the moon chime cabinet and through the vault area
Then turn the lever to play the giant guitar one more time On the round video screen you rsquo ll receive information from one of the twin brothers
Return to the orange stone central chamber and turn left again Continue until you are in front of the farthest alcove with Juno rsquo s astronomical symbols cabinet
Puzzle Cabinet ndash The Astronomical Symbols Think back to the vault with the flashing lamp Remember the sequences of flashes you recorded Here they are again Short short Long short short short Long short short Long short short short The first button on the left belongs to the first sequence you recorded form the lamp in Juno rsquo s vault Hold the mouse over the image to count the flashes and look at the wood behind the imager to see when the light flashes you are looking for the image with two short flashes Once you rsquo ve reached that image leave it and go to the next button This time advance through the images until you get to one with flashes like this Long short short short Long short short Last of all go to the third button Advance the images until you get to the sequence Long short short short Hint the flashing sequences end with a kind of flicker that looks a bit like a flash If you can rsquo t get the sequence right try subtracting one flash at the end of each sequence to see if that solves the problem
Left to right the images should be Comet Q tip nebula cloud cloudy day ten point sun star
When the above is entered into the cabinet you will hear a beeping sound and a T runner will appear Step into the T runner and grab the control at the top right Enjoy the ride
Exit the T runner You are now in the Potentiometer area ndash that part near the bottom of the guitar with adjustable knobs Explore at your leisure and we rsquo ll meet back at the T runner when you rsquo re done First we rsquo ll take a look down one of the hallways in the Potentiometer area so that you have an idea of what rsquo s going on here
Make sure you rsquo re in front of the T runner NOT the T flyer the runner will have its glass shield open Step out just far enough into the room so that when you turn you don rsquo t JUST see the T runner behind you three clicks from sitting in the T runner This spot is important as all descriptions in this section of the walkthrough use this spot for orientation
Turn to your left You will see a hallway to your immediate left that rsquo s what we rsquo ll explore and you rsquo ll see a stand for turning on the lights If you rsquo ve already turned on the lights for the hallway to your left go straight to the hallway
If you haven rsquo t already turned on the lights go to the stand get up close to it grab the little knob on the right and pull ndash then click on the button and step back When you leave the light stand turn and step out one click You will see a bit of the T flyer and the lit hallway on your right Enter the hallway
Go all the way to the end Touch one of the bars on the elevator cage and it opens It is very easy here to click the wrong way and get blipped back into the hallway headed back into the central room If this happens turn around and go back into the elevator
Step inside Again touch one of the bars and the door will close To your right are the elevator rsquo s buttons Touch the top button twice to go to the second floor Exit the elevator and find another light stand Turn on the light Look up and turn to your right You should see a metal ladder This is the only Potentiometer that allows you to climb up the side of the interior ndash we rsquo ll be doing this in a minute Go back into the elevator touch the bar to close the door and hit the down button once When the elevator arrives at the floor below touch the bar to exit the elevator You rsquo ll see a planetary stand in front of you like the ones in the cabins Click on the button to open it Click on the planet that is farthest to the right ndash a grey swirling one The walls will rotate twice
A note from Becky I rsquo ve just been up the elevator shaft to the dome where the WALLS move The place is fantastic
Who on earth ARE these people They can rsquo t just be a rock band There rsquo s something more going on
Turn to your right and cross the room and go up the ladder all the way to the top it rsquo s interesting to look across at the globe you see illuminated before you You will see a hole in the roof Climb through it and look out the small square window ndash you now have an idea of where you are on the top of the giant guitar Climb back down the ladder and back to the planetary stand you can climb up after clicking on each of the planets if you want in order to see the globe illuminated but this is the only position in which you can climb to the roof
Click on the sun in the middle of the planetary stand Hmmm More flashes Each planet has its own sequence of flashes which is revealed when you click on the planet and then click on the sun Record these and associate them with the appropriate planet as they will be important later Return to the elevator and go down into the central room
You are now looking for the T flyer which has the glass shield closed and a white shell like design on the wall behind it Wonder where this one goes
The Second T flyer Enter the T flyer and grab the mechanism at the top right On the left an image of the circular walkway around the jack tower once again appears apparently Juno didn rsquo t want just anybody using the T flyers so each has a code lock You need to punch in the insects critters you heard at each station on the circular walkway
Frustrated Okay here rsquo s the solution all four buttons should show the moth cicada ndash yes you DID hear the cicada at every station Tricky right Grab the mechanism at the top right again and hold on tight The Jack Tower Exit the T flyer
You are now INSIDE the jack tower Behind the T flyer and across the room is something that resembles a wooden podium This is the next puzzle to solve Get in front of it and move the handle as far up as it will go Four planets will appear on the stands around the room Record a brief description of each of these planets they will appear differently in each game so I can rsquo t describe them Behind each planet is a porthole Turn to your left to see the porthole associated with the planet closest to you on your left Go over to the porthole look through it You will see the cement circles out in the bay Now look down Directly in front of the cement circles is a cabin and from the cabin rsquo s roof comes a series of light flashes Record the location and the sequence of flashes If you don rsquo t see light flashes it rsquo s because you neglected earlier in the game to press down the middle sun symbol in the planetary stands in all the cabins
Go back to the podium facing towards the center of the room Turn to your right to see the porthole associated with the planet stand on your right and closest to the podium Go over and look through it You will see the bay with an island mountain springing out of it Look down and record the sequence of flashes and the location where you are seeing them
Return to the podium You will now attempt to walk over to the farther porthole on your left to record the information you see out of it It is a little tricky to maneuver here because you have to go around the T flyer You will know you have reached the correct porthole if after walking up to the porthole when you turn right you see a hallway that leads to an elevator Look through the porthole and you will see mountains with the raised walkway that eventually leads to the bunkers and Juno rsquo s vault Look down and record the flashes and the location Return to the podium You will now attempt to walk over to the farther porthole on your right Again this is tricky You rsquo ll know you rsquo ve done it when you see a scene you haven rsquo t seen before ndash in this case very tall mountains and if you look closely the Lookout on one of them with a small strip of the plateau holding the ruins below it Look down record the light flash sequence and the location
What Does the Jack Tower Have to do with the Planetary Stands in the Cabins
Now it rsquo s time to take that elevator From your current position the elevator will be the next opening on your right Take it down to the ground floor and open the door You are now down among the cabins Walk out to the circular walkway and to your left If you look carefully through the trees you will see the raised walkway leading to the bunkers So the cabin in this location is the one with the following light flash sequence short short Long short short short Go in the cabin and look at the planetary stand You will notice that the planet that is currently spinning is the same one that appeared in front of the porthole when you used the control lever on the podium in the jack tower Exit the cabin and turn to your right As you approach the next cabin you will see the cement circles out in the bay So this cabin is the one whose roof flashes short short short Long short Go in the cabin and look at the planetary stand Again you will discover that the planet that is currently spinning is the same one that appeared in front of that particular porthole when you used the control lever on the podium in the jack tower
Further exploration of the remaining two cabins will reveal the same pattern Whichever planet on the planetary stand in the cabins is spinning will be reflected up in the jack tower So apparently the puzzle demands that you set each planetary stand in each cabin to match the planet associated with the light flash sequence from that particular cabin ndash the light flash sequence that shows from the roof of each cabin when you look through the porthole in the jack tower
A note from Becky As usual I had the puzzle only half right I should just write down my assumptions when I start a puzzle then midway through reverse them
And how can you find a light flash sequence for every planet That information was back at the Potentiometers If you have recorded the light flashes from the planetary stand in the Potentiometer we explored together you will note that one of the planets in it has the same light flash sequence as the porthole that looks out at the Lookout ndash short Long The planet in the Potentiometers that has the short Long sequence is the large orange planet at the very top Now your job is to return to the Potentiometers and find out which planets match the remaining light flashes from the remaining cabins
Go back into the jack tower using the elevator and take the T flyer back to the main room in the Potentiometers area Once there walk straight across until you are in front of the T runner in the middle of the room with your back to the T runner in the same spot as earlier Remember that we have already found the answer to the jack tower puzzle for the hallway on your immediate left You don rsquo t have to return there so ignore it Instead go to the lit hallway on your left ndash you DON rsquo T need to turn to see it ndash that is between the light stand and the T flyer Go up in the elevator to the second floor and turn on the light if you haven rsquo t already Then go down a floor and open up the planetary stand
Click on each planet watch the walls rotate and then click on the sun button in the center to see and record the light flashes for each planet
Return to the Potentiometers Area So you are looking for a planet in each Potentiometer that has a signature light flash sequence These three sequences you rsquo ve already recorded the fourth sequence in the Potentiometer you explored when you first arrived are short short short Long short short short Long short short short
Long Long short short short short short
Turns out the sequence that fits here is Long Long short short short short short ndash this sequence belongs to the planet farthest to the right which is vaguely earth looking
Return to the T runner in the central room Remember the glass shield will be open on it
Step out into the room You have already recorded the necessary information for the hallways on your left Now you need the information from the hallways on your right If you haven rsquo t already you rsquo ll need to turn on the light at the light stand on your right Do so Go back to the T runner remember the glass shield is open Take one step into the middle of the room to the same spot as earlier Turn to your right
We rsquo ll explore this hallway next
Go down the hallway up two stories turn on the light then return to the planetary stand below You are looking for the following sequence short short short Long short OR short short Long short short short This time the sequence is short short Long short short short The planet that matches the sequence is the one farthest to the right with a dark swirling color
Go back to the central chamber and the T runner again Take one step out into the central chamber from the T runner to the same spot as earlier The last hallway is on your right between the T flyer and the light stand Go down it go up to the second floor to turn on the light and then down a floor to the planetary stand You are looking for this sequence short short short Long short The planet that matches the sequence is the one farthest to the left with a dark purple color
Final Solution Jack Tower Puzzle You now want to get back to the jack tower and the cabins So take the T flyer the glass shield is closed Once in the jack tower take the elevator down to the cabins Go out to the circular walkway and take a left The first cabin is the one with the raised walkway in the back The planet associated with that light flash sequence is the planet with dark grayish swirls on the far right Go into the cabin and click on this planet Go out of the cabin and take a right The next cabin is the one with the bay and the circular cement bunkers behind it The planet associated with that light flash sequence is the dark purple planet on the far left Go into the cabin and click on this planet
Go out of the cabin and take a right The next cabin is the one with the bay and the island mountain behind it The planet associated with that light flash sequence is the planet farthest to the right that is vaguely earth looking Go into the cabin and click on this planet
Go out of the cabin and take a right The next cabin is the one with the Lookout behind it The planet associated with that light flash sequence is the large orange planet at the very top Go into the cabin and click on this planet
Come out of the cabin and turn to your right Proceed to the jack tower elevator and take it up Go to the podium and push the lever up as far as it can go The planets that you selected on the planetary stands in the cabins will appear one by one You will know the puzzle is solved correctly if the lever on its own goes all the way to the top and the T flyer turns toward you and the glass shield raises up Enter the T flyer grab the mechanism on the top right and the T flyer rises through the floor as though it is an elevator
Juno rsquo s Sanctuary You have arrived at the place where the mysterious multi talented Juno conducts more of his experiments Nice view of Alida isn rsquo t it Click down to see views out the lower windows
On Juno rsquo s desk are actual photographs of planets that he has taken ndash with nothing recognizable as belonging to our solar system Note the drawing of the telescope which includes an integrated bi sphere device Juno has used this technology to see further than anyone else Makes the Hubble look antiquated There rsquo s a telegram from Kivas just like the one to Arin Apparently Juno returned to Alida the way Arin and Leval did So where IS he There rsquo s also a graphic showing the entrance to the original bi sphere machine ndash the entrance is a circular area behind the experiment gone wrong What would happen if this technology fell into the wrong hands
Further into the room is another guitar sculpture with the Potentiometers in red Again click to get closer and then move the handle on the right
You will see a series of video sequences that show a particular planet turning This is the final way to set each planetary stand in the Potentiometer area in preparation for the final climactic strum I rsquo ve included a description of the planetary stand including one easily identifiable planet on each plus the description of the planet that is turning the one that should be set at the Potentiometer site
Four planets a dark orange planet at the top Spinning planet is the bottom one blue grayish and swirling
Four planets a white swirling planet at the top Spinning planet is the far left one dark orange
Five planets most identifiable one is actually the one that rsquo s spinning ndash looks like clouds in a blue sky
Five planets including the earth like one on the far right Spinning planet is near the middle sun and just below it ndash a blue white swirling planet
Final Settings for the Potentiometers It rsquo s time to take the T flyer back to the floor below Once there return to the podium device and pull the lever down to the bottom setting The T flyer will turn Get in the T flyer grab the top right mechanism and the T flyer will return to the Potentiometers Once there leave the T flyer and walk across the room to the T runner
Once again we rsquo ll use the T runner for orientation From a position in which you are sitting in the T runner glass shield up step forward three clicks into the middle of the room when you turn you won rsquo t see just the T runner behind you Turn left Go down that hallway Up one floor This planetary stand is the one with four planets and the dark orange planet on top Click on the bottom blue grayish swirling planet Return to the T runner remember glass shield up
Step into the middle Don rsquo t turn You rsquo re taking the hallway to the left between the T flyer and the light stand Go up to the planetary stand It rsquo s the one with five planets and the earth like planet on the far right Click on the blue white swirling planet below the sun Return to the T runner
Step into the middle Turn right You rsquo re going into the hallway on your immediate right Up to the planetary stand It rsquo s the one with four planets white swirling planet on top Click on the dark orange planet on the left Return to the T runner
Step into the middle Don rsquo t turn but go to the hallway on your right between the T flyer and the light stand Five planets one that looks like a cloudy sky Click on the one with a cloudy sky
No fanfare No Halleluiah chorus but you have finished with the Potentiometers A note from tigger There was no indication I had completed whatever I had to do hence the bafflement
OK onwards and upwards
Take the T runner back to the orange stone central chamber You now have two challenges left the code for the buttons on the vault doors and tuning the Peghead
Code for the Buttons on the Vault Doors From the orange stone chamber take the dark rectangular hallway entrance that is closest to the giant plectrum Go down it across the bridge and to the experiment gone wrong water house Do you remember the small rectangular button we accessed on the pipe Turn your back toward the water house and then push the button Controls will come down before you
Now referring to your own notes or the picture in the section titled The Switch and the Water Tone Puzzle enter each dotty egg code into the controls then look up quickly to your left and record what you see Note ndash as you will see each symbol represents a letter of the alphabet ndash once you know which symbol matches which letter you can put them in the multiple places they occur in the code message ndash for instance there are letter ldquo O rdquo s in the message
When completely transcribed the message reads like this code for all vault doors set numbers to two press button for six seconds
When you rsquo ve finished your transcription click on the button to send the controls out of the way so you can move again
Remember that the dotty egg code you just transcribed showed a drawing of the numbers cabinet beneath it Let rsquo s go back to the orange stone central chamber and take another look at the numbers cabinet middle cabinet Go back over the bridge etc
until you are in the orange stone chamber The numbers cabinet as you are facing into the chamber should be on your right Approach it Set all the numbers on it to the number two Then hold down the lower middle button until you see a change occur When it does occur record it
Up down down up down up down down This is the sequence you use in pushing the green buttons on the vault doors
Now we rsquo ll enter this first set of codes into the door to Arin rsquo s vault and the door to the main vault the one with all the money and treasure in it To enter the code into the main vault door go to the black rectangular hallway in the orange stone chamber the one farthest from the giant plectrum until you reach the vault door Get a close up look at the door and then use the code above another way of looking at the code Top button bottom button bottom button top button bottom button top button bottom button bottom button
After you rsquo ve inputted this you should see the left green button light up To enter this code into Arin rsquo s vault go out of the orange stone chamber onto the orange stone balcony turn right go straight until you hit the wall turn right go straight until you hit the wall then left again until you get to the circular chair structure with the ladder leading up Go all the way up the ladder into the vault and enter the same top bottom code into the vault door The button on the left should glow green Later in the game you can decide which vault doors you want to keep keyed to open it rsquo s very easy to disable the locks Return to the orange stone chamber for the final challenge the Peghead
A note from LadyKestrel I was so confused with the peghead and another conundrum not to be mentioned yet that I thought my copy of the game should be retitledAliduh
The Peghead ndash Symbols and Flashing Lights Go into the middle alcove in the orange stone chamber ndash the one with the numbers cabinet in it Get into the T runner and take it to the Peghead central hall The Peghead central hall is as confusing as the Potentiometer hall was It looks a bit like the interior of a cathedral with arches everywhere There are a few landmarks however ndash the T runner station a control device in front of the central screw and a back wall leading to the fancy ldquo N rdquo sculpture and the stairway down to the motor heads device Explore a bit in order to get oriented and we rsquo ll meet back at the T runner
The control device in front of the central screw allows you to switch power from the right set of pegs to the left set of pegs When power is on you can adjust tune the pegs one at a time on that particular side For now hit the button to switch power over to the right side only if it isn rsquo t already switched to the right side Turn right There are three identical entrances on the right and you rsquo ll need to explore them all
Go to the first entrance nearest the T runner and down a set of stairs You rsquo ll see a round device also called an arrow controller with two symbols on it a semi circle and what looks like a sideways ldquo rdquo There is a pointer on the device If you hit the button on the device you will see screws turning and the face of the device will rotate so that a different symbol is indicated by the pointer The round devices provide the means for turning the pegs which tunes the strings The symbols on the round devices represent two settings for the pegs
Go out and up the stairs Turn right and go into the middle entrance Directly in front of you before going down the stairs is an oval opening Go in it and go up the stairs then look out the window You will see a peg with a light glowing in it Now go down the stairs out through the oval opening and to your left until you find a set of stairs going down Take the stairs down and you rsquo ll find another round device but this one has an arrow on its face Press the button and the arrow turns Now go back up the stairs and into the oval opening you will have to turn back around near the entrance to the central Peghead hall to do this Up at the top looking out the window you will see a peg with a different colored light flashing
What is happening here
Go back down the stairs and start out towards the central hall Keep going until you see the metal arches for the first time Remember this position as you will be returning to it several times
Turn back around and note the position of the oval opening you just came out of Now go back down the stairs to the round device with the arrow on it and push the button again Return up the stairs go in the oval opening and look out the window again ndash yet another flashing light Go down the stairs and go towards the central hall until you first see the metal arches Look back and note the position of the oval door you just came out of Changed position hasn rsquo t it Repeat this procedure one more time if you feel you haven rsquo t quite grasped what is going on
What rsquo s going on is that this small portion of the Peghead the chamber with the oval opening leading up to the window is rotating Every time you push the button on the round device with the arrow and move the arrow pointer you are rotating the window and looking at a different peg on the Peghead Each of these pegs with one exception where a bulb is broken can flash two identifying colors ndash one for each setting on that particular peg represented by the symbols on the round devices
Where have we seen items that display a sequence of colors Right the color posts at the Lookout
Now your job is to find out which color is associated with each symbol on the first round device you encountered and the colors associated with other round devices yet to come
Go back down to the round device with the arrow and push the button until the arrow points straight down position Come back up the stairs Go into the oval opening and look out the window Write down the color Go back out into the central hall take a left and walk back to the first entrance you went in Go back down to the round device with symbols on it and note which symbol is next to the pointer Write this symbol down and associate it with the color you just noted Now push the button on the round device you are standing in front of in order to switch the symbol Note the symbol Go back up the stairs out into the central hall and take a right Turn at the middle entrance the entrance leading to the round device with an arrow Go through the oval opening and look at the color light flashing The color has changed Note the color and associate it with the symbol you just wrote down
The semi circle symbol is associated with orange and the sideways ldquo rdquo symbol is associated with turquoise light blue
Next go downstairs and hit the button on the round device with the arrow until the arrow goes back up to where it is pointing straight up Go up the stairs and through the oval opening and note the color of the flashes Write this color down
Leave and go back into the Peghead central hallway Turn right Go into the last opening on the right farthest from the T runner and go down the stairs ndash the entrance on the right farthest from the T runner This round device has two symbols and a pointer on its face These symbols look like a rolling hill and a squarish outline of a roof
Associate the color you just wrote down with the symbol next to the pointer Push the button so that the other symbol is next to the pointer Write down the symbol Go up the stairs to the central hall and turn left Go to the middle entrance with the oval opening go up to the window and look at the color flashes Write down the color and associate it with the symbol you just wrote down
The rolling hill symbol is associated with yellow and the squarish outline of a roof symbol is associated with a pale pink
Go down to the round device with the arrow Hit the button until the arrow points to the lower left at about This will probably require pushing the button more than one time
Go up through the oval entrance and look at the flashing light Note the color Go down the stairs and out into the central hall
You are finished with the right side of the Peghead for the moment
Turn left walk forward then turn right until you can see the control device in front of the central screw Click on it and switch the power over to the left side of the device Step back until you are sitting in the T runner just to get oriented Now look to your left You are going to get out and explore the entrances to your left
Go to the left entrance closest to the T runner Go down the stairs to the round device Note the symbols one like the outline of a simple pointy roof and one like a crooked scythe Note the symbol next to the pointer Associate the symbol with the color you wrote down Hit the button so that the other symbol is next to the pointer Go upstairs cross the central hall and go into the middle entrance to the oval opening Look at the window Associate the symbol with the color
The outline of the simple pointy roof symbol is associated with green The crooked scythe symbol is also associated with green
Go back into the central hall to the device in front of the central screw Click on it to bring power to the right side of the hall Go back to the right middle entrance go down the stair and push the button until the arrow is in the left middle area of the round face at approximately This will probably take more than one push of the button
Go through the oval opening and up to the window Note the color of the flashing light
Go into the central hall to the device in front of the central screw Click on it to switch power to the left part of the Peghead Now go into the middle left entrance and go down the stairs to the round device Note the symbol next to the pointer and associate it with the color you just saw Click on the button to move the other symbol next to the pointer Write down this symbol Go back to the central hall Click on the device in front of the central screw to switch power over to the right side of the Peghead Go into the middle entrance up to the window and note the color and associate it with the symbol you just wrote down
The three sides of a rectangle symbol is associated with red The outline of a fancy pointy roof symbol can rsquo t be associated with a color ndash the bulb for the light is dead Go down the stairs to the round device with the arrow and click the button so that the arrow points to the left upper part of the round face of the device ndash approximately Go back up to the window and note the color that is flashing Go back to the central hall click on the device in front of the central screw to switch power over to the left side of the Peghead Now go to the left entrance that is farthest from the T runner Go down the stairs and note the symbol next to the pointer on the round device and associate that symbol with the color you just wrote down Push the button so that the other symbol is now next to the pointer Write down the symbol Go up the stairs go through the central hall to the middle entrance on the right Go up to the window look at the flashing light and associate it with the symbol you rsquo ve just written down
The two peaks symbol is associated with white The ldquo V rdquo symbol is associated with blue
Now look back through your notes to the color sequence you saw on the Lookout That sequence starting at the point where you entered the area and going counter clockwise was Red Green Yellow White Blue Pink purple Pink purple Turquoise
You will be arranging symbols soon in approximately this order RED three sides of a rectangle symbol
GREEN Crooked scythe symbolOR the outline of a simple pointy roof symbol
YELLOW Rolling hill symbol
WHITE Two peaks symbol
BLUE ldquo V rdquo symbol
PINK PURPLE Outline of a fancy pointy roof symbolORoutline of a squarish roof symbol
PINK PURPLE Outline of a fancy pointy roof symbolORoutline of a squarish roof symbol
TURQUOISE Sideways ldquo rdquo symbol
Adjusting the Two Symboled Motor Heads Walk out to the central hall and walk to the wall farthest from the T runner Walk around the wall to the room beyond it ndash accessible at the right corner of the wall Remember we were here earlier to record a symbol Walk to the windy area behind the wall then down the steps to a complicated machine motor with a symbol on each end of each Peghead motor head The controls are in front of you as you come down the stairs
Each button on the controls moves a motor head so that the symbol is changed You can play with this for a bit identifying symbols as you go ndash yes they are somewhat similar to the symbols from the round devices in the other part of the Peghead We need to put these in the order mentioned above The order has to be correct on the INNER circle of the motor ndash the outer circle is not important
Figure out which button operates which motor head We are looking for a symbol by which to get oriented ndash one that appears only once and is simple to identify How about two peaks Put two peaks into the center of the circle
Since we rsquo re starting with two peaks we rsquo ll reword the color sequence because we rsquo re starting where the white post was on the Lookout rather than the red one From this new starting point going counter clockwise the posts go White Blue Pink purple Pink purple Turquoise Red Green Yellow
So the symbols we rsquo ll be looking for should go counter clockwise as follows Two peaks symbol
ldquo V rdquo symbol
Outline of a fancy pointy roof symbolORoutline of a squarish roof symbol
Outline of a fancy pointy roof symbolORoutline of a squarish roof symbol
Sideways ldquo rdquo symbol
Three sides of a rectangle symbol
Crooked scythe symbolORthe outline of a simple pointy roof symbol
Rolling hill symbol
Going counter clockwise left from two peaks we rsquo d expect to see a ldquo V symbol Sure enough there is one Put that in the center of the circle The next two motorheads are problematic They are pink purple but the pink symbol ndash outline of a squarish roof ndash isn rsquo t among these two motor heads There are two symbols that look like the outline of a fancy pointed roof ndash which matched the peg whose bulb had burned out By process of elimination one of these must be pink purple So put them both into the center of the circle
Next we rsquo d expect to see a sideways ldquo rdquo symbol There is none on the next motor head that is easy to distinguish However the one symbol semi circle is CLEARLY wrong so put the ldquo V rdquo shaped symbol which at least is angular like the ldquo rdquo in the center After that the three sided rectangle YES
There clearly is a symbol for that After that either the crooked scythe symbolORthe outline of a simple pointy roof symbol
One motor head DOES look like the scythe symbol Put it in the center Last the rolling hill symbol Put that one in the center At this point you may want to save your game before pressing the center button because an animation you may want to replay is about to occur
A note from TLC Maybe I rsquo ll make the Guinness book listed under ldquo longest time ever to get through a puzzle rdquo
A note from mjartisian I think I might get that Guinness award so don rsquo t count on it
If at this point you are confused by these strange symbol descriptions here is a picture of how the motor heads should look
Press the center button
Transportation Via Egg THAT was unexpected Go around onto the balcony to the egg shaped thing facing you Enter it and push the button Going doowwwwwnnnn Where are we
Wander down the hall until you encounter the guitar sculpture Again click on it and move the curved bar on the right You rsquo ll see a video of a series of symbols from the round devices back in the Peghead Write down each symbol that is next to a pointer and the place where the arrow is pointing These are the symbols outline of a squarish roof two peaks outline of a fancy pointy roof crooked scythe semi circle arrow to lower left ndash
Head back towards the egg thing As you walk forward check to the left with every step You will see a set of stairs leading up You can go look at this area but there is nothing you actually can do or change there ndash Arin has disabled the transportation here by severing a control button so no one can get at it Maybe someone should go down there and to look and see if Juno rsquo s down there Where IS Juno
Be sure you look way up at the Peghead ndash nice view Wish we could get a better look at what rsquo s below Haven rsquo t we seen enough wonders in this game No Never enough
Final Settings for the Peghead Take the egg thing back to the top It seems the egg goes up and down the huge shaft that supports the Peghead Go up into the Peghead central hall The control device in front of the central screw is set to the left side of the Peghead so we rsquo ll start there Go to the left side entrance closest to the T runner Set the round device to the crooked scythe Go to the middle entrance on the left side Set the round device to the outline of a fancy pointy roof Go to the entrance on the left side farthest from the T runner Set the round device to two peaks Go into the central hall Click on the control device in front of the central screw Power is now on the right of the Peghead Go to the right entrance closest to the T runner Set the round device to semi circle Go to the middle entrance on the right side Set the arrow at lower left mdash approximately Go to the right entrance farthest from the T runner Set the round device to the outline of a squarish roof No trumpets sound for you but nevertheless you have now at long last tuned the Peghead
If you are interested go back to the middle entrance on the right side and go upstairs and look out the window The device is set on the broken bulb This makes sense If the guitar was usually kept in tune that particular light would be flashing a lot more than the others and would be more likely to burn out
Final Decision Final Strum Return to the T runner Take it back to the orange stone central chamber You now have a decision to make Soon you will go upstairs and perform the final action ndash strumming the guitar that is now fully prepared It is turned on correctly that is the Switch is in the correct position Adjustments have been made to eliminate feedback that is the Potentiometers are set in the correct position And the Peghead is tuned
Strumming will now create the musical key that will open the vault doors You rsquo ve pre set the green buttons on both active vault doors to the ldquo open rdquo position remember One vault holds fabulous riches The other vault holds a prisoner Which will you open Or will you open both
You can experience different endings here depending on your choices so save your game
If you wish to disable a vault door merely click on the door to get a close up and then click on one of the green buttons The light will go to red and the door will relock Even if you strum the guitar now that particular vault will stay closed
Okay a final march down the black rectangular hallway that is across from the giant fingers Go past the main vault Up the elevator to the Pickup Click to get to the controls
A note from LadyKestrel Hopefully you rsquo ll have a nice strum Take a deep breath Move the lever
Doesn rsquo t sound much different despite being tuned does it Is anything going to happen Patience ndash look at the video screen for a few more seconds
If anyone shows up to tell you a vault is open ndash congratulations You rsquo ve won the game If no one appears on the video screen after several seconds either the Potentiometers the Switch the Peghead or the green buttons on the vault door are set incorrectly and you have to go back and figure out where you went wrong
Enjoy the alternate endings By the way ndash the balcony is the orange stone one overlooking the sea ndash the place where you started the whole adventure in the first place

GAME BOOMERS hints cheats and walkthroughs
Alone In The Dark II Solution By Phil Darke Alone In The Dark is a brilliant game and much improved on the original Alone In The Dark
It is however quite hard in places but there are a couple of tricks that can make life a bit easier
First there are quite a lot of books and papers to be picked up and read while you are playing
None of these are essential in order to complete the game although they do give you an excellent background to the story
Second combat there are lots of weapons to be picked up while playing and they can be very useful but it is usually much better if you are able to fight without weapons
The head butt is particularly deadly
When you encounter one of the zombies try to get right up close to him before you attack if you can get close enough he will be unable to use his weapon and if you keep head butting and moving towards him you will kill him with no problem
It is also handy if you can get close enough to stand in a doorway to attack or to back him into some confined space thus restricting his movements
One particularly nasty individual who you will encounter is the chef who you will meet in the kitchen
He is armed with a blowpipe which is deadly and it is essential in dealing with him that you do not give him the opportunity to use it
Finally throughout the game you will pick up flasks
These are used to restore your health but don't use them unless you really need to because you should save as many as possible for the second part of the game which is much harder than the first and you need as much health as possible when you start part two
Last but not least the Adventurers Golden Rule applies in this game more than most quot SAVE EARLY SAVE OFTEN quot At the start of the game kill the first zombie and take the Thompson flask and clip which he drops
Run down the drive and shoot the zombie who runs to meet you
Now run on down to the end of the drive and kill the other three zombies who are waiting there
this is quite hard but if you use this opportunity to practice the head butt technique I mentioned above you will eventually do it though it may take several attempts
Now go back down the drive to the anchor
Push the anchor and run into the maze take the first turning left and attack the zombie there
Take the photo and return to the main path
Continue along the path and take the next right
There is another zombie here who leaves behind a rope flask and a clip for the Thompson after you have killed him
Take these there is an ace of diamonds on the ground this is the exit from the underground passage which you will be exploring shortly
Return to the main path and continue along it to the cross roads
Go left and kill the zombie there and take the book which he drops
Return to the main path and go straight across the cross roads to a T junction
turn right and then left at the end
Kill the zombie and take the clip
Now go back to the T junction and go straight across ignore the next right for the moment and carry on along the path to an alcove on the left just before the end of the path where another zombie is waiting
Kill him and continue along the path turning left at the end then left and left again at the end this takes you back to the cross roads with yet another zombie to be killed on the way
Go right at the cross roads and right at the end to where you find another zombie and also a grappling hook
There are four playing cards on the ground
Stand on the ace of diamonds to enter the underground passage the other three cards will kill you
Turn right kill the zombie and pick up the torn note book
Go to the chest and push it pick up the metallic jack card
As you do so a figure will appear behind you use the revolver to shoot it this will take about five shots
Pick up the sabre and go to the altar use the metallic jack on the altar and a trap door opens go to the ladder and climb it after taking the flask which you will find there
This is the exit mentioned earlier
Now return to the turning which you ignored earlier
Go down this passage and kill the zombie there to obtain another flask
Turn right at the end and prepare the sabre for use
walk slowly along the path until about two thirds of the way along you will be attacked by some vines
The easiest way to deal with these is to take a quick slash and step back keep repeating this until they are defeated
Save your game here and run along the path to where you find Peg Leg a particularly nasty character and quite hard to kill but if you can back him into the corner at the side of the statue and get close enough before he has chance to attack you the head butt technique works well
When you have killed him pick up the newspaper and the flask
use the rope with the grappling hook and use them on the statue
You will lose all your weapons here
BELOW THE STATUE Pick up the nickel and walk carefully across the plank which is quite slippery pick up the crank and paper bag along the way
Go to the end where you find Striker's body search the body to find a pipe cleaner and the other half of the notebook
Combine the two halves of the notebook and read it
Now go to the door and slide the newspaper under the door use the pipe cleaner on the key hole to get the key
Open the door and enter
Save your game here
Walk along to where a zombie is sleeping stand directly in front of the lever
Use the paper bag once to inflate it and again to bang it
As soon as he stands up push the lever
If you timed it right and were standing in the right place a hanging barrel will now be released which will knock him over the edge of the cliff
Pick up the book riot gun and flask and look at the side of the grandfather clock
Use the crank on the hole there and a secret passage will be revealed
Enter the passage and use the lift
BASEMENT The newspaper which you used earlier has turned into a dead mans pact
Tear this up in front of the music man he will die
Go through into the next room and pick up the battledore and go through to the next room which is the shooting gallery
Kill the two zombies her and pick up the riot gun ammunition
Now go to the end of the room to where there are four blocks
Use the battledore to turn them so that all the faces show diamonds
If you stand with your back to the blocks they turn once if you face them they turn twice
As you turn the last block a zombie appears from the door in the corner
Kill him and enter the room
Pick up the whiskey and the two books
Use the nickel on the slot machine to get two tokens
Leave this room the way you came you will encounter another zombie on the way either kill him or put the whiskey down in front of him
Take the sack and wear the Santa suit which it contains
Now return to the lift and up the stairs
GROUND FLOOR Watch the little chef zombie and the path he takes to the kitchen then follow him
If you step on the wrong squares you will get killed by the harpoon from the statue in the corner
Enter the kitchen and take and eat the fried eggs and take the frying pan
When the big chef heads towards the dumb waiter come up behind him what you are supposed to do here is kill him with the frying pan but I did not find this very effective and kill him
Now search the kitchen and take the wine and the poison
Use the poison on the wine and leave the kitchen
Go to the serving hatch and leave the poisoned wine there stand back and wait for the zombies to take the wine and die
Enter through the double doors and use the tokens on the organ
Pick up the doubloon and go through the doors at the end
Take the bullet proof vest Thompson and clip and go back the way you came
Cross the hall to the door under the stairs and turn right
This room contains four very nasty zombies and the way you are supposed to deal with them is with the hand grenade down the chimney from the floor above but I found that this did not work very well so I used the direct approach
Open the door and back out carefully position yourself in the doorway
You can probably take out the first zombie with the riot gun as he comes through the door
Then move forward and head butt the other three as they come toward you
It will probably take several attempts but it can be done
When you have seen off all four enter the room and take the red billiard ball from the Christmas tree
Now go back out and nick the crown from Neptune's head and go up the stairs
FIRST FLOOR Kill the zombie on the landing and enter the st door on the right which is the billiard room
Kill the zombie here and pick up the derringer and sword stick
Go to the bookcase at the end of the room and take the book and parchment
Leave the room and go to the bedroom
Use the sword stick on the two arms in the corner using the same technique that you used earlier with the vines
Take the parchment and use it with the other piece that you got in the billiards room and read it
Now walk to the end of the room and put the crown on the statue there
This opens up another door go through and pick up the amulet and you will be transported to the attic
THE ATTIC Pick up the message and flask and run through the door around the corner to the small chest get the Thompson and clip and kill the acrobatic zombie who attacks you
Kill the other zombie and pick up the grenade though you should not need it now flask and key
Go through the door in the corner to the end of the room
Use the doubloon on the jack in the box and take the pom pom
Now go to the other end of the room and throw the pom pom through the opening
the jumping jack will go after it and kill the snake
Now go through the opening and up to the chimney
This is where you should use the hand grenade if you did not kill the four zombies on the ground floor
Go down the chimney and back up to the st floor
Enter the billiard room again and insert the red ball into the game machine
This reveals a door at the end of the room
Use the key from the attic to open the door and enter
You are about to be captured and lose all the items in your inventory so if you have any flasks left use them now so that you have the maximum possible strength for the next part of the game
You find yourself in a cell One Eyed Jack is outside with Grace
When she makes a run for it and he chases after her
Use the hook to pick the lock and head downstairs
Elisabeth now enters through the front door and captures you again
PART TWO The action now switches to Grace
Walk down the drive towards the house avoiding the zombies turn right and go to the back of the car
Click on the boot of the car and take the red ball you find
When the car stops get out and watching the zombies by the bandstand carefully wait until the nearest zombie is looking in the other direction walk part way up the path stopping when he turn your way and continue when he turns away again
Grab the hook and quickly run off to the golf course
Put the ball in the hole and walk up to the statue which appears
Use the hook on the statue and get captured by the zombie who emerges from the hollow tree
You find yourself in the brig with Carnby
Push the boards and go through into the next room
Take the sandwich pepper and bird seed
Feed the parrot with the bird seed
The parrot now tells you where to find the captains staff
Go to the door and look out when you hear footsteps approaching and run left and hide behind the stairs
wait until the zombie passes you and stops
Run out behind him back the way you came and quickly climb the ladder
Go up the next ladder to the top deck
Make your way carefully around the outside of the deck and hide behind the barrel
run out and grab the tinder box and then go down the hatch
In the captains cabin look in the small chest and take the small cannon and the vase from the dresser and the captain's staff from the side of the bed
Put the cannon on the floor facing the door and use the pepper pot on it
Now throw the vase and use the tinder box on the cannon when the zombie opens the door
the guard will sneeze to death
Pick up the bell and go to the galley which is directly opposite the captains cabin
take the chickens foot from the table and ring the bell
Climb into the dumb waiter and go up to the kitchen
Pick up the key and open the cupboard take the molasses and the ice box
Go over to the door and use the ice box
A zombie will chase you back into the kitchen and slip and kill himself on the ice
Now head upstairs
Use the molasses on the landing to immobilise the zombie and go through the billiard room to the captain's room
Use the staff on the desk and take the key to the irons and the book
Now go into the bedroom and head for the room where Carnby found the amulet
On the floor is a square with a picture of a staff on it
Use the staff on it and it changes into a Voodoo Loa staff take this and return to the kitchen
When the zombie sees you head back to the hall he will slip on the ice
Return to the kitchen and ring the bell climb into the dumb waiter and return to the ship where you will get captured again
THE BRIG The action now switches to Carnby again
Pick up the key by moving the cursor keys down until you can reach them
Unlock the irons and attack the zombie
Pick up the sword which he drops and enter the next room
Kill the zombie here and walk out into the passage
Kill the zombie here and pick up the short fuse and pistol which he drops
Now enter the door opposite the forge here are another two zombies to be killed

Throw the bottle and take the message and read it
Now go down to the room at the end of the corridor
Kill the zombie and take the ammunition flask and pistol
Leave this room and head back toward the door where you entered the passage and climb the ladder opposite
On the way you will encounter a particularly hard zombie but if you are quick enough you can run up and climb the ladder before he attacks you
He will not follow you and since you do not need to return here again it does not matter
MIDDLE DECK Go into the room with the cannon and kill the sleeping zombie
Take the ammunition which he drops and go and use the pliers on the chain attaching the cannon to the wall
Push the cannon so that it faces the opposite way and use the short fuse on it
Now go to the door opposite and open it
This is the crew's sleeping quarters
Drop the powder keg just inside the door and return to the cannon
Use the poker on the fuse
The powder keg explodes and kills all the crew inside the sleeping quarters
Enter the sleeping quarters and pick up the flask and bag of gold coins
Go to the door and use the bag of coins this will attract the attention of the two little chef zombies in the galley opposite
Kill them and go into the galley
Pick up the flask and head for the store room
Here you will encounter the big chef with the blowpipe he is very difficult to kill but he way I did it was to enter the door and back out then quickly manoeuvre into the corner to the left of the door
From here he can't get you with the blowpipe but you will still be able to hack at him with the sword
when you have killed him pick up the metallic Jack Of Diamonds which he drops
Use this to enter the captains cabin which is opposite the galley
THE CAPTAINS CABIN The action now switches to Grace

THE TOP DECK Don't even try to kill the big zombie you can't
just head up the ladder to the top deck as fast as possible
Kill the music man and grab his hook
Kill the other zombies and climb the mast
To kill the zombie here attack him and try to force him off the edge of the platform
Use the hook to slide down the rope and attack the acrobatic zombie here but be careful not to fall off the mast
Quickly grab the sword from the deck this is Captain Nicolas's sword
Run to the mast and use the pliers to release Grace
Now run to the cannon which is pointing at the mast and grab the fuse this will preventing it from firing
Now attack One Eyed Jack with Captain Nicholas's sword
He is very hard to kill but if you allow him to back you into the gap between the rail and the box on the other end of the deck and keep hacking at him you should eventually be able to kill him
You and Grace now jump into the lifeboat and escape

Well when you've killed him you got to use the hook on the rope to slide on to the other mast
There's a man standing at the end of the mast
Save
Kill him
Then jump out from the mast but do it at the middle of the mast or you won't land on the deck
When you land at the deck pick up the captains sword in the bottom of the screen
Then the captain is coming to kill you
Now here you can do two things you can die when the ship explodes or you can live to complete the game
I think you should try both of the sequences it's quite fun really
I've written both of'em up below so try both though the last one is the real solution and the one I've included the end save game also Ship Explodes Don't free the but use the captain's weapon to kill him when he comes after you
He won't die but he will explode the ship and you are dead
Pretty cool action sequence though The End The girl is tied up at the mast go free her with the tenailles
Then go down to the end of the ship and pick up the fuse from the cannon
Then kill the captain with his own sword spooky huh
Then the ship will explode but you won't be on it
The house will disappear as you sail away into the moonlight GAME BOOMERS hints cheats and walkthroughs

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
Note It is to be pointed out at the outset that these notes and the walkthrough are based on playingAlicein the easiest of the four levels of difficulty offered however it should serve as a basis for the more difficult ones
American McGee rsquo s Alice Observations Comments amp Walkthrough By Soren Andersen ldquo This is an all new Alice adventure and can be considered a third chapter in her story
It takes place after Alice rsquo s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass and although it features many characters and places from those stories things have definitely taken a turn for the worst in Alice rsquo s childhood dreamland rdquo The foregoing is a quote that I found somewhere
There are a lot of things that are unique about this game different from most Adventure games
Actually it is really a Role Playing Game which is a very close relative of Adventure games or perhaps it may be considered an Action game
The dynamic graphics are exceptional with much detail and continuously adjustable perspective
There are whimsical quirks thrown in just one example of many beingAlice rsquo s breath becoming visible in an icy scenario
EA Games has provided much supplemental information for and about this game
Go to START gt Programs gt EA GAMES gt American McGee rsquo sAlice gt Gameplay Help for an Internet help supplement in the header will be found several categories on which to click for expansion
In addition if in the above Start series you choose Web Resources instead of Gameplay Help you will have the opportunity to access the game rsquo s home page where under the Wonderland choice you will find descriptions and illustrations of characters you will meet and maps with none too accurate florid words concerning many locations including animated sketches
I strongly advise you to carefully peruse these two help items at the outset of gameplay and in addition I suggest that you print the entire Gameplay Help for ready reference while playing
Interfacing with the game action takes some getting used to for the Adventure gamer
The keyboard and the mouse are employed simultaneously including both mouse buttons
Learning to use the four movement keys without looking for them would be a big advantage
The many controls actions and options are thoroughly covered in pages of the Gameplay Guide booklet and also the Internet Gameplay Help reference above However I think there are a couple features that that could bear more emphasis when Alice is on a rope or a vine the default Enter key will cause her to climb up and the F key will do the reverse When the rotating jump footprints appear pressing the jump key will cause Alice to jump to that location however if a movement key is pressed at the same time as the jump key the footprints are ignored and the distance she jumps is dependent on how long the movement key is held down
It is not necessary for the footprints to be showing for her to jump
Saved games are limited in number only by available storage they are saved in folder C Program Files EA GAMES American McGee rsquo s Alice Base Save If you look at this folder you will find that it takes files for each saved game a total of about MB for each save
The files with the tga extension are the thumbnails that you see in the stored games display when playing and if you have an appropriate graphics display program I had Microsoft Picture It
that came with Windows XP they can be used to identify the particular file in the many saved ones
There is no inventory as such the few items that Alice acquires other than weapons she carries invisibly and are automatically used when appropriate usually in a video The Cheshire Cat can be summoned for a comment by the use of the keyboard C key but I found his remarks are usually too enigmatic or irrelevant to be of any value There is more whimsy when Alice is left idle for a bit she indulges in two or three tricks with whatever weapon she is currently holding to pass the time until action resumes
As the game progressesAlice gathers a series of weapons also referred to as toys to use against the innumerable enemy attacks upon her
There are ten of these weapons and very generally they are more powerful the later they are found
After acquisition they are selected for use by the keyboard numeric keys and used closeup by the left mouse button primary attack and at a distance by the right button secondary or alternate attack
The one in effect is indicated by the icon flag at the base of the red meter column on the left
Be sure and note the targeting indicators on the enemy for the different units
She must have Will mdash the blue column at screen right mdash to use these weapons the exception being the knife the first one acquired and the more powerful the weapon the more Will is used up when it is employed as reflected in the height of the blue Will meter
Will builds up again but slowly it takes a minute and a half for the meter to fill itself after it has been completely emptied
If her Will is too low when she fights an enemy her weapon reverts to the knife since that requires none
There are small and large Sanities floating about that Alice can acquire as well as many metas of different strengths all of which help replenish Will in incremental amounts
Some of the weapons are found more than once and should be picked up each time because in theory that adds to their power
The only direct evidence of this is with the Demon Dice in which case an additional die is added to the signature flag at the bottom of the Sanity meter and indicates an additional demon You must be careful about using some of the more powerful of the weapons inAlice rsquo s arsenal
As warned by the Cheshire Cat do not employ the Demon Dice when alone as the demon may well attackAliceif it cannot find anything else
When she tosses the Jackbomb it may not go where intended and the fires thrown out by an exploding bomb can consume her if they get too close When the Jabberwock's Eye Staff is complete the way to use it is to hold down the left mouse button and after a short delay a beam will emanate from it as long as the button is held down
Keep the beam trained on the enemy but note that as you do this that the Will meter is draining
It is not clear whether there is a Jabberwock rsquo s Eye Staff secondary attack using the right mouse button
The meter that appears as a red column on the left of the screen is called the Sanity meter
AsAlice takes hits during enemy attacks the red level lowers and if it becomes completely empty Alice is done for
When she takes out an enemy a Sanity meta appears above its remains and she can use it to replenish the meter generally it is of a higher order that if not gathered within a short period degenerates to a lower value and then if still not gathered soon it may vanish
There is a faint whoosh when this happens
There are many other metas floating around Wonderland to be gathered as needed
Alice will encounter about twenty five different types of enemies and like the weapons they are more powerful the later they appear for the first time in the game progression
At intervals there are a half dozen with which Alice must undertake a sustained running battle and these present a particularly difficult challenge
Which weapon to use against a particular enemy depends not only on the latter rsquo s response to the weapon but also on the dexterity and personal preference of the player as well as the situation encountered
I suggest recalling a saved game and then trying a different weapon
I myself found that the primary attack of the Ice Wand to be the best in general secondary attack almost never employed
As it happens I did not use the Dead Time Watch very much which is reflected in the walkthrough but there are several situations in which it could profitably be brought into play
It is important to realize and remember that Alice will be set upon by a variety enemies almost continuously as she journeys through Wonderland and you mustbe alert at all times for attacks the only ones that gives any real warning are the flying beetles which sound like helicopters and get louder as they approach
There are four items called Powerups that appear infrequently and for me were of little use
For one thing their effectiveness lasts only about seconds and they are not necessary for gameplay
The Darkened Looking Glass is valuable once and the Deadtime Watch mdash which seems to be considered a Powerup as well as a weapon having flags on both meters very helpful once
Others may find these items more useful
Alice rsquo s default movement is running with walking achieved by simultaneously pressing both the default W and shift keys this may be reversed in the Options menu by clearing the X in the Always Run entry
There are a few instances in which having her run is mandatory but considering how much of the time her progress is rather delicate I usually chose the always walk option rather than having to press two keys at once so much of the time
Up to you
The mode may be changed at any time except during cutscenes by setting or clearing the X
Also to be considered there are times when fighting enemies may be avoided simply by running past them though they may catch up to her Aliceis swift and indefatigable
Sometimes when going from venue to venue particularly when going through a portal there is a reasonably relevant location on the other side at other times this device is used to transportAlice to a situation that is an abrupt change from that which she left
Something to accept Also to be accepted is that the names of the venues very frequently have no relevance to the venue content these names are the ones displayed on the stored games display page
There are cheats for this game that are not like any other I have encountered and lend a new meaning to the term
You can alter many of the game responses in a way that eliminates challenges and I guess you could use them if you become really desperate such as the running battles
I have supplied an attachment that details a selected few of them there are more but I don rsquo t think they are particularly relevant
I think this is a very difficult game indeed even in the Easy mode that I chose to play Alice has innumerable opportunities to perish so whenever she was in a tricky or dangerous situation I would employ the common technique of saving the game so that when something dire happened I could restore and try again
Then when I had got her past the crisis and reasonably advanced I would delete interim stored games keeping only those that I deemed important so that I did not accumulate an unreasonably large set of stored games but even so the number of retained saves in this game that is so full of hazards approaches an astonishing
The game in fact facilitates this technique by automatically setting up a return to the last saved game prior to Alice perishing
The Readme indicates that this game will play on several versions of Windows Windows XP is not mentioned
However that is what I used and it installed and played with no problems at all
There is a lot of gaming on just two disks
The following walkthrough was developed from the game as I played it and I must re emphasize that of the choice of four degrees of play difficulty offered the player at the initial launch I chose the least of these Easy which I found to be difficult enough for me
Please keep this selection in mind if you consult the walkthrough as greater degrees of difficulty may not exactly fit the described action at certain times or situations
The concluding scenarios of this game are pretty far out even for a computer video game but after all that is what it is
Soren Andersen December WALKTHROUGH The game begins with a video from which it may be gathered thatAlicewas the only survivor of a disastrous fire and the resulting emotional trauma has landed her in an asylum of some sort wherein her dreams imagination or hallucinations have taken her back again to a very different Wonderland
As in the past she falls down a hole where she finds the White Rabbit who tells her they are very late and not to dawdle then scampers off
The Cheshire Cat appears and tells her to follow the knowledgeable Rabbit
As she moves off to do this she enters a mine where on the walls is crude machinery that does nothing but move
She meets a despondent troll miner then to continue has to float across a broken plank bridge on some vapor bubbles
Another miner tells her to beware the Queen of Hearts Aliceis defiant
Down the mine passage can be seen a Small Meta that Alice can use to fill her Sanity meter after which she can acquire her first weapon the Vorpal Blade knife
Alice sees the White Rabbit shrink and disappear into a small hole
She tells another miner she wants to become quite small and he informs her that she must go to the Fortress of Doors to find out how to do that
As she continues on she encounters her first enemy a Club Card Guard which she can readily dispatch with the knife either by throwing it right mouse key or waiting for him to come close then slashing left mouse key
Continuing on around a corner near the hole into which the Rabbit went she enters another mine area where the Cheshire Cat appears on a ledge below three animated smoking pipes
Jump and climb to this ledge then go up more planks to yet another miner who can't tell her how to get to the Fortress of Doors but says that deeper in the mine there is one who can
Up more planks and across a platform is a sign that says Yur Mine and Alice must jump to the floor just below it being careful not to bounce off the wall and miss after which she goes on to a new venue
Alice now has her first encounter with a hanging green rope which she must here use to cross a slime hazard
Employ the forward and jump keys to get her near the rope release them so she grasps it use the forward and back keys to get her swinging in ever increasing arcs then when she is near the far platform press the jump key again to get her to release the rope and land on the platform
Actually Alice can jump across but the learning experience with the rope is worthwhile
Go down the planks and over to the Troll Elder
In a cutscene he states that he can make her small in return for a key that she must get for him from the Card Guards quarters
Proceed along the mine corridor around a corner and upward to where a video hasAlice get onto a mine cart and ride down a long rickety track at the end of which the cart crashes far below
Fortunately Alicegot off onto a platform before the cart went over the edge but she is immediately attacked by a Card Guard whom she can dispatch if she turns and acts quickly
In the distance is seen another weapon for her to pick up the Card Deck
After getting it and backing up a little she is in front of a large wooden door that is the entrance to the Card Guards quarters
Through this door then another and up some curving stairs she can see the key that she needs glistening at the far end of the room
Defeating some guards or running she can get the key then go up stairs on the left to a swirling portal that looks like a cosmic galaxy
Passing through the portal she is back in the same area where she entered this venue
There is a quick cutscene of the Troll Elder in front of another portal beckoning
Two Card Guards are shooting cards at her from a distance
Go around the corner to the left and take care of the Guard there and continue so that the building shields her from one of the distant Guards
Move forward a little toward the Guard that can be seen up on the platform from which she jumped to the rope eliminate him with a secondary knife attack then do the same to the other Guard
With danger goneAlice can move forward and either jump or swing to the platform where she landed after her first rope swing then pass the through the portal where the Elder was beckoning
He is waiting for her on the other side in a Troll powered airship and in a long video he takes her to the Fortress of Doors telling her on the way that there is a skool in the Fortress where she will find the items needed for a concoction that will make her small
He leaves her on a ledge outside the Fortress wall
A short distance ahead is a break in the Fortress wall that letsAliceenter a courtyard with a slowly oscillating building in it
Proceed over some blocks to a gate in the wall on the right
In the gallery inside deal with the Boojum secondary knife then go into the large roofless room and head for the stairway on the far side
When she gets to the center of this room it slides apart but there is a long floorboard on the right from which she can jump across the gap and continue to the stairway
Go up the stairs and cross the balcony
On the other balcony above the entrance gate can be seen a slowly rotating portal and in front ofAliceis a Z shaped walkway leading to that balcony
Jump to this walkway which slowly sinks due to her weight while the other end rises
If she walks along the walkway when she gets to the other end it will have sunk and she will be unable to jump to the portal balcony therefore what she must do is run along the walkway so that when she gets to the end it is still high enough so that she will be able to make the leap to the portal balcony
Go through the portal to another venue
Emerging from the portalAlice is at the entrance of a high walled simple maze in which there are a number of Card Guards for which she must be ready
Move ahead and as she does go to the right and then to the left and she will be at a low pedestal on which there is a Ragebox
It may be ignored
Move to the left of the pedestal then straight ahead into the corridor
In it go right and the maze exit door will be seen
There are in fact four doors
Exiting the lastAlice will be in a maelstrom where in the distance can be seen a portal in a ruin
Have her make her way to this portal and when she goes through it she will be in a very similar scene but where there was a portal there now is a door should she go to this door she would find that it will not open
In front of her is a lever in the floor and when she pulls it there is a brief cutscene of three doors closing each one with a musical tone and the sequence of the tones must be noted low high and middle
Once again should she try the distant door it will still not open
Go down a stairway that is on the left
At the bottom is a row of three floor levers that are to be pulled so that the door closing tone sequence is reproduced low being on the right
This action is the key to unlocking the distant door and the ones behind it as shown in the cutscene if the levers are pulled correctly
Return up the stairs cross the ever lengthening pathway and proceed through the door
Here another cutscene shows a room with a tiled floor that beaks up then the sections continually rise and fall Alice must jump from section to section so that she progresses to the top of the far end of the room
Just use the jump footprints and in short order she will be ready to make the final leap to the platform where through the open door may be seen yet another portal
This portal takesAlice back to the maze but now she is on the top of the maze walls with the pedestal where the Ragebox was going up and down
There are three piers in front of her with a door on the center one
It opens briefly to display a portal evolves into three doors that bound from pier to pier for a bit then settle down so there is a door on each pier
She must approach a door hoping it will open to show the portal and that she can go through it before the door closes
She will eventually succeed and will be back at the Fortress of Doors looking at the top of the surrounding wall From her position on the wallAlice can see the slowly oscillating building that she saw in the courtyard when she first came through the Fortress wall
This is the skool that on the balloon trip the Troll Elder said contained the items needed to make the get small potion
Go along the wall to the opposite side and in the building she will see an open window
Climb up on edge of the wall and jump through the window
The room in which Alice lands when jumping from the Fortress wall offers the first exposure to the Insane Children whose sole function seems to be making annoying sounds and getting in the way though later it will be found that the Mad Hatter uses them as fodder to produce his Clockwork Automatons
Move directly through this room and Alice will emerge in the main hall of the skool
She will encounter a multitude of Card Guards throughout her experiences in the skool
The first thing to do is to acquire the new weapon on the small balcony on the left
Go up the stairs and move along the main balcony toward the smaller one
She can jump to the fireplace mantel and from there to the weapon the Croquet Mallet
Jump down to the main floor and go through the doors underneath the weapon balcony
Alice has entered the skool auditorium
A video shows her joining the Elder for a conversation down by the auditorium stage
He states that the potion recipe is to be found in the Book of Bizarre Things that is in the skool library
Two Card Guards come running down the aisles to attack after Alice takes them out her new weapon
leave the auditorium and go back to the main room where another video shows the Troll Elder in the library entrance moving a wall of books so as to give access to the main library
This entrance is at the top of the stairs and is the only accessible set of doors on the balcony
Follow the book lined hallways to the bottom floor of the main part of the library which is a huge four floored atrium
Go to the center and turn left where in an alcove will be found the first of four Blue Books
WhenAlicemoves to it it flies away but this is not the last of it
Return to where she entered this atrium where may be found a platform at the base of a column with spiral markings
Get on the platform which is an elevator that will take her to the second floor
When she gets off a cutscene shows the Cheshire Cat tilting a vertical bookcase to make a ramp to the next floor remarkably the same thing happens to a bookcase across the atrium
Turn left to see the second of the Blue Books and it too flies away when she approaches it
Go up the bookcase ramp the Cat produced and turn left at the top
At the end of the floor is a large red panel over which is a sign that says OBSERVATORY Alicecan rsquo t get in at this time but its location is now known
Turn around and follow the perimeter of this floor all the way around until she is across the atrium from the Observatory and in front of a large elevator
On the way around the two Blue Books will be seen hovering above and she will also encounter a third one and send it flying
Get in the elevator which takes her up one floor where in front of her is a fourth Blue Book
As she gets to it a cutscene shows it joining the other three at the far end of the atrium
Go there and jump from book to book to a large volume in an alcove
This is the Book of Bizarre Things
Go over or around the book
In a cutscene the Cat appears andAlicetells him the book won't open he suggests that she give it a tap whereupon she pushes it off its base to fall to the first floor far below
The Blue Books have rearranged themselves so thatAlicecan use two of them to get to the next floor below where she can take the bookcase ramp down to the second floor and from which she can jump down to the Bizarre Things Book
The latter has conveniently fallen open to the desired recipe MUSHROOMS POPPIES SUGAR AND SPICE ALL THOSE THINGS ARE VERY NICE WHEN COMBINED THE PROPER MIXTURE MAKES A GETTING SMALL ELIXER After she has read it she is transported to a new venue
The game fades her to the entrance of a new room in the skool one that is circular in shape and with a large dark pillar in the center off to the right are double doors with pink heart shaped lights on either side and to the left are identical doors with white lights
Proceed through the doors on the left where the Demon Dice weapon may be seen down and to the left on a room fragment floating in space
Go down the stairs and to the edge of the broken floor where the idea is to jump to and gather the dice jump back and continue the game
However this is not easily done because of the Boojum that appears immediately after the dice are acquired and which can blowAlice off the platform into the void below
Here is one way to success haveAlice jump to the right of the dice so that she does not pick them up then turn back to face to the right of the stairs
Strafe to the right to get the dice whereupon there is a comment from the Cheshire Cat that should be kept in mind
When the acquisition video fades Alice will be holding the dice immediately press the keyboard key so that she will have a weapon to engage the Boojum that is right there
Having done this she should be able to dispatch it then jump back and return up the stairs to the circular room
Cross the room and enter the doors between the pink lights
Above these doors is a sign that says STGRAYD and beyond them is a hallway with two more doors either of which opens to a large room that is a gymnasium
Off of a stage to the left is a small room with a lever in the floor and whenAlicemoves this lever a cutscene shows bleachers extending from a side of the gym and the Troll Elder beckoning from the rafters in one corner of the room
Go to the left end of the top of the bleachers where she can jump to a rafter then to another and make her way to the Troll Elder hurrying past the swinging lamps to avoiding being knocked off the rafters
When she gets to him there is a cutscene in which he says that he has one of the ingredients of the getting small recipe and he shows Alice a mushroom
At the conclusion of this video be prepared for a serious Boojum attack which is best handled from the gym floor so jump down to do so
Return to the circular room and climb the stairs around the pillar to the second floor balcony
Here there is only one door that is not boarded up or wildly swinging so go to that one
Above it there is a sign that says NDGRAYD
WhenAlice goes through the hall she will enter the skool laboratory with some apparatus bubbling on a table
The Troll Elder is being attacked by card guards so she must save him
A cutscene ensues in which the elder says he has sugar spice drops and now all that rsquo s needed is poppy seed whichAlice must get
For reasons not yet revealed to do this she must have some Jumbo Grow which the elder points out is in a nearby cupboard
Go over to the cupboard and get the flask of Jumbo Grow then leave the lab
In the hall there are doors on either side it doesn rsquo t matter which are chosen to go through because the results will be the same
She will enter a hall identical to the one just left except that the sign above one of the end doors says RDGRAYD
Go through this door
On the opposite wall from the room doors thatAlice just entered is another set through which she must pass but before she does get another Croquet Mallet that is off to the left
At the far side of the final room is a large planter in which is a sign that says POPPY SEEDS
Approach the planter and the Jumbo Grow will appear and empty onto a glowing area whereupon a lollipop will grow out of it
This is evidently the poppies lollipoppies
of the Book of Bizarre Things recipe climb onto the planter to acquire it
NowAlice must go back to the NDGRAYD laboratory where the Troll Elder is waiting to make the getting small potion
In a video he waves his arms at the apparatus and a vial of potion labeled Drink Me appears next to it
The elder is holding a shiny gold star and he tellsAliceit is for her
He says she must now leave the skool by way of the Observatory then disappears leaving the star behind
Pick up both the star and the potion
When she turns to leave she finds that there is a portal in the doorway
Go through it
Alice emerges from the portal through the previously locked door under the stairway in the skool main room
Go up the stairway to the door to the library on the right through the hall to the unenclosed platform elevator and up to the second floor
Go left and go up the tilted bookcase ramp to the third floor then left to the Observatory
Since she has the star from the Troll Elder the Observatory doors will open and upon going through them she is in a rising elevator
When the elevator stops leave it to enter the Observatory
There is a large sphere in the center of the room and on a balcony a telescope pointed at it
Go around the sphere and up the broken stairs to the balcony where the sphere can be seen to be a geographic globe
Look through the telescope to initiate a video in which the globe opens to reveal another portal Alicedrinks the get small potion and flies through the portal to the Vale of Tears
In this new exterior venue Alice has achieved her goal of becoming very small rdquo about the size of a mouse rdquo and her enemies for the time being change from Cards and Boojums to flowers ants and flying beetles
She now faces a high cliff down which cascades a waterfall and she must make her way to the top
The White Rabbit can be briefly seen near the top of the cliff before he disappears into a crevice as an ant soldier pushes a boulder down sealing off the entrance Go over to the signpost on the left from whereAlice can jump across the ravine to the path at the base of the cliff to begin her ascent
She must do much jumping and climbing from rock to rock as she goes back and forth along segments of path across the cliff face moving ever upward
On two occasions an ant soldier rolls a boulder down the path which will destroy her if she does not avoid it in the case of the first one she can go behind the nearby waterfall and when the second one is seen all that has to be done is stop and wait for it to fall away before it gets to her
The flying beetles that show up can be ignored or she can gain experience knocking them out of the air for a long while in the game there will be many more dropping acorn bombs on her
At the top of the cliff she will encounter a couple ant soldiers but she has weapons to easily disposed of them
From the waterfall crest travel upstream along the path next to the stream jumping across it as necessary
SoonAlice will meet the Mock Turtle next to a pool and in a video he tells her that the Duchess has taken his shell and ifAlicegets it back for him he will lead her to the White Rabbit and thus the Caterpillar whom she must find in her quest to save Wonderland
He then jumps on a leaf floating in the pool and sails off down a branch of the stream
Another leaf falls onto the pool surface andAlicemust use it to follow the Turtle
Jump on the waiting leaf which then starts downstream passing over a small waterfall onto more rapidly moving water then another small waterfall and into another pool
Here the leaf turns and passes under a large overhanging root that can brushAlice into the water Snark attack so before this can happen she must jump from the leaf to the root
Ignore the flying beetles
If she is adept she can jump back onto the leaf after it passes under the branch otherwise she must get onto another of the endlessly passing leaves
The leaf takesAlice over another small waterfall where she sees the Mock Turtle ahead of her then over a large waterfall where she falls into the stream
Immediately go left and jump out onto the bank before the Snarks arrive
Walk along the bank and dispatch two ant soldiers then jump from lilypad to lilypad to the waiting leaf which starts downstream
Right after emerging from the spray of a waterfall there will be another root that she must jump over or be brushed into the water or else jump on and wait for another leaf which will carry her onward through a hollow log
Keep her positioned near the center of the leaf as she continues on until another root hanging down is seen move to the right until past it
In due time she will come to a waterfall that will cause her to perish if she goes over a helpful warning sign that she is approaching it is some thorns from a Pink Rose shooting by
Just before reaching the falls the leaf carries her close to the right bank where there is a streamside ledge to which she must jump from the leaf
Go up and around a large rock to see the leaf waiting in the stream below at the base of the falls
Go down to the leaf and continue downstream where there is yet another group of roots waiting to push her into the water jump onto it
HereAlice will be subject to a serious flying beetle attack so she must be prepared to deal with it or they will bomb her into the water
As soon as possible have her jump onto a leaf
As she goes downstream toward another fatal waterfall the Mock Turtle will be seen crossing a bridge
Almost immediately after that she will be at the brink of this dangerous falls where she must look for a hanging vine to grasp or a rock on the left to which to jump the latter is perhaps easier
If she goes to the rock jump and climb to be near the bridge that the Turtle crossed if she grabs the vine climb it a little then swing to this area
Do not bother to cross the bridge on the left it leads to a dead end
Instead follow the path away from the bridge climb up a ledge and continue upward to another pool
KeepAlice close to the right hand wall of rocks and she will get a glimpse of the Mock Turtle
When she gets to the pool a leaf will fall onto it jump on and it will start down stream
Keep Alice near the center so some mushrooms will not knock her off
She will go over a waterfall and into the next venue however if she does get knocked off the leaf she can swim to and go over the waterfall
When gameplay resumes afterAlice has gone over the waterfall she has somehow rescued herself and is on a path next to the stream where she has a long walk ahead of her
On the way she must dispatch a pair of ant soldiers and another pair when she gets to the end of the path at a calm lake where there are two lilypads moving slowly back and forth
Beware of this calm water in it dwells a very large fish that will end the game by swallowing Alice in one gulp if she falls in and stays too long in the water
Jump from lilypad to lilypad to a black rock if flying beetles are heard coming Alice must get ready to dispose of them as they approach because they can bomb her off the lilypads into the water and the waiting voracious fish
Jump to the rock when the pad swings close to it
From there go along the path skirting the lake until stopped then jump down to a root protruding over the lake and onto another of those conveniently waiting leaves
Be ready to strafe because there are three opportunities for Alice to be brushed into the water as the leaf sails along
When it stops leap to the path on the shore
Move along the path using a lilypad to get around a rock until it ends below a slope where there is a Hart Meta next to an evil mushroom the first of many that will be encountered with several ant soldiers in the background
These lsquo shrooms are best avoided because once drawn to them it is difficult to escape however one can try by simultaneously moving backward and strafing or jumping
They can also attack by emitting a green toxic mist but if they do that they are then vulnerable to your weapons
Go up the slope toward the large white tree on the left you can get past the lsquo shroom by staying close to it
Eliminate the ant soldiers and the Pink Rose that pops up then move along and take care of the second set of soldiers
Keep going to meet another Pink Rose and possibly a flying beetle then go to the shore and another waiting leaf
There two of these jump to the one on the left
The trip on this leaf will be very short
Ignore the flying beetles and look around for torches on shore then use a couple of lilypads to get to them eliminate the ant soldiers and go up the path to the house
Here will be a creature that is most likely a lizard and in a cutscene states that he is Bill McGill and that this is the Duchess rsquo s house
Follow him to be drawn into the house and the next venue
This venue is just one big fight with the Duchess to keep her from eatingAlice and when this creature is destroyed Alicewill get the Mock Turtle rsquo s shell for him
It will not be easy to best the Duchess because she is a formidable foe continually attacking with her big teeth and virulent clouds of pepper
From the house entrance move Alice along the corridor into which she has been sucked by following Bill McGill and she will arrive at the arena where the confrontation will take place
For convenience Alice should be in the always run mode in this venue
Around the sides of this large room are several metas that can be used to regenerate the red Sanity meter as hits are taken from the Duchess and on a table in the center of the room is a new weapon a Jackbomb
Go to the table and jump up to acquire it
The Jackbomb is a pretty fearsome weapon if one learns how to use it
The left mouse key primary attack causes Alice to toss the bomb ahead of her a short distance where after a delay that allows her to move out of range it explodes presumably destroying any enemy nearby but maybe not depending on the enemy the right mouse key alternate attack explosion is delayed longer but the explosion throws out fiery streams in several directions that persist for a while consuming anyone they touch or who runs into them and this includes Alice
After she tosses it there is a delay until it appears in her hand to be used again
As soon as the Jackbomb is acquired the Duchess appears from the fireplace and comments are exchanged in a video at the conclusion of which the battle begins
The best weapon is the new Jackbomb trying to toss it to a location where the Duchess is expected to be andAlice will not when it goes off
Before being successful there will probably be much running around the room recharging the Sanity meter from the several metas
Keep Alice trying
There is one ploy thatAlice can try she can get on the fireplace mantle where she will be safe from the Duchess and attack her from there as long as the latter remains close by
However if the Duchess moves away she can use her pepper clouds on Alice from a distance
When the bomb does the Duchess in she literally sneezes the top of her head off
This brings up a cutscene in which a panel in the room wall swings open and Bill McGill and the Mock Turtle enter
The Turtle gets his shell and to keep his bargain withAlice to find the White Rabbit says she must now swim behind him following his trail of bubbles as an air supply
McGill opens the table top and the Turtle and Alice jump to the next venue
In this venue allAlice does is follow the Mock Turtle in a long underground swim staying in his stream of trailing bubbles as a source of air
As might be expected this is not as easy as it sounds
There are many impediments in this watery scenario that she must maneuver around as she pursues his erratic path killer slabs that fall from above Snarks and another voracious fish that can swallow Alice in one gulp
It is easy to lose the Turtle and difficult to find him again
Hold down the forward movement key and be very nimble with the mouse until she finally reaches the exit opening in the cavern roof
Alice flies out of a pool after the long underwater swim following the Mock Turtle and lands on a path next to the pool
A cutscene follows in which the Turtle appears talks to Alice and makes her an honorary reptile she is shown briefly wearing a turtle shell so it should be amphibian not reptile and he then swims away
As an honorary amphibian she can stay under water longer without having to surface to breathe
MoveAlice along the path between some large rocks where she encounters an ant soldier
Flying beetles are heard all the time so be on continual alert for them
Advance to another pool in which there are lily pads
Leap pad to pad to a hanging vine
Climb the vine and swing to a path on a ledge
Proceed along the path toward the waterfall encountering a Pink Rose on the way
Go behind the waterfall and keep going along the path until it ends next to a Bounce Mushroom growing from the cliff wall out over the stream also over the stream is a hanging vine
Face the vine strafe jump left to the Mushroom and bounce to the vine
Swing to a path where the White Rabbit is waiting
A cutscene ensues in which the Rabbit says they must find the all knowing Caterpillar then he runs away down the path
Follow the Rabbit to a cliff edge where two fungi can be seen on the far wall
Jump to the fungi from the second one jump to another hanging vine and then swing to a path below a big tree branch
Proceed along the path encountering another Pink Rose
Flying beetles can still be heard expect an attack
Keep going encountering another Pink Rose and flying beetles
If necessary a Heart Meta is available by climbing a couple of fungi
The path takesAlice to the edge of a deep abyss in which can be seen four Bounce Mushrooms two hanging vines and a ledge below on the left
Jump to the ledge walk to the first vine and get rid of the ant soldier on the ledge across the way
Alice can get to that ledge by swinging vine to vine or by jumping to the Mushrooms and using the movement keys
From the ledge go through the arch in the base of a very large and tall tree stump into its hollow center
Here she will find two small Sanities floating above a rock a Bounce Mushroom growing from the stump wall and high up two fungi from one of which hangs a vine
Go up on the rock past the Sanities and jump to the vine
Climb the vine to the height of the Mushroom back off so that she is looking down and start swinging
Let go when near the Mushroom and if everything has been gauged correctly Alicewill bounce up between the fungi to a ledge near the top of the stump
Move along the ledge to the deep notch in the stump
She can see another ledge far down mdash don rsquo t have Alice jump to that as the distance is too great and she will perish
Try to jump to the top of the stump to the right of the notch she won rsquo t make it but will fall to an opening in the stump wall a short way down
An alternative is to manipulate the mouse and the movement keys afterAlicebounces off the Mushroom so that she lands on the fungus from which the vine is suspended
From there she can jump to the opening in the stump wall
Be on the immediate lookout for an ant general and take him out right away
Proceed beyond the opening in the stump wall down a quite long path watching and listening for flying beetles untilAlice comes to a narrow rock bridge which an earthquake causes to crumble and fall away just as she approaches it
Jump to the near Bounce Mushroom which will pass her to the other one and back up to the path beyond the collapsed bridge
Keep going along the path until she gets to a vine that she can use to get to a fungus growing from the rock wall and where there is another vine
Jump to this vine climb to near the top and swing to the nearby path
Move along this path watching for flying beetles until it ends at the river where three flat rocks are to be found in the water
In the distance can just be seen a Pink Rose that will attack whenAlice jumps to the nearest flat rock but it easily vanquished since she knows it is there
Jump back to the river bank on the right then to the two flat rocks ahead
Jump to the path along the river to the left which will take her into a cave that leads to the next venue
Immediately after exiting the tunnel from the Dry Landing venue there is a series of cutscenes in which the White Rabbit tellsAlice that the Caterpillar is nearby it isn rsquo t and they should hurry to him then he scampers off leaving her to follow
A pair of legs with very large feet appears and stomps the Rabbit flat Aliceis discouraged and remorseful then the Cheshire Cat appears and tells her to get on with it as she must find the Caterpillar
Gameplay resumes withAlice in a level area next to the flattened White Rabbit
There are three exits from this area one leads back to the cave from Dry Landing the one ahead goes between hills on which is a very large mushroom on the left and a yellow flower and two metas on the right and off to the right rear past a nearby meta is an exit that goes under an arch made of two very large stones
Should Alice decide to return to Dry Landing she will find that the cave has somehow become blocked so she can rsquo t go back
There are at least three holes in the grounds of Herbaceous Border all of which lead to an underground maze of caves walkways and deep pits that have various game elements at the bottom and on the sides
These elements can be helpful such as vines gaseous thermals and metas or they can be inimical such as evil mushrooms and ant soldiers
On the surface she can encounter several Pink Roses and flying beetles and perhaps Ant Soldiers and Ant Lions
The pits are interconnected by the caves and crossed by the walkways some of which fall away beforeAlice can use them
Her endeavor to make her way through this maze in her quest to find the Caterpillar can be done from any entrance hole and by different paths though longer routes provide additional chances for her to perish on the way
One of the cave maze entrance holes is readily found by passing under the arch of stones
To get to anotherAlice must jump climb a series of ledges below the two metas then move off to find two vines hanging from the stone arch in order to swing to the area of the hole
To get to a third hole move straight ahead between the large mushroom and the yellow flower then bear to the left past a Heart Meta on a fungus turn sharp left and go up to find the hole below the mushroom
As stated Alice can enter the maze from any of the holes and she can proceed through any of the caves and you may well have fun trying the different ones but the path here described is the most direct
Go to the hole under the stone arch and jump into it
Proceed through the cave until it ends at a ledge overlooking a pit in which can be seen on the right a hanging vine and on the pit bottom two towers emitting vapors
Faintly through the bubbles can be seen a cave entrance on the wall opposite
All that Alice has to do is jump into the thermal bubbles then use the forward movement key to have her float across the pit to the cave entrance
If she falls to the bottom and survives the fall she can climb the vine and swing back to the ledge to try again to float across
Progress through this new cave until it divides whereuponAliceshould take the left passage toward a pathway stone bridge that leads across another pit
Just as she get to the bridge however the pair of big feet that flattened the White Rabbit stomp on the ground above and cause the bridge to fall away
In this pit she can again see on the right a vine and below two towers giving off thermal vapors also below are metas and an evil mushroom
Most important on the wall of the pit on the left is a Bounce Mushroom and overhead is a walkway that did not collapse when the other one did
You must haveAlice use the Mushroom to bounce up to the pathway
To do this haveAlice face the Jump Mushroom quickly press and release the W key and the spacebar then when she bounces up briefly press the W key and she will land on the pathway
If she misses the pathway and falls to the bottom of the pit she can get back to the ledge for another attempt by using the bubbles or the vine
Follow the pathway across the pit and through the cave on the other side to yet another pit with a pathway across it near the end of which is a fungus on which there is another Croquet Mallet weapon
Jump up and gather this Mallet even thoughAlice already has two since the more she has of a weapon the more effective it will be
Return to the path and continue through the cave as she approaches the end there will be a cutscene in which the Cheshire Cat tells Alice to go with the flow
Alice is now at the beginning of the exit of the underground maze
As previously stated other caves to traverse may be chosen and encounter other pits and obstacles but there will always be a way for her to persist and get to this point
From the ledge at the end of the cave can be seen two vines thermal bubbles rising from below and on the far wall a couple ledges below which are two fungi
In the distance is a ledge with something glowing on it which from the cutscene with the Cat just seen is another set of Card weapons
The Cat rsquo s admonition is a hint for Alice to jump onto the rising thermal bubbles she can then float to the first of the vines climb it to the level of the ledges on the wall swing to the next vine and then to a ledge
Do not go to the fungi
Jump to the next ledge and then to the Cards
Gather the Cards then go through the cave and climb out to the surface
Upon leaving the exit hole go up the slope and turn left moving until coming to a vine hanging from a tree branch
Swing across the chasm on the vine and keep going to soon come to another hole
Enter the hole to a cave that will take her to the next game venue Rolling Stones
At this point it is advisable forAlice to be in the running mode
This venue begins with a cutscene of flying beetles swarming in and one of them dropping a huge marble into the cave entrance whereAlicenow is
In her reduced size the marble can easily crush her and in the confines of the cave all she can do is run from it
Guide her down a ramp that curves around the wall of a large shaft and through a short cave where she uses a couple Bounce Mushrooms to get to another cave at the end of which she must cross another chasm on the bones of some large beast to yet another cave that terminates at sheet of thin ice and when she crosses that to a final cave she falls through the cave floor to another venue
This is a part of the game that is simple in concept but difficult in execution
Here is what to do before the initial flying beetle cutscene ends press the W key and hold it down through the entire episode so that Alice keeps continually running any delay such as storing a game will almost certainly allow the marble to catch up with her
Upon leaving the pathway down the shaft and entering the first cave a short runway appears at its end extending out into a chasm do not go out on it
At the point where the runway begins jump to the Bounce Mushroom on the right then immediately turnAliceslightly to the left so she lands on the fungus next to the Mushroom
She will keep running to the adjacent Bounce Mushroom and jump to the next cave
Keep her running through the cave and across the curving skeleton bridge through the cave on the other side and out on the ice sheet
She may cross without falling through but it will help if she jumps as she gets near the far edge of the ice
She will continue until she falls through the cave floor and away from the marble
Now she can stop running
Alice lands on a flat rock in a large cave with a floor of ice and slides to a stop at a cave wall
As might be expected in this frigid venue most of the surfaces are quite slippery and this presents a danger because she can slide off them to her doom
Go to the mouth of the cave where it overlooks a pit and jump up to a rock on the right so that she gets a good view of the pit
An Ice Wand weapon will be seen below on a platform atop a pedestal with narrow walkways leading to it from the left and right the latter one leading to an exit cave in the pit wall
From this rock it is possible to carefully jump to a ledge below carefully being the operative word and move up to a position above the Ice Wand so thatAlicecan jump to it
If she does this she will gather it into her weapons collection when she lands then the pathway to the exit cave will fall away
Face Alice toward the rocks from which she jumped to the Ice Wand platform and though it looks quite far she can leap and climb to a rock overlooking the entrance of the exit cave and then to this cave
If the foregoing access to the Ice Wand platform is found to be too difficult too slippery an easier route is to return to the cave overlooking the pit and jump up on the rock on the left then have her make her way along rocks and ledges on the side of the pit down to where she will be across from a ledge that encircles a conical spire
Jump to this ledge and on the other side of the spire is a walkway leading to the Ice Wand
When she gets to it and gathers it into her arsenal the pathway to the exit cave falls away if she does not pick it up this does not happen and she can follow the pathway to the exit cave but then she will not have the powerful Ice Wand which she will need many times
There is no other Ice Wand in the game
AsAlice enters the pit exit cave there will be a brief cutscene in which the marble appears and bounds with uncanny accuracy to this cave so be ready to start running again as the cutscene ends
As Alice approaches the far end of the cave she will find a recess in the left wall of the cave where she can stop and be out of the path of the marble and it will roll on past her alternatively she can exit the cave and move to the left to escape the marble as soon as she gets out
In either case be prepared to deal with three flying beetles immediately after the marble passes
Out of the cave to the left is another Jackbomb to acquire and strengthen that weapon then follow the path along the canyon edge to the right of the cave until it ends at two towers emitting thermal vapors
Leap into the bubbles and steerAlice across the canyon to the path on the other side
Follow this path and Alice will finally find the Caterpillar
After a lecture from him and instructions of what she must do now he will create a portal for her to go to the Fungiferous Flora venue Forest he says
Once againAlice is in a cavern this time in the center of a ring of stone pillars half of them short and flaming
She is facing a pair of evil mushrooms that she must get past but there is not enough room to go between or around them without being captured
She must run at either one and when very close she can jump over it to the exit cave behind it
The frustrated lsquo shroom will start spitting its green poisonous mist so she must get far enough away or turn and hit it about three times with her thrown knife
There is another evil mushroom at the cave exit and there is not enough headroom to jump over it but she can run past it if she stays as far as possible to the right but she must be ready to do battle immediately with an ant lion an ant soldier and flying beetles though she may be able to run past them as well
There are more enemies farther on in this hilly world of mushrooms most of latter being benign but several evil ones
Alice must proceed through this venue until she locates a pond that is under the trunk of a very large fallen tree on the left it is also near a dense group of large mushrooms with fat stems
The pond will be readily apparent because there are three metas floating above it
Swim through the pond keeping to the left so that when emerging she will be away from the grasp of an evil mushroom
AgainAlice has an alternative and a good one
In the cave facing the two evil mushrooms at the base of one of the tall pillars to her left she can find a Darkened Looking Glass which when she picks it up and looks at it renders her invisible for a short time her weapon can still be seen
In this unseen state she can bypass the mushrooms to the passage behind them leading to the Fungiferous Flora
If Alice starts running as soon as she locates the passage she can get beyond the enemies at the exit before her invisibility wears off but she must be alert that she is not near an evil mushroom when this happens there are a number of them around
In fact if Alice starts running immediately after the mirror cutscene fades and invisibility begins she can actually make it into the pond and almost out before visibility returns
A little farther along afterAlice gets out of the pond under the fallen tree she will have the opportunity pick up another of the Demon Dice
Then continue on staying close to passage edges to avoid evil mushrooms and she will shortly come to a tunnel opening in a tree
Jump in move forward to a ledge and jump down
Run forward to get past the flying beetles and Alice will become a captive of the Soldier Ant minions of the Centipede and thrown by them into his lair
This venue is primarily a difficult running battle with the Centipede very much like that with the Duchess with metas around the lair perimeter
This villain can spit venom bite and release miniature copies of himself
Hit the ground running and keep it up running backward might be a good idea as well as strafing
If a miniature centipede attaches itself toAlice it can be dislodged by jumping
When the Centipede rears up to lunge for a bite his weak spot is revealed a red area on his lower body
HaveAlice hit this a few times with her weapon of choice and he will be killed
The Ice Wand has been suggested but others will work perhaps the Jackbomb or throwing the knife
When mortally wounded he staggers a bit then falls
As he hits the ground stalactites fall from the roof forming a series of steps that are used to get to the mushroom up on the central rocks
A bite of this mushroom and Alice regains her full size and a video takes her onward
The scene into whichAlice has been transported is a flat rocky area containing lava pools and surrounded by huge boulders
Here she will meet several new enemy types and a number of old ones
The Heart and Spade Card Guards here are tougher and have more powerful weapons to use against her than the Club and Diamond Guards had previously
Right away there will be couple of the weak Fire Imps but they are readily eliminated by the Mallet Knife or Ice Wand
A weapon can be seen on a pillar not far away and it is always a good idea in this game to acquire a weapon when one becomes available
Getting to it is not a straight path and getting up the pillar might present a little difficulty but not much
This toy is the first part of the Jabberwock rsquo s Eye Staff and whenAlice gets it a short cutscene shows a gate below a stone arch going down a good indication of the next objective Alicecan see this arch from her position atop the pedestal and on the way to it a sign indicates that it leads to the cave of the Oracle
Passing a lava pool she will probably have her first encounter with a Magma Monster mdash the Ice Wand will take care of it
A Phantasmagoria will likely appear from under the arch mdash the Ice Wand works on this enemy as well
IfAlicestarts running when she is under the arch she will get past a lot of enemies otherwise she will have Boojums Imps and Card Guards to deal with
Shortly after three Sanities can be seen in the distance Alicewill have a dialog with the unseen Oracle in a cutscene
He tells her that ldquo the endgame with the Red Queen is possible only after you crush her sentinel the vile fierciucious and vengeful Jabberwock
Without the staff that bears his name destroying him is the hopeless work of a wasted life rdquo Alicetells him she has one piece of the staff and asks where she can find the rest
His reply ldquo Scattered throughout the world
When you have them all in hand checkmate is possible
The pale royals may be of use rdquo Another brief cutscene shows a castle with a portal in the gate and a couple red pawns patrolling in front of it
Alice interprets ldquo pale royals rdquo to mean the white chess King and Queen
There is a sign back at the entry area that indicates the direction to the Pale Realm so head back to that area and proceed up the pathway indicated by the sign
The rocky pathway eventually turns to one of scattered chessboard squares leading upward
Several red pawns can be seen moving on the tiles
The pawns are susceptible to the knife or mallet at a distance usually or the Ice Wand when close
About half way up the path distance that can be seen from its start there is a Darkened Looking Glass to be found with a little searching under a square but this Powerup is of limited use because its effect wears off before getting very far on this broken path
HaveAlice just keep going up the path dealing with enemies as she comes to them and when she reaches the portal in the castle entrance continue through into the next venue
After passing through the portal there is a cutscene of a clock followed by another of a White Rook coming out of a door and taking a position in front of it and the door closing
Proceed into the almost colorless hall it is after all the palace of the White King and Queen
The palace is under attack by the Red Queen rsquo s chess pieces and the multitude of the latter that are all about in this castle will assailAliceas well as white chess pieces
The Ice Wand is very effective against all of them Inside the hall on the right there is a wall fountain with a pool and on the left is a White Bishop standing in front of a short corridor
Go to the Bishop and a cutscene showsAlice becoming a white bishop at the other end of the corridor
Bishop Alice must traverse the room in front of her to the exit on the right and she can only move according to chess rules diagonally on white squares
There are impediments many squares are bottomless pits and several have deadly spikes going up and down over them
Clearly these squares must be avoided and this is easy to do because the view can be adjusted to see ahead where not to go so in about moves the bishop is at the exit and becomesAliceagain
Go up the steps ahead into a courtyard in which there is another Croquet Mallet weapon on a pedestal in a center pavilion
To jump up to the Mallet stand a little away from the pedestal Alicewill be returning to this courtyard several times so from the advantage of the pedestal top look about and note the features around the perimeter
She can see the White Rook of the initial cutscene the entry where she came in and a door that has the same appearance as the castle entry door
On either side of the latter are doors to small rooms that contain Sanities in case they are needed
On a low terrace to the left of the entry is a set of double doors leading into a room that has a platform elevator
WhenAlice steps on the elevator it lifts her to an opening where she can move off into a hall with two doors
Go to the one on the right the other leads to a dead end
Through this door and around a corner and she is looking down a corridor that has a row of noisy spikes shooting up from the floor dropping back down then repeating one tile farther away
When the spikes have moved to the far end of the corridor the process begins again
Watch it and see
All Alice has to do is get close to the spikes as they rise near her them follow one tile at a time as they move down the floor and when they recycle to start all over they will be way behind her and she can move on
Ahead is another open area this one with a bridge in the center over the chess challenge whenAlice was a bishop as it happens
Cross the bridge and go to the right to the doors with the lighted windows behind which are stairs leading upward with another Deck of Cards weapon in an alcove
At the top of the stairs is a door that opens to a courtyard balcony in which there is a floor lever
When Alice pulls it there follows a cutscene in which the doors from which the White Rook emerged at the start of this venue open again and he goes back through them
The doors remain open
There are several ways to backtrack to the courtyard floor but the most straightforward way to get there is simply to jump down from the balcony and from there follow the Rook through the doors he left open
He will fight with a Red Bishop Alice can either help him or let him do it on his own
Ahead and to the right is another open area and another bridge this one crossing water and with an unmoving waterwheel on the right
On the left are more spikes going down and up
Cross the bridge and go around a tower to them
Alice now faces another chess challenge similar to the one she had when she briefly became a bishop
Here a White Knight transforms her to another one and she must pass through another board of spikes and pits
It would be expected that her moves should conform to the L shaped ones of a knight but this is not always the case at least in the easy play mode at any rate getting through the challenge is quite easy and when accomplished she is again Alice
Move forward and go right up a set of steps turn right and go through a smaller door
Inside go up the stairs to find another Jackbomb weapon on a table
After picking it up go out the door along a walkway to a tower through that and across another walkway to a tower with a floor lever
Upon pulling it a cutscene shows the waterwheel turning and the water level rising
Return across the walkways to the area just outside the door to the stairs looking left across the waterAlice can see a Heart Meta at the edge of the water
Go down the stairs out the door and move to where she completed the knight chess challenge and became herself again
The Heart Meta is straight ahead
Enter the water and swim to it with the higher water level she can reach the edge of the wall and pull herself up
Go up the stairs through the large dark doors and along the corridor
After turning the corner a cutscene will take her to the next venue
Go through the doors into a vast courtyard in front of a very large castle
There are fallen White chess pieces which would indicate the loss of a fight
Proceed under the arch toward the castle gate and asAlicenears it a cutscene shows the captured White Queen being carried off by Red Rooks escorted by Red Knights
The Rooks carry the Queen to a conveyance and take off while the knights stay to attackAlice the Ice Wand takes care of them
Go into the castle to come upon a fight between Red and White pieces she can help if she wishes but it is not necessary
This room has a wall fountain on the far end balconies on each side and on each of these two identical doors
On either balcony enter the door closest to the fountain and move through the halls and doors following the only route that can be taken Alice will come upon another battle where the Red pieces may attack her
At the end of this fight she should be on a landing between two rising stairs and in front of a large picture of royalty
Go up the broad staircase opposite the picture and through the doors into the presence of the White King
Advance toward the King and in a cutscene a long exchange ensues in which the King saysAlice must help rescue the Queen and he presents her with a pawn to help her
She in turn says that her immediate mission is to get the remaining parts of the Jabberwock Eye Staff to which he makes no reply
He says she must make a fontal attack on the Red Castle and that the Rooks will show her the way
Immediately turn and follow either one of them mdash she will have to run to keep up mdash until he leads her to a portal
Jump to the portal and the next venue
MoveAlice forward in the hall in which she finds herself until she can jump down to a broad flight of steps
Go down these and then another flight to the right
Here except for the color everything looks familiar
She is near a bridge over some water and on the right is a turning waterwheel just as in the Pale Realm however Alice is not to follow the same movements of that venue
Do not go out on the bridge rather moveAlice to the foot of the tower on the left and enter the water
Turn around and swim to the two metas to be seen in the wall recess then jump out
She may find herself clinging to a rope or on a ledge next to it if the latter jump and grab it
Climb to the top and swing to the ledge up there
Follow the pathways through the next tower and to the door from which two Red Pawns emerge
When she goes through that door she will find the last of the Demon Dice weapons
Having acquired them there is another door to exit which takes her to a hallway where she is treated to a video of the Red King applying a guillotine to the White Queen
At the conclusion of the video she has to travel through a long succession of many different hallways and stairs until she finally comes to a hole in the floor
On the way when she comes to the porch on the right keep her close to the wall on the left to protect her from an attack from atop the wall
Jump through the hole to the floor below then go over the drawbridge to a chessboard platform with a pavilion floating above it
A cutscene shows the drawbridge rising then the Red King materializes
NowAlice must vanquish the King in one of those running fights such as she had with the Duchess and the Centipede
For distance attack he has the destructive laser beams that the Red Bishops have and up close he can strike using his scepter
As before metas appear around the edge of the arena but she must be careful not to run over the edge into the void when getting to them
The Ice Wand will suffice to eventually do him in but using it can exhaust the blue Will meter at least once probably more and if that happens Alice rsquo s weapon reverts to the Knife so after the meter receives a charge from the metas the Ice Wand must be keyed again
Or else do not let the Will meter become exhausted before going to the metas
Upon the King being conquered a long video shows a series of rather confusing scenes
One of these hasAlice placing the White Pawn she is carrying onto the chessboard where it changes to a White Queen mdash one of the rules in chess is that if a player can get a pawn to his opponent rsquo s last row he is allowed to replace it with any other piece
The Mad Hatter who is a villain in this version ofAlice rsquo s Adventures appears towering overAliceand delivers a hit to her head that knocks her out and she regains consciousness in the next venue
The confusing video continues Alice is lying on her back looking at a portrait of a man in a top hat a young Mad Hatter
then at several breaking clocks the scene rotates a quarter turn and she slides down to end up standing on a track with insane children walking back and forth
There are exits on both the left and right beyond which can be seen mirrored hallways
Going in either direction will move the game along but send Alice to the left
Curiously the innumerable mirrors do not show a reflection of her
As may be expected these halls contain many enemies both old and new but the Ice Wand takes care of them all
Despite appearances going through these hallways is quite linear
There are many places where the path divides but in each case one of them turns out to be a dead end and Alice just has to be sure that she don rsquo t become confused when backtracking and end up on the return path this is particularly true subsequent to repulsing an enemy attack
After a fairly long trek through the tunnels and mirrored hallways she will come upon another weapon for her arsenal the Jacks
After leaving the alcove whereAlice found the Jacks move straight ahead to the hallway end
Before her is a mirror wall but on the left is a display window through which can be seen a clock with pendulum swinging
Recall in this venue starting video all the breaking clocks mdash that was a hint
Turn around and proceed through the tunnel on the right and continue bearing right looking for the room where the clock was seen
It will be found behind a mirror that has been broken where there is also a large vertical pipe and a large horizontal pipe as well as a turning gear
Alice could jump onto and follow the horizontal pipe to get to the clock but she doesn rsquo t have to do that
Throw the knife at it and when it breaks through the window the mirror wall will be seen to rise so return there to see what awaits
What awaits is the end of a large tube about the size of the mirrors
Carefully and slowly approach this tube and whenAlicegets to a critical distance it vanishes to show on each side a pair of corridors facing each other
Continue ahead the tube reappears and she can leap into it
When she gets to the center a Phantasmagoria approaches from the other end after finishing it off with the Ice Wand she will find that the tube has rotated a quarter turn connecting to the two facing corridors
Looking at them it may be seen that they are mirror images of each other in fact most of the rest of this venue is a mirror image subsequent to this point Alice could go into either one of these corridors but for this walkthrough continue to the one ahead and in the rooms behind all the doors with windows use the knife or cards to break the clocks and stop the gas coming from the ceiling pipes
Each time she does this immediately key the Ice Wand again so that she will be able to take care of the several Spiders that drop from the walls as she moves along the corridors
After four rooms go back through the tube and repeat this clock breaking action in the other corridor for another four
In one of these eight rooms the clock is already broken
When she breaks the clock of the last room there is a cutscene of a vertical pipe that begins to leak and then explodes along with a door next to it
The glimpse of the room behind the burst door is too brief to tell what it contains
Now go through the two sets of big wooden double doors at the end of the corridor
WhenAlice goes through them she will be attacked by one to four Boojums so be ready for them
Try to do this close by maybe get them to follow Alice inside the outer door so that their metas will not be out of reach
She may have to wait a bit to be sure that all appear that are going to
Beyond the doors is a short section of solid floor followed by three tilting platforms the first and last tilt front to back the middle one side to side
WhenAlice steps out onto the first one it starts to sink under her weight run up and get to the second one and if she stays in the middle it will not tilt and she can walk to the third
Walk out onto this one and it will sink beneath her
Alice will slide down to the edge but not off
Continue walking up the steeply tilted platform and as she approaches the center it will start to level itself
When the far edge is near the ledge below the doors that she must reach run up jump to the ledge and climb up to face another of the big wooden double doors
If Alice falls into the void during any of this she will end up between the first two doors and can try again
Boojums already eliminated will not reappear but there may be others
Inside the doors is the scene that was seen in the cutscene that so briefly showed when she broke the last clock
Be prepared for a couple of immediate enemies
Looking down the long room it appears to be one of mechanical activity with a wide walkway reaching to the other end
At intervals along both sides are large pipes with openings pointed upward these are suction sources that will pullAlice off the walkway into the water below if she gets too close to any of them
Possibly she will land on a ledge instead of in the water in which case she may be able to reach a rope and swing back to the walkway or even jump back
Down near the middle of the walkway may be seen a Clockwork Automaton
Select the Jacks and move toward it being careful not to get caught by a suction pipe until a rotating targeting reticle appears on it
Throwing the Jacks a couple times should take care of the Automaton
The Demon Dice may work as well
However depending on how effectively the weapons are used the Automaton may be able to reachAlice in which case quickly switch to the Ice Wand
The way to get past the suction pipes is to run
Off to the side of the walkway center where the Clockwork Automaton was first seen are three large rings in a row swinging from chains and a narrow walkway leading to them
WhatAlicemust do is run down to and out on this latter walkway to the rings go through them and onto another walkway that leads to an exit from this area
Of course this not that easy because there is a Boojum that will scream her off the narrow walkway and if she manages to dispose of it there is another Clockwork Automaton hidden near the second walkway to blow her off by the explosives it throws
Difficult or not it must be done
BeforeAlice runs down to the rings try waiting for the Boojum to come up to her as it will be easy to use the Ice Wand to dispose of it near the long room entrance
Then Jacks in hand make the run to the rings and look for the Automaton by the right hand ring and get it in the swirling reticle so the Jacks toss will be effective
Getting so that she is shielded by the rings is one possibility
With no more attacks imminent she can take her time passing through the swinging rings to the far walkway and then to the exit door
Going through the doorAlice meets Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee for another running battle such as those that she has had before
Again the Jackbomb is the weapon of choice or maybe the Jacks with the Ice Wand perhaps being used after a while
As she races around the arena look for a raised area on the sides of it as there will always be one or two metas on it to lift the Sanity meter level
The Dums spawn miniature versions of themselves to aid in their attack and these leave behind metas when destroyed
At the successful conclusion of the battle there is a cutscene in which the Mad Hatter appears for an enigmatic conversation withAlice as follows ldquo Bad timing
Pity
Reliable help is so hard to find these days
You rsquo re just in time for tea rdquo ldquo I only take tea with my friends rdquo ldquo Count me among them
Accurately
I mean honestly
That rsquo s the truth
Oh I quite forgot
You and the truth are not on familiar terms rdquo ldquo And you would know rdquo ldquo Truth is always bitter to those who fear it rdquo ldquo I fear nothing rdquo ldquo False
You fear much A return to the asylum for example The memories that drove you there More years in shall we say supervised hospitalization Ah yes you fear much
All that might be avoided rdquo ldquo How
Tell me what do you mean rdquo The Hatter does not answer
Instead the roof falls in and Alice goes to the next venue
It looks as though the Mad Hatter has placedAlice in a padded room
Go out the opening and she is in another maelstrom of suspended fragmentary platforms and swirling skies with objects mostly clocks and watches this time floating by
Move forward onto the large astrological female symbol in front of the big clock which will be revisited later
Take two hops to the chessboard and the door on the right go through it and down the steps of tiles past the turning double helix and into a circular gallery with a pool in the center and a gear high above it
Go in either direction around the gallery to a floor lever and pull it to start the gear rotating
Go back around the gallery to another floor lever and pull it to lower the rotating gear so that Alice can hop onto it
As she rotates on the gear she can see in one of the several openings a meta and splashed on the wall above it the words ldquo You rsquo re Next rdquo
Anticipate the passing of this opening so that she can jump to it then proceed through the door and up another set of tile steps to a pool containing thirteen pillars with clock faces on them
Across the pool is another floor lever and to the right is an opening closed off by panels
The Cheshire Cat appears and says ldquo A reflection exposes more reality than the object it echoes rdquo Look in the mirror only four of the pillars there show clock faces these are the ones on which it is safe to step
Jump over to the floor lever pull it and jump back
The panels in the opening to the right have moved aside so now jump over there
The corridor to the right has several locked doors and a vertically barred gate also locked through which may be seen more tile steps leading down
Ahead a bit from the opening at the clock pillars and to the left is another short corridor in which are two busts of the Mad Hatter an enormous key protruding from a keyhole in the floor locked doors and a Phantasmagoria
HaveAlicetake care of it now or it will follow her
Go back out and continue to the left
Around the corner and near the corridor end on the right is an alcove with some floor tiles displaced so that she can jump down to the room below
Do that and be ready for Spiders from here on
Up the tile steps is the locked gate so follow the corridor instead which takesAlice to the Hatter rsquo s laboratory where in a long video she sees that he is performing strange and despicable experiments on Insane Children the March Hare and the Dormouse
There is conversation with the latter two and she learns that the Hatter is due to come for a check at o rsquo clockprecisely
There is another floor lever forAlice to pull and when she does that there is a cutscene of the vertically barred gate rising and another of the Hatter striking the enormous key which then sinks to the floor
Alice can't do anything for the Hare and Mouse so leave and return to the room into which she jumped from above
Go up the tile steps to the now open gate and on to the corridor with the key recessed into the floor
The doors there are now open
Go through them to a half gear platform down and up tile steps to another half gear and through the doors there
There follows a video where Alice has a conversation with a gryphon in a cage ldquo Those two seem to barely comprehend their situation rdquo ldquo They rsquo re blithering idiots
But the Hatter does come at on the dot rdquo ldquo For his tea rdquo ldquo No
To check his experiments
With gears springs levers and mechanical gizzards
He seeks an impossible precision like a watchmaker obsessed with infinitesimal fractions of seconds or a mathematician who tries to square the circle
He rsquo ll turn all the inhabitants into his automatons or kill them in the attempt rdquo ldquo That rsquo s simply awful
o rsquo clock you say rdquo ldquo precisely by that clock rdquo ldquo Hmm Perhaps comes early today rdquo Leave the room and go down the tile steps to the right and continue ahead out into the maelstrom to be confronted with a portal
Through the portal andAlice is on a giant table set for tea with two candles four teacups and four chairs mdash each with a Spider on it
Get them to attack and get them out of the way
Each of the teacups is filled with hot tea and a floating sugar cube
What Alice is to do is leap to a chair cushion and if gauged correctly she will bounce back into the teacup and sink the sugar cube
She must jump out quickly because the tea is hot and she must turn so that she lands on the table
After all four sugar cubes have been sunk the clock floating above the end of the tea table lowers and a portal appears in it
Going through this portal allowsAlice to enter the clock seen at the beginning of this venue
In it there is a floor lever
Move to the other side and pull it and a cutscene shows the clock hands moving to and the clock in front of the gryphon now also shows this time
A door down some tile steps is open and contains a portal
The other side of the portal shows the arena in whichAliceis to have another running fight this time with the Mad Hatter
In the center of the arena is the second part of the Jabberwock Eye Staff
Select the Jacks then move to pick up the Staff part
As it happens she mdash thankfully does not actually need to engage in a running fight with the Hatter though she could just as soon as he materializes repeatedly hit him with the primary Jack attack and he will be defeated before he can defeatAlice
If she acts quickly she can do this without even running but it wouldn rsquo t hurt to do so
With the Hatter lying headless on the arena floor move straight ahead to the clock on the edge of the arena where a pair of weights is going up and down
Hop on either one and ride it to the top where she can get off and collect the Dead Time Watch which when called shows flags at the bottom of both the red Sanity column and the blue Will column
When used everything butAlicestops for about seconds as the Will flag slowly disappears after the Watch is used it cannot be called again for a presently undetermined period
When the Cat gets through speaking the doors will open on yet another portal
AfterAlice goes through a video begins in which the cage holding the gryphon is pulled apart and he flies out to land by Alice who happens to be waiting below
The gryphon is grateful to her for disposing of the Mad Hatter and thus releasing him and he tells her so ldquo With gratitude I offer you my services rdquo ldquo Promise only what you rsquo re prepared to deliver
I am destined to battle the Red Queen
The outcome is uncertain rdquo ldquo You won't fight alone
Permit me to serve as your commander
I rsquo ll muster the forces whose alliance your courage and skill have already won rdquo ldquo How shall we prepare for battle rdquo ldquo An assault on the Queen depends on breaching the gates to her kingdom
Only the Jabberwock rsquo s Eye Staff can pry them open
If you open the gates I rsquo ll lead the troops to victory
Let us right the wrongs of the world together rdquo She climbs on his back and he flies with her to Jabberwock country the Land of Fire and Brimstone
This is a bleak place all rocks
The gryphon putsAlice down on a flat area surrounded by huge boulders
He tells her get what allies she can and he will come back with reinforcements and he then flies away
Have Alice move ahead dealing with Fire Imps as needed and she will come upon a lava pool that she can cross by hopping from rock to rock to the far side
The way to the Jabberwock is up the formidable cliff that she is now facing
Start by going to the first meta on the left then to the rock below the second one
From there she can walk up a light grey slope where at the top is a Will that she perhaps can use
Continue ahead and she will soon see another up on a rock
Jump up to it and a short way past it is a cleft between two rocks that leads to another slope at the top of which from behind a rock can be seen two Jabberspawn
One of them appears to be dancing
SinceAlice is sheltered by the rock toss a couple of Jackbombs at them
When things settle down go past where they were and a Ragebox will soon be seen
Move toward it then slide down the steep slope on the left and follow the valley into a cave
Inside are more lava pools and streams and more rocks for jumping
She will soon come upon a lavafall and up to the right are two more Jabberspawn which the Jackbomb should again take of
Alternatively she can jump up and use the Ice Wand when they come to her
Move onward to a rock pillar
She can go around it on either side to the right she will meet a Magma Monster to the left she will not
In the distance on the other side of the lava river can be seen another weapon on a ledge and whenAlice gets to it after some rock hopping she will find another set of Jacks
Don rsquo t let her tarry on this ledge after she gets the Jacks as there is a Fire Snark in the lava who will emerge and throw a fire stream at her and unless she can dodge she will be done for after a couple of those
As a precaution perhaps take just a moment to toss a couple Jackbombs into the lava though that may not be effective in which case the delay could be costly
Continue quickly rock hopping to get to the other side of the lava stream
Move along the rocks a short way and there will be a fairly long jump across the lava then jump to and climb a rock face to a level area with a couple Fire Imps running around and more in the distance
Cross the area to a rock on which there is one Fire Imp
Eliminate it then jump up and toss a couple Jackbombs into the lava because there is a Fire Snark lurking there
Maybe toss one in before jumping up on the rock
From this rock it is a long leap but possible across the lava to a ledge on the left side of the stream
From hereAlice has a long and perilous rock hopping trip upstream
Other than Fire Imps the only enemy she will encounter is a Jabberspawn that she can take care of with Jacks
Maybe another Fire Snark
Eventually she will arrive at a grey sloping area on the right bank from where can be seen a Ragebox on the other side and more Fire Imps
Go around a big rock to the right away from the lava and up a valley enemies
where she will again meet the Oracle and this time he will be seen
There is a long discussion about whyAlice is here in Wonderland and also that she must hurry and complete her mission
The reason for this haste is not stated and in fact it is not necessary
After this head up to the left to a black rock on which there is a small meta to which she must jump
Standing on the level area where the meta is jump up to the next meta then turn about and jump and climb to a third one
From there go to the large opening in the rocks where there is a good view of the Jabberwock rsquo s house high up on the rock pile
Getting there is not easy
There are two Fire Imps to be seen get rid of the closer one becauseAliceneeds to get on that rock
Start from the left and keep jumping until she gets there then make a giant leap to a rather large long rock to the right that is near the lava surface
Have the Ice Wand ready because a Magma Monster may come out of the lava
Begin rock hopping toward the wall on the right and toss Jackbombs into the lava along the way to take care of Fire Snarks
WhenAlice gets to the wall jump upward on ledges
There is one that is a high jump that can be difficult she has to be in the correct location and have the right view
When she makes it she must then leap to a ledge on the wall below the house and from there to the top
For this last jump hold the jump key down so that Alice makes it to the ground by the house in a double jump
Go around to the front of the house where the door shows a portal forAliceto enter and meet the Jabberwock
The Jabberwock is a grotesque creature and when he confrontsAliceas she comes through the portal he spends considerable time taunting her and giving her a bad time about her actions during the fire that seems to be assuming more and more importance as the game progresses
When he finally finishes she is to have a running fight with him
He has several powerful ways to attack and it appears to be an impossible contest but there is a relatively easy way to survive
The arena is a little smaller than the previous ones with only one meta near the edge and like the Red King rsquo s chessboard is surrounded by a void soAlicecan fall off its ragged edges
The thing to do is equip her with the Ice Wand then she must immediately start running as the confrontation begins
Keep her far from the beast dashing and swerving near the edges and doubling back so that she will be harder to hit
Shortly a Jabberspawn will join the fray and she can annihilate it with the Wand then resume the chase
Another Jabberspawn will arrive and when she Ices it and runs just a little more the gryphon will arrive to take on the Jabberwock
During the fight the gryphon will tear out an eye from the Jabberwock who will then fly away leaving Alice with the final part for the Jabberwock Eye Staff
On to the next venue
This is a familiar place asAlice has been here before when she got the first part of the Jabberwock's Eye Staff
Leap across the narrow lava stream and head for the arch above the gate
A feature not here before is Humpty Dumpty sitting on a ledge and smoking a cigar
From his appearance the King rsquo s men and horses were able to put him together again after all but didn rsquo t do a very good job of it Alicemust jump up on the ledge next to him and as she does note the brick in the wall slide inward
Go down to the gate which is closed again
To the left of it there is now an opening to a crypt in whichAlice will find the last weapon for her arsenal the Blunderbuss
A very powerful device but it will completely empty the Will meter when used
From here go to the only path left open the one to the Majestic Maze
WhenAlice starts up the path and turns the corner she will come up against several Spade and Heart Card Guards both close and at a distance
These Guards are more powerful than the other two suits and the best weapon to use against them at a distance is probably the Jacks closeup the Ice Wand
Move up the valley fighting Guards until coming to a large curtain blocking it off
Running and jumping will get her past Guards but at the expense of some Sanity
Equip Alice with the Jabberwock's Eye Staff get close to the curtain and hold down the left mouse button to make a spectacular opening to the Majestic Maze
The first thing to be aware of now that Alice is in Queen of Hearts Land is that enemies are more numerous and frequently come in groups and in light of this much increased danger this walkthrough is annotated by an E where this happens
Perhaps the general weapon of choice is the Jacks though the Jackbomb has its place if used judiciously
The Ice Wand is still the best for closeup fighting including Boojums if the Sanity meter is near full
Remember that the Card Guards now throw explosives rather than cards Alice has just entered the first maze of this Land
There is more than one path to get to the exit but the following is probably a little shorter than others
Exchange the Jabberwock's Eye Staff for one of the above weapons and head into the Maze
From the large vase at the entrance go left around the corner up a slope in a tunnel up steps that turn right and ahead to a junction
Go right
Follow the path around the corner E up a slope under an arch and right down a slope to a junction E at which there is a Ragebox
Go right and down a slope to a portal E she cannot enter it
Continue down the slope around the corner E passing through a sort of heart shaped tunnel and around the corner E to a really heart shaped tunnel that divides just after the entrance
Proceed through either side mdash they join again mdash and enter another sort of heart shaped tunnel where a portal can be seen at the far end
About half way through an Insane Child dashes across the pathway and a gate closes over the portal
WhenAlice gets to the end of the tunnel she can see that the Child has gone through another portal the one she could not enter from the other side of it and had been standing on a stack of tiles containing a floor switch that held open the gate
If Alice steps on top of the stack the gate opens again but when she steps off it closes quickly before she can get to it
Move close to the switch plate and use the secondary Ice Wand attack to build an ice wall on it the gate opens and Alice can approach and pass through the portal
Take a moment to look around Alice is in a tower built over a lava pool showing many chimneys emitting vapor and by now it is pretty well established that she is going to have to float on them
There are quite a few platforms connected by rather rickety walkways and high above is a portal that past experience indicates is probably her destination
Be warned that this place is full of Boojums really a lot of them but no other enemies
Equip Alice with the Ice Wand or Croquet Mallet and be very alert
If possible when they appear try to get her in a position so that she will not be blown off the platforms and walkways and that metas can be retrieved when Boojums are destroyed
Things are pretty easy at first
From the entry platform float straight ahead on vapors across a short space to another platform then repeat to the right
Follow the walkway around the pillar to the next platform higher up
Now things get more difficult floating on the vapors is not so bad but there are three masks in the wall on the left that can blowAlice off the vapors to the lava below
Fortunately these masks blow intermittently so she must watch and hover until it momentarily stops then move ahead before it starts again
The fact that there are three complicates this process
She may also have a little problem getting off the vapors to the platform at the end
From this latter platform move upward to another one then float across a narrow space to a walkway that leads into an opening in the wall
Follow the stone passageway to a platform that overlooks the area whereAlice was when she came through the entrance portal mdash which can be seen below
Go up the walkway along the wall to reach the highest platform of the many in the tower
From here there is a trip over a row of many chimneys but it is a relatively easy one because there is only one mask blowing across and it appears to be not very active
At the end go up to another platform then float over three chimneys to the final passageway leading to the exit portal
This venue is really a pain because of the swimming that must be done
Following the Mock Turtle previously was bad enough but at least he was there as a guide
Here there is a very confusing jumble of rocks and passages whereinAlicemust find a particular above water opening among several where she can emerge into a cave
And of course there are those pesky Snarks that can nibble her to death if she doesn rsquo t kill them or get away from them
The portal high in the vapor tower has depositedAlice at the entrance to another maze
This one is a brick wall and hedge maze as was the previous one except that here the lights along the walls are aces of diamonds rather than clubs
She is standing in front of some steps and in the distance is a tower that has three faucet spouts discharging streams of what is presumed to be water
Ascend the steps and follow the pathway around the corner to a junction
Peek around the corner to the left and spy a Card Guard at the bottom of the slope
Toss a Jackbomb down there so that he will not come up and attack
After that go right then left down the path E and at the bottom go left into a tunnel
Shortly she will see off to the right a water filled square opening in a grassy plot E
Go to it and walk into the water
GettingAlice to swim where you want her to sometimes presents an exercise in aggravation but here in principle is what she should do swim to the bottom of the shaft look to the left to find a passage to a small group of bubbles
Swim to them then a little to the right through another passage to a much larger group of larger bubbles
As you will remember bubbles are supposed to supply Alice with air
Continue straight ahead past a light on the bottom and up to a cave
Pass to the right of a round masonry column built of stone blocks and bear right between rocks toward three cylindrically shaped walls next to each other and be looking for three metas in a row though visible from under water they are on land and when found Alice can jump out of the water to them
After she gets out move away from the water as a Snark may try attacks not yet encountered a tongue whip which can pullAlice back in the water or spit green venom in the manner that Fire Snarks shot fire
A Jackbomb tossed in might discourage it
Maybe not but if it does a meta will be seen underwater
Go up to the peak of the high rock from where the rest of the masonry block pillar is apparent and immediately to the right of it across the water is a level area with a hanging light above it
A Card Guard is hiding there
If she can use the Jacks to remove him from this location do so
Go down to the very edge of the rock and use the jump footprints to locate another rock across the water to whichAlicecan leap this may take a little searching
Jump across and again quickly move away from the water as the Snark may still be there
She might well toss in a couple Jackbombs before jumping
Then if she was not able to eliminate the Guard before quickly do it now
There is a Heart Meta floating nearby that she can probably use by now
Move around on the rocks so that she can jump to the level area where the Guard is now only a meta
Be careful in choosing the point from which to jump so that she does not bounce sideways off the roof and into the water
Go around the rectangular hole in the floor and move to the corridor with a metal grating floor E
Proceed past the big metal spider to the corridor end where there is a floor lever
Upon pulling it a cutscene shows a grating gate rising somewhere at the end of a long large underwater pipe
The lever also opened doors releasing two Clockwork Automatons nearby but as usual the Ice Wand will take care of them
In addition it has dropped a gate at the end of the corridor whereAlice entered it so she can't go back
Return to the metal spider and go down the steps across from it where she will come to a room in which is another metal spider and a large spiral stairway
Go up the stairway and along a walkway into a small room then through an opening on the right and along a grating walkway
Hop over a low wall onto a pipe and keep going to a Heart Meta in an opening whereAlicecan reenter the water
She must find the large pipe that was shown in the cutscene
Swim through a passage in the rocks on the right to find the cluster of large bubbles that she swam through when she first entered the water
As before take the same path past the light on the floor and past the masonry column but keep going beyond the structure with the open arched gate and around to the left
There is the pipe
As she swims through it make use of the two sets of bubbles in it
After she goes through the gate that opened go up a long shaft from which she will emerge in the maze upper level
Note ifAlice goes up into the cave as she did after the first swim past the masonry block pillar she can follow the same path as she did at that time to the area where the Card Guard was hiding and she can reenter the water through the rectangular opening in the floor
She will be right at the entrance to the large pipe
In the maze moveAlice away from the water because a Snark may have followed her up and can tongue whip her back in
Move along the path right left and she will be at a junction E
Go left here then immediately right and continue until she comes to a bridge
Cross the bridge and follow the path to the right left left again and right to a floor lever
Below can be seen a portal with a gate in front of it
Have Alice pull the lever and it may be seen that the gate has opened
Turn around and take the path to the right at the end of which she can jump to the maze lower level
About face and go into the tunnel to the portal E and on the next venue
More swimming mdash lots of it
More aggravation mdash lots of it
The latter in trying to getAlice to swim where you want her to and also because of the Snarks
There are no other enemies here but there is a multitude of Snarks and they are the vicious kind that employ tongue whips and venom shooting Alicecan try and outswim them but as a general rule success is more likely if she fights them then uses the resulting metas to restore her Sanity level
Maneuvering Alice so her knife is effective is not all that easy and despite the Mock Turtle making her an honorary reptile mdash she is still wearing the turtle shell under water mdash she must remember to go to the surface for air quite frequently
She can also toss Jackbombs into the water to eliminate Snarks before swimming sometimes this works and sometimes not if it does get a Snark a meta will be seen under water
However she must be careful with the Jackbomb because it does not always go where she is trying to throw it and it could capriciously land nearby rather than in the water
In this location in that tower with the water coming from the faucet nozzles there are three upright pipes that are capped with floats attached to the lids
The water level must be raised in steps so that the floats will successively lift the lids andAlice can enter the pipes
The first of these may seen in the water of the first room the one in which she entered this venue the more or less spherical object is the float and the lid is behind it
A closer look may be had by jumping to them but it serves little purpose
Beware of Snarks attacking from the water
From the portal go through the passageway on the right to get to the second of the two rooms in this venue
There are more Snarks in the water here than the first room
The device to raise the water level the first time is on the far side of this room and it is not easy to find
There is no way to get there but to swim
Fight the Snarks and with all of them eliminatedAlicecan take her time looking for the place to jump out
Go under the dark flat area then turn back and she can climb out and up a series of risers to a walkway where there is a hanging platform that is the water level switch
Even though she has just killed all the Snarks more have arrived from somewhere and are lurking in the water ready to spit venom
Jackbombs have worked here
Step onto the platform which will sink into the rising water
Swim forward a little way and there is above the water an opening in the brick wall on the right to whichAlice can climb or jump
Walk through the passage to come out on the walkway in the first room where the Cheshire Cat was sitting
Just as she comes to the column inside the passageway look up and note the rectangular opening in the ceiling When she gets back to the first room stay in the doorway to avoid Snarks and look around
Above are two more water level switch platforms to the left in the room where this venue began is the float now holding open the first pipe cap and to the right is the one to which she must go next
The portal is now under water
Enter the water to the left do battle with the Snarks haveAliceget some air and then enter and swim down the pipe
There are two screens with apertures she must go through then go horizontally a bit turn right to some life saving bubbles
Turn about and swim toward the fan and turn left just before reaching it then go up to the surface where she will jump to a ledge that goes around the pipe just above the water
Climb to the top of the pipe then walk around to the wooden platform
Jump and climb the brick riser and she will have reached the second water level switch
Below is the float for the pipe she has just traversed and ahead on the other side of the walkway is the one to which she must go next
Get on the switch platform and as it lowers the water rises again so that it is above the walkway and she can swim over it to the second pipe now uncapped by its float
To avoid a Snark jump ahead just before the switch platform reaches the water
Swim straight ahead into the top of the pipe and down to bubbles coming from a disk
This is a straight shot from the platform to the pipe andAliceneedn rsquo t fight the Snarks
If one follows down the pipe dispatch it and gather in the meta
Swim right left and right again down to bubbles coming from a mesh grate
Now she must turn around and swim toward the fan at the far end of the pipe
Keep to the upper left and tap the jump key to avoid being pulled into the fan at the right or the one below
Just before the fan at the end turn left and then go upward through a fan in the space where blades have broken off
When she gets to the top of the pipe she will jump out to the rim of the pipe
IfAliceneeds more air before going up through the broken fan there are more bubbles nearby
The exit pipe is surrounded by a brick wall with two low sections in it
Move to the one at the left and climb the three risers quickly in order to try to avoid Snark venom and at the top stand in the center Alice is now at the third and last water level switch across which can be seen a passageway that is above the one used earlier now under water to go from the second room to the first
Jump on the switch platform and once again jump when the platform nears the water
HaveAlicein the run mode so that she can scurry into the passageway otherwise she will be drawn back into the water by a Snark tongue whip
She can probably use the Heart Meta before diving into the rectangular opening that takes her down to the now submerged passageway and back to the second room
The third pipe is right before her so enter and swim down to the portal and back to the maze
Alice is back in a brick wall and hedge maze this one with ace of spades lights to distinguish it from the others
There is another tower to be seen this one with a gear on the top and she will be alternating between it and the maze
When in it she will encounter challenges involving a lot of mechanical equipment mostly very large gears some of it reminiscent of that in the mine at the beginning of this game
The lava is here as well as are many enemies
Equip Alice with the Ice Wand
From the pleasant vista of the arrival turn about and walk to the wall to discover the lava on which this venue is floating
To the right and just above the lava surface is a turning clockwork escapement wheel and she has to work her way down to it jump on then almost immediately jump off to the adjacent gear island or be brushed into the lava
There are two other gear islands jump to them
Don rsquo t hesitate on the center one asAlice rsquo s weight causes it to sink into the lava
The walls of the lava stream have many geartooth shaped lamp housings that may be used to get first to the right side E then at the end where the stream disappears underground to the left side
Now follow the path inside and up a ramp where water going into the lava generates steam acting on vanes to turn a horizontal wheel
Jump onto the cross member of the wheel and when near a passageway entrance on the other side leap to it
This pathway takesAlice to the lower level of the cavernous interior of the tower
Here is a vertical turning gear having a large aperture in it but is otherwise solid
Get close to the gear on its right side and when the aperture is vertical mdash or just before mdash jump through it
There is another aperture gear to pass but before doing so look upward and note the multitude of slowly turning interworking gears and shafts
Alice will spend quite some time here going in and out as she presses ever upward
Treat the second aperture gear the same as the first but here there is a crankshaft operating a bellows overhead and it keeps her from getting close to the gear until it moves out of the way
After these gears it is just one long walk run through several passages meeting the occasional enemy then going outside to the maze for the same path following action
By now it may have been noticed that this venue is really not a maze Alice just keeps going wherever the path leads interspersed with challenges for her to overcome
This is characteristic of the entire venue and continues until she reaches the exit
From the outside mazeAlice goes inside again and on to the next challenge
She is higher in the tower and must get across a walkway that is below a vertical gear whose teeth nearly touch the walkway before and after the gear are alternating jets from bellows operated by the two aperture gears
The jets can blowAliceoff the walkway to the lava over which the tower is built and the slightest touch of a gear tooth will do her in so it is a matter of timing to get her across and continuing on her way through a passage that takes her up to another level in the tower
Alice will come to an opening beyond which is a rotating horizontal gear
It is an easy leap to this gear where she is in no danger as long as she does not go out on the teeth
However when she is ready to jump to the rising vapors go out on a gear tooth and leap when she is opposite them
In the first plume turn right and float to the next one and on to the balcony E
Move around the balcony to the rising vapors at the other end of it
Jump to the first plume move to the next one and float a little higher on it then turn to face the large horizontal gear
Float forward slightly and gauging her movement carefully go forward to one of the gear teeth
Move off the tooth and jump climb to a platform when the gear brings her around to it
The passageway from this platform takes her to the yet one more gear
From the small platform she must jump to a gear tooth and be sure and do so well before it comes opposite her or she will miss
Stay well away from the hub or she will be brushed off
Jump climb to the platform when she comes to it
Improbable as it may seem whenAlice goes out the two doors after moving ever upwards in the machine works she is back in the maze
Proceed along the path E and she will reach a clearing E where on the opposite side are two heart shaped plates going alternately up and down
Getting past them is simple as is moving beyond the next set that is swinging from side to side
Continuing on she will come to three vapor chimneys over a waterfall that has been seen before
Just jump into the vapors and ride them up to the ledge beyond the last one
Go to the right and follow the passageway to the last challenge of this venue that of getting past three thick rotating gears
Get very close to each gear then run at a tooth which should be just out of the way whenAlicegets to it
After the third gear proceed to the exit portal
If the just finished gear challenges were a pain they pale by comparison with the ones now to be encountered
This venue is probably located in another tower and its only game purpose seems to be to getAlice to the portal that takes her to the next one
It has three rooms all filled with machinery of sorts and the bulk ofAlice rsquo s progress is made by jumping amongst it
Each room starts from an entry platform from which can be seen most of the room and Alice must leap from machine piece to machine piece to get to the room exit at the far side
She can perish if for example being hit by a moving machine part but in the case of falling after making a jump she mysteriously returns to the room starting platform
One other thing there are no enemies here
The first room is filled with gears all rotating horizontally with the exception of a bevel gear
In the left foreground the gears are thin in the right rear they are quite thick
The latter are rising and falling r amp f gears and of course they are not doing so in unison
What is to be done is leap from gear to gear and eventually to the exit passageway
Head for the thick r amp f gears because this passageway is behind them
Jumping from rotating gears is disorienting and a challenge in timing anticipation particularly if the rotation is fast
Passing through this room is an exercise in patience and persistence but it can finally be accomplished andAlice can follow the passageway to the next room
The Dead Time Watch might find an application here
Most of the next room contains pedal pairs similar to the ones used on bicycles
Use the first two to get down to the left ledge of the two with the metas on them that are on the left wall from there jump to the swinging single pedal and then to the other ledge
Looking upAlice can see two r amp f gears on the same shaft and a primitive gear whose teeth are spokes uniformly spaced between end caps so that it is hollow
There is a pedal pair close to the ledge that will carry her to the lower r amp f gear from which she can leap to the inside of the primitive gear
Looking toward the entry platform will show yet another pedal pair that be can used to get to the top of the primitive gear then to the upper r amp f gear from which Alice jumps to the vertically rotating spur gear and then to a platform by the room exit passageway
The third and final room has in it some equipment pieces that resemble clockworks
Hop on the r amp f gear in front of the entrance platform and ride it down soAlice can jump to the pivot arm that holds the wheel running back and forth along the wall
Move along the arm toward its pivot so she can get on the lower gear of the r amp f pair
Next she must leap to the tilting platform and adjust her position and that of the platform so she can get on the r amp f gear at the other end
Repeat this action with the upper tilting platform to get to the upper r amp f gear
Jump to the thin grey horizontal wheel one can fall through this one and then to the r amp f gear on the opposite side of the big centerless escapement from where Alice has been
When the escapement teeth are horizontal enough so that she will not slide off jump there and quickly position her in the center so she will pass through the fork in the hammer bar
When through immediately turn and go along the bar to its pivot from which she can jump to the exit portal
IfAlice wishes she can jump to the other side of the portal rather than the near one and look through the opening where she will see far below the gears of the first room
The portal may be entered from either side
Alice has entered the arena where she must have another running fight with the Jabberwock
First there is a video of a flying battle between the Jabberwock and the gryphon which the latter loses and falls mortally wounded
The Wock destroys the bridge Alice used to enter this arena from the machinery tower and the only other access is an open drawbridge so she can't leave the arena
The fight with the Jabberwock is of course the most difficult one so far
He has several weapons a fire stream being one of the worst and he uses it from above since he can fly
The only weapons to fight him are the Eye Staff and the Blunderbuss and whichever is chosen should be used immediately before he begins to fly
If Alice can hit him enough times during the fight he is forced to fight on the ground where he is more vulnerable
There is only one meta at the arena edge though it reappears quickly she has to jump to get it and may fall off the edge
Keep running jumping strafing and weaving the gryphon will provide some protection and she can hide briefly under its wing
Eventually a technique will be found that will do the Wock in which brings on another video wherein the gryphon gasps out some dying words to Alice about continuing the battle with the Red Queen and then expires leaving her overcome with grief
The drawbridge may be seen to lower the screen trembles when the bridge hits the ground so go across it to the Red Queen rsquo s stronghold
A Card Guard jumps in front ofAlice from high above but the leap is too great and he does not survive it leaving behind a meta
Continue through the gates into the next venue
This opens withAlice running ahead of a collapsing walkway
She must now move along a series of walkways narrow in places over the lava that seems to underlie much of Wonderland
She will meet several groups of enemies mostly Heart and Spade Card Guards whose explosive missiles can knock her off the pathway into the lava
Try getting as close as possible before they start shooting and toss a Jackbomb making sure it goes near the group and not into the lava
Turn and run to get out of range while the Bomb takes care of them dodging and jumping ndash mdash and being careful not to fall off the pathway ndash mdash then hurry back and gather metas if needed
It may well take more than one Bomb
Alice might successfully employ the same technique using the Jacks or the Demon Dice realizing that the Dice Demons are not always victorious
Knife throwing can come in handy as well as the Ice Wand if she can get close enough
Even the Blunderbuss is appropriate if she meets a lone persistent Guard and has time to wait for the Will meter to recharge
Fortunately there are some Heart Metas along the path should the Sensitivity or Will meters run low
It is a long path but eventuallyAlice will pass into the next venue on her way to a confrontation with the Queen of Hearts
Another abrupt change in surroundings in whichAlice now has to jump and teeter her way among huge rocks and across girders
Proceed into the rocks to the top of a green pedestal on the right and leap to a ledge on which there is a black stain
In order to avoid a Card Guard attack run up the beam and climb to the ledge then go right to hide behind the red pillar
Step out throw Jacks or knife get right back and hide again
Repeat as often as necessary to take care of both Guards
Proceed to the ledge where the guards were
Go under the beam and down to the left where a tunnel entrance will be found at the exit of which three Guards attack but they are readily taken care of in a bunch with the Ice Wand
Cross a ribcage bridge and into another tunnel climb out of that and back among the rocks again
Here there is only one path that may be followed jumping as required and overcoming enemies and Alice will shortly come to a cave in the rocks at the end of which E is a series of mostly vertical passages inside a structure of red blocks
Jump climb to the left to a vent of rising vapor
Before riding it upward go forward and left and look up to the right to see a Heart Card Guard waiting she should be able to eliminate him with the Jacks
Ride the vapors up to where the Guard was
Around the corner is another vapor column and below the ledge is another Guard who is a client for the Jacks or he may be waiting around that corner in which case use the Wand
Ride this new vapor column way up untilAlice can get off at a ledge where there is a Small Will then jump climb the wall at the left
Go around the corner and she can make a long jump down to a paved area on which are two metas and a wide roadway leading left to the Queen rsquo s castle gates before which are two Heart Card Guards
Once more the Ice Wand will take care of them as she approaches the gates
WhenAlice gets close to the gates they will slide open
Inside the revealed entry hall is a phalanx of Card Guards to preventAlicefrom passing through and after a moment the guards begin shooting their bombs
One thing that might be tried is tossing in one of the weapons and then quickly backing off whereupon the doors close again and she waits a bit for the weapon to do its damage then repeat
Be sure and wait long enough if the Demon Dice are used
Another procedure is to toss a weapon then run for a corner on either side of the gate where she will be shielded from the guards
They do not leave their stations and come out
Do this from both sides of the gate
It may take a while but eventually they will be cleared out
A Grasshopper Tea will crawl out through the doors but if you decide to gather it up you will most likely find thatAlice moves far too fast for effective control
You can try
However none of this fighting has to be done though it might be a fun challenge
As soon as the gates open invoke the Dead Time Watch and run up the ramp around the obstacle ledge that is across it continuing upward through a couple openings to the top and down the other side
WhatAliceis looking for is a prominent brown rectangle with the corners removed this is an elevator and when she hops onto it she will rise up to another venue
The elevator stops in a huge hall with very little in it but columns and space and double doors at one end
Pass through these doors into another hall this one with a little more in it
Be warned now at the beginning of this venue that there are numerous Heart Card Guards herein some visible at a distance some popping up asAlice turns a corner or opens a door
All of them are vulnerable to the Ice Wand so have her carry it at all times
Go down a ramp into a central depressed area where on the walls are three portraits mdash caricatures really mdash of foes with whomAlice has had running battles a Tweedle the Jabberwock and the Mad Hatter
In the center is a pedestal mirror that may be rotated but not here
Return up the ramp and go around the hall to the doors on the opposite end from those through which she entered and which she will find to be locked
These doors lead to the Red Queen rsquo s throne room
HereAlice will find on the rim of the depression one of the familiar floor levers
Pull it to observe the mirror pedestal rotate stopping when it is positioned to reflect the Tweedle
Go down to check this out
Strangely what is actually seen in the mirror is not the Tweedle picture but a club image
Now begins a series in which Alice does much moving between rooms in order to unlock the throne room doors
Go back to the elevator room and cross it to find doorways at the other side leading to a vapor vent thatAlice can use to rise to a ledge one level up
When she gets off the vent she is facing doors with a club over them and passageways to the left and right
Since a club was seen in the mirror enter these doors
Move forward into the spotlight whereupon the room lights up and copies of the three portraits are revealed
Select the Tweedle by throwing the knife at it and shortly the room goes dark once more
Remember to haveAliceselect the Ice Wand again as she will encounter more Card Guards
Leave the room jump to the lower floor next to the vent and return to the floor lever
Pull it again and go down to note that the mirror is now positioned to reflect the Jabberwock but that a diamond is seen
Go again to the vent and go right after she gets off andAlice will come to doors with a diamond over them
Inside use the knife to select the Jabberwock picture then return again to the floor lever
This time when she pulls it and goes down to the mirror as may be anticipated the Hatter is not reflected but a spade is
Go left after riding the vent to the spade room and now whenAlice knifes the Hatter picture a cutscene shows the throne room doors opening
When she goes there that is indeed the case but beyond them is yet another pair of double doors
Go toward them and when she is near a cutscene begins with the Cheshire Cat lecturing and warning Alice but he never finishes because as he is talking the doors slowly open behind him and a blast of something blows his head off
Once more Alice is overcome with grief and she is then propelled through the doors into the presence of the Red Queen
Move toward the throne to be introduced to the Queen
She must really be seen rather than described but she is a several tentacled grotesque being that moves about on a very long supple arm extending far from the throne
She has numerous attack powers many of which are those of the enemies that have been encountered and several in addition all in differing degrees of effectiveness
She is not your everyday queen
InAlice rsquo s battle with the Queen her defense is as before to keep running dodging and jumping
She can hide behind pillars mdash the two nearest the door have metas that keep regenerating mdash but even when hiding she is vulnerable to a force of attraction that the Queen can generate and which she uses to slam Alice against a wall or to draw her in and gnaw on her
When this force is used Alice is surrounded by orange sparkles a cloud of blue sparkles and also a faint sound like a telephone ringing is a warning that the orange ones are coming and she must move to avoid them but in practice the orange follows so quickly on the blue that unless Alice is already moving she will be caught
The Queen employs this force far too often
The only weapons to be used in fighting the Queen are the Jabberwock Eye Staff and the Blunderbuss
With the Eye Staff hold down the left mouse button producing some blue sparkles easily confused with the above warning ones and shortly a beam will emanate from the Staff as long as the button is held
Keep the beam trained on the Queen as she moves and she will flinch and cry out each time it registers but you must watch the blue Will meter as it will be draining so as it gets low you will have to abandon the attack and run to the metas behind the pillars the hits you have made on the Queen are not lost
The Blunderbuss is more effective but empties the Will meter with one shot and must be carefully aimed because there is a detectable delay between the time of trigger pull and when the musket ball reaches the enemy difficult with a moving target
However ifAlice is a good shot and can keep going until the Will meter is recharged a couple hits should take care of her
Alice just has to keep trying over and over hitting the Queen a few times running to the metas behind the pillars then hitting her some more and with experience she will be able to hit her enough times so that she will be killed after which the long arm will collapse and withdraw into the throne
However that is not the end of the fighting
The queen rsquo s place in her throne is replaced by her real head the head rsquo s mouth opens to reveal the Mad Hatter rsquo s head and his mouth in turn opens to showAlice rsquo s head
The latter harangues and threatens Alice for quite a while after which Alice enters a dark place in her subconscious and is confronted by a demon that is presumably her inner self and was engendered by her guilt at escaping the fire while all else perished as related in the game introduction
This psychiatric demon is really what is wrong withAlice rsquo s Wonderland and must be destroyed
In the void of this dark space is a ring of rocks around whichAlicemust keep running and jumping to avoid the blasts of the demon in the center of the ring
The demon has many weapons of course all designed to destroy Alice either by direct hits or blowing her into the void
The demon keeps sinking below the rock ring giving Alice a little respite then rising to attack
There are many large metas on the rocks forAlice to regenerate her Sanity and Will and whenever the latter is complete she should stop on a large rock advance toward the inner edge and fire the Blunderbuss at the center of the demon an easy shot since it does not move much
If she is not near the inner edge or the rock too small the recoil that knocks her down may also knock her off the rock
Then she must be up and running and jumping again
The game may be saved to retain each success
After perhaps five successful shots the demon will fly apart and the concluding video plays wherein many game scenes and personnel are seen andAliceleaves the asylum

GAME BOOMER'S Hints Cheats and Walkthroughs
American McGee's Alice Chapter Village of the DoomedAlice starts the game in the Village of the Damned where the inhabitants redefine quot downtrodden quot
This chapter serves as a nice easy introduction to the game and sets up the story
You must find the Troll Elder and ask him for his help Level DementiaThis is an extremely straight forward level that gets you used to controling our heroine and mastering a few of her basic moves
You'll find next to no danger here but a careless step or complete incompetence in battle could get you killed I suppose Simply follow the cave walkways and planks talking to the trolls as you go
You'll pick up a Vorpal Blade then see the White Rabbit shrink down and go through his door
You'll have to find a way to make yourself small to follow him Near where the White Rabbit went through the door you'll fight a Card Guard Keep following the cave until you come to an area with several planks running up and down
Climb up the ledge to your left then up the ramp and talk to the Troll
Follow the plank to your left again and notice where the Cheshire Cat is perched when he appears
Jump down to that ledge and exit the level Level PandemoniumThe beginning of this level will test your skill with climbing and swinging from ropes
Jump onto the nearest rope then swing back and forth until you can jump to the opposite ledge
Run down and talk to the Village Elder
He'll tell you that you must retrieve some items for him before he'll help you Proceed through the mine entrance near the Elder and take a ride on the mine cart
Once done kill the CG and grab the Playing Cards
Go through the door to your right and clear out the guard compound
Grab the key from the table then climb the nearby stairs and go through the portal This will open another portal in the area but will also force you to defeat several more CG's
Make your way to the second portal and go through
The Elder will take you to your next destination
You will have to use the key to free the Elder's companions Chapter Fortress of DoorsWith a little help from the Troll Elder Alice is off on the next leg of her journey
In order to follow the Rabbit you'll need to become very small
The Elder can help but he'll need your help in finding the recipe for a special potion then gathering the ingredients
All of these can be found in the Fortress of Doors and the Skool House but it won't be easy Level Fortress of DoorsGo through the door straight ahead and to your right at the beginning of this level
Ignore the Card Guards overhead now and proceed to the gate in the wall to the right In the next room kill the Boojums and watch out for the floor when it splits asunder
Jump to the opposite side then climb the stairs and run across the see saw piece of floor floating between the two balconies
Balance the piece by standing on the far end to make it tilt then run to the other end while it's high in the air and jump to the other side Level Beyond the WallWalk forward into the maze of columns killing any Card Guards's that appear
You can grab the Rage Box from the pedestal if you like as it will make things much easier
Once done find the door at the back of the mazeGoing through the doors will bring you to a checkerboard area where a great tempest swirls around you and sections of the floor flip in and out of place
Time your movements across the floor sections to get to the other side Note the short cut scene where the three doors close each one playing a note
Note the notes heh and the order in which they are played Low high medium This corresponds to a puzzle in the next room
There is one lever on the upper floor of this area and three in the lower
Pulling one of the trio of levers will produce a note
The trick is to pull the three downstairs levers so that they reproduce the tunes you hear when the three doors are locked
Pulling the lever on the upper floor resets the puzzle The correct order is right left middle or low high medium tones Once done cross the chasm by walking across the flipping tiles and kill the Card Guards's on the other side
Go through the portal In the next room floor pieces rearrange themselves then move up and down
Kill all enemies in this area then climb the moving floor pieces to the exit above
While you're at it though turn around and check out the mural above the portal you entered through
It's a chilling foreshadowing of events to come The next room contains three doors that periodically shuffle themselves around
Defeat the enemies in the area
If you fall into the pit below ride one of the bobbing pillars up
Once done watch for the door that is green go through it Level Return to the Fortress of Doors You'll now be on the top of the Fortress's outer wall
Kill any enemies then run around to the opposite part of the wall
Jump from he wall to the open door in the Skool House Level Skool DazeGo through the doors ignoring any Insane Children you come across
Clear the entryway of enemies then grab the Croquet Mallet
Once done go through the double doors to the left of the fireplace and meet with the Troll Elder again
He'll explain that you need to retrieve the Book of Bizarre Things from the library so that he can look up the recipe for making you small Once done talking to him clear out the Card Guards's then proceed to the library which on the second level of the entryway
The trick here is to find the four glowing blue books and touch them
Each one you touch will fly away and form a segment of a bridge leading to the Book of Bizarre Things
Find all the blue books then reach the magical tome at the top of the library
You will have to fight many foes along the way Once you get the book go back to the library floor to get the recipe and exit the level Level Skool's OutIn this next level you get your first chance to pick up the Demon Dice
Find the exit to your left
This will take you to a room where the Dice hare sitting on a segment of floor hovering in space
Grab it but be ready for a fight with Boojums that will be very difficult
Their scream will likely knock you off the edge so be ready Once done go through the door marked quot st Grayd quot on the lowermost level
Make your way to the gymnasium then pull the lever in the alcove
Once the bleachers are out use them to climb the rafters and meet with the Troll Elder
When you are attacked by Boojums grab the Rage Box and clear them out
It's then time to catch up with the Elder again
Go back out into the entryway and climb the stairs to the second level
Go through the door marked quot nd Grayd quot
Help the Elder out then get the scoop on the recipe
You now must go and get some Poppy Blooms to finish the potion
Grab the flask from the cupboard and head out To get to the quot Third Grayd quot where the Poppy Blooms wait go through one of the side doors outside the lab
This will teleport you up to the next level
Go through the rd Grayd door and clear out the enemies
Grab the Lolly Pop and return to the laboratory so that the Elder can finish the potion You will now be ready to follow the White Rabbit's trail but you must take a short cut through the Observatory which was previously inaccessible
The Elder will give you a gold star that will unlock the room so grab it AND the quot drink me quot potion sitting on the table
Doing so will open a portal that will exit the levelLevel More Skool DazeAt the start of this level you will return to the Skool entryway
Return to the library via the second story doorway fight off any enemies you encounter then find the entrance to the Observatory on the third floor
Enter and use the Gold Star to ride the elevator up
Once in the Observatory clear out any enemies then walk up to the telescope on the balcony
Alice will drink the potion and jump through the tiny portal to enter the next area Chapter Vale of TearsNow that you're itty bitty you're free to pursue the White Rabbit and find out what's going on in Wonderland
The Rabbit has a head start on you though and catching up with him will be difficult
These woods are full of dangers and the Vale is still filled with the river of tears from your last visit Level Pool of TearsThe Army Ants way up on the cliff will start off by blocking your pursuit of the White Rabbit
Climb up the cliff side avoiding the boulders as you go until you get to the top and teach them a lesson
Note that there is a large Sanity Shard hidden behind the waterfall on the second tier of cliffs
Follow the river upstream until you encounter the Mock Turtle
He'll agree to help you find the Rabbit in exchange for a favor
Seems the Duchess has stolen his shell and he wants it back You must now ride the river downstream using the falling leaves as rafts
There are many tricks along the way such as jumping over branches surviving waterfalls and avoiding enemies
Do your best not to fall in the water lest you be snark bait
If you do fall in get out immediately and wait for the next leaf to come by After you drop down the waterfall take out the Ants then skip across the lily pads to the next leaf
Make your way downstream then jump off to the bank on the right just before going over the waterfall
Drop down to the ground below and on to the next leaf Again go down the river and again avoid going over the waterfall just past where you see the Mock Turtle disembark going over the falls is fatal
Climb up the ledge to the left of the falls and follow the Turtle
Once again jump on the leaf raft and follow him down the river
This time when you come to a waterfall the level will change Level Hollow HideawayFollow the riverbank until you come to a pond with a few lily pads
Jump across them to the tree root then to the other bank
Follow this bank around until you can jump on a leaf
Ride it down the pond a little bit until it drops you off on the other side
Run along the bank and clear the area of enemies There is a Killer Mushroom here guarding a large Sanity Shard
Don' try to get the shard until the area is cleared of Ants and Blood Roses
Otherwise you might have more than you can handle Follow the path until you come to a Blood Rose guarding a large Sanity Shard
Defeat it then look down the slope to the right for another leaf raft
Board it
Ride the leaf until you see the Duchess's card hose on your right
Defeat the guards then talk to Bill McGille This level is basically one big fight with the Duchess
Once you grab the Jackbomb from the table in her kitchen she'll appear and try to eat you The Duchess is annoying since she can turn to a cloud of pepper and evade most of your ranged attacks and going toe to toe with her is a bad idea
The best way to deal with the Duchess is to use the Jackbomb
Run away from her and drop the bomb at your own feet and keep running
She'll run straight into it
If you get low on health grab any of the Sanity Shards that you can find on your opponent's shelves Once she's dead Bill and the Mock Turtle will join you and the Turtle will reward you Level Wholly Morel GroundThis whole level is pretty straight forward if difficult at times
In order to avoid drowning stay close to the Mock Turtle's bubble trail
The bubbles provide you with air The only things to watch out for here are Snarks which can be nasty if you ignore them
If you take a moment to fight them off be careful of losing the Mock Turtle though for if you stray far from his bubble trail you're doomed Other dangers include clams that can trap you and bubble jets that can push you into sharp spikes
Be wary of both Once you reach the end of the level the Mock Turtle makes you an quot honorary reptile quot and gives you the magic of his shell
The shell will enable you to stay underwater for longer without drowning Chapter Wonderland WoodsThe Rabbit is now at your side or soon will be and it's time to find out why things have gone so badly as of late
The Caterpillar is the wisest creature in Wonderland and he has the answers you need to know
Finding him isn't going to be easy though
You're not out of the woods yet pardon the pun Level Dry LandingYou must now continue your quest for the Caterpillar who is the only one who might be able to help you track down the White Rabbit
Follow the path to your right until you come to a pond
Jump onto the lily pad then across to the next then up the rope
Run around the path behind the waterfall until you come to a ledge guarded by a Blood Rose
Climb up the ledge to your left then use the glowing mushroom to bounce up to the hanging rope
Climb it up then jump onto the ledge overhead where the White Rabbit awaits Follow Rabbit down the cliff side ahead of you
Go from the fungus growing out of the tree's side to the rope then to the ledge guarded by the Army Ant
From there follow the path
You will eventually come to a great pit with several glowing mushroom caps below
Drop down onto the ledge
then use the mushrooms to bounce to the other cliff side
From there climb up the next rope and use some more mushroom caps to bounce up inside the dead tree Follow the path until you come to a narrow bridge in front of a Blood Rose
The bridge will collapse forcing you to use the bouncing mushrooms once again to get to the other side
Ignore the Jackbomb next to the Killer Mushroom and instead follow the path to the right
You will come to more ropes hanging in front of the giant tree
Jump to the rope then to the fungus growing out of the tree
From there jump to the next vine and climb it up to the ledge overhead watch out for enemies above though Follow the riverbank until you come to a path leading out of this level and into the next Level Herbaceous BorderThis level starts out with the White Rabbit meeting an unfortunate end at the hands or rather foot of a mysterious foe
Once you're done grieving speed through the clearing and drop down the hole on the other side Go down the tunnel until you come to a pair of geysers spitting out jets of hot air
Clear the level above of any enemies then ride the jets up to the tunnel above
When the path splits go to the left
When the bridge crumbles jump to the bouncing mushroom to the lower left and ride up to the ledge above
Follow the bridgeways and tunnels out
You'll come to an area where you have to ride several more air jets across a large chasm
Ride the jet up until you can jump to the rope
Go from that rope to the next then climb up it to the ledge overhead Jump over to where the cards are then run up the tunnel to exit the tunnels
Follow the path around to the left then jump across to the vine hanging down from the tree
From there follow the path until you come to another hole in the ground
Jump in and follow the tunnel Level Rolling StonesThis level will start off with the Ladybugs dropping a giant marble down the tunnel after you
From there it's a race against the marble
You can't stop for any period of time or you'll get squished
The first really sticky point you come to is a large chasm
Use the bouncing mushrooms to get across to the tunnel on the far side
But don't stop
The marble will keep coming
The next chasm is connected by the bones of some creature so don't hesitate to run across
Soon you will come to a large ice sheet
Don't hesitate at all and jump at the last second to keep from falling through
On the other side of the ice patch you'll fall through a hole in the ground and start the next level Level Icy ReceptionFollow the path until you come to a deep chasm with ice bridges and rocks
Go to the right and grab the Ice Wand on the ledge below
Be careful in this area though for many of the surfaces are slick and may send you sliding to your doom Follow the path watching for the collapsing bridge until you climb up the rocks next to the frozen Army Ant
Continue to climb the rocks until you come back to where you started the level
Go back to were you jumped down to grab the Ice Wand but instead of jumping down to the left jump down to the right to the blue ledge It'll now be another race against the marble
Follow the tunnel until it exits to a area full of fire
Watch out for the marble behind you though Once the coast is clear follow the path to the right until you come to two geysers leading to a far ledge
Ride the air vents up then follow the path to your encounter with the Caterpillar The Caterpillar will explain the situation to you and insist that you must confront the Queen of Hearts
You must now travel to the Centipede's lair and nibble from the Mushroom of Life in order to regain your normal size Go through the portal to exit the level and proceed to the next Level Fungiferous FloraYou start off in the middle of a patch of Killer Mushrooms
To avoid them look for the nearby Looking Glass behind a pillar and grab it
You can walk right past the mushrooms while invisible
If you're quick
you can make it through the whole next area without having to fight When you come to a large fallen tree to your left crawl under it through the water to the other side
Clear out the enemies there then follow the path until you come to a great hollow tree
Climb in to get ambushed and enter the Centepede's lair Level Centepede's SantumThis whole level is just a fight with the Centepede
He can attack a number of ways such as nasty melee attacks spitting out smaller centipedes at you and spitting venom The secret to beating him is to attack his vulnerable underbelly
You can only do this when he rears up and gets ready to attack so a good strategy is to dash in close and bait him into a melee attack then back away quickly
When he rears up let loose with a ranged weapon like your Vorpal Blade's secondary attack
Hit him enough times and he'll go down If you need health there's some scattered around the level but your best source are the small centipedes that the boss spits out
One hit with the Cards toy and they go down leaving meta essence behind Once the Centepede is dead climb up the fallen spikes to the mushroom to exit the level Level Caterpillar's PlotThis level has exits to several other parts of Wonderland and you'll be returning here regularly to travel to them
Right now however only one of them will open the Oracle's Grove
But you have to do something first Wipe out the Fire Imps but beware the Magma Men that dwell in the lava pools as well as the Phantasmagoria that lurk about Grab the first part of the Jabberwock Eye Staff from the rock pillar in the middle of the lava pool
You'll need to collect the other piece and the eye before you're done but it's a start
It'll also open up the gateway leading to the Oracle Follow the path fighting through enemies until you come to the cave of the mysterious oracle
He'll tell you that you must defeat the Jabberwock so that you can complete its staff and open the doors to the Queen's final stronghold To get the next piece of the staff you'll have to enlist the help of the quot Pale Royals quot or the White King and Queen
After your conversation with the Oracle is over the doorway to the Pale Realm will open
Backtrack to it just off of the area where you found the first piece of the staff You can fight your way through the chess pieces and Card Guards but there's a much easier way
There's a Looking Glass hidden underneath one of the tiles near where the checkerboard pattern starts
Grab it and simply run past your foes
Enter the portal to go to the next area Chapter Looking Glass LandYou'll spend much of this level going through the chess villages
The eternal battle between the White and Red sides is going on all around you so watch your step
The White chess pieces are friendly while the Red are not Level Pale RealmStart the level by talking to the White Bishop
This will transform you into a bishop chess piece
You will only be able to move diagonally on the chessboard floor and must navigate the next area without falling into a pit or being killed by spikes Once through walk into the next area
Here you must defeat several chess pieces the Jackbomb works very well against chess pieces then head through one of the doors This will take you to a room with an elevator which will take you to a balcony where there are spikes jutting up out of the floor
Time your movements right to bypass the spikes and get to the next area where you will have to defeat a pair of Red Bishops Follow the path going through doors as needed into the large structure and up some stairs until you find a lever on a small balcony
Pulling the lever will open the doors next to the White Rook
Backtrack down to the courtyard and go through the doors Fight more chess pieces and follow the path until you come to a White Knight that transforms you into a chess piece of the same type
This time you can only move in quot L quot shapes so navigating your way through the maze is a little more tricky
You can still do it relatively easily though Walk up the stairs to your right and go through the smaller white door to the inside of the building on your right
Go up the stairs then out the door at the top
Cross the walkways to a guard house with a lever
Throw the lever to raise the water levels below With the higher water you will now be able to swim to a place nearby that you couldn't reach before
Dive into the water and find the ledge there will be two Red Pawns nearby climb up and go through the double doors to the next level Level CastlingWalk forward and through the doors then towards the large gate on your right
This will trigger a cut scene where the White Queen is captured
Fight off the chess pieces then go through the castle doors Fight off the Red chess pieces then follow the hallway until you come to a throne chamber
Here you will talk to the White King who will charge you with rescuing the White Queen and taking a Pawn with you to the Red Chess land Once he's done talking follow either of the two Rooks who will lead you to a newly opened portal
Go through to enter the next area Level Checkmate in RedThis level is much like the White chessboard village except that it's in white and red instead and black and white
There will be plenty of Red chess pieces to slay Start off by running straight forward and diving into the water
Swim around and look for an area with several Sanity Shards and a bubble jet
Swim through this area then up to a small alcove with a rope
Climb the rope up Run across the walkways until you come to a small house with a door you can walk through
Go in and make your way to the alley out back
Here you'll witness the execution of the White Queen how morbid
But don't worry all is not lost Follow the alleyways through several Chess Pieces until you come to an ornate set of double doors guarded by two Rooks
Go through the doors then drop down through the hole in the ground
You will then come to a drawbridge leading to a large chess board where you must battle the Red King The Red King isn't that difficult to defeat
He can attack by swinging his scepter or with a laser attack
Use the Ice Wand on him and keep moving
His attacks don't do that much damage if you keep moving and if you need health you can scoop it up from where it regenerates around the edge of the map
Just keep moving and keep moving Once the King is defeated you can drop the White Pawn down which will turn into a White Queen remember that rule from chess
Unfortunately you don't get to witness the ass whooping the White Queen gives to the rest of the red chess pieces as the Mad Hatter makes and appearance and knocks you unconscious You'll start the next level in his clutches Chapter Mirror ImageStart off the level by turning right and following the twisted hallway into the mirror maze
If you like you can grab the Rage Box by jumping up onto the wooden quot ceiling quot beam next to the wall and climbing up to the perch Keep following the hallways watching for ambushes until you come to an area where one of the mirrors is cracked and there's some machinery exposed behind it
Throw your knife at the clock you find there
This will open up a passage on the other side of the glass Turn back around and continue to follow the mirror hallways until you come to a giant tube suspended in place this will only appear if you destroy the clock
After you grab the nearby Jacks opposite the pipe go through the pipe to the next part of the level In this area you will have to watch out for Nightmare Spiders which like to pounce on you from above once you come close enough
Unfortunately they're invulnerable until they pounce so you'll have to duke it out The trick in this next area is to destroy all the clocks pumping gas into the Insane Children's rooms
Only after you've destroyed all the clocks will the large doorway leading out of this area open up
Go around and destroy the clocks
Note that you must also go back through the pipe which has now swung around in a different direction to access several other cells Once the pipe breaks and the outer door is open head through the double set of double doors to the area with pieces of a clock face floating in space
Watch the platforms here as they will tilt wildly and dump you off into space if the Boojums don't knock you off themselves
Make your way to the top and go through the outer double doors Run along the walkway next to all the machinery being careful to avoid getting blown off by the strong gusts of wind
To your right you should see three giant rings hanging from the ceiling by cables
Make your way over to these and jump through them Walk along the path and go through the double doors
Here you will face Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum
Both can pack quite a punch with either swords or grenades and both can drop down on top of you for big damage
Worst of all they can spawn smaller versions of themselves that have the same attacks Concentrate first on the smaller one main boss first ignoring the creatures they spawn in if you can
If you need health defeat some of the quot mini tweedles quot or grab it from where it spawns in on the staircase
Once the smaller tweedle is done for it's easier to concentrate on the larger one
There's no quot trick quot to winning this fight other than knowing which creature to attack After you defeat them the Hatter will show up and whisk you away to the next level Chapter Behind the Looking GlassYou are fully within the Mad Hatter's realm now and things are not pretty
The Hatter is obsessed with time and clockwork and his mechanical creatures are everywhere
This level is also very surreal testing your senses at every turn Level Crazed ClockworkWalk down the clockwork pieces and head for the door on the lower right
Go through then follow the path until you come to a room with toxic water in the middle and hallways to the right and left that lead to levers
Throw both levers to lower a gear over the water
Hop on the gear then ride it around until you can jump to a new area look for the Sanity Shard and the words quot You're Next quot written on the wall Go through the door and follow the path until you come to a room with several clock faces floating in the water
Look at the mirrored wall to see which clock faces will sink when you stop on them and which will not
Jump across to the switch on the other side of the water and throw it
Then run around to the door that it opens and go through You will now be in a long row with more cells
Go straight forward until you come to a room with padded walls on your right
Drop down through the hole in the floor to the area below
From there fight the Nightmare Spiders and follow the path until you come to a set of double doors Go through the double doors and have an encounter with the Mad Hatter's current house guests the March Hare and the Doormouse
You'll also get to see how the Hatter creates his Automotons Once done talking to these two throw the lever next to the large machine
This will open a grateway elsewhere and prompt the Hatter to open the giant key and lock
Backtrack to the newly opened grate it's not far and re enter the long hallway full of cells
They will now be open however and newly formed Automotons will come out
Once they're clear go back to where the Hatter opened the door with the giant key and go through Follow the path to the next set of double doors and encounter the Griffin
He'll tell you that the Hatter will return at to check his experiments
Once you're done talking go back out through the door and continue following the path
Go through several doors then a green portal Upon going through the portal you'll be on a gigantic tea table with four cups of tea
The trick to exiting this area is to use the seat cushions to bounce onto each teacup then stand on the sugar cube to sink it into the tea
Once all four cubes are sunk the exit will appear
Just be careful that tea is hot Run into the next room and throw the lever in the middle of the floor
This will set the clocks to and prompt the Hatter to appear
Go through the new portal on your right and confront him Level About FaceThis level is one big fight with the Hatter
After you grab the second piece of the Jabberwock's staff he'll appear
The Hatter can attack in a number of deadly ways such as firing rockets swiping you with his cane or throwing toxic tea
There's precious little health on this level so be efficient The best way to beat the hatter is to use a combination of Jacks and either Jackbombs or Ice Wand attacks
Hit him with the Jacks then go after him with another weapon
You should also do your best to circle strafe the Hatter run circles around him so that he can't get a good track on you Every once in a while the clock bells will ring and the Hatter will leave the battle field for a moment
Two Automotons will appear to fight you
Don't waste your ammo on them
Instead run from them jumping to throw off their missiles
When the Hatter reappears after a moment he'll slay the Automotons in the process leaving their Meta Essence for you to take Keep wailing on the Hatter and he'll eventually go down
Using the Jacks in combination with other weapons and circle strafing are your keys to victory Once the Hatter is dead ride the clockwork counterweights up to the exit
Make sure to grab the Dead Time Clock on your way out Chapter Land of Fire and BrimstoneThe Grypon will drop you off in the Land of Fire and Brimstone then leave to rally the troops
You must find your way through the land and confront the Jabberwock so that you can get his eye to complete the Staff
It's unlikely he'll cooperate but it's the only way you can breach the Queen of Heart's defenses level Burning CuriosityWalk forward and take out the pack of Fire Imps that come out to greet you
The Ice Wand works well for this
You'll then have to skip across several rocks poking up out of a pool of lava then climb up the rock face on the other side
At the top of the climb you'll encounter a couple of Jabberspawn
Surprise them and take them out quickly
Jacks combined with Jackbombs or the Ice Wand work well
There's a Rage Box nearby if you need it Go down the hill on the other side of the Jabberspawn and follow the tunnel through or better yet over some lava streams and up the lava river
You'll have quite a trek and have to fight Boojums Fire Imps Fire Snarks and Jabberspawn along the way Eventually you'll empty out into another rocky area
Jump over the gorge and kill of the Phantasmagoria and Fire Imps on the other side
Follow this tunnel until the Oracle speaks to you again and reveals its identity
He'll tell you to confront the Jabberwock immediately
It's the only way that you can save yourself and Wonderland Exit the cave and find yourself looking at a house your house perched atop a giant rock set in a river of lava
Make your way up to the house by jumping up the rocks around it fighting Jabberspawn Fire Imps and Fire Snarks along the way
The pack of Jabberwocks at the top of the stairs is a particular pain and it's best to pick them off from a distance with your Knife or lob a few Jackbombs up to them once you get close enough Once inside the house you're ready to confront the Jabberwock Level Jabberwock's LairThis is your first encounter with the Jabberwock
He talks a mean talk and will do his best to psych Alice out before the fight even starts
This is one of the most important fights in the game and its story as Alice must overcome her own guilt over her parents' death and her inability to prevent it Like other fights one of the keys to winning this one is to keep moving
You've got little room to run and the Jabberwock's fire attack has a decent range
It's very hard to keep from being lit up like a candle
Keep on the move though and you should be able to avoid most of his melee attacks
You'll then only have to worry about his eye beam attack and fire breath But the Jabberwock isn't your only concern
Jabberspawn will periodically join the fray and hamper you
Jabberspawn are actually a good source of meta essence however and will nicely supplement the little that regenerates in the main arena Weapons to use here are the Jacks o' Death combined with either the Jackbomb alternat fire or the Ice Wand
If you need a breather don't forget to use the Deadtime watch
Keep moving and keep hammering on the Jabberwock until he is defeated with a little help from a friend
He won't be dead however and it won't be the last time you face him You will now have the Jabberwock's eye and with it the last piece to the Jabberwock Eye Staff
Grab it and exit through the portal Level Caterpillar's PlotYou will now be returned to the Caterpillar's Plot area
Clear if of enemies then go look at Humpty Dumpty
Notice the small brick protruding from the wall next to him
Press against this brick to open a secret area nearby
Go down the hill towards the grate and look for the opening in the wall on your left
Here you can grab the mighty Blunderbuss Once you have the weapon follow the signs leading to the Magestic Maze
You'll have to fight through several Spade and Heart Card Guards on your way so a roll of the Demon Dice may help Once you come to the wall blocking your path use the Jabberwock Eye Staff on it to open it and grant you passage
Run on through to the next level Chapter Queen of HeartslandYou're now deep into the Queen's territory and things will start to get pretty difficult from here
The most elite of the Queen's forces now blocks your path and taking them out can be difficult
The Spade and Heart Card Guards have deadly projectiles that can knock you into further danger so be wary Level Majestic MazeThis maze can be a nightmare if your combat skills aren't up to snuff
You will constantly be ambushed by Card Guards and Jabberspawn so be ready to fight
The Jacks and Jackbomb combination are really necessary here What you want to find is the red portal
Head to your right and follow the path until you come to it
You can't go through it but with the portal on your right follow the path down into the next area
You'll know you're on the right path if you go through a deep archway shaped like a heart Follow the tunnel around until you come to a large green portal next to a smaller one
An Insane Child will run through the smaller portal triggering a gate to close in front of the larger one
Whenever you step on the pressure platform on the left the gates open but when you step off it they close There are a number of possible solutions to this puzzle
The easiest is to stand on the pressure plate then use the Dead Time Watch to freeze time and stroll through the open gates
This is the recommended method simply wait a few minutes if you need to quot recharge quot your watch The second solution is to throw the Demon Dice onto the pressure plate and have the summoned demon trigger it while you dash through the portal The third solution is to lure one of the enemies Card Guard or Jabberspawn onto the pressure plate then run for the gates when they trigger it
Tough to do Level Airborne TerrorThis level is straight forward if not difficult for those that haven't mastered riding air columns
Simply float up the successive thermal drafts to the next highest level repeating until you reach the end of the map
Watch out for Boojums though as they will do their best to knock you to your death with their powerful screams I recommend saving your game often here as one small mistake can send you to your death
If you just can't get the hang of this level and get too frustrated many gamers can't stand this type of stuff check out the cheats section for instructions on how to use the quot noclip quot cheat Level Mystifying MadnessThis is another very combat intensive level so be ready
Don't be afraid to use your Dead Time Watch if things get out of hand or if you want to bypass a particular group of enemies
You'll fight more Card Guards Jabberspawn and Boojums than I care to mention here Go up the stairs and follow the path to the right until you find a square hole in the ground filled with water
Dive in and swim down to your right
You'll know you're going the right direction if you see a couple of bubble jets
Swim down through the tunnel and come up in an underground cave
There will be a ledge behind a large rock next to a few Sanity Shards where you can climb out of the water
Do so and jump across the rocks to the platform on the other side of the cave
Don't miss the large Sanity Shard if you need it Follow the hallway with the grated floor going straight when it forks at the strange spider like machine
Throw the switch at the end of the hallway
This will open up a part of the underwater tunnel but will also loose two Automotons on you and block your return path
Take out the Automotons then go through the hallway opposite the spider machine Go up the spiral stairs follow the hall and drop down into the water
Turn around and swim through the caves until you come to the large underground cave again
This time swim through the underwater tunnel then up the well to the upper level You will now be on the walkways above the maze area where you started the level
Don't drop back down yet
Run along the maze ignoring Guards for the moment if you can
Keep taking left turns until you find the Looking Glass powerup
Grab it to make yourself invisible Turn around and follow the maze taking your first left
Keep following this path until you come to an alcove with a lever
Throwing the lever unlocks the portal below granting you exit from this map
Turn around and take your first right dropping down to the lower levels
Follow the hallway to the exit
If you still have a charge on your Dead Time Watch then this is a good time to use it Level Water LoggedThis level is full of water and your goal will be to make it fuller
There are several pipe lids attached to bobbers throughout the level
Raising the water level will raise the bobbers and open the lids granting you access to the pipes
There aren't even any enemies on this level besides Snarks Walk through the hallway to your right then dive into the water and swim straight ahead killing Snarks as you go
Swim under the floor to a small section in the back of the room that opens up to dry land
Climb out of the water then climb up the ledges and jump on the small metal platform hanging form the ceiling This will raise the water level in the room raising one of the bobbers and granting you access to the pipe
Swim down it through the holes in the grating and through the tunnel
Pass through the bubbles to regain breath and be wary of the turbines that can suck you in and chop you up Swim up the long pipe to another room with another metal platform hanging from the ceiling
Jump on it just like before and find the new pipe that this opens straight ahead beyond the first one
Swim down and through the pipes making sure to go for the bubbles when you need them and avoiding the fans
At the end of the pipe you'll have to pass through a broken turbine so be careful Once out of the pipe climb up and activate the last platform to flood the room some more
Run through the structure in the middle of the room and dive down into the water after grabbing the large Sanity Shard
Swim out to the first room then into the last pipe and through the portal Level Labarynthine RevengeOh joy
More mazes
This level will contain lots of enemies of various types plus another maze
But this time it's a maze of machine pieces levers and gears that you'll have to navigate through
There will be a lot of tricky jumping involved at this point so best to save often Start off by turning around and riding down the gear pieces to the bottom area with the lava and machine pieces
Ride the moving piece around to the gear in the middle of the poop then jump from there to the far ledge
Keep jumping along the gear teeth until you come to a hallway leading inside the castle You will then come to a large turbine being driven by steam coming up out of the floor
Run to the top of the ramp and time your movement across the turbine face to get to the hallway on the other side Follow the hallway and jump through the holes in the two massive gears blocking your path being careful not to get blown off the side of the walkway by the steam blasts
Continue to follow the hallways fighting enemies as you go until you pass a great water powered machine and a whirlpool
Going out the nearby door takes you to a small hedge maze where you must fight more foes This is a good time to use the Dead Time Watch to bypass a lot of needless battles
Use the Watch and run through the pathway following it until you go back inside When you come back inside you'll find your path blocked by two giant gears and some steam blasts
This is tricky but you have to walk between the teeth of the gears as they come down onto the walkway timing your movements so you avoid the steam blasts After you've made it past this continue following the hallways until you come to a room with a lava floor and a giant gear rotating in the middle
The trick here is to jump onto the gear then jump onto the nearby steam blasts to ride them up to the upper levels
Make sure to take out the Boojum first else you'll get knocked into the lava Once at the upper ledge kill the enemies then ride the steam vents up to the next rotating gear
From there jump to the hallway on your right
Follow this hall until you come to yet another giant gear mechanism
Jump onto the horizontal gear then stand on one of its teeth to ride it around to the other side of the wall
Kill the Card Guard quickly then jump onto the platform and go through the doorway You should now find yourself back in the outside hedge maze area
Follow the path until you come to a courtyard with a statue of the Cheshire Cat and two great heart shaped blades blocking your path
Time your movements to run through the hallway while avoiding the blades then follow the hallways The next challenge you'll come to is another set of steam vents leading up to a balcony high overhead
Ride them up just like you normally do At the top follow the hallway and squirm through some more gears
The exit is just beyond Level MachinationsMore gears
This is another straight forward yet potentially difficult level
You have to jump onto the various machine parts and ride them up to the next machine part and ride that to the next to the next to the next and so on One tip I do have for this level is to remember to use your Deadtime Watch when the gears are lined up correctly for a jump
This will make the jump much easier especially the crazy ones where you have to jump to a rope from a moving platform Other than this there's no big secret to beating this level
Look for ways to ride gears up and save often
Again if you really can't stand this sort of thing check out the cheats section on how to get past it pain free At the end of this level ready your Blunderbuss
You'll want it to immediately be available at the beginning of the next Chapter QueenslandThis is it
You're making your assault on the Queen's final stronghold with the aid of your allies
This chapter starts with an epic battle between the Gripphon and the Jabberwock
Unfortunately the Gripphon ultimately isn't a match for the beast and falls Level Royal RageThis level starts off with a bang as you must battle the Jabberwock again
This time he's not pulling any punches and he's even tougher to beat despite the lack of one of his eyes
He can attack with fire and eye beam attack in addition to his devastating melee attacks
Even worse he often takes to the air and attacks from above making him harder to hit
Start off by nailing the sucker with a Blunderbuss then running for meta essence
After the Blunderbuss use the Jacks o' Death and the Jabberwock Eye Staff combination against this monstrosity and remember to keep moving
Meta essence is scarce here so make every bit count
Avoid attacking the Jabberwock while he's in the air and instead run from his fire attacks
When he's on the ground hit him hard
Once you injure him enough he won't be able to fly any more Again there's no quot secret quot to beating the Jabberwock just keep pounding away and use the Jacks Staff combination
It's tough but it's definitely possible Once you're done say goodbye to Griffon and go through the Castle gates Level Battle RoyaleA major battle boils all around you but your opponent is clear you must find the Queen of Hearts and defeat her
There will be a lot of really tough spots in this level with Card Guards attacking with powerful projectiles from ledges overhead
Don't be afraid to use the Dead Time Watch to get through the tricky parts Run along the pathway and take out the large group of Card Guards that comes out to greet you
An alternate fire Jackbomb combined with the Jabberwock Eye Staff is effective Continue to run along the path fighting enemies as you go
Use the Blunderbuss to take out large groups of Card Guards and scoop up all the meta essence they leave behind
Eventually you'll come to a green rock cave
Go through to reach the next level Level AscensionMore battling against the elite of the Queen's guard in an attempt to breach her castle walls
For the most part this level involves running along ramparts and buttresses finding your way into the castle walls
It's very linear and there are only a couple of tricky parts Again don't hesitate to use your Dead Time Watch to freeze the action if a particular obstacle is giving you trouble
At the start of the level run along the path and jump over the lava pit
Climb the rocks in front of you then circle around the narrow ledge to a shelf guarded by two Heart Card Guards
Dispose of them then run up the nearby buttress you may want to use your Dead Time Watch to keep a Card Guard from overhead from knocking you off the ledge Continue climbing up the buttresses until you reach the top
Behind one of the supporting beams there will be a tunnel consisting of the red fleshy material yuck
Drop down into it and follow it The path eventually takes you back outside with a bunch of Fire Imps
Kill them then follow the narrow stone ledge around to another buttress
Climb it then jump across to the ledge on the other side
Follow the ledge to the left then go through another tunnel guarded by a Jabberspawn and a couple of Boojums Follow this tunnel through several enemies and up to a series of steam jets
Ride the jets up as high as you can then climb your way out of the tunnel
You will find yourself overlooking the drawbridge to the Queen of Hearts' castle
Drop on down clear out the opposition and march on in The inside of the gates will contain several Card Guards as well as some Grasshopper Tea
Grab the Grasshopper as soon as you can and run for the rest of the level
Make your way towards the back of the area and find the elevator that takes you to the next level Level Castle KeepYou will start off in the Queen's foyer
Clear the area of Card Guards then walk through the large doors ahead
This will place you in a room with three portraits The Hatter the Tweedles and the Jabberwock in a sunken pit with a lever on a balcony above it
There is also a mirror in front of the portraits When you pull a lever the mirror rotates to face one of the portraits
The reflection in the mirror however shows a card suit instead of the portrait
These suits correspond to doors that are outside in the main foyer area
The combinations are as follows What you want to do in this area is pull the lever so that the mirror faces one of the portraits then go back out into the foyer ride the air stream up to the balcony and go through the corresponding door look for the card suits above the doors
Once inside you will see three portraits
Throw your knife into the one that you left the mirror facing to shatter it
If you knife the wrong one you'll be teleported back to the foyer and have to fight more Guards Repeat this process for all three portraits
Once you have done this the door behind the switch will open and you will be able to go through
The Cheshire Cat will give you part of an important message then leave you
You must now face the Red Queen alone Level Heart of DarknessWalk forward and approach the Queen's Throne
She'll reveal herself then begin to attack
This is a tricky battle but there are a few things that you can do to make it easier The Queen can attack in a number of ways including missiles beam attacks underground tentacle and an annoying ability to draw you to her self so that she can rend you apart
Each one of these attacks has a unique sound effect associated with it so pay attention
The one that you must learn is the sound associated with her ability to pull you to herself To beat the Queen nail her immediately with the Blunderbuss then run for cover behind one of the farthest two pillars in the back of the room
These will provide you with cover from most of her attacks and will allow you to replenish your meta essence
However it will not protect you from her ability to draw you to her and rip you apart
To avoid this you will need to listen for the sound that comes a second before this attack and run to the other pillar when you hear it Continue to dart from pillar to pillar in this manner replenishing your meta essence until you can hit her with the Blunderbuss again
Repeat until she dies
Save often However the Queen won't really be defeated this first time around
She'll survive your attacks and taunt you a bit before changing form again Level Heart of Darness Part Woah this is going to be difficult
The new Queen is the toughest fight in the whole game and there's no little tricks that you can use to make it easy
She can attack in a number of devastating ways and can easily knock you off your small ledge to your death below The best way to kill her is to use the Blunderbuss right off the bat and then spend the rest of your time running and jumping for the large Sanity Shards that flank her
Once you have enough meta essence hit her again with the Blunderbuss
Repeat until she's dead and remember to save often If you don't have the Blunderbuss yet you can find it on a low ledge next to one of the larger ones nearby
Even if you already have it grabbing it again will completely recharge your meta essence allowing you to get another shot in Once the Queen is dead Alice's mind is whole again in this world and in the real world
She is finally well again and able to put her inner demons to rest
The last we see of her is her leaving the Asylum gates smiling and with a kitten tucked under her arm
The End GAME BOOMER'S Hints Cheats and Walkthroughs
The Lighthouse Quarters Library Laboratory Base Egg Embarkation It was a gray day
The wind was brisk the sky was overcast and full of fat puffy clouds heavy with the moisture of the coming storm
My shoes crunched on the light layer of wind dusted sand blown from the nearby beach as I walked down the narrow lane towards Valembois' lighthouse
The beach was just out of sight but I could hear the surf angry hissing as it attacked the rocky strip of coastline
It's bass voice punctuated the sigh of the wind through the sparse trees and the cries of the few gulls brave enough to try the weather
I heard a clicking from behind and turned to look
It was the postman on his bicycle
He stopped to talk
He had me pegged right off as the journalist
Evidently Valembois had told him of my letters
I listened politely saying nothing until he finished and rode on
I turned my coat collar up against the wind and followed him towards the lighthouse
I had been researching an article on Amerzone
The last time the scientific community had taken notice of it was in the mid thirties
A few people went not much information came back
Alexandre Valembois was the only man left alive I could find who had actually been there
But he was flawed
He'd talked the Museum D'Histoire Naturelle in Paris into financing an expedition there in '
He left in some strange machine he'd invented stayed two years spent a lot of funds and returned with an huge egg
Valembois said it was the egg of a mystical bird that constantly soared the heights around some volcano never touching foot to earth
The Museum said it was an Ostrich egg and an expensive one at that
Valembois' career was ruined his credibility as a zoologist destroyed
It wasn't until after the war that he finally found employment as a natural history teacher in a high school
He was now the only one who could give me first hand information about Amerzone
Maybe if old age and dim memories weren't playing tricks with his sanity
The lighthouse was like a brick fortress built on a square crop of rock surrounded by a wall with a rusty iron gate
The letter the postman had left was hanging out of the mail slot
I put it in my pocket and pushed open the gate
Inside was a small courtyard like area dominated by a huge ancient anchor
I ignored it and walked to the base of the lighthouse pushed open the door and went inside
Living Quarters
There wasn't much on the bottom level just a bicycle and a trapdoor in the floor
I noticed a sledge hammer leaning against the wall near the bicycle
A metal circular staircase twisted upwards
I climbed it

I could hear music as I climbed some dated tune probably from the thirties or forties
It sounded like it was coming from an old record player that had seen better days
I called Valembois' name as I climbed but there was no answer

His living quarters were at the top of the stairs
Across the room Valembois sat at a table
He was wearing a tattered old coat and strangely enough for being indoors an old fedora
You know the kind 's felt inch brim with a velveteen band
Well maybe he was cold
It was damp in that old pile of brick
An ancient gramophone occupied the far left end of the table and announced itself as the source of the music
He was completely unaware of me and sat with his arms spread on the table weight on elbows
His head was slightly downcast and he was nodding like he was falling asleep or very ill
I approached him with the intention of introducing myself and giving him the letter
I never got the chance
Soon as he became aware of me he began his story
A story that was to change both our lives forever
At the end he fell into a coughing fit
He put his head down on his arms like he was going to rest for awhile
That was it
When he didn't move for a few minutes I felt the side of his neck for a pulse
There was none he was gone
The gramophone had stopped and the only sound in the room was the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner

So the egg was alive and he wanted it returned to Amerzone to redeem himself
Suddenly I felt as though I'd gotten way too deep way too fast
If he'd lived I could have politely listened refused and left
But now things were kind of final
I decided there was no harm in doing a little research while I was there

I read the letter I had in my pocket
It was a refusal from the Museum to fund another expedition to Amerzone
They were still smarting from years ago
What the hell
The Museum's phone number was on the letter
I went to the phone on the wall under the staircase and dialed the museum's number
Maybe I could have a little more luck than the old man
No way
After listening to a few minutes of abuse I hung up

To the right of Valembois was a small stand with a picture of a woman on it
It was dated
Not bad if you go for the native type with cheek tattoos and hair styled with a knife
Her name I guess it was her name was written in the corner
I couldn't decipher the handwriting

Behind and right of Valembois was a sideboard
One of the drawers was slightly open
I could see documents inside
One was a personal letter from a David Mackowski an old friend of Valembois in some place called Puebla
In Amerzone
If Valembois was crazy enough to come to Puebla they would meet
But Mackowski was not going adventuring
The other was a polite refusal from the government of Amerzone

I could find nothing else of value in the room
I took the stairs up to the next level
The Library
It was a library of sorts
To the left was a slide projector
I turned it on and it didn't take long to go through the two black and white slides loaded in it
They were taken in the jungle and were both shots of the same woman that was in the photo downstairs

There was also a desk in the room
On the right end was a book open to two facing plates of a species of bird showing a male and a female
On the left was a preservation of the biggest bug I've ever seen
In the center was a journal Valembois had kept while he was in Amerzone
I took the journal and went through it

Things were becoming clear at least now I knew who the girl was
Her name was Yekoumani
Too bad I didn't have Valembois' hydraflot

Far right of the desk was a ladder
I climbed it to a small alcove above the library
There I found a typewritten letter that explained in detail what Valembois wanted me to do
Somehow I must find the egg and the new hydraflot and get to Amerzone
The Laboratory
I went down the ladder back to the library and took the metal stairs up into the laboratory
Nothing much there an old machine that played a scratchy recording of what looked like some South American dictator type Alvarez
giving a speech a drafting table with some sketches of the hydraflot on it a model of the same with a small electric fan that blew across the model when you turned it on
A crude wind tunnel

More promising was the metal door in the right hand wall
It led outside to an iron catwalk that circled the building and a rope and pulley mechanism
By the door was a ladder
I took it up to where the light used to be but found nothing useful there
Time to see where that trapdoor on the main floor went
The Base
Back on the main floor I picked up the sledge near the bicycle and opened the trapdoor
In the dark at the bottom of the stairs I found a switch
I flipped it and a tunnel was illuminated
I followed it to another circular stairway going down

At the bottom was another tunnel
I followed it and just where it started to slope downwards I noticed a narrow doorway off to the right
I was in a hurry to find the end of the tunnel so I ignored the room
My mistake
At the end of the tunnel was a metal door illuminated by a red light
It wouldn't open

I made my way back to the room I'd passed and went in
I found a computer system that looked like an old Mac
On the right hand wall was a double throw knife switch
I pulled it down and was rewarded by the hum of power

The CPU was to the right of the computer table
I turned it on
There was a beep
So far so good
The power switch for the monitor was on the lower right of the monitor case
I switched it on and the screen lit up
It was the Hydraflot operating system

I grabbed the floppy disk to the right of the keyboard and slid it into the slot in the monitor base
The system booted and asked me for a password
Damn
Then I thought perhaps Valembois was as lazy as the rest of us about security
The password was probably something simple he'd never forget like children's birthdays anniversaries or I opened the Amerzone journal there it was on the first page his birthday
I entered the numbers and finished by selecting the star symbol

I selected the square box next to the words Authentication and a screen with a twirling disk came up
I selected load and soon I saw a representation of the door at the end of the tunnel opening

Back at the end of the tunnel I opened the door and stepped through and found myself facing an old fashioned cage type elevator
As I was about to enter the elevator something on the floor to the right caught my eye
It was a key of some sort
I picked it up and entered the elevator

The indicator on the elevator control panel seemed to indicate there were three floors but I could see no way of choosing
I pulled the single lever down and the lift descended with a slight pause when the indicator passed the mark for floor
Curiouser and curiouser

At the bottom was another door that opened easily
Inside was a huge room and in it was the Hydraflot
From the top of the stairs I could see a windowed office to the left
I descended and made my way there

On a small table I found a sketch explaining how to find the egg
Somehow I had to get the elevator to stop at the second floor
I returned to the elevator and went back to the top floor
The Egg
A thorough search of the cage and the surrounding walls revealed a small receptacle on the rear wall of the elevator
It was far down in the right hand corner almost level with the floor
I inserted the key I had found earlier and pulled the control lever

The elevator stopped but there was no door
The wall opposite the control panel seemed to have been patched
I took out the sledge and hammered on the patched spot
A section of wall collapsed
I passed through the hole and walked down the catwalk

At the end was a door
I opened it and there was the egg sitting on a small raised trolley
To the left was a control station
It contained a thermometer which I guessed showed the temperature of the egg and a single lever
I pulled the lever and watched the egg roll out of sight down the rails

I returned to the elevator and pulled the control lever
We went back to the top floor
I removed the key from the receptacle and pulled the lever again and the elevator went down to the Hydraflot level
Embarkation
I went down the stairs
The egg was sitting on its trolley at the rear of the Hydraflot
Now what
I walked past the egg to the right then turned right again
I saw a dim red light burning on the wall next to a ladder
At the top of the ladder I found a lever
I pulled the lever and watched the gantry over the Hydraflot remove the egg from the trolley and lower it into the Hydraflot

At the bottom of the ladder I turned to face the Hydraflot
Along the right side of the machine was a walkway
I followed it down a tunnel with electrical cables and dim lights strung from the ceiling
I soon arrived at a huge wall door

To the right was another tunnel
I followed it to a small lift entered and went up

At the top was a small room with a telescope
As I peered through the telescope I saw a flock of birds flying away into the fog
Large red numerals at the top of the viewing area showed degrees
I remembered that Valembois' journal said he had originally followed the Amerzone Geese
This seemed almost too simple

I returned to the Hydraflot
Time to get real
I had the egg
I had the Hydraflot
If I was serious about fulfilling Valembois' mission now was the time
Inside the cabin I found another computer

I inserted the diskette into the machine picked load and watched it boot up
Soon I saw a menu listing the six modes of operation of the Hydraflot
I picked plane and watched the checklist go by

Then it asked for details
I punched in the heading of the birds I had seen through the telescope then the star symbol
I got a very angry message saying Incoherent Data
So it wasn't that simple

I started going back through the journal for clues
There it was on page to the right of a sketch of the Hydraflot
It was a representation of a flock of birds
A line was drawn through the center of the flock in their direction of travel
At the bottom of the line was a notation degrees
I keyed in then the star symbol again

The screen asked me to confirm the destination whatever it was
I clicked on the confirm box and held my breath
Another checklist went by then the craft started down the rails toward the exit

The cavernous door opened as the craft approached and the Hydraflot followed the rails outside to a ramp
There it rotated to the proper heading and the engine started
Seconds later the jet assisted take off bottle mounted above the cabin fired and flung us into the sky
As the expended JATO bottle was ejected into the sea I felt a pang of regret
I hadn't made any provisions for Valembois' remains
Then sudden panic I also hadn't left word for anyone of where I was going
The Atoll Gasoline Whale Chest Embarkation I soon settled into the routine of the flight
There was no way to know how long it would take but I was confident the Hydraflot would perform
It was all automatic and left nothing for me to do but enjoy the ride and continue going through the journal
Thank you Monsieur Valembois
We flew through the night into the next day
At mid morning my confidence was shattered
Out of gas
The warning light flashed accusingly from the panel
Before I could react the machine went into a glide and bounced down onto the surface of the sea near a small island
Was this the island where Valembois had his fatal collision with the whale
Gasoline
I tried to switch the operational mode to boat
No go
Of course
There was no gas
I tried sailing and watched as the wings deployed as sails and we headed toward the island at a stately three knots
However we soon stopped still well out from the island

I tried the only mode left that the machine would accept submarine
Just before we submerged a huge whale crossed in front of me barely avoiding a collision
Damn
If I wasn't careful I would be repeating Valembois' voyage a little more closely than I wanted
The craft submerged and entered a break in the atoll
There was a wreck jammed into the entrance partially blocking access to the lagoon and as the Hydraflot squeezed through there was a small thump
I had dislodged part of the wreck
The wreckage fell into the opening blocking it
Well I wouldn't be leaving that way
Now I had to find gasoline
There wasn't much change of hitching a ride on a Peruvian whaling ship like Valembois had done

There was an old man fishing from the pier
I tried to talk to the old goat but he was in a foul mood because the fish weren't biting
Evidently there was a sperm whale caught in some old nets in the lagoon and the fish wouldn't bite as long as the whale was around
I took the hint
Unless I got rid of the whale I'd get no information from the old man

A pier led off toward the mainland
I followed it
There was an old hull propped up on the beach
It had been turned into a bar and had what looked like a TV antenna raised above it
Inside on the wall next to the bar was a picture that looked like Valembois' original Hydraflot

On a table at the opposite end of the room was a hardhat diving helmet
At the end of the room was a potbellied stove
Left of the stove tacked to the wall was a faded movie poster ofCasablanca
To the right was a dartboard with a knife stuck in it
I took the knife too
Being a packrat had its uses
You never know when stuff can be handy

I left the bar with my ill gotten gains
Outside I turned right and walked past a windmill
My destination was a small building I had seen on the other side of the lagoon
It looked suspiciously like an aircraft hanger
Maybe I could get some gas there
I smiled as I saw the rusty gas pump in front of the hangar but I had nothing to carry gas in

Inside the hangar was what was left of an old float plane and a radial aircraft engine swinging from a hoist
To my right I found a gas can
Great
At the far end of the building I found a wrench on a workbench

Back outside I filled the can from the pump and returned to the Hydraflot
Mr
Personality was still fishing
The filler pipe for the gas was to the left of the egg
I dumped in the fuel and turned to the computer
None of the modes worked except grapnel
Since the channel was now blocked by the wreck the only way I could leave was by helicopter mode anyway and it wasn't available
There was also another question
Was course good from here or was the atoll where you gassed and changed course
I guessed I was gonna need the old man after all
Time to see about saving the whales
The Whale
The whale was underwater and I did have the hardhat but no oxygen supply
The only place I hadn't explored was the windmill back on the beach
I went back there for a look around

Examination of the windmill and the surrounding machinery proved it was some sort of air pumping mechanism
If I could only get it going
Facing the windmill from the beach side there was some machinery on the right hand side of the foundation
The left side of the foundation led to other machinery in the front of the windmill on the sea side
Closer examination of the machinery on the beach side revealed a D shaped handle hanging down
I pulled it it jerked upwards and the blades of the windmill began turning
Good
We had power even if it was wind power

I walked around the left side of the foundation then turned to face the machinery on that side
There was some sort of a contraption with a lever sticking out of the top
A pipe went from it across the foundation and down into the water
To the right was a reel of air hose
To the left of the contraption I could see what might be a wheel
Closer inspection revealed it was
I turned it

Back in front of the contraption I fastened the air hose to the hardhat took out the wrench and used it on the far end of the pipe where it went down into the water
After that I pulled the lever on top of the contraption
Don't ask me why I did things in that order
It just seemed natural
I picked up the hardhat put it on and entered the deep

I went straight from the windmill foundation out into the lagoon
I found some sort of projection coming up from the sea floor
The end of the net holding the whale captive was snagged on the projection
I cut it loose with the knife and the freed whale wasted no time getting back to sea

I went back to windmill foundation climbed up out of the water and walked back to the pier where the old man was
The Chest
Well well well
The fish were biting and the old goat was talkative
To make it short he remembered three men Valembois and his companions landing in the lagoon sometime in ' or '
They never got their Hydraflot going again
They finally left by ship
Years later the neglected Hydraflot sunk in the lagoon
The old man had a key to a chest they left behind
He gave it to me but never said where the chest was
Further questions were ignored
Time to do a little more exploring

I followed the beach past the windmill and the aircraft hanger
Just past the hanger was the wreckage of a WW military plane
No time to dally
I continued down the beach until I found a path through the cliffs
I followed it to a dilapidated shack
Inside I found the chest
Inside the chest was a computer diskette
Maybe it was setup with the new course and instructions Valembois would have used had the party been able to get the Hydraflot going again

When I exited the shack I saw a faded photograph on the wall near the door
It was dated July and showed the three happy explorers standing with arms around each other
I trudged back to the Hydraflot

Back at the Hydraflot I slipped the disk into the computer and watched it boot
I picked load when the menu came up then helicopter mode
When it asked for details I punched in then star and got the dreaded Incoherent Data message
It seems I wasn't leaving just yet
Embarkation
There seemed only one thing to do taek a look at Valembois' sunken craft
Maybe there was a clue there
I went back to the windmill donned the hardhat and went into the water

I went back to where I had cut the net free and kept going straight
When I got to the wreckage of a plane I turned right
Soon I saw it the submerged wreckage of the original Hydraflot
I couldn't get the cabin door open to get inside
However I thought if Valembois had docked back then where I was now docked my Hydraflot would be directly above
Maybe my Hydraflot's grapnel would be helpful

Once back at the Hydraflot I entered grapnel mode
I pulled the lever to the right of the control panel and the grapnel plunked into the lagoon
Now to go back to the underwater wreck

I discovered I was correct in my assumption
The grapnel now lay next to the wreck
I hooked it to the cabin door and went back to my Hydraflot

I pulled the grapnel lever on the control panel
There was a slight jerk of the Hydraflot as the cabin door below ripped open
Back to the wreck

Inside the wreck I examined the computer
There on the control panel were the numbers
Must be the course to Amerzone from here

I went back to my Hydraflot for what I hoped was the last time
I selected Helicopter mode watched the checklist go by and punched in then star at the details screen confirmed the destination and we were off
Well almost
There was no automatic startup this time
I had to push the lever next to the grapnel lever on the control panel
Puebla Jail Mackowski Embarkation Back on the road again
In my exhilaration I couldn't help but thumb my nose at the old man on the pier as the Hydraflot lifted from the lagoon
At the proper altitude it switched to plane mode and we were off
I was proud of myself
I had beaten the odds on the atoll and was sort of one step ahead of Valembois on the journey
At least I was leaving in the Hydraflot
He left on a Peruvian whaling ship
There was however one small nagging concern
I now knew how far this baby could go on a tank of gas
By mid morning tomorrow I could be repeating my trip to the atoll
If past history was any indication I would not only be looking for more gasoline but a computer disk as well
Sure enough at mid morning of the next day the engine sputtered and died out of gas
I sat helpless and watched as we glided over what looked like a coast line guarded by a fence and watchtowers
It didn't look friendly
My heart came up in my throat as the Hydraflot pulled up at the last minute to clear the fence then glided to a smooth landing in the mouth of a river in the salt marsh just inside the border
I figured to clear the area before anyone from the watchtowers got curious so I switched to sailing mode and the Hydraflot moved up the river
Soon it stopped at a pier jutting out into the current
This was it
Time for more gas and computer diskettes
The Jail
What luck
There was a gas pump on the dock but stupid me I'd left my gas can at the atoll and it didn't look like the hose would reach
There was a stone walkway leading to a gate set in a stone wall
I went to it

It was locked
Just before reaching the gate I'd seen a path leading off to the right
I went back and followed it

It led to a graveyard
There was an ancient priest there praying over a grave
As I approached I looked at the headstone
It was Yekoumani's grave
Poor girl had only lasted a year after Valembois had run out on her
I introduced myself and told the Priest my story
If you can't trust a Priest who can you trust
Turns out he was Father David Mackowski
I had his letter to Valembois
Mackowski had been one of the original three of Valembois' first expedition
He gave me the key to the village gate and told me there was gas for the Hydraflot in the fort and that I had a long way to go
So this was Puebla
At last I was in the Amerzone

I unlocked the gate and entered the village As I crossed the village square and passed the well and the church I had to step around a dead cow laying in the street
At the far end I saw a building on the right with a flag hanging outside
Some official building perhaps
Maybe they could help me
Big mistake

As I approached the building I saw a man on the right side of it
He was a soldier and he very promptly welcomed me to Puebla by giving me the standard whack on the head greeting
I woke up in a cell

There was a cup on the bunk in the cell
Having nothing better to do I picked it up and used it to capture a bug that was high up on the wall to the left of the door

Close examination of the bottom of the door revealed a hole through which I could see a bottle of Tequila
I wasn't going to drink it but maybe someone I knew would
Our of sheer perversity I got out the cup and put the bug into the bottle

Holy smokes
I was just thinking of playing some spiteful juvenile trick on the guard
You know the old bug in the booze trick
When the bug hit the booze there was a eruption of fizzing that threatened to overflow the bottle
It soon calmed down and the tequila appeared normal
The bug was completely dissolved
A black gloved hand reached down and lifted the bottle
I heard drinking sounds then suddenly a body crashed to the ground in front of the hole
I jerked back then reexamined the hole
There was a nice shiny set of keys just outside the hole
I took them naturally

I let myself out
To the right of the mini jail I saw a jeep
It had a jerry can strapped to the back standard world wide jeep accoutrements
I took it and a rope that was in the back
You know my theory on packratting
Father Mackowski
Since the soldier I had taken care of seemed to be alone I decided I had some time and explored the village

The official building I got whacked in front of turned out to be a school
Inside I saw some grade school drawings of some birds
At the front of the class room and to the right was a bust of the fearless leader none other than Antonio Alvarez the third member of Valembois' party
What a bunch they were a zoologist inventor a missionary and a future dictator
There was also a map of Amerzone showing Puebla's relation to the capital city Alvarezopolis
What an original name

The church was locked and the only other building I could get into was the cantina on the right hand side of the square
I missed him at first because it was so dark where he sat in the corner
It was the soldier I had given the cockroach cocktail to
Evidently he'd come around and wandered in here to continue drinking
I thought I ought to leave him alone but decided I could handle him since he was obviously drunk
I tapped him on the shoulder and he went into a drunken ramble about shooting a priest somewhere
Father Mackowski
I hoped not
Time to go
I quietly sneaked out

I had the gas but still needed a diskette
I also had a rope which according to my packrat theory should be useful somewhere
Climb a building
Naw more exciting to go down a well
I went to the well hoping I was guessing right and it hadn't somehow been responsible for the dead cow
I attached the rope and climbed down

I was right
At the bottom was only a tunnel no water
As I stepped into the tunnel I noticed a barred doorway on the left and a statue of a saint in an alcove to the right
I continued to what looked like the end of the tunnel but it merely turned left into the darkness
As I turned left I saw a sword leaning against the doorway
My packrat sense said to pick it up
I did then continued left until I found a ladder

I climbed it and discovered I was in the church and the ladder had come up inside the confessional
Boy I can remember plenty of times where I could have used that
As I approached the alter I saw Father Mackowski
My worst fears were confirmed
He had been shot
He spoke quietly to me for a few minutes then died
Now two of the original three members of Valembois' expedition were dead
Not only that but I had been witness to both their deaths
I hoped this little sequence of events wasn't going to extend to the members of the present expedition
Back to finding the diskette

There was a cupboard behind the altar but it was locked
There had to be a key somewhere
On a stand beside the pulpit was a bible
I opened it
The pages seemed to be blank
I turned some more and came to a place where the pages had been hollowed out and a key hidden inside

The key unlocked the cupboard
Inside was diskette and a letter from the Bishop of Amerzone to Mackowski dated July
So the church and Alvarez had a vested interest in trying to debunk Valembois' theory of the white birds
Embarkation
I went back down the ladder in the confessional
I had a hunch of how to use the sword
My packrat sense was telling me I had an item in my possession that hadn't been used therefore I still had things to do before returning to the Hydraflot

I returned down the tunnel to the alcove of the saint
I took the sword out and placed it in the right hand of the saint then pulled the arm and sword down
There was a grating sound behind me
When I turned I saw the passage had been unblocked
I opened the steel grate went through

The tunnel ended with a ladder
I climbed it and found myself in a small shed
Opening the door I discovered myself back in the graveyard outside the walls

Back at the Hydraflot I emptied the jerry can into the filler pipe
I then inserted diskette into the computer clicked load then glider mode
The journey upriver began
The Journey Upriver Buffaloes Rhinopotamii Pechosaurs Many hours later the Hydraflot stopped at a dilapidated pier
It wasn't out of gas so the reason for stopping was a mystery
I climbed out to investigate
Tricorn Buffaloes
There was a small hut on the pier but there was no one or nothing useful inside

Outside the hut again I followed the trail into the jungle
I soon came to another structure
Inside on a table I found a half completed sketch that appeared to be some sort of a map
Left of the table in a dark corner I found a can of gasoline
I took it and returned to the Hydraflot

I emptied the gasoline can into the Hydraflot's filler tube and activated the computer
It went through the checklist
This time I had to push the throttles to the right of the grapnel lever forward to start the craft

Soon we came to a narrow passageway between two cliffs
The way was blocked by animals
According to Valembois' journal they were Porcopotamii
I pushed the horn button below the grapnel lever and the sound frightened the animals and they soon cleared out and the craft started forward again

Just a short distance later we came across two tricorn buffalo standing in the river
Valembois' journal had described them as stupid but skittish
So instead of blowing the horn I eased the craft forward click on one of the buffaloes
Suddenly one turned and charged the Hydraflot
The craft rocked under the animal's assault and actually moved backward in the water a short ways
As the animal withdrew snorting his disgust the engine quit
A warning from the computer confirmed the engine had been damaged
Disaster
In the middle of nowhere and the engine was packed up
Rhinopotamus
Somehow I had to get around the animals
I thought of using the grapnel as a winch
At this point the river forked
Through the left cabin window I could see some rocks in the stream
I pulled the grapnel lever and shot the hooks forward toward the rocks click on rock through window
The Hydraflot will then point itself at the rocks
You can then choose grapnel mode from the computer
The cursor turns into a grapnel
Click the grapnel cursor on the target rock then pull the grapnel lever this is not a very intuitive part of the game
Eureka
The hooks bit and the craft was pulled toward the rocks

I tried it twice more with success
Then I ran out of rocks
There was only a small pier off to the left and a lone Rhinopotamus standing in the center of the river
In frustration I fired the grapnel at it
The hooks shot out and passed over the animal's head and tangled the line in it's horns
Charged with adrenaline produced by sheer terror the animal floundered towards the shore his brute strength hauling the Hydraflot along
The animal passed around the end of the pier and charged up a shallow channel
The Hydraflot caught on the edge of the pier and stopped

I climbed up on the pier to see if I could find out what happened to the Rhinopotamus and the grapnel
I waded along the shoreline following the line in the water
It led up a narrow channel and after a considerable distance I found the animal standing in knee deep water at the channel's end
It seemed unhurt but thoroughly PO ed
I had to get that grapnel back
But here was no way I was going to walk up to that animal
Not as long as it was alive or conscious

I started back towards the Hydraflot and came to a large tree
A path led off to the right
I followed it into the jungle
I used the old right hand rule
Whenever I had a choice of paths I took the right
After a while I fetched up against a cliff face
There at the bottom was a native blowpipe and a quiver of darts
I sincerely hoped they were coated with some sort of tranquilizing goop
If they weren't and I shot the buffalo with one well I had to try

I made my way back down the trail to the tree turned left and approached the animal
I loaded a dart into the gun pointed it at the animals chest and blew
The dart flew straight and stuck in the tough skin
In a few seconds the animal was snoring
I approached untangled the grapnel and made my way back to the Hydraflot
Pechosaurs
How far could I go using this hook and drag method
I had no choice but to find out
I selected a rock off to the right shot the grapnel out and was pulled away from the pier
I did this twice more

I was at a place in the river where there were two strange creatures were standing in the river next to the rocks I had to target
By now I was wary so I consulted Valembois' journal
They were pechosaurs fish eaters who caught fish by hooking insect larva to their long nasal appendages and luring the fish in
I figured they were non dangerous
I fired the grapnel and the hook caught
Before the winch could reel in one of the clever devils reached down with his proboscis and unhooked the grapnel
Then the amazing thing happened
His partner seemed to actually laugh
I tried again
Same result
Non dangerous
Perhaps
Harmless
Hardly

There had to be some way to clear the buggers out
I climbed out of the Hydraflot discovered a shallow stream and began wading up it
Soon I heard intense buzzing
Going closer I saw some immense mud like objects stuck on a cliff wall Giant wasp nests
I looked around for something to use packrat sense kicking in again
I spied two sticks a small one to the right and a large one to the left
There was also a pile of dead dried vegetation on the ground under the nests
An evil grin spread my lips as I took up the small stick and rubbed it against the larger and started a fire in the pile of dead grass
Soon the smoke billowed and my insect air force zoomed down the stream toward the river and cleared the rocks of the too clever laughing pechosaurs
I returned to the Hydraflot before either the air force or the pechosaurs wised up

I continued my slow mode of progress
The count of the grapneled rocks soon became lost
I was afraid the batteries that powered the winch would give out but they held
I passed across the face of a large waterfall
It was the one Valembois has identified in his journal
I ran out of rocks and my final grapnel target was a large wooden pier
The winch pulled the Hydraflot close and all motion stopped
The Village Workshop Collect Mix Administer Embarkation I unhooked the egg from its cradle and climbed up on the pier
Somewhere near I knew was the village where Valembois had stayed with Yekoumani and was also where he had left his crude water powered machinery
The immense falls were to the right
Probably the village was left
On to the village
I wasn't going to stop now
Workshop
Turning left I walked off the pier
At its ending I took the path into the village

I don't know what I expected but it wasn't an abandoned village
Inside an immense roofless enclosure stood a mechanism
It bore the unmistakable marks of Valembois' talent
The circumference of the enclosure seemed to be partitioned into cubicles or living areas
I began on the immediate right and did my search counter clockwise
I found strange objects and saw curious pieces of machinery

One particular noteworthy device consisted of a huge hopper and a large hammer like mechanism
Perhaps it was some kind of grist mill
Another had a crude conveyor lined with dippers that reached down into a container
When activated the scoops probably carried whatever was put into the container up into the machinery for some mysterious processing
Its room was accessed through a doorway next to a skeleton on the ground
A third cubicle contained a raised platform with a second skeleton on top

I finally found what was probably Valembois' workshop
The doorway to it was overhung by an immense bird sculpture
Inside was a desk
On it was a sketch of a water activated device exactly like the one drawn in his journal
There was also a drawer
Inside it was diskette
I wondered if it would be useful since the engine of the Hydraflot was destroyed

There was a back door in the workshop
I went through it into the jungle
I continued forward until the path forked left and right around a huge tree
Collect The Ingredients
At the base of the tree on the ground I saw a blue black bug
I captured it
I then took the right hand fork packrats right hand rule here
Not much distance had been covered when I saw up ahead what looked like a cave
Just before entering I picked some flowers from the left hand side of the trail the screen before the screen where you enter the cave

Not far inside the cave second screen just where water appeared on the floor I saw a red bug and added it to my collection
I followed the tunnel to a ladder and ascended

At the top directly ahead I saw a wooden walkway
I went to it and followed it to where a wheel came up through the center of the boards
It must be the valve to turn on the flow to start the machinery
I turned it then went back down the ladder through the cave and followed the path to where it forked and I had collected the blue black bug

There I turned right and explored the other fork
A short distance later I was at the end
On the right hand side of the path was a small palm tree with one coconut on it
I shook the tree the coconut fell and I collected it
My packrat sense was tingling
I had a veritable cornucopia of inventory items that cried out for usage
Mix The Medicine
According to Valembois' journal some sort of elixir or medicine had to be inserted into the egg to cure it before it could be taken back to its proper place
Perhaps I had the raw ingredients
Perhaps I could prepare it myself
I hoped I'd find someone to help
Mulling this possibility I returned to the village through the back door of Valembois' workshop

When I entered the village I noticed the distinct absence of a committee of learned Amerzonian pharmacists waiting to prepare the magical compound
I was disappointed
I noticed two other things too
The Valembois machine in the center was working and there was now a woman sitting in the cubicle with the platform and skeleton
However nothing I did could get her to talk or move
I was on my own

Coconuts are hard
They need to be chopped open or hammered
I went to the cubicle where the grist mill was
The hammer was merrily banging away under its watermotive power
I went to the rear of the machinery and dropped the coconut into the huge hopper
It rolled out down a ramp went under the hammer and was instantly pulverized
The milk ran into a bowl under the pedestal
I picked it up

Now what
There was one other machine
The one with the scoops
I went to the cubicle where it was located
It was now also animated
Around the rear I found the container with the conveyor of scoops passing through it and placed the flowers into it
They disappeared up the conveyor
I went to the opposite end and there was a bowl full of green stuff
I added it to my inventory
Administer The Tonic
That left the bugs
Perhaps now the mysterious woman would help
I went to her
Still nothing
Maybe it was time for a little show and tell
I handed her the egg
That got a response
Ovo
she exclaimed
I recognized it as the word for egg from the journal

Then I handed her the bowl of green stuff
Another positive response
I quickly followed with the coconut milk then the red bug
I never got to the blue black bug
Soon as she received the red bug she started the ritual described in the journal
When she finished she disappeared
I was left alone with the egg and the blue black bug of course
Embarkation
Now that the egg was cured it could be taken back to wherever it needed to be
I left the village behind and returned to the Hydraflot where I placed the egg back in its cradle

My packrat sense was tingling again
Well there was the path right from the Hydraflot
I hadn't explored that
And the forward progress of the Hydraflot was impeded by a log gate in the water
So I headed toward the gate

I found a lever with a huge snake wrapped around it
Now or never
I steeled myself and reached for the lever
Suddenly I heard flute music
It was the Amerzone woman
The snake answered the call and left the lever bare for me to pull

The gate went up and I returned to the Hydraflot inserted diskette chose boat mode and pushed the throttle ahead
The Hydraflot responded and floated under the gate and stopped next to a wooden structure at what seemed to be the end of the canal

I turned right in the cockpit and noticed a lever
I pulled it
The Hydraflot was raised to the top of the platform then slid down a ramp into more water and stopped
There was another lever on the right I used it

An overhead device similar to a cable car setup began towing the craft
I realized we were heading into the swamp mentioned in Valembois' journal
The Swamp Disaster Giraffe Just as I was getting settled for the ride disaster struck
I saw it coming but could do nothing
As we neared a thatched hut on the right I noticed the tow structure was collapsed
I braced myself and held on
The Hydraflot was overturned and I was flung into the water
Disaster
It was obvious the Hydraflot was finished
It lay partially submerged under the towing mechanism
I had to find the egg
I waded toward the hut which turned out to be a tree house built on an immense stump
Near it I found the egg still intact and apparently undamaged in its cradle
I plucked it out and headed for the tree house

I climbed the ladder at its base and entered
Inside hanging on the wall behind a table I found a small bag
There was nothing else of value there

I walked out on the porch of the hut and stared at the wreckage of the Hydraflot
I now saw that the towing structure wasn't collapsed
It ended here
The mechanism had simply failed to stop correctly and the craft had been wrecked
Crossing the swamp by Hydraflot was never the intention
How was it to be done then
Wading certainly wasn't attractive

To the right of the wreck I noticed a pole coming up out of the water
It seemed to have what looked like a loudspeaker mounted on top of it
My packrat sense began tingling
Giraffe
I climbed down the ladder and waded to the pole
Near the bottom were three protrusions like rungs sticking out of the pole
I used the bag on the bottom one and a sound emerged from the speaker
Off to the left I saw a giraffe like creature lured out of the trees by the noise
It quickly disappeared

I went toward it and found another pole
I used the bag on the middle rung and saw off to the right the same or another animal
Trees were in the way and I couldn't go directly toward it
I had to backtrack until I could turn in that direction

I had to go all the way back to the first pole before I could double back
Shortly I went by some lilly pads and a frog
Here I waded up the channel slightly to my right and between two trees
I forged ahead for quite a ways turning only slightly right on occasion
I arrived at a watery burial ground where wrapped bodies were laying on platforms above the water
There was also a pole with a loudspeaker there
I used the bag on the lowest rung

Shortly three web footed giraffes came wading through the swamp toward me
One was wearing a harness
I climbed up sat in the saddle and urged him forward
Our trip through the swamp was short and ended next to a tree with with a ladder on it

I bade my web footed friends goodbye and climbed the ladder
At the top of the tree a rope bridge stretched into the fog
I started across
The Temple Alvarez Key Volcano The bridge ended at an immense cleft between two cliffs
I followed the only path and soon found myself at the foot of a huge stone pyramid with stone steps leading to the top
I believed it was the temple sketched in Valembois' journal
I began the long climb upwards
Alvarez
At the top I opened the door and entered
To my amazement Alvarez was sitting in a chair illuminated by a pool of light that came through a square opening
I approached him and noticed he was holding a pistol
I listened to his little speech on power
It seems he felt that as long as the natives believed in the legend of the white birds they were doomed to what being merely natives
As long as they were that he as El Jefe couldn't raise them up as a nation into a modern power
He was expecting Valembois but realized I had come in his stead
He seemed to have trouble talking as if he was in pain or having trouble getting his breath
As his poisonous dribble ran down he pointed the pistol at me and swore he would keep me from going any further
Before he could pull the trigger he gave a little twitch and slumped in the chair as if someone had flipped a switch

My proximity to the members of Valembois' expedition seems to have been very detrimental
Is this case lucky for me
Three for Three
There would be no joy in Alvarezopolis tonight
Or maybe there would be
I guess it depended on who you were
My packrat sense was at it again so I took the medals from Alvarez's uniform

Directly across from the old boy was a wheel on the wall
I turned it and was rewarded by the sound of stone grating on stone

I climbed back down the steps of the pyramid
Near the base a hidden door had been opened
I entered
The Key
Inside was some wooden scaffolding
I took the stairs down toward what looked like a crude forge
There was a crane hanging over a very hot pit
I turned the crank and the crane raised a container from the depths swung toward me and lowered the container to the ground
I threw Alvarez's medals into the pan

Of itself the crane lowered the container with the medals into the heat
Soon a stream of molten metal ran from the bottom of the forge into a mold
It formed a key
I put it in my pocket

I had a key
Now I needed a keyhole
I walked past the forge toward the far end of the chamber
Halfway down the chamber on the left was a lighted alcove
A short stone obelisk was standing there
It five things on it that looked like knobs and a funny slot that could be a keyhole
I tried the key
It fit
I turned it and kept turning it until it snapped back to it's original position
I heard wind and grating stone noises

I returned to the top of the scaffold near the door and climbed the wooden steps to the top
There sat a rather crude wooden glider
I got in
As I sat down an aperture in front of the glider was opened and I was launched into space
Volcano
Well it flew but not real well
After squeezing through a narrow opening in the lip of the volcano it crashed on the edge of the lava pool
I walked around the lava pit counter clockwise until I found a cave
Inside the cave I walked over some rickety walkways suspended above the lava to what looked like a throne with an immense egg shaped jewel set in the backrest

I placed the egg on the throne
There was some activity around the jewel
I took the egg back and left the cave

Outside the cave I turned left and went back toward the crash site
After a short distance I saw a dead bird near the edge of the lava pit
I picked it up
Just past the crash sight I spied a carved volcanic formation sticking out into the pit like a pier
I walked out on it

There I placed the egg and on top of the egg the dead bird
Suddenly the egg cracked and from the top sprouted a wondrous umbrella shaped affair that lifted the egg up towards the heavens on the rising heat of the volcano
Small white birds began plummeting from the bottom of the stalk and just before hitting the lava unfurled their wings and soared skyward into the twilight sky Wow Now how the hell am I gonna get home The story goes that the white birds never stop flying
They're born they mate and they die in the hot rising fumes of the volcanoes their giant wings continue growing throughout their lives
And some people even claim that long after their death their lifeless bodies glide on tirelessly
These are but stories people say stories that feed the dreams of the children that live in the Amerzone

You can put the bread on them eat but soup you cannot sip

A
Go back to the hallway with marble statues and count the number of round mosaic plates on the marble table plates
They are blue they are mute headed for the Faraglioni
On the rocks they like to stay don rsquo t be afraid they won rsquo t fall down

Add them up to what you have

If they fall dawn they don rsquo t break as their fragile brothers do
Count them up but only those standing upright on the shelves on the hutch and dresser too

E Go next door to the pewter room upright pewter plates

Explanation of the story by Gey Savarese Read the letter from Dr Greenturtle about making your decision and the medical use of the Syrup of Dreams This letter is the last piece of information you needed to fully recover your memory and understand why you locked yourself in the house
Adriano wants your discovery of the molecule NH
He financed your research and threatens you to stop the funding if you don rsquo t hand over the CD ROM which holds your research on the synthesis of the NH molecule
On the other hand you are aware that the molecule is very powerful and dangerous
Mirta doesn rsquo t want you to give your discovery to Adriano who could misuse it
She suggests that she may even leave you forever if you hand over the CD ROMto Adriano
Tormented by this dilemma you decided to take the Syrup of Dream with the purpose to know better yourself and find the solution of the dilemma through the dream
A collateral effect of the treatment is the temporary loss of memory that can be rebuilt bit by bit during the waking up periods between the chapters of the dream
To avoid interference with the treatment you locked yourself in the house scattered over the house documents to help the memory recover and gave the key of your house to Falchetti in case of anyunforeseenproblem
Take the CD ROM that holds your research on the synthesis of the NH molecule
The CD ROM was transposed into the obsidian disk in the dream
Your quest for the obsidian disk in Anacapri was actually the quest of understanding what to do with the CD ROM in the Reality
The journey in the dream should give you wisdom for the next choice
Save Game here to see endings Take theObsidian disk the CDthat holds Nico's research on the synthesis of the NH molecule
Close the door and turn around
See Adriano come in the house using a key stolen to Mirta Listen to Adriano save the game and then make your choice Explanation of the two endings by Gey Savarese Ending You decided to give the CD ROM to Adriano despite Mirta rsquo s advice
After all you need to be financed for your further research activity and Adriano paid your research activity
But Adriano also wants you to hand over the full rights to exploit the NH molecule
You refuse so he threatens you with a gun
Falchetti Lt Nelson in the Dream and Mirta enter the house using Falchetti rsquo s keys and arrest Adriano
Mirta is disappointed by your decision and leaves you Nico Fredi for the second time maybe forever
Ending You break the CD ROM
Adriano gets mad and threatens you with a gun
He wants a copy of the CD ROM immediately
Falchetti and Mirta enter the house using Falchetti rsquo s keys and arrest Adriano
Mirta and Nico restart their tormented love story and Mirta decides to write a novel inspired by Nico rsquo s dream named ldquo The Legend of the Obsidian Disk rdquo
In the novel Nico N finds the obsidian disk in the hollow in Marina Piccola behind the wedges
He destroys it and the spirits of the animals the gecko the dolphin the snake and the seagull are finally set free

In this room is a bowl of life water help yourself
Continue on into the next room someone is trying to break the door down

Save your game and try both ways and see what happens
If you kill them be sure to pick up the items they left behind Go back into the other room and there is a brown box on the wall that has a bag of gold then push the pedestal and get a key
Now go back to the room with the altar and open the brown box on that wall
You will get a phial of life
Look around in this room
In front of you is a cement altar withsome writing on it Stand in front of it and Ali will read what is says and then speak it in English

Key
Ali will move the sword Now move to the otherstatue and repeat the process
A movie will show a door opening
Go in the new room and check it out There is a vase in the corner behind you
When I broke it I found a loaf of bread
Before you climb the rope check your life and replenish it if necessary Now climb the rope a short clip show a man cutting at the rope with a knife and laughing a dirty laugh
When you see the ledge turn Ali so he can swing sideways and land on the ledge using your side arrow key along with the Alt key Good luck I fell on my first attempt Once you make it to the ledge go through the door and read the stone to your left It explains about the fountains in the next part of the story
Red ndash Source of Light etc White ndash Purity etc Pink ndash Magic Spell Blue ndash Sleepy spell and dreams Yellow ndash burns your body and soul Green ndash fear etc Black ndash sick and bad things

The white one will turn on twice also
There are three enemies that you have to deal with one is a guard shooting magic arrows at you he is in the other area There is a dude on a roller board in the same area
You can see the roller man from up high to your left before you move down
You can shoot some magic at him from up here or fight him on the ground
In the room you are in there is a old man in the small building you will be able to see him from the last roof before you get to the ground
Throw a knife at the old man you better take care of the others before you use the gold windmills
Walk slowly toward the next room and look for the archer
Use magic on the archer on the roof
Now that all of the enemies are taken care of go back to the first room and go to the far right upper corner and look around by the tombstones
You will find a key on the ground in that room
Turn on the windmills one at a time
After you turn one on find it and take a drink
Remember do not drink from Yellow Green or Black On the flat roof near the stairs you can climb up on a tombstone and then on up to a ledge and then to a flat roof pick up some knives
When you are done looking around the key you found opens the gate next to the stairway
There is a tombstone area to your rightafter you go through the gate
You can find some goodies up there
Brown Doors Area Shoot the guard once you drop down and get to the doorway
He is in front of you up on the roof
Use some magic F key Try to open the doors that are brown Some will open some won rsquo t The room with the empty phial has lots ofgood things up on the ledge above the door
Climb up there and fill your inventory
After you have searched everywhere go to the wall with the vine growing on it
You will have to climb this vine The other guard is up higher and blends in with the background and is very hard to see
Use some magic on him
Check your life and replenish if necessary You guessed it you have to do a tightrope dance across the board to the other building
Save your game when you make it because there are two more to cross
When Ali starts to lose his balance correct by only hitting the button once or you will over correct and he will so he just walks across the boards Jump through the opening in the roof on to the ledge down to the next ledge and on to the vault Then jump to the floor use the arrow key and the Ctrl
Key to push the broken pillar and enter
This ends Episode I
Episode II Sacred Tombs Cloaked Creatures and Rats You will find yourself in a complex of rooms with some jumps to make There are cloak creatures plus numerous rats you will have to contend with
The cloak creatures are hard to kill you have to kick or use your sword to finish them off
If they hit you with the bubbles they spew out of their mouth they will poison you
This will cause a skeleton just above your red heart
To get rid of the skeleton you must have a Phial ofAntidote
Let them see you then quickly move to the side of a pillar and use your sword They sometimes drop some gold coins There are also rats that are hard tokill so if you aren rsquo t good at killing them with a kick save some of you knives for them The best way is to keep your distance and throw knife at them
I found I had to put the icon just a hair above them in order to kill them
Some or the rats are rather aggressive There are green rivers to jump if you miss and land in it get out quickly as it will poison you
Here is a map of the area you are in
I have marked where you can find the things you need and where the villains are Burial Vaults with Gems The burial room is at left section on the map
You have to push the broken pillar to enter the vaults
When you walk through you will find a parchment about the burial vault Open your inventory so Ali can read it It says to look at the pillars and only open the vaults that match the pillars After you look at the parchment walk through the doorway The game goes into a movie clip and you see some servants cleaning and one taking a snooze on the job Move to the left on the ledge you can see the sleeping man use some magic and narrow down the odds
Check your life and draw your weapon Jump down the servant that is cleaning runs to sound a warning
The other two come out from the vaults and will also come after you I moved to the area by the top of the steps and fought them off I got two things after they died
One was a key to the vaults and the other was a Phial of Antidote
If you have a skeleton head on your screen by your heart this Phial will cure you
Look at the four pillars on the platform
Copy down the symbols you will need them in the vault rooms
Now to get to the vaults climb the stairs to your left
Vault Room The stairway to your left goes to a room with a revolving floor
You will have to jump down and run across to the other side and climb up into the other doorway
There will be shooting beam coming out of the walls you have to avoid as they sap your life
What makes it worse is that the floor changes direction and throws you off course
Watch the floor jump when it is moving so it will carry you towards the other door and then start jumping and be ready to grab hold Look at your drawing or the map to see what tombs to open
After you get the jewels close both tombs
Save you game here and then open the other vaults and watch the green water come out of the nozzles in the center of the room it will trap you in the room and kill you while you search for the correct vaults Go back across the revolving floor to the main room and place the gems in the pillars
Vault Room Now go the other way and there will be another challenge
When you jump down a double blade start whirling around and moving toward the floor
No problem getting to the other side but there is a boulder blocking the way
You will have to go back and climb back up to where you entered
This time when you jump down turn to your right and push the square next to the doorway Then run across to the other side and push the square with a thin fingernail moon it is just about opposite from the first one you pushed Number is to left of the second one you just pushed The fourth one is on the right side of the second button The thbutton is to the right of number and the last is to the right of the enter door
Good Luck
Oh and by the way don rsquo t think you can jump up and then back down after you do a couple if you do it will reset the game
When you complete this task go into the vault room and look for the correct vaults to open Here is a map for solving the moon puzzle
Puzzle drawn by Bill Voyles thanks Bill Look at the drawings above the crypts if you open the wrong ones you will have some cobras coming after you so beware
Be sure to close the crypts after you get the jewels or the bridge will not lower Just for the fun of it save you game and open the wrong crypts and see what happens
Now go place the last jewels in the pillars
The pillars will lower into the big platform a smaller platform will rise in the center and there will be a ring for you
This ring is called a ring of ldquo Ring of Slowing Down rdquo After you take the ring jump and pull yourself up to the platform you originally started from
Back to the Cloaked Creatures amp Rats Room Retrace your steps back to the room where you jumped the green river to use the potion to cause dreams
In that room is the gold chain hanging from the ceiling in a corner
Just below it there is a brown box vault that you can pull out to climb up on to jump to the chain Climb the chain and use the alt side arrow to jump off the chain on to the ledge
You end up in a room that looks the same as the room you got the empty Phial from
Open the door and it will show a clip of Ali sneaking up towards three guards and their boss
Saving Melissa The head guard is talking about you and telling them to beware of you that you are dangerous When they split up use your number key and throw a bomb at the three guards if you are lucky you could get all three of them
If you don rsquo t kill them all with the bomb use your magic on them you can rsquo t get near them to use your sword
To the right of the door you came through is a gold gate with cobras in there They are not that hard to kill try just using your foot or if you have a lot of knives throw them
One other thing you can do is lure one cobra out through the gate and then jump over him and go though the gate and leave him for later Kill the other two cobra with a your knifes or kick them
You will get three bombs in the back corner
There is also a knife by the small tree
Then you can lure the first cobra into the enclosure jump over him and out the gate and you will have him trap in the compound again
Be sure to check out the cemetery there are some goodies up there that you will be able to use
Across from the side cemetery is where the head guard is
He can be one hard dude to kill
I used knives if you can hit him with you will usually do him in
If you don rsquo t have any knives you can use a bomb just be careful where you throw it
Remember use the number key from the keypad to block his blows if you have to use your sword
After you finish himoff he will drop a key
Go inside the compound and turn to the next gate and find Melissa rsquo s sitting in her cell Now personally I was disappointed in this part of the game
Oh well on with the game She gives Ali a peck on the cheek and she magically is transferred back to the palace with her daddy the Sultan
Poor Ali has to find his own way there so they can tell the Sultan they want to get married After she pulls her disappearing act go back past the cemetery and to the gate on the opposite side Lowering The Moat Bridge There are two enemies in this section both are to the left
One is a guard and you will have to use magic on him
The other is an old man
Whentheyare taken care of search around for some goodies in vases
Go down the stairs that were in front of you to find a vase
There is a vase on a high ledge you will need to push the box over and climb on it to get at the vase and you will get some knives Use the Ctrl
Key and the arrow key to push the box
Those are the only things I found in this area
Now go through the door on he opposite side of the room
Take care in walking up the steps as there is a moat
The first time I went up I fell and made a big splash and needless to say drown
There is a glitch here in the game if you walk to the side of the stairs and jump into the moat you won rsquo t die from the fall but you can rsquo t get back out and there is no water
When you get to the top of the stairs you have to throw a knife at each of the ropes under the drawbridge to cut them and lower the bridge
When it come down walk across it and through the door
You will find yourself at the top of a spiral staircase
Entering the City You can see a vase to your left climb the ledges and see if it contains anything
Mine was empty
When your turn around you should be able to see a guard
Get close to he edge of the ledge you are on or climb higher to get a good aim at him and use the F key and throw some magic at him
Climb back down and go to the other side and climb up on the ledge you can see some vases down there
I think there are about of them I went down and only found a miserable rat
Go back to the stairs and walk down them
When you get to the bottom of the stair you will see a watchtower and that is where you need to get
You will also see a bell hanging on a post don rsquo t ring the bell as it will bring more guards and they are difficult to kill and they waste a lot of magic because they move around so quickly
There are three vases to your right and I found a Phial of Life there
Turn around and go towards the hanging light in the archway and there should be a vase with a Phial of Magic
The door by the bell in locked
Climb the slant cement walk just to the top where it levels off
Turn to your left and jump up and pull yourself up into the room Stay near the edge and run along the edge and jump onto the roof
Climb up on the cement wall
Walk across the top of the wall toward the lookout
Look to your left and you will see some ledges and there will be a guard how will start shooting arrows at you
Take care of him and then line yourself up with one of the ledges
You need to jump to one of them if you miss its curtains for you
Line yourself up and move as far back as you can after you push the keys for the jump let go of them if you keep your fingers on them Ali will jump a second time and probably die
I found it best to have him jump diagonally to the far ledge
Be sure to save your game before you make the jump just in case
Good Luck this is a difficult jump to do
Outskirts of the City When you reach the ground climb the tower and get the Phial of Life
Turn around and use the Ctrl
Key to make Ali climb back down
There is a vase in the other corner that has a puzzle piece
After you get the puzzle piece climb on the wooden beam to the right of the pathway
Walk halfway down it and climb up and you will find a vase with loaf of bread
Get back down on the beam and walk to the end and climb up and climb up again and find puzzle piece
Climb back down to the beam and look down the pathway and you will see a guard
Use some magic on him
Some more guards will come throw a bomb at them
Or you can use knifes
Pick up the goodies left behind
Walk down toward the arch that crosses the path turn to the left and you will find a vase with an apple
Take care as there are a lot of guards in this area
Move slowly and look up and watch for more guards
Climb up on the arch where the guard was there is a vase on the other end of the archway Save your game often The third puzzle piece is up by the palm trees
Climb on the ledge to the right of where the guard was
Walk around the corner and break the vase
Turn around and line yourself up with the striped awning
Run and jump to the awning and then to the palms and you will findPuzzle piece You can get back down by jumping to the awning and then to the ground
Now walk forward into the open area notice the rope over head
There will be guards shooting arrows at you so take care of them
Turn to your right facing a palm tree and there will be a another guard up on the roof take care of him
To your left is a alcove with two vases check them out
When you turn to leave still another guard will be shooting at you use a little magic on him
Now go back to where you climb to jump to get puzzle piece
This time stand where the vase was and line up a jump to the wall with the pink and white stripes
When you make the jump take your fingers off the jump key or Ali will keep jumping
After you make the jump you will see the rope in front of you
Ok it is time for the circus act walk across the rope using the shift and arrow keys
Then turn left and walk across the ndrope
When you get to the other side you will find a vase and when you break it you will get theJewel Binding When you turn around you will see a fountain where you can get another vision of a princess
Run and jump to the pool and see a vision of Princess Spiruline After the vision jump to the ground look forward see a ledge with four striped arches in front of you climb up and find a vase with a loaf of bread
Climb back down onto the arch and walk across to the other side and climb up on the ledge Walk across the floor to the lighted window To your left is a roof you have to jump to
This is a difficult jump so save your game
When you get down there walk around the corner and getPuzzle piece Turn around and back off of the roof using the Alt Key so Ali will grab the floor edge and then drop to the ground
Turn around and climb the cement ramp by the curved windows
Turn right and you will see another guard up ahead
Use your magic and then walk up another ramp and then down a ramp
Climb the stairs to the right and you will see a door to your right with a fancy gold fence just above it Walk straight over to the brown slab then turn to your left
Across the opening you will see a building with some pillars on the roof
You need to run and jump over to that building When you get there use your shift and arrow keys to walk across the narrow path toPuzzle piece
Now you need to go to the area where you can use the puzzle pieces
Jump through the hole in the roof backward and lower Ali to the ground
Now retrace your steps back to the stairs you climb to get puzzle piece
When you get to the top of the steps turn around and up the small ramp jump up and shimmy to the right and climb up
Walk straight ahead and down the steps
Turn and walk down another flight of steps
Make another turn and draw your weapon
When you get about way down these steps you will here the clomping of an old man that wants to kill Ali
This man is very strong I jump off the side of the steps before I got to the bottom
After the fight break the vase and get a Phial of Life
Then carefully go over by the hole in the floor
Snake Pit If you look down you might get a glimpse of a cobra or two
Drop a bomb down there and then jump down landing on the box Look for more cobras before jumping to the floor
When you turn the corner some more cobras will be coming
Throw another bomb or use some knifes
When you are done you will find where to place the puzzle pieces
When you are done placing them the game goes into a movie and shows a Genie talking to Ali and thanking him for releasing him This ends Episode Episode III Gates to the Rich City Outside of the City This episode starts with a movie clip showing Ali walking through a door and climbing some stairs There is a sign directly in front of him
Go read the sign
It says ldquo Gate to the Rich City Closed at Night rdquo
When you turn around you will see a vase to your left Go break it you will get a bag of gold coins
Climb up on the wall next to where the vase was and move to the back as far as you can get and move forward toward the steps as far as you can
When you look half way down the hall on the opposite side there is a nitch in the wall and a roller bad guy waiting for you
Take good aim and shoot a bolt of magic at him
If you kill him you will hear some gold etc
falling to the floor Now run jump diagonally to the ledge kitty corner from where you are
Stand there and look down to the far wall and you will see another roller man
Give him some of your magic The third roller man you can rsquo t see yet but if you move down farther on this ledge he will come out
Throw a bomb at him or a knife or two when he is taken card of go pick up the goodies they left for you
These guys are dangerous and if you let them get near you they will throw bombs at you
They are very hard to kill
One of the goodies you will get is the Smuggler rsquo s Parchment
When you get it be sure to read it
It tells you where to look for the window to knock three times on and that it is near the Potters Shop
Try hard to conserve your inventory
If you waste a lot of your items here replay and see if you can do better
Climb up the stairs next to where the roller man was against the wall and then climb onto the railing and walk toward the corner of the railing Jump to the window and use your foot to break it
Draw your sword
Opening the Gate There is a guard in here and they are well protected and are also very hard to kill
I used a bomb on him he is standing on the right side
When you kill him a cut scene will show a boss crocodile man telling two guards to see what the commotion is all about
When you see the door open throw a bomb towards it and you should wipe these two out
Again pick up the goodies now is the hard part
Move down the stairs slowly when you get about half way down you should see the crocodile man I did a backward flip back up the stairs and threw two knives at him and that finished him off He is one fast dude and really really hard to kill so you must move fast
If he gets near you he swats you with his tail
When he is taken care of go to the controls by the windmill
You have to move the levers to open the door to the Rich city Numbering the levers from left to right you would move the handles in this order
The game goes into a move show the gears coming together causing the gate to open
When you have done that retrace your steps and climb out the window and run down to the other end and you will see the gate is open
Now the real fun begins as there are a lot of enemies in here Lots of guards patrolling and others up high shooting arrows when you get near them
Inside the City Move straight across up on to the narrow ledge toward the right
Turn left and jump and pull up
The guards should come and you can use magic on them bombs or knives Some times the guards will cluster together and if you are lucky you can throw a bomb at them and killthem all at once
After you kill them go down and pick up the items they left behind Climb back up on the little ledge again and keep going up until you see the vision pool
After you see the dance climb back down and move through the area
You will find another staircase a littler farther ahead near the staircase there is a sign that says ldquo Sultan rsquo s Gardens rdquo etc keep this area in mind
Go down the two flights of stairs
There will be more guards down here and also a guard up high that will shoot arrows at you
After you kill the guards look around next to the bottom of the stairs there are some purple colored arches and there is a vase in there with gold pieces in it Save all your gold you are going to need it
Walk toward the green palms and climb up
Climb up to the other palms
There are two sections on each side of this and each one has a scorpion on it Jump over to the phials but when you jump take your finger off the button so Ali won rsquo t go any farther Walk around carefully and get the other phial
Now jump back by the palm Climb back down Across from the bottom palm there is a door behind some pillars Here is a map of the area
Go open that door and head up the steps About half way up the steps you will see a bunch of boxes on the right climb over them and you will see a button on the wall Push the one box out on the steps then push the button and run like crazy up the steps to get through the door Once you get through the door it will remain unlocked
The Crazies After you pass through the door you will see two men standing by some pillars Shoot some magic at one of them and get a big laugh Glynn named them the ldquo Crazies rdquo I think it is a good name for them as they certainly do go crazy Be careful here as there are guards on the roof and they will shoot arrows at you Each of the crazies has a key and you need to get them to enter the door to the Mosque that they were guarding Watch them closely one runs around the building and the other just runs in a large circle Stand near the pillar and when he comes your way swing your sword and kill him and get that key When you have done that go stand near the side of the building where you can find a narrow spot and when the other crazy come running at you swing your sword again and get his key
Ring of slowing Down Enter into the room and walk to the right on the outside of the pillars the last pillar on the right has a button on the side that opens a door behind you and you will get aRing of Slowing Down Continue around the pillars and you will find another pool of vision
Watch the vision of another Princess and then keep going past the pillars and find a bag of gold
Note My game has an error mode in this section but I just kept pushing the enter key and managed to get past the error
There is another room attached to this room but there is nothing to do in there right now
But as long as you are here check it out and see what is in there
Go back out side and walk towards the door you originally came in
While facing it turn to your right there is another door down at the end of the walk
Map of new area Scorpions Galore When you enter there will be an old man to take care of
Walk down the hallway and you will see a gate that is locked
Turn to the right and open the wood door
There will be another old man to fight Down past him is a cobra pit so beware Climb the stairs and walk down the wide hall stay to the left side because the other end of the snake pit is there and difficult to see
Walk over to a wood beam and cross a scorpion pit Run and jump forward to the cement slab roof in front of you
When you get to the other side run down and jump to the roof that has vases on it
The vase in the far left corner has a scorpion in it
But just in back of that same vase is a bag of gold waiting for you
From this roof jump to the other roof with a bunch of scorpions you will have to do some fancy footwork to break those vases gather the goodies and not get stung
When you accomplish that run and jump back
Believe me it can be done
When you get back to the other roof jump back across to the slab with the beam on it Run the opposite way and jump to the roof of the building the crazies were guarding Be careful there could be a guard up here yet
On the other side of the large dome is a vase with somegold in it Go back to the other side of the dome and look to your right you should see a brightly lit area Run and jump over the fence to that area There is a small room with a button on the wall
Push the button and the doors on the floor will open
Careful there are a lot of scorpions guarding tons of gold
Drop a good old bomb on them and wipe them out jump down and run your finger through those bags of gold
Climb back out of the pit and carefully walk along the ledge to the left
You will see some more vases guarded by another scorpion
Ignore those for now and keep going along down to the other end where there is a vase with a key in it
You will need the key Scorpion Map Then turn around and go back by the scorpion guarding the vases Find a good spot and throw a knife at him after you kill him back off the ledge catching Ali and lower him to the floor and have fun breaking some more vases
Run and jump off this ledge toward the fire pot and then head down by the door the crazies were guarding
Standing with that door behind you there is another door across the way
Go over to this door and open it
This is where you use the key you found in the vase
Follow the passage to a box push that box and get a bag of gold
There is another door at the top of the steps but it will not open
Now we need to find the Smugglers window
Go back to the double stairway that you climb by the Sultan rsquo s Garden sign refer to the map on page stand with your back to the stairs look upand you will see part of a door
Climb up to the door and enter in carefully there are some stairs in here
Go down the stairs and there is a vase with another goodie in it
See the sign hanging that is the potter rsquo s sign so the window by the other door is the one you have to rap three times The window will open and Ali has to bargain to gain entrance Ali drives a hard bargain
He sure chewed him down Don rsquo t you just love Ali rsquo s expressions
Smugglers Tunnel After you walk through the door there is a hall to the left with a hole in the floor
You can drop down through the hole if you want
I went the other way and walked down three flights of stairs
I didn rsquo t find anything useful in this area
When you get to the bottom of the stairs there is another hole in the floor
Jump down in the hole and you will be in a tunnel with two scorpions waiting for you You can kill them if you want but I just jumped over the first towards the right then jump over the second one towards the left ran up the stairs and turn to the right jump and pull yourself up You are now outside of the Palace
Outside the Palace There are four guards on the balconies in this area and another Crocodile man
You can walk around here and not worry about the guards until you attack the Crocodile man
I checked out the doors at this end and couldn rsquo t enter any of them
So I followed up the slant walk towards Crocodile man I climb up on the two ledges to the left so I could use some magic on the guard across the way
Then I crossed to the other side and took care of the other one When you get down to where the street curves there are two more guards Now climb back up the two ledges and take card of them
Go to the right when facing towards the palace there are some vases over by the pillar
I found a Phial of Magic and some knives Those are the only goodies I got except for a couple of gold coins that one of the dead guards left behind Now climb up on the ledges next to where Crocodile Man is sleeping Nail him with a couple of knifes
He will leave a key to the palace door
Map of Palace and grounds starting from Smuggler rsquo s Door PALACE Enter the palace and head right up the curving staircase Do not killthe guards at the top by the steps as they are friendly at the moment The game goes into a movie and you are granted an audience with the Sultan the Grand Vizier and your girlfriend Melissa are there
After the movie the audience with the Sultan is over and you have to leave
He tells you that you can rsquo t marry his daughter until the other princess rsquo s are rescued
Searching the Palace When you get back out by the guards turn to the right and go check out that part of the castle you get a nice view of the entrance area
There is nothing over there but it is a good idea to get the lay of the land
When you finish looking around go through the doorway on the other side and check that area out
You get to see the entrance area from this side
Go down the other way there are four vases around the pillar in the room
I got a bomb and an apple
The door next where you entered into this room is lock but go try the next one Guess who

SULTAN rsquo S GARDENS Walk around the building and follow the path you will come to some rolling plant carts
You have to move these so you can continue on
There is a scorpion on the ground pull the rolling cart toward the scorpion Then go to the other side and push it toward the scorpion
Pull the second cart out run far enough so you cn get around and push it to the spot where the first cart was
Follow the path until you come to the Princess sitting on the bench Before you go talk to her go up to the fountain and get the gold out of the water
Then run around on the grounds and pick up the three apples There is an aggressive flower so watch out for it
Chop it with the sword if you want you will meet up with many more of these flowers Go talk to the weeping Princess
Before you go by the Princess put your sword away She says she is suppose to marry the first man that comes past her and she doesn rsquo t want to marry the first man that passes her
She said she needs flowers one of them being the Flower of scents After the movie clip go through the other arch To the right is a locked gold gate so take the other path that will lead you to some tall wooden doors
Barracks Area There are three guards in here one is on the roof and the other two are foot soldiers marching around
First deal with the one on the roof with some magic he is on the left side you should have no trouble spotting him
When you are done with him move to the right or left wall and hide so the soldiers won rsquo t see you
When you here them getting close throw a bomb out and kill them
Be sure to aim up high so the bomb gets close to them
If you don rsquo t get them both wait for him to come back and then get him
I only found some gold where the archer was standing
Go past the gold gate to the hall just in front of you
Follow the path under the bridge you should then come to a covered bridge
Keep going and you will see some brown on the left side in the bushes
That is another rolling cart
Go push the cart until you can get by it
Scorpion Pit Follow until you come to an opening with a lot of scorpions What you need to do here is jump across to the other side using the small brick pillars When you get to the other side draw you weapon at there is another Crocodile man and he is one really hard one to kill if he gets near you
He has a very long tail and knows how to use it This is a good place to save your game just in case I hope you have some knives left if you do take aim and throw a couple you don rsquo t have much time
Singing Reed Now for some more jumping the lake is full of crocodiles and you must go in it to find the Singing Reeds You can go either side of the huge boulder in the lake just keep your eye out for the crocs
You will hear the Singing Reeds when you get near to them
They look something like a Cat Tails if you know what they are
There are logs and boulders to jump on After you get the Singing Reed you must return the way you came over the Scorpion pit
Save your game again
When you get back to where you climb in the bushes you can go back the way you came or go the other way
You will have to back off the ledge and then have Ali grab hold with the Ctrl
Key and drop down to the ground
You will be right near to the barracks area and there are more guards
So use your magic again
I climb on the railing so I could get better aim at them
They left the door to the barracks open so go in with your weapon ready
Barracks Move slowly down to the first room
You will find one guard with his back toward you
If you don rsquo t have a lot of bombs or knives walk quietly by him and go on to the next room In the second room there will be three guards after you do away with them you should find a Phial of Life some bread and a knife
In the third room there is one guard After he is out of the way you will find a button on the back right wall
Push the button and it unlocks the golden gate in the courtyard
Go through the gate and draw you sword out as there is another Crocodile Man walking around a small building
If he sees you he will come charging
When he comes throw a couple of knives at him two or three should do it I had only one knife so I had to use magic Pull the rolling cart toward you so you can run around the building and continue on
Ahead of you is another aggressive plant chop it up with your sword
Oh no more carts to move around
Push the cart in front of you forward so you can move the cart to your right Push the cart to your right back far enough so there is room for another cart next to it
Pull that cart back toward the entrance then run around and push it the rest of the way
Then go to the other side so you can place in by the other cart Then go pull the third cart run around and push it out of the way so you can get past it and continue on your way Guard Area for Greenhouse Next you will come upon an open air building with two guards
Move slowly until you get into range and throw some of your magic at them
If you are lucky you will kill both of them with one shot
Notice the trunk you can rsquo t open it right now but you will be sent later to get something from it so remember where it is
Greenhouse rsquo s amp Gardens Put your sword away and go talk to the gardener
He is whistling a song I use to sing when I was a kid
Do any of you recognize it The game goes into a clip and the Gardener will tell you to go find somePear Pips He will give you some magic works to say so you can enter the fruit garden area
Don rsquo t worry about the magic words Ali will say them when the time is right Look around break the vase and get a Phial of Life
Fruit Garden Go to the building across the way turn to the left and knock on the door the guard will open the door and let you in There is an archer on the balcony of the building that will shoot arrows at you
Do you magic trick again and eliminate him You can eliminate the guard that opened the door also
This door will remain open once you pass through it You can rsquo t get the pear out of the tree so leave this area
Look around if you would like there is a tiger on the other side of the gold fence but it is locked
There is a vase in this area I got a knife from it
Go across the courtyard and go through the other tall wooden doors There are some guards at the other end of the room use your magic again and then pick up the leftovers
There are a lot of vase in the side yard so go break them and you should get aParchment of Seed Read the Parchment The gist of the parchment is a puzzle you will have to figure out later
Twice as many Jasmine Seeds than Pear Pips Less then Jujube Seeds More Rose Seeds than Pear Pips as many Patchak Seeds as Jujube Seeds At least Jasmine Seeds Cactus Garden Leave this area and go back to the courtyard there is a small wooden door
Go check it out
There is a guard in their so treat him to some of your magic
There is a bucket on the ground pick it up and leave this area and go back to where the pear is in the tree
To open the door you have to set the bucket down
Then open the door then pick the bucket back up
Are you having problem setting the bucket down To put the bucket down use your space bar
I got stuck there for a long time never thought about using the Space Key
Repeat this process at the door where the pear is growing
Fruit Garden ndVisit When you get to the fruit garden fill the bucket with water at the fountain
Walk over to the farthest container hanging on the fence from where you are
Pour the water into the container
Fill each of the containers doing the one closest to you last of all
This should unlock the gate with the Tiger
This ends Episode

When the clip is done you will be in the area with the tiger so use your mouse and wheel your sword and kill that tiger even if he is endangered specie
Pear Pips When he is dead go to the pear tree and jump up and grab that delicious looking pear
Walk back to the other area and pick up the small pear that fell out of the tree Open your inventory and eat that small pear so you have somepear pipsto give to the head gardener
You will find the gardener in his workshop at the top of the ladder
Movie Clip The game goes into a movie clip and the gardener complains how slow you are and also how small the pear pips are
How things were different years ago Ain rsquo t that the truth
Guard Area ndTime He gives you a key and tells you to go fetch his hoe
The key fits into the trunk we saw earlier
When you get out by the trunk you will be attacked by bees the only way to kill them is to use your sword
They sure are nasty and hard to kill but keep at it and you will hit them In the trunk besides getting the hoe you will get a phial
Take the hoe and go find the gardener he is in the cactus greenhouse area
When you talk to the gardener be sure you don rsquo t use the action key
If you hit the action key by accident you will get struck by lightning
Save your game and go ahead and try it
See I told you
When you give the gardener his hoe there will be another movie clip about how he had invented a cactus without any prickers on it and that he had given it away
He asks you to find the watering can
The watering can is out in the main room where you first talk to the gardener
After you find the watering can go back to his workshop and stand at his workbench
You now have to make the flower of scents
Flower of Scents Did you figure out the clues Go back and look at the clues and see if you can come up with the answer
Look them over carefully it is not a hard puzzle to figure out go ahead give it a try If you can rsquo t figure out the clues I will put the answer on the next page
Good luck fellow gamers
Use the up down arrow keys to choose the number you want and use the side arrow keys to move from one type of seed to another
Secret Door Be sure to pick up the Phials in the gardeners workshop
Then go exploring
In the room in the back there are some large crates you have to move them around to find a hidden door
Irrigation Complex When you open the door you will be in the irrigation complex
Again you will have to fight off some more bees
What a pain they are
Go check out the vase I got a bomb
Go up on the platform you should find a crank The gold gate is locked so move to the next area There are a couple of scorpions If they bother you give them a swift kick Do notuse the crank yet
You can find the first jewel without making any changes to the irrigation system
When you open the door you will be in the irrigation complex
Again you will have to fight off some bees
What a pain they are
Go check out the vase I got a bomb
Go up on the platform you should find a crank The gold gate is locked so move to Area
There are a couple of scorpions in Area If they bother you give them a swift kick
You can find the first jewel without making any changes to the irrigation system
Move on to Area there are two cobras there take care of them Now push the pedestal over to the ledge and you will be at Area Go get the first jewel right away
The jewel is calledJewel Magna Look on page at the picture of the rdarea Jump to the pipe like it shows in the picture and then jump into the pool and pick up the jewel
Be sure you have full life before making any jumps
The jewel is in the center of the pool and you can see it glitter Now move on to Area to do this you have to climb on the tree stump and jump to the ledge
Pull yourself up and then slice up the two nasty mean flowers
Then climb up the next ledge
You will have to back off the edge here and have Ali grab a hold and shimmy past the narrow place
When he gets to the wide area pull him up
Now go as far as you can and then back off this ledge and catch Ali again and drop to the ledge below
There will be some cobras so have some knives ready
You will have to drop down off this ledge also use your F first as there is a long tailed meany down there and he will be coming at you the minute your feet touch the ground
When he is dead walk over by the pond
This is where you will get theRainbow flowerafter you change the irrigation system There are pipes that control where the water is going
The crank you have is used to divert the water
Answer to the Flower with a scents Pear Pips Rose Seed Patchouk Seeds Jasmine Seeds Jujube Seeds You have to have the watering can if not Ali will say ldquo I forgot the watering can rdquo Irrigation Complex The letters on the squares are showing The position of the water flow when you First get to this area
D down U up Area Red squares are cobras
Area When all the enemies are taken care of you can concentrate on solving the irrigation problems Look for careful ways of climbing up and climbing down
In the picture above there are two ways of getting to where Ali is stand right now
One way is to push the pedestal close to the ledge or there is a small brick chimney type stones in the left hand corner from where Ali is standing
Just climb on the water diversion close to the wall aim Ali toward those bricks in the corner
Be sure to back him up as far as you can then run jump at the same time and he will grab the ledge and pull himself up
Area From ledge jump to pipe going over the pool where the jewel is then down to pick up the jewel Jump from stump to first ledge climb to second ledge shimmy past narrow spot and then climb up go to far edge
Back off the ledge using Ctrl
Key to catch Ali then drop to lower ledge
Sultan rsquo s Private Garden There are two guards on the ground and an archer on the balcony across from where you are standing Use your magic on the archer and then the foot soldiers should come running over by you
They move around quite rapidly so the best thing to do is drop a bomb on them
If you don rsquo t have a bomb you can try magic or throwing a knife
Good luck After you have taken care of that nasty business be sure your life is filled to the top because it is a long ways to the ground Climb down backwards like before turn Ali around and back him up using the Enter Key and the down arrow
When he is in position push the down arrow by itself and then quickly hit the Ctrl
Key so he will catch himself
Then you can drop to the ground hopefully you will preserve some of you life that way
Look for some vases here also
Here is a map of the area
When you climb the rope you will have to jump sideways
On the table you will find a cactus plant and you will get a Passport
To get off the balcony I jumped to a ledge on the wall turned backwards and backed up and then grab ledge then drop to the floor
I tried to jump to the rope but I didn rsquo t make it
When you get back down to the ground play the flute again so the rope will go back into the basket
Then push or pull the basket to the ldquo enter rdquo area
Get your flute back out and play it again Say your getting pretty good at playing the flute
climb the rope and go back the way you came
Now you have all senses
Go find Princess Spiruline and offer the gifts
She accepts you as a husband and then plants a kiss on you and the Genie does the rest
There is a cut scene here showing Ali talking with a guard
The guard tells Ali about the Black Cult Sect and to speak to another guard to get more information
Ali shows him his passport and the door is opened Well this place looks familiar
Read the sign it says ldquo No Entry By Order Of The Grand Vizier rdquo
Climb on the ledge behind you then jump to the ledge on the other side
Run to the other end and the enemies will show up
Drop a bomb on them or use some knifes
Pick up the goodies and then walk the other way there are vases on a ledge
I got bags with gold Now go climb the steps at the far end Look at the window you broke in earlier Wow they had to board it up way to go gamer you did good work
Go through the doorway and see some people talking
Looking For Irma Follow the path down the stairs to the left
Notice the banner it has thread on it so this must be the Tailors Shop
Just remember it is to the right of the drummer man
Do not kill the drummer man
If you do you will die
Save your game and try it
There are other people in this part of the story you shouldn rsquo t kill besides the drummer
They are the lady of the night the fencing instructor who you must defeat and there is a man that wants to tell you a story pay him and listen
Once you do and you talk to the lady of the night the race is on
When you defeat him he will give you a real classy sword makes you old one look really cheap Look for vases and climb around and look for merchants
Before you buy anything check the prices and compare get your moneys worth
There are a lot of enemies
You know the drill do away with them and pick up the spoils from the kill
Get all the gold you can and when you find a merchant buy some life and magic you will need a lot of it soon
There are several things you must do in this area
As you walk around try to become familiar with area later you will have to find a lady named Irma and you have to sprint to make it When you find the Lady there will be some roller men and some old men
They seem to be more aggressive than they were before
There is a doorway to the left of the drummer there will be enemies in there watch out for them
By one of the stairways there is a vase by itself
It has a scorpion in it so don rsquo t bother breaking it
Before you can talk to the lady of the night you have to talk to the storyteller
He tells you to go find Irma so then you can go talk to the lady
She will tell you that Irma has gone to see the guard at the watchtower
She will also tell you that you will have to hurry to catch her
When you get to the watchtower the guard starts talking and the game is in a movie clip
He tells you that Irma is on her way to see tailor
Now you have to sprint and try to find Irma at the tailors When you get to the Tailor rsquo s and she isn rsquo t there you can talk to the drummer and he will tell you she went to see her brother To get to Irma rsquo s brother house you have to go up the ramp like you did when you had to place the puzzle pieces by the cobras
There is a long hall and he looks like a bad guy but he isn rsquo t so don rsquo t try to kill him
After you talk to her brother he will tell you that Irma had to leave to go back to work
Then you have to go see the lady again she sends you to see the guard at the tower and the guard tells you to go to the Tailors Shop and you keep getting the run around
So sturdy my map and follow the path Oh by the way there is no way you can sprint from Irma rsquo s brother to the Lady so don rsquo t even try
Do your sprinting from the guard to the Tailor Shop
After you talk to Irma she will tell you that the drummer man use to be a member of the Black Moon and you should go talk to him
Before you do go to one of the Merchants and load up on Life Magic and some knives
From this part of the game do not run out of these things Down past Irma there is a passage to the right
There is a sort of small picture on the right wall
The Drummer opens it and then he is killed and you will have to fight a very tough enemy from the Black Moon Here is a map of the area maybe it will help you with the Irma puzzle
When you push the button a passage opens and you now are in the sewers and there will be a lot of Black Moon members to fight
This ends Episode V Episode VI The Magic Cave
After you push the button on the wall where the drummer was before he got killed you will find yourself in the sewers where there are a lot of enemies
The best way to help you through this area is with a map
Slime Canals When you go through the first door you will descent two sets of stairs The guard will be towards the left
They are not to hard to kill but the throw knives at you so you have to run up to them
If you have a lot of magic you can us F to protect yourself
After you kill him pick up the items he left behind
There is a narrow walkway going to your left follow it at the end of the walkway you will have to jump across the slime canal
If you fall in the slime you will get a skull and crossbones
This slime water also steals your life You will get a lot of phials of antidote in this area I guess the creators of this game new we would need these
Follow this walkway around to the other side
There you will make another jump
Move slowly along this walk because there is an opening there and a mean rat and another guard will be waiting for you
You should eliminate the rat first as he can bite you like mad and steal you life away rapidly
Again pick up the leftovers and then go through the door This is a short hallway and then another door
When you open the last door there will be a guard on the other side of the canal and he is mighty fast at flinging those knives
I found the best way is to open the door and run like mad and jump the slime canal and beat the tar out of that dude
After that pest is taken care of there are two things you can do now
If you are low on life in your inventory you can go the opposite way of the caged walk to the end You will see a vase to your right jump over and get it
Your choice if you need it or not
The other thing you can do is move slowly toward the caged area there are guards down there lurking behind the bars when you get close to them they will start throwing some knives at you
Back up and wait for them
If you have a lot of knives of your own wait till they start coming toward you and fling a few back or you can also use your magic I guess the best thing to do is look at your inventory and see what you have a lot of When you are done with that business walk to the end and jump kitty corner to the ledge There is a door to your right that is loaded with guards They are not too hard to kill
If you have a lot of magic and are low on life use your F key and Ali will take care of them in short order When you get to the end of this passageway you will end up at Slime Lake To the left of you in the corner is a large rock
Also on the wall is a big white button
When you push the button it cause a large platform to rise from the slime When you step on the platform it causes other platforms to rise When you step back off the platform the other platforms sink
So now your job is to go find some more large stones There are three more you need altogether When you look at Slime Lake to the right you can just make out an opening in the wall
That is where rock number is Retrace your steps back to where you enter this area ROCK NUMBER As you walk out the last door turn to your left and move to the end then turn around You have to move down there so the door will close
After the door closes walk to the opposite end jump across turn to you right and walk around this wall
When you get to the other side you will see another large rock to your right
Back up close to the wall do a forward jump and let go of the keys then pick up the rock
Stand so you can do a backward flip to the wall and then walk back to the other side To your right there isadoor
RAT ROOM Jump over to that door
Be prepared there is a ton of rats in there and they are very aggressive If you are loaded with knives start flinging them and killing the rats
There are to many of them to try kicking them Another thing you could do is open the door and throw a bomb in What I did one time is lure a rat out run down by the caged area and when he came that way throw a knife at him
Went down got another and did the same thing If you have a lot of life you can open the door run in and grab the rock in the top right corner on a pile of rubble and then run out again
Platform Jumping Puzzle Now that you have the three rocks go back to the other door and get yourself back to the lake
Now the real jumping starts You should have three rocks in your inventory Place the first rock toward the right hand top corner of the platform
Don rsquo t go to far or you will drop it into the slime Placing that rock will make the other rocks stay up Now run and jump to the tall platform to your left
If you get a good running start he will jump to the top so take your fingers off or be prepared to push the back flip so he doesn rsquo t fall in the slime and die Place a rock on this platform
Now jump back to the original platform and then go back to where you picked up the first stone by the button Line yourself up so you can run between the ceiling columns to the platform that is in front of you With this jump I think Ali will catch the side and you will have to pull him up just in case be ready with a back flip When you get there you will see another small platform to your right and down a little lower Line your jump up and jump to that platform
Place a stone here which will cause a tall platform to rise near where you will pick up stone number Save your game as you move along sometimes it is hard to make these jumps Jump across to the platform climb up on the tall platform and claim your prize of stone number
There is a map on the next page if you are having trouble following my directions
Placement of Stones Jumping Back Now you must jump all the way back but on your way pick up stone number the last stone you place before getting stone number Place one of the stones you are carrying on the tall platform
Then jump back to home base
Turn to your right and jump to that platform
Pick up this stone
Then jump to the platform next to the wall
Place a stone on this platform and then jump back
When you are back to where stone number one is jump to the platform to the right when facing the lake
Then jump to the platform next to the other wall and place a stone there
You should now have a way to cross the lake Save you game as you jump
Once you get there all the platforms behind you will sink back into the slime
Good Luck fellow gamers
Rock Placement for Crossing the lake Slime Canals Good job glad you made it across
Open the door and guess what
Some more canal jumping After you jump across the canal turn to your right follow around the corner there is a vase on the other side of the canal It was empty when I went over there
There is a door by the boat enter that door and you will find a guard there waiting for you
These guys are much harder to kill they seem to have some pretty good armor on
After you kill him you should find a key that he leaves behind
I didn rsquo t find anything else so I climb the staircase
To your right is a vase and I got three bombs
Go on through the next door and down some stairs and you will have to make another canal jump
There are iron bars to your right so go to the left and follow around the corner
Jump across to the other side and head to the next corner
You should get a movie clip showing the guard you will have to defeat
After you make the next jump go to your left
Use your sneak approach
You sneak by pushing the Shift Key twice really fast
Peak around the corner where his face is it should be black it if is that is the back of his head
Get right up behind him and then let him have it Pick up the goodies and jump across again
This time go to the right and sneak up on the next guard be sure to save your game some of these guys are really tough dudes If you have a lot of magic use the F key for some help
Now you have to make another jump and when you get to the next circle go to your left again
This time you don rsquo t have to sneak
As you approach the opening there will be a guard to your left who is throwing knives Make sure your life is full and jump across and run down and get that dude After you are finish with him across from where you are standing there is a jewel in the slime at the end of the walkway Check your health again aim a jump grab that jewel and get out of there This jewel is called the Jewel of Paralysis it is very importantbecause you won rsquo t be able to finish the game unless you have it
There is a map below of the area you just read about
Map After Lake Jump Enter Maze of the Black Moon Sect
Across the way is another door and now you are getting close to some of the more important Black Moon Sect
Open the door but be prepared there are guards in here and they are tough
Take care of them in Ali fashion
Now move down the hall and turn left then take a right move slow as there will be another guard at the next left turn
Before you move to fast toward the door in front of you to the left will be a second guard so you better take care of him also
When you are done with both of them open the door Larder Room Wow three more doors but good doors the one directly across from you holds three vases with a phial of life and magic
The last door to your left has bombs and knives and the first door gives you your favorite meal loafs of bread and apples
Now that you are well taken care of off to the business of clearing this area of the enemies
Turn left after you leave the larder the hall will turn to the left again
The next turn is to your right and you guessed it another guard You know the drill kill him
Be sure to check out everything these dudes drop you should be finding some relics that some of these guards drop
Across from where you are is another door but I think it will be locked so we will have to go find a key someplace
Turn around from the locked door and turn to your left walk on down and there is a hall way to your right
Another guard but he has a key so let him have it so he will let you have it This hall is square so if you want to look at the same scenery just walk around the square
Now if I didn rsquo t make a mistake if you go back to the door that is locked there will be a guard in there
Go ahead and kill him butdo notgo through the next door The big guy is in there and you aren rsquo t prepared to take him on yet Leave this room and turn to your right the hall then turns right again
When you get to the next intersection there should be a door to your left
That is the library there is two guards in there and there is a henchman on the balcony When you collect all of the relics you have to place them on pedestals on the balcony
If you want to go in the library now go ahead sooner or later you will have to might as well get it over When you are done looking around the library
Walk straight ahead pass the two turn offs to the end of the walkway and then turn right there will be a guard around the corner
Again take care of him There is a map of the area below if you need it
Upstairs Room There is a door just past him and there are three flights of stairs to go up
When you get close to the top this will be a good time to use your F key push it once to get the figure when Ali has the little white beads surrounding him then push F again and it will put a shield in front of him
There is a guard on the left as you reach the top of the steps After the first guard walk straight across down the steps into a sunken room and then up the steps on the other side of the room and then take a left
Hurry down to the end of the hall and turn left and enter a big room with guards
I think it is kind of strange that while you are fighting the first guy the second one just stood there for me until I started picking on him
You should get a couple more relics on these dudes
There is another guard just around the corner now he might just enter the fight if you get near him so take care of him too
When you are done with them smash all the vases and load up on phials and other good things
Now go back to where the sunken room was and look through the fancy decorated wall you will see the head Black Moon guy and he has a lot of magic so you have to prepare yourself for him
Before you can fight him you must go back to the library and place all the relics
After you place them on the pedestals a jewel will appear on the main floor that is necessary to have in order to fight the head of the Black Moon Sect Do you have all of the relics
There are of them
Here is a map of the area we were just in if you are having trouble following my instructions
Now that you have all Relics go back to the Library and place them on the pedestals on the balcony
After you do you will get a gem on the main floor just jump at it and I will go into your inventory
This is the Jewel of Protection Now go to the bad guys fancy room
The game goes to a movie clip and you see Ali entering the room on tippy toe The door slams shut behind him and problems will now start
Pull out your sword and go get behind a pillar so you can use your F key so you can protect Ali
The image will go from white to a gold that is what you want
When that happens go out and swing your sword at him he will disappear and then appear some place else Jump behind a pillar and replenish your life and magic if you need it
When you see him go after him again and again you have to hit him about or times to defeat him
This is quite a challenge gamers good luck to you When you have defeat this wizard go back to the upstairs room Go to the bookcase in the other room there is a book sticking out and you must move it to open another passage
After you move the book the bookcase in the room with the Black moon will move revealing a new area to explore
Button Puzzle Moving Walls Enter the new area and make right turn there will be a white button on the wall to the left
Push this button and the wall will slide to the side and you can move on to another button
When you push this button the wall will again move revealing a third button The wall directly to your left will move back opening another passage that goes to the right Follow this passage to the end and turn to the right and lo and behold GUESS WHAT
Another button When you push this button it opens a passage in the hall that you just came down Go down to that passage and enter it
As you walk there will be an opening with a button to your left
Ignore that button for the time being
Follow the hall to the end and it jogs to the left and to the left again and then a dead end Go back to that little room that you ignored
Push the button and it closes the doorway you enter this section from
Go back down the hallway and instead of turning left turn right and push that button and this reopens the doorway that closed
Now go way back there and this time when you go though the doorway turn to the right and push the first button you come to
This should open the passage where you got the dead end before and there should be another button by the dead end to push When you push this button you will hear something moving but don rsquo t leave this spot in a second or two the wall in there will move back
I think they delay it to get gamers to go looking and then they push some other buttons and are trapped forever
Here is a map of the button puzzle
When you leave this are you will come to another door there will another guard to fight so go to it and fix him up with a long nap
Open the next door and move down the hall there is a door on your left go ahead and open it there is gold there and other good Thing so help yourself
After you have filled your pockets leave this room and turn to your left
Swinging Blades amp Rescuing the Princess OH
OH
Look what is ahead some swinging blades and you have to get by them
Line yourself up in the middle of the bridge take some small steps to see if you are walking straight
Then run and jump all the way across easier then you thought wasn rsquo t it
Whew that rsquo s a relief
Go though the next door and there will be a guard right around the corner
Use your F again and take care of him
There are two doors in this room go to the door opposite the one you came in
There are two guards in there also and two more doors
The door in front of where you enter from has a Princess in it
Go give here one of Ali rsquo s magic kisses and send her back to her papa Sultan
Leave this room and turn to the right and open that door
There are some vases with a phial of life and a phial of magic
Return to the other room and you will see a very tall dude with at very long weapon that you will have to defeat
Good Luck Prepare yourself with some F and open thedoor Throw a couple of knives at him and move closer throw another one and when he is down really tear into him
When he is done for again there is another door I didn rsquo t find anything is this room
There is a map below for this area if you need to refer to if or if you need more help more Guard Outpost After you look around this room open the other door and it leads to a teleport that takes you to a guards outpost
There are some occasional visiting groups of people you need to kill for there valuables
There is a merchant in this area to but some phials from
Buy all the magic and health you can afford and some knives will come in handy if your inventory is low
Be sure to save Gold Coins though
Move forward and you will see three people talking
Take care of them
Move on down and you will come to the Ramparts
There is a gate directly in front of you and Ali will ask the guard to open the gate and he will tell you that you need a pass to leave the compound
Turn around and take care of the people there
Read the sign it tells the hours for hearing a lecture on the ramparts
There is a walkway by the sign go down it and climb on the wall there are two cobras you can throw knives at
Jump down and put your sword away
There is a scorpion there lure him toward you and then give him a kick
Draw your sword out again and go investigating the old man will come running out take care of him and be sure to read the Parchment of Mogamba that he dropped
There is a vase near where the scorpion was
After you have searched this area well climb up on the other wall
There is another cobra over there you can throw a knife at him or just jump over him climb the hill and break the vases and get some goodies
Then just jump over him on the way back out
Read the sign that has a picture of a camel on it
Then put your sword away and go talk to the camel merchant Did you here what he said ooo Gold that is highway robbery where in the world will we get that kind of money
While you are there if you want to have a ldquo hoot rdquo go climb on the camel and enjoy Merchants Shop Go back the other way and you will pass some white poles turn to the left and there is a door you canenter to buy your phials
Check your inventory so that you can have an even amount of magic and life
Load up and buy some knifes with your spare gold unless you already have a lot
But do save out a few gold pieces just in case you need them
I know you have to have some gold for the camel but right now the magic and life and the knives are more important
Save at least Gold coins
Continue on and you will see a sign ahead that reads Military Area Military Area Before you get to close to the door use your F key and turn on some protection
There are four guards behindthe door waiting to get even with you When you are prepared move closer to the door and the game will go to a movie with Ali telling them to open the gate that he has to see the captain on orders from the Sultan
They open the game and the guards are order to kill you so grab your sword and fight like mad Pick up the goodies again and go all the way to the end of this part of the military area
There are some vases down there and you will get two apples
Now move back the way you came an on the right there is a crocodile man guarding a door
You know he reminds me of Reptar on the Rug Rats cartoon
Now all those knives will come in handy you need to throw about four or five of them to take him downyou don rsquo t have to many knives find another way todestroy him He will drop a key to the door behind him that takes you to the Captain Barbeck Arena Open the door and again a cut scene will show the Captain using the ball and chain on a roller man
Wow has he ever got a temper and we have to fight him
After the cut scene hit the downward arrow key and flip Ali away from him
Push your F key for some protection and then push the F key if you have time Now if you are getting an error message in this part of the game like a lot of gamers did just keep pushing the enter key and move away from him
He is fast but you can defeat him
You have to use the spell of blinding and when you succeed you will have to run up to him and slash away
The spell of blinding is F
When he comes out of it move away and load up on your life and magic and use those keys again
He is one hard dude to kill

He gives you the camel And you can be on your merry way
This end Episode VI
Episode VII The Great Fortress Movie Clip This episode starts out with a movie clip showing Ali riding the camel to the cave
Ali says some words and the very large bolder rolls out of the way so he can enter
The Magic Cave Move forward through the cave watch out ahead there are three rats you can kill them or just run and jump over them and continue on your way Don rsquo t move to fast or you might miss the pits some of them blend in with the ground
Be sure to save your game after some of these hard jumps There are two jumps to make and then you should come to two ledges to climb
When you get up there one way is a dead end so naturally go the other way Move slowly and when you come to a cross walk there will be two of Mogamba rsquo s tribe that will attack you
You can use your F key for some protection
Make sure your life is full
The tribesmen you fight in this part of the game look like they are far away but they run fast and it is hard to prepare yourself
Always keep you sword in your hand
Sometimes you can use magic to kill them before they see you
After you kill these two go the opposite way there will be another jump to make
Cavern After the jump you will come to a big cavern There are two archers up on the mountainside and one guy on the ground
You will have to use magic on the archers
When he is dead lookdown there is a ledge you can jump to
Then jump towards the left to the side of the mountain to get to the cavern floor
The third tribesman is on the ground around the corner of the rock formation
Take care of him and then climb around on the rocks where you can and pick up the gold and knives that are left behind There is anexit up on the rocks on the right side of the cavern with a big boulder in front of it
You can rsquo t get past it right now but later you will have to come back to thisarea There is a map of this area on the next page
Map of the Cave Trails to Cavern After you search around this area climb through the opening at the other end of the cavern and continue on
Soon you will come to a fork in the trail go to the right
Follow this path and you will come to and intersection
Move slowly you will see some tribesmen just ahead of you You can throw some magic from here and do away with a couple of them
There will also be a tribesman to your right
He is guarding some vase with goodies in them but first take care of business
There are or tribesmen in this area
Your F key comes in handy fighting them
Sometimes when you get close to them they scoot so fast you can rsquo t hit them with your sword so the best thing is to put some distance between you stock up on life and magic and then go looking for them again While you are fighting with them you will her a rumble that is that rock falling down in the cavern After the work is over go down the path to your right if you are not sure which one it is it will be a short one with a jump where the one tribesman was
Jump the opening pick up what they left and then jump down the ledges to get the phials The vase on the left where there are two has a scorpion in it
Map leaving the Cavern stTime After you climb back up from getting the phials go straight ahead and jump the gap and keep going straight There will be a cutoff to your left but angle to the right
You will come to another split trail this time go left there will be a jump to make up ahead and then two ledges to climb
By the way save some of your knives don rsquo t use them all up
Treasury Room When you get on the second ledge you will see Mogamba who has many spells and two of his tribesmen
Use your F key to protect yourself climb up and run and jump your way to them before he throws a spell at you
He is easy to defeat if you get to him fast
If he unleashes a spell it can change you keys when you want to go forward you will go backward etc
Everything does the opposite
Did you ever see so much gold in all your life
There are little bags of gold pieces hidden among the barrels Be sure to find them you will need all the gold you can get
Rescuing Princess Guarana Head back to the cavern and climb up to where the big round boulder came from this is your exit to rescue the Princess Guarana from the dangerous Madusa
Right away when you enter this new tunnel there is a jump to make keep following the path and you will come to slime lake
There are some poles sticking out of the water that you will have to jump to
Line yourself up and go for it when you make it save your game
Line up for the second jump and save again
The third jump is to a tall tree you can broad jump here Now jump to the tree to the right and then the one to the left
Down below you is a very long island
Take a running jump to it Now back up as far as you can and line up to the next tree
When you land on this one it will start to sink turn and quickly jump to the next one and it will start sinking jump to the third and then to some solid ground WHOA what is that
Quick start throwing some of the knives that you saved
That is the only thing that will kill that monster He sure was an ugly monster If you didn rsquo t save any knives you are out of luck nothing else will kill this monster Did you see those teeth
WOW
Now that he is dead go to the right and there are about a few more jumps to make
No more sinking jumps once you get out of this area there will be six ledges to climb and two more opening to jump that are rather close together so be careful
Two more ledges to climb and one more jump and you will be at Medusa rsquo s Cave

The Princess is tied to a stake Now you must be very careful
You can move ahead and hide behind rocks
You can rsquo t let Medusa eyes see your face or you will become a statue Use your F and hold it down until you turn to a gold color
Then give it another tap so you have a shield around you

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
Arachnophobia Walkthrough quot Arachnophobia quot is an arcade style action game pitting you against a previously unknown species of spiders that is lethally poisonous extremely aggressive and strangly intelligent
The U S Department of Agriculture has retained your extermination firm to destroy the deadly Queen spiders and their lethal offspring before they take over the country
Once you have wiped out the threat in the United States the United Nations hires you to destroy an entire herd of South American spiders in the Amazon rain forests
Fast action and loads of spider busting sound effects
With the Sound Source you'll hear sizzling spiders creepy sound effects and blood curdling screams
It's all part of the fun
Supports IBM and compatibles K K with Sound Source CGA TGA MCGA EGA VGAJoystick or Keyboard input Available on x quot or x quot disks Amiga Computers MB of memory required Joystick or Keyboard input Commodore Computers K required Joystick or Keyboard input ARACHNOPHOBIA Finding the Queen Spider LEVEL A Small Clue In each town there is one Queen spider
She is creating new spiders that are taking over the town and terrorizing the inhabitants
In order to quot clean quot the town you must find and kill the Queen
Every location in a town will have an egg sack
When you destroy the egg sack your Bug o meter will tell you the compass direction to find the Queen
Use the directional clues of the Bug o meter to locate the Queen
ARACHNOPHOBIA Finding the Queen Spider LEVEL A Big Hint When you get a direction clue from the Bug O meter use it to your advantage
You should not have to go to every location in a town to find the Queen
You may want to go to each location to sharpen your bug busting skills or to gather additional bug bombs but you should be able to find the Queen's hideout after visiting only a few locations
Say for example you start in the center location and destroy the egg sack and the direction you get says that it came from the southeast
You have now narrowed the possible locations down to two as there are only two locations that are both south AND east of the center location
Now go to one of the locations directly to the east of where you just were
When you destroy that egg sack you will be told another clue that when coupled with your first clue will tell you the exact location of the Queen
Now all you have to do is face her
Good luck you're going to need it
ARACHNOPHOBIA Finding a Flame Thrower LEVEL A Hint In addition to stomping spraying and bug bombing those pesky arachnid invaders you can also use objects found throughout the town to construct a super duper flame thrower the likes of which these creatures have never known
To get a flame thrower find a can usually left on a lower level of a structure and then grab some matches
FWOOSH
You've got a flame thrower
Be wise when you use it however the can only holds enough spray for a limited number of shots
Foolish use may leave you with your trusty but less powerful bug spray right when you need a flame thrower most
One more quick note each flame thrower is good only for the location in which you find it
Once Delbert returns to his truck the flame thrower for that town is gone
ARACHNOPHOBIA Finding a Flame Thrower LEVEL A Big Hint If you are having trouble constructing a flame thrower remember that you must have either the matches first and then locate a can or the can first and then locate the matches in order for the weapon to work
Only one can can be found for each town
Although ARACHNOPHOBIA will place more than one can in each town once one of them is found the rest quot magically quot disappear it's our assumption that spiders got wise and hid the remaining cans from you
There is a way however to tell if a location has a can before you even get the inside
A careful player may learn this on their own through careful observation
If you want to know right now read the LEVEL clue
ARACHNOPHOBIA Finding a Flame Thrower LEVEL The Surest Way In order to know when a particular location contains a can listen to Delbert when he gets out of his truck
The first location he enters in each town will be preceded by him saying something
However if he says something upon entering any location AFTER the first one that is your clue that that is where a can can be found
Once you have the can jump over all sets of matches that you find until you are sure that you are about to face the Queen
That way you'll have a monstrous surprise for her unsuspecting highness when you confront her
Note that there is ALWAYS a set of matches in a room next to where the Queen is lurking so if you already have the can and you know you are in the location where the Queen is hiding be sure to grab the matches and then go after her
Good luck fellow arachnid busters
ARACHNOPHOBIA Killing the Queen Spider LEVEL A Small Hint You must kill the Queen spider in order to move on to the next town and your final conflict with Big Bob and then the grand daddy of them all The General in South America
Once you find the Queen you can use bug spray a flame thrower and bug bombs to kill her
You will have to fire bug spray repeatedly to kill the Queen or give her one good blast with the flame thrower
ARACHNOPHOBIA Killing the Queen Spider LEVEL The Surest Way The best way to kill the Queen is to use the flame thrower
Locate the can in one of the other locations and then pick up the matches before you enter the room with the Queen
There is always a set of matches in a room next to the egg sack but be sure when you are carrying the can that you jump over matches until you are ready to confront the Queen
Once you have picked up the can and the matches and are equipped with the flame thrower give the egg sack one good blast you can be about half way across the room to do this then walk towards the door while the egg sack blows up then turn and give the Queen a good solid shot of flaming munchies to eat
Congratulations on your victory over the evil arachnids and as Delbert would say quot On to the next town quot ARACHNOPHOBIA Winning in South America Level Bug Bombs The key to winning in South America is the proper use of bug bombs
There are two queen spiders that you must defeat before you face the King of the Spiders
Use a single bug bomb to stun the Queen spiders temporarily and then blast away with your bug spray
You only have five bug bombs so using them wisely is the key to winning
If you can stun and spray the first queen several times before the bomb wears off the second bomb that you drop to stun the second queen will kill the first
Then blast the second queen several times with your bug spray until she dies
Once you have killed them you should have three bombs left to do battle with the King of the Spiders
You are going to need them
Use them one at a time to stun him and spray like mad to kill him
Try not to waste shots with your bug spray you are limited you know

Summer of
Somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean a rag tag team of four intrepid explorers descended to the bottom of the ocean in their search to locate and enter the mythological sunken city of Atlantis
However something's gone wrong
Read this already in the manual you say
That's right partner
Never said I liked doin' it the hard way GOODBYE TO SNOWY ENGLAND Well just as I was hanging around the stadium for some good sport journalism I got a call from my editor to get my butt over there a s a p
Anxious about a promotion what else could it be
I ran off
How sorry I felt for myself when I received the news about me going to the Caribbean to hone my skills
Why
I was happy doing the sports pages in snowy England
Now I got to be some Indy or something
Or should it be Kendall Richard Kendall Nah
THE CARIBBEAN Village Square When I arrived over there first thing I saw was some lady painter
I talked to her and got to know she wanted to be called old aunt Judith
Well Jude no problemo
Found out she wanted some fresh water to paint
Got her small pot full of dirty water and took a hike
Beach House First destination on the island was the beach
Fastest way to professor Caldwell's beach house was to the left
I managed to open the lock and enter the shack
Found some interesting stuff there
There was some worn off blue jacket with a piece of fabric missing
Also found some of the prof's note and an ancient Mexican coin with a square hole in it
Also found a dirty cup
Notes were interesting told me something about a discovery Caldwell made with some Simon dude there should be some kind of key under a stone in an old church
The Museum From the beach house I went straight to the museum
Over there I met the curator
Hereally loves his old Mustang wreck
Even worse condition than the rust bucket I flew in on my way to this island
Well inside the museum I found a painting of a guy called Mancusin
Examination is important
Also found some compass
The curator got really nervous when I touched the glass
Must be something special Through the door I reached the gunnery
In there I found a piece of fabric between some stones
This was the piece of fabric that was missing from the blue jacket in Caldwell's cabin
Also examined the skull shield
Then walked on to the library On the table was an ancient book with an ancient letter
Read this letter it's about Mancusin's mysterious escapes in the past
Leave and go to the gallery
Examined the compass again now noticed the pointer points east
Saw enough and left
The Pier At the pier I met an old sailor
He told me he's a descendant of the pirate Mancusin and he showed me the tattoo only he and his brother have a white dolphin with the motto 'Viva the south wind '
Heard that one before
Talking to this sailor and showing him the letter I found in the museum's library gave me a lot of info
The sailor told me about the legend of Mancusin and his pirates always able to escape without a trace in the fortress
He also told me he took the Prof and his crew out to the Bermuda Islands
There he used a research ship and a bathyscaph to explore the ocean
But he was never seen again Got a magnet from the sailor
It was dropped by the Professor when they embarked their research vessel
The Museum In the museum I went to the library
I opened the window and poured the pot of dirty water out of the window on the car
As soon as I heard the curator wining about his car I went down and used the magnet on the compass in the gallery
The pointer now turned south
Hey viva the south wind
I ran off to the gunnery and turned the skull and bones shield
Guess what a secret passage opened
Grabbed the piece of blue cloth that had been stuck between it and went down
A Secret Hiding Place Yuck
Stuffy around here
Anyway I stumbled upon some ancient stuff here
I opened a trunk and found a parchment with Mancusin's sign on it
On the table I found a manuscript from Christopher Columbus himself
Some mysterious script old Chris wrote down Also found a dagger lying on the table
Jute bags and kegs contained nothing valuable I left the museum and went to the gum tree in front of it
I stuck the dagger in it and put the gum resin from the tree into the dirty cup I found in Caldwell's beach house Then I went to the fountain and emptied the pot of dirty water in the fountain
Then I used the Mexican coin on the fountain tap followed by using the fountain tap
Finally the water flowed
Then I used the empty pot on the fountain and I got a pot full of clean water
The Pier I left the museum and went straight to the pier
I had the coordination now and I was sure Caldwell went there as well
I asked the sailor to take me there but he refused to take me there
I talked to him and I insisted on him taking me there
But he wouldn't do it as long as his favorite crab Tweezers wasn't with him
Man he must have had to many sunburn for his own good
But as he was an ancestor of some crazy pirate everything was possible
So I told him I was going to find this Tweezers
Thankful guy as he was he gave me Tweezers favorite food and off I went
The Beach House In front of the beach house is a flat rock with some crabs on it
I went down to the rock and poured the gum resin on the rock
Then I put Tweezers food on the gum resin and waited for the crab to get stuck
Grabbed the crab and went off to the vill square
Village Square Went to old aunt Judith and gave her the pot of water
Then I asked her to paint my freshly caught crab white
She guzzles down all my rum but hey I got my own Tweezers now
Went to the pier and gave good ol' Tweezers to the sailor
Thankful guy as he was he took me to the place I wanted to go
I had to dive to find the bathyscaph in which I found the black box in the secret compartment
I also saw a great stone portal to the right of the rope Atlantis
Wowsers
Time to tell that slavedriver in London
AVON ENGLAND Newspaper Office Just when I thought all this had ended that slavedriver had this great idea to send me to another place to investigate Caldwell's disappearance
No way Jose'
Okay well losing my job isn't all that great
either
So there I went again
Another rust bucket another place another mystery to be unraveled
The Church In Avon Near the well I found a bucket with a hole in it
Took it anyway
Then I met a little girl called Polly Jane and her cat Attila
She was too busy to talk to me
I left ant walked around the church to the farm
I used the piece of cloth I had with the gum resin
The cup holding the gum resin broke but I got a sticky cloth to use on the bucket to repair it
Then I used the bucket to get some milk from the dairy cow
Took the bucket to Atilla and gave him some milk
As Polly Jane was too busy picking fruit I took Atilla and threw him into the broken church window
That drew Polly Jane's attention
She took the ladder to rescue her little kitten and left it after that
I used the ladder to get into the church
The Church Once I was inside I removed the door bolt from the oak door
Also picked up the urn with ashes
Then I used the door bolt on the confessional to reveal a secret passage
Went down and found some archeological diggings
Another step down between piles of sand took me to the tomb Spooky
Inside the tomb I saw a sculpted picture of Stonehenge with some hieroglyphics beneath it
I was sure those hieroglyphics would prove to be most interesting so I made a copy for my editor to translate
To make a copy I used the professor's notes on the hieroglyphics to make a copy
The ash made a good ink
There also was a large stone head which I examined
Last thing to explore was an alcove
This must be the place where Caldwell found his key the stone he mentioned in his writings After I explored everything I left the church but then suddenly the weather changed without reason
I went back in the church and found a strange octagon object green with shiny pieces Newspaper Office I ran off to London to give my editor the copy of the encrypted message
He told me it was an ancient Tuareg dialect
Oh no that means I yeah off to Tammanrasset Algeria to meet Prince Amir
Here we go again
DESERT FORT ALGERIA Got to the tent at the lower side of the screen and got in
Talked to the bloke and got thrown out almost immediately
So far for local hospitality
Tried talking to the woman the beautiful Lallah in front of the other tent
Then went to the fort and talked to the prisoner
He told me about the Holy Man of the Mountain who could help me translate the glyphs from the British tomb
He gave me a ring as a token of our friendship
Took this ring back to Lallah the prisoner's wife and she gave you permission to look inside the tent as I now am a friend of her husband's
In the tent you can see shreds of a pot and a hole in the tent caused by a bullet
Now go outside and talk to Lallah again
She'll tell you about a crash that woke her
Enter the tent again and look at the base of the pole actually named as this
and see the bullet and the line the bullet followed through the hole
This points to the top of the fort's turret
Go talk to Lallah again and get some food for her husband
Go to the other tent and talk to the injured guy who tells you a snake scared his dromedary after which it decided to run away
Some clue but be patient
Enter the fort again and bring the food to the prisoner
There's a picklock in it on which he nearly breaks his teeth when you ask him how the food was
As it's no good for him why should it he's only locked after all
Leave the fort and go to the map
Choose the freshly placed mountain as your new destination
AHAGGAR MOUNTAIN ALGERIA Look at the tire marks from the jeep
Enter the building and talk to the Holy Man
He'll tell you about a stolen gem taken from him by a man with an eye patch
He took off south in a jeep
Now ask this guy about the rubbings try to get conversation on translating
After some lengthy conversation again he'll tell about a strange object from a church
Must be the green object I've found in Avon
Went to the strange door and the green object a Levitium Finder started buzzin'
Old man told me this was the entrance to the Cave of Mysteries
Exit and use the tire tracks to go to the village
TAMMANRASSET VILLAGE ALGERIA In the village I entered some smelly butcher's shop with a camel sign near the door
There was some rat bait and a little bottle I couldn't take without having an argument with the shopkeeper
Ask him about the rat bait
He offered me some disgusting rat croquette I just took out of pure decency
Then I ran off to the square behind the building
There was some guy which asked me to play a game with
As there was no reason I went on to the cave area and selected Easter Island as my next destination
EASTER ISLAND PACIFIC OCEAN I went to those famous statues and walked on to a hut
Tobias the sailor's petty thief bro was there
I asked him about the island
Then I went to the lighthouse picking up a shell necklace from the first statue as I went by them
In front of the lighthouse I took a glass jar from a stone marker and went back to Tobias' hut
He gave me a picture of the island
Took a rubber tube myself found it near the petrol can
As I wasn't progressing much till now I showed him the Mancussin paper and the rubbings from the Avon tomb
When he cracked his memory took a while he pointed me the cave of giant bats
I went there left of your screen and found a termite hill
As the sounds from the cave scared me shitless I decided to do some other animal thing and captured those nice little termites into my glass jar
Then I left for the airport destination STONEHENGE ENGLAND I walked north to the worker's shack leaving Stonehenge to my right
I had some pleasant conversation with this bloke telling me his tractor broke down
I smiled to him and then in a brief moment of indiscretion I opened the door with the picklock
A metal file from the table and the plumb line from the boxes in the corner were all I found
Time to head back to the desert
DESERT FORT ALGERIA Talked to Lallah again
She didn't know the sacred word for the cave but only those belonging to the royal family have knowledge so she told me
I talked to the prisoner again and he told me the magic word but only after making him a deal to save him
So that's the mission from now on
Go outside and make a fake snake from the plumb line the shell necklace and the rubber tube
Use this little rattler on the dromedary and scare him away
Go to the tent of the man with the injured foot and tell him his dromedary ran off
He'll tell you to go to the bazaar
Do so and deliver the message to the merchant over there
Leave and take the little dish of dog food from the other cage on the fort square
Return to the tent of the injured man and get his shoe
Look at the rifle that's there
AHAGGAR MOUNTAIN ALGERIA Go to the door and use the file on it to get some Levitium filings
Exit the cave and got to the map
Pick as you next destination RUM CAY ISLAND THE CARIBBEAN Talk to the lady painter twice and give her the picture of Easter Island and the Mancussin parchment at last
She'll make a an excellent first class fake treasure map where X marks the spot
Go to the pier and talk to Tobias' brother the sailor
He'll be really glad to hear you've found that slippery worm
Well for brotherhood
TAMMANRASSET VILLAGE ALGERIA Go to the village and enter the butcher shop again
I really had some fun over there with the camel stake on the counter
The termites from the glass jar make some combo with the meat it made the butcher faint
I snatched away the rat bait and the little bottle of narcotics and ran off
DESERT FORT ALGERIA Inside the fort I mixed the narcotic powder with the small dish of dog food and gave it to the dog inside the bazaar
Then I took the small safe from the counter before passing going through the door
There I found a larger safe I couldn't open at that time and a chest
Removing the chest revealed a secret passageway to the top of the turret
Pick up the silencer and take the steps
Up there I found a cartridge case and a telescope lens
I used the shoe I stole from the tent onto the footsteps and they matched Dromedary Dick was the killer instead of Prince Amir
I went downstairs and talked to the guard
I handed over all the evidence and finally he freed the Prince when his innocence was proved
EASTER ISLAND PACIFIC OCEAN Go to Tobias' hut and give him the small blue safe to open it
The combination is Use the safe to open it and get the key inside of it
DESERT FORT ALGERIA Got to the fort and use the key I found in the safe on the jeep parked near the cells
Took the contents being a drive belt and some flares
License plate is
Hey wasn't the safe combo
Entered the bazaar and heard the two crooks talk to eachother
Followed them as they walked through a door and heard them talk about a contract which they hid in the great safe
As they left I opened the safe with the other half of the combo
To open the safe set each dial on the number acquired and pull the lever
Then take the contract out
Outside I talked to the guard and gave him the rifle
Gave him the silencer as well
I told him about the plot and the contract
Finally he gave me the key to free Prince Amir and he gave me the magic words to the cave Open Sesame
Wow some point for creativity here
AHAGGAR MOUNTAIN ALGERIA Gave the secret word to the old man and entered the inner cave
Heard the story about Gods falling from the sky
STONEHENGE ENGLAND Went straight to the construction yard into the shack to give the drive belt to the worker
He's rushing to call his wife so I had all the time in the world to leave the shack and use the tractor's lever to lift the stone
I entered the pit and the underground room
A thin bronze tube a cracked crystal and a strange green object were stuff collected from there
AVON ENGLAND Got back to the pit below the church and got myself a rat from below the stairs or at the iron bars at the right end of the dirt floor
Used the rat bait to catch it
RUM CAY ISLAND CARRIBEAN Go to the village square and get the picture from the lady painter
EASTER ISLAND PACIFIC OCEAN Lighthouse was my destination where I could use the flares on the lamp holder
I turned the handle to switch the light on but darn one of Tobias' balloons blocked the path of the light
Go to Tobias and give him the painting being actually a fake treasure map
He leaves and you can enter the hut
Get the chrome paint spray the glass shard window above washing machine and the car jack
Leave the hut and deflate the balloon by using the gas burner

Find Tobias again and see he actually found his treasure
AHAGGAR MOUNTAIN ALGERIA Talk to the Holy Man and tell him you know the secret word
Then he'll open the door
Use the Magnetium object from Stonehenge on the hole in the mechanism
It doesn't work
Now the man should tell you about the sacred gem that was stolen
TAMMANRASSET ALGERIA Go back to the village and use the lens on the rusty hole on the jeep
Go to the square and play the game with the crook
When you hear a big bang the tire blew
the guy will leave
He will not come back until you take the special snuff box from under the dirty cup and use the Levitium filings with it
Put it back under the cup and the man will come back
This time play the game with him and you use the Levitium finder with the snuff box to find it's position
Do this for as long as you can then leave
If you play the game long enough he will give you the sacred Ahmarat mainly automatic sequence
AHAGGAR MOUNTAIN ALGERIA Return to the cave and go to the strange machines inside
Use the helmet and see a confession made by some alien an Atlantean
After that go to the compartment and take the medallion with the red stone out
Insert the medallion from the bat cave with the green stone in it
Use the helmet again and hear another story
Use the parchment from the tomb and find coordinates from Yucatan you can go there now
Open the compartment again and take the medallion out
Now put the medallion from the church in England with the black stone in it
You now learn how to recharge the Levitium finder at Stonehenge
YUCATAN CENTRAL AMERICA Go to the Mystic's hut past the sunbleached rock and flowers
Look at the marks on the stone idol outside the hut and talk to the man
He tells you that you should come back with a precise question
Go back to the forest and go to the pyramid click above the rock on the left side
Go inside the pyramid and see the buttons to control up down right and left
Return to the Mystic's hut and tell him what you've discovered
He tells you what you need to enter the pyramid a yellow flower a snake an egg of a bird and a bone of an animal cursed by man
So nothing real difficult
To get the yellow flower return to the wood
Use the chrome paint spray on the glass shard to make a mirror and put it on the sun bleached rock
This will divert the sun beams and color the white flower into a yellow one
To get the egg return to the pyramid and see a nest hanging up in the trees
Use the thin bronze tube with the cartridge and make a make shift blow pipe
Use it with the nest and it will fall down
Take the egg out
To get the snake use the rat you took from the church in England
Use the rat with the boa and take this slippery friend with you
TAMMANRASSET ALGERIA Go to the butcher and look at the thigh bone
Talk to the butcher and buy the bone
This is the bone of an animal cursed by man so this makes it the last item you need
YUCATAN CENTRAL AMERICA Go to the Mystic and give him the bone and the other objects he asked for
Finally you'll have a flute to use on the marks on the idol
It'll give you the secret code for the pyramid's door
Go to the pyramid and move the mechanism up up right up up down
This opens the back door of the pyramid
Go there and enter
Look at the painting of a medallion thrown into the water
Return to the Mystic and ask him about this

Look at the stone idol and especially watch the faces on it
Go to the Mystic and tell him he's free to get some treasures from the lake
As soon as he's left enter his hut and open the trunk
Get the face stone cubes
Then return to the inner chamber of the pyramid where you found the painting
You should now place the stone cubes in the door portals
Left of the door the top should be two smiling faces looking inwards and the bottom should be two frowns facing outwards
Right of the door the top should be two frowns facing outwards and the bottom should be two smiles facing inwards
The right combo opens the door at the top of the stairs outside
Go there and see the Mayan heads along the walls
Touch a crystal in one of the mouths and see the color is changing Return to the Mystic and ask him about this
He'll give you a medallion purple stone
AHAGGAR MOUNTAIN ALGERIA Go to the reading compartment and use the purple stone medallion on it
Use the helmet and hear Pol Ro's story
This transmission tells you that to enter his tomb you need the Levitium finder fully charged and you need to solve the logic problem of the colored crystals in heads on walls in the pyramid
Remove the medallion from the compartment
If you click on it in inventory it'll repeat instructions
YUCATAN CENTRAL AMERICA Go to the top room of the pyramid and set the colored crystals

GAME BOOMER'S Hints Cheats and Walkthroughs
ARMED amp DELIRIOUS WALKTHRU's Also entitled Dementia and originally Granny Len Green Sept updated July ' lt lengreen hotmail com This game is both totally zany and quite complex
Others may wantminimalhelp amp or hints
These players should use the Bare Bones Walkthru
Some may want acompletedescription of what to do for whenever they need it during the game
These players should use the Full Walkthru This latter containsnot onlythe actions youMUSTperform but also a few which are not essential for finishing the game but provide alotof incidental fun
Both walkthru's have been arranged with identically numbered sections
In this way anyone who chooses the Bare Bones Walkthru and getsreallystuck or frustrated need only go to the same numbered section in the Full Walkthru to get over the obstacle
Some players like to have printed walkthru's complete or just excerpts of trouble spots for ease of use and so as not to have to exit the game at all if any problems arise
Each walkthru was written in WinWord Doc format and utilizes several colors for extra clarity
Both have been designed so that in addition to a color printer they can also be printed perfectly comprehensibly on a black and white printer
Two versions are available one in point for very comfortable reading and the other in point which nearly halves the pages of hard copy but being smaller is much more difficult to read There is also a converted version in point HTML
Disclaimer These walkthru's were made before the game was officially released and corrections alterations have doubtless been made since then th July ' I haven't noticed any in the final commercial version
These may lead to discrepancies re the final version probably only minor ones ARMED amp DELIRIOUS Also entitled Dementia and originally Granny BARE BONES WALKTHRU Len Green Sept updated July ' lt lengreen hotmail com With grateful appreciation toEyal Kaduriwho made the excellent original version upon which this was almost completely based toTom Feinerfor advice amp help and to other members of Makh shevet for their assistance
INTRODUCTION
Armed amp Delirious Dementia is a unique Quest Adventure Game from several points of view and well worth the effort of playing through to its conclusion
It is almost completely 'open ended' and there are six Main Worlds to explore almost all containingmanySub Worlds
Armed amp Delirious as its name infers is pretty wacky and hence somewhat difficult for all us sane
gamers to follow Anybody who manages to do soabsolutely withoutANYwalkthru cheat sheet hints or help fromanybodyREALLY deserves a prize maybe the Distributors will send you one haha
But some lesser mortals may want just a little or maybe quite a lot of assistance
To that end there areTWOwalkthru's For very experienced Quest players who only need asmall amountof help here and there there is the Bare Bones Walkthru
This walkthru tells you the BESTorderin which to proceed without having to revisit Worlds and Sub Worlds any more than essential and saves quite a bit of time since they are spread over the five CD Rom's which have to be changed frequently It also tells youallthe inventory items youmustcollect at each site and there are several dozen altogether
However it does NOT tell you how or exactly where to get them or inanyway how or where to use them so it doesn't completely rob you of the satisfaction of 'doing your own thing'
If at a particular site you arestillstuck and there are several pretty tricky places like this and you haven't got the time or patience to solve the problem yourself you can always go to the identical numbered section of the Full Walkthru which tells you in clear detailexactlywhat to do If however you do not wish to play the game completely withoutanyassistance nor even 'waste time' with the Bare Bones Walkthru there is the Full Walkthru which is aVERYgreatly amplified version and which tells youeverythingyou need to do and more
and inextremelygreat detail IMPORTANT NOTE You can of course visit all the Worlds and Sub Worlds in ANY order you choose
You canalwaysmove ahead but generally only up to a certain limited point since you are probably missing an essential item you need from somewhere else
So you often have to do quite a lot ofsuperfluous'going backwards and forwards' you have to do quite a lot of thisanyhow even using either walkthru
However if you stickexclusivelyto either walkthru you will definitely be able tofinishthe game and via the 'most efficient path' But you will miss quite a large number of comic antics and a lot of amusing dialogue these frequently are of a partially random nature and hence do not necessarily repeat themselves identically each time but often vary according to your previous actions and those of Granny
So feel free to 'go your own way' It's worth mentioning that even these two walkthru's are not theVERYminimumyou need to do in order to finish the game
At many of the sites it is hinted that whilst you Granny
are there you may as well want to do something which turns out to be not actuallyessentialto continue the game and finish it e g
at Observe Granny's 'reading habits' and note

Even though such actions are 'redundant' to thefinaloutcome of the game you'll miss some fun if you don't perform them whilst you've been forced to go to the trouble of actuallygettingto these places and you'll only shorten your wanderings by averyfew percent
Incidentally you can usually guess when such 'superfluous suggestions' occur since they are generally incorporated into a section where thereissomething you HAVEtodoin order to continue andevery single actionyouMUSTdodoeshave its own individual numbered section PREFACE As written in the booklets and walkthru's of most Quests pick up every item you can that is not actually 'nailed down' you'll need itall almost later on
InBOTHwalkthru's all the inventory items you mustobtainare highlighted inbold blueand underlined
In the Full Walkthru only the ones you mustuseare inregular blueand not underlined
You are NEVER told which items to use or where in the Bare Bones Walkthru
In this game Granny stores all her inventory items in her bra amp
So from here onwards your inventory is referred to as yourBRAVENTORY
As in all Quest Adventure games saveVERYFREQUENTLY Youneverget 'killed' in this game thank goodness
but you can VERY easily 'get lost'
Unlike many games A
amp
D isfullyadapted to Windows ' ' and so there isabsolutely NOlimit to thenumberof Saves you can make
If as some do you favor longish descriptions of your Saves no problem they can be almost unlimited in length there are some restrictions imposed by Windows ' ' e g no front or back slashes and no colons or asterisks etc
but they areveryfew and very easily spotted and avoided
There are a few places where the timing is fairly critical and you may have to repeat a few times before getting it right before thesespecialsituations arise you are recommended in green to S A V E There are also a very few places where the actions are somewhat complex or 'unclear' and going back involves the bother of changing back to previous CD Rom's and hence it may beadvisableto save these places are marked in green s a v e In Armed amp Delirious Dementia there is a gimmick practically unknown in any other Quest Adventure
You VERY frequently have todragan object in a special direction or to a certain place
The Bare Bones Walkthru does not tell youwhatto drag how orwhere but since you might overlook this action every site in which youdohave to drag something is marked inBOTHwalkthru's with a red asterisk e g
drag amp also the instruction section number is highlighted in red e g
The tape recorder gives you some 'demented' hints at many of the sites you visit
You can rewind fast forward play and stop as desired
In some screens you are informed that the tape recorder is not functioning intentionally those programmers
for one reason or another obviously you get no 'info' from the tape recorder in those screens Whenever you right click on a braventory item you obtain a large mobile illustration of the item and a usually zany written description of it amp or its use
These descriptions often contain obscure hints as to where how you will have to use the item in the future Usually it is very clear both visually and audibly whenever you obtain a new braventory item
Occasionally however you can pick up somethingwithout being aware of it so to avoid repeating actions and wasting time check Granny's braventory from time to time
The opposite can also happen albeit rarely and youimaginethat you have obtained an item whereas in reality you haven't
This can be very annoying since at a later stage when you actuallyneedthe braventory item you may have to return to another World and Sub World and often have to change CD's twice in the process Bottom line WHENEVER youhave got or hope to have got a new braventory item it is well worth the extra few seconds tocheck to make certain and also to view it in close up When you get the map you can travel to the different Worlds and Sub Worlds In order to save time later here are some general notes and the appellations used it iswell worth whiledrawing your own simpleroughcircular diagram for easy reference you will need it during thewholeof the game and the couple of minutes it takes to draw will save youverymuch more time later on in the game
On the map the Worlds are situated on a circular track and Granny always travels in an anti clockwise direction
In the following description the numbers inside the 'curly parentheses' refer to the serial numbers of the CD Rom's concerned not really necessary
Granny's villa is pretty obviously situated in the middle of the left hand circumference of this circle
Traveling anti clockwise from the villa the other Worlds are marked in violet thus A B C D amp E Thevillaitself A amp B don't contain any Sub Worlds
The last only contain Sub Worlds as follows Cconsists of C which is the right hand square trapdoor closed and with a hinged lid

INTRODUCTION
Armed amp Delirious Dementia is a unique Quest Adventure Game from several points of view and well worth the effort of playing through to its conclusion
It is almost completely 'open ended' and there are six Main Worlds to explore almost all containingmanySub Worlds
Armed amp Delirious as its name infers is pretty wacky and hence somewhat difficult for all us sane
gamers to follow
Anybody who manages to do soabsolutely withoutANYwalkthru cheat sheet hints or help fromanybodyREALLY deserves a prize maybe the Distributors will send you one haha
But some lesser mortals may want just a little or maybe quite a lot of assistance
To that end there areTWOwalkthru's For very experienced Quest players who only need asmall amountof help here and there there is the Bare Bones Walkthru
This walkthru tells you the BESTorderin which to proceed without having to revisit Worlds and Sub Worlds any more than essential and saves quite a bit of time since they are spread over the five CD Rom's which have to be changed frequently It also tells youallthe inventory items youmustcollect at each site and there are several dozen altogether
However it does NOT tell you how or exactly where to get them or inanyway how or where to use them so it doesn't completely rob you of the satisfaction of 'doing your own thing'
If at a particular site you arestillstuck and there are several pretty tricky places like this and you haven't got the time or patience to solve the problem yourself you can always go to the identical numbered section of the Full Walkthru which tells you in clear detailexactlywhat to do If however you do not wish to play the game completely withoutanyassistance nor even 'waste time' with the Bare Bones Walkthru there is the Full Walkthru which is aVERYgreatly amplified version and which tells youeverythingyou need to do and more
and inextremelygreat detail IMPORTANT NOTE You can of course visit all the Worlds and Sub Worlds in ANY order you choose
You canalwaysmove ahead but generally only up to a certain limited point since you are probably missing an essential item you need from somewhere else
So you often have to do quite a lot ofsuperfluous 'going backwards and forwards' you have to do quite a lot of thisanyhow even using either walkthru
However if you stickexclusivelyto either walkthru you will definitely be able tofinishthe game and via the 'most efficient path' But you will miss quite a large number of comic antics and a lot of amusing dialogue these frequently are of a partially random nature and hence do not necessarily repeat themselves identically each time but often vary according to your previous actions and those of Granny
So feel free to 'go your own way' It's worth mentioning that even these two walkthru's are not theVERYminimumyou need to do in order to finish the game
At many of the sites it is hinted that whilst you Granny
are there you may as well want to do something which turns out to be not actuallyessentialto continue the game and finish it e g
at Observe Granny's 'reading habits' and note

Even though such actions are 'redundant' to thefinaloutcome of the game you'll miss some fun if you don't perform them whilst you've been forced to go to the trouble of actuallygettingto these places and you'll only shorten your wanderings by averyfew percent
Incidentally you can usually guess when such 'superfluous suggestions' occur since they are generally incorporated into a section where thereissomething you HAVEtodoin order to continue andevery single actionyouMUSTdodoeshave its own individual numbered section PREFACE As written in the booklets and walkthru's of most Quests pick up every item you can that is not actually 'nailed down' you'll need itall almost later on
InBOTHwalkthru's all the inventory items you mustobtainare highlighted inbold blueand underlined
In the Full Walkthru only the ones you mustuseare inregular blueand not underlined
You are NEVER told which items to use or where in the Bare Bones Walkthru
In this game Granny stores all her inventory items in her bra amp

You VERY frequently have todragan object in a special direction or to a certain place

The tape recorder gives you some 'demented' hints at many of the sites you visit
You can rewind fast forward play and stop as desired
In some screens you are informed that the tape recorder is not functioning intentionally those programmers
for one reason or another obviously you get no 'info' from the tape recorder in those screens Whenever you right click on a braventory item you obtain a large mobile illustration of the item and a usually zany written description of it amp or its use
These descriptions often contain obscure hints as to where how you will have to use the item in the future Usually it is very clear both visually and audibly whenever you obtain a new braventory item
Occasionally however you can pick up somethingwithout being aware of it so to avoid repeating actions and wasting time check Granny's braventory from time to time
The opposite can also happen albeit rarely and youimaginethat you have obtained an item whereas in reality you haven't
This can be very annoying since at a later stage when you actuallyneedthe braventory item you may have to return to another World and Sub World and often have to change CD's twice in the process Bottom line WHENEVER youhave got or hope to have got a new braventory item it is well worth the extra few seconds tocheck to make certain and also to view it in close up When you get the map you can travel to the different Worlds and Sub Worlds In order to save time later here are some general notes and the appellations used it iswell worth whiledrawing your own simpleroughcircular diagram for easy reference you will need it during thewholeof the game and the couple of minutes it takes to draw will save youverymuch more time later on in the game
On the map the Worlds are situated on a circular track and Granny always travels in an anti clockwise direction
In the following description the numbers inside the 'curly parentheses' refer to the serial numbers of the CD Rom's concerned not really necessary
Granny's villa is pretty obviously situated in the middle of the left hand circumference of this circle
Traveling anti clockwise from the villa the other Worlds are marked in violet thus A B C D amp E Thevillaitself A amp B don't contain any Sub Worlds
The last only contain Sub Worlds as follows Cconsists of C which is the right hand square trapdoor closed and with a hinged lid
For very experienced Quest players who only need asmall amountof help here and there there is the Bare Bones Walkthru
This walkthru tells you the BESTorderin which to proceed without having to revisit Worlds and Sub Worlds any more than essential and saves quite a bit of time since they are spread over the five CD Rom's which have to be changed frequently It also tells youallthe inventory items youmustcollect at each site and there are several dozen altogether
However it does NOT tell you how or exactly where to get them or inanyway how or where to use them so it doesn't completely rob you of the satisfaction of 'doing your own thing'
If at a particular site you arestillstuck and there are several pretty tricky places like this and you haven't got the time or patience to solve the problem yourself you can always go to the identical numbered section of the Full Walkthru which tells you in clear detailexactlywhat to do
IMPORTANT NOTE You can of course visit all the Worlds and Sub Worlds in ANY order you choose
You canalwaysmove ahead but generally only up to a certain limited point since you are probably missing an essential item you need from somewhere else

Look at the three vases in the bottom of the screen take the vase to right and pick up some dirt from the bag on the left and put it in the vase and then pick up some more dirt but don't put it in the vase
Go back to the glass case and put in the vase and if the light doesn't turn green then take the vase and put in the extra dirt and put it back in the case

She used to be a care giver for a man who was the projectionist at the move theater
Patti tells a long story about some kids rsquo mischief and a key to the grating
Now you are getting somewhere
She adds that the key was hidden inside the foot rest
Look again at the end of the footrest and click the cap to remove it
You can rsquo t reach what is in there so use the fork with gum
Click the fork with gum in inventory to get akey
Go back to the ladies rsquo room and try the key on the padlock
The lock is too rusty
You could use the oil bottle but it is empty
Return to the bar and ask the bartender for someoil
Go back to the ladies rsquo room and in inventory use the oil on the key
Use the key on the padlock and click the grating to open it
Enter the yard behind the theater
Go down left to the other side of the yard
Take thebucket thebricks and therod
In inventory place the bricks in the bucket
Go back to the first side of the yard and climb the stairs
The door is locked and the handle is missing
Place the screwdriver into the handle hole
Then use the rod on the window to climb up and prop it open
Climb through the window to enter the theater
Take areeland the smallscrewdriverfrom the table at the bottom left
Take thekeyfrom the box right of the control room door
Enter that door into the projection booth
Go to the work table at the left and look at it
Take theempty reel
Note the film container with your name on it
Take the film container and click it to obtain areel of film
Obviously you want to view this film
Open the rewinding machine above the work table and place an empty reel on the right side
Place the reel with film on the left side
Look at the crank to see that there is only a hole in the end and no handle
Place the small screwdriver in the hole and then use the crank to wind the film on to the larger reel
Take the large reel with film from the right side
Look at the projector on the right and then look at the projector lamp cover
Click the handle and see that there is no bulb
You just happen to have one so insert it in the bulb space
Close the cover and back away
See that there are two reel spaces one above the projector and one below
Look at the top one and press the left button to open the cover
Place the film on reel in this space and close the cover
Back away and in the same way open the lower reel space
Put the empty reel here close the cover and back away You can try the switch but there is no power to the projector
Back away and look at the amplifier in the upper left corner of the screen
Click the switch to turn it on
Return to the projector and try the switch again
Ugh nothing is ever easy
Back away and look at the other projector
Open the bulb cover and take thebulb
Return to the first projector open the bulb cover remove the old bulb insert the new bulb close the cover and back away twice
Note the small window in front of the projector
You need to open it
Look at the window and click the handle to slide the cover away
The window pane needs to be cleaned
In inventory use the spray bottle on the paper towels and then use the soaked towel to clean the window
If you now try the switch you realize that the screen is covered up
Apparently the curtain in the auditorium is down and you need to raise it
Leave the control room and descend the stairs on the right to the auditorium level
Note Even with the to show hot spots you can easily go crazy trying to find your way around this very dark auditorium level
I paused here went to the Options Graphic Settings and temporarily set the gamma correction way up
Suit yourself
Note that the curtain is indeed down
Go up to the back room
Take theflashlightfrom the stack of reels and pick up the largemetal wheel
Look at the curtain mechanism on the left and place the metal wheel on the ratchet
Left click hold and continuously drag the wheel clockwise until you hear a grating sound
Unfortunately the wheel just slides back to its original position
You need something to hold it in place
Turn the wheel again until you hear the sound and then quickly place the bucket with bricks on the handle
The curtains part
Leave the back room and come down screen to the hall
Enter the control room and look at the projector
Click the switch and watch the movie
If you have played the first two Art of Murder games you will recognize many of the scenes
However two clues appear in the film that are important
One was a large rectangular grid
The other was the symbol that you first saw on the package wrapper a rectangle inside another rectangle and an exclamation point
This time though the letters ldquo V d rdquo appear inside the symbol
Note It seems natural that you would want to retrieve the film from the lower reel space but we get one of those exasperating situations Art of Murder is famous for
ldquo I can always come back and get it later rdquo Leave the control room and head back downstairs to the auditorium
Go to the theater exit on the right and look at the board to the right of the door
It is the seating plan for the auditorium
It looks like the grid you saw in the movie and you also see the now familiar symbol
Because the letters ldquo V d rdquo appeared in the movie they must be connected to this seating plan
Note that the rows are labeled with Roman numerals so the ldquo V rdquo must refer to the th row
The seating plan uses regular numbers to label the seats in each row but the symbol shows a ldquo d rdquo which must mean seat
Apparently there is something special about row seat
Back away return to the auditorium aisle and go to the Auditorium
You are now facing the seats just as you would with the seating plan
Count back rows and click the th seat from the left
You get apiece of metal
Rotate it in the large view and see a train ticket attached Take theticketand see that it is for today rsquo s train
There is something foreboding about that train
Come down and left to the theater exit
Use the piece of metal on the door and exit the theater
A car has stalled on the train tracks and it is crushed by an oncoming train
Open the metal box in front of you and see a camera and some evidence bags
You can rsquo t take any of this until you need them
Talk to Wang the FBI lab technician kneeling on the right
You don rsquo t believe this was an accident
Take theblock of concretebeneath the yellow police ribbon
Talk to Williams the uniformed police officer and to Patti who is not helpful
Exit right to the platform
Go to the trash container at the right and take thecopper tube
Go up to the tracks and notice the clock
Return to the platform and then exit down the stairs on the lower right
Go down at the lower right and see the train stopped with the barriers down
Look at the end of the left barrier and see a card
You won rsquo t take it until it has been documented
Look at the tall metal box on the left and see that it has a square lock Look at the manhole cover and see that there is a square shape in the center hole
Maybe you can make a tool
Insert the copper tube into the hole and then wham it down with the block of concrete
Take the pipe and look at it in the large view
Perfect
Now use the tool on the lock of the metal box
Click the tube a couple of times to open the box
There is a clipping inside
You need that camera
Return to the far end of the platform and talk to Wang
Open the metal box and take thecameraand someevidence bags
Go back to the rail crossing and take a photo of the playing card on the barrier
Then use an evidence bag to collect theplaying card
Go to the metal control box take a photo of the clipping and use an evidence bag to collect theclipping
Take a photo of the symbol that is on top of the metal box
You need a photo of the seating plan so return to the theater and enter through the side door behind the police car
Look at the seating plan next to the entrance and take a photo
Go through the auditorium and go to the hall
Enter the control room and retrieve thefilm reelfrom the lower reel space
Leave the control room go back downstairs and leave the theater
Go back to the far end of the platform and place the camera and remaining evidence bags back into the box
Talk with Wang
Finally talk with Patti to offer her a ride
October FBI Office Bronx Talk to Wang
He describes how the car could have been stalled electronically and how the doors could have been locked shut remotely
An expert confirms your suspicions that this was a murder
Wang hands you a paper found in the car
Break off your conversation and look at it Holland Street pm
Resume talking to Wang
He hasn rsquo t had time yet to examine the card found by the tracks
You want to scan evidence in the database but you must process the information on your own computer
Go to the work table left of Wang
Take thebagged playing card somegloves and somesmallbags
Move over to the scanner on the left and open the lid
Use the gloves on the bagged jack of hearts and place the card on the scanner bed
Close the lid and press the blue button to scan one side of the card
Use the right click rotation to turn the card over and repeat the scan
Retrieve the card and place it in a small bag
Return to the work table and place the evidence back where you found it
Leave the lab and meet Jason Emmerick the expert Wang mentioned
He is certain the car was sabotaged
Emmerick will write an analysis
He wants your card to contact you so you head for your office to get one
Go to your desk at the right
Take yourFBI cardand thebusiness cards but they belong to your old partner Nick Romsky
Go talk to him at the back of the office
He is packing up to leave
He is bitter and wants to set up his own private detective business
He packed yourcalling cardsby mistake and gives them back to you
Leave the office and head down the stairs to find Emmerick
You give him your card
Go back to your office and look around
Look at the map on the wall and use the switch along the left edge to turn the map light on and off
Exit and come down to the secretary rsquo s office
Talk to Ruth who knows no more about Nick rsquo s leaving that you do
She reminds you that you need shooting practice
Go back into the lab and talk with Wang
You need to use his terminal but he wants a favor from you Do his shooting practice for him
You don rsquo t have much choice so you takeWang rsquo s card
Go downstairs and back to the rooms in the corner
Use Wang rsquo s card on the door to the shooting range and enter
Look at the monitor and then enter the booth
Pick up the gun and observe the wavering motion to get a feel for when to fire
Keep firing until you decide you have done enough
Use the switch on the left to move the target forward and see how you Wang did
You still need to do your own shooting so exit the shooting range and then enter again with your own card
Pick up a new target and flip the switch to send it back
Now use the gun to get off the shots
Go back upstairs to Ruth rsquo s office and report that you have done your shooting
Exit and enter the lab
Give Wang rsquo s card back to him
Now you can use his terminal with the revolving graphic
Look at the monitor and click it to start the fingerprint scan
Press your ENTER key when prompted
At the upper left you see the front and back of the playing card that you scanned
Left click hold and drag one of the images into the upper rectangle
Click the green icon to analyze the image
Do the same for the other image
Left click one of the images in the upper rectangle to enlarge it in the center area
You can now see circles representing areas of interest
Do the same for the other image
You find that
The back of the card has areas of interest

The face of the card has areas of interest
Right click any circle to learn what you are supposed to do
Left clicking a circle activates it and left clicking it again deactivates it
Note that the magnifying glass icon at the upper right is now green which means that a search for a match will be performed for all active circles
Now things get tedious
Begin by making sure that there are no active circles on either card
Now activate one circle on either the back or face and click analyze
You decide that you need to select more areas so activate a second circle
When you click analyze you again find that you need to select more areas
For the moment skip over three active circles and try activating circles
Click analyze and find the process so painfully slow that you give up on it
Obviously you will get the same result if you activate all circles on the face of the card
Therefore you have learned one valuable piece of information You need to activate exactly circles
However there is a catch
You must activatea total of circleson the two images
Here are the possibilities Face Back The and combinations seem extreme so it makes sense to defer trying those
Number the circles from top to bottom of the face
For the back number the circles top to bottom
The two circles can be chosen in the following combinations Back Face Choose a single circle on the first image and then try all the combinations above for the second image
If that doesn rsquo t work change the single circle on the first image and then try all the combinations for the second image again
Keep going until you are successful or have exhausted all possibilities
If nothing worked then choose a single circle for the second image and try all the combinations above for the first image
I don rsquo t know whether the solution is randomized
I can tell you that my solution was circle on the back and circles and on the face
This solution causes matches to be displayed Read the reports of the five murders
The th report was depicted in the opening scene the th report is yours and deals with the car hit by a train
The common thread is the discovery of a playing card at the murder scene
Report your findings to Wang
Your hunch about a serial killer is confirmed
Exit the lab come down to Ruth rsquo s office and get permission to see the boss
Go into his office and talk to your by the book image conscious humorless boss
You succeed in getting the serial killer case but you can rsquo t win the argument about Nick
Your new partner is Dick Parry
All you can do about your computer is to visit IT and get a replacement
You can rsquo t leave the building for now because of a suspicious package found by the door
Go back out and talk with Ruth
She will find the Card Man files tomorrow
Go to the lab and talk with Wang
He wants you to find out whether he should evacuate because of the suspicious parcel
Go downstairs and out the front door to watch the sappers dealing with the parcel
Note that it is addressed to you
You automatically appear in the sappers rsquo office
Talk to the sapper to learn that the parcel contained a metal box with a combination lock
He gives you permission to play with the robot
Click the monitor and see the combination lock
You can play with the controls but you don rsquo t know the combination
Talk to the sapper again and then exit
Go back up to the lab and talk to Wang
Get theparcel wrappingwith strange doodles on it
If you haven rsquo t already enlarge the bloody message with gloves and place the message in an evidence bag
This frees up the gloves
Now enlarge the parcel wrapping and use the gloves on it to remove it from the bag
Go to Ruth rsquo s office and ask permission to use the photocopier
Use the gloves holding the parcel wrapping on the photocopier to obtain acopy of the doodles
If you can fold this paper the proper way you might be able to read the killer rsquo s message
Enlarge the copy of the doodles
You should be looking at the gray side of the paper with ldquo G rsquo clearly visible
Click the left arrow of the right vertical crease
Then click the right arrow of the left vertical crease
You see a Q and a red heart representing the queen of hearts
However there are two partial symbols above the Q that need to be completed
Click the reset button and then click the right arrow along the right edge of the paper or the left arrow along the left edge to flip the paper over to the light side
If necessary flip the paper over so that ldquo G rdquo is clearly visible Now make the following folds
Click the left arrow on the right vertical crease

Click the up arrow on the lower horizontal crease

Click the right arrow on the left vertical crease
You see Q and the heart symbol
Recall that the sapper is trying to open a box with a digit combination lock
Could Q and the heart symbol be a clue
Let rsquo s go ask him
Go downstairs to the sapper room and explain your dilemma to him
He gives information about the face value of the queen of hearts or
It appears the combination is or
Click the monitor to view the robot and the combination lock
The handle moves the robot arm right left up and down
The left button opens and closes the clamps on the arm
The right button resets the arm all the way to the left
The clamps must be open to move the arm right or left
Move the arm to the first dial
The clamps must grab the silver knob not the dial itself
Close the clamps and move the handle up or down to rotate the dial to
Open the clamps move the arm to the silver knob of the next dial
In this manner set the dials
doesn rsquo t work
Talk to the sapper again and get permission to take the slip of paper and the coin that are in the box
Go through the metal door at the back and approach the detonation chamber
Open the door and look in the box
Use the gloves to pick up thetoken
Enlarge an empty evidence bag and place the token in the bag
The token appears to be associated with the entertainment industry
Use the gloves to pick up the slip of paper
It looks like ahighway toll ticket
If you don rsquo t have any more evidence bags you will need to carry this around with you until you get more bags
Return to the sapper rsquo s room and exit
Go up to the lab and if necessary get an evidence bag from the table left of Wang
Enlarge it and place the highway toll ticket in the evidence bag
Now you need to scan this new evidence into the database
For both the token and the highway toll ticket use the gloves on the bag containing the item
Open the scanner cover deposit the item on the glass close the lid and press the blue button
I believed that both sides of each item needed to be scanned as was true for the playing card but only one side showed up in the database so maybe not
Go to the terminal with the revolving screen saver
Log in and follow the same procedure used for the playing card
For the highway toll ticket only one field can be selected at a time
Select a field run the analysis and then search for a match
Solution Exit second from the bottom
The token has only one field and the search returns the same result
See the second folder on the right for a map showing the location
Talk with Wang
Your new partner Dick Parry arrives
You brief Parry but you seem to have an attitude
Parry wants to hang back and analyze the evidence but you want to get moving to the amusement park
Your blood boils over and you announce that you are leaving with or without your partner
October Amusement Park New Jersey You Parry and a swat team arrive at the amusement park
Talk to the swat commander who declares the area clear
The still skeptical Parry lets you check around on your own
Head for the alley by the clown face entrance
You have a swat team member with you
Use the eyeball cursor to look around
Note that the park is being demolished
Go to the photo shack on the left and take thecrankwith a square hole in the end
Go farther down on the left to the shooting gallery Take themetal railingnext to the trash container
Go to the shuttered entrance and then to the roller shutter crank at the right of the door
Insert the crank handle but when you try to turn it you find the mechanism blocked
Maybe you need a key
Look at the mechanism high above the crank but you can rsquo t reach it
Use the metal railing on the shooting gallery wall right of the crank
Click the railing to stand it upright
Now look at the mechanism that might be seized up
You probably need a lubricant
Leave the shooting gallery and go to the chamber of horrors front that is right of the crane
Take thespadeat the far right
Check the storeroom on the left to see that it is closed
Go to the ghost train control room on the right click the door knob and enter
Take thetwo keysleft of the window
In the large view they say ldquo key berta rdquo Take theproplying along the bottom of the window
The keys don rsquo t work in the console
Look at the rest of the console and leave
Go inside to the ghost train
Take therailing barfrom the gate
Look at the backdrop scenery then entrance and exit doors and the train cars
Zoom in on the front car and look at the car axle
Zoom in on the car underbody and look at the rail and the drive wheels
Obviously there are things that need to be done here
Leave Evil House and come down to the guardhouse on the right
Take thewooden blockin front of the door
Enter the door into a messy compartment
Look at the key cabinet on the right wall
Your keys don rsquo t work on the padlock
Back away and look at the fridge and the padlock with the digit combination
Look at the desk and open the top drawer
Take thebulb thekey thetokens and the circularcanof air gun shot
Look at the key in the large view to see that it has no identification
Look at the tokens in the large view to see that they are the same as the one that was in the parcel to you
Exit the guard house
Look through the binoculars that are closer to the door
They are aimed at the shooting gallery
Is the word ldquo shoot rdquo a message
Look through the other binoculars but you need a token
Naturally the ones you have don rsquo t work
Go off to the right down the side alley
Pick up theoil canon the ground behind Dick Parry
Talk to him and then go forward to the barrels
Look at the barrels and the concrete slab You have now toured the area and you have collected a number items
It is time to revisit these places and try to get things done that you could not earlier
Because you now have an oil can a good place to start is at the shooting gallery
Come back down the side alley and go to the shooting gallery on the left
Try the key with the wooden tag in the mechanism lock and turn it
Zoom in on the roller shutter mechanism and use the can of oil on it
You offer a lame excuse for not doing that
Head back to the chamber of horrors and try the silver keys on the door
Click the handle and enter
It is too dark to enter but there is a light socket inside the door
Zoom in on it put your bulb in the socket and pull the chain
Standing just outside the door pick up thehammerfrom the floor
Go to the workbench and take thetrain car wheel Take thestringfrom the hook on the back wall and take theoil canfrom the back left of the bench
Exit the storeroom and return to the shooting gallery
Use the large can of oil to fill the oil can
Then zoom in on the mechanism again and use the oil can to lubricate it
Back away and turn the crank to open the shutter door
Enter the shooting area to see an air gun a button to start the targets and a slot for tokens
Take theplastic tilelying just above the button
Enlarge and see that it is all bent and warped
Place a token in the slot and use your air gun pellets to load the gun
Press the button to display some stationary bird targets
Click when your bulls eye cursor is on target
After you have shot all the bird targets moving rabbits appear
It is easiest to keep the cursor in one place and let the rabbits come to it
When you have hit all the rabbits you get awitch doll
Enlarge the doll and rotate it to see a key tag attached to the back
Take thekey tagand rotate it to see an arrow on one side and an omega symbol and on the other side
This key tag looks like those in the key cabinet in the guardhouse so exit and return to the guardhouse
Look at the key cabinet and zoom in on the upper right hinge
Pull thenailthat was used as a pin
Then use the door frame to remove it
The keys are out of order so you need to rearrange them
You can pull all the keys off the board and then put them back up in the correct place
Don rsquo t forget to include the tag from the doll
When you are done with this task note that the key and the key point to the key
Maybe this is a clue for opening the lock on the fridge
Look at the fridge and zoom in on the padlock
Turn the dials to and the lock opens
Remove the padlock and open the door
Take thekeysfrom the top shelf
The keys have no identification but the only remaining place that needs a key is the control console at the chamber of horrors
Go there
Hold another heated conversation with Parry
He plans to leave and claims that your boss called you back too
Parry and the swat team depart
Enter the console room and insert the key
It rsquo s probably not a good idea to try to start the train because you saw earlier that one wheel is missing
Look at the nail at the left of the window and use the railing bar to remove thebent nail
Go back over to the workshop on the other side and enter
Use the prop as a substitute handle on the vise
Place the bent nail in the vise and turn the handle
Take the nowstraight nail
While you are at it place the bent plastic tile in the vise and straighten it too
While the tile is still in the vise use the nail on it to create a hole
Remove the tile and use the string on it to createplasticwith string
Go back outside and into the center area
Zoom in on the axle with the missing wheel and place your wheel there
Insert the larger nail into the hole and then hit the nail with your hammer to bend it
Now the wheel won rsquo t fall off Zoom in on the carriage underbody and place the tile under the wheel
Now the wheel can rsquo t be energized and the string going up into the car will allow you to pull the tile when you are ready
Go back into the console room and turn the key
Your objective is to turn on all lights but each button controls a different combination
By experimenting you find Button Controls Buttons From the table you easily see that buttons and will do the trick
Go out and zoom in on the front car
Pull the string and off you go
You get aqueen of heartscard and you make a futile call to Parry
Head back to your starting point and encounter a man on a motorcycle
Talk to him and learn that he is Archie Benson who does security for the demolition crew
You bribe him into giving youbinocular tokensby giving him the combination to the fridge lock
Finish your conversation and go to the binoculars you couldn rsquo t operate before
Insert a token in the slot pull the handle and look through the lenses
You see a fuzzy image of the queen of hearts but the barrels are blocking your view
Go down the side alley and look at the barrels
Place the wood block on the concrete slab and use the shovel on the barrels
Down they all come
Return to the binoculars and take another look
Now you see some kind of large industrial building
Go into the guard house and talk with Archie about the power plant
You drive there
October Power Plant New Jersey Go to the hippie minibus and take thepipesticking out the front window
Look around and then go to the front door
Enter and see a mammoth gear being lowered and many red laser beams
Look at the vertical generator and take thefire extinguisher
Go to the back of the facility and look at a second generator
Go into the workshop on the right
Look at the work bench and open the left drawer
Take thewrench theflat file and thescrewdriver
Open the right drawer and take thetriangle file theround file and thekey
Go back toward the first generator and climb the stairs to Level
Go right along the walkway and approach the ladder going to the top of the generator
Climb the ladder and see a tied up woman on top the other generator
She might or might not be alive but the descending gear will do her in
You call to her to little avail and then call Parry for help
Look at the turbine top cover and take thewire cutters Use your wrench to remove the three bolts
Look at the hole at the top of the cover place the pipe in it and click the pipe to turn the cover
Go back down the ladder and head left along the walkway
Try the green door to Level but it is blocked from the other side
Go through the window out to a ledge
Look at the horizontal pipe
As you make your way over there the window closes so you can rsquo t leave this way
Use the pipe and go to the grated platform
Go up the ladder to the next ledge
Go to the window on the right and find yourself back in the building at Level Go right and look at the laser device nearest to you
No matter which way you turn the knob the bomb goes off
Don rsquo t worry about trying it because the game is automatically saved
Come forward to the platform and pick up thediagram
Enlarge and rotate it
Try the ladder that leads up to Level and see that the laser beam is blocking your way
Check your environment and see that the laser device nearest you is sending beams right and up
There is also an inactive laser receiver directly across from you on the other side
If you could redirect the upward beam across the way you would have access to Level
Look at the laser device and see that the upper diagram shows the current configuration straight lines right and up and the arrow shows the change that you want
Click the knob to the upper diagram
Now climb the ladder to Level
Go back along the walkway and head out on the gantry
Warning You are about to enter a timed sequence and it rsquo s very short
Your game is automatically saved but you will need to do a lot of experimenting to get past this
If you prefer a solution read on



Move to the crane on the gantry and see the bomb device
Use the fire extinguisher on the sensor at the top of the cover
This buys you a bit of time
Enlarge the screwdriver and use all three of your files on the end
Freeze the sensor with the fire extinguisher again and repeat as needed although there is a limited number of times that you can do that
Use the modified screwdriver to remove the screws
Then use the screwdriver on the right edge of the cover to lift it open
Use the wire cutters to cut the blue wire above the green blinking light not the wire coming out of the light
This shuts down the lasers but you still need to deactivate the clock
Use your key on the four fasteners at the corners and lift the inner cover
Use the screwdriver on the clock mechanism to bring it to a halt
Whew
Watch the cut scene of your trying to help the victim and your chase after the killer
October Local FBI Office Bronx New York You are in the monitoring room with your boss who is not happy with you
Archie Benson the security guy from the amusement park is being questioned by Parry
You insist on talking to him so enter the interrogation room and hold a useless conversation with Benson
Exit and talk with Parry
He wants the victims rsquo files that Ruth was supposed to have for you today
Go upstairs enter your office and pick up the files
Enlarge each of the photos for a summary of the victims
Go back to the interrogation room downstairs and show the photos to Benson
He finally admits that he recognizes Jane Harrington
Talk to Parry outside and then head upstairs
You meet Ruth who givesBenson rsquo s fileto you
You automatically go to see your boss
Benson is being released
His father is a big shot and Benson has an alibi
You review Benson rsquo s first trial for murder and the fact that he was in possession of the deck of cards the victim used for fortune telling
He was acquitted but all the current victims were jury members
You are unsure about the motive but there are many possibilities and many perpetrators Go to the lab and talk with Wang
Parry interrupts to tell you that the alleged murderer has called for you and will call back soon
You all gather in the monitoring room where Wang tries to trace the call
The murderer calls himself Paul
He describes how he baited his last two victims but he hangs up abruptly when you ask about the king of hearts
Wang will try to analyze the voice
Your boss informs you that another parcel arrived for you
When you check with the sapper you learn that it self detonated
He does give thewrapping paperto you though
Go up to the lab and talk to Wang about the voice analysis and the wrapping paper
After he leaves you can take a pair ofgloves Go to the scanner and follow the usual procedure
Use the gloves on the evidence bag with the wrapping paper and scan it Go to the database monitor and log in
Drag the wrapping paper image to the upper rectangle and analyze it
Click the image into the large pane and do a search on the one active area
You get a map of the locations in Louisiana
Send the map to the printer
Go to the printer and take themapshowing the office locations of the Louisiana Navigation Company
Look at the eleocharis rufilata folder to see the Louisiana parishes where it is found
Now to examine the seeds
Go to the work table where the gloves are and take thetweezers
Back away and go to the microscope
Take aglass slidefrom the blue box
Enlarge the bag of seeds use the tweezers to get them and use the tweezers with seeds on the glass slide
Click the stage to slide it out place the slide on it and click it back in again
Turn on the switch at the bottom and look through the eye pieces
Bring the red dot on the manual focus knob down to about to get a clear focus
Now you need to assemble the five pieces
Left click to grab a piece with the pincers and move it somewhere
Right click to rotate the piece
Double left click to flip the piece over
The large light piece should be at the top with the tendrils hanging down
The three dark pieces fit together easily
Place the tendrils piece atop the assembled dark pieces
The result looks somewhat like a cat facing right with a funny hat
Finally place the small light triangular piece at the bottom and pointing down
Press the red button to send the image to the database
Log in at the database manager click the seed image into the upper pane and analyze
Now you need to match your image with those to the right
You get a match with the rightmost image of the top row
Click the search button and learn that the seed is eleocharis rufilata
A map of where the seed is found is displayed
Press the print button then go to the printer at the far left to pick up themapthat shows the locations where eleocharis rufilata can be found
Go to your office and tell Dick Parry about your analyses of the wrapping paper and the seed
At least you have narrowed the search to Jefferson and Terrebonne Parishes but Parry isn rsquo t satisfied yet
He suggests that you perform the voice analysis Head downstairs to the monitoring room look at the one way mirror and then at the monitor at the left
Press ldquo Analyze rdquo and them select the st range
Press ldquo Filter rdquo to remove interference from some of the recording
Press ldquo Analyze rdquo again select the nd range and press ldquo Filter rdquo to remove more interference
Press rdquo Analyze rdquo select the rd range and press ldquo Filter rdquo Now you can press the play button and you hear a radio station from Lafayette
Now you have narrowed the three parishes down to Lafayette
Go up to your office and discuss your findings with Parry
He says the radio range is miles so draw a circle with a mile radius around Lafayette
Look at your desk and take themarkerleft of the keyboard
Look at the big wall map and use the switch on the left side to turn on the back light
Zoom in on the map and place both of your Louisiana maps on it
Use the marker to draw a circle
The location is the town of Detalion in Terrebonne Parish
Got you Card Man Talk again with Parry who seems to be softening a bit
You agree to travel together to Detalion
October Detalion Louisiana You begin at the sheriff rsquo s office
Talk with him and then go for a walk around town
Have a look around at the scenery and talk with Parry
Come forward down the street
You are now at the water front
Look at the house where the company used to be
Come down to the pier
Talk to the woman in the blue dress She recently took a stranger to the huntin rsquo cabin
Look at the air boat but the woman gets fussy if you try to use it
Leave the pier and approach the bar on the left
The bar is closed
Talk with the strange man on the bench
The sheriff took his mojo Go back to the pier and talk with the woman in blue
She is Momma Morton mentioned by the old man Aaron
The stranger who went to the steamer was not a lawyer
Headback to the sheriff rsquo s office and talk to him
You try to get him to take you to the steamer or to the cabin
You learn about Aaron whose sister sings in the bar
The boat isn rsquo t available and the sheriff doesn rsquo t want to take you to the steamer by car until Parry returns
When he walks away look at his desk
Pick up thescissors theadhesive tape and the oldpostcard
Enlarge the postcard to see what it is
Look at the cabinet with the trophy on top
Is that Aaron rsquo s bag behind the glass
There is a nail sticking out on the right edge of the glass pane
Take themapof Louisiana from the back wall
Enlarge to see that the route to the cabin is marked in red
Leave the office come down the street to the pier and talk with Momma Morton
You can rsquo t convince her to take you to the steamer or to rent the boat
Leave Momma and get a phone call from Parry
He needs to backtrack to retrieve a file he left during the trip here
Go to the bar and talk with Aaron
He will get the boat for you if you get his mojo back from the sheriff
Go back to the cabinet in the sheriff rsquo s office
Remove the nail you saw earlier but the cabinet is locked
Use the scissors where the nail was to remove the glass pane
Take ametal coiland themojo bag
Look at both in the enlarged view
Back away and pick up the glass pane that is leaning against the bookcase
Now it is replaced
Come back down to the bar and talk with Aaron
He gives a packagedchickento you
He breaks down and his sister Momma Morton arrives to tend to him
She agrees to let you use the boat to bring back the stranger
She gives you ridiculously complicated instructions for going to the cabin
You make no notes
Go to the boat and climb aboard
Look in the tool box and take thefunnelandbrake fluid
Look in the engine compartment beneath the seat and see that the tube is leaky
Click the tube to disconnect it
Use your scissors on the adhesive tape to get a strip of tape
Use the strip of tape on the tube and then click the tube to connect it
Click the rudder lever and find that the rudders aren rsquo t working
Look in the engine compartment under the seat again and disconnect the tube
Try the funnel in the end of the tube but it rsquo s too big
Click the old postcard to roll it into a funnel
Use the postcard funnel on the end of the tube and pour the brake oil into it
Reconnect the tube
Click the rudder lever to see that the rudders are working now
Off you go
I really thought we were going to have to navigate this trip but the game gods were merciful
You arrive at the cabin with almost no fuel left
Look at the raised drawbridge on the right and the steamer in the distance
Go up to the porch and you peek through the door
You capture the man sitting inside and cuff him to a post
Talk to him
He says he is Arthur Blake an author
He is here to meet someone named Turner to buy the cabin and the property including the steamer
After your talk with Arthur try to enter the cabin but it is too dark
Go around the left side of the porch
Take thedeck chairand theboat hook
The bottle contains drinking water but you won rsquo t pick it up
Look at the battery and see that one terminal is not connected
Look at the right side of the porch but it is too dark
Come down to the boat and call Parry
He and the sheriff will come pick you up but meanwhile he will check on Arthur Blake
You automatically call Ruth to ask her to check the agents rsquo firm in New Orleans and Turner
Head back to the cabin and get two immediate replies
There are no such agents in New Orleans but Parry confirm rsquo s Arthur rsquo s identity
Parry notes the similarity of victims being led into a trap by the Card Man
He and the sheriff will be there soon
Talk to Arthur and remove his handcuffs
He tells of his meeting with Turner at an office that might not actually be there
You discuss his plans for living here and repairing the steamer
Arthur has ambitious dreams
He has nothing in writing from Turner or his picture
Go down to the pier and over beside the boat
Look at the middle post and take the piece ofwirewrapped around the post
Go back to the porch and around the left to the battery
Click the wire in inventory to straighten it out and then place it on the battery terminal
Use your scissors to cut another piece of adhesive tape and use the strip to cover the connection of the two wires
Enter the cabin and look around
Go into the kitchen open the left door of the cabinet and take thecan of tea
Pick up the twomugson the cabinet
Take the out of datecalendarfrom the side of the fridge
Take thekerosene lampfrom the desk
Look at the stove beside Arthur and take thekettle
Ask Arthur about the camera
Leave the cabin and get a call from Parry
He and the sheriff are stuck in the mud and there is no telling when they can get here
You will need to spend the night here
Parry reports that the cabin and the steamer actually belong to Aaron
It appears that Turner is pulling a fraud because you know that Aaron doesn rsquo t want to sell the property
Go to the now lighted right side of the porch
Take thebucketand theaxe
Use the axe on the broken crate and take thekindling wood Take thebasinand thecan
Go back to the boat and look at that post where you found the wire
Dip the bucket into the water to fill it
You might be able to distill some fuel for the lamp
Return to the cabin and open the stove door
Place the kindling wood and the old calendar inside
Ask Arthur for alighterand use it to light the fire
It seems as though you would close the stove door but apparently not
Go out to the right side of the porch and use the kettle on the bottle of water
Go back in and place the kettle on the stove
Place both mugs on the stove also
Use the can of tea on each mug to place tea bags into them
Chat with the romantic Arthur and hear how he fictionalizes reality
He suggests tea and a cell phone rings
Step outside to discover that it wasn rsquo t your cell
Go back inside where Arthur says the tea is ready
Take a mug from the stove and

Oh no
When you awaken you find that Arthur has vanished
Go outside to the end of the pier by the drawbridge
It is lower than it was before
You find Arthur rsquo s cell phone with a text message from Turner
Apparently Arthur has gone to meet him at the steamer
You explain the situation to Parry who says he will form a special unit
Use the boat hook to pull the drawbridge down and proceed across
Yikes
Recall what Aaron said about the alligator
Click the package of chicken to unwrap it and toss the chicken to the alligator
You come to some poles sticking out of the water but you need some light before attempting to cross them
Return to the cabin Now you need to distill the contents of the bucket to make some fuel for the kerosene lamp
To do this you need to make a crude distillery
Go to the stove and remove the cup
Left click the deck chair to obtain a piece of canvas
Use the canvas on the funnel and enlarge to see the result
Use the scissors on the canvass to trim it up a bit
Place the funnel and canvas into the top of the kettle
Now use the bucket on the funnel to pour liquid into the kettle
Place the cup back on the stove
Use the metal coil on the spout of the kettle to connect the coil to the mug
Finally use the scissors to cut off some adhesive tape and place the strip on the spout of the kettle
Remove the funnel and watch the petroleum drip into the cup
Take the cup and pour the contents into the lamp
Use the lighter to light the lamp
Go back out across the drawbridge to the end of the pier where the poles are
Place the basin in the water in front of you
Then place the can on the basin and place the lamp on the can
Watch the light scoot away and illuminate the area for you
Now you need to hop across the poles
However some of the poles are not safe and if you go to the wrong ones you become alligator food
Moreover some of the poles depress and rise so timing is an issue
You can rsquo t dither
Therefore SAVE YOUR GAME
There is no auto save here
I don rsquo t know how to get across these poles except by trial and error taking note of poles to be avoided in your next try
Start with the pole on the left
Then Forward times Right Forward times Left Forward times to the platform Pick up thestickfrom the platform and use it to retrieve the lamp
Continue forward to another larger set of posts
Once again there is no auto save here and the same dangers await you
SAVE YOUR GAME
Place the lamp in the water in front of you
Here is a route you can take Forward once Use the stick on the board to make a walk across Come down diagonally to the post left of the walk across Forward Right Forward Right times Forward Left times Forward times Left Forward Remove the lamp then place it on the post to Nicole rsquo s left Remove the can and the basin
Put the basin then the can on the post in front of you
Forward times
Continue right and see the steamer with a turning paddle wheel
Go forward across the gangplank to the steamer
Go up the stairs on the left to the middle deck
Go up the stairs in the upper right corner to the upper deck
Take the stairs up to the top deck
Go right and see that poor Arthur has been tied to the paddle wheel
Take theclapperfrom the broken bell
Come back down toward the bridge
Go to the bridge and find no way to use the door
Use the clapper to break the pane of glass
Reach inside and use the handle to open the doors
Enter the bridge house
Take thehatthat is hanging from the engine room annunciator on the left and get theking of heartsin addition Look at both in the large view
Use the handle on the annunciator to stop the paddle wheel
Leave the bridge house and return to the paddle wheel
In the next scene Dick Parry and some officers have finally shown up and they have caught someone
Hey isn rsquo t that the guy who was in the bar next to the theater
October Local FBI Office Bronx New York You are in the interrogation room with the suspect
Get ready for a very long conversation
The suspect is Jacob Jack Rowling and he is a journalist for the NY News
You saw him at the bar the photo in the newspaper places him at the power plant and now he was caught at the steamer
He got an anonymous email about going to the bar and then he received an anonymous phone call about the power plant
When you leave to get a soft drink for Rowling you get a call from Wang
He has managed to get a fingerprint from the device that controlled the auto at the rail crossing
You can find it in the database
Talk to Parry about securing Rowling rsquo s evidence
Parry is targeting Rowling as the murderer but you are skeptical
Parry suggests getting his fingerprints from the soft drink can
He still needs to talk to Rowling about Louisiana
Get acola canfrom the drinks machine and enter the interrogation room
Talk to Rowling and take back the cola can without gloves
when he is finished with it
Leave the room and go upstairs to the lab
Talk to Wang about lifting the fingerprints from the can
You get a call from Ruth about your father calling
Go out of the lab and call your father
Troublesome news about your mother
Go back in and talk to Wang
The fingerprints are now in the database
Log in at the monitor
Drag the journalist rsquo s print into the pane and do a search
The print is not found so Rowling apparently doesn rsquo t have a criminal record
Now do the same for the partial print from the car wreck
This time you are denied access
Now place both prints in the pane
Before you start a comparison be aware that the partial print has orientations
In its present orientation the print looks like a mouse with its tail to the right
If you want to change the orientation just left click the print take it away somewhat and then right click to rotate it
Look at the partial print in its original orientation very carefully
One distinguishing feature is a dark ldquo U rdquo tilted a little to the right
There are also white lines on either side of the ldquo U rdquo and they continue up left where they cross
If you look carefully at the print on the right you don rsquo t see a configuration like that
If you want to check a match anyway click the left print carry it over the right print try to line it up with something promising and click
No matter where you put it no matter which orientation you use you never get a match
Apparently Rowling rsquo s print is not on the crime scene device
He is looking more and more exonerated
Back out and tell Wang what you have learned
He suggests that you check the military database and that you talk to the boss about access
Go to the boss rsquo office and talk to Ruth
Then talk to the boss who arranges access to the database
Return to the lab and the database
Once again drag the car device print into the pane and perform a search
Ten possible matches are found and the print images are displayed at the right
Click each in turn and look for that ldquo U rdquo characteristic
You will find it in the first print in the second row and the orientation is even the same
Pick up the left print carry it over to the right print carefully line up the ldquo U rdquo and click
You get a match for Paul Reed
Report your result to Wang and leave the lab
The boss is out there and you fill him in
Paul Reed is in Maine where he is working on a secret project named ldquo Queen of Hearts rdquo It turns out that Arthur Blake the writer was on that same jury
Your hypothesis is holding up
The boss thinks the other potential jury victims are protected but he isn rsquo t sure about the judge Wolsey
You go to see Ruth who reports that Judge Wolsey in Maine has disappeared
Go to your office and talk with Parry
When you tell him about Paul Reed Parry reminds you that the caller told you to call him Paul
You talk Parry into driving to Maine with you
October Norwitch Maine Paul Reed rsquo s House You find Paul Reed rsquo s house but there is no sign of him
It appears he has been gone quite a while
You wonder whether the barn is used for Reed rsquo s devices and maybe explosives
Parry doesn rsquo t want to search the barn without a warrant
He outlines his theory of the relationship between the killer and you
Parry receives a phone call something about a lens
He won rsquo t say more
He goes into town to get a warrant
Take the bluemattressfrom behind the mailbox
Go toward the barn door and look at the stove
Take thepump
Remove the front stove door and take the bag ofsaltand thesoap
Close the door and back away
Check the barn door and see that it is padlocked
Go to the right behind the barn
You see an upstairs window that is open
Maybe that is your entry
Look at the conveyor belt and pick up theboardon the left
Use the salt to melt the snow around the wheel
Place the mattress on the hard ground beneath the conveyor
Then place the board on top of the mattress
Use the air pump on the mattress nozzle at the right end
Now the wheel is lifted out of the hole but the conveyor isn rsquo t moving forward
Apply the soap to the board and then click the bottom structure to move the conveyor to the window
Take a peek inside the window and look around at all the incriminating evidence
Drop down into the workshop
Look at the elevator and then at the code panel
You see a row of squares with patterns
Your task is to set the pattern on the right so that the four patterns are in a logical sequence
The knob on the right can be dragged to change the display in the right window
When you think the right window is correct press the button
If you are correct a green light goes on
I can rsquo t give the solutions for the three sets of patterns because it is a near certainty that they are randomized
Fortunately none of the puzzles is very difficult
When you get three green lights the elevator door opens
Go up into another workshop and look around at all the diagrams
Go back down and you are confronted by an elderly couple a man in a wheelchair and a woman holding a rifle
In the course of the dialog the woman calls the man Paul
You explain why you are here and tell them about Paul rsquo s fingerprint on the device
You relate how the device caused the death of Edward Carter
Paul is becoming more cooperative than his sister Fan
He tells of designing the circuitry according to the specs of an unknown man who paid him but whom he has never seen
He received a number of such orders and the pay always came from a different city
Paul starts to have some guilt about his creations and their uses for murder
Fan is bitter and angry and suggests that Paul rsquo s confinement was due to an accident
The accident was at a military lab and it was caused by a man named Peter Douglas
Paul ended up in a wheelchair and Peter ended up in jail
Paul can rsquo t imagine who placed the orders but he will look through his documents
Paul and Fan passed Parry on their way home and Parry reminded Fan of a man named Derek Finney
He was a local who was murdered in a church tower in a manner similar to your cases
The church pastor is still there
Come down to your car and automatically call Parry to brief him
You then drive to the church
The Church and Cemetery Enter the gate and talk with the pastor
Question him about the murder of the pastor rsquo s son in law Derek Finney
On the day of Finney rsquo s death he was meeting another woman in the church tower
The pastor relates the abusive relationship of Finney and the pastor rsquo s daughter Annie
The pastor believes that Finney changed for the worse when he became a jury member for the Benson trial
There is a suspicion that Benson rsquo s rich and powerful father bribed the jury
Finney is buried here in the churchyard
Finney had a nail in his hand at the site of his murder scene
Scratched floorboards were replaced
Walk into the church and get a call from Paul the Card Man
He taunts you and you are sure he is preparing for another crime
Look around the foyer
Take thepaint brushfrom the seat of the prie dieu on the right
The brown door on the left is locked
Go back out and ask the pastor for thekey
Go back inside use the key on the door and enter
It rsquo s too dark to see but recall that the pastor was holding a flashlight
Go back outside and borrow theflashlight
Go back to the church tower
Look in the dark corner left of the cabinet and see an electric plug
Click the plug to make a connection and produce light
Go back outside and return the flashlight
Enter the tower again
Take theleverfrom the post across from the stairs Look in the cabinet at the clock mechanism
Look at the loose floorboard by your right foot
Use the lever to remove the two nails
Use the lever again to remove the floorboard
The old floor is dusty so use the brush on it
Letters appear that look like ldquo D rdquo and ldquo P rdquo Dick Parry
Return to the pastor
He explains how Finney was killed but it is believed that he was still alive when the police officer found him
The officer might have let Finney die
It was the same police officer who was trying to help Annie Finney rsquo s abused wife
The police officer was Dick Parry
Go left to the church cemetery
Look around the graves
Finney rsquo s is the one near the path
Look at the gravestone and see a deuce of hearts engraved on it
Go back and talk to the pastor
He says that the card was engraved on the gravestone a year after the funeral
Head for the car and get a call from Ruth
She sent a fax for you to the courthouse
Another parcel arrived from the Card Man
It was detonated and the debris was glass the kind used in Fresnel lenses in lighthouses
Recall Parry mentioning a lens in his furtive phone conversation
You automatically go to the court house
Court House Come down screen and remove thespadefrom the trash container
Enlarge to see that it isn rsquo t really a spade just a handle
The court house is dark but try the front door anyway
Looking through the door you see light at the end of the corridor
Go around to the back of the courthouse and see a window with light
Try the middle window which is slightly open but it is too high to reach
Look at the advertising board and see that it is chained to the light post
Look at the light post and use the spade handle to break the chain
Pick up the advertising board and place it against the wall beneath the middle window
Enter through the window and see indications that a burglar has broken in
Enter the door into the archives
Look at the stuff on the shelves and then continue right to the rear of the room
Good grief it rsquo s Parry
He is rummaging through documents in pursuit of a lead on Peter Douglas the colleague of Paul Reed
Peter Douglas has a connection to Archie Benson because they were in jail together
The murders began to happen a year after Douglas was released
You confront Parry with his involvement going back to the Finney murder in the church
Parry claims to have broken in because of his concern about the disappearance of Judge Wolsey but you don rsquo t believe him
You accuse Parry of being involved in a conspiracy and you make a futile attempt to arrest and cuff him
You end up in a car chase that results in Parry rsquo s death
His last words are that he was being blackmailed and tells you to go to the lighthouse
Note Is anyone else disappointed by all this
I kind of liked Dick Parry
Lighthouse Hut The lighthouse looks inaccessible from here
Take a look around at the environment and note in particular the cable car
Go to the hut on the cliff
Look at the fort again and then enter the hut
Pick up themetal coverfrom the floor on the left
Look at the jacket on the left and take thejacket thebeltthat is behind it and thehookfrom which the jacket was hanging
Enlarge the jacket and take thecigarettesand thematchesfrom the two pockets
Pick up theflywheeland thereelfrom the floor
Take theboardfrom the broken bench on the right
Look in the crack in the floor and see a wrench that you can rsquo t reach
Look at the engine and pick up thewing nutat the lower left
Place the flywheel on the axle and screw the wing nut on the end of the axle
Check the fuel tank and see that you need that wrench in the crack
Check the clutch to see that the lever is missing
Check the cylinder head and take theshank
Enlarge the shank and look at the threaded end
You recall that this item was used to heat the cylinder head
Enlarge the pack of cigarettes and take a cigarette
Light it with the matches
Now enlarge the shank again and insert the burning cigarette in the end
Insert the shank back into the hole
Attach the hook to the board and use the result to get thewrenchfrom the crack in the floor
Look again at the fuel tank on the engine and use the wrench to remove thecap
Attach the cap to the metal cover
At this point you are still missing the clutch lever and you have no fuel
Leave the hut go to the cable way behind the hut and look around
Go to the container in the background
Take theleverthat is along the support leg
Place the metal container underneath the valve and turn the valve
Nothing happens so remove the stone from under the container leg
The last of the fuel in the container begins to drip
Turn the valve and then pick up the metal container
Return to the hut and use the metal container on the fuel tank
Enlarge the metal cover retrieve the cap and place the cap on the fuel tank
Look at the clutch and insert the lever
You need to find a way to engage the clutch because you are the only one here
Click the reel to get some fishing line and use it on the lever
Now use the belt on the flywheel axle
Click to start the engine
Go back around the hut and enter the cable car for a hair raising ride to the lighthouse
The Lighthouse Go up to the platform
The question now is how do you get higher
It is especially useful to look at everything here
Zoom in on the metal ladder and click the hook at the end of the steel rope to connect it to the ladder
Jump to the two beams and then to the platform
Continue forward on the platform and take the stairs up to the next level
Try the door but there is no way
Take the longoarfrom the boat
Next to the steel rope that you connected to the ladder is another steel rope that drapes off to the right
You can rsquo t reach it so use the oar to release the rope down to the other platform
Go back down and hop across the lower platform
Look at the mine and use the steel rope to attach it to the mine
Ooops


Back away and pick up thebeamthat just fell
Look at the mine again and use the beam on it as a lever
Push on the lever to roll the mine down
The effect is to raise the ladder up to the next platform
Go back up and climb the ladder to the roof
Go up the small brown ladder to the hatch and find no way to open the hatch doors without a crane
Go back down and then left to the lighthouse door
It too is locked
It appears that the crane is your only hope
Go to the crane and look at the control panel in front of you
Take thejoker cardsticking up from the panel
Look at all the buttons and levers to learn their functions
Your task is to move the crane over to the hatch
After pressing the green button here is a sequence that works
Move the left vertical knob up to raise the crane arm

Move the top horizontal button twice in either direction to rotate the crane

Move the bottom horizontal knob left to extend the arm

Move the right vertical knob down twice to lower the hook
Go up to the hatch and click the crane hook to attach it to the hatch door
Return to the crane control panel and press the green button to turn it on
Move the right vertical knob up twice to raise the hatch door
Go back up to the hatch and jump down into the storage area
You are confronted by Archie Benson who clears up much of the mystery
Peter Douglas is upstairs
You shoot Benson
Look between the supports and take thebucketand thesmall wrench
Pick up thebroomleaning on the left wall and thebig wrenchin front of the broom
Look at the duct and use a wrench on the handle to open it
Look at the toolbox right of the door
Open it and take thebroken bladeand themedium wrench Look at the junction box on the wall right of the door
Use the blade to remove the screws and get thecover
Enlarge the cover and rotate it to see wiring instructions
Look again at the junction box
To attach a wire click it and then click the terminal to which you want to attach it
From the diagram blue on the left brown in the middle black on the right
Back away and flick the switch
The water is pumped out of the duct
Look at the duct and jump down into it
The fan blades are blocking your way
Note You might want to save here long enough to experiment with the wrenches
Once you get the hang of it and you can load and start at the beginning orientation
There are three sets of blades one behind the other
The goal is to line up the three sets of blades so that none has a blade hanging downward
Each wrench controls certain blades
You cannot use any wrench twice in a row
Number the blades through front to back
Wrench Controls Blades small medium large One plan is to work on the front blades first
Once it is set work on the middle blades
Finally the back blades
When you have to change wrenches always use a larger wrench than the one you are using to set a certain set of blades
That way you won rsquo t ruin your previous work
When you have all the blades aligned upward crawl through the duct to a small platform
Most of the platform is uneven but there is a stable spot at the left
The grating above you is too high to reach
Click the bucket to remove its handle
Click the handle to bend it into a loop
Click the brush to remove its handle
Attach the loop to the handle
Place the bucket on the stable spot of the platform and click the grating above you
You are able to see a door with a handle
Place the broom handle with the loop on the handle
Click the broom handle to move the door handle
Click the broom handle one last time to remove it
Pick up the bucket and crawl back through the culvert to the storeroom
Back away and go to the storeroom door that is how unlocked
Go through the door and up the spiral stairs
Watch the final confrontation

Atlantis The Lost TalesSolution by Willem van der Velden July All screen shots in this solution are from Atlantis Cryo Interactive Entertainment http www cryo interactive fr CRYOGAME HTM
They were simply captured using the quot print screen quot toolkit
This is at least the third adventure game using the Atlantis myth that has been produced during the last two years the other two are Timelapse and Ark of Time
This one has its own charm though it's the quot toothless version quot look at the characters
The D engine makes you a little dizzy in the beginning but you get used to it
There are some flaws in the game but not very irritating
However the auto saving option is a very bad choice
It doesn't save at the right spots and sometimes you have to replay long sequences
By mistake I bought the Dutch version so I had to do with the usual terrible voice acting
Therefore the names of the characters may differ from versions in other languages
I have to apologize for my language errors but I don't think they will cause serious misunderstandings
I use some abbreviations in the walkthru AS for automatic scenes and DB for the dialogue boxes
Any feedback is welcome

IntroWhat to say about Atlantis
The game really is exciting from the beginning till the end
There is absolutely no part where you will get bored
It all looks great and the music contributes to it all very well
I think we just had to wait to long for such a great adventure
It's just one of those few games you will never want to dispose of
Simply because you just want to play another time again
In short an absolute must for every adventurer
So my advise hurry to the shop and buy it
Ain't there nothing at all to complain
Well to be honest yes
I do have three minor complaints
In the first place it's a little bit annoying that you have to keep on changing
It gives you the real DJ feeling sometimes
In the second place the way of saving games isn't quiet logical
The images of the saved games are all the same in the different levels
So when you want to restore a saved game you just have to guess which is the right one
In the third place there is no way of lip synch
A game like this just deserves better Finally I think that the end of the game and the part about Atlantis is way to short
Searching a crystal which even a blind man can see from a distance and killing the octopus with it is all there is in Atlantis
So this part will be over in about five minutes
Beginning Look around
You are surrounded by a cold chilly landscape
Walk towards your vessel that's lying out there somewhere
Enter the vessel and go down the hatch
Turn around and pick up the triangular piece of stone from the wooden barrel
Turn to your left and enter the next room
Turn to your right and speak with the man who is sitting down on the floor
Ask him about everything you can
He will give you a crystal ball
No need to say that you have to take it
Turn to the left and pick up the next piece of stone which is lying beneath the desk
Turn to the right and walk to the device that looks like a planetarium
Standing in front of it first turn to the right and pick up the third piece of stone that is lying beneath the hammock
Now stand in front of the planetarium
Place the second triangular stone at the bottom of the ring of the planetarium
The first stone at the right spot Ireland Now you will be teleported to Ireland
Ask the old father about the poor monk Finbar
Leave through the door way at your left
Turn to the right and walk outside
Walk straight down the path
At the end of the path turn to the left and try to have some conversation with monk Finbar
It seems that things aren't going to well with him for the moment
Go back into the chapel
At the porch of the chapel turn to you left and take a look at the crying statue at the wall
Now walk to the old father
Ask him about monk Finbar first and the ask him about the crying statue at the wall in the porch of the chapel
After finishing your conversation take a look at the book at the right of the holy father
Take a pencil out of the container above the book
Zoom in at the open book and try to right something on the right page with your pencil
By doing this you will end up in the book
Talk to the standing man in blue Dian
Ask him about everything and everybody
Then walk towards the king who is sitting on his throne
Ask him about all you can
Walk back to Dian and stand in front of him
Then turn to the right and walk straight ahead and EXIT the book
Exit the book Go through the doorway and enter the room with the altar
Walk to the doorway out and stand still
At he right of the doorway you will see a bookcase
Pick up the piece of skull out of the case
Walk outside and go to the poor Finbar
At the splitting over there go to the left
Walk between the two poles into the hay field
Pick up the hay fork
Exit the hay field turn to the right and keep on walking straight ahead until you reach the bee hive
Take the second piece of skull out of the second bee hive of the right
Turn to the left and continue walking straight ahead until you reach the fox in his cave
Poke him with your hands or with your fork until he leaves his cave
Then keep on walking straight ahead again till you meet the flock of sheep
Between the big boulders you'll find the third piece of skull
Walk back to the chapel
This time don't go inside but walk towards the three cottages at the left of it
From the first cottage pick up the black cup
Walk to the well and pick up the fourth piece of skull what is lying at the ground near the chicken
The piece of skull behind the chicken
If it isn't there you didn't drive out the fox as I told you before
Enter the left part of the garden
Over there you will see a ladder standing against the wall
Climb it
Look down the hole in the roof
Examine the big cross below
On top of it you will see another piece of skull
Use your hay fork to shuffle it down the bog cross
Climb down and enter the chapel
Enter the room with the big cross
Pick up the fifth piece of skull from the floor
Go outside again and walk to monk Finbar
At the splitting go to the right this time
Head for the square cottage you see in the distance
Enter the cottage and walk in front of the broken skull
Fix the skull using the five pieces you found on your trip outside
Almost finished the job
Walk back to the entrance of the chapel
This time don't go inside but facing the frontdoor turn to the right and walk around the chapel
Turn to the left and you'll see a fish bone like drawing at the wall of the chapel and a circular drawing
Enter the chapel and fill your black cup with tears of the crying statue
Exit the chapel and walk to the old father who is sitting outside
Ask him about the remarkable drawings on the wall
He will give you a key
With that key open the box that is standing on the floor of the cottage to the right of the holy father
Pick up the knife and the piece of parchment
Speak to the holy father once again and ask him about the piece of parchment
Show him the parchment and click on the images of the trees
Walk back to the square cottage where you transformed the skull into Ailill
Give him some water out of your black cup
When he asks for it give him the knife
After that ask him about the white horse and about himself
Go back to the chapel and stand in front of the wall with the drawings
When you have a closer look you will see three sets of marks
An upper set a center set and a lower set
By clicking on the right or the left side with you knife you can change the position of the marks
By clicking on the center of a mark makes it disappear
Transform the drawing like this Click times on the left of the upper set
Then remove from bottom up the lowest marks by clicking on the center of them
Click time on the right of the center set so that all are pointing up to the left
Remove all the marks of the lower set by clicking from bottom up on the center of them
After that click with your knife on the circular drawing
Now the wall lowers and you can pick up the stick
It should look this way after finishing
Walk to the cottage of Ailill
Standing in front of it go to the right
Then turn to the left and walk to the pillar with the figure of the horse
Use your stick and hit the pillar to set the horse free
Now the horse takes off
The only thing you have to do now is catching the running horse
The easiest way to do this is to turn to the right and do one step forward
Then turn to the left and go past Aillil's cottage
Then go forward one more time and wait for the horse
When it approaches you just keep on standing still
You are blocking its way
When the horse has stopped in front of you simply pick it up Now just pick up the animal Go to the left and walk to the narrow beach
Walk to the part with the poles sticking out of the water
Place the horse into the water
When the real horse comes alive climb it
Arriving on the deserted island walk to the tree with the birdman sitting in it
Talk to him
The only thing he is doing right now is chirping
Ask him about himself
Try to learn the sounds of the different birds
Ask him about the white horse and after that about Aillil
The purpose is to chirp along with the birdman by clicking the right bird
I can't give you the right order because the tunes of the birdman as well as the tunes of the different birds are changing all the time
A few tips when you chirp the wrong song the birdman answers with an angry tune consisting of three sounds
When you chirp the correct song he answers with a little bit friendlier tune consisting of two sounds
When the birdman is chirping his song you better move your cursor to the side of your screen
Then after finishing his song you better touch one of the birds just shortly
So you will hear the corresponding tune of the bird just once
If you hold your cursor on the birds the tune will be played uninterrupted and believe me that will drive you nuts
Knowing all this first ask the birdman about himself
Keep on doing that until he lets you know by reacting with his two sounds tune that you have given the correct answer
After that do the same with the question about the white horse and Aillil
So what more can I say
Have fun keep on smiling good luck and God bless you As soon as you have chirped the right songs he will jump out of the tree
Question him about the glass tower
According to his answers it should be somewhere below surface
To help you on your search to the glass tower he gives you a divining rod
Walk to the open area between the two bent walls
Stick the divining rod into the ground at the right spot
Here it is
When you placed the stick at the right spot the ground starts shaking
After that a well appears
Enter the well and swim all the way down
A big electric eel blocks your way so with the glass tower in view you can't get deep enough
Swim all the way up to the surface and walk to the birdman
Question him about all you can
Walk back to your horse and climb it
Enter the chapel again and take place in front of the big open book
Pull your pen and draw something on the man in the red garb who is standing to the right of the right pillar
By doing so a drawing of a sword appears
After that draw something on the right pillar to enter the book
Look at the sword Walk to the standing man in the blue dress Dian and ask him about his daughter Airmid who is changed into a statue
Then walk to the king who is sitting on his throne
Talk to him and pick up the sword
Exit the book and walk once more to the cottage of Aillil
Talk to him and ask him about Airmid
Go back to the chapel
Walk to the holy father who is still sitting in the garden
Talk to him and question him about the sun
He will give you a mysterious cross
Enter the chapel and stand in front of the big tapestry
Place the cross at the right of the church tower in the sky
Turn to the right and meet the fresh awaked Aine
Question her about everything you can
After she tells you that all your wishes have come true walk to the open book once more
Again draw something on the right pillar
In the book walk to Airmid and see that she is no longer a statue
Question her about everything you can and exit the book again
Now draw something on the left dark brown statue
A salmon appears into her hands
Enter the book again and talk to Airmid again
She gives you a amulet which makes it possible to stay below surface longer
May be now you can defeat the electric eel
Exit the book and walk to your horse
Climb it for another ride to Birdsisland
Back on Birdsisland enter the well again
Swim all the way down and use the amulet to defeat the eel
When the eel has left swim down to the bottom of the well and pick up the crystal
Finishing off the eel Go back to the chapel and enter the big book for the last time
Walk to the standing man in blue and give him the crystal
Pull your sword and chip the crystal into smithereens
Pick up the silver hand and walk to the king on his throne

Click on one of these images to go to that part of my walkthroughOr click on the image at the bottom of this page to go to the next part After your Savior the Targui has left you decide to take a look around a little bit
You can go only one way
So go that way
Walk forwards and than go to the left
Go forwards two times
You are now facing a guard
You can try to speak to him but be careful it's a very unkind type with very loose hands You can go to the left
But that path leads to a dead end street up in the mountains
Turn to the right and you'll see a path leading up with a small bush
Go into that direction
Turn to the left and go forward one more time
Another guard is attacking you
Thank goodness you'll be saved once more by this unknown person
Walk towards the bent rock formation
The correct way While you are going through this rock formation you'll see some kind of cables on the ground coming from the right
Turn to the right and enter the cave
Walk towards the circular hell lightened membrane
It leads to another part of the cave but is still closed
Your goal is to open this membrane
Look to your right and you'll see all kind of technical equipment
You can't do anything with it so leave it alone
Standing in front of the membrane look down
On the ground you'll see a circle and above it five different signs
Take your disk from your inventory and place it at the center of the circle
Now take your stick and place it on the disk
You just made yourself a gyroscope
By placing this gyroscope in the correct on the signs you'll open the membrane
The gyroscope also called top Number the signs from the left to the right as number and
Place the gyroscope in this order on the signs
I have the idea that this combination can be different in some games
If the last one didn't open the membrane just try this one and
If neither one of these combinations does the trick you'll have to try out another one yourself
Every time you place the gyroscope on the correct sign it will spin across the circle leaving behind a star at the rim of the circle
After having done all five of them the membrane opens revealing the next part of the cave which seems to be some kind of temple
Enter the membrane
This time the room is filled with a big sarcophagus at the center
Before you do anything else in this room look to the pillar at your right
On the floor near the right corner of the pillar you'll find a very well hidden wooden bird
It's very hard to see
Pick it up
The very well hidden bird Walk towards the wall at the right side of the sarcophagus
You'll see a mural of two Egyptian guys with an image of a star and beneath that star you'll see curved line with markings to the left and to the right
From the top to the bottom you'll see one marking to the left two markings to the right one to the left and another one to the right
Remember or write down this code You are going to need it in a few seconds
The code to open the sarcophagus Walk towards the symbol on the wall at the left of the sarcophagus
You can push the left and the right side of the star
By pushing both sides in the correct order the sarcophagus opens
The code is the one you just saw on the mural on the other wall and is x left x right x left and x right
Look what's coming out of the sarcophagus
It's nothing less then a personal Psychopomp
It's your personal help and companion for the next part of the game
Although
helper
He won't be of very much of a help to you
The most important things is that he knows how to steer the air ship
You can ask him about anything you like
Walk to the stairs leading up
If you don't know where to find these stairs I suggest you better quit the game right now Of course you might think that you simply can climb up these stairs
Just try and you'll see that this isn't the case Take your wooden bird from your inventory and use it on the stairs
You'll be transported to a higher part of the pyramid
When you're standing outside walk to the air ship
Talk to the Psychopomp and ask him about everything you can
Hop on board of the air ship
The first place you're visiting is the island with the temple of the high priest
After you landed turn around and enter the temple
Walk to the priest who is waiting for you
He tells you that the Pharaoh is dying
But before he can do so he must be able to be reborn again
And to do that he needs a special kind of feather and the symbol of life
Your goal is to find this special feather plus the symbol of life of course and deliver it to the high priest
Walk back to your vessel and speak to the Psychopomp
Ask him about everything you can
Now choose your map from your inventory
On the image below you'll find the most efficient order in which you should pay a visit to the several locations
The map with the correct destinations First of all go to
Walk towards the altar
Open the small box
You'll find an Ankh cross the symbol of life
After that go to
Here you'll find another priest
She tells you that you have put together an old story
This sounds pretty easy but it isn't
Walk towards the wall at the right behind this priest
You'll see a wall existing of different tiles and beneath very tile you'll see a small strip with some ancient inscription
Your goal is to make a logical story by placing the strips into the correct sequence
After that you have to place each and every tile into the correct position corresponding with the sentence of the strip
So remember first you have to place the strips into the correct order and after that you'll have to do the tiles
If you are doing this in the reverse order it won't work
When you push on the strips you'll hear the sentence corresponding with that strip
The correct order of the strips with the sentences is Strip Osiris son of the Earth and Sky is Pharaoh and Isis his sister is Pharaoh's wife she brings knowledge to Egypt
Strip Seth twin to Osiris is jealous of his brother and plans his murder
Strip During a feast Seth offers a splendid coffer to anyone who fits perfectly inside it
Strip All the Guests try the coffer but only Osiris can lie down inside it
Strip Before Osiris can leave the coffer it is shut fast by Seth's servants and thrown into the Nile
Strip Isis seeks her lost husband
At Byblos she sees the coffer caught in the branches of a tree
Strip She hides Osiris in a swamp but Seth learns of her actions and determines to discover his brother's whereabouts
Strip He finds him and cuts him into pieces which he hides throughout Egypt
Strip The faithful wife succeeds in recovering of the pieces
Strip She puts the body back together and prepares it with oils and perfumes
Then she wraps it in bandages
He appears almost reborn
Strip After that she lies with him and conceives their son Horus the Falcon
Strip who one day will avenge his father henceforth King of Dead
After you placed the strips in this order it's really getting hard
I can't tell you which tiles have to be replaced or not
This differs from game to game
But you are lucky that the correct order of the tiles is the same in every game
On the image below you see the correct solution
On the other hand the images of the tiles have to correspond with the sentence on the strip
So you could do this one by yourself also All tiles and strips on the correct places If you did this correct the priest will give you a talisman
If not you did something wrong with the tiles and or strips
When you received the talisman use your map to go to the beach
On the beach turn to the right and go forward one time
Turn to the right and walk to the boy that's fishing with a net at the end of the beach
Talk to him and you'll learn that doesn't catch a single fish
Offer him your talisman
After that he catches loads of fish
And not only that he also catches some kind of small scale
Take it from his net
When he asks you if you want your talisman back you refuse it of course
Why should you take it back
You only had to solve this minor puzzle with the strips and the tiles right
In exchange he gives you a stone icon
Don't forget the scale Use your map to go to
Climb up the stairs and walk towards the sarcophagus
Use the stone icon to open it
Pick up all the colored feathers
Turn to the left and you'll discover some kind of pin sticking out the pillar at the left
Place your scale on this pin
Your goal is to find the heaviest feather
You have ten feathers and one of them is heavier than the others
I can't tell which one is heavier than the rest because this differs from game to game
Simply use the scale to find out which one is the heaviest one of all
One tip once you found out that one of the feathers isn't heavier than another feather you can count that one out
After you found the heaviest one put back all the other feathers into the sarcophagus
Be sure to keep the correct feather in your inventory
The weighing has begun Now go back to the temple with the high priest
When you're standing in front of him turn to the left and place the correct feather on the pillar
If you've placed the correct feather the Pharaoh dies and goes to heaven
If you placed the wrong feather the Pharaoh dies and goes to hell to be never reborned
When the Pharaoh has gone to heaven turn to the right and place the Ankh cross on the pillar
The Pharaoh will be reborn now For the last time use your map to go back to the cave where you found the Ankh cross on the altar
Walk to the box on the altar
When you're standing in front of the altar get the mysterious box from your inventory and open it
You'll be teleported to the cave where it all started
Open the mysterious box with the beetle Click on the image below to go to the next part The Snowy World
WALKTHROUGH BY MALCOLM SCHMIDT GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
The opening cutscenes A quot Bad Guy quot breaks into a chamber with his pickaxe and finds the Crystal Skull
Now all the power is his or so he thinks
You are driving in the desert and a gazelle causes you to have an accident
A Nomad takes care of you
He tells you some bandits have taken over his people's well
You have to see what gives
Go forward and find the guard
You may ignore him which is the best choice
If you decide to speak to him you will have three questions available but you must ask only one
Do not speak to him twice
If you don't believe his warning or mine he will shoot and you will need to replay
Exploring you can go either right or left from the guard
To the left there is a path that winds up and around the hill giving you an overview of the area
Visible across the valley is a cave
Reach the cave by going right from the guard
As you arrive at the hilltop facing a large rock outcropping either way you step has the same result
A guard approaches with intent to do you harm but he is stopped by the Targui
Go through the stone arch to find the cave
Walk right in there's nobody home
Inside you discover some scientific equipment Surprised we didn't have to find a generator and get it going first
that appears to be monitoring the environment
Video audio possibly seismic information
Somebody's studying something alright
Straight in from the entrance is a round illuminated area featuring a scarab
The cursor indicates you should be able to go through but you cannot
You have a puzzle to solve first
Look on the floor
A circle with icons at the top representing hands feed and head
Think of Leonardo's famous anatomical drawing of a human figure standing in a circle
Look in your inventory to find a disk and a stick
Place one of the items in the circle then the other
They work together to create a spinning top
Experiment with the top by placing it on one of the icons
The top spins takes a path that may lead it to one or more of the locations on the circle until it settles on its own spot and becomes a star
If the top passes by a star that is already present it extinguishes it
The object of the puzzle is to illuminate all five stars Head Right Hand Left Hand Right Foot and Left Foot
Only by choosing them in the correct sequence can you succeed Click here for the Solution With all five stars in place the magic membrane is accessible to you and you enter an Egyptian style room complete with sarcophagus
Looking to the right we see this pictogram on the wall
As an experienced Egyptologist you immediately recognize the bottom one
The symbols are familiar
But what is that set of symbols in the top group
The wavy lines at the bottom may mean water the star is well a star but a pentagraphic star is not commonly found in Egypt
And whatever is that pointy thing in the middle
Let's turn around and go to the opposite wall
Here is a star with the Eye of Horus in the center
Touch one of the side arms of the star and the eye rotates
Now does that top pictogram give you any ideas
It would seem to represent our star puzzle and instructions how to manipulate it
That's it
Left right right left right
The sarcophagus opens and Eeek
He needs a facial
He's your personal Psychopomp
I certainly hope he hasn't lost his flying skills
After spending three thousand years in a limestone box I know I'd be rusty
You land at the foot of a great Sphinx
Go into the temple
You get this story Pharaoh is dying and needs help
We need to find a feather so that he can die and be judged and the symbol of life the Ankh so that the Bennu Bird can die and be reborn
Go back to the Atlant and speak with the psychopomp about everything
As you get in the map pops up
Hovering the cursor over the map reveals five regions The Temple of the High Priest and the Temple of the Ankh both in the Sphinx the Temple of Isis the Island of Feathers and the Fisherman's Beach
We have two items to recover
Let's check out the Temple of the Ankh
Just go in open the chest and take the Ankh
Nothing to it
Now go the the Temple of Isis
She says the story needs help
Check the tiles on the back wall
You find pictorial tiles and verbal ones
The only logical way to approach this jumble is to make a list of the quotations then decide on a sequence that makes sense Click here to see the quotations in order Then with the verbal part of the story assembled decide which picture goes with which quote Click here to see the tiles in order Hey
Don't peek unless you really have to
Whether you cheated or whether you really figured it out Isis doesn't care
She is grateful to have her heritage restored and gives you a lucky talisman
Don't forget to talk to the Psychopomp between tasks
He gives you advice
Now go to the fishing beach and talk to the kid
He is having no luck today
Give him the Luck Talisman and change his luck
Check out the net
You don't want a fish thank you but that little piece of junk and the pretty stone might come in handy
Now go to the Feather Island
On the island you find a stone chest with the same image as on the pretty stone
Use it on the lower section of the chest and take the feathers
Turn left go to the pillars and find the stick projecting from the left pillar
Hang the quot junk quot scale on the stick
Now you can weigh the feathers
Weigh one against the other until you find the heaviest feather
Notice that the scales are out of balance
Do it like this place any feather on the left tray
Place another on the right tray
If nothing happens keep changing the feather on the right until you find one that is heavier
Then move that feather over to the left tray
Repeat the process until you cannot find any feather that will depress the right hand tray
The color was randomly selected just for you when you began the game so there is no quick answer
You must do the weighing yourself
The Atlant has a one feather load limit so leave all the other feathers in the chest where you found them
Return to the High Priest's Temple
Place the feather on the stone
If you have the correct one Pharaoh's soul rises to the heavens
If not he is doomed and you are sent back to find the correct feather
Place the Ankh on the other stone and witness the death and rebirth
Now the trick is to figure out how to leave this domain
Let's see are there any loose ends
Anything magical out there that might help
Check the scarab in your box
It has been reborn and turned golden
Does that give you any ideas
Not sure where to go Click here for the answer
You are back in the room where you found the Psychopomp
Exit through the membrane and go outside the cave where you will see your Targui friend under arrest
An automatic series of scenes follows where you meet the guy in charge
We don't know his name quot the chap with the gun quot but he seems to enlist our help whether we really want to or not
Pick up the skull and enter it
You are in a surreal world the Interdimension
Possibly the scene represents the inner workings of a brain with connections between nerve cells
Some of the floating globs can be accessed
At one loction there are several that look like a room with checkered flooring
Enter one it doesn't matter which and try some of the doors
Whatever you do you keep entering a duplicate room
To exit just turn all the way around and go out the main door
At another node there is one glob that looks sort of like an eye
It is the room at the Hoggar where you entered this dimension
The eye effect is just the round membrane entrance to that room This is the exit from the brain world
At that same node if you turn all the way around there is adolphinfloating there
Speak to her and she says quot Seek beyond the corridors
Begin by passing through thefirst door on your left then the third on your right quot If you have not visited the corridors that's all she says
If you exit back to the Hoggar and examine the pillar with the human figure it comes to life and asks quot What lies beyond the corridor quot If you have not been in the corridors you don't know and he turns to stone again
Men
If you have visited the corridors then the dolphin has much to say
Ask her about everything
Then exit and go talk to the man in the pillar
He tells you the history of the skull
Now there is an object floating in the air
It is a magical wind chime
Touch it and receive a new object theremote control
It gives you access to four areas
At the top left the stones represent the landscape outside and take you to the beginning
That segment doesn't work by the way if you press it it will just break
On the right the flint arrowhead takes you to the stone age on the lower left the object that sort of looks like a balloon because it is really upside down
It's a minaret and takes you to Baghdad
The center object represents the membrane eye of the Hoggar complex where you are now
Let's go back in time to the Palaeolithic age
Press the right hand triangle
CD users will change to disk one at this point
You are in the stone age
It also feels like the Ice Age
Your companion decides to try for some elephant meat
His aim with the spear is less than ideal and there is one grumpy mammoth coming our way
We manage to find shelter in the cave and the mammoth has no intention of letting us leave
Let's explore
Ooops
You slip slide throught the chute and Thud
We're due for some out of body quality time
If you try to visit your companion upstairs he can't see you
You realize you are a ghost
Back downstairs downchute
walk behind your body's head and into a cave where you find remnants of a fire on the ground
In your inventory is a wooden stick
Use it to rekindle the fire
Voil wolf shadows on the wall
If you click one it goes into position ready to fight
If you click another the fight ensues and leaves one victorious
Choose alternate sides leaving the White Wolf for last establishing him as leader of the pack
He becomes grateful which will come in very handy in a little while
He also shows you the way out
Follow him through the wall
Whoooo
Now that was a surprise
We land in another imaginative world complete with a floating jelly fish shaped thing
As you might suspect our goal is to get there somehow
Swimming over is not an option
Walk forward once look down and to the left and pick up thetree stump
It's a good thing you have deep pockets
Go to the far end of the island
There is a forward cursor there but it doesn't work
Try putting the stump down at the base of the dead tree
Well there's no going back I guess
We can't let a lil' old sabre toothed tiger stop us can we
Before you move look down and to the left and pick up apebble
Then go forward once toward the tiger
Look down to the right and pick up abranch
Don't step forward to the left or you will be featured on the menu
Don't step forward to the right or you will find the quicksand
Instead wait until the tiger is behind the big rock and toss the pebble at him
The tiger loses his composure and forgets to avoid the quicksand
Ta ta for now darlin'
Stay on solid ground and go to the far end of the island
There is a rock which you can dislodge with that branch
It provides a stepping stone to the next island
Tigers and bears oh my
I don't think we're in Kansas any more
Now it's payback time for your friend theWhite Wolf
Go to the left downhill toward the bear
After you step through the hole there is a growling sound behind you
You have invaded the territory of theBlack Wolf
Go back through the hole up the hill and toward the White Wolf
Your friend takes care of the Black Wolf and you may proceed
Go back down through the hole and find along stickon the beach
Go up the grassy slope find the spot on the shore to use the long stick and vault over to the bear's island
Thankfully the bear is busy fishing and we can pass behind her without being disturbed
Go to the end find thedead tree which is useful as a personal flotation device
Now it's possible to reach the floating world
Up you go
Have a good look around as you climb
Finally go right up into the center
Isn't that just too too much
Woah
There's the skull and the spear launcher
If you pick up the skull first you don't have the spear chucker
You wind up in the brain
At the dolphin's node the bubble to Hoggar is gone but there is a new one that returns you to the floating thing
Speak to the dolphin She gives youtwo more cluesto the corridors fourth door on the left and third door on the left
You could go find some corridors and experiment but it's not necessary
Go back to the floating place and pick up the spear thrower now if you didn't get it before and exit through the floor
Now make your way down the ramp nearly to the bottom looking at the pillar as you go
When you find theimage of the White Wolfin the rock enter it
You are back in the wolves' cave
Go to the main chamber where your body is
Walk toward your feet then look right to see a small stone bridge
Go across into a chamber where the cave art animals are running around the perimeter of the room Find the spearon the ground and throw it at the animals
You must lead your shot that is throw the spear in front of your target
It is easier if you rotate the view as you throw
It is also easier if you wait until the animal is running across the plain wall rather than the area where there are pillars in the way
Each time you strike an animal you gain it's heart
There are four in all the elements Earth fire water and air
When you have all four return to your body and revive it thus starting at the foot the closest one you come to see the element for earth
Place the earth heart there
Going counter clockwise the other foot next the sequence is fire water and air
You come to life
Go up to your companion and give him the spear thrower
He uses it to dispatch the mammoth and you are free to go
Back at the Hoggar
turn around and use the remote control to change the environment to Baghdad
You are in an earthen jar
Step out and see the cutscene where Sheherezade is telling a story to the Caliph
You assume the role of the thief who has sneaked into the merchant's house
There is a guard in the courtyard who will not be friendly if he finds out you are there
See the cat
Cats can be a nuisance but maybe this one can help
Look to the right and find the jar of fish
Open it and the cat takes a fish and runs off
Walk forward once and to the right once and find a pebble on the ground
Toss it to the far left distracting the guard
Then you can go farther right and take the ladder
Turn around go to the balcony and use the ladder to go up
When you arrive your pal the cat greets you then proceeds to tip over a large vase alerting the guard
Immediately go into the door the maiden's room
She hides you under the bed saving your life
In return she wants a beautiful black rose
The thief knows a wizard and goes to his garden in search of a black rose
This is a complex area and difficult to describe
Central to the area is the tall spiral structure the Serpent Tower
It has steps leading up to it on all four sides
Around the perimeter of the area are several structures Three pagodas
small buildings red blue and green housing a dancing girl
If you try to approach them your way is abruptly blocked by a burly sword wielding guard that looks like a second cousin to Bres the ogre in Atlantis II
He's missing a chromosome or two by the looks of it
You will also find a reflection pool with a stalk of bananas on one side and a monkey juggling three sticks on the other side
In one corner there is a stone grotto with a very grouchy Griffin standing guard over a jewel box
Over his head is a cage that looks like it could be lowered
Near the grotto is a decorative device that may have something to do with that cage
Nearby is a gazebo with a pond and some sort of gadget with a circular depression
That's enough sight seeing
Let's get to work
Right where you first came in is a stairway leading up to an L shaped corridor
Go in there and find thelong stickin the left hand branch
Go to the reflection pond and use the long stick to knock down abanana Take the banana to the monkey and give it to him interrupting his juggling
He gives you a smooch then a funny face and runs away leaving histhree sticksbehind
Take them
Go see the griffin in the corner
If you look down and to the left there is a nice bigwhite pearljust sitting there
Take it
Go to the gazebo and put the pearl orb in the round depression to open a puzzle
This is the Unicorn's garden and it is your job to guide him to the exit at the upper left
Use the four jewels found on the bottom edge to coax the unicorn into making the correct turns
Place them just quot around the corner quot where you want him to turn Click here to see the solution After freeing the unicorn you are rewarded with his horn
Go to the device near the grotto use the horn on it and lower the boom on that dratted griffin
Now you can get to thejewel box Open it and take thethree jewels
It's time to visit the three dancing girls
When you approach their dwelling a guard appears One pops out of a flowerpot isn't he cute with that daisy stuck to his head
and the other two seem to fall out of the sky
To get past the guards use thematching colorstick from the monkey
The guards fold up their wares and vamoose
Talk to each girl give her the correct gem and receive two keys and a map in return
Now you are able to get into the spiral tower
Go there and use the brass colored key on the lock
When you enter your friendly neighborhood gargoyle appears
He beckons for you to enter
Wait a few seconds and he plants a huge kiss on your screen
Isn't he adorable
Click on him and the game begins
No instant solution sorry
This is a variation of the old board game quot Serpents and Ladders quot originally played with dice
There is a version of it in the Egyptian section of TimeLapse
The idea is to get to the top before your opponent
If a move lands you on a star you spring ahead and your opponent is thrown back
If you land on a snake you are thrown back and your opponent is advanced
This version is a little different in that you don't have dice you have a sub game where you are able control sort of the number of steps you want
The monkey climbs picks a coconut and slides down
You can decide when the monkey throws the coconut with the red button
Higher up fewer steps at the bottom six steps
Check the map to see where you and the gargoyle are
When you go up he goes up an equal amount
If you have any control you can either place yourself on a star and get a jump or place him on a snake and send him back
You will need to bypass him in order to win
Either skill or luck will prevail
The first time I played this I hadn't found the green girl and made it to the top on the first attempt without the map
The moral there is not to try too hard
Just plug away and you'll get it sooner or later
At the top use the Silver key to unlock the door
A flying carpet I always wanted one of those too
appears and takes you to the wizard's hideout
You watch while the Genie gives the wizard the skull and the wizard visits the Interdimension and just like the quot chap with the gun quot can't remember the instructions
Maybe he should play adventure games and learn to take notes
Let's not tell the wizard how to find the walkthrough
Go in and face the Constellation Puzzle
This in my opinion is a toughie
What makes it hard is not so much the patterns themselves
but the way the D view distorts the layout on the floor while you are trying to match the constellations in the windows with the pattern
You must find the five constellations seen out the windows in addition to the serpent pattern on the wall behind you
This was a struggle
For a big boost Click Hereto see the individual constellations solved
When you have done them all there is only one star not included
The rest fade and you must find the shortest route to the top of the Serpent ConstellationClick Herefor that one
You are bounced back to the wizard's hangout this time without the cobras
Whew
Go upstairs and turn left to face a puzzle box
Observe that each column and each row contains one each triangle up down right or left
When you select a triangle up for example another triangle of the same orientation reacts either by going in or out
Lets's number them to starting at the top left
Notice the four that have mouldings around them
Numbers and
The object of this puzzle is to raise those four symbols and none others Click Herefor a way to do it
Solving that one you hear a click indicating that something is unlocked
At the bottom are four drawers that contain clues to the next puzzle
As you take the last one the puzzle box rotates to reveal another puzzle
Sixteen drawers all empty
What gives
The object here is to open four of them
Not only that you must open them in the correct sequence Click herefor the answer
The box opens and you have a rag and a Genie's lamp
As you rub the lamp Genie appears and gives you your thr


oops
One Wish
We started out looking for a black rose so that is the item you desire
Genie is gone but isn't that convenient
Here's our trusty skull
In you go
Remember to not get lost just turn left to the very next path and step forward once
Stop there and turn all the way around to speak to the Dolphin
She gives you the final two clues to negotiate the corridors
Don't go searching for corridors now they're not accessible
Instead use the bubble right there to return to the Wizard's room
Exit the room via the door how quaint

Study the cylinders and note that they gray cylinders rotates but have a blank circle
The stationary cylinders have red segments on the circle
The position of the stationary cylinder denotes which stand it gives the hint for the top left cylinder is for the left battery stand the middle second row cylinder is for the middle battery stand and the bottom right cylinder is for the right battery stand
The circle denotes how many quarter turn the battery stand will make
A complete white shows the battery stand does not turn
So a quarter of red in the circle means that the battery stand turns one quarter half red means half turn movements and three fourths red means the battery stand will move ths of a circle or times
Time to do the battery stands across the room

Place the new battery on the left battery stand under the empty slot of the lid

Check the hint cylinders as to where to position the middle and right batteries so that it will fit the slot on the lid of the battery stand when the turn ends
red of clue cylinder means position the battery to be one hole away from the open slot on the lid

The house has mirrors in each corner a backdoor and a table with tuning forks of different colors
Theclue for the tuning fork puzzleis behind the table when you first enter the room
When picked up it will be seen in the journal
Correlation of circles on the table and the mirrors on the wall Mirrors See that there are mirrors on each corner of the room
When clicked each mirror produces a series of tones
Under each mirror is a set of bars that made the series of tones
They can vary in length
Above the set of bars is a curve that shows the position of the bars in the series of tones
The tones start at the wide part of the curve as shown by the clue paper
Tuning forks On the table are circles that have holders for tuning forks
Each circle on the table has that curve that shows the position of the tuning forks in the series of tones produced
The curve and the tuning forks are colored
The curve starts on the left and goes counterclockwise
Based on the clue in the drawing found behind the table the first tone tuning fork is on the left the second on the front the third on the right and the last at the back of the tuning fork circles
Above each circle is a round crystal that when clicked produces the sound of the set of tuning forks if they are inserted
Note If the active cursor disappears exit the game and replay from a saved game

Find which tuning fork circle matches which mirror
Click on the round crystal above the tuning fork holders and match it to the sound a mirror makes
The purple curved circle that is at left end of the table corresponds to the mirror left of the entrance
The green curved circle to the right of the purple one on the table corresponds to the mirror left of the back door
The pink curved circle on the right side of the table corresponds to the mirror right of the back door
The gold curved circle on the right side of the table correspond to the mirror right of the entrance

Check the position of the bars under the mirrors and correlate it to the position on the tuning fork holders on the table
This is based on the curve above the bars of the mirror
The only mirror that is similar in position to the tuning fork curve is the mirror on the right of the entrance
This mirror is the one that is matched to the gold tuning fork circle
The rest of the mirrors are opposite in position of the tuning fork circles on the table so the placement of the tuning fork is reversed
Left side of entrance Purple tuning fork Right side of entrance Gold tuning fork Left side of backdoor Green tuning fork Right side of the backdoor Pink Tuning fork

Introduction To make your way through Auryn Quest move the mouse to indicate the direction you want to go you do NOT have to hold down the mouse button and press the ldquo W rdquo key to go forward You may find movement easier if you first hit the F key each time you begin play ndash this gives you a standard orientation To acquire Power Balls or perform other actions walk towards the object or walk through it To jump forward press the ldquo W rdquo key and the space bar To run jump press ldquo W rdquo Shift and the space bar
To find out how many Power Balls you have in the current level press the ldquo P rdquo key To go back to the Temple opening area press ldquo Escape rdquo ndash be warned though that if you do this all the Power Balls you collected up to that point in the level will be lost When you re enter that particular level you will have to reacquire all the Power Balls Once you acquire all Power Balls in a particular level and use the transport device to transport to the NEXT level you have officially cleared the level The game continues to give you credit for having all Power Balls even if you return to replay the level
During your journey you will see blue pulsating lights from time to time These Blue Pulsars though they aren rsquo t really gamesaves give you a location to return to when you fall and die There is no way to save your game in the traditional sense
Jumping in Auryn Quest is affected by where you position the mouse and how long you hold down the keys ndash this will of course vary for each individual Where the walkthrough suggests a ldquo jump rdquo you may find that you need a ldquo run jump rdquo or vice versa The mouse can be used even in the middle of a jump Particularly in mid jump during ldquo run jumps rdquo you may find that it rsquo s possible to change the direction or length of your jump by moving the mouse
Note from mjartisian ldquo I've observed that usually when you get to a spot where you can jump the surface you're standing on will bounce up and down when you stand close to the edge
A built in hint rdquo Temple of a Thousand Doors After the opening cutscenes you find yourself in an area called the Temple of a Thousand Doors Walk around until you find a grey rock cavern Enter and walk into the sparkling lights ndash these sparkling lights are a transport device You will be transported to the game rsquo s first level Mountain of Destiny
Mountain of Destiny Level You will see a brown robed wizard in a red hat standing in front of the carved entry to his house Talk to the wizard and acquire Power Ball which is near him Walk around the rock island in the sky Admire the surreal scenery and the interesting horizon effect You rsquo ll find Power Ball by walking through the opening in the rocks opposite the place where the wizard greets you Once you are through this opening look to the right You must jump up in order to acquire the Power Ball
Walk back around to the house fa ade and go up the stairs Approach the intersection where two paths meet The left path is the Wizard path The right path is the Stone Idol path Turn left toward the Blue Pulsar and acquire it The Blue Pulsars give you a Return Location for whenever you die

Here you are at the Old Gate which you saw in the vision Behind you is a transport device that you will use later after acquiring more Power Balls Acquire the Blue Pulsar Step onto the Old Gate Turn to your left to see a passageway
Walk down the passageway The path splits here left is the Apparent Dead End path and right is the Stone Giant path
Turn left and walk down the passage to an Apparent Dead End with nearby idols Walk to the end of the rock where it falls away into nothingness Look down on the right to see a narrow ledge Step or jump down to the ledge
Walk around the ledge past Power Ball to the end of the ledge Jump up the slight incline Go up above the Power Ball and acquire it by stepping down and falling through it onto the ledge Return to the top of the incline if you wish to admire the view and to see Power Ball
There is an alternate method for reaching Power Ball Instead of jumping down to the narrow ledge turn towards the blue idol face on your right Note from Glynn ldquo You can jump up and over the face on the right and get to a very difficult ball down on a ledge nice little path going down to it it was almost impossible to jump that far from the rocks

endif Once you have acquired Power Ball return to the Apparent Dead End Make sure that it IS the Apparent Dead End ndash you should see idols but NOT an obelisk Once again walk to the edge of the rock where it falls away into nothingness Run jump down to the levitating boulders on your left Turn and jump down to acquire Power Ball You may now jump up the levitating boulders to reach the transport device Or you may jump off into nothingness and die Either action should bring you back to the Old Gate
This time take the right passageway or Stone Giant path On your way to the Giant first walk straight ahead past the obelisk and to the end of the rock and look down There rsquo s a ledge immediately below that leads to Power Ball Acquire it Return go almost to the obelisk and walk down the stairway on your left to the Stone Giant
He has Power Ball at his feet Acquire it Talk to the Stone Giant Walk back to the Stone Gate Use the transport device to return to the boulder near the arrow sign Walk back to the area with the arrow sign

Walk out to the sliding segment bridge Walk across on the individual segments this requires you to time your steps so that you walk forward when the next segment is correctly aligned with the segment you rsquo re currently standing on Halfway across look down to see the brown robed wizard with the red hat Turn around to look back where you just came from and admire the view Go up the circular stair See the spinning boulders Jump onto the first one Spin and admire the view Walk to the edge of the boulder Wait until the spinning motion brings the second boulder closest to you Run jump onto the second boulder Walk over to the edge of the second boulder Run jump to the ledge with the transport device which hovers over an ornamented brown tile Be transported
Go through the Blue Pulsar You will then see two paths the Wizard path to the left and the Obelisk path to the right
Take the path to the right past the obelisk and toward a stone idol As you walk keep glancing to your left until you see Power Ball hovering over a rock island You will need to jump to this island This is just about the hardest challenge in this level Run jump to the rock island You can do this by backing up and getting a good running start then timing the jump perfectly
Note from mjartisian ldquo I did not back up and run
I found a spot between the tall pillars of rock before the fork on the high path where I could make the run jump
This spot bounces
rdquo Once you rsquo ve acquired the Power Ball turn back towards where you came from and run jump to the ledge below Turn right and walk up to the ledge until you can see the transport device Turn again to face the two paths
Take the left path and talk to the purple robed wizard with the blue hat Go to the end of the wizard rsquo s ledge near where the wizard was standing You will see a rough path rock fall leading down Once down follow the ledge until you see a plank suspended between the ledges Step down onto the plank Walk across the plank then turn left and step down to the ledge below
You will see some rough steps leading down to the water At the bottom of the waterfall see Power Ball Acquire it Look around to admire the view Get your feet wet in the water Since the footfall sound doesn rsquo t change you may actually be walking ON the water
Directly opposite the waterfall there is a rock with a smoothed off top Jump up on it Jump up again to another pool The water splits into two streams You can walk along the left stream to admire the view Come back and walk along the right stream until you can jump onto the stairs Keep going up the stairs and along the ledge even when it narrows to nothing Power Ball is near the end of the ledge
Walk back until you reach the first set of stairs Return to the area under the plank Walk over to where you can see the sky You will see your friend the brown robed wizard with the red hat He is sitting next to a transport device with a colorful geometric tile beneath it As you walk toward him look up ndash admire the view of the sliding segment bridge Talk to the wizard See a vision of the Old Gate opening Use the transport device next to the wizard to return to Level rsquo s original location Go up the staircase Acquire the Blue Pulsar At this point it is possible to go back to the Old Gate which has now been opened Do NOT jump down the Old Gate yet ndash the Old Gate will send you to another world and when you return you will have to reacquire all the Power Balls
Use the stairs to go back to the wizards rsquo house Talk to the three wizards Turn to your left ndash a large stone trap door has opened Go down it Walk around to mossy interior Admire the odd creature behind the iron gate
Across the room is Power Ball Acquire it
An Easter Egg from mjartisian ldquo When you see the 'creature' in the cage in that mossy area where ball is if you run into the corner of the crevasse right past and next to the cage aim towards the bottom of that point and you can go through that wall and behind the cage
You'll see that the creature is a really beautiful Black Widow Spider rdquo An Easter Egg from Rckasea ldquo I just remembered that when I first ran this world I got the PB by the spider and looked behind the cage still had more PB's to find and went back up looking for more
I saw the spider floating spinning off the cliff from above
I went back down and the cage was empty
I think she is still out there rdquo You can now transport down to the Old Gate and jump down it
You will be transported to Gaya rsquo s Lava Dungeon You must transport through the Old Gate and arrive in the Dungeon to retain all Power Balls from the Mountain of Destiny level
Gaya rsquo s Lava Dungeon Level You are transported to a giant cauldron of bubbling green slime Jump out Walk forward to acquire the Blue Pulsar Walk down the metal ramp Admire the flame under the cauldron Power Ball is in the corner
Talk to Gaya A gate is now open allowing you to proceed Run jump out onto the metal walkway Look back to admire the view Run jump to the rock walkway Continue on the rock walkway until it bends and on your left is a stalactite that glows partly green Look down to the right to see your next challenge Walk forward to acquire Power Ball Go back to the bend in the walkway near the partly green stalactite Look over the edge again and then step down to the ledge Walk along the ledge until you see Power Ball Acquire it You can continue along the ledge to admire the view but there rsquo s nothing else that you must do here
Jump down to the metal extension that protrudes out above the lava You must walk along these narrow extensions stepping and or jumping onto the next one until you reach a rock cavern with a Blue Pulsar Acquire it Walk carefully along the zigzag path At the end is a cavern with Power Ball nestled amidst some spiky rocks Acquire it Continue down the passageway towards the blue flame Walk along the ledge hugging the right wall You will see a shooting flame Run jump across to the opposite ledge immediately after that flame shoots up Walk into the cave
On your left there rsquo s a passageway ndash you can see a Blue Pulsar further on On your immediate left near the passage wall is a stone switch Use it Jump to the metal walkway Jump to the rock Acquire the Blue Pulsar Jump to the next metal walkway Jump to the rock Jump and walk along the series of rocks to the iron grated walkway There rsquo s a giant blue chopper on the left of the iron grate that sweeps you back once you get about halfway across Hug the far right using the crisscross walkways to stay as far to the right as possible Continue down the passage On your left is a gate that can rsquo t be opened yet
Past the gate you rsquo ll see a giant gear and two metal rectangular arms Down the middle of the rectangles runs a beam like support arm Line yourself up right above this middle support Place the cursor right on the support Run jump onto the support as soon as it comes up flat enough to jump onto Run up the support and run jump to the center pole which has a circular platform
Note from Kayc ldquo When I got to the giant gears with rectangular arms I lined myself up with the first one and when the arms were level I got lucky and made a long run jump to the center pole without getting on the first one after trying several times rdquo Walk around the platform and get a good look at the other gear with a metal rectangular arm going around it Run jump to the right portion of the rectangle and then run jump to the ledge near the right wall
Note from mjartisian ldquo I jumped directly to the right ledge instead of on the moving rectangles here too rdquo Continue down the ledge and go up all the stairs and you will see a Blue Pulsar Acquire it Use the stone lever You will see a vision of a gate opening Continue back into the cavern to find Power Ball Turn around and go back down the stairs Take the ledge to your right this is different than the ledge you came in on Jump onto the platform next to the wall Jump onto the wooden walkway Walk and jump around these wooden walkways until you make your way back to the other side of the cavern where you originally came in
Walk back to the opening on your right The gate is now open Walk through the cavern with the blue green floor Behind the large grey machine there is another stone switch Use it You will see a vision of changes in other parts of the dungeon cavern Retrace your steps until you are near the beginning of Gaya rsquo s Dungeon You can now acquire the Blue Pulsar on the rock
Walk toward the passage that you saw moving in the vision it rsquo s the only one you haven rsquo t explored yet Walk along the ledge until it ends Run jump across to the opposite ledge Run jump onto the geometrical platform Walk along the supports from platform to platform Run jump to the rock corridor When the corridor ends run jump to acquire Power Ball
Retrace your steps back to where you were just before you jumped onto the geometrical platform Face the platform On your left is a rock incline Run jump up it You rsquo ll land on the other side and probably acquire a Blue Pulsar as you land
Head down the misty corridor There rsquo s a squarish hole at the end Step down into it Look around for Power Ball which is near you
Go down the corridor until you see suspended beams a ledge and Power Ball Go to the end of the ledge Step down onto a beam and walk and jump over to Power Ball you have to jump up to reach it After acquiring the Power Ball walk back almost to the ledge On your right is a sharply inclined beam Run jump up it Walk jump and run jump across the other beams until you can see Power Ball This sequence is somewhat difficult because sometimes you are jumping onto beams that you can rsquo t quite see
When jumping to the second and more difficult portion of these beams jump to the middle board it rsquo s flat gives a view of those to follow and is easier to proceed from Remember that you can use the mouse to change the direction of your jump even when you are in mid jump
When you reach the far rock ledge walk along it to the Blue Pulsar Acquire it You will see that Power Ball is out of reach for the moment Around the corner is a switch Use it Turn left and walk down the corridor You rsquo ll find another switch ndash use that too Run jump onto the switch and up to the ledge above Turn left Walk along the ledge and acquire Power Ball You will have to jump up to get it
Walk back down the ledge past the switch in order to reach Power Ball Run jump onto the ornamented support that is in front of you Turn Run jump into Power Ball to acquire it You will probably die when you do this but will return to the location of the most recently acquired Blue Pulsar Go back down the corridor and down the ramp Run jump onto the blue platform Turn to your left Run jump onto the next set of platforms and go up the stairs There is another switch ndash use it Go through the transport device Talk to Gaya Go through the Blue Pulsar Continue up to the fancy transport device
You can now go through the fancy transport device You will find yourself in the Singing Trees Country You must go through this transport device and arrive in the Singing Trees Country to retain all Power Balls from the Gaya rsquo s Lava Dungeon level
The Singing Trees Country Level You transport in and find yourself in front of a rectangular carved relief Turn to your right to the two stone inclines ndash you rsquo ll see some odd views if you run jump up them
Go through the stone corridor Look to your right as you pass the alien plants ndash you will be spending some time later down on this plateau
Go partway down the steps On your right see Power Ball Run jump to acquire it Continue downstairs and through the corridor Acquire the Blue Pulsar Admire the view of the Blue Pool area Jump down to the blue moving platform and jump across to the final ledge
Note from Becky ldquo Dying here is surprisingly easy Just think how much trouble you would have saved yourself if you had only learned to swim rdquo See the crank Use it Run jump to the wooden arm with Power Ball on it Acquire the Power Ball Run jump back to the blue ledge Jump to the moving platform when it touches the ledge Ride around and admire the view When the platform docks at the blue levitating stairs jump to the stairs Jump up to the platform with the switch Use the switch Turn and admire the view Go through the door and acquire the Blue Pulsar Come back out to the ledge and run jump to acquire Power Ball Step down to the moving platform and ride it back to the ledge with the switch Go down the corridor Hear a voice Hmm A lever box with a missing lever Hey is this a PUZZLE Admire the door Continue down the corridor Hear chanting See the open plateau with two Power Balls and an open corridor off to the far right Go down the corridor on the far right Approach the pig looking things Hear voice See Power Ball Jump down very close to it and acquire it Go back upstairs hugging the stairs as you go If you get too close to the swine they attack you

Behind and off to the side of the crevice are some levitating stones Run jump across Acquire Power Ball Talk to the Grouchy Bark Troll Walk up the planks Go through the door if you tried to go through this door before doing the swine sequence the door will not open ndash the swine sequence triggers something that makes it possible to open the door Walk down to the moving blue rectangles Jump down on the rectangles There are corner ledges in the wall that will sometimes catch you if you miss a blue rectangle and fall one of these supports is invisible and you find yourself standing on air
The last blue rectangle goes by an opening in the rocks Run jump to the opening Acquire the Blue Pulsar
Continue down the passage See the wooden elevator
An Easter Egg from Glynn ldquo I got on the base part when the elevator was up Elevator came down hellip I was a quot Pancake quot hellip I did this times you are actually stuck between the elevator and the floor hellip I managed to get out by moving the mouse around run jump and whatever else keys I could hit hellip rdquo Note from mjartisian ldquo hellip when you see the elevator floor is not level it means the elevator is up You can jump on the base and trigger it then jump back and wait for the elevator to come down and ride it without getting squashed rdquo Step onto the floor of the wooden elevator when it is in the ldquo down rdquo position Turn and jump out at the top You are back at the Blue Pool Admire the face in the wooden floor See the crank Use it Step over to the device that has just risen out of the water A voice tells you that you now have water You need to get back to the Grouchy Bark Troll One way is to turn around and go back down the passage and jump up the blue rectangles that you recently jumped down Alternatively you can jump across the Blue Pool as you did when you first entered the area and make your way back to the Grouchy Bark Troll that way
Talk to the Grouchy Bark Troll again He tells you that you can now get the lever Go back to the swine Hear a voice tell you that you have the lever Go back to the plateau and find the original passage in the rock Follow the passage until you get to the lever box that rsquo s missing a lever Approach it to replace the lever The door opens ndash look up to admire the animation
Enter the carved corridor Like wow Go to the end Turn around and look back down the corridor to admire the view Go through the carved columns and down the steps Acquire the Blue Pulsar Go to the end of the dock Admire the large lily but don rsquo t jump in it yet The lily becomes a transport device and using it takes you to another world and you will lose all your progress if you haven rsquo t collected all ten Power Balls which at this stage you haven rsquo t
Go back towards the stairs There is a ledge on your right Walk along it almost to the smoking rock Do not get too close to the smoking rock If you do magical water is released to fill the pool and you will NOT be able to get Power Ball without redoing the entire level Look across the lake and see the location of the remaining three Power Balls Power Ball is beneath the dock Walk back toward the dock Partway there you will see a green light on your right Walk down this path framed by green rock until you reach Power Ball under the dock Acquire it Continue on this lower path all the way around the pool until you see Power Ball Acquire it by run jumping through it
Continue around and jump up to the smoking rock Approach the smoking rock to release the magical water Watch the pool filling up if you don rsquo t get out of the way it may reach you and you will die Also observe the change in the Large Lily Go back out to the end of the dock On your right is Power Ball Run jump up to it to acquire it Approach the end of the dock again Run jump into the Large now sparkling Lily which is a transport device
You can now go through the Large Lily to transport to the Wandering Mountain level You must transport through the Large Lily and arrive at the Wandering Mountain to retain all Power Balls from the Singing Trees Country level
The Urwerk Gears in the Wandering Mountain Level Jump out of the Large Lily and run jump across to the ledge of the Wandering Mountain Talk to the ldquo Witch rdquo Go in the hut Look around Talk to the creature in the cage After jumping into the ldquo Witch rsquo s rdquo brew to acquire Power Ball go to the three swinging weights To do this wait until the first weight moves to the side then run jump over the weights to the other side this may take a couple of times but it worked Down the steps and across the gears easy to the opening you see Next are the Revolving Rings You can jump or run jump from one to another When you get to the last one run jump quickly to the platform or the ring will dump you off Use the Blue Pulsar to save here At this point you will notice bars that you can walk on There are two different routes that you can take here
Route A take the LEFT bar Near the end of the bar turn left and run jump to the stationary gear In front of you is the first Squasher To your left higher up past the Squashers is a Blue Pulsar Stand at an angle as to head to the second Squasher then to the second stationary gear on your left Be ready to run jump Just as the first Squasher comes down run jump onto the pad and just keep going to next stationary gear Walk to the edge of that stationary gear line up with the next Squashers you can see the Blue Pulsar ahead Just as the Squasher comes down to the pad run jump onto the pad then run jump all the way through to the tunnel and the Blue Pulsar if you run jump the second Squasher will miss you ndash you may not be able to pause at all between these two Squashers and the Blue Pulsar Use the Blue Pulsar
Alternate Route B back at the point where you saw bars to walk on take the MIDDLE bar to the rotating gears
Note from Becky ldquo Sometimes the toothed cylinders up above sweep down to push you off the bar ndash if you can see that this is about to happen run jump onto the tooth of the cylinder If you keep run jumping the cylinder flings you across the room to your destination rdquo Once across the middle bar you will see an area straight ahead and an area to the left with Squashers Go to the right where you will see an opening Go across the gears on the right up the ramp and find a lever This will open the area you saw earlier on the left Run jump over the railing to the first moving gear then run jump to the second moving gear From there jump down to the stationary gear on your right Turn and face the Squashers you will see the Blue Pulsar up and to the right through the Squashers Directly across from where you are now through the Squashers you will see two more stationary gears Ignore the one that is slightly to your left Instead you will be jumping to the one that is slightly to your right Wait until the Squasher has just come down to the pad in front of you Immediately after the Squasher goes up run jump across to the closest pad then turn slightly to your right and run jump across the next two pads to the right stationary gear
Pause and look around you pant pant Two more pads before the Blue Pulsar If you decide to use the pad to your immediate left you will have to wait a bit to catch it at a time when it is lower than usual Time yourself across the two pads and go through the opening Use the Blue Pulsar
Note from Becky ldquo When you are on a stationary gear it is possible by aiming the cursor at the TOP of the Squasher just as it hits the pad to run jump ONTO the Squasher Then continue run jumping over the Squashers to your destination It rsquo s a wild ride but results in fewer squashing deaths rdquo Whichever route you used now that you have the Blue Pulsar it rsquo s time to go on Avoid the teeth of the giant gear by timing yourself Go down the ledge to the round post moving up and down Jump onto the round post Then just keep jumping on the next vertically moving object that will move you a little higher It is very easy to become disoriented here
Note from Glynn ldquo This was confusing to me I think I jumped on the same posts more than once rdquo There rsquo s another Blue Pulsar on one of the Star Shapes at the top so you can get inside the entrance ndash long Jump
Go down the ramp to the Ferris Wheel Steps Jump to get from step to step or run jump to skip a step It is probably easiest to jump from the fourth step to the platform skipping the fifth step On through the gate and the trap door opens You have escaped the Urwerk Once back in the hut head straight for the bars The door starts to move Run to the right and see the opening Exit Whew
On to the rest of the Wandering Mountain
The Wandering Mountain Level Go out onto the long bridge Jump up the floating tiles until you are on a group of semi attached floating tiles Maneuver to where you can see Power Ball back on the top of the bridge Line up across from Power Ball and jump down onto the arch of the bridge to acquire it You will then either fall through the arch to the bridge or you will be flung wildly into space
Go back to the semi attached floating tiles Look down to your right to see a Pulsar they have turned pink for this level Run jump to acquire the Pink Pulsar Jump across to one of the rotating platforms Admire the view Run jump and jump across to the next Pink Pulsar Acquire it Turn around To your left after a series of floating tiles you will see Power Ball Run jump and jump on the tiles to acquire it
Note from Becky ldquo Getting Power Ball was definitely NOT the easiest part of the level I found the challenge to be a bit easier if I avoided some of the tiles by jumping back on the tile I had vacated before getting the Pink Pulsar waiting for it to move into the best position and then run jumping across to the tile that is two tiles away from the Power Ball rdquo After acquiring Power Ball jump to or die and reappear on the tile that had the most recent Pink Pulsar Next to the tile is another rotating rock this time with timbers jutting out Around the rotating rock are a series of floating tiles You must figure out how to get to the top of the rock There are two ways to achieve this
Method A Jump onto the lowest timber as it circles near you Turn around and jump onto the tile that is at the correct height for jumping onto from this particular timber Turn around Not immediately but soon a slightly higher timber will appear You must jump or run jump onto this timber If you are too slow the timber will sweep you off the tile Turn around where you are perched on the timber and wait for the next tile at the right height you can walk further out towards the end of the timber if this helps you Jump or run jump to the tile that is at the appropriate height you can also jump to lower tiles but then you have to repeat the whole process Turn around Wait for the next timber at the right height Continue until you are on the beam that is just below the top of the rock Jump onto the top of the rock
Method B Note from Rckasea ldquo I had found that to jump on a timber spin jump to slab jump back to another timber was too much
I did this twice on my many reruns of the good mountain
Just to take notes you see rdquo Method B requires you to ignore the lowest timber Instead run jump onto the second highest timber as it circles near you ITALICS rdquo hellip jump onto the second timber go back to edge point to the center above top and three key super jump right up there rdquo You are now on top of the rotating rock You can see the timbers below you jutting out Look for the next Pink Pulsar Jump across the tiles to acquire it Walk down the ledge and jump onto the descending tile Look up and jump to acquire Power Ball Get back on the descending tile and jump back to the highest ledge Look out and see Power Ball on top of the other rotating rock Walk out the metal arm or run jump to the middle of the metal arm and finish walking out it The metal arm goes up and down and the tile that takes you to Power Ball moves too Wait until the right moment and jump or run jump to the tile Ride across until you acquire Power Ball Jump back to the ledge or die and reappear there
As you are facing out towards the metal arm look to your left Edge out to the end of the ledge there Run jump across to the next ledge and acquire Power Ball Run jump onto the rock next to you or walk out the metal arm and run jump onto the rock Jump or run jump across the planks it is possible to do this with a very long run jump Observe the flames On your right you will see Power Ball but it is probably unreachable from this position Time yourself and run through the flames
Past the flames look to your left Jump down to use the lever Jump back up Go upstairs Walk into the chain Next you will see a block moving up and down Jump onto it and see the circular platform or turn slightly to your left and run jump straight to the circular platform Slightly to the right straight ahead are more stairs Jump down the stairs Look to your left and jump down to acquire Power Ball Go back up the stairs and run jump to the circular platform See Power Balls and Run jump to acquire them Avoid the spiky gate as you do so Run jump to the last door reachable from the circular platform Use the switch Look down the hall to see the transport device with spider like legs DO NOT USE IT YET Do not even get close to it because it will suck you in if you get too near Off to your right are more floating tiles Power Ball is on the last tile Run jump to acquire it Run jump back and use the transport device
The Labyrinth of Time Level Your goal is to collect all Auryns When you enter you can get no
through by just going straight ahead and jumping the areas you need to get to them
You will see red moving lights ahead
There you will pick up no
and no

Continue ahead and pick up no

Now you are going to do some sliding down
Move over to the left side on the darker brown edge
You need to stay on the brown edge as you go down
There is an opening that you will have to run jump over on the way down
You will pick up no
and stop
If you don't stop you will have to jump off the edge so you can go back to the top and do it over
You can now walk around the purple ring and get no
and no

Walk back down the other side of the dark brown ledge and get no

Jump off and slide the rest of the way down and pick up no

If you don't have the first don't use the blue pulsar because you can't get back to the top after you use it
Go across the sliding steps and go down the blue ledge on the right and pick up no

Continue on up the blue ledge
To your right is a brownish ledge that curves upward
This was the hardest one for me to get
Stay near the outer edge and use the shift key to run up and when you are almost there jump up and turn your mouse to the right to go in that direction and pick up no
and fall back down
This may take several tries to get it
By this ledge is spinning blocks with no
in the middle
Jump through and pick it up
Continue forward and pick up no

Now you have an area with a long ramp going upward and one going down under
Anytime you are going up the ramp and stop you will slide back down
Go up the ramp and pick up no
and no

Soon as you get no
turn around and slide back down
Now facing the ramps on your right is no

Pick it up and go on down the ledge
Jump over in the middle and get no

Continue on upward and pick up no
and no

You will pass two burning flames and see a dark brown wall with an opening in the middle
Behind this wall is of the auryns
Go through the opening turn left and pick up no

Run to the other side and get no

Continue upward and you will see no
in the middle as you move up jump over and get it
Continue on up either green ledge
You will see two swinging blades
Turn around and behind you is no

Pick it up and turn back around and time yourself to go between the blades and pick up no
and no

I found it easy to walk up to the auryn on the left pick it up go back to the right side use the shift key and run to the other one and on up the ledge
After you get up the ledge turn around and see a walkway over the top of the swinging blades
Go that way and pick up no

Continue on up the green ramp and see blue ledges with no
under them
Go to the center of the blue ledges and drop down on top of it to pick it up
You will land back down where the swinging blades are
Go pass them again and go back up
Continue on and pick up no
and no

Don't go on pass the blue pulsar
Turn around and see no

Go and pick it up
Continue on up the brown ledge
There is a cannon on top
Look down over the edge and see more auryns
The outer ledges have something that will block you when you go down so slide down one of the middle of the blue ledges
When you stop turn around and see the two you saw from above
Move to the brown ledge and go up and get both no
and no

Now walk to both sides of the blue ledges and get no
and no

Go to the blue pulsar
Now you are ready to use the blue pulsar and continue on
You will see spinning blades moving back and forward in front of you
You can use run jump to get over them and get no
no
and no

Go through the area with the spikes they just block you for a minute and they won't hurt you
time yourself and go across the steps between the moving ledges and pick up no

Now you can see no
and no

Pick them up
Now you can see three ledges with wheels going up and down
If you stay in the center of the ledge the wheels will not knock you off
Pick up no

here
On top is no
and no

Pick them up and go through the teleporter and watch the ending

You can only get out of a conversation by hitting the END CONVERSATION response or one of the obvious 'goodbye' responses Starting Point r You start in the entry corridor Mirror Puzzle r The wash room is to the south of the entry corridor
In the wash room there is a mirror
Light reflects off of the mirror and illuminates a patch on the wall
If the mirror is actioned then it moves so that the light now reflects onto a patch of moss on the opposite wall
The lightdissolves the moss and eventually reveals a locked compartment
The outside of the compartment has a map of level on it
The compartment can be opened with the key from the mine head machine puzzle
Inside you will find a shield that is needed in the orrery puzzle Mine Maze Chest Puzzle r The mine maze can be accessed through the wash room
There is a hole in the floor by the door next to the mossy plaque
There is a chest in the mine maze that is locked
To open it you need the key from the well
There is a monster called Sasha in the well
If you try to pick up the key with your hands the monster will attack you
To get the key you must use the tongs from the mine head
They can be found at the top of the ramp
Inside the chest is Niamhs amulet used in a later level
There are also characters in the Mine Maze
The first you meet is Lincoln
He will shoot you if you don't shoot him first
The other is Lurka
He will ask for your help to get off of the ledge he is stuck on
It is all part of the test and he can actually get out without your help but the player does not know this To help Lurka you must go to the MineHead where he will answer questions before you help him out
On the floor in the Mine Maze are a bag of ammo a piece of tapestry used in theBaptistery puzzle and an ancient elephant gun
The ammo is from the Raptor Lincoln and fits your gun
The elephant gun has shot and can be used to kill Tallum normal bullets have no effect on him Mine Head Machinery Puzzle r The machinery in the mine head must be powered up before you can use it
There is a stop cock on the upright pipe in the spa room
When the stop cock is turned a pipe in the spa room moves
It connects to one of pipes
Each pipe controls the power to either the crusher or the saw in the mine head
If you stand at the top of the ramp and look north you get a good view of these machines
Using the crane in the center of the room you must pick up the key block which is not the one directly under the crane
The key block is the block that when scanned reports having an unknown metallic substance in it Using the controls at the top of the ramp you can pick up the blocks and move the crane so that the blocks are dropped into the crusher or saw
You need to drop the block with the key into the saw
If the block is dropped in the saw a key will fall out through the grating beneath it
If the key is dropped into the crusher the key is destroyed
Once you have the key you canuse it to open the plaque in the mirror puzzle The car in the center of the room is used to retrieve the chest from the dock area
This cannot be used until you have opened the double doors in the mine head which is done with a lever in the dock location
Lurka is trapped in a chasm here
He will shout out to you
If you walk up to the side of the chasm you will be taken into conversation with him
If you question him correctly you will be able to find out a bit about the temple and the guardians Baptistery Puzzle r This room contains mirrors
The right hand mirror is broken and allows access to a secret compartment behind
There are stairs at the back of the baptistery that lead up to some loose pieces of tapestry and one piece hanging up
The piece hanging up can be rotated to reveala message
The other pieces must be placed in the empty slots next to the one hanging up
There are four slots and only three tapestry pieces in the room the fourth piece is in the mine maze The tapestry piece that is already up can be rotated and on its back is a clue that the bathwith murky water contains an item
There are baths in the room
One has murky water and one has clear water
Above the murky water is a plaque with symbols that show you how to solve the well room puzzle which drains the bath
To solve the puzzle you must go to the well room and adjust the pipe settings in the puzzle there
The levers pull the pipes in and out and the wheels either move the pipe up and down or rotate it
Match them up with the diagram on the plaque and the bath will drain of water
You will hear water running soundeffect when you solve the puzzle Once the bath in the baptistery has drained you will see a lens lying on the bottom
This lens must be placed on the stone bible which is part of the font in the middle of the room
When you stand on the pad in front of the font and action the lens you will see a movie clip and a secret door will open to your left with a shield
This shield is used in the orrery puzzle Orrery Puzzle don't teleport here go to r and walk In the orrery room there is a computer like device
If you click on this it will start off a puzzle
You must guide the ball to the center of the puzzle
If the ball is half way through a hole it will stop that ring of the puzzle rotating
Between each ring you must pause and rotate it more
The ball can be moved towards the middle using the button at the top right of the screen
If you fail you can exit the puzzle and start again
Once you have guided the ball to the center of the puzzle you are automatically exited from the puzzle
This starts part of the orrery rotating You must also go to the theo chamber and press the button on the inside face of the northern pillar to finish the puzzle and start the whole orrery rotating
There is a theo in the middle of the room
It is constrained by spears
There is a lever on the outside face of the north pillar that moves the spears and kills the theo
Once you have pressed the button the orrery will stand up properly
It reveals a shield shaped hole underneath it that must have a shieldinserted into it the door to the chapel will open
You can use the shield from the baptistery or the one from the wash room To finish level you only need to finish one or the other of these puzzles
This is the end oflevel
To enter level you must go to the cloisters and down the well Tunnel beyond Orrery r Tunnel section contains parchment pages Chapel r There is a parchment page on the organ keyboard
investigate the NE corner and you'll find a confessional click the curtain to draw it aside then look at the keyhole shows a flic of Tobias and Lurka
If you return here at the end of level having been in the dock it'll show you a different flic of Tobias posing as Baphomet
Go west out of here into the vestry Vestry r If you have picked up the note from the organ Philip addresses you here
You need the key from his seat in Edgar's court to open the barred gate and get through to the north door Cloister r There is a parchment page here beside the wellshaft
Stand in the hole and action the ladder to climb down to the drain and level Level puzzles Entry point Drain d
r Tallum is in D between the ladder from the cloister and the T junction which leads to the Edgar's court
He challenges you and will attack you
If he 'kills you you'll be brought round by Tobias in the library
The only way to avoid this is to shoot him using the elephant gunfrom the minemaze
past him is the entrance to Edgar's court outside which is a portcullis with a shield behind it and a nodule sticking out from the wall
You need to get a winch handle to make this work
The winch handle is in the hold of the ship in the barrel of winches
If you attach that handle and action it the portcullis will go up and you can take the shield Edgar's Court R r Edgar's in here
You can talk to him
he offers to strike a deal with you which explains some stuff later
He asks you to get a chest for him from the dock
If you refuse he gets angry but doesn't attack
If you accept his deal he's happy and if you later enter the minehead withthe chest he'll tell you to put it in the saw
If you don't obey his commands he'll attack
If you obey them all he'll stand by the saw device and wait
when you come over to him he'll turn shout at you and attack Some of the seats open I think and contain various objects that you can pick up
The objects include a half eaten biscuit from the L puzzle some pages a pot of ink a small pagan curse object and the key to the vestry gate
Edgar should finish the conversation by going through the guardian door into the gibbets room
The player should not be able to follow him or use this door Lurka's rooms D and D r These are split in half
The player cannot be able to pass from one side to the other
The D side borders D the level entry drain and the D side borders D which leads to the lab gibbets sanctuary and the attack corridor
The D side contains a stick of sealing wax used in L and a corner of a plaque that is a clue to the wafer puzzle in the L shield alcove
It also contains the pianola roll which will sit on the table
This is used in the chapel to start the tobias message and to open the altar
Level lies below the altar but there are bars in the way
To remove the bars you must place the second shield in the orrery Library R r If you get iced by Tallum in D you wake up here and there's a special conversation with Tobias
If you walk in from the drain Tobias isn't there he's behind a screen While wandering about in the library you can Look at the spy device listen to the listening tubes which are arranged at the center of the tables and steal and read the Vision of Hugh book The spy device is behind the red curtain
If you action a mirror it'll move
If you then action the lens you'll see one of animations a view of the execution room or the cathedral or afigure walking along in cobweb's lair level location
The view of cobwebs lair shows the path you must take to avoid the venus fly traps
There is also a key which is used to open the Tobias gate in D D r This has a gate halfway down it
which is opened by the key from the library table The Dock r This is the bit of the dock you arrive in when you get here from D
The lever beneath the tracks on the west wall opens the big double doors to the mine head
At the north end of the wharf is the ladder down to the sluice at the south end is the fissure that leads to the small boat
In the middle is the fissure to the interview room
As soon as you appear on the wharf sasha will appear in the water near you The Dock Track amp Deck r Although this is the same location as the dock you can only get here if you've unlocked the doors from the wharf and driven across from the minehead on the pincer device
Drive up to the end of the tracks and retrieve the chest from the hold of he ship
You get this by going tothe ship location controlling the crane from the poop deck and dipping it first down into the hold of the ship then lifting it with the chest swinging it over the tracks as far as it will go and then lowering it there
Then you take it back into the minehead where Edgar will be waiting for Using the crane on the ship will drop the chest down onto the tracks just past the stop point of the cart
You then grab the chest on the front of the cart and pull the lever to go backwardsinto the minehead
You will find that the lever has rusted and is locked in place
To release it you must get the bottle of Aqua Fortis from the hold of the ship
If you use this on the lever the rust will disappear and you will then be able to take the car back to the minehead
TheAqua Fortis is a type of acid and although it makes the lever temporarily usable the rust was the only thing holding it together so once you get back to the minehead the lever mechanism breaks and you cannot use the car again
On deck as well as the crane there's the prieure sailor who you can talk to and parchment pieces The Boat r As you enter this location from the dock and go down the ramp you will see a plaque overhead which shows the correct orientation of pipes to complete in the Well Room to pipe hot water to this location
If you go to the well room and rig the pipes up and if you thenconnect the hose in this location to the transom of the boat hot water will surround the boat
If you action the winch the boat will carry you across the dock to the land at the other side
If you fail to do the trick with the hose sasha will attack you
If you do nothing she'll kill you
There are other ways to prevent Sascha attacking you Solve the sluice puzzle use the Oisin amulet ink or Aqua Fortis on the water
Once on the land at the other side you can get into the lab R the interview room r When you arrive here Kurt a raptor is waiting in the other half of the room
If you shoot at him he'll shoot back at you
if you don't shoot him immediately he initiates conversation
Consequent on this he might initiate combat exiting conversation or he might continue in conversation
If it's the latter then a Theo comes in behind him
You can choose to tell him about it or make some terrible pun
If you warn him he spins fires then resumes conversation
If you pun at him the theo then attacks him and Kurt dies
The Theo will leave the room if it was not killed nad is crushed by a rockfall at the top of the stairs in the next room
In Kurt's half of the interview room on the desk is a ship's manifest that tells you about what's in the hold of the ship The ship hold r There is a barrel of winches a chest unless it's already been taken by the crane and a bottle
The bottle's label should be legible and say 'aqua
This is used in the chemicals puzzle in the lab
In the barrel of winches is one takeable winch handle
This winch handle isthe one you need to open the portcullis outside Edgar's court
You can exit the hold using the door which gets you out onto the ramp back up to the deck The sluice r This is the way to trap sasha who's supposed to follow you around everywhere
Climb down the ladder and you'll find yourself on a ledge above a door
If you pull the bolt on the door it'll fly up to floor level and you'll get the sound of water rushing in
It'll then slowly subside
Sasha will rush in with it and your HUD should warn you of this
Either at the top or the bottom of the ladder are some taps
These let hot water into the sluice area
If you tuenthe stop cock it releases hot water onto Sasch and she will flee from the dock location for ever
If you don't she will batter through the broken door and next time you visit the location the door will be broken and Sascha will be free The lab R r Philip is standing here
He'll talk to you and may flee dependant on your responses through the guardian door at his side
There's a blasted dead alchemist in the corner of the room with some keys
You need the keys to open either the door to the Attack corridor R or the grate to the drain D The area around the alchemist is poisonous and will kill you before you take the keys
The poison can be neutralized by pouring over it a cocktail of chemicals mixed in the following way On the table are three bottles an empty flask a book
The book can be read in the normal way and gives instructions on the last pages on how to mix the chemicals together
If you mix together moon blood aqua fortis you get the right stuff to neutralize it
Anything with red salt in it blows up auqa fortis first or second in the mix rather than third does nothing You pour the chemicals into the top of the alembic the spouted kettle thing and they will only pour out into the flask which you have to place in the wee flask holder
Unwanted combinations can be aborted by pouring them into the sink in the corner
Next to the alembic rest is a little cleft in the wall which contains Shield yes there are of these just like there were shield 's this doesn't look like it should because it's covered in plaster and shite and isn't usable as shield in the orrery room until it has been washed in Aqua Fortis
Washing it creates the real shield object which is usable in the usual way and on placement in the orrery room floor hole will remove the bars in the space behind the chapel altar
More of this later The attack corridor R r Edgar will initiate conversation in the attack corridor and then attack you here
This corridor leads to some spiral stairs which go up to he chapel
The door is bolted from this side once the door to the chapel is opened from this side you can open it freely from both
If Edgar kills you you wake up in the Gibbets room trapped in one of the gibbets D drain r This just links up the lab the attack corridor sanctuary the gibbets room and the D side of Lurka's rooms
The player needs to take the pianola roll from D to complete level use it in the organ in the chapel R Gibbets room r If Edgar attacks you and 'kills' you you regain consciousness hanging in a gibbet
You can talk to jack then lurka then jack
During the second conversation with jack the worst result is that he buggers off and it's game over you die in the gibbet
The best result is that he opens the bottom of the gibbet and you step out
you and he can then walk to the sanctuary R Sanctuary r You only get in here if you followed Jack having been freed by him from the gibbet otherwise the door into here is locked
there's dialogue with jack during which he takes actions
That's it for this location R Chapel r The first time you enter here from the attack corridor stairs tallum is in here making noises
he initiates dialogue the best result of which is he tells you what to do in this room and then leaves the worst and most likely result of which is he attacks you
take the pianola roll from D lurka's room and put it in the side of the organ there's a wee door there in the side to put it in This opens up the altar and plays the tobias message
Inside the opened altar is a black space with bars across it
These bars are destroyed by putting the Shield in the Orrery room floor
When they're gone and the altar is open you can step through into level Azrael's Tear Guide to Levels and You can only get into level from the chapel by walking into the hole at the back of the altar
This takes you to the entry drain Entry Drain r If you walk down to the end there's a slippery bit of floor by the opening to the execution room which slips you out over the edge
By the walls the floor isn't slippery
Take the pin up the ladder and use it with the socket by the ladder top to engage the cogs
Use it again to tuen the cogs which pulls the rope up
The rope was jammed under the millstone and by pulling it you pull the millstone upright
If you action the millstone it'll roll off and 'kill' the Leo in the execution room
There is flour near the cogs which is used flour in the kitchen puzzle Execution Room r If you fall in here from the drain you land on the floor The Leo will try to attack you but is quite slow so can be outrun
It is also blind but if it does catch up with you it will kill you instantly
Cross the room to the lift
stand in the lift and action the handle it'll go up
The lever next to the lift can be used to recall the lift to ground level if you fall off the rafters at any stage
The lift has positions ground level rafter level and the top level is to the Shield alcove Shield alcove r When you first enter here a ghost will appear
Talk to Vince nicely and he'll tell you how to get through the door
To get through you have to make the correct communion wafers in the kitchen and then feed them into the hole in the gargoyle's mouth
wrong wafers will be destroyed
If you use up all the wafers without opening the door go to the clock and hunt around for the master key a sort of metal round wafer
Once inside click on the statue of jaques de molay
You'll get a message from Tobias and then a hand'll come out with a key
Take the key and Geff talks to you telling you that the shield you need is in the meat locker
The key is used in the model room Kitchen r The door to the execution room has to be unbolted from the execution room side
Use the ropes in the northern alcove to go to the meat locker it's a dumbwaiter
Open the oven and pull the lever to get the biscuit tray breville out
click the lid to open it
there are biscuit moulds with the same heraldic devices as in Edgar's court in level where they were accompanied by names The ones needed for the shield grotto are Tobias' tallum's and malik's
The symbols of these knights are shown on the wall in the cathedral Edgar's court and on a plaque that is foundin Lurkas room with the Pianola roll
These are represented as a crown of feathers or ornate fleur de lys a cross and spear motif and a lion
Use the flour from the entry drain or the wax from lurka's rooms in level to fill individual biscuit moulds then close the lid to press them into the right shape then open it up again and take the wafers
There's a limit on the amount of dough and wax so the player can only make a limited number of wafers Meat locker r If you visit here before talking to Geff in the Shield alcove there will be nothing here except the lift up to the kitchen
The door to Geffs studio is locked from the studio side
If you have already talked to Geff in the alcove he will tell you he has hidden a shield in one of the carcasses
One of the carcasses will be actionable and when clicked on it will open up to reveal Shield
This can then be used on the wall in the Ziggurat to take you back to the Theo chamber Geff's studio r Talk to geff for general info take the notebook on the desk
If you enter the meat locker from here Tree r This is a maze
The only thing in here is a Scorpion
They are very hard to shoot and it is best to run away from these Cobweb's lair r You can get here from the tree only
This is the location shown by the spying device in the library
walk down the branch until you get to the flytrap without spines
walk across it to the branch beyond
There is a mechanical fly trap here
When you action this it will open to reveal a number of documents and a sword hilt Ziggurat r amp Flooded ziggurat r Use shield in the alcove at the top of the curved stairs to rotate the room and put you in the Theo chamber r
There is a section of wall that is false
When you action it it will sink into the floor
Take the shield out of the recess again and walk through from here to the onlyavailable exit to the orrery room r place shield in floor to openmodel room Model room r Use the key from the shield grotto on the obvious hole in the wall
This reveals the models
This shows several locations in level
There are various things you can do the models
Anything you do to the models happens to the real rooms as well aqueduct this will flood then drain out killing the Theo which is the only way through the location when you have the grail poison gas room amp chimney open the doors to gain access to the chimney and one of the escape routes cathedral amp vestry open the door in the vestry to get access to the waterwheel chock alcove and screen lever execution room and ziggurat either of these flood the both locations and large parts of the temple blocking off big areas of level waterwheel chock alcove open the door to let you in here so you have to do the vestry one and the chock alcove one to get through to the waterwheel areaOnce the key's been used in the wall if you go to the little alcove to exit the room and action the shield shape you'll get rotated to the ziggurat and you can then go back amp forth between the locations freely by actioning the shield shape When you enter here with the th shield use it in the second shield recess on the opposite wall to the key hole wall to rotate the room so that the door connects with the orrery again
take the th shield again and use it in the orrery room floor Clock r From either direction you can only get through by setting the pendula going
then its a case of timing your dash through the gap
Hit a pendulum and you're dead
There's a sneaky bit where you have to go along one of the pendulum conduits and go through a connection tunnel bit
The master key to the Shield alcove is found down one of these side passages Cathedral r Avoid the Leo just like the one in the execution room
You can trap the Leo by going into the organ box in the middle of the room
If you lower the pipes the Leo will become trapped between them and the hole in the floor
You can now freely move around the room
Lowering the pipes also releases a brass lever that was jammed up with the pipes
This lever is used in the water wheel chock alcove puzzle Behind the shield screen is an altar on the floor which can be slid back to allow access to a tunnel underneath
the shield screen is raised by solving the water wheel puzzle
There is a door with shield outlines on it
This door is locked until you place Shield in the orrery
The image on the stained glass window is jaques de molay giving out wafers to the three knights needed for the wafer puzzle
Tobias and Malik are named on the window the third knight is tallum recognizable by his spiked shield Crypt r When you go down the stairs by the railings and around the obstruction there the Leo from the cathedral will come into view looking down through the hole in the ceiling
it falls in and dies on hitting the floor blocking your passage back This releases claude from his sarcophagus
The standing sarcophagus with the image of the knight which is down here is the superpuzzle sarcophagus
it has recesses on its front surface
these are to be filled with the masterkey for the wafer puzzlethe sword hilt from cobweb's lairthe signet ring from the swaddled body in the poison gas roomthe stone dagger from the perilous chapel It then opens to reveal several documents Pulpit r You need the key from the medallion in the cathedral vestry to open the ornamental gate at the top of the stairs
The book is the templeisen bible
From here you can look down into the cathedral and see the floor mosaic which Colin refers to a picture of raptors holding up thegrail you will meet him in the Theo Nest Vestry r Action the hook to release the organ pipes
Use the model to open up the door in here
once inside you can do the water wheel puzzle
The cog that is not moving is connected to machinery that raises the shield screen in the cathedral
To raise the screen you must stop the spinning cog engage the cogs and start it spinning again
The first cog now turns the second cog as well and when you go back to the cathedral the shield screen will have gone To start and stop the cogs you must start and stop the water wheel in the room down the stairs
To engage the cogs you must use the lever you found in the pipes on the stump in front of the cogs
When these pieces are together you have enough leverage to push the cogs together There is also an amulet and scroll in here
The amulet contains a key
There is also a secret compartment that contains a brooch
This brooch is used to gain access to the chimney exit The key is used to unlock the door at the top of the stairs from the crypt to the pulpit Theo nest r Don't go too close to the theo and it will stay asleep
action the portcullis to lift it then action the lever on the wall or it'll come crashing down on you when you walk underneath
take the th shield and Colin notices you he's the dead body on the floor Decision point r When you enter you get the Tobias message
If you haven't already flooded the temple Tobias will now do so and you hear the noise of water flooding in
After this Geff will call to you
If you walk over to him he will start a conversation with you
If you say yes to Geff he'll open the door and lead you to the chute down to the light room
If you say no you can't open that door yourself and you'll have to go through the Tobias door and into the scorpion trap Scorpiontrap r Avoid the scorpions go around the maze to get to the stairs at the other side
This leads to the flooded execution room
You shouldn't have gone this way so don't come complaining to me if you keep dying Flooded execution room r Jack poles a drowned Leo over to you
Jack gets killed by Sascha whilst poling the Leo over
You can now walk across the Leo but must be careful not to fall in the water and drown
If you try to cross the rafter Sascha will get you too
To scare off Sascha you must use one of a number of things on the water
These are the Oisin amulet Ink chemicals from the lab or the Aqua fortis Light room r You fall in here from the slide chute from the decision point
The luminous fungus light the room and also the temple by a mirror system
The fungus is also poisonous
All the time you are in the room you will take damage from poison
Therer is a concealed door in the room

If you go up the stairs you will be safe from the poison Malik's lab r There are switches in the middle of the room
If they are thrown in the correct order the zombie theo starts moving
It will kill you if you get in the way
The exit door from this room is locked and the zombie theo opens it
It is the only way to open this door
Behind where thezombie theo was lying is a secret panel

If you open the door and the door is between you and the theo it will run down the passage and try to escape
It will walk into the angel trap and be killed
It is then safe for you to walk through the trap
If you flooded the area in the model room then the theo will be dead and there is no way to get out this exit
You must go by a different route Exit rooms phil's exit D r masonic exit D r If you come here without the grail you can't get through the door and out because there's the grail image barring your way
If you approach with the grail it opens up and you can get out by actioning the door

Starting Point r You start in the entry corridor
Mirror Puzzle r The wash room is to the south of the entry corridor
In the wash room there is a mirror
Light reflects off of the mirror and illuminates a patch on the wall
If the mirror is actioned then it moves so that the light now reflects onto a patch of moss on the opposite wall
The lightdissolves the moss and eventually reveals a locked compartment
The outside of the compartment has a map of level on it
The compartment can be opened with the key from the mine head machine puzzle
Inside you will find a shield that is needed in the orrery puzzle
Mine Maze Chest Puzzle r The mine maze can be accessed through the wash room
There is a hole in the floor by the door next to the mossy plaque
There is a chest in the mine maze that is locked
To open it you need the key from the well
There is a monster called Sasha in the well
If you try to pick up the key with your hands the monster will attack you
To get the key you must use the tongs from the mine head
They can be found at the top of the ramp
Inside the chest is Niamhs amulet used in a later level
There are also characters in the Mine Maze
The first you meet is Lincoln
He will shoot you if you don't shoot him first
The other is Lurka
He will ask for your help to get off of the ledge he is stuck on
It is all part of the test and he can actually get out without your help but the player does not know this
To help Lurka you must go to the MineHead where he will answer questions before you help him out
On the floor in the Mine Maze are a bag of ammo a piece of tapestry used in theBaptistery puzzle and an ancient elephant gun
The ammo is from the Raptor Lincoln and fits your gun
The elephant gun has shot and can be used to kill Tallum normal bullets have no effect on him
Mine Head Machinery Puzzle r The machinery in the mine head must be powered up before you can use it
There is a stop cock on the upright pipe in the spa room
When the stop cock is turned a pipe in the spa room moves
It connects to one of pipes
Each pipe controls the power to either the crusher or the saw in the mine head
If you stand at the top of the ramp and look north you get a good view of these machines
Using the crane in the center of the room you must pick up the key block which is not the one directly under the crane
The key block is the block that when scanned reports having an unknown metallic substance in it
Using the controls at the top of the ramp you can pick up the blocks and move the crane so that the blocks are dropped into the crusher or saw
You need to drop the block with the key into the saw
If the block is dropped in the saw a key will fall out through the grating beneath it
If the key is dropped into the crusher the key is destroyed
Once you have the key you canuse it to open the plaque in the mirror puzzle
The car in the center of the room is used to retrieve the chest from the dock area
This cannot be used until you have opened the double doors in the mine head which is done with a lever in the dock location
Lurka is trapped in a chasm here
He will shout out to you
If you walk up to the side of the chasm you will be taken into conversation with him
If you question him correctly you will be able to find out a bit about the temple and the guardians
Baptistery Puzzle r This room contains mirrors
The right hand mirror is broken and allows access to a secret compartment behind
There are stairs at the back of the baptistery that lead up to some loose pieces of tapestry and one piece hanging up
The piece hanging up can be rotated to reveala message
The other pieces must be placed in the empty slots next to the one hanging up
There are four slots and only three tapestry pieces in the room the fourth piece is in the mine maze
The tapestry piece that is already up can be rotated and on its back is a clue that the bathwith murky water contains an item
There are baths in the room
One has murky water and one has clear water
Above the murky water is a plaque with symbols that show you how to solve the well room puzzle which drains the bath
To solve the puzzle you must go to the well room and adjust the pipe settings in the puzzle there
The levers pull the pipes in and out and the wheels either move the pipe up and down or rotate it
Match them up with the diagram on the plaque and the bath will drain of water
You will hear water running soundeffect when you solve the puzzle
Once the bath in the baptistery has drained you will see a lens lying on the bottom
This lens must be placed on the stone bible which is part of the font in the middle of the room
When you stand on the pad in front of the font and action the lens you will see a movie clip and a secret door will open to your left with a shield
This shield is used in the orrery puzzle
Orrery Puzzle don't teleport here go to r and walk In the orrery room there is a computer like device
If you click on this it will start off a puzzle
You must guide the ball to the center of the puzzle
If the ball is half way through a hole it will stop that ring of the puzzle rotating
Between each ring you must pause and rotate it more
The ball can be moved towards the middle using the button at the top right of the screen
If you fail you can exit the puzzle and start again
Once you have guided the ball to the center of the puzzle you are automatically exited from the puzzle
This starts part of the orrery rotating
You must also go to the theo chamber and press the button on the inside face of the northern pillar to finish the puzzle and start the whole orrery rotating
There is a theo in the middle of the room
It is constrained by spears
There is a lever on the outside face of the north pillar that moves the spears and kills the theo
Once you have pressed the button the orrery will stand up properly
It reveals a shield shaped hole underneath it that must have a shieldinserted into it the door to the chapel will open
You can use the shield from the baptistery or the one from the wash room
To finish level you only need to finish one or the other of these puzzles
This is the end oflevel
To enter level you must go to the cloisters and down the well
Tunnel beyond Orrery r Tunnel section contains parchment pages
Chapel r There is a parchment page on the organ keyboard
investigate the NE corner and you'll find a confessional click the curtain to draw it aside then look at the keyhole shows a flic of Tobias and Lurka
If you return here at the end of level having been in the dock it'll show you a different flic of Tobias posing as Baphomet
Go west out of here into the vestry
Vestry r If you have picked up the note from the organ Philip addresses you here
You need the key from his seat in Edgar's court to open the barred gate and get through to the north door
Cloister r There is a parchment page here beside the wellshaft
Stand in the hole and action the ladder to climb down to the drain and level
Level puzzles Entry point Drain d
r Tallum is in D between the ladder from the cloister and the T junction which leads to the Edgar's court
He challenges you and will attack you
If he 'kills you you'll be brought round by Tobias in the library
The only way to avoid this is to shoot him using the elephant gunfrom the minemaze
past him is the entrance to Edgar's court outside which is a portcullis with a shield behind it and a nodule sticking out from the wall
You need to get a winch handle to make this work
The winch handle is in the hold of the ship in the barrel of winches
If you attach that handle and action it the portcullis will go up and you can take the shield
Edgar's Court R r Edgar's in here
You can talk to him
he offers to strike a deal with you which explains some stuff later
He asks you to get a chest for him from the dock
If you refuse he gets angry but doesn't attack
If you accept his deal he's happy and if you later enter the minehead withthe chest he'll tell you to put it in the saw
If you don't obey his commands he'll attack
If you obey them all he'll stand by the saw device and wait
when you come over to him he'll turn shout at you and attack
Some of the seats open I think and contain various objects that you can pick up
The objects include a half eaten biscuit from the L puzzle some pages a pot of ink a small pagan curse object and the key to the vestry gate
Edgar should finish the conversation by going through the guardian door into the gibbets room
The player should not be able to follow him or use this door
Lurka's rooms D and D r These are split in half
The player cannot be able to pass from one side to the other
The D side borders D the level entry drain and the D side borders D which leads to the lab gibbets sanctuary and the attack corridor
The D side contains a stick of sealing wax used in L and a corner of a plaque that is a clue to the wafer puzzle in the L shield alcove
It also contains the pianola roll which will sit on the table
This is used in the chapel to start the tobias message and to open the altar
Level lies below the altar but there are bars in the way
To remove the bars you must place the second shield in the orrery
Library R r If you get iced by Tallum in D you wake up here and there's a special conversation with Tobias
If you walk in from the drain Tobias isn't there he's behind a screen
While wandering about in the library you can Look at the spy device listen to the listening tubes which are arranged at the center of the tables and steal and read the Vision of Hugh book
The spy device is behind the red curtain
If you action a mirror it'll move
If you then action the lens you'll see one of animations a view of the execution room or the cathedral or afigure walking along in cobweb's lair level location
The view of cobwebs lair shows the path you must take to avoid the venus fly traps
There is also a key which is used to open the Tobias gate in D
D r This has a gate halfway down it
which is opened by the key from the library table
The Dock r This is the bit of the dock you arrive in when you get here from D
The lever beneath the tracks on the west wall opens the big double doors to the mine head
At the north end of the wharf is the ladder down to the sluice at the south end is the fissure that leads to the small boat
In the middle is the fissure to the interview room
As soon as you appear on the wharf sasha will appear in the water near you
The Dock Track amp Deck r Although this is the same location as the dock you can only get here if you've unlocked the doors from the wharf and driven across from the minehead on the pincer device
Drive up to the end of the tracks and retrieve the chest from the hold of he ship
You get this by going tothe ship location controlling the crane from the poop deck and dipping it first down into the hold of the ship then lifting it with the chest swinging it over the tracks as far as it will go and then lowering it there
Then you take it back into the minehead where Edgar will be waiting for
Using the crane on the ship will drop the chest down onto the tracks just past the stop point of the cart
You then grab the chest on the front of the cart and pull the lever to go backwardsinto the minehead
You will find that the lever has rusted and is locked in place
To release it you must get the bottle of Aqua Fortis from the hold of the ship
If you use this on the lever the rust will disappear and you will then be able to take the car back to the minehead
TheAqua Fortis is a type of acid and although it makes the lever temporarily usable the rust was the only thing holding it together so once you get back to the minehead the lever mechanism breaks and you cannot use the car again
On deck as well as the crane there's the prieure sailor who you can talk to and parchment pieces
The Boat r As you enter this location from the dock and go down the ramp you will see a plaque overhead which shows the correct orientation of pipes to complete in the Well Room to pipe hot water to this location
If you go to the well room and rig the pipes up and if you thenconnect the hose in this location to the transom of the boat hot water will surround the boat
If you action the winch the boat will carry you across the dock to the land at the other side
If you fail to do the trick with the hose sasha will attack you
If you do nothing she'll kill you
There are other ways to prevent Sascha attacking you Solve the sluice puzzle use the Oisin amulet ink or Aqua Fortis on the water
Once on the land at the other side you can get into the lab
R the interview room r When you arrive here Kurt a raptor is waiting in the other half of the room
If you shoot at him he'll shoot back at you
if you don't shoot him immediately he initiates conversation
Consequent on this he might initiate combat exiting conversation or he might continue in conversation
If it's the latter then a Theo comes in behind him
You can choose to tell him about it or make some terrible pun
If you warn him he spins fires then resumes conversation
If you pun at him the theo then attacks him and Kurt dies
The Theo will leave the room if it was not killed nad is crushed by a rockfall at the top of the stairs in the next room
In Kurt's half of the interview room on the desk is a ship's manifest that tells you about what's in the hold of the ship
The ship hold r There is a barrel of winches a chest unless it's already been taken by the crane and a bottle
The bottle's label should be legible and say 'aqua
This is used in the chemicals puzzle in the lab
In the barrel of winches is one takeable winch handle
This winch handle isthe one you need to open the portcullis outside Edgar's court
You can exit the hold using the door which gets you out onto the ramp back up to the deck
The sluice r This is the way to trap sasha who's supposed to follow you around everywhere
Climb down the ladder and you'll find yourself on a ledge above a door
If you pull the bolt on the door it'll fly up to floor level and you'll get the sound of water rushing in
It'll then slowly subside
Sasha will rush in with it and your HUD should warn you of this
Either at the top or the bottom of the ladder are some taps
These let hot water into the sluice area
If you tuenthe stop cock it releases hot water onto Sasch and she will flee from the dock location for ever
If you don't she will batter through the broken door and next time you visit the location the door will be broken and Sascha will be free
The lab R r Philip is standing here
He'll talk to you and may flee dependant on your responses through the guardian door at his side
There's a blasted dead alchemist in the corner of the room with some keys
You need the keys to open either the door to the Attack corridor R or the grate to the drain D
The area around the alchemist is poisonous and will kill you before you take the keys
The poison can be neutralized by pouring over it a cocktail of chemicals mixed in the following way On the table are three bottles an empty flask a book
The book can be read in the normal way and gives instructions on the last pages on how to mix the chemicals together
If you mix together moon blood aqua fortis you get the right stuff to neutralize it
Anything with red salt in it blows up auqa fortis first or second in the mix rather than third does nothing
You pour the chemicals into the top of the alembic the spouted kettle thing and they will only pour out into the flask which you have to place in the wee flask holder
Unwanted combinations can be aborted by pouring them into the sink in the corner
Next to the alembic rest is a little cleft in the wall which contains Shield yes there are of these just like there were shield 's this doesn't look like it should because it's covered in plaster and shite and isn't usable as shield in the orrery room until it has been washed in Aqua Fortis
Washing it creates the real shield object which is usable in the usual way and on placement in the orrery room floor hole will remove the bars in the space behind the chapel altar
More of this later
The attack corridor R r Edgar will initiate conversation in the attack corridor and then attack you here
This corridor leads to some spiral stairs which go up to he chapel
The door is bolted from this side once the door to the chapel is opened from this side you can open it freely from both
If Edgar kills you you wake up in the Gibbets room trapped in one of the gibbets
D drain r This just links up the lab the attack corridor sanctuary the gibbets room and the D side of Lurka's rooms
The player needs to take the pianola roll from D to complete level use it in the organ in the chapel R Gibbets room r If Edgar attacks you and 'kills' you you regain consciousness hanging in a gibbet
You can talk to jack then lurka then jack
During the second conversation with jack the worst result is that he buggers off and it's game over you die in the gibbet
The best result is that he opens the bottom of the gibbet and you step out
you and he can then walk to the sanctuary
R Sanctuary r You only get in here if you followed Jack having been freed by him from the gibbet otherwise the door into here is locked
there's dialogue with jack during which he takes actions
That's it for this location
R Chapel r The first time you enter here from the attack corridor stairs tallum is in here making noises
he initiates dialogue the best result of which is he tells you what to do in this room and then leaves the worst and most likely result of which is he attacks you
take the pianola roll from D lurka's room and put it in the side of the organ there's a wee door there in the side to put it in This opens up the altar and plays the tobias message
Inside the opened altar is a black space with bars across it
These bars are destroyed by putting the Shield in the Orrery room floor
When they're gone and the altar is open you can step through into level
Azrael's Tear Guide to Levels and You can only get into level from the chapel by walking into the hole at the back of the altar
This takes you to the entry drain
Entry Drain r If you walk down to the end there's a slippery bit of floor by the opening to the execution room which slips you out over the edge
By the walls the floor isn't slippery
Take the pin up the ladder and use it with the socket by the ladder top to engage the cogs
Use it again to tuen the cogs which pulls the rope up
The rope was jammed under the millstone and by pulling it you pull the millstone upright
If you action the millstone it'll roll off and 'kill' the Leo in the execution room
There is flour near the cogs which is used flour in the kitchen puzzle
Execution Room r If you fall in here from the drain you land on the floor The Leo will try to attack you but is quite slow so can be outrun
It is also blind but if it does catch up with you it will kill you instantly
Cross the room to the lift
stand in the lift and action the handle it'll go up
The lever next to the lift can be used to recall the lift to ground level if you fall off the rafters at any stage
The lift has positions ground level rafter level and the top level is to the Shield alcove
Shield alcove r When you first enter here a ghost will appear
Talk to Vince nicely and he'll tell you how to get through the door
To get through you have to make the correct communion wafers in the kitchen and then feed them into the hole in the gargoyle's mouth
wrong wafers will be destroyed
If you use up all the wafers without opening the door go to the clock and hunt around for the master key a sort of metal round wafer
Once inside click on the statue of jaques de molay
You'll get a message from Tobias and then a hand'll come out with a key
Take the key and Geff talks to you telling you that the shield you need is in the meat locker
The key is used in the model room
Kitchen r The door to the execution room has to be unbolted from the execution room side
Use the ropes in the northern alcove to go to the meat locker it's a dumbwaiter
Open the oven and pull the lever to get the biscuit tray breville out
click the lid to open it
there are biscuit moulds with the same heraldic devices as in Edgar's court in level where they were accompanied by names
The ones needed for the shield grotto are Tobias' tallum's and malik's
The symbols of these knights are shown on the wall in the cathedral Edgar's court and on a plaque that is foundin Lurkas room with the Pianola roll
These are represented as a crown of feathers or ornate fleur de lys a cross and spear motif and a lion
Use the flour from the entry drain or the wax from lurka's rooms in level to fill individual biscuit moulds then close the lid to press them into the right shape then open it up again and take the wafers
There's a limit on the amount of dough and wax so the player can only make a limited number of wafers
Meat locker r If you visit here before talking to Geff in the Shield alcove there will be nothing here except the lift up to the kitchen
The door to Geffs studio is locked from the studio side
If you have already talked to Geff in the alcove he will tell you he has hidden a shield in one of the carcasses
One of the carcasses will be actionable and when clicked on it will open up to reveal Shield
This can then be used on the wall in the Ziggurat to take you back to the Theo chamber
Geff's studio r Talk to geff for general info take the notebook on the desk
If you enter the meat locker from here
Tree r This is a maze
The only thing in here is a Scorpion
They are very hard to shoot and it is best to run away from these
Cobweb's lair r You can get here from the tree only
This is the location shown by the spying device in the library
walk down the branch until you get to the flytrap without spines
walk across it to the branch beyond
There is a mechanical fly trap here
When you action this it will open to reveal a number of documents and a sword hilt
Ziggurat r amp Flooded ziggurat r Use shield in the alcove at the top of the curved stairs to rotate the room and put you in the Theo chamber r
There is a section of wall that is false
When you action it it will sink into the floor
Take the shield out of the recess again and walk through from here to the onlyavailable exit to the orrery room r place shield in floor to openmodel room Model room r Use the key from the shield grotto on the obvious hole in the wall
This reveals the models
This shows several locations in level
There are various things you can do the models
Anything you do to the models happens to the real rooms as well
aqueduct this will flood then drain out killing the Theo which is the only way through the location when you have the grail poison gas room amp chimney open the doors to gain access to the chimney and one of the escape routes cathedral amp vestry open the door in the vestry to get access to the waterwheel chock alcove and screen lever execution room and ziggurat either of these flood the both locations and large parts of the temple blocking off big areas of level waterwheel chock alcove open the door to let you in here so you have to do the vestry one and the chock alcove one to get through to the waterwheel area Once the key's been used in the wall if you go to the little alcove to exit the room and action the shield shape you'll get rotated to the ziggurat and you can then go back amp forth between the locations freely by actioning the shield shape
When you enter here with the th shield use it in the second shield recess on the opposite wall to the key hole wall to rotate the room so that the door connects with the orrery again
take the th shield again and use it in the orrery room floor
Clock r From either direction you can only get through by setting the pendula going
then its a case of timing your dash through the gap
Hit a pendulum and you're dead
There's a sneaky bit where you have to go along one of the pendulum conduits and go through a connection tunnel bit
The master key to the Shield alcove is found down one of these side passages
Cathedral r Avoid the Leo just like the one in the execution room
You can trap the Leo by going into the organ box in the middle of the room
If you lower the pipes the Leo will become trapped between them and the hole in the floor
You can now freely move around the room
Lowering the pipes also releases a brass lever that was jammed up with the pipes
This lever is used in the water wheel chock alcove puzzle
Behind the shield screen is an altar on the floor which can be slid back to allow access to a tunnel underneath
the shield screen is raised by solving the water wheel puzzle
There is a door with shield outlines on it
This door is locked until you place Shield in the orrery
The image on the stained glass window is jaques de molay giving out wafers to the three knights needed for the wafer puzzle
Tobias and Malik are named on the window the third knight is tallum recognizable by his spiked shield
Crypt r When you go down the stairs by the railings and around the obstruction there the Leo from the cathedral will come into view looking down through the hole in the ceiling
it falls in and dies on hitting the floor blocking your passage back This releases claude from his sarcophagus
The standing sarcophagus with the image of the knight which is down here is the superpuzzle sarcophagus
it has recesses on its front surface
these are to be filled with the masterkey for the wafer puzzlethe sword hilt from cobweb's lairthe signet ring from the swaddled body in the poison gas roomthe stone dagger from the perilous chapel It then opens to reveal several documents
Pulpit r You need the key from the medallion in the cathedral vestry to open the ornamental gate at the top of the stairs
The book is the templeisen bible
From here you can look down into the cathedral and see the floor mosaic which Colin refers to a picture of raptors holding up thegrail you will meet him in the Theo Nest
Vestry r Action the hook to release the organ pipes
Use the model to open up the door in here
once inside you can do the water wheel puzzle
The cog that is not moving is connected to machinery that raises the shield screen in the cathedral
To raise the screen you must stop the spinning cog engage the cogs and start it spinning again
The first cog now turns the second cog as well and when you go back to the cathedral the shield screen will have gone
To start and stop the cogs you must start and stop the water wheel in the room down the stairs
To engage the cogs you must use the lever you found in the pipes on the stump in front of the cogs
When these pieces are together you have enough leverage to push the cogs together
There is also an amulet and scroll in here
The amulet contains a key
There is also a secret compartment that contains a brooch
This brooch is used to gain access to the chimney exit The key is used to unlock the door at the top of the stairs from the crypt to the pulpit
Theo nest r Don't go too close to the theo and it will stay asleep
action the portcullis to lift it then action the lever on the wall or it'll come crashing down on you when you walk underneath
take the th shield and Colin notices you he's the dead body on the floor Decision point r When you enter you get the Tobias message
If you haven't already flooded the temple Tobias will now do so and you hear the noise of water flooding in
After this Geff will call to you
If you walk over to him he will start a conversation with you
If you say yes to Geff he'll open the door and lead you to the chute down to the light room
If you say no you can't open that door yourself and you'll have to go through the Tobias door and into the scorpion trap
Scorpiontrap r Avoid the scorpions go around the maze to get to the stairs at the other side
This leads to the flooded execution room
You shouldn't have gone this way so don't come complaining to me if you keep dying

Jack gets killed by Sascha whilst poling the Leo over
You can now walk across the Leo but must be careful not to fall in the water and drown
If you try to cross the rafter Sascha will get you too
To scare off Sascha you must use one of a number of things on the water
These are the Oisin amulet Ink chemicals from the lab or the Aqua fortis
Light room r You fall in here from the slide chute from the decision point
The luminous fungus light the room and also the temple by a mirror system

Therer is a concealed door in the room
Its outline shows up vaguely until you remove the fungus covering it
Once all the fungus has been removed you can open the door and get out
If you go down the stairs you will go to the poison gas room and get continually poisoned and probably die
If you go up the stairs you will be safe from the poison
Malik's lab r There are switches in the middle of the room
If they are thrown in the correct order the zombie theo starts moving
It will kill you if you get in the way
The exit door from this room is locked and the zombie theo opens it
It is the only way to open this door
Behind where thezombie theo was lying is a secret panel
If this is actioned then a wall panel will slide back to give access to a book and some notes
The obvious way to get to the notes is via a narrow passage with scorpion tails
This is a red herring and there is no way through here Waterwheel chock alcove r You can press the lever to start and stop the water wheel
When it is stopped you can walk across the water wheel
Once across there is a large stone block preventing you going down the tunnel
This block is removed by clicking on it with the brooch from the amulet in the vestry or buy opening the door opposite it
this door opens a zombie theo will charge out of the alcove and push the block out of the way and into the water
The door will only open if you have released the zombie theo from Maliks lab
Poison gas room r The door here holds back a wall of poisonous gas
The gas can be released by clicking on the hatch at th bottom of the door
The gas is heavier than air and will flow into the grate in the floor

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
Azrael's TearWalkthrough ByDan KennedyJanuary Introduction Although billed as an action adventure Azrael's Tear contains few of the elements traditionally associated with the action genre
True there are many ways to die in the game the most common involving falling off a narrow path into poisoned thorns biting scorpions gaping chasms deep water and there are a few instances when shooting is required
But really this is a pretty standard adventure game with a few action elements
The game is dark both in mood and in colour taking place in a giant underground complex
The game universe seems to go on and on from one amazing location to the next
The story although confusing is a quite engaging tale involving your quest to find the Holy Grail which is guarded by a number of ancient Knights Templar
The game's secret weapon is its graphics which manage to be simple real time rendered D on one CD
and extremely evocative at the same time
Those looking for the clarity of a Cryo release should look elsewhere the graphics are quite blocky and pixelated but manage to really set the mood and capture the proper tone
The interface is a little difficult to master I found the easiest configuration was to use the four keyboard arrow keys for movement with Page Up and Page Down to look up down and the left mouse button to pick up examine things
As a mostly pure adventure fan who delights in exploring and solving every nook and cranny of a game Azrael's Tear presents a few problems occasionally there is more than one way of solving a puzzle or getting around an obstacle
Even worse choosing a particular path can sometimes prevent you from exploring some locations of the game
My approach with this walkthrough is to present a tour that gets you to all of the locations with some alternative paths discussed at the end
I'll try to take care of some of you quot action avoiders quot as well where appropriate
The Story So Far hellip
Apparently its and everyone's sick things are just not going well
Note to developers next time set your game more than years in the future
Mankind has gone in the dumps for some reason and somehow the Holy Grail has made a strong comeback as a potential saviour of the human race
At the same time sever tectonic upheaval ooh the geologist in me is getting excited has unearthed many previously unreachable archaeological locations across the globe thankfully for adventure players Atlantis was not one of them
A new breed of thieving archaeologists known as Raptors with advanced technology have been scouring the planet using advanced technology and competing with each other for old booty
As a Raptor yourself no you're not Vince Carter you have received a note from a competitor named Colin Scott that indicates he has potentially found the present location of the Grail in Scotland within an underground complex known as Aeternis
Apparently a dozen Knights Templar transported the grail from Jerusalem to Scotland in the th Century
He offers to split the profits with you and naturally you high tail it to Aeternis
You watch a rather cryptic introduction that indicates that the knights have been waiting for almost years for you to show up and try to find the grail
The game then plops you directly into Aeternis
You find yourself in a northeast southwest running corridor with a couple of strange looking lizards running around
That greyed area with the scrolling buttons on the left side of the bottom panel is your inventory
A local map can be seen by clicking on the lower of the buttons next to the inventory right click to go back
The orange y bar near the centre is your health o meter and the button underneath it brings up an interface to load save quit etc
hit the button a second time to remove the interface
The writing on the right side of the screen is your automatic scanner which spits out information whenever you are about to enter a new area or when you click on something to scan it
The cross hair cursor turns into a boxy looking thing when you can scan something like the lizards or the big rock in the hallway
Let's Move Helmet Head
Proceed down the hallway towards the northeast door a compass at the top of the screen tells you which direction you are moving
Grab the piece of paper on the floor half way towards the door
This is a page from the Head Knight Tobias' journal you'll find these pages spread all over the place in here
The pages give little snap shots of the lives of the Templars over the last years
Right click to end the page view the page is now in your inventory
Keep moving to the northeast door and click to enter note the arrow shaped cursor that turns yellow when you are close enough to open the door
Go through the short hallway and read the scan for the next room this is handy when men or beasts are about
The scan tells you that there are exits to the room ahead and quot scalding quot water present
Open the door and proceed in but be careful about walking along the wooded walkway if you fall off you will drown and die
As you move along the walkway note the round valve to your right
Click on it once to turn on the water power to hellip something in the next room
The door straight ahead is locked go check if you don't believe me so turn to the right and exit the doorway at the end of the walkway's right branch
Proceed down the short hallway and read the scan for the next room lots of equipment here exits and a human present mutation
Enter the room and look about almost immediately you should hear a voice calling out for help
Note the big doors to your left locked a funny looking metal car in the centre of the room blocks of granite here and there and the ramp along the far wall
Begin walking towards the mine car keeping to the left of the holes in the floor
Pass to the right of the car and creep up to the large crevice in the floor beyond the car
You will see a strange looking person standing below
Look down and inch up to the crevice until the creature addresses you
Ask him about his name and the quot tests quot if you want to hear the response again hit the quot R quot button in the bottom right corner of the screen
quot Lurka quot is trapped down here he will answer some of your questions before you help him but he may get tired of you and tell you to buzz off
After your conversation is completed if you still want to help him this is optional press the grey patch on the top of the right hand iron train rail just as it starts to cross the crevice the rail will fall into the hole allowing Lurka to climb up and disappear
Now turn to your left and head off towards the exit located south of where you stand
Join the Baptist This room is the Bapistry and your scanner indicates there is complicated optical equipment in the floor
Walk in and examine the stone font in the centre of the room stagnant water and the stone bath in the corner ignore the door to the west for now
Have a look at the mirrors along the south wall the mirror on the far right is broken enough to allow passage to a room behind
Step through the mirror into another room similar to the first
Walk around the stone font and examine it here is your optical equipment along with a stone bible and a pressure pad in the ground
Interesting now walk over to the stone bath and look at the plaque on the wall behind the basin better copy it down
Now walk up the staircase west wall to the balcony above the room
There are frames set up here with the third occupied by a piece of a tapestry and two additional pieces on the ground below the frames
Flip over the third frame the one with the tapestry piece already attached and read the message
Pick up the pieces and place them on the proper frames the one with the red man in the foreground goes in the first position while the one with the marching baldies goes in the second
We are still missing the fourth piece so climb down the stairs and exit the room through the mirror
Exit the Bapistry and re enter the Mine Working Area
Lift and Separate Just after you re enter the mine room click on the large granite block closest to you your scanner should indicate that this piece has a key inside it but how do we get it out
Walk along the south wall of the room and proceed up the ramp to the top
Grab the pair of rusty tongs on the floor here for later and then examine the lever control box four top levers with an additional one located on the front of the box which controls the crane hanging to your right
Now look across the room at the two pieces of equipment on the far wall on the left is a crusher and on the right a giant saw
We'll want to saw the block in half to get the key don't crush the block or you'll wreck the key
Press the second lever to the right and the crane will come towards you and stop
Now press the lever on the far right to lower the crane and then press the front lever to close the claws
Press the far right lever again to raise the crane and click on the block to confirm you've grabbed the one with the key in it
Now hit the second lever from the right this puts the crane back in its original position and then press the far left lever twice to bring the crane to the other side of the room right in front of the saw equipment
Finally press the front lever once more to place the block in front of the saw
The controls for both the crusher and the saw are located just to the left of the door you first entered the room by in the northeast corner
There are two levers on the wall here press the right one to activate the saw hellip uh oh nothing happened
Try the crusher well it seems to work
You will have to exit the room and go back into the wooden walkway room to change the valve setting to operate the saw
Exit the door enter the wood walkway room walk to the circular valve and click it twice to switch the power to the saw
Now re enter the mine area and press the saw lever to operate it
Walk to your left to the spot under the saw and pick up the rather large key now on the ground here
Making Water Proceed over to the door in the southeastern corner of the room open the door and go down the hall to the next room which our scanner says is quot moist quot
Enter the room and go to the right to the large piping panel on the wall
Does it look familiar
It should our sketch from the Bapistry
We can see the five holes the two pipes leaving the holes and the four surrounding valves but the configuration seems wrong
Specifically the pipe leaving the rd middle hole down and to the left appears to be in the right position but the pipe that should be leaving the nd hole from the bottom up and to the right is attached to the nd hole from the top
Pull on the straight lever on the very right side of the panel to unlock the right side pipe and press on the lower right valve to position the right side pipe in the proper configuration
Finally press the lever to lock the pipe back into place
You should hear the water start to flow
Now approach the well on the other side of the room once you get close enough a ghost rises out of the well and asks you about Oisin her beloved
Apparently this lady doesn't know she's dead this happens a lot in Aeternis
Try talking to her but she'll get upset once she realizes she is dead
Once she goes back into the well have a look at the corpse and note the key here
The water is too hot to grab the key so use the rusty tongs to grab it
Once you've got the key leave the moist room and proceed back to the Bapistry
Go through the mirror again and approach the stone bath the water has caused a glass brick to become dislodged and it is now sitting on the bottom of the bath
Grab the brick and place it on the stone bible on top of the stone font
It fits into place but you cannot look through the glass as the tapestry above has not been completed
Exit the room through the mirror and proceed through the doorway in the northwest corner of the Bapistry
What a Sorrry Orrery According to your scanner the room ahead contains complex machinery including a large model of the solar system
Enter the Orrery and note the sorry state of the model lying about on the floor
Your first task is to raise the central turning mechanism of the model
Approach the control panel in the northwest corner of the room and click on it for access
The screen displays a series of circles with a small dot at the top of the panel
You control the downward progress of this dot using the button in the top left corner of the panel
Hit the button once to move the dot down one position and now rotate the nd interior circle by clicking on it so that the opening will allow the dot to progress further downward
Move the dot down two more spots and now rotate the two smaller interior circles so the gap in the upper one will allow the dot to progress downward even further
Again move the dot downward until it reaches the centre of the diagram and the mechanism kicks into gear
The central post has now been raised and is turning but you'll have to leave the room to get the whole thing up and running
Leave the Orrery via the north door and proceed up the hallway
Your scanner warns of a large Saurian beast up ahead in the next room but the animal is actually trapped in the central portion of the room so go ahead and enter
The Saurian is held behind iron posts located between the main pillars of the room
If you look closely there are some levers and pictures in the inside surface of the north and south pillars but access is blocked by the beast
Circle around the cage to the north pillar and pull on the lever
Duck your head around the pillar to see the beast cruelly crushed by the cage bars well at least you didn't have to shoot it in the cage
Move around to the inside of the north pillar and examine the two plaques here the lower one shows a set of open doors
Pull the lever to the right of the upper plaque and a set of doors somewhere off to the north opens
Now move over to the south pillar and examine the plaques the lower one shows the Orrery model
Pull the lever to get that baby swingin'
Just to make sure everything is peachy return to the Orrery via the south door to view the model in action
Note the ceremonial shield shaped hole in the floor in front of you at the base of the model as you enter the room
Return to the dead beastie's room and exit via the east door
Move along the hallway until you come to a wooden platform to your left
Your scanner will tell you that there is another Raptor about Lincoln and a violent one at that
This wood platform actually conceals a passageway below but there is no way of opening it from this end
Continue along the hallway and enter the door at the end you are back in the main mine area one the far side of Lurka's crevice
Nothing to do here so proceed back to the dead beastie's room
Lincoln Assassination Proceed to the north and approach the set of doors you opened remotely earlier
This is an unfinished room with several doors
Once you step into the room a motion detector seals the doors but since you unlocked the double doors behind you they stay open
The now sealed doorway in the northwestern corner of the room actually leads out into that first hallway you arrived in we've almost come full circle
A mirror is propped up in the southwestern corner of the room
You need to move it to light a patch on the eastern wall but the mirror is booby trapped with poisoned gas
Move the mirror and quickly leave the room retreating to the beastie's lair for a few minutes to let the gas dissipate
Go back to the room and check out the wall panel the mirror is now directing sunlight to on the eastern wall
The panel is locked but can be easily opened with the key you got from inside the granite block
Inside you find a shield which will be useful back at the Orrery
Head over to the door in the northwestern corner and try to step through instead you find yourself falling through the floor into an underground passageway
The decidedly unfriendly Lincoln is up ahead
Before moving hit the space bar to toggle into shooting mode you'll get a set of cross hairs on the screen fire with the left mouse button
Move along the passage Lincoln will appear to the right down a branch tunnel with his back to you
One shot in the back how honourable will bring him down he will turn and fire if he notices you
Approach Lincoln's body and pick up the extra ammunition lying on the ground here
Proceed along the passage past Lincoln's body until you come to a T intersection
If you look to the left you'll see some coloured material on the ground this is the last part of the Bapistry tapestry
Pick it up and look for a narrow dark passageway leading off the main one very close to where the tapestry lay on the ground
Follow this narrow passage until you spot several objects on the ground
One is an elephant gun that you may need later with only one bullet though
The other object is a locked chest use the well key to open the chest and retrieve the amulet with Oisin's name marked on it
Continue to follow the narrow passage until it ends you are now back in the main passage
Going left you will soon be back in the location where you picked up the tapestry you'll see passages leaving to the left and right
This time keep going straight until you spot another passage leading off to the left
You can duck your head down this passage but it ends in a chasm that cannot be crossed
Return to the main passageway and go left
You will soon come to some shoring on the wall and a rope hanging from the ceiling
Pull the rope to lower a ramp that takes you out of this area
You are back in one of the hallways above remember that wooden platform you couldn't get by before
That was the ramp
Turning right and travelling west will return you to the beastie's room and heading south from there will take you to the Orrery
Head out of the Orrery to the east and re enter the Bapistry
Proceed into the back of the room up the stairs and place the last piece of the tapestry on the fourth frame
Now return to the ground level and look into the crystal block on the font to view a message from Baphomet the quot bearded face of god quot
He gives you some clap trap about a quot holy thief quot and afterwards a door opens in the southeastern corner of the room
The door reveals a small alcove containing another Shield the same one you found previously
Return to the Orrery grab one of the Shield 's from your inventory and place it in the hole near the base of the model by the north door
The screens blocking doorways to the south and west are removed although the door to the west is still locked
Be sure to grab the pages located in the south side of the model where a new shield shaped hole has been uncovered
Goin' To the Chapel Open the door to the south and exit the Orrery
You step into a corridor with a door at the other end this door is blocked and two different pages on the floor here
There are side passages off to the left but both corridors lead to yet another north south hallway
In the second hallway the north door is also blocked but the south door leads to the chapel
Proceed into the chapel and head directly to the altar straight ahead
Your scanner detects lots of gears and levers behind the altar but no way to access them
There is a door located to the left of the altar in the southeastern corner of the room but it is blocked
Now check out the pianola located in the southwestern corner
A note on the keyboard is from Cobweb a secret ally
who has been leaving the diary pages for you to find and suggests that you check the confessional
You can try and play the keyboard but the pianola is missing its roll
Head over to the confessional booth in the northeastern corner of the room open the curtain and click on the keyhole
We watch a lengthy movie of Lurka speaking with Tobias the head knight
Tobias is incensed that Cobweb has stolen pages from his diary and left them about Aeternis
Cobweb is apparently trying to sabotage this quot test quot that we spoke to Lurka about earlier
The door along the eastern wall is locked so move over to the western wall and proceed through the door here
This leads into another short hallway
Your scanner should warn you that there is a human present in the next room the Vestry
Go ahead and enter Philip the knight has been waiting to speak to you through a grill off to the right
Philip has no love of the grail and wants you to take it away from Aeternis
He does not care for Tobias and tells us that Edgar is the only other knight that we can trust we must mention a chest to Edgar when we see him
Philip departs and we cannot follow him as the grill is locked
Turn back to the west and go through the next door into a short hallway
The room ahead is the Cloisters and contains an entrance to a drain as well as a mouse
Walk around to the far side of the drain and go down the ladder
Unfortunately you have a nasty surprise waiting for you at the bottom
Tallum an oversized knight with a bone to pick with thieves is waiting for you
You may be able to ask a few questions but he comes after you eventually
Your only way of defeating him is to grab the elephant gun switch over to shooting mode and shoot Tallum before he chops you
In the Liberry However all is not lost if he gets you
Tobias saves your hide in time and you wake up in Tobias' library
Feel free to ask him some questions but don't ask about the elephant gun that he is holding in his hands he will shoot you by mistake
Eventually Tobias rushed away leaving you free to search the Library
Meanwhile if you managed to off Tallum step over him and open the grate that blocks the sewer drain
Travel straight north along this drain until you reach the end of the hall where a ladder leads upward
Travel up the ladder into the Library's outer room
Open the double doors and walk into the Library
Begin by going to the centre of the room and click on one of the listening tubes to hear Tobias discussing hiding a quot roll quot with Lurka could this be the pianola roll
The object will be placed somewhere beyond the Docks area
Tobias doesn't seem to think much of the thieves who have arrived thus far
Move over to the west side of the room and pick up the diary pages located here note the latest one
Have a look at the vision book over on the east side of the room and be sure to pick up the key underneath
Finally proceed to the north side of the room pick up the page lying in the corner and open the curtains located here
The curtain reveals some sort of viewer click on the eyepiece to view a big beast from above make sure you are standing right in front of the viewer to make it work
Walk around the viewer and click on the centre mirror hanging above to change its position and return to the viewer
This new view shows another big beast in what looks like a large church or throne room
Return to the mirror click on it twice to move it to a third position and go back to the viewer
The third view shows a knight walking along what appears to be a giant plant stalk he moves off to the right and then jumps out of view
The door just west of the curtain is blocked and the small room just right of the curtain contains nothing so proceed out the southern doors of the Library and descend the ladder
You are back in the sewer drains
Move south along the hallway and turn left at another hallway
Follow this hall along until you get to Lurka's bedroom
There is a broken quill located on the floor in here just under the window next to the bed
Pick it up and return to the main drain
Turning south again open up the grate blocking your progress if you haven't already opened it
Pass by the ladder back up to the Cloisters and Tallum's body if you shot him and proceed to the end of the corridor
Dealing With Ed The way west is a dead end so turn east towards an open door
On your right note a shield recessed into the wall unfortunately the grill is locked and the mechanism needs a winch handle for it to open
Continue on to the room there's a human present and step in to meet Edgar
He seems friendly be sure to mention Philip and agree to everything he says this way you'll be able to ask him some questions after you agree to find his chest
He also gets angry and kills you if you don't agree
Once he leaves you are free to look around the Court Room
There are seats located around the room one for each knight
The knight's crests become important later so you may want to jot them down In addition many of the benches of the knights open to reveal items to grab
Edgar's bench contains mouldy cornmeal Philip's bench has a key to take Guy's bench contains a confessional note from Tallum Geffrye's bench has gloves that cannot be taken Malik's bench has a pagan item and Tallum's bench contains an inkwell
The other benches are locked
Docks of the Bay Leave the room and travel along the drains until you reach the ladder to the Cloisters
Go up the ladder and return to the Vestry where you met Philip
Unlock the barred door using Philip'' key from the Court Room and step into the room
There are two pages to be picked up in here one along the floor to the east and one on the western wall bookcase
Open the door to the north enter another short hallway and proceed to the next door ahead
This leads to a short spiral staircase
Descend the stairs the first door is blocked and exit using the bottom door
You hear a beastie roar and the sound of gunshots probably another Raptor about
Proceed down this new hallway until you come to a locked gate with Tobias' initials on it
Use the library key to open the gate and travel along the hall until it ends
The door here is blocked so go up the ladder to the Docks
Note the warning on your scanner there is a biggie beastie in the water here but its not going to jump out at you hellip yet
Note the ships off to the north and the large stone bridge to the northwest
Walk towards the stone bridge note the hallway leading off to the left and located the lever attached to the wall just before the bridge
Pull the lever and listen to something shifting and grinding
Now return to the hallway and go west
Your scanner indicates there is a Raptor and a beastie in the next room
Open the door and walk in Kurt will address you from the window in the far wall
Use one of the first two answers for him the third will get you shot
After he replies a Saurian comes up behind him you can either warn him you can ask questions afterward or let the beast kill him
Make sure that you give him some of your own information at the end of the conversation or he will shoot you for lying
After either Kurt or the beastie leaves unlatch and unlock the door in the far wall and enter the next room
Go to the box in the northeastern corner and open it to reveal another page
Leave via the western door and travel along the hallway until you reach another door another beastie screams loudly as you travel down the hall
You enter another stairway go up to the very top to see why the Saurian screamed
Now return to the middle doorway and exit the stairway
The next hall takes you to another door with a hot steamy watery room behind
Unlatch the door and then open it to reveal hellip the old wooden walkway room
Proceed directly to the main min area to see that the big double doors are now open this is what that lever at the docks did
The Shipping News With the doors open you can now drive the mine car to the deserted ship
Go over to the car walk in and close the side doors using the right lever
Now pull the central lever to start your journey through the tunnel and over the stone bridge to the ship
Once the car stops open the side doors and get out to the north
Walk up the plank onto the ship's deck
Make your way over to the southeastern corner of the deck where you'll see a body hanging from the mast approach the body look out for the hole in the deck
to initiate a conversation
The man was a member of the unsuccessful assassins of the Prieure the Templars' treacherous sister order sent to kill the Guardians
You have the opportunity to ask him questions until he grows tired of you and tells you to get lost
Pick up the page on the deck here and proceed up the wooden ramp to the top of the ship where the ship's manifest can be retrieved in the northeastern corner of the upper deck
Return to the main deck and enter the ship via the door to the north
The hall bends to the right and descends via a ramp
A door to the south leads to the ship's hold
Inside you will find a large chest conveniently under the hole in the deck above a smaller box and a barrel
Pick up the bottle of Aqua Fortis located on the floor between the hold's items and step up on the smaller box to grab a lever from the top of the barrel
Return to the main deck of the ship and approach the control until to the east this controls the ship's crane which is currently situated directly above the hole in the deck
Pull the right lever to lower the crane into the hold and then pull it again to raise it the chest will be in the grips of the crane
Pull the left lever to move the crane over to the mine car and pull the right lever to lower the chest to the car
Finally pull the right lever once more to lift the claws away from the chest
Return to the mine car get in and close the side doors with the right lever
Now pull the left lever to close the car's claws onto the chest
Pull the central lever to return oops its been damaged
Pour some Aqua Fortis on the lever to get it working again and pull the lever to return to the main mine area
Your buddy Edgar is waiting for you at the crusher saw control panel when you return
He's actually a crazed animal just waiting to slice and dice you
Get out of the mine car and leave the mine area via the northeastern door without following his instructions
Return to the docks area by going through the north door of the wooden walkway room down the stairs and through the two rooms where you met Kurt the Raptor
On the Waterfront Your next task is to get by the great beastie that is swimming around the docks area
There are a number of ways to temporarily dissuade the monster from attacking you but there is one way of permanently banishing the beastie from the docks area
Back at the docks area move to the north under the stone bridge and go down the ladder into the drain found here
You will find yourself on a narrow ledge don't move around or you will fall in the water and drown
You see a large metal gate off to your right with a wheel valve beside it
Click on the door to open the gate the area immediately below fills with water
Once your scanner picks up that the beastie is below you will see its tentacles sticking out of the water click on the valve to shoot some hot water on the beast
It will leave the area forever
Return to the surface and travel south past the bridge and the other ladder
Enter the passage in the south wall and proceed into the tunnel
The plaque on the wall above the tunnel shows another way of getting rid of the beast by resetting the water connections in the room off of the main mine area and using the hose found in the boat
Travel along the dock to the boat get in and pull the lever to the south this sets the boat in motion to the east
The boat eventually stops at another dock to the south
Get out of the boat and walk along the dock up the ramp and off to the east to the large door in the wall
The other ways of ridding yourself of the nasty beast in the water include the following All Mixed Up Open the door and enter the hallway ahead
Your scanner tells you that a Laboratory is ahead along with a live person and a corpse
Enter the room and speak to Philip he is more than willing to answer all of your various questions
Once Philip leaves the room pick up all of the items on the table in front of you including a flask bottles and a book
As Philip may have mentioned the corpse is covered with a hearty poison that will degrade your health bar if you get too close
The mixture that will neutralize the poison in order for you to grab the corpse's key ring is found in the book Decoction of Moon Earth's Blood and Aqua Fortis
To make up the mixture turn around and face the chemical mixing machine behind you to the south
Place the flask on the flask holder below the mixer and then add each of the three ingredients in order to the mixer
If you mess things up grab the flask and empty it into the sink to your left
Don't use the Red Salt for anything the mixture will explode and hurt you badly
Once your mixture is complete grab the flask and click on the corpse's keys to neutralize that part of the corpse
Take the keys and use them to open the door to the west
Before you leave peek behind the chemical mixer hey there's a shield back here but its covered in crud
Apply some Aqua Fortis to the shield to get it sparkling new and put it into your inventory
The Trouble with Edgar Proceed through the west door of the lab and down the hallway
Your scanner reveals that another live body is in the next corridor
Peek your head around to see Edgar waiting for you
Good news he's forgotten all about that chest you were supposed to get for him
Bad news he's aligned himself with another Raptor named Warren and is ready to do some chopping on your head
You wake up inside a gibbet in the Torture Room but with a friendly face in front of you
The mysterious man seems to want to help you but is chased away by Lurka who comes into the room
Speak to Lurka once he leaves the stranger comes back in
Be honest with the man and don't try to cut any deals with him and he will let you out of the gibbet
Follow Jack to his hideout down the hall and ask lots of questions until he decides to sleep
Leave Jack's home via the door and go straight to return to the Torture Room
There's another Raptor in the other gibbet but he or she is dead
Return to the hallway outside the door Lurka came through is locked and take the passageway going north
Eventually you will find another hallway going west take this route to the other portion of Lurka's room
You will find some wax the pianola roll and a plaque with three crests on Lurka's desk in here
Return to the north south hallway and continue to travel north
This hallway ends in a T intersection
The way to the east is blocked
Heading west you come to another T intersection
The hallway to the north ends at a blocked door
A passage open to the east here leads back to the Laboratory
Returning to the T intersection proceed to the south
The door at the end of this hallway is also blocked but follow another passageway going off to the west
The door at the end of this hallway leads out into a spiral staircase
The door at the bottom is blocked so go up the stairs and exit the door at the top
This next hallway ends at a latched door
Unlatch the door and enter the Chapel again you enter from the east wall of the Chapel
More Trouble with Tallum What's that big lumpy shape praying by the altar
Tallum
Didn't we shoot him with the elephant gun
It doesn't matter
Travel to the northeastern corner of the room and look into the keyhole in the confessional booth
We see Tobias pretending to be Baphomet probably for the local yokels
He doesn't seem too trustworthy does he
Walk around the outside wall of the Chapel to the pianola in the southwestern corner so as to not disturb Tallum
Place the pianola roll in the recessed area on the north side of the pianola we get a pre recorded message from Tobias congratulating us on our progress but warning that it will get even more difficult to get the grail
Have a look at the altar now from afar of course it has split open obviously revealing a new passageway
Unfortunately we've got to engage Tallum in conversation to get rid of him
Make sure you save your game and approach him to get his attention
There is a way that you can calm him down and convince him to leave use the following conversation choices Paranoid No Offence Sir Guy Corinth Guard the Grail Time to Go don't ask him any other questions at the end he flies off the handle at a moment's notice
If Tallum does come after you be ready to back away as fast as you can and leave the Chapel to the north believe it or not he will be gone by the time you get back
Return to the Orrery and place the Shield in the hole in the floor to the south of the model
Something moves to the south
Now return to the Chapel the bars blocking the new passageway behind the altar have been removed
For you completists out there you can go back to the hallway outside of the Throne Room to retrieve the other copy of Shield using the ship's lever to winch the grill open and then return to the Chapel
Move to the altar and drop through the new opening
Down the Drain You drop into a northwest southeast running drain with a booming sound coming from the north
Take a guess as to what 's making that noise
The way to the southeast is blocked by a door with water behind it so proceed to the northwest to the big stone wheel
The wheel is lying up against the wall with a rope pinned underneath neither the rope nor the wheel can be moved
There is also a ladder leading upward behind the wheel
Continue along the hall towards the opening to the northwest but keep a close watch on the floor there's a patch of oil here that will whisk you out into the gain silo beyond complete with giant beastie
You can trace the extent of the oil slick with your mouse
Keep to the extreme left of the hallway to proceed farther
Your goal here is to grab the pin lying on the ground near the end of the hall
Once you grab the pin go back to the ladder and proceed up
You enter a room with a table in the centre and some ropes and pullies along the southwestern wall
First grab the bag of flour lying on the floor along the southwestern wall
Now find the rusted lever panel on the same wall just up and to the left of the flour
Take the pin from the hallway below and attach it to the panel
Now pull the pin to winch up the rope
Go back down the ladder and examine the stone wheel our meddling upstairs has managed to push the wheel to an upright position
Give the wheel a tap to start it rolling down the hall
The wheel heads out the end of the hallway and evidently does some damage below
Proceed back down the hallway to the northwest and jump off the end down to the floor of the grain silo
The wheel has done a number on the beast living in here
Have a look around but there isn't much down here except for a dead Saurian
Proceed over to the winch elevator lift and examine the shards of the beasts egg
The lever on the wall just above the egg shell is used to return the lift to this bottom level useful if you fall down here again
C is for Cookie Get in the lift and press on the interior handle to go upwards
The lift arrives at a catwalk level
Climb out of the lift onto the stone walkway but be careful while doing so or you will fall back down into the silo
Proceed straight northeast and go through the open doorway and up the long ramp
The room ahead appears to be a kitchen
Enter the room and take a close look at the kitchen's oven located on your left as you walk into the room
The oven door opens but the tray inside is locked in place
Walk along the side of the oven to the northwest and pull the lever found here to unlock the tray
Return to the tray it displays biscuit moulds in the shapes of the knight's crests
We do have some flour but which of the biscuits should we make
Anything in your inventory with knights' crests on it
Try the plaque you found in Lurka's quot office quot with the pianola roll and the wax
You should be able to find the three crests on the tray that match those on the plaque in the back row it's the third and the fifth from the left and in the front row it's the fourth from the left
These three crests correspond to Tallum spear in shield Tobias feathered crown and Malik Lion
Place flour on all three of the crests you can also use wax although there are limited amounts of each
Close the lid of the tray to press the wafers into shape and then open it again
Put the three wafers into your inventory for later use
Move off to the northwest again and approach the dumbwaiter on the west wall of the room
Climb in and pull on one of the ropes to raise the contraption
The dumbwaiter stops moving and you enter an abattoir a slaughtering room complete with hanging mystery meat
There isn't much to see in here and the door to the south is locked so climb back into your personal elevator and pull on the other rope to return to the kitchen
Veg o matic Open the door to the northeast and enter a sickly green looking corridor that sounds alive
Very creepy
Proceed up the corridor until your scanner kicks into gear you are inside a giant cavern almost completely filled with an oak like vegetation
You may want to have a quick look at the map here we have entered the area near the top left note that the room with the flour and the table connects to the vegetation cavern in the bottom part of the map
We will move towards the cavern's two other exits
Proceed along the corridor past the first intersection and continue up to the cavern in the centre this holds the main truck of the plant
Don't bother going this way though you almost certainly be killed by the vegetation or the scorpions
Backtrack to the last intersection and head to the north
Follow this corridor and go straight through the first intersection you see
Keep going until your scanner indicates you are coming to the next room
The room up ahead contains fewer plants but these are a little more dangerous
Enter the room does it look familiar
This room was the setting for one of the viewings we witnessed in the Library
Do you remember where to go
Proceed along the central path until you get to the second pink coloured plant to your right
Be careful if you go off the path you are plant fodder
Just as the knight did walk to the southwest on top of the pink plant and walk off the far edge you will land on another stem
Walk straight forward southwest to the green coloured plant with the blue and red coloured spikes and click on it to reveal a secret hiding place
Pick up the sword hilt and the set of notes found here
These documents include some notes about Cobweb and Spider some of Tobias' diary entries and a picture of a statue
Turn around walk to the northeast back onto the pink plant return to the main path and leave the room
Return to the last intersection and head off to the north northeast
Follow this path until it exits the veggie cavern via a narrow bridge
Tickety Tock The Killer Clock The next area seems to resemble a giant clock
Get off of the bridge and walk northeast to the door in the stone wall
Enter the empty chamber beyond
The way forward is blocked with a number of hanging pendulums wrapped with poisonous barbs
Walk to the southwestern corner of the room and pull the lever on the wall to start the first pendulum
Now walk to the entrance to Pendulum Alley
This is a great place to save your game
The first pendulum seems fairly easy to get by just wait for the pendulum to swing by and then rush through to the other side hit Shift arrow to run
Pull the lever on the wall here to get the second pendulum swinging like the first
There's a problem though if you rush across to the other side you will discover that the next lever does not activate the third pendulum
Instead of zipping past the second pendulum wait for it to swing to the left and then run to the right northeast at the end of this corridor you will find an alcove to the right southeast that contains the lever which will activate the third pendulum
Now turn around you should see a short cut passage to the northwest
Take it and wait for the third pendulum to swing away from you now run like the dickens back to the centre of the clock
Unfortunately there's something down the other side of the third pendulum that you need to pick up
Wait for the pendulum to swing to the left northeast and take off to the right southwest
You will find a shoulder piece located in a small alcove to the northwest
Once you grab it return to the centre of the clock
Pull the lever here to activate the fourth pendulum and race past it into the empty room beyond
Zmoking the Ziggurat Leave the room via the door in the northwestern wall
Enter the hallway and open the door at the far end
You enter a large room containing a hollow tower dating back to the Byzantine ages a Ziggurat
Feel free to go look to the left and right of the big ramp in front of you but there isn't anything there
Proceed up the long ramp until you get to the doorway into the tower
The route to your right northeast is a dead end
The stairs to your southwest lead up to a small alcove containing the outline of a shield embedded in the wall
There's not much to do here yet so return to the entrance to the tower
Enter the tower room walk towards the door but take the path to the left northwest we'll save the door and what's behind it for later
Follow the path but be careful it turns into a very narrow ledge that hugs the side of the cavern wall until reaching its end at an open doorway to the south
Go through the doorway and proceed down the hall until the next room is reached
Open the door and go in welcome to Geffrye's studio
The Architect of Aeternis is over on the west side of the room so walk over and approach him to start a conversation
Geffrye is a friendly chap he will answer most of your questions
After finishing with him pick up the book on the table to the southeast it's a travelogue of Geffrye and Malik's adventures in the depths of their new home
Afterwards approach the door in the southeast corner of the room open it and march down the hallway
The double doors lead back out into the large grain silo
Walk back over to the elevator lift its over to your right get in careful
and click on the winch to take you up to the next floor
Vincent's Torment Once the lift stops get out to the southwest and follow the hallway to the door with the face built into it
The plaque read some message from Jacque de Molay
Once you get close the spectre of Vincent a long dead knight appears begging you to help him end his torment
Choose the option that asks Vincent how to get through the door he explains that biscuits with the crests of the three most senior knights can be fed to the mouth on the door to gain entrance
You now have the option of asking him a bunch of questions conversation choice or letting him tell the story of his murder choice
Since the questions are the same stupid ones you ask everyone take the second option and learn why and how Vincent was brutally murdered
After you can tell him about the note that Tallum left in his locker in the Court Room and let him rest for eternally or you can try to lie to him and watch him disappear in a huff
He also may tell you about the second way of opening the door behind him by using the quot shoulder piece quot that you found inside the big clock you don't want to do this though because you need it to solve another puzzle later
Either way take the three biscuits out of your inventory and feed them to the mouth on the door
The door opens walk in and approach the door on the far wall
Clicking on it sets off a message from Tobias and causes an ornate key to stick out of the wall
When you grab the key Geffrye appears behind you
He tells you that he has hidden the Third Shield in the Abattoir he was worried about it disappearing and suggests you go and get it as soon as possible
After Geffrye leaves return to the lift get in careful
and click on the winch to return to the second level
Go back to the double doors on the northwest side of the silo and return to Geffrye's studio
Now go to the door facing east open it walk along the hallway and unlatch open the door to the Abattoir
Move to the right towards the east wall and click on the carcass hanging closest to the east side of the room it will open to reveal the shield
Place it in inventory leave the Abattoir and return to the Studio
Return into the Ziggurat via the door to the north and creep along the narrow ledge until you are back within the tower room
Follow the wooden walkway to the southeast and go back up the staircase on the outside of the tower to the southwest to the shield alcove
Place the Shield on the shield outline on the wall and the alcove will shift around
Pick up the shield again and leave the alcove to the west
Turn to the north walk to the end of the hallway and open the door to the east you are back in the beastie's lair
Supermodels Proceed south to the Orrery and place the Shield in the hole on the west side of the model
The door behind you to the west is now unlocked open it and walk into a small chamber
Go up to the triangular doors and click to open them
Move into the small sided room with maps of different Aeternis areas on the walls
Face the wall to the south take out the ornate key from Vincent's room and stick it into the hole in the centre of the crest
Six models of Aeternis areas appear on the floor in the room
As Tobias said you now have a God's eye view of Aeternis
Be careful of the three models closest to the room's exit the grain silo to the northeast the Aqueduct east you haven't been here yet and the Ziggurat southeast
These models should not be touched clicking on them fills the models with water thereby filling the actual rooms with water as well
Do however pick up and read the note from Cobweb that is inside the Aqueduct model to the east
The models to the southwest the Cathedral Vestry west the Waterwheel and northwest the Chimney are a little friendlier
There are orange coloured doors somewhere on each of these models that you should click on to unlock the real doors at these locations
The Vestry and Waterwheel models each have one locked door to unlock while the Chimney has doors to unlock
When finished walk east out of the sided room to the shield outline on the wall and click on it the alcove spins and you find yourself back at the shield outline alcove on the outside wall of the Ziggurat
Walk down the stairs enter the tower room and go straight to the door we skipped earlier
Open the door and proceed along the hallway ahead the hall ends at a T intersection
The way west is blocked by a inaccessible door so proceed to the east
Soothing the Savage Beast Make your way along the corridor to the east you'll pass by an intersecting corridor to the south and walk up to the doorway
Your scanner will tell you several things the room ahead is the Cathedral there's a large beastie in here and you've got a distress signal from Colin the Raptor he was the one who sent the letter to you telling you to come to Aeternis
Open the door and take a peek inside you should see a very large Saurian walking about remember the viewing from the Library
Note the layout of the room there is a smaller walled room the Vestry completely inside the Cathedral
You want to make a run for the door to the Vestry and get inside before the Saurian eats you
You know from before that these beasts can be pretty slow so this can be done fairly easily
The location of the door is pictured below
You must run a bit to the left and then find the door in the wall of the Vestry
Once you find the door open it and go in
Walk to the southwestern corner of the room and spot the chain hanging on the wall left of the organ
Unlatch the pin at the bottom end of the chain hellip and listen as all of the organ pipes fall into the outer chamber the Saurian doesn't sound too happy about it either
Now walk back to the northeast and enter the door on the east wall to the other part of the vestry
Turn to your left and pick up the page on the table
Now click on the box to open it and take the medallion key inside the box
But wait click on the box a second time to open a false bottom and pick up the brooch as well
Before you return to the outer Cathedral note the staircase leading down to the south in here
Return to the main Vestry room and go out the north door
Once you are back in the Cathedral go east and then south the beast has been trapped between a large hole in the floor in the southeastern part of this room and the large organ pipes that have fallen to the floor behind it
Carefully take a look into the hole it appears that there is another room down there
There is a large mosaic on the floor of the Cathedral at its eastern end click to view it
Hmm maybe there is something to this holy thief business as the people reaching for the grail in the picture look like Raptors
Note the set of crests along the east wall of the room
Finally look at the stained glass picture of a group of Templars enjoying some biscuits Malik Tobias Jacques de Molay and a knight whose name is obscured although comparing the crests indicates that this is Tallum
This picture is obviously a further clue for the door mouth puzzle that you already solved
Now walk all the way around the Vestry to the southwestern corner of the Cathedral where the organ pipes lay on the ground
There is a brass lever lying up against the first pipe here quite close to the Vestry wall
Grab this lever go back to the door in the west wall of the room and leave the Cathedral
Odde Claude Walk up the corridor and when you get to the intersecting corridor going south take it
Walk to the door and enter another spiral staircase
Open the door at the bottom and walk down the hall to the next door
The next room is the Crypt open the door and come in
If you look up you should be able to see the head of the Saurian looking around you'll certainly be able to hear it
The blocked doors here in the north and south walls actually lead to inaccessible burial chambers
Have a look at the stone coffin on the floor closest to you the plaque reads quot Claude quot the knight that Malik's experiments were conducted on
Look into the crack to see the hideous beast that they created
The coffin is locked and thank goodness
The other coffin is uninteresting so walk to the southeastern corner of the room there is a narrow corridor you can walk along that will take you behind the bars along the eastern wall of the room
Once you get to the northeastern corner of the room turn around and watch the beast who can finally see you from its perch above
Unfortunately it very slowly topples into the Crypt and crushes its head below
Carefully watch Claude's coffin area the beast's tail knocks the lid off the coffin and the Claude creature is let loose
Don't worry though it sort of staggers around a bit and then disappears into the wall
If you want go check out the dead beast and Claude's now empty coffin but return to the northeastern corner of the room and look up at the statue against the east wall
Does it look familiar
It should you have a picture of it in the Flytrap papers you got hidden inside the plant
The statue in the picture has four items that are not present now a knife a hilt for the knight's sword a ring and a shoulder piece
You already have the hilt and the shoulder piece so place them on the statue in their proper positions
Keep an eye out for the ring and the knife as you progress through the game
Open the door to the north here and walk along the corridor to the bottom if a staircase with pictures on the walls
There will be a door about half way up but continue all the way up to the top
Open the gate here with the medallion key and walk out onto the balcony
Read through the book on the lectern for a summary of Tobias' thief vision
Return to the stairs and now open the door half way up
Follow the golden corridor and unlatch open the door that leads out into the cathedral again
Spin The Wheel Return to the Vestry and go through the door to the east
Note the locked lever on the floor to the northeast
Attach the brass lever to gain more leverage and click still jammed
Descend the stairs to the south and follow this hallway along until you reach a water wheel room
The lever to the left stops and starts the wheel
Click to stop it so that the edge between two of the flat sides of the wheel sits right at the top of the wheel when stopped
Walk out on the wood walkway get onto the wheel and climb down to the wooden platform in the southeastern corner of this room
Exit though the door and walk over to the eastern wall of this oddly shaped room
The door to the north here is locked and a strange looking barrier with a familiar symbol in its centre is found to the south
The symbol matches that on the brooch so grab the brooch and click on the barrier to send it flying backwards into the water to the south
Proceed down this corridor and scan the door to your left a chamber of unknown use filled with poisoned gas
Instead of opening the whole door just click on the panel on the bottom part of the door the heavier than air gas will run out and into the grate on the floor here
Once your scanner says it's safe to go in open the door and do so
Inside you will find a round room with a locked door to the east a ramp leaving to the south and a mummified body to the north
Walk up to the body and have a close look at its left hand that's his left not your left
Grab the ring on his finger and proceed up the ramp to the south
At the top you find an odd room with ramps running up either side to the south
Go up to the top of the ramps and examine the symbol at the top its got the grail in there but the mechanism behind it is locked
Return to the round room exit to the hallway climb back up the water wheel and walk back up to the Vestry
Now try pulling on the brass lever again something happens this time but a trip out into the main part of the Cathedral reveals nothing new
Evidently the moving water wheel jammed the lever from working but perhaps the wheel has to be turned on again to make the mechanism work wherever it is
Walk back down the staircase to the water wheel turn it back on and return to the surface
Now walk out into the main Cathedral room to the eastern wall the crests have been removed to reveal a shiny symbol and a stone triangle
Coolin' with Colin Walk up to the stone triangle and click on it to shift it towards you
Move around to the back of the triangle to reveal a narrow passageway leading west under the stone
Proceed down this twisty passage to a staircase go to the bottom and enter a similar hallway
This hall ends at a round decorative room your scanner should indicate that Colin's helmet is in here he is actually dead and that there is a Saurian present as well
Peek in the beastie is asleep on the right side of the room and the only other exit leads to the south
You can either wake the beast up and then blast it with your gun or just walk along the opposite left side of the room to the south exit
Once you get there note Colin's very dead body impaled under the grate
Click on the grate to open it but before proceeding through click on the lever on the right side of the doorframe
This activates a piece of metal that will catch the grate when it tries to fall on top of you
Inside this next room find a diary page and the th Shield on the ground here
When you touch the shield the grate comes down fully blocking your retreat and the long dead Colin tries to talk to you
Evidently he doesn't realize he's been cut in two if you want to keep speaking to him and asking him questions don't let him know he's dead
Apparently he wasn't the one that sent the letters that brought all of the other thieves to Aeternis
Decisions Decisions Once Colin zaps out leave the room via the corridor to the southeast
The room ahead has a large stone statue and a human is present
Open the door and walk into the room note the large stone head to your right
Once you get far enough in the mouth of the statue opens and Tobias speaks
He tells you to choose the door to the right and warns that others are trying to sabotage the test you can only trust him
When the message ends and you progress farther into the room Geffrye hails you from the window of the door on the left
He indicates that Tobias is planning to betray you and the test and that he cannot be trusted
Tobias wants to use the grail to become supreme leader of the world
Geffrye can help us get back to the Orrery but we will have to go through Malik's old area which has been sealed for centuries
He will meet us at the exit to Aeternis after we get the grail
When finished Geffrye walks down the corridor behind him leaving you to decide which path to follow
You will definitely want to save here since following either knight will lead you into new different parts of Aeternis when finished you can come back and play the other choice it is possible to win by following either path
Followyng Geffrye hellip
Walk into the corridor after Geffrye and follow it to the west
Geffrye opens a door here and beckons you to enter
Start proceeding down this chute it isn't long before you are sliding uncontrollably down the passageway
You end up in a bright swirling room with no discernible exit and poison gas courtesy of a glowing fungus eating away at your health bar
The trick here is to move to the west wall of the room clicking on the vague outlines of a door in the centre of the wall will expose a doorway clicks should clear the fungus away
Immediately open the doors and go through them
You immediately have a choice of direction go left downstairs or right upstairs
Do not go to the left this leads to a locked door and certain death interestingly the locked door is the same one that you saw in the round room with the mummified corpse
Turn to your right go up the staircase along the hallway and open the door before you
Enter Malik's lab of unspeakable acts
Inside you'll see a table with a piece of meat on it of unknown origin
The door on far side of the room north is locked
There is a small empty alcove along the east wall of the room
Standing by the door you came in through you should see a scorpion tail blocking a narrow hallway to the south
In the southern part of the room some kind of strange creature attached to wires lies dormant surrounded by bookcases
Walk past the creature to the southwest corner of the room and click on the bookcase here the way forward is evidently locked
A central pillar has three levers sticking out of it on its east side
Click on the right lever first this raises the previously dormant creature up via wires
Click on the centre lever and the beast awakens
The left lever frees the creature which promptly runs forward and circles the table in a clockwise direction meaning that it runs past you and around the other side of the table
It will circle the entire table and then eat you so as soon as it passes by you the first time follow the creature around the table and dive into the east wall alcove
The creature will lose you and then bust through the door to the north
Come out of the alcove and go back to the southwestern corner of the room
Click on the bookcase again to open a secret door and pick up the book on the stand
The book lists the followers of Malik
Now pick up the papers hidden under the book
These are Malik's journal entries a window into his developing madness
Exit the room to the north and follow the corridor until it ends you find yourself at an opening overlooking the wall of the Ziggurat
Take a deep breath and walk straight out the opening you will fall onto a ledge on the outside of the Ziggurat wall
Walk along the edge until you reach the opening to the tower room and then proceed up the stairs to the Shield alcove Skip ahead to the section titled quot The Downward Spiral quot
Following Tobias hellip Open the right door and enter the ornate looking hallway
The door behind you closes and locks
Open the door at the end of the corridor to enter a maze room
You begin atop a small platform with the maze below walk to the edge of the platform and look to the northwest that doorway you see in the northwest corner of the maze is your required destination
Jump down and enter the maze
Immediately turn to your right and proceed to the northwest
That crackling sound you hear is the sound of scorpions running around the maze
Take a short jog to the southwest and again turn to your right to continue
Keep going to the northwest until you enter an open area now turn to the south and go straight making your way to the maze's southwestern corner
Run up the wooden staircase and go through the door at the top
The next corridor takes you to a spiral staircase leave via the middle exit follow the next hallway and unlatch open the door at the end
You find yourself back in the flooded grain silo with a human and the water monster present
Proceed inward a few steps and Jack hails you from atop his beastie boat
A number of the paths in here have been damaged Jack is floating over to lend you a hand
All of a sudden the water monster reaches out and grabs Jack for some lunch
Walk across the Saurian's body to the other side of the path
Continue in a southwestern direction past the first intersecting path and turn to the northwest at the next path
Walk northwest to the next intersecting path
Look to the left you will see part of the water monster's body sticking out of the water here
As at the Docks any of several items applied to the water Oisin's amulet Aqua Fortis Inkwell will get rid of the monster
Continue travelling northwest and enter the double doors on the northwestern wall
Proceed through Geffrye's Studio and leave via the north door
Take the narrow ledge back to the tower room and go up the stairs to the shield outline alcove
The Downward Spiral As before click on the shield to bring you back to the sided room with the models
Walk into the centre of the room grab Shield from inventory and place it on the shield outline on the north wall
The room returns to its position just outside the Orrery
Pick up the shield again and go out to the east
Open the door to the Orrery and step through
Now walk over to the east side of the room and step on the stone step that is sticking out of the floor on this side of the planet model
The hole that accepts Shield is uncovered
Place the shield in the hole and the entire model lifts up to reveal a pit with a spiral path leading downward
Grab the note lying near the start of the path
This is a map showing the proper way to leave Aeternis but who left it here and is it a trap
The object here is to navigate along the narrow boards to the bottom of the pit without falling off onto the sharp spikes below
You will probably need a bit of luck to get to the bottom if you do fall hopefully you will land on another board below
Judicious use of your save game function can also be useful
Be sure to grab the knife lying at the beginning of the second board
How do you get down this pit of despair
Keep trying
You can try the following path but I make no guarantees as to your success with it
Carefully make your way along the first boards in succession
Now walk onto the next board that crosses across the centre of the pit
Staring straight down walk along this board until all you can see is the wall ahead
Take two steps backward turn degrees to your left and jump off hopefully you will end up on one of the lower boards below and can walk to the bottom of the pit
If not try jumping off from various points on this board
Once you've successfully arrived at the pit's bottom make your way to the centre of the spikes to the hole in the floor and jump through
You land onto a flat wide surface as your precious lifeblood drains away hellip but wait something has pulled you back from the brink of death
It's the grail resting on a raised pillar in the centre of this big cavern
All Hail the Grail Walk up the ramp and face the grail looking to the east
The pattern design underneath the grail describes the path one must take to get out alive
You are currently standing on the white square in the bottom left part of the diagram
The correct sequence is to go east two nodes northwest one node south two nodes southwest one node east two nodes southwest one node and northwest one node
This takes you to the second white square and freedom
Don't walk off this exact path or the ceiling of the room will come down and crush you
Grab the grail as the floor falls away and begin running along the correct path to the exit Once you get to the final node the square of stone rises up through the roof of the cavern and places you into a small room with a door to the north
Open the door and exit the room
You are suddenly standing on a rock platform rising through a deep cavern
The platform finally stops and you find yourself standing inside the Ziggurat tower room
Open the door to the northwest and enter the hallway to the Cathedral
Its almost time to depart dark Aeternis but before you go finish off the Statue puzzle from the Crypt
Go to the door in the southeastern corner of the Cathedral walk along the golden hallway walk down the staircase proceed along another corridor and enter the Crypt
Place the ring from the mummy and the knife from the spiked pit on the statue and a small shelf will emerge from the left side of the statue
Pick up the papers from the shelf and read them
Evidently Malik Spider and Philip Cobweb were the two spies placed by the Prieure in Aeternis
Return to the Cathedral and approach the door in the north wall
This door has been unlocked by the placement of the th Shield in the Orrery
Enter the door and walk along the hallway into the next labyrinth room
You will spot Tallum standing in the centre of the room waiting for grail thieves
As you begin your descent down the ramp towards him the grisly figure of Claude comes out of a door below and advances on Tallum
They wrestle about and eventually fall into the depths
You are now free to walk through the room to the door on the far east side
Open this door and enter the small chamber beyond
Up or Out Your choice of ending is in part dependent on the path you took through the game
If you followed Geffrye's path he will be waiting for you beyond the next bend
If you instead followed Tobias Geffrye will not be present and thus that ending will not be available to you
Whatever your path there is always a way to win your freedom and end the game alive
There are also some ways to die
Save your game and be sure to try them all
Geffrye's Path Enter the corridor to the east as you come around the bend Geffrye will emerge and encourage you to follow him
He has secured Tobias' grailstone so that he might leave Aeternis with you
After he disappears walk forward until you reach the corridor to the west and follow Geffrye
The next room is a foyer in front of the exit door
Walk towards Geffrye the rumbling sound signals that the corridor has collapsed behind you
All of a sudden Tobias emerges from the south steals the grailstone back and breaks Geffrye's neck
He gives you a mean stare and leaves
Has he conceded defeat
Walk up to Geffrye and listen to his last words before shrivelling up into a year old man
Skip to the quot Blow This Joint quot section
Tobias' Path Proceed down the corridor to the east when you get to another corridor leaving to the northeast take it
Proceed to the next door and enter the Aqueduct area
There is a Saurian beast in a cage immediately to your right
Click on the cage to let the beast out and stay behind the open door of the cage
The beast will eventually take off to the north away from you
It keeps going until it gets caught in the booby trap that was waiting for you
Cross the bridge and approach the dead beastie and the killer statue
Walk into the small alcove to the east and proceed around the statue to continue north
Open the door at the end of the hall and follow the next corridor
The door ahead of you is the way out of Aeternis
Skip to the quot Blow This Joint quot section The Beast is Dead If you've killed the Saurian beast on the Aqueduct by flooding this area of Aeternis from the model room I told you not to do this
you still have a way out
Backtrack all the way back to the Cathedral enter the Vestry and descend the stairs to the water wheel
Stop the wheel and cross it to the room to the southeast
For a laugh go to the small alcove to the left of the north door in this room and open the door from your position in the alcove
The monster from Mailk's Lab comes tearing through and then runs straight into the water to the south
Stupid monster
Proceed into the circular room with the mummified knight and go up the chimney ramp to the south
Go up one of the side ramps and face the crest at the top
Grab the grail and click on the crest to open a trap door below your feet
Move forward and drop into a maze
That sound you hear are scorpions looking to bite you
Head south past the first intersection and turn right west at the next intersection
Now go straight until you come to a door with a grail crest on it
Use the grail to open the door and walk into the exit chamber towards the big door
Blow this Joint Approach the door grab the grail and press on the lower crest to unlock the portal
Your scanner indicates that more than years have passed in the outside world
Open the door with a click and proceed outside
The final movie of the game plays the Prieure descend on you as you step out into the fresh air again
You eventually become a super important knight along with Tobias's brother Cesar
Only the very best of humanity will be saved
Who wrote this game anyway Ayn Rand
Other Endings There are two ways to come to a bad ending for in the game other than dying

THE SKULL PUZZLE There are five vertical poles of skulls left to right that must be correctly placed They must all exactly match the order of the skulls placed on the first three poles to the far left of the screen That is the solution to work for When you are able to remove the upside down skull on the the last sixth post to the right and appropriately place it you have solved the puzzle
When you have been able to remove that bottom skull on the sixth pole you will see the parchment poem at the bottom of the sixth pole Remove it and put it in your inventory
Go back to the House of Song Talk to Cuicani again She tells you the second piece of parchment looks like the earlier one you gave her but she still doesn't understand Examine the two pieces of parchment in your inventory together
The one from the skull puzzle and the one that Turquoise gave you earlier Place them together so that the side with Five Serpent joins the row with Three House
Use the eye icon for a close up to adjust the two pieces making sure that the colored dots in the center match up Use click the hand icon on the black background to move the assembled pieces into your regular inventory bar

Go to Tlachtli pitch and talk to the player in the center of the court He has stopped playing He wants to put you to a test Oh oh This looks like an ancient Aztec form of basketball When the player is finished delivering the rules of the game swing right and go forward once Turn completely around and you will see the ball laying on the court Pick it up Turn and put it through the hoop above you You should be able to do this with ease on the first try
Go back to Cuicani in the House of Song Tell her you saw Queztalcoatl and the Great Star at the Tlachtli pitch You learn from her that Three House and Five Serpent references from the parchment are actually calendar dates
Go to the House of Calendars upstairs and look at the dates for Three House and Five Serpent Come back to Cuicani and tell her what you have seen Three House is Tepeyolloltli the Heart of the Mountain Five Serpent is Chalchiuhtlicue the Goddess of Water
Tlatli's message is the water that comes from the heart of the mountain which is to the west of the spring of Chapultapec
After this there is a movie You spend the night and arrive the next morning in Chapultapec

Aim it carefully and kill the bird Go pick it up Repeat this until you have killed and retrieved both singing birds Its easy Take the birds back and offer them to the guard from your inventory Now you may pass into Three Rabbit's compound
Go forward and you will see servants carrying supplies into a guarded storage building After the movie go forward and talk to the guard
You need to find some jars of poison to store before he will let you enter Go to the right of the entry where there is a green parrot with a bad personality hanging in a cage Don't try to talk to him or feed him Look down and pick up the rightmost pottery jar leaning against the rock Put it in your inventory Show the jar to the guard He says that you need a pass word
Go back over to the parrot and give him the bag of Amaranth you got from Woman Serpent The parrot says topco petacolopto That's the pass word Go back to the guard and give him the correct password He will let you pass into the storage building
Once inside turn right and go forward twice Click on the jars of poison You must break them Look around until you find a stick lying amidst some timbers Break the pottery with the stick only two or three will break After you break the pottery try to leave the building You will encounter that nasty Mountain Head again at the entrance He tries to kill you immediately but Chimalli beans him and tells you to run Unfortunately you aren't quite fast enough and are confronted by Black Flower He tells you that you can either choose to pour poison in the aqueduct and kill all the people or you can drink it yourself and save them Of course you must choose to drink it You are the good guy after all
When you are recovered enough from the poisoning scene run to the aqueduct and jump in There will be a dream sequence You wake up in the home of Quilaztli the old doctor Talk to him Chimalli brought you to Quilaztli The guards are looking for you Quilaztli tells you about Three Rabbit Black Flower and the treacherous priestess Papatzin He wants to prepare enough antidote for all the poison He needs the right herbs first You must go to the Chinampas and find these special herbs
