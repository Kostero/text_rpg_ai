While you are doing this head to the north and west to the Lost King
if you have enough gold stop in Paws and get an Axe
The Lost King asks you to kill a Gelatinous Cube
As this is easier to do than LB's quest for them moment you should do it now
Head east to the dungeon of Montor
Save before entering and try to fight your way down to the rd floor where you may find a cube you may need to enter and exit the cave many times to gain experience and gold so that you can make it all of the way and survive
If necessary head back to Paws or Britain to get armor weapons or spells not recommended unless you are a Wizard as they are too expensive at this point
The Mines of Mt
Drash work just as well as Montour so you can go there and use Moon as a quot base quot if you wish
At the end of this quest you should have reached level and have both the Great Sword and Plate Mail
Go back to the Lost King and he will give you a red gem
Now back to your king's quest
Go back to Britain and buy an aircar and if you can afford it a Reflect Suit Fly northeast to the Land of Danger and Despair
On an island off the coast lies the grave
Enter it and complete the quest
Go back to Britain
You have now completed of the game
For the remainder of the game do a bit of exploring
Just remember to buy food every time it falls below
Every time you see a sign post enter it
That will help out later
Lands of the Feudal Lords Fly to the Castle Rondorin and enter it
He'll tell you to kill a carrion creeper
This can be found on the th or th floor of any dungeon
But first head to the Castle Brataria
The quest here is to find the southern sign post
This should be no problem with the airship
Just fly east to the Lands of the Dark Unknown
It is on the northern coast
Fly back to the castle
Beating the Carrion Crawler will be too difficult at this point so don't
Fly southwest to the Pillars of the Argonauts and enter it you should get a weapon
From here fly south to the pillars of Ozymandias
Continue flying from one to the other with occasional food stops until you get a blaster
You should now have almost full Wisdom as an added bonus
Instead you could've gone to any of the other pillars this one was the closest Flying north and slightly east will take you to Scorpion Hole
If you haven't gotten the reflect suit by now go and get it Before you go however stop off in a town and get ladder ups and ladder downs
Also sell all of the unneeded weapons that you got while getting the blaster and exchange them for hit points with the king
When you enter cast the down spells to take you to level and quickly search for a crawler
When you find and kill one just use the ladder ups to ascend to the surface quickly
Return to the castle and collect the green gem
Congratulations
You are now done
From here on in things will get more difficult
Lands of the Dark Unknown Fly east to the lands of the Dark Unknown and into the gulf where on the east the Black Dragon's castle may be found
Talk to the king and he will tell you to kill the lich
Before you embark on this however fly a hop skip and a jump northeast to the Castle of Olympus
He will tell you to find the Pillar of Ozymandias
You have already done that so just fly back west to it and return quickly
The lich may be found on the th and th levels of a dungeon but unfortunately you are not yet powerful enough to even attempt it
You need experience
You can get a lot of experience by quot rescuing quot the princesses from the castles
Enter the Black Dragon's castle again and kill the jester
Run to the prison and unlock the door if it doesn't unlock restore and try again
Lead the princess outside and she will give you money and experience
Fly east to Stout and buy ladder downs
From there go to Clear Lagoon for the ladder ups
Trade in the remaining money for hit points and fly northwest to The End
Use the magic to descend kill the lich and return to the surface
Fly back to the castle to claim the gem
My
You are so good at this
Space The king will tell you that the princess will help a space ace through time
Fly to Nassau and buy a reflect suit and a shuttle
If you can't afford it save a princess or fight in a dungeon
Make sure that you have gold before you use the space ship as you will not be able to come down otherwise
You'll find yourself in space
Sail carefully into the nearby port
You must pick a ship to take along either one will do
The fat one holds more fuel while the smaller one has more shields
Some helpful tips while in combat Aim high If necessary and you brought at least extra you can stop to refuel at a port a on the map
When you must return home your planet is shown as a towards the center of the map
Remember you must bag enemyships to become an ace
Lands of Danger and Despair Fly southwest to the land of danger and despair
Remember that the king didn't say which princess
The first castle that you will find in that direction is Shamino's
Enter it and get his quest
He tells you to kill a Balron
But before you do this however you must do a few other things Reenter the castle and kill the jester again
Using the key open the cell door and escort the princess outside
She will tell you that there is a time machine to the northwest
You can visit it but you can't use it yet
Fly southwest to the other castle here
The White Dragon will instruct you to find the Tower of Knowledge
No problem
It's east in the lands of Lord British
I'll wait for you here
To kill the Balron just follow the same routine
This time however the target creature is on the th and th levels of the dungeon
Ladder down can be found in the nearby town and ladder up can be found to the west in Dextron
A convenient dungeon to use would be on the island to the east
When you're done there return to Shamino
He'll tell you to take items from his stores
I haven't figure out why Play along anddo that
I don't think anything happens tho
Now are you ready for the final battle
Almost Done
Years Ago No you aren't
Trade all of your money for hit points at this point selling all unnecessary vehicles and equipment
Make sure that you are armed with Reflect Armor and a Blaster NOT a Light Sword
I HIGHLY recommend having no less than hit point before you reach him
Head to the Time Machine and enter it
You will be taken to Mondain's lab where he is making the gem
Attack him constantly from afar
STAY AWAY FROM THE GEM
And while you're at it STAY AWAY FROM THE FIRE THINGYS
When he turns into a bat chase him to the far left
He won't be able to fly east while you are blocking and he will be stuck there
Keep attacking until he falls unconscious
He may get back up just attack him some more
When he doesn't get up run over and get the gem
You will take a lot of damage so be careful
If you don't beat the game right then and there go back and pound Mondain for a while
He'll dieeventually
Congrats
You have beaten the game
And with no help from me Now don't you feel special

General tips Don't kill anyone who is not actively trying to kill you no matter how rude they may be If anyone asks you to run an errand for them do it the reward is almost always worth it Trust the good guys identified by the Banner of Cabrius at their door
They will never steer you wrong Save your game often Talk to people more than once
There are different threads to most of the conversations
Try different responses each time Write down what people tell you
It may not make any sense now but could do so in the future
Other useful stuff When using Fly or Levitate pressing quot E quot makes you go up pressing quot Q quot makes you go down You can make a fishing pole with a Pole and Spider Thread who says there's no such thing as a free lunch
Fresh fish are also great for payoffs and for bartering Make popcorn with corn and a torch

Character Creation Throw away all the characters in the beginning
For each character class there are a number of random skills assigned each time that you create a new character except that they aren't random
Let's say I want to be a fighter
I create a bunch of fighter characters and throw them all away but not after writing down each ones' attributes
Now I quit the game and re start the game
I again create a character
The exact same sequence of characters will appear in the exact same order but now I know exactly which one to keep
Strength is the most important skill of all
Most of the rest can be im proved later via shrine chants but not Strength
Fighters Druids and Tinkers generally have high Strength factors
You will want to have a Strength factor of at least in order to wear plate armor and still be able to carry a fair amount of goodies
Your carry capacity measured in units of quot stones quot is exactly twice your Strength rating
The three primary skills Strength Intel Dexterity are factored in with the other skill ratings
The final value used by the game seems to be proportional to the skill level multiplied by the primary skill level tied to it
These associations are as follows Strength Attack Defense Unarmed Sword Mace Missile Axe Intelligence Mana Casting Lore Dexterity Sneak Swim Search Lockpick Charm Acrobat Traps Repair Appraise For example If you are trying to pick a lock the game uses a number based on your Dexterity TIMES your Lockpick skill
Maximum Vitality and Mana Capacities These seem to depend on several factors
The present theory is as follows Vitality Depends on Strength and Experience level Mana Depends on Intelligence Experience and Mana skill rating The precise equations using these numbers remain a mystery
Fun things to do On Level NW corner accessible only from level there are two hostile mages
Kill one and leave the other alive
Then get out of his way as he will throw fireballs at you
Go find some safe corner in which to hide
The remaining mage will quot summon quot a wide variety of nasties for you to kill hostile lizardmen mountainmen fighters spiders headlesses etc each with its usual assortment of goodies
This gives you the chance to sample battle with all of the various denizons of the abyss as well as cover the floors with loot
Every once in a while you may have to go back to the mage and push him around a bit to keep him sufficiently pissed off
Drink lots of Ale and Port all at once get drunk and pass out
Just remember that you need to save at least bottle of Port for rotworm stew

Hug the walls Level Mine Control Codewith being top position then clockwise Left to Right Level Garamonwants you to throw the quot talismans quot into the quot volcano quot
You CANNOT complete the game unless you have found his bones on level Garamon was the brother of Tyball and one heck of a mage
You will find several runestones one is quot Vas quot and a magic ring by the right bones
The bones must be buried in the grave in the tombs on level quot use quot the bones on the gravestone
After the ghost appears you must answer the questions correctly
Another way to tell if you have the right set of bones is to try to stack them on top of another set of bones in your inventory
Like coins bones will stack leaving one quot bones quot icon with a number next to it to indicate how many are stacked
Garamon's bones will not stack this way
Talismans Taper of SacrificeLevel trade with Zak food Sword of JusticeLevel Blade is in secret room
Lever to operate is be hind a vine covered wall in the extreme SE corner Note you must attempt to quot pick up quot the vines to reveal the secret door just quot looking quot won't work
Level Hilt is in the tombs area accesible from either the Bullfrog area of Level or a secret door on Level
Level Shak will make the repairs for coins
Cup of WonderLevel room where Gazer is that you have to swim to
Stand on the little pedastal in the corner and play your flute
The flute tune is taught by Eyesnack on level
The clues to the three part mantra and use of incense are taught by Fyrgen and Louvnon on level
Standard of HonorLevel from Dorna Ironfist after slaying the Chaos Knight aka Sir Roderick
Ring of HumilityLevel room in NW quadrant with levers
Throw levers in following order NW SE NE SW Stay away from the center of the room when doing this
After last lever is thrown ring will be on the central pedastal
This is told by Derek on level after you give him the Gem cutter you got from Goldthirst on level after you slew the Gazer in the mine

Pieces of wood can be used to improvise a torch just douse it with oil
Spikes are for pinning doors shut
Once a door is spiked only you can open it
You cannot defeat Level without making a few trips down to Level You cannot kill the quot Slasher of Veils quot no matter which side of the moongate you both happen to be on
Even with Attack Defense and Sword ratings of don't ask
You can get him to the quot yellow quot state but not beyond
When you and the demon are sucked through the moongate you must run down one of the three paths red green blue that go off the central area
That is all you can do
The Orb you found on Level tells you which path to take
Maximum skill ratings depend upon the character type selected Example Fighters can only go to in Mana Lore Casting rating while Druids can go to Maximum Mana capacity also depends upon the type of character created
Druids and Mages rate very high
Trick to get past all the Fire Elementals in the Chasm of Fire on level When you come up from the NE part of level you will find a Golem and a Key
There is a secret door leading to the Chasm of Fire
Open the door and familiarize yourself with the route from the door to level and the Chasm
Go back down to level and kill some time while your Mana re charges
When you are up to about Mana points fire up two quot Sanct Flam quot spells and cruise up to level and the Chasm
The Fire Elementals will cease to be a problem
Trick to the prison area of level Kill all of the guards quot medallion I don't need no steenking medallion quot
The head guard has a key which will open all of the low security prison cells and all of the portcullises in the prison area and all of the portcullises in the other guard areas of level
Real handy
The alternative is unpleasant
There are at least magic rings There are at least magic wands Lots of goodies are hidden under bones debris etc
If you see a pile of debris of the variety that you can't pick up look to make sure that every pixel is in its proper place
If not carefully click on the offending pixel
Go swimming in the rivers in the mines of Level
Look carefully at any sewer pipes that you find
he he he don't worry it's not fatal
It is generally a bad idea to kill anyone who is not actively trying to kill you This is for reasons You may have needed to talk to them some more Killing good guys gives you negligible exprience points and in some cases even REDUCES your experience points
There are more than enough hostile critters around to get you max
experience
There are a maximum of experience levels
After the th level that's it
There are a maximum of around experience points
After that the number will not increase
Examples etc
There are secret doors in the tombs of Level
There are secret doors in the Maze of Silas on Level
On levels and there are areas in the extreme NW corner that you cannot get to other than through the door on level
This door cannot be opened until you have defeated Tyball i e
finished all of level and freed the prisoners in the high security cells
Talk to the knights on Level repeatedly
They know lots of mantras you can use to increase your fighting and weapons skills
They do not neccessarily tell you these the first time that you talk to them
Using the Detail setting from the menu can really help if you have a slow machine
Cranking the detail down allows much faster smoother motion
Settings are as follows Very High full detail High no detail on ceilings Medium no detail on ceilings or floors Low no detail on ceilings floors or walls For critical jumps it is very handy to crank the detail to LOW make the jump and then crank it back up
Especially on slow machines
To make Rotworm Stew Get the recipe from the green goblin Lanugo on level
Don't lose that recipe
Assemble the correct ingredients in a bowl Then quot use quot the recipe You will see the icon for the bowl change if succesful There are more bowls ingredients on lower levels Moonstone Once you have the ability to cast a Gate Travel spell via scroll or runestones fire one up
This will teleport you to the moonstone area on Level
There is a secret wall to get out of this area
Pick up the moonstone and put it down where ever you want
Further Gate Travel spells will teleport you to the stone
Tombs on level You need to get the Crystal Splinter from Kallistan in the prison cells
Then leave the prison area through the main gate and head south until you can't go south any more
There is a secret wall not a door that will shatter when you run into it
This will not happen unless you have the Crystal Splinter in your possesion and there is no other way to get into the tombs
There are secret doors in the tombs area
Three of these are located at gravesites that do not have headstones
The other two lead back out into the main areas of level
These two are one way only secret doors
They can be opened only from the tombs area
Silver Sapling When you quot pick up quot the Silver Sapling on level it turns into a seed
Find some quot dirt quot floors and re plant the seed
The Sapling will re grow
This allows you to be re incarnated if you die
Upon death you will find yourself alive once more at the location of the Sapling
The seed needs to be planted only once
Re incarnations seem to be infinite
You can move the Sapling to a more convenient place by picking it up and re planting if you wish
Rawstag will only open the door if you give him a red gem any type condition To free the prisoner Murgo from the Lizardmen give Ssetharee lots of food I used fresh fish that I caught with my fishing pole
Give the giant gold nugget to Goldthirst
He will be really impressed
To raid the Goblin treasuries on Level Grey goblins Throw up a couple of shield spells and just walk in
The guard will immediately attack so be quick
DO NOT counter attack
If you attack any one of the goblins the rest will all come running to his aid and you will be up against at once
Once you have all of the goodies leave the goblins' area
If you return later only the guard will be upset
Green goblins Don't let anyone see you
Push the guard into the next room and quot spike quot the door closed
Then wait until nobody else is looking
Open the door and close it behind you as you will be in the treasure room for a while
Again if attacked DO NOT counter attack
To use incense Wave a torch or candle over the block of incense
If done right the block will change appearance to show that it is lit
Now quot use quot left click the block and you will see a vision
Each vision gives you letters of the letter mantra
Once you have used incense times you will have all letters
The pairs must now be re arranged to get a workable mantra that you can chant at a shrine pairs of letters three positions possible combinations
There is NO TIME LIMIT to complete the game
You can take as long as you want
Weapons come in the following calibers from worst to best Swords dagger short sword long sword broad sword Maces cudgel light mace mace Axes hand axe axe battle axe Missiles sling bow crossbow Shields buckler small shield wooden shield tower shield Armor leather mail plate Weapons Armor etc come in the following grades from worst to best badly worn worn servicable excellent Runestones Numbers indicate the levels upon which they may be found
There may be more than one of the same kind of runestone on a level as for the quot AN quot stone a quot quot by the level number means that you have to get it from someone usually by going off on some weird quest
A means that there are a total of stones all on Level B C D E behind a barrel hard to spot F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W Y Secret doors WARNING Some secret doors especially on level are ONE WAY ONLY
This means that if you are on on the wrong side of the door it will not open or even appear to exist at all
Level Door between Grey goblin area and room with levers pedastals Door by Silver Sapling leads to shrine area Door on north wall of hallway in extreme NW quadrant leads to fountain Level No secret doors Secret wall exposed after using Gate Travel to the Moonstone Level Door along hallway in extreme SE quadrant behind vines leads to fountain Note you must try to quot pick up quot the vines in order to expose the secret door just quot looking quot won't work
Fortunately this is the only place that this is neccessary
Dirty trick IMHO Door in store room of thieves Door at end of hallway by lever in extreme NE quadrant Secret area behind waterfall in NE quadrant swim to it Level doors behind Roderick doors in the Maze of Silas Door in room with skeletons pedastals switches Door behind chest in water area Secret area in SE corner of Bullfrog Maze just jump THROUGH the wall Level Door in tombs area at extreme East Central edge of map Door in extreme NE corner of map leads to Cabrius' tomb Level Door in library Door at end of hourglass shaped room Door in extreme SE corner walk down lava channel Secret area accessed by running through wall in East Central area between the eyes
This place is just east of the stairway down from level

also can get this key from defeating Tyball Skull key from defeating Tyball opens Arial cell and high security prison cells Yellow key from Smonden opens door in extreme NW corner to special area There is no known key to open doors to the quot Evil Undead quot area Level Skull key from Carasso opens door off main hallway in East Central area RINGS Level Ring of Resist Blows obtained by killing one of the Bandits Level Ring of Leap by boulders in South central room Level Ring of Levitate in short hallway off Chasm of Fire Level Rings of Regeneration Mana Regeneration Invisibility Poison Resistance Magic Protection Note of the rings on level are in the small areas you get to from level Unsolved Mysteries These are things that I just never figured out Level There is a lever at the end of a long hallway in the NE qudrant
I never figured out what it does
It doesn't have anything to do with the secret door nearby Somewhere it is written that there is a secret way to Level
I never found it
Level There is a pull chain outside the entrance to the Knights area in the SW quadrant that didn't seem to do anything There is a Grey Lizardman running around who claims that his leader is Iss'leek This is strange because Iss'leek is the leader of the RED Lizardmen Ishtass is the Grey leader
What is this lizardman doing on Level and what do I say to him
BUGS Unfortunately there are several PROBLEM Can't talk to anyone below level This seems to occur only when someone has the Demo of Underworld and then loads the real game into the same directory
Solution backup your quot SAVEx quot files delete everything re install restore quot SAVEx quot files
Inventory corruption
There is a patch available to quot solve quot this problem from Orirgin and available from some FTP sites
It seems to help but not entirely eliminate the problem
There has been some mention that reducing the number of items in a container pack box whatever seems to help
There has also been mention that nesting containers i e
an item in a box in a bag in a pack should be discouraged
Game crashes when entering the NW corner areas accessible only from level
Solution try dropping some items
Take only the barest essentials
Also if trapped in this area you may be able to teleport out using a quot Gate Travel quot spell
Screen very dark
There is a file called quot shades dat quot in the UW directory
Rename it to something else like quot shadez dat quot and delete quot shades dat quot
This should brighten things up a bit
NOTE I have not tried this personally so I can make no guarantees

Ultima III Exodus Solves and HintsCopyright c by The Mines of Moria Because of the structure of the exodus program it fits into the catagory of action adventure
It's not a true arcade game nor is ita true adventure more like a combo
Of both
This prevents us from writing this tutorial in the normal format

Ultima IV Quest of the Avatar SolutionBy Stephen Leesl cornell edu valid until I guess Version JUL Author's Notes I've played Ultima IV before on an Apple and the music on the Mockingboard is great
Too bad the IBM version doesn't have any decent music
I miss it a lot
I've forgotten how good it was
When I replayed this excellent game I couldn't find a solution on the net so I decide to write one myself and here it is
Solution The objective of this game is to gain access to the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom
In order to do that the following goals need to be fulfilled Become parts avatar Have the key of parts Know the word of passage Know the pure axiom Go to the chamber Become parts avatar You just need to do the right things and avoid doing the wrong things sounds easy eh
To know what the 'right' and 'wrong' things are you can meditate at the shrines
Each of the cities represents a virtue and you should ask about in each for the rune and the mantra in order to access the shrines
Note that you'll need to locate the shrine of spirituality and get the Silver Horn to gain access to the shrine of Humility
Visit Hawkwind in Britannia often to know of your progress
Once you are ready for partial avatarhood in a virtue go to the shrine and meditate for cycles
Repeat until you are avatar in all virtues
Getting the key of parts You need to find the coloured stones and use them in the Altar room of Truth Love and Courage to get the parts of the key
The stones are mostly found at the Dungeons except the white and the black stone
The altar rooms are accessible via the th level of the Dungeons
You also need to figure out which stones to use at each altar
Knowing the word of passage Ask the parts of the word in Lycaeum Serpent's Hold and Empath Abbey
Paste together to get word of passage Knowing the pure axiom When you achieve Avatarhood in each virtue a rune would appear on screen
Translate
Paste the alphabets together to get the pure axiom
Going to the chamber The chamber is accessed via the Great Stygian Abyss
So first you need to figure out where the entrance of the Abyss is
Second you'll need to reach it
To do that you need the wheel of H M S
Cape to pass through the pirates
After that you'll need the Book of Truth Candle of Love and Bell of Courage to open the entrance
And while we are at it why not find Mondain's Skull and destroy it at the mouth of the Abyss
And also to survive the Abyss you need the Mystic Armor and Weapons
Then hack through the Abyss and find the chamber at the th level
Oh by the way you need the stones again to go down each level of the Abyss but you should have them already at this time
Once you are in the chamber all you need to do is to answer a few questions correctly of course
and win
Hints Can't find your companions
There is one in every city including Magincia except the one that you come from ie
with the same job as you
Just look hard
The magic wand gp from Buccaneers' Den is the most powerful weapon
The magic bow gp same place follows but need ammunition arrows Both are ranged and thus more useful than the Mystic Weapons
Reverse the mantra of Pride to get the mantra of Humility
Lord British will heal your party if you ask for it
In Magnicia wait for the snake to approach you with P ass and T alk it
Don't run into it because you'll be attacked before you have a chance to ask
Orbs in Dungeons can enhance Str Int and Dex
see table below Telescope in Lycaeum let you see the maps of the cities
see table below The only projectile weapon a shepherd can use is the sling
Hythloth connect to all Altar rooms
Also there is a room in level just go straight down which has a lot of chests money
in it
You can go into the room defeat the Balrons get the money retreat and enter the room again for another loot
You can repeat this until you have enough money or not enough health
The manual lists the energy fields' effects incorrectly mine Tom's did anyway
The correct effects Violet sleepBlue lightningOrange flameGreen poison Spoilers How do I
Choose job Look up the virtue your job corresponds to
When answering the questions of the gypsy at the beginning steer your answer towards that virtue
Advance in level Go talk to Lord British
Decode these locations in the spoiler Get the sextant
Know which stone to use at an altar The short answer is you use the stones that are found in the dungeons connecting to the altar room
Hythloth is white
The long answer is to use the stones that contain the color of the principle blue for truth yellow for love red for courage
Note how they mix to get the other colors
White contains all colors
Black contains none
Know which stone to use in the Abyss See the table for the virtue each stone corresponds to
Get to Cove The intuitive way is to wait for a pirate's ship to appear in Lock Lake which is tedious and need a lot of luck
However a better solution is to get a ship by buying or getting one from pirates and sail into a whirlpool
The ship will reappear in Lock Lake and you can now go to Cove
A second way is to use the blink spell blink west then south from the right place which is even easier
Get around in the Abyss It's very tedious I suggest you just bring a lot of gems
In some rooms you'll need to step on push some tile to open a door make a bridge etc
Some rooms need to be entered twice from different directions
When in doubt map it out
Where can I find My companions see table below
Sextant ask for item 'D' at theive's guild Mandrake Found at D'G quot L'G quot and K'F quot G'E quot when both moons are dark Nightshade Found at J'F quot C'O quot and C'M quot M'N quot when both moons are dark Shrine of Spirituality Enter moongates when both moons are full Runes see chart below Mantras ditto Silver horn Buried on an isle off the tip of Spiritwood K'N quot C'N quot White Stone F'A quot E'A quot on Serpent's Spine reached via Balloon Black Stone Stand where the gate of both moons dark shall appear search when moons goes dark Balloon At exit of Dungeon Hythloth
You may find the X it spell useful for this purpose
Note that the balloon returns there each time you exit from Hythloth Dungeon Hythloth Enter from secret entrance in Britiannia Wheel of HMS Cape In deep waters of the bay in Cape of Heros N'H quot G'A quot Book of Truth A'G quot A'G quot in LycaeumCandle of Love A'B quot B'G quot in Cove Bell of Courage Bottom of a deep well at sea N'A quot L'A quot Skull of Mondain At P'F quot M'F quot on the darkest night Mystic Armors A'E quot B'G quot in Empath AbbeyMystic Weapons A'P quot A'I quot in Serpent Castle What is

If somebody can write a section on going through the Abyss it would be great
Ditto for Weapon and Armor availability and prices
How about a map generating program
I've seen one for the Apple but anyone has an IBM version
For U also If you improve on this file please send me a copy if possible
If anyone has a copy of U U for the Apple or a MockingBoard they want to get rid of try contacting me at the address at the top
Machine Dependent Note If you are still lucky enough to play this game on an Apple with MockingBoard I still remember you can sample the music by pressing maybe too at the title screen
I'm not sure I remember it correctly but that's the idea
It works with Ultima VI on the IBM PC too
Useless information but maybe someone cares The Book of Wisdom has writing on the cover
When translated it reads quot Being a compendium of the processes and effects of combining human will and natural forces as discovered and recorded by the greatest sorcerers since the beginning of time

Ultima V Solve Well in order to solve U you must do the following Obtain all shards from the underworld Use the shards to destroy the Shadowlords Retrieve the Scepter Crown Amulet and Sandlewood Box Become th level Completed all of the shrines quests Be 'Ordained' by Brittish when you sleep Then enter the 'hole' to the center of the world wind your way around up and down levels of course and free Lord Brittish Got it
Didn't think so
Here is a more in depth description of the above Obtain all shards These are found in 'obvious' places in the underworld
I remembered to write down only two of the coordinates sorry I can't tellyou the Third
C and B B are the only two I know
To obtain your coordinate hit lt ctrl gt on a gs or lt ctrl gt lt shift gt on a e
This will spit out a long number
The last digits are your current coordinates
Note is to your upper left as if youwere in the th quadrant of a plane
Use the Shards Go into each of the castles Empath Abbey Serpents Hold and Lyceum and find the flames of Truth Courage Love
You then must position yourself directly below it
Next summon the Shadowlord who is opposite that flame Truth summons Falsehood Love summons Hatred and Courage summons Cowardice To do this shout out their names Falsehood Faulinei Hatred Astaroth Cowardice Nosfentor
THe shadowlord should appear directly above the flame pass a turn so that it walks onto the flame then use the correct shard
It will give you this little song and dance then say doom has been wrought
And the shadowlord is gone forever
Retrieve Lord Brittish's articles The scepter is in Stonegate A or is the reverse
well it is either A or A I'm looking off of my maps and forgot whichway is which
Well you go in there and grab it
NOTE you MUST have the flying carpet by now to get over the traps or you will instantly die upon touching the traps nice huh
The Crown is on the top level of Blackthorns castle behind the magically locked door
THe Amulet is in the underworld lower leftpart of the world approximately D give or take a dozen and finally the sandlewood box is on the top level of Lord Brittish's castle again behind magically locked doors
To get it you must play the following tune on the harpsichord and that will cause a section of the wall to disappear so you can grab the box
Level Well this is quite obvious
You need at least experience to do this Takes quite some time
QuestsYou must go to each shrine it will give you a quest to go to the codex E E where it will tell you some pretty important info
The last time you go there the eigth time you will get some other info
This is the translation Beyond shades egress in the centre of the underworld there is a place of darkness
Beyond this darkness lies the gate to the coreof the world
When thou art ready thou must call forth Veramocor to unlock the gate and venture past ethereal words and stealers of souls
That which the world hath dost awaits thy coming
Once you have completed steps not necessarily in that order Lord Brittish will come to you while you sleep and say something like Thou art now armed and thy must now complete thy destiny
You are then off to
Enter the hole in the underworld and get down to th level
Somewhere on the th level is a room which looks like a room in a town
You must go stand before the mirror
It will suck you in and your done

Ultima VI Spoilers and Hintsby John Houghtoncenobite oak circa ufl edu I have finally finished Ultima VI after having to restart the game times because of some inherent bugs in the program
The bugs caused my game to crash in certain dungeons Lord British to vaporised in the thin air and weird things to happen
The staff from Origin said that the bugs are caused by keeping too many items on each player
It is hard to know what items to keep and what items to discard until I finished the game
At one time I was keeping several hundred items So I am writing this article which I hope will help many of the current Ultima VI players
For this article to be helpful it willinevitably contain some spoilers but I will try not to reveal too much
If you need more specific help please email to me
Some common questions that are asked during the game are What items do I need to keep a Essential Items The only items that you need to complete the game are a loaded vortex cube with moonstones and the vortex lens b Discardable Items A lot ot items can be discarded once they have been used at appropriate places in the game
The problem is to know when you can discard them
Some of the objects are also bulky and you do not need to keep them with you when they are of no use i runes They can be discarded after you have freed each shrine and collected the moonstone ii pieces of maps They can be discarded after you have got the location of the pirate's cave from Homer and after you have figured out the location of the treasure island iii pieces of tablet They can be discarded after Mariah explain to you about the false prophet iv ballon plan This can be thrown away after you have built the hot air ballon v ballon can be discarded after you have been ordained for a quest at the shrine of Singularity
The ballon is very heavy and is a burden to carry along
You can throw away the fan as well vi scroll of gargoyle language can be thrown away after you have use it viii excess weapons can be sold to the weaponsmith for gold pieces You will pick up lots of throwing axes spears cloth armor shields amp helms that you do not need once you equiped yourself with the essential weapons armors
Sell them away whenver you're in town ix general items there are a lot of useless general items in the game e g
yellow rings etc
Most of these items have no cash value and no useful properties
You do not need to carry them around
Who do I recruit as team members in the game
The following are a list of creatures who will join you for your quest Jaana Julia Gwenno Katrina Sherry Blain Cpt Leonna Cpt Leo Sentri Seggallion Gorn Beh Lem
You will need Sherry for a specific task and you will need Beh Lem so that the gargoyles in gargoyle town do not attack you
Dismiss Sherry after the task is done Initially my team comprised of a lot of familiar faces people that were with me during Ultima VI amp V
However I found out that Katrina amp Julia has been downgraded to weaklings in this game
Jaana the druidess has lost her ability to cast spells
So selecting the best of the lot my team comprised of Avatar Dupre Shamino Iolo Seggallion Gwenno Gorn amp Beh Lem
What important items are found in the Dungeons
There are lots of dungeons with levels in this game
You have to explore them thoroughly to have the maximum amount of fun in the game
Usually at the lowest level there will be some important items amp tresures
Be meticulous explore every corner and use every ladder and drop down into every hole in the ground
Do not give up exploring until you have found the appropriate item in each dungeon
I've included to indicate non essential items but do explore them for fun Caves Dungeons a Moonglow Catacombs Rune of Honesty b Bucaneer Cave Minor Treasures c Dungeons Destard Dragon Eggs Major Treasures d Dungeon Wrong Map e Dungeon Shame Map f Dungeon Deceit Minor Treasures g Dungeon Covertous Minor Treasures h Ant Mound Map i Sutex Castle Catacombs Ballon Plans j Lycaceum Underground Certain Books k Cyclops Cave Powder Kegs l Spider Cave Spider Silk m Heftimus Cave Minor items n Heros Cave Minor items o Dungeon below LB Castle Thief Guild Belt p Dungeon Hyaloth Gargoyle scroll q Pirate's Cave Tablet r Tomb of Kings Minor items s Shrine of Control Mondain Statue t Shrine of Passion Minax Statue u Shrine of Diligence Exodus Statue What Spells do I need
There are about spells in this game and you definite do not need most of them
If you buy all the spells you will have items in your spell book and this may cause your game to crash
Here are some of the basic spells that you will need
Dispel Magic cure poison Telekinesis Unlock Magic Dispel Field Pickpocket amp Reveal detect invisible beings
Is stealing pickpocketing killing OK
Stealing Pickpocketing amp Killing will cause you Karma Points
You started out with Karma Points and you need only this much Karma Points to finish the game
Talking to each of the shrines will give you more Karma Points Pickpocketing an item cost you about Karma Points
Stealing cost you point
Killing intelligent lifeforms will cost you Karma points as well e g
killing some of the winged gargoyles in gargoyle town
However some minor stealing may be permitted in this game to build up cash real fast
I know where to get gold nuggets i e
gold pieces at the expense of Karma point
Email me if you really need cash
How do I avoid restarting from scratch when my game crash
Make multiple copies of savegame
as your game progress and youcan always use an older version should your current game get corrupted
OK
I just found out that you quot use quot doors to open them Sounds strange to me but OK if you insist
I really think that the writers of the instructions are assuming that the user has played previous versions or are all the instructions for ULTIMA this poor
The reason the instructions are quot poor quot for Ultima VI is most likely because the controls have been so vastly simplified over previous Ultimas
Ultima III through V seemed more like NetHack with respect to keypresses than any other game
There was an advantage in that you could try more possibilities like yelling things or whatnot but now it's simpler to establish whether or not you're supposed to be able to do something with something
My only real peeve so far has been that it's difficult to catch on that quot dispel magic quot cures poison
Can you have one of the other members in your party quot get quot I find it a waste of time to get for myself a quot move quot to the other members of the party
Oh well I guess part of the game is to figure out the cryptic commands
They aren't cryptic just simplified
You have to go into solo mode by pressing through and have them get the object
Just like the other commands this is described clearly in the reference card
For example quot USE U operates any object that has some function
Among other things it will let you open and close doors and chests enter or exit ships climb ladders milk cows mount horses light or extinguish fires look into telescopes or crystal balls ring bells eat or drink food and beverages and play musical instruments quot reproduced from ref guide w o permission whereas in previous Ultimas the Use command would be represented by five or more different commands for each situation
I haven't found any of the previously reported bugs yet I seem to be able to store many items in my inventory pile
I think that I have version
IBM Any newer versions out there
I have version and have had only minor inventory problems
Lord British has become a variety of nonsensical things as have the members of his court but it could be a lot worse so far
Make backups
Where in Yew can one find wood for panpipes
Also where's a sawmill
You should looking for LOG instead of wood in Yew
The sawmill is in the east of Minoc after you walk through the swamp
How can one check up on one's Karma points
This trick is not documented but posted in this group
To check your Karma hit ALT and
The first two digits are you Karma the next digits tell you the time of the day next is the X coordination and the next is the Y
The finnal digit is the number of world you are in
The problem is that this is a fifth generation message
The original posting says that lt alt gt shows Karma points but it must be typed with the numeric keypad and lt numlock gt on
Where can one get lockpicks
I've been looking all over the place for 'em
A guild in sorry I forgot I believe is on an island
I've been utilizing an invisibility ring to free shrines w o messing with uncooperative gargoyles
Is this a mistake
I don't think this is a mistake later on you will find a lot of invisibility ring
I take it that when one quot Steals quot Karma points are lost
If this is done inadvertently and the item is immediately replaced have I still quot Stolen quot as far as Karma points are concerned
I think you've still stolen
But according to see cs utexas edu's article steal once twice shouldn't affect you Karma too much
Has anyone taken the book Wizard of Oz from the Lycaeum and given it to Lord British If so what is the reward that he gives you
He gives you measly gems
Big deal
I only need one gem
I just save the game before I use it each time and restore the game when I am done
Anyone know how to re order your party without asking people to leave and then join again This doesn't work for say Julia she gets mad and won't join up with you
I would much rather have Dupre and Segallion up front than Iolo and Gwenno And I find no mention of re ordering on the quick reference card
I'd like to know this one too
How do you use the sawmill
I found one at Xio's place but I can't figure out how to use it to cut the yew log
Is there a saw mill somewhere else
I tried asking Xio to cut it for me but she didn't know what I was talking about
There is a sawmill elsewhere
Try east of Minoc
Anyone know how to tell if you can take something and not get accused of stealing
For instance if you go to Iolo's Hut select Iolo and have him search the place and take something it says quot Stealing quot But other places let you take stuff
I believe you can take anything for free in the Castle
MAJOR SPOILERS WARNING There is a simple way to steal lots of items with cost of only one karma point
Just get a bag and move all the stuff into it
Thenin one fell swoop As much as you can carry
You can clean up a whole town if you have the patience
Of course I never did that
Finally could someone tell me all of the things of interest in the sewers below British's castle
I've searched the place pretty thoroughly but I'm afraid I might have missed something and I don't want to spend the time looking through the whole place again
Ever heard of the thieve's guild and such
It's rumored that they have a connection with the buccaneers of the Den
For starters try looking for one lady who wields two glass swords when you come upon an underground lake
Incidently this one leads to thesecond serie of quests in the game
Well it seems that I can't drop anything from any of my characters
This is very frustrating as my people collect more and more stuff they can't get rid of anything
Has anyone else out there in netland have this problem also
Let me clarify my problem
My characters try to drop something and the object quot magically quot reappears in their hands
I tried it in solo mode no luck
I tried it not using a mouse no luck
I did find a solution for the problem
I reran the install configure program don't ask me why and that fixes the problem for a short time

The problem reoccured so I ran the install
The install fixes it for a short time
One little problem in Yew The Lady Mayor writes a permission slip to give to the guard so that you can talk the the thief in solitary confinement
However the guard's key that he gives you only opens one door
The thief is behind the next one
the key does not fit the other door but at least returning it yields two karma points
You don't need to open the second door to talk to the man
Just speak to him through the window
By the way you'll need those two extra karma points you get for returning the key because you'll lose a couple for being forced to lie
I sort of felt sorry for the poor guy in prison
Can anybody tell me where I can find Budo
Homer in Bucaneer's Den tells me to talk to him
Try checking for secret doors
Use a gem or PEER spell to locate possible place
Karma seems to go up when you give a dragon's egg to the chef in Serpent's Hold and the dragon's egg isn't even taken away
In this version therefore Karma can be increased to real quickly which lets you steal just about anything you'd like to
Does anyone know whether quot Animate quot costs karma points How about killing the animated creature
Taking the quot corpse quot doesn't appear to
I have not been very clear about Karma Points and should have added 'at each shrine' to the above
That means that Basic Karma Points Talking to shrines Total
You will have a maximum of Karma points and the excess Karma points will give you some flexibility in doing a few 'unAvatar like' deeds like pick pocketing the thief guild belt from Phoenix
From getting to level I can give you a rough outline of Exp points needed to advance


gt gt gt gt gt I'm not sure on the exact numbers obviously but they are close if you want experience go to the dungeons and use missle weapons
The dungeon below Lord British's Castle is fairly interesting and large and you can get at least points there maybe not the most efficient but it isn't far to walk and not that difficult to survive in Also in case nobody else has figured this out theHELP spellwill NOT take anything from you experience or reagents if your entire party is alive so cast it EARLY
If someone dies including you then the person will lose Exp points
If you cast it early you lose time and nothing else
I've been reading various postings and it seems that people believe that the messages Squid wounded' and Fighter Critical' are bugs but NO If you take the path that leads West from Britain you'll eventually hit a N S corssing right near the coastline at this T you will sometimes find other people fighting each other
and you can come in and clean up the mess retrieving gold in the process
But as you are walking closer to the T and they are fighting you get messages
It seems that because Ultima VI has only one mode as opposed to In City or In Castle like Ultima VI the game keeps track of things much farther away
If you'll notice whenever monsters hit themselves you get messages so it makes sence that when you get those messages there are monstersoutside of your view but close enough for the game to keep track of that are beating on eachother BTW this is also why VI is so much slower than V in V you had to enter towns shrines anything to get off the World map hence less things to calculate in World mode
Vi is slow but it is doing a lot of work which I feel makes it a much more realisticadventure game
PS Yes I do have a fast machine and a HD
Well I can tell you that the quot Lord British poisoned quot message is a bug
I've had this one several times and every time it happens Lord British is nowhere near his castle anymore
I think he's dead
That's why I keep a backed up version of my savegame directory
For those of you who have problems with your EGA version of Ultima VI try playing without the mouse once I did this most of the screen displaying bugs disappeared
I did find one nifty little bug though Let's say Dupre dies so you pick him up and look for the nearest healer
Along the way you pick up a couple more companions so now you have eight people in your party
Of course when you find the healer you forget this and have Dupre raised Oops
The game gets all screwed up
Mostly because you can't ask Dupre to leave so no provisions were made for him when he doesn't fit in it
Something to watch out for From pa sdcc ucsd edu The Blessed Wraith There isone more dungeon called the Swamp Cavewhere you can find a whole set of magic items including the second Storm Cloak in the game
More tips You don't need to dive into Hythloth for that scroll
I did it the otherway around The crystal ball is truly a wonderful item
I know all areas of Britania before I set one foot out of the castle
Incidentally that is how I found the Swamp Cave mentioned above
If only I can carry that thing around
You don't need to carry lots of weighty powder kegs around
You need just one and a spell called REPLICATE
In fact that's the only useful item that the spell is effective on You only need a th level spell ENCHANT to get a th level effect if you have a staff
It's sometimes cheaper that way
you need to be th level though Use the PICKPOCKET spell to keep one of your magic shield
I did find a second magic shield later in the game The most useful spell in dungeons is MASS INVISIBILITY
Get everyone a ring of invisibility for emergence Keep the fan you find in Hawkin's treasure horde
It will come handy someday if you don't want to waste lots of spells WIND CHANGE
If you have enough karma points there are a few chests that might interest you Ephemerides keeps a handsome amount Xiao has a bag full of spell reagents Someone in Britania retains lots of gold nuggets make your guess There is a spiked collar lying around somewhere in Serpents Hold A chest full of gems in Minoc make your guess again By using the 'Bag Trick' you should get away with a few items with minimal erosion to your integerity I once had karma points and had absolutely no idea how I got them
If you are really thirsty for gold find the Book of Lost Mantras at the Lycaeum Library and talk to one of the wisps

Ultima VIII Pagan Walkthrough and Tips Pagan while not an especially difficult game tends to be vague in some areas on what you're supposed to do or where you're supposed to go
Also the catacomb caverns can be a confusing place and you will be spending a lot of time down there
Further while it doesn't appear so on the surface the game is actually quite linear
There are certain actions you must do inorder to trigger other events
For instance you won't be able to visit the Sorcerers until after Hydros is free and you've talkedto Devon
If you go to the lava cave before that there is no way to get across to the Sorcerer enclave
Combat in this game is a pain
I generally avoided fighting whenever possible and that was most of the time
Unless therereally isn't much room to maneuver you can easily run around or away from anything
On the other hand you certainly want to bring your strength up to maximum as quickly as possible so you can carry morestuff
The easy if tedious way to do this is to find a quiet place the palace cellar for example and just stand there bashingaway at a wall or door for awhile
Eventually your ST and DEX will reach their maximums of is the highest you can get
However the only way to increase INT is to cast spells and plenty of them
Money isn't all that important in the game
You will need coins at the end to purchase Ethereal Travel from Mythran so make sure you have that much at least put aside
You do NOT need any of the other spells he knows so if you want to save money don't buy them
You DO need to buy the secret door scroll though as it comes in handy in a couple of places later on
The only other use for money is to buy armor from the blacksmith
However you will be finding all kinds of armor along the way and weapons too so you don't have to buy anything here either if you'd rather not
You can steal anything in this game without penalty provided you follow the one golden rule don't touch if someone is in theroom with you
You have to be alone in the room to move things or take them
People can be outside or in the next room or anywhere else
As for all the jumping I don't have any tricks to share
It is wise to save after every jump when possible there are times whenyou don't want to save though as for example on a vanishing platform
Angles are often tricky and it isn't always easy to judge distances correctly
I did a lot of saving and restoring during the game
You probably will too especially on the path to Lithos which is the single worst sequence in the game
After that it's not so bad but you will be doing leaps and jumps right throughto the end so get used to it
After you have learned Sorcerer spells especially Flash jumping around is less of a problem
Flash can teleport you instantlyto any visible location on the screen
Unfortunately you don't get these spells until almost near the end
Starting In Tenebrae Okay so you begin at the fisherman Devon's camp
The only thing worth taking is his bedroll
The bedroll allows you to rest almost anywhere
Just keep it rolled up in your backpack and double click it no need to remove it from the backpack whenever you need to sack out
This is the best way to recover hit points and mana
Then you move off NW to the docks where you witness the execution of Toran
Nothing you can do about that
After it's over follow the path into the town of Tenebrae
This place can be irritating because of the layout
The palace is the center of the town The south gate leads to the docks and the north gate to the mountains
East and west of the palace are where all the inhabitants live
Be sure to walk up to the top of the palace to activate the receiver there
This will allow you to use the recall device to return quickly and easily to Tenebrae throughout the game
Since there is no time limit in the game you can take your time to become familiar with the town
On the east side you particularly want to find Salkind the Seneschal's house just north of there is Aramina's house the door of which is locked until Bloodwatch
Salkind also has a nice treasure cache
When he's not around look for two keys they are in different rooms hidden under items
One unlocks the door to the chest and the other unlocks the chest itself
The chest is trapped so be sure you either use a detrap scroll or have a lot of hit points to survive the explosion
Among other things the chest holds coins
You can leave those there until you're ready to buy Ethereal Travel from Mythran
Also on the east side you want to find the library and talk to Bentic
This is the beginning of the main path through the game
Talking to him will trigger certain responses from Mythran that otherwise do not appear so make sure you find the library and have that chat
Toran's widow lives on the east side too
She is only important if you want to make some money selling gems
Otherwise you don't have to bother too much about her
Moving to the west side locate the house of the blacksmith
If you want some armor go to the next room and sleep until he leaves the shop
Then help yourself to whatever you want and sleep again until the shop reopens so you can leave
While you may not be buying anything from him he will be important later on for constructing the foci for the Air spells
Another place you want to locate is the burned out building with the undead wandering around it
Just remember where it is as you will have to come here later to pick something up
There is nothing of interest inside the house or in the basement unless youneed a bedroll
When you've finished your tour of Tenebrae and have spoken with Bentic leave by the north gate and follow the path up to the cave that leads to the Plateau
Stop off at the guardhouse on the way
You can get in by jumping up to the little bridge that connects the buildings
Inside one building is a key ring you can use for the keys you find
Just quot use quot a key and click on the ring
After that you can just click on the ring and then a door to try and open it
The cave is basically a straightforward path although do be careful at the jumping stones
One way leads to a trapped chest
The other goes on to the hermit
The only place of real difficulty here is the area with the levers
In order to open the southern gates you have to cross over the bridge to the ruined building
Do not touch the single lever standing apart from the others
Pull all levers that do NOT have bones or bodies in front of them
Then go back across the bridge and pull the lever by the winch opening thesouth gates
You will have to dodge some electrical traps on your way in to see Mythran
Fortunately you only have to do this once
During your conversation be sure to purchase the secret door scroll
While he tells you it only works once you can in fact use it several times so one is all you'll ever need
You also want to be certain he mentions the Necromancers so Vividos will be around when you come to visit
When the conversation ends Mythran gives you the recall device a small disk that can teleport you instantly to any active receiveron the island
It will work anywhere except one place the Sorcerer enclave
You CANNOT teleport out of that area although youcan 'port in
Many people thought the recaller ran out of uses because it didn't work here
THAT IS NOT THE CASE
It still functions just not anywhere in the enclave or the lava cave before it
You have to go all the way back to the double doors before you can teleport
After talking with the hermit feel free to help yourself to anything you like
In this instance you aren't stealing as Mythran has allowed you to take whatever catches your fancy
Do go upstairs to turn on the receiver up there so you can get back here the easy way later
From here you might want to walk out and get the Hammer of Strength see Neat Weapons at the end of the file or teleport directly back to Tenebrae and maybe go for Slayer also in the Neat Weapons section
Whatever the next thing is to go visit the cemetery out the east gate
Just follow the path and you'll get there
Necromancy amp Catacombs Vividos will tell you about the stolen dagger and of course you offer to bring it back
This is where you have to visit Aramina at her house
Remember she's only there at Bloodwatch
You will probably have to talk to her twice being certain to assure her she won't get into trouble
She'll hand over the key that unlocks both the closet and the chest
The key to the queen's bedroom is under a cushion in the throne room
You can grab that anytime the room is deserted
If you want an easy time of it after getting Aramina's key and the one under the cushion sleep until the queen has woken up and is having breakfast
Then you can waltz right in and grab the dagger
The chest by the way isn't trapped
Return to the cemetery and hand the dagger to Vividos
After the ceremony he will make you his apprentice and send you out topick up a couple of special reagents
The executioner's hood is in a pit to the south of the graveyard entrance the stone arch
A couple of changelings wander around in it
The hood is on the tree in the center
There are several leaves on the tree they are hardto see so look close
The sticks are under the tree by the burned out house in West Tenebrae
No other wood will do the job so you do have to go therefor them
The ghost can make this difficult kill it or lure it away and then grab the sticks they look sorta like twigs
After you bring these items back to Vividos he'll send you out once more this time to talk to previous Necromancers in the catacombs
The catacombs are reached through the small building to the north of where you talk to Vividos
Enter through the door on the east side go up the middle aisle and cast Open Earth to create the entrance to the catacombs
This is a nasty place with plenty of undead roaming around traps here and there and floors that occasionally give way droppingyou to a sudden and unpleasant death
Be careful where you walk and save often it's usually safest to stick close to the walls but that isn't a complete guarantee of safety
What you're looking for is a small freestanding room with a ghoul and a jewelry chest inside
You can see this from the top ie the room has no roof
When you step inside the floor gives way dropping you down to the beginning of the path to the Necromancers
Help yourself to any reagents from the barrels then move on along the passage until you come to the first Necromancer
Use Death Speak to talk to him and learn the Mask of Death spell
Then go back the way you came keeping an eye out for the wall he mentioned it's on the right hand side
Climb over this wall and keep going
You'll have to get past four demons blocking the way
You can use the Mask of Death spell to make them ignore you
I preferred to do some fancy broken field running and just slip past them which isn't all that hard if you can break up the group by moving away and getting one or two to follow you then running past them
Go roughly north and east to the next Necromancer who will tell you the Rock Flesh spell
You will need this spell to get through the passage with the lightning bolts
Although you get no message or special effects when you cast Rock Flesh it is actually active
Run up the corridor and on to the next Necromancer who gives you Summon Dead
Whenthis conversation ends you are teleported to a new section of the caves
The fourth Necromancer is beyond the electrical barrier
He gives you Grant Peace and teleports you to another new place
Head northeast to the small patch of woods
Here you will see a room with a couple of chests outside
These are safe to open
Whenyou walk inside the room you are teleported yet again to another new area
Jump across the chasm and head south
You will come to a raised area with some magic armor
Most of the floor is a trap andwill give way if you step on it
Go up the right hand side and stay as close to the wall as you can
After you have the armor goback north and jump across the lava
Climb up to the top of the stone island and head north
Keep an eye out to the right for asingle large stone
Jump to that and you're teleported once again
Run up past the fireball spitters to the fifth Necromancer who will give you the Resist Death spell
My notes become a littlesketchy here and it isn't mentioned whether or not you get teleported again but it's likely
Continue on in the new area until you reach the sixth and last Necromancer who is next to the stairs out
He will give you the Create Golem spell
A ghost and otherundead will appear when you try to walk up the stairs so be ready with a Grant Peace or two for the occasion
The Path To Lithos The exit brings you back to the catacombs
Jump down and head roughly south to the small door leading to the caves
Fromthere go generally southwest and then west until you reach an area with two stone bridges
Cross the lower one and continueon until you come to an area with a fire dart trap with a wall in front of it
In the center of this area is a pedestal with a switch Make your way to the switch and pull it
Then climb the pedestal and jump over to the door that leads to Stone Cove
In the cove head to the east where you should see a pair of big double doors and a smaller door to the south
Call up a golemto open the double doors
Note that you must cast the spell on dirt not stone
Some people had problems with that
Rememberthis is an earth golem and it can only be created from earth
You are now on the path to Lithos
Go northeast first to the ruined house
Approach this carefully as part of the ground here isnot stable and you'll die in a pit if you don't watch where you walk
Pull the lever outside the house then walk around to the leftside and climb in
Pull the lever inside the house
Some ghouls will appear at this point it's best to just avoid them and climb back out again
Thengo around and up to the northwest passing a large rock with an quot A quot rune on it
Dodge the fireball spitters and continue up to theend of the passage
A bridge has now appeared across the chasm to the left
Unfortunately half the bridge fades out while the other half fades in
I found it best to run quickly over the near half when it's solid and jump to the other side about a third or so of the way across the second half
There is an earth golem on this side but it's nothard to avoid
Now you come to the sliding platforms
Sorry to say there is nothing for it but jumping over to them one a time save often here
Even worse on the other side is another earth golem and a set of vanishing platforms
These don't move but like the bridge they fade in and out so these jumps will be very tricky especially with the golem around
There are some solid platforms along the way and these are good places to save
Never save on a disappearing platform it's very likely to vanish right out from under you if you restore to that position
You get a breather from jumping for awhile after you make it across the chasm about time too
This area has a lot of nasty force fields between the stone pillars and between the pillars and the wall
Pick up some of the green and blue mushrooms and toss them ahead of you to pick out the safe path through the fields
Alternatively you can just push on ahead taking damage from thefields and sleeping when your hit points get too low
It's certainly the less tedious way to get past them
At the end is a chest
Climb up to it after the stalactite falls
Inside is a key and a gem of protection
The gem will keep you safe from harm on your way back through the forcefields just walk right through them
The key opens the locked door at the other end
Go through the door and follow the tunnel to the fire mushroom cave
Go carefully up to the northeast and the sinking stones These are like the ones on the way to the hermit except that they slowly sink and rise
As with the vanishing platforms time your jumps carefully and do not save on any stone that is not stationary
At the other end as you go up north stay close to the west wall and watch for two narrow passages these are very easy to miss so watch carefully
The first passage leads to a chest with some potions
Under the potions is a key
This key unlocks the door in the second west passage
Go through that door and around to more sliding platforms
These however are not a problem
I found that by jumping to the right hand rim of the chasm and walking as far along it as possible I was able to jump to the other side thereby avoiding the platforms completely
Fortunately you're just about done
After you get across simply walk north between the rows of undead and have your littlemeeting with Lithos
West of the chasm is another of those receiver platforms although there isn't much point to activating it asthere isn't any reason to come back here
When you're done use the recall item to get you back out quickly and then returnto Vividos
He'll question you about your meeting with Lithos then hand you the Key of The Scion and tell you to bury Lothian
She's justoutside in the northeast corner where the skull candles have been placed
She's also a little hard to see but if you look closely you can discern her location
Simply stand next to the body and double click on it you do not have to click the Scion Key onher or do anything elaborate
With that accomplished you return to Vividos once more your last visit to him by the way and he'll tell you it's time to go onyour pilgrimage to Morien's grave
This is a fake
You'll never find the grave so there is no point in looking for it
The supposed idea behind this canard is to get you to thoroughly explore the Pit of Death thereby finding the Conventicle of the Dead and the Heart of Earth buried inside
Interlude Pit of Death You can reach this area in two ways by suffering through the lower catacombs the Scion Key opens the door or the easy way by going through the small door in Stone Cove Scion Key opens this door too
After going through the Stone Cove door head west
You'll come to the Conventicle of the Dead pretty quickly
Walk right up as close as you can to the building
Note you can see a patch of dirt inside
Cast a golem spell on the earth and have the golem open the door for you you may also want to have him attack the skeletons to keep them off your back
Hurry in to the dirt patch and cast Open Earth on the center of it
This reveals the Heart of Earth
Once you have that you are finished with the Pit of Death
There is also a key for the Conventicle doors
This is at the other end of the Pit which is actually a series of caverns near to where you would come in from the lower catacombs
It's with the body of Someone or Other Conventicler which is inside a gate that has a lever next to it
If you came in from the lower catacombs you may want to look for this but going through Stone Cove and using the golem is much easier
Interlude The Fate Door In the upper catacombs is a building with the sign quot Towards Fate Do You Travel quot
The door is opened with the Scion Key
Inside jump over the lava patch and continue on through the quot Do Not Enter quot door
This series of caves is something of a respite as you won't have to fight or evade anything along the way
In fact it's pretty much a straightforward jaunt
Every time you come to a door outlined with white bricks summon up a golem from the nearby earth patchand have it open the door
Unfortunately you won't be able to have the golem follow you through the doors so you'll have to call upa new golem for each door along the way
As you proceed be sure to pick up the Zealan ceremonial shield lying on the ground
Somewhere on the way you'll come to anarea with chests and boxes and a beam across the entry way
Jump over the beam and help yourself to whatever you want in here
You especially want to pick up any keys as one of these opens the door to the statues of the Zealan gods at the end of the Fate path
When you arrive at the statues drop the shield anywhere on the floor
The statues will talk to you automatically telling you about Khumash Gor and the important item obelisk tip he holds
The only way through the door to him is by using the secret door scroll
Also very important the Zealan shield must still be on the floor for this to work
On redoing this section I had a lot of trouble getting through that door the scroll didn't work until I dropped the shield again I had picked it up so the statues wouldn't keep telling me quot We can't do any more for you quot as I walked around the room
You can fight Khumash Gor if you like I just nipped in grabbed the obelisk tip and zipped right on out again
This can be done by walking up the left hand side of the room staying very close to the wall
You can then get part way across the north wall before Khumash notices you
The tip is in one of the jewel boxes behind his throne
After he summons the ghost just move closer to the boxes open them snarf the obelisk tip and run out again remembering to shut the door behind you so the ghost won't follow
The statues will then tell you that your fate is to become the Titan of Ether by stealing the power of the other four titans
This is alittle vague but they aren't going to provide any more information
Good thing you have this walkthru to fill in the gaps
In any case you are finished with the Fate path and can go on to better things
Argentrock Isle Argentrock like every other place is reached through the caves of the upper catacombs
You want to find a cavern with a double stone bridge and a single door with a spiked wall door opens with Scion Key
Going through this door following the path and crossing the bridge will bring you to the Theurgists
Make sure you find and activate the receiver along the way it's south of thevillage
There aren't many to talk to only Stellos Cyrrus Torwin and Xavier have anything to say
You should of course talk to all ofthem especially Xavier who will start you on the tests of the Theurgists
The test of wisdom is tricky as there are NO books in the library about their philosophy all the reading material is about the air spells
This makes answering the questions properly somewhat difficult
The key to the correct answers is to keep in mind the precepts of honesty compassion and humility
For instance if you get the question about the dying commander you would be honest and tell him the battle has been lost
Likewise if you get the one about the prodigal you welcome him back
If others are boasting about their favorite Titan you keep your mouth shut and say nothingabout Stratos
Etc
And of course you would prefer the breezy porch Stratos being an air deity
The second test is fairly simple
You go to Windy Point west of the village climb up to the air symbol and try not to fall off by walking in the opposite direction to the one the wind is blowing you
Having passed those tests you will be sent on to Stellos who gives you the key to the silver mine under the monastery
This oneis also simple you just pick up as many pieces of silver ore as you want for air spells
You certainly want Fade From Sight Reveal Restoration Hear Truth and Aerial Servant
The rest are optional Air Walk is special you will get that from Stratos later
When you have all the silver you want bop back to Tenebrae have the blacksmith forge the symbols free of charge
then returnto Argentrock to activate them on the altar in the monastery
Just put the foci on the altar one at a time
Now you hear about Xavier's stolen healing focus
Well there aren't many suspects so it's pretty obvious the thief is Torwin
Alittle proof however would help
Talk to both Xavier and Stellos mentioning that you have talked to Torwin
After hearing what they have to say find Cyrrus cast Hear Truth and question him about Torwin
You'll learn that Torwin has gone to Windy Point NOTE Torwin does not appear at the Point until you hear about it from Cyrrus
Go there yourself and witness Torwin's last moments
Tough luck on Torwin
Pick up the ring and the focus and return to town
Stellos will now send you on your final test back under the monastery
Go west left when you get down there
Use Aerial Servantto bring the torax to your side of the chasm then cast Restoration on it
That completes the tests and now you are ready to meet Stratos
Sorry to say this involves more jumping around
After the leap from Windy Point yes do have faith here you will have to haul yourself from platform to platform until you reach Stratos
However at least these platforms are stationary
Remember the route you took because you will have to come this way again later in the game
Stratos gives you the Air Walk focus already activated
At this point you could use Reveal to see where the Breath of Wind is and use Aerial Servant to grab it
I don't recommend this course of action as once you take the Breath ALL air spells except Air Walk stop working
These spells are handy so don't take the Breath until you are ready for the end game ie have gotten theTongue of Flame and Tear of Seas
That finishes Argentrock and you don't need to return here again until you want the Breath
Interlude Devon amp Hydros Somewhere along the line when you return to Tenebrae a guard stops you with the cheery news that Bentic has been executedand Devon arrested
It's a little late to help poor Bentic but you can save Devon
Indeed the game won't go much further if youdon't rescue him
For that you have to read Bentic's journal which is in the evidence room in the palace cellar
This is the room at the far right sidethat has no apparent entrance
Use the secret door scroll to open a way in and read the journal
As soon as you finish several guards will come in talk about setups
It's best to go quietly you can't defeat them in a fight
They hustle you to the docks where Devon is on the verge of losing his head
Do be careful what you say here do NOT use the quot no birthright quot line as that will just get you and Devon killed
Announce insteadthat Devon is also a Tempest
When you've finished the Queen will go bonkers killing off Salkind and the guards while knocking out everyone else except Devon who kills her
After he goes splashing off make another trip to the catacomb caves to visit Hydros there is no point to freeing Hydros beforeDevon has been saved especially as the storms do awful things to the colors
NOTE you must have gone through the Fate pathand obtained the obelisk tip before Hydros will talk to you
You want to find a narrow passage that leads down to an electrical trap in the wall
Past the trap is a cave with a locked door
Usethe Scion Key to open the door to Hydros' area
Jump across the bridges until you reach Hydros
She wants freedom before giving you any Tempest spells
Of course she's lying and why you'd want to trust someone or thingthat has been trapped for centuries I dunno
However you do have to follow along and let her loose
On the west side of her cave is an entry to another cave
Look for a wall with spikes on top
There is a gap where one spike is missing climb over that and through the quot window quot in the next cavern
Keep going until you come to the grave
Cast Open Earth onit then use the recall device to return quickly to Hydros
After she sneeringly tells you you're lucky to escape with your life zip back to Tenebrae and talk to Devon
He's usually to befound in the palace bedroom
If he's not there try the dining areas
He figures that maybe the Sorcerers who deal with Pyros can help with controlling Hydros and sends you to see them
Note that there is no way to get to the Sorcerer Enclave until Devon sends you there
Sorcerers The way to their place is again through the catacomb caverns
This time you want the double door with spikes on top
The lever outside makes one door go down and the other one come up
There are two ways of getting by here
The first way is to pull the lever move as close to the door as possible then cast Aerial Servant on the lever and walk through asthe door descends
The other way is to find the hard to see switch on the left hand wall that opens up a secret door on the right side of the woodenwall
Once past the door you come to a cavern with lava
As you approach the edgeof the lava you will automatically see Berren andhave a short chat with him
After he leaves get as close to the edge of the lava as is safe cast Air Walk and jump to the stone island
Walk around to the left side and onto the the bit of stone sticking out that leads to the rest of the cave this is what is nothere when you come here too early
Continue on jumping across the water to the next cave where the Sorcerers reside
There aren't many to talk to here either
The main ones are Bane and Vardion
Both want to do away with the other and both will ask you for the same thing the other's true name
Ally yourself with Bane and tell her Vardion's true name
After she kills him off and talks herself out of trouble with Malchir she gives you the key to the library and tells you to study up on spells
You probably noticed that the game manual doesn't have much to say about the details of Sorcerer spells
Unfortunately you will have to write down on your own the constituents of all the spells as well as the placement of candles and reagents
When you've done that and read all the other books return to Vardion's house where Bane is now in residence as First Acolyte She will ask you to enchant items with three spells
Since an item can only hold one type of spell it is best to use three items for this
Things to keep in mind when enchanting the library books only mention placement of the red candles
You must use black candles too
All the points of the pentagram that do not have red candles must have black ones
All candles around the pentagram must belit
Placing the reagents is a pain
They must be in exactly the right spot especially if they are next to a candle
And since there are times when you can be too close to pick something up as well as too far away the enchanting process can be excruciating especially if quot Something is not right quot and you have to sit there and figure out what
A lot of patience will be needed here
After you complete this test Bane will send you on to Malchir for the run through the Obsidian Fortress
You can make some extra spells before you take off or wait until you're into the tests as you'll have an opportunity or two to enchant items along the way
Useful spells to have are Flash Armor of Flames Endure Heat Extinguish Ignite and Banish Demon
For the final test withMalchir you will also need Flame Bolt Explosion and Summon Demon
You will find a talisman for summoning a demon in the tests so you don't need to make one of your own
However as you will be running into demons in the fortress it's wise to havea talisman with several Banish spells handy
The Extinguish and Ignite spells can be put on the symbols
All the other spells should go into rods or wands
You may want tohave an extra rod of Flash spells as these come in very handy and not only in the tests
Be sure to pick up and keep with you an extra red candle
At the fortress Malchir greets you and then conjures up a couple of demons to make your life more fun
I simply evaded them andran into the next room saving the banish spells for later on
There is a demon here too but this one is nonhostile
He allows you to use the pentagram and supplies to enchant items if you so desire
When you're done with that or have bypassed it if you've got everything you need walk to the far end of the room to be teleported to the tests
In each test you must find and take a blue pentagram symbol
When you have all four of them return to the starting room and step on the rock pad to return to the demon
After talking to him you can take the teleport again this time to Malchir's sanctum
Each test begins at a plaque naming the spell you will need to get through it safely
The tests are fairly simple in themselves solong as you observe reasonable care
I found that using Fade From Sight was very handy during the tests as not even demons can see you when you're invisible
Endure Heat Make your way through the narrow area a real pain avoiding or Granting Peace to the undead
When you reach the lava cast Endure Heat and splash carefully along to the end
Banish the demon then climb up and use a detrap spell on the chest before opening
The symbol is inside
Armor of Flames The entire area is full of flame bombs and fireballs as well as spiders and the occasional demon
Moving fast is a necessity here as the AoF spell won't last forever
There are two things you want to find here
One is the talisman with a Summon Demon on it The other is a pentagram with a demon shield on it
The symbol is due south of the shield
You want that shield by the way because once equipped it functions the same way as the Armor of Flames spell
You will haveto banish the demon in the vicinity before you can grab the shield
Flash This is an easy one
Just use Flash to get past the spike balls and fire mushrooms
Be careful about position though
You won'tbe able to flash to a new spot if something such as a stalactite is directly in your way
Along this path you will find Flame Sting on the floor guarded by a demon
Banish that grab the sword and continue to the end of the passage where you will find the third symbol
Extinguish Find your way to the flaming pentagram being careful of the Troll I used invisibility here myself and had no problems
This one isa little tricky
You must use extinguish on the candles all of them not the big flames
When the last candle goes out all the flames will go out as well allowing you to take the magic helm and the symbol below it
Malchir amp Tongue of Flame When you complete the Obsidian Fortress and enter the Sanctum Malchir gives you the final test which is to cast three nastyspells at him
Then he returns the favor by calling up a demon that you must banish yourself
Right after that you go automatically to the Ritual of Flame
It is for this that you need the red candle and the Ignite spell
Justfollow along doing as everyone else does watching the sequence play itself out
When it's all over you might as well finish up here by getting the Tongue of Flame
Unfortunately the only way to do this is bykilling Malchir as he has the Tongue on his person
You can return to the Sanctum and fight it out with him or you can go there invisibly bop him a couple of times with Slayer and be done with it the easy way
One thing you must be certain to do is read the book quot The Destruction of The Temple quot
This book has the only mention of the quot Tear of Seas quot
Until you have read the book you won't be able to get the Tear from Devon
So take the Tongue anything else you may want and leave the Sanctum
Go to the big outdoor pentagram where the Ritual of Flame was performed and toss the Tongue into it
After the fireworks stop Pyros has been freed take the Tongue back return all the way to the double doors and use the recall item to get to Tenebrae
Tear of Seas amp Cleaning Up Once again in Tenebrae find Devon and talk about the blackrock fragment
Eventually he'll recall the odd rock he found and giveyou the key to the chest it's in
This chest is in the palace in a room on the left hand side
Only Devon's key by the way canopen this chest
By now you have the obelisk tip Heart of Earth Tear of Seas and Tongue of Flame so it's time to say farewell to the air spells by returning to Argentrock Isle making the laborious jumps to Stratos and swiping the Breath of Air I tried using Flash several times here to cut down on the jumps but it didn't work too well the game insisted on dropping me in the wrong places where I promptlyfell to my death
Now you have all the pieces so pop over to the Plateau
Talk to Mythran once showing him the Tongue of Flame
Then talk to hima second time new conversation and say you want to re create the gate
He will offer you the Ethereal Travel spell he will only do this when you have all the pieces the two titans have been freed and he's seen the Tongue
Reading the book once activates the spell
Clicking on the book again after that will send you to the Void from which there is no return recall will not work here so be sure you have everything you need want before leaving
You won't need money or gemswhere you're going so you can drop any excess to lighten your load
Also as the air spells don't work now others still do youcan dump all the air foci except for Air Walk
End Game The Void has a large pentagram and four paths off it
These of course lead to the four titans
You can do them in any order However it is vital that you remember which path leads to which titan as this determines the order of the blackrock fragmentsaround the pentagram
You can start by placing the obelisk tip at Aphelion
This will be activated last when the other piecesare in place
Putting it here now just gets it out of your way and sets up for later
Okay okay the positions of the four activated fragments are Breath SW Tongue NW Tear NE and Heart SE
Hydros You arrive on a small rocky island with a lot of sinking stones around it
As you might expect the right one to start with is the sinking stone farthest from where you arrived roughly west northwest
Simply jump or occasionally Flash along until you cometo a familiar place namely the symbol of Hydros
Have the Tear ready
When Hydros appears double click on the Tear thenposition the crosshair on her and click once
After her power is absorbed you'll be ported automatically back to the pentagram Place the activated Tear on the pentagram and continue to the next titan
Stratos Yes more jumping and Flashing I will NOT make jokes
You do have to be very careful here as some of the stones break away when you step on them
This is especially true of the stones around the pieces of magic armor which I ignored having all magic armor by this time
You just keep on going until you reach Stratos and do the same to her with the Breath that you did toHydros with the Tear
Pyros This one is a little more elaborate
Jump north across the lava from where you start
Go east then south watching for brokenbridges
Take the second one jumping or flashing over
On the other side go east then north to the dead forest
Keep an eye onthe ground for little lava holes
I found it safest and fastest to walk along the outside southern edge of the forest
At the end up a small flight of stairs is a jewelry box with ten white balls in it
Be careful in this area as the ground is not stable and you might fall through into a lava pit
Since demons wander around here I suggest taking the entire box and getting away quickly
Go back the way you came over the bridge and north to the design with flashing colors
Put one ball on each color
When all the balls have vanished a series of stepping jumping
stones appears in the lava
Flash is good to use here to get over them
At the end have the Tongue ready for your meeting with Pyros
He summons up a pair of demons to deal with you
The simple wayto handle this situation is to drink an invis potion or use an invis scroll just before you walk up to Pyros
The demons can't see you and you'll be able to take care of the titan without interference
Lithos This one is perhaps the most difficult as you have to make your way through a series of caves and unlike the others the locationof Lithos is not readily apparent
I didn't make note of the directions it was somewhat confusing as it was but you want to keep going until you come to the place with the lava and stones
I found that you don't have to jump the stones you can walk around the edge of the lava and reach the other side that way
Then continue on until you come to a cave with a triangular corner in the north wall
That is where Lithos appears so be sure the Heart is ready
Finale Once the four activated blackrock fragments have been placed on the pentagram along with the obelisk tip double click on the tip then on yourself
This activates the tip and automatically brings the black gate into existence
Step through and you're finally done
Neat Weapons There are several magic weapons in the game
Since even at max strength your carrying capacity will be limited you probably won't be lugging all of these around and besides you can only use one weapon at a time anyway
Hammer of Strength This is in a cave west of where you exit onto the Plateau
Just follow the mountain edge west and you'll come to it usually there is a changeling or two in the vicinity
Just dodge them and enter the cave
There are a lot of traps here so be careful
The hammer is in a chest to the SE of a pair of big double doors I never got them open myself
The skeleton warrioron guard will not attack until you pass him
The chest is trapped so you will want to run down to the end of the passage and getthe detrap scroll from the body
I suggest waiting until after you've seen Mythran so you can use the recall device to get out of here quickly Note the Hammer does not actually increase your character's strength but it is magical and will hit anything
Mace Slayer Out of the city on the east side is a ruined hut with a body in it
Walk far enough in and you'll fall through the floor
This will land you in a cave
Proceed generally west from here keeping one step ahead of the trolls and other critters
The way islong and hard but these areas are small and if you are thorough you won't have too much trouble finding Slayer
Slayer candeliver a killing blow to anything when it does you will hear a thunderclap
It usually takes several shots however before this happens
Sword Protector This is in the closed up house under the monastery on Argentrock Isle
You must use the secret door scroll to open the way inside
Protector adds five points to your armor class when equipped
Axe Deceiver This is across the sinking stones south of Stone Cove
It adds points to armor protection
Sword Flame Sting This is in one of the tests of the Sorcerers
You'll find it just lying there on the ground ready for taking solong as you manage to elude or banish the nearby demon
It's one of the neatest weapons in the game as when you use it itcauses a wall of fire to appear around the target helping the cause with a little immolation
Sword of Striking This is in the lair of the Master of the Sorcerers
I didn't use this one too much myself having becomeenamored of Flame Sting for some reason
It does seem to hit well however

Her pattern is to teleport in front of you scream then fire her energyprojectiles
Your job is to blast her when she appears in front of you then quickly start to movebefore she can retaliate Let's get ready to rumble One of the problems in this level is that there are no health power ups Keep this in mind and avoid risky maneuvers

Press the hand sign and the tree will open
Enter the tree and climb all the way down
Follow the tunnel until you are in a circular room with four different blue lit images
On the pedestal beneath the light you'll find an opened linking book
Examine the book and click on the image inside the book to get yourself linked to Relto Relto actually isn't a real Age
It's more a kind of a bus stop
From here you can travel to all other Ages
Whenever you get stuck you can always link back to Relto to go to another Age
During your travels around the different Ages you'll find some Relto pages
By adding them to your linking book the outlook of Relto will change a bit
Look around and notice four wooden pillars and a house
Walk towards the house and open the door
Enter the house
Next to the closed window you'll see a small handle
Push the handle to open the shutters
When you examine the room you'll see an empty book case at the left side a closet and another book case at the right side of the room
When you open the closet you can change clothes if you want
You can change your appearance every time you visit this room
Walk towards the book case at the right side
Take the book and read it
It describes the four Ages you have to travel to the Teledahn Age the Gahreesen Age the Kadish Tolesa Age and the Eder Kemo amp Eder Gira Age
Notice that the pages are numbered in D'ni numbers at the bottom of each page
Now you have the D'ni numbers from to
Make a note of these D'ni numbers with their corresponding normal numbers
You are going to need this later in the game
Leave the house and walk towards the four wooden pillars
Each of these pillars contains a linking book to one of the four Ages
First thing I did was opening all of the pillars and get me linked to the corresponding Age and get me linked back to Relto again
So I gathered all linking books at the same time
You can do this in a different way if you like of course
Let's start with the first one at the left
Press the hand sign
It lights up green and it opens
Click on the linking book and on the image
This will take you to the Eder Kemo amp Eder Gira Age
When you arrive there just click on the linking book at the left corner of your screen
Click on the linking book to open it and click on the image to get yourself linked back to Relto
When you return to Relto you'll notice that there is a red book in the book case at the left side now
Go outside again and now press the hand sign of the first pillar at the right side
It lights up orange
Click on the linking book and on the image to go to Teledahn
When you arrive there return to Relto again
Now there is also an orange book in the book case
Exit the room and press the hand sign of the last pillar at the left side
It lights up blue
Click on the linking book and on the image to go to Gahreesen
Link yourself back to Relto again
Now there is a green book added to the book case
Go out once more and do the same with the last pillar at the right side
This one lights up purple
Click on the book and on the image to go to Kadish Tolesa
Link yourself back to Relto once more
Now you have all linking books for the Ages gathered
From the left to the right you have a green book linking to the Gahreesen Age an orange book linking to the Teledahn Age a purple book linking to the Kadsih Tolesa Age and finally a red book linking to the Eder Kemo amp Eder Gira Age
Notice the little green squares beneath each book
If you ever want to reset one of the Ages to start it all over just press the square beneath the appropriate book
Remember the order of the Ages which are described in the book in the book case at the right side Teledahn Gahreesen Kadish Tolesa and Eder Kemo amp Eder Gira
I think it's the best to keep this order in Ages
So let's start with the Teledahn Age Take the orange book out of the book case
Open it and click on the image to get yourself to
The Teledahn Age You are standing in a hut
Notice the manhole on the floor
You can try to open it but it won't budge
It's firmly locked
And that's just good because the room beneath it is floated with water
So opening the manhole now would bring you nothing but death by drowning
Leave the hut and walk along the platform to the back side of the hut
There you'll find thefirst Journeyof this Age
Press it to activate it
Walk back towards the entrance of the hut
Cross the bridge and go to the left
At the first intersection go to the right
Keep on walking and go the first intersection to the left
Walk until you reach the platform with the antenna the telescope and a device with the yellow flashing D'ni number on it
So press that device tree times to bring out the antenna
Now walk to the opposite side of the platform and look trough the telescope
Notice that it has a metal ring at the center
Also notice that it has four buttons to press
One at the left one at the right and two at the bottom up and down
By pressing these buttons you can move the telescope in the corresponding direction
Your goal is to find the sun and track it down in the center ring
This will power up the surroundings
The best way to do this is waiting until the sun comes bye and then simply quot catch quot it in the center ring
Once this job is done leave it alone and you'll have power all the time
Walk around the platform and notice there are three big levers surrounding the platform
Pull all three of the levers
One of them is broken but you don't need that one
Notice that there is another walkway leading down the platform
It's broken halfway so no use to walk that way
In stead of that walk the walkway on which you came to the platform
At the junction go to the left
Walk all the way to the end
Notice a lever and a staircase leading down the walkway
Leave the lever alone
Also notice that there is a huge bucket hanging next to the railing
Your goal is to flip the lever not yet
run down the staircase and climb into the bucket to get a free ride up
Is that all there is you might think Well not quiet
The problem is that you only have about five seconds to climb into the bucket after you flipped the lever
After that the bucket will start it's way up leaving you behind at the walkway
I'll bet you'll have to give this a try more than once as I did o
If you fail you have to pull the lever again to get another bucket stopped at the correct spot
Here's my golden tip
If the bucket left without you walk towards the lever
See how the buckets are going to the top into another building
You can also see how another bucket will be lowered
As soon as a bucket has left the top building flip the lever and the bucket will stop at the correct spot
When you finally entered the bucket in time enjoy the view
When you are delivered by the bucket walk down the platform
Examine the room and see that there are two other niches with a telescope
Between these niches you'll find thesecond Journey
No need to say that you have to activate it
If you want you can have a look through these telescopes of course
Now walk around the room and locate the elevator
Next to the elevator at the right side you'll see a pedal on the floor
Kick the pedal to release the brake of the elevator
Turn to the right and walk towards the small control panel
Click on the control panel to sit down
Examine the controls but don't touch anything before you know what you are doing
If you do things different as described or in a different order you might get stuck further in the game
The lever and the button at the left side are controlling the buckets
No need to change that so leave them alone
The center lever will drain the water from beneath the manhole in the hut
So flip that one
Notice that it is slowly going back to top position and that the pointer at the left of it will slowly go down
Wait until that's all done
When it stops all the water beneath the hut has gone
Now flip the right switch near the red light to unlock the manhole in the hut
With the most right buttons you can switch on and off the lights over here
Leave the control panel
Step into the elevator
Press the blue button to go up
Leave the elevator and press thethird Journeynext to the window
Move the lever next to the window to get some light in the room
Examine the table with all the papers near the window
Read all the papers
There are two important papers
One is the manual about the fish tank
It says that for the models III and IV the light switch has to be pressed for longer than three seconds to open the lower portion of the tank
The other one is at the center of the table giving you some vital information about as you'll see later on seven pressure plates
Leave the table and walk towards the fish tank
At the left side of the fish tank you'll find the first Relto paper
Pick it up and click on the image
It will be added to your linking book
Now press the red switch on top of the fish tank for at least three seconds
When you let go the lower portion f the tank will lower
If not you didn't press the switch long enough
Click on the appeared linking book and on the image
You'll end up in another office
Turn around and walk towards the desk
Read all the papers and if you have time enough also read the diary of Douglas Sharper to learn lots more about the Teledahn Age
Now walk into the room with the telescope
Of course you can have a look through the scope
Look at the left wall
In stead of the expected Journey you'll find a Journey stone
Click on the image to get yourself end up on some sort of platform in some sort of swamp
There's nothing to do there
Your only way out is your linking book to Relto
So click on your linking book at the left corner of the screen to get back to Relto
Notice that there is a new brown book added to the book case
Take that fifth book and click on the image to get back to the office you just left
Walk into the room with the paintings
Click on the linking book on the pedestal and link yourself back into the office with the fish tank
Walk towards the elevator
If the elevator is not there press the blue button
Enter the elevator and push the yellow button to go down
At the first stop you are back in the control room
No need to go there again so press the yellow button once more to go further down
Now you are stopping in front of the hut
Exit the elevator and walk towards the hut
Enter the hut
Notice that the red light at the manhole is lit
Open the manhole
Climb down the manhole and go all the way down
You'll end up in a huge empty water basin
Notice that there is another ladder leading down
Climb down that ladder
You are now standing in a water pipe
Walk through the pipe
After a while you'll come along a little lit area
Shortly after that there's an opening in the water pipe at your right leading to a staircase
Climb up the staircase
You'll enter a sort of prison cell
At the wall next to the entrance you find thefourth Journey
Don't forget to activate it
When you examine the room you'll notice seven pressure plates on the floor and two closed doors
Walk toward the right closed door and look into the next room
At the wall at the back of that room you'll see a sort of control that can open the doors
The only thing is you can't reach from here
Now have a closer look and notice that there are seven signs on the control
Four of them are up the yellow ones
And three of them are down the grey ones
Each sign corresponds with the pressure plates
Now remember the piece of paper you saw back in the office
You have to press down the plates corresponding to the four up signs
With that earlier piece of paper in mind that must be number and
So in other words you have to press the two plates in front of each door Now the next question is how to press four plates at one time
Well that's easier done than said
Simply move a stone on the two pressure plates in front of each door
When you've done that the doors will open
Enter the next room
Walk towards the controls at the wall
You only have to flip one of the levers to get the next door opened
It makes no difference which lever you flip
You never know if you have to return here later so let's flip the center lever which is easy to remember
Go through the new opened door
Walk to the opposite side of the room and enter the little corridor
You are standing on a wooden platform now
Turn to the right and walk down the wooden planks until your way is blocked

Go down the walkway
At the very end you'll see a device similar to the telescopes
The difference is this one can shoot
Nice
Look through the telescope and notice that this one goes the same as the normal telescope
It however does have two extra buttons the blue blinking button on top and the big button to zoom in or to zoom out
While you are looking through the telescope find a hanging ladder on the opposite rocks
Notice that this ladder is kept in place by some rocks

After she is finished wait a second until the figure on the wall stops glowing
Touch the hand sign on the wall
This will make the totem disappear
Jump down form the ledge into the darkness
You'll end up at Relto
See what happens to the Teledahn pillar
A better proof that you finished this Age couldn't exist
Now enter the house and take the first green book from the book case
Open it and click on the image to go to
The Gahreesen Age You'll arrive in an empty room
Only one ivy is decorating the place
Somehow I get the feeling this room rotates
There is only one exit to the room
So exit the room by that way
Read the sign that is standing next to the next door
It says where you can retrieve your KI
It's a device to open doors and elevators
That seems important to me so let's get one
Go through the door and to the right
Pass the next door
Walk until you reach the under construction sign

Enter the room to the right once more
Go passed the door to the left this time
Now enter the room with the KI device dispenser
Walk towards the machine with the blue lit sign
Press the blue sign to get yourself a KI device twisted around your hand
Turn to the left and notice another under construction sign
Walk passed that sign and enter the next room
Be careful not to step down the crevice yet
In stead of that jump across the crevice
Climb up the debris
Walk a little further until you are standing in some sort of doorpost
At the right side you'll find thefirst Journeyof this Age
Activate it of course
Climb back over the debris
This time jump down the crevice
Pick up the Relto page
Click on the image to add it to your Relto linking book
There is only one way out of the crevice and that is linking back to Relto
Notice there are now some rocks and tree stumps added to the landscape
So that is what these Relto pages actually do adding things to the Relto place
Walk towards the book case
Get and page through the green book
This time click on the Journey sign to get yourself linked back to the room with the debris
Climb the debris once more and exit the room through the door at your right side

Jump up the next crack in the wall towards the two orange cones
Jump al the way up
Cross the wooden plank over the gap
Go through the crack in the wall at your right side
Walk passed the next under construction sign
Enter another crack in the wall
Notice that there is a rotating part at the end of the crack
Stand in front of this rotating part and keep on walking against it until you are taken to another dark pathway
Immediate turn around and face another rotating part
This rotating part is made of solid stone
When you'll wait for a while you'll see to rooms passing by
One room is the small corridor leading to the under construction sign in the corridor you just came from
The other is a bigger room with some sort of device
As soon as this bigger room appears quickly step into that room
If you make the mistake to end up in the corridor with the under construction sign try again
Examine this room
There is some kind of huge wheel laying on the floor
Notice that there are two pedals next to the wheel one at the left and one at the right
At the wall at the back of the room you'll see four signs and four buttons
At the left side from these controls you'll see a Journey attached to the wall
Passed this wall you'll see a grate on the floor
When you step on this grate a huge column will start rising
Your goal is to power up this Age with this grate the controls at the wall and the pedals next to the wheel
It's just a matter of being quick enough
Let's get started
Step on the grate to get the column into the highest position
Quickly run to the most left button of the controls at the wall
Push the button and quickly run back to the grate and step on it to get the column into the highest position again
Quickly run to one of the pedals near the wheel and kick it down
Quickly run back to the grate and step on it to raise the column into the highest position again
Quickly run to the other pedal and kick it down as well
Quickly run back to the grate and step on it to raise the column to the highest position once more
Now run to the controls at the wall and push the second button from the left
After the wheel has gone up press the other two buttons of the control
If you aren't quick enough and the column goes all the way down before you step on the grate you have to start all over again
After you powered up the Age press thethird Journey
Now you have a good saved point
Turn to the left and walk passed the grate and the column and exit through the door at this end of the room
Walk through the corridor
The first door to the right will lit green
Only blue lit doors can be opened so walk passed this door
Go passed the next door in the corridor
Keep on walking until you reach the under construction sign
Enter the crack in the wall at your right side
Now you're back in the room with the orange cones and the wooden plank over the gap
Simply jump down into the room with the debris
Jump across the crevice
If you end up in the crevice link back to Relto and click on the green book
In that case click on the Journey sign to get back to the control room where you powered up the Age and try again
Exit through the door and you'll be back in the room with the KI device
Go through the door opposite to the KI device
Walk straight on to the door with the green light
Push the green light and enter the elevator
Once you are on top of the building walk to the left and step on the walkway that's leading out
Enjoy the view but be careful not to fall down
Wait until the black rock with another Journey is passing by

Press thefourth Journey
Now turn to the left and notice another rotating building
This one has very long walkways sticking out
Your goal is to jump on one of the walkways
If you fail you'll be linked back to Relto
In that case click on the green book and on the Journey sign to get yourself linked back to this black rock with the Journey and try again
When you made the run and jump successfully walk all the way to the door of the building and enter
Climb up the stairs and go through the next door
There are a few things to find in this building
I can't tell you exactly where you can find the different rooms of this building
That depends on which walkway you jumped on and by that by which door you entered the building
So look around until you find the blue KI data notebook the Journey stone the green Gahreesen data notebook and last but not least another Journey
First find the room with the green Gahreesen data notebook on the table

See what happens to the Gahreesen pillar
A better proof that you finished this Age couldn't exist
Now enter the house and take the third purple book from the book case
Open it and click on the image to go to
The Kadish Tolesa Age Turn a little to the right and go through the small passage
Walk all the way to the end
Climb up the stairs
Walk around the room until you face the gap in the floor
Turn around and walk towards the last pillar
Press thefirst Journeyof this Age
Turn around and walk towards the gap in the floor
Line up with the opposite side and make a rum jump to the opposite side
Walk further around the room and climb up the stairs at your right
At this platform you'll find a strange shaped device to the left and a linking book to the right side
You can have a look through the device if you like but don't touch the buttons yet
Walk towards the linking book and get yourself linked to a room full of great paintings
And these aren't ordinary paintings but also great hints how to solve some of the puzzles in this Age
The most important paintings are the next
Painting After you link back to the Age you have to adjust three devices corresponding to these three images
Click on the image to enlarge to have a better view
Painting Later on you have to cross a tile floor corresponding to this image to open a secret passage
Note the red dot on the right side
That's your starting point to cross the tiles
Click on the image to enlarge Painting These three images are very important
Notice the D'ni numbers and the rotating images above
You'll need this to determine the correct order of pushing buttons at a control panel at the end of this Age Painting This one got me stuck for hours
The solution was very simple however Click on the image to enlarge Painting Here you can see the corresponding number for every symbol on the panel
Click to enlarge When you examined this room walk to the linking book on the pedestal and link back to the platform
Now look through the device
Look at the intern pattern
Now look at painting in the room you where just a few moments ago
You should set the inner pattern corresponding to the top image
You can change the intern pattern by pressing the buttons in the correct order
For this first device the correct order of pressing the buttons is the left button times the center button time and the right button times
Now the intern pattern must look exactly like this The correct intern pattern Hey now you have set it alright but nothing happens
That's correct you need to set another two of these devices in the correct way to get something happening
Climb down the platform
Go to the left and leave this area via the stairs at the right side just besides the gap in the floor
Keep on walking passed the arch with light attached to it
Go through the circular door
At the intersection go to the left
Walk towards the platform and climb up the first stairs
Go to the right and press thesecond Journeyat the wall of the platform
Walk back towards the stairs you just climbed up
Don't climb down but proceed further around the platform
In the niche next to the next stairs you'll find another Journey stone
Jump to the Journey stone and click on the image to get yourself linked to another balcony at D'ni City
Enjoy the view and link back to Relto
Take the purple book from the book case and click on the Journey sign
Walk around the platform once more towards the niche where you just found the Journey stone
This time climb up the stairs to the platform
Walk towards the device
Now look through this second device
Look at the intern pattern
Now have another look at painting in the room you where just a few moments ago again
You should set the inner pattern corresponding to the center image
For this second device the correct order of pressing the buttons is the right button times
Now the intern pattern must look exactly like this and again
Turn around and walk towards the stairs leading down
Climb down the stairs
In the distance you'll see the third device waiting for you
Walk towards the device Now look through this third device
Look at the intern pattern
Now have another look at painting in the room you where just a few moments ago once more
You should set the inner pattern corresponding to the bottom image
For this third device the correct order of pressing the buttons is the left button times the center button times and the right button times
Now the intern pattern must look exactly like this and for the last time
This time something is happening
While you are still looking through the device you'll notice that in the distance something is moving aside
Now walk passed the device and notice that in the distance is a device looking similar to this device
Walk passed that device and enter the hidden door that you just opened
Exit this hallway through the opposite door
Press the blue button
Turn around and re enter the hallway
Walk towards the closed door and press thethird Journey
Turn around and exit the hallway
Walk onto the balcony at the end of the corridor
Turn to the right and walk down until you reach the five balconies with a blue button on each and every balcony
Now look at painting in the room with all paintings
Notice that there are five blue dots at the left side of the painting
Also notice that button and from top to bottom are lit
These represent the five buttons on the balconies
Last but not least notice the red dot at the right side of the painting
This represents the starting point of stepping on the tiles
So on your way down press the second third and fifth blue button
Now walk all the way down but make sure you stay on the outer rim of the floor
Turn to the right and keep on walking on the outer rim until the angel of the camera changes
You'll see what I mean with that
Turn around and walk a little bit back until the angel of the camera changes again
Have a good look at the outer rim and notice a little more bright part on the outer rim
This is your starting point indicated with the red dot on painting number
Walk towards that brighter part and the angel of the camera changes again
Now you're standing in front of a dark pattern of the tile floor
Walk across the dark pattern on the tiles to the center of the room
Be sure not to step on any bright part of the tiles
When you've done this correctly the path you just walked will sink
This is the correct path The correct path just sunk down
Turn around and walk down towards the just revealed door
Go through the door and climb the stairs
No need to push the blue button
If you press the button it will reset the tile floor puzzle
So you better leave it alone
Keep on walking until you are standing in the area with the purple lit lake
Turn to the left and keep on walking until you reach the crevice
Notice that there's laying something on the ground in the distance
So run jump over the crevice and pick up the Relto page
Click on the image to add it to your linking book
Turn around and run jump back over the crevice
Turn to the right and climb up the stairs
You are facing a huge pyramid now
Walk towards the right side of the pyramid and go around the corner
Halfway the pyramid turn to the left and jump into the niche
Turn to the left and press thefourth Journey
Walk back to the entrance of the pyramid
Climb up the stairs to enter the pyramid
Climb up the small center stairs and press the blue button
This will lit the room
Turn around and climb down the center stairs
Turn to the left and climb down the little stairs at the right side of the center stairs
Turn to the right and walk all the way around the room walking the outer rim of the floor
So don't step on the floor tiles
When you walked all the way around climb up the little stairs
Climb up the center stairs again and press the blue button once more
The tiles will lit blue now
Step down the center stairs turn to the left and climb down the little stairs at the right side of the center stairs
Be sure not to step on the floor tiles again
Because first you have to know the correct path
The correct path is to step from one tile to another with a mushroom image on it
So the correct path across these tiles is The correct order to step on the tiles
When you stepped on the correct tiles the last one turns out to be an elevator which takes you down
When the elevator stops just get out or it will take you up again
Leave the blue button alone
If you press it it will reset the puzzles you just solved and by that there will be no way back
Walk through the corridor
At the right wall near the exit press thefifth Journey
Turn to the left and enter the next room
When you enter the room turn to the left and step on the little platform with the levers so you are facing the center of the room
In front of you there are four pillars sunk in the floor
Your goal is to raise the correct pillars by pulling the levers in the correct order
The blue button at the right side will reset the pillars
Number the levers from to from the left to the right
Pull the fourth lever times to bring the last pillar into the highest position
Pull the third lever times to raise the third pillar into the last but highest position
Pull the second lever time to raise the second pillar a little
Now walk towards the pillars and climb all the way to the top and press thesixth Journey
Turn to the left and climb the stairs all the way down
At the bottom pull the lever to open a secret door
Now you are back in the room with the little control panel
Push the blue button to reset the pillars
Step behind the levers once more
Explanation Some gamers asked me how I solved the next puzzle
I must admit that I studied painting in the room with the paintings for hours
First I thought that the rotating ring would give the correct order of pulling the levers
Dead wrong
It is far more simple
Notice that the four rectangles on the image represent the four levers
Also notice that these four rectangles have different colors from the left to the right red white green and blue
Four rectangles
But there are only three numbers on the rotating ring with different colors corresponding with the rectangles
Also notice that all these D'ni numbers are between and
That can't be a coincidence After having noticed that I concluded that with each and every rectangle there is one number missing
You learned the D'ni numbers in the brown book at Relto in the right book case
When you study all colored numbers on the rotating ring you'll see Red the D'ni numbers and
So number is missingWhite the D'ni numbers and
So number is missingGreen the D'ni numbers and
So number is missingBlue the D'ni numbers and
So number is missing So the correct order to pull the levers is lever one time lever two times lever three time and lever four times
Sopull lever one time lever two times lever three time and lever four times
Now look what is happening
Isn't that amazing
Climb all the way to the top once more and climb up the steel ladder
Enter the next corridor
Leave this blue button alone too
Walk all the way to the end of the corridor until you are facing some sort of room up in the sky
Be careful not to fall down from the edge
Turn to the left and carefully walk all the way up towards the room up in the sky
Before climbing up the room itself step on the little platform with some sort of device at the right side
Examine the device
Note that it has six buttons
Also note that there are symbols above each and every button
I'm sure they will remind you of painting back in the room with the D'ni numbers and the rotating images above
Now you quot only quot have to figure out the correct order to push the buttons by the images above the buttons
Please don't shoot me because this is quiet o long explanation
Explanation The solution to this puzzle is based on the same principle as the solution to the levers in the pillar room
As the same in that puzzle the most important thing is which numbers are missing
Because of all the symbols and because there are six buttons it's all a little complicated
First of all you have to determine which numbers are present at each button and with that which numbers are missing with each button
Number each button from the left to the right from to
These are the numbers that are present above each button button and button and button and button and button and button and so the missing numbers are button and button and button and button and button and button and As you can see there is the D'ni number on the first button
This means that the first button has to be pressed the first
Thank God for that
So you can remove that button from the list
Now remove the first button number from the other missing numbers of the other buttons
That gives you the next missing numbers button and button and button and button and button Notice that button is the only button with one missing number now
And this number happens to be number
So now you know that the sixth button has to be pressed as the sixth button
So this brings you to the still incomplete order of pressing the buttons
Now that you found this out simply remove the sixth button number from the other missing numbers of the other buttons
That gives you the next missing numbers button and button and button and button Notice that button is the only button with one missing number now
And this number happens to be number
Now you know that the fifth button has to be pressed as the second button
So this brings you to the still incomplete order of pressing the buttons
Now that you found this out simply remove the second button number from the other missing numbers of the other buttons
That gives you the next missing numbers button button and button and Notice that button is the only button with one missing number now
And this number happens to be number
Now you know that the second button has to be pressed as the third button
So this brings you to the still incomplete order of pressing the buttons
Now that you found this out simply remove the third button number from the other missing numbers of the other buttons
That gives you the next missing numbers button button and Notice that button is the only button with one missing number now
And this number happens to be number
Now you know that the third button has to be pressed as the fourth button
button
So this brings you to the still incomplete order of pressing the buttons
Now that you found this out simply remove the fourth button number from the other missing numbers of the other buttons
That gives you the next missing numbers button Notice that button is the only button with one missing number now
And this number happens to be number
Now you know that the fourth button has to be pressed as the fifth button
button
So this brings you to the complete order of pressing the buttons
Okay okay
I admit you could have determined this last button also because it was the only remaining button
But I just wanted to show the whole story of missing and remaining numbers
I hope you're still with me but I really couldn't find a better way to explain this one
So the correct order of pressing the buttons is and After you pressed the buttons in this order you'll see that a door opens at the room up in the sky
So now walk all the way up to that room
Be careful again not to fall down
Go through the opened door and climb down the stairs
Next to the dead body is a note
Pick it up to read it
Turn to the left and walk towards the back wall
Jump on the wooden crates and keep on jumping towards the wall and press theseventh Journey
Jump down until you are standing on the floor again
Have a look at the linking book on the pedestal
It's a linking book to the room with all the paintings
No need to go back there it would just be a waste of time
Exit the room by climbing up the stairs
Go back to the little platform with the device
Go and stand in front of the device
Turn around and face the door in the distance where you entered this area
Walk straight on to the end of the platform and turn to the left
There in the distance you'll see your next goal another Journey door
Also notice a big pipe beneath the platform leading to that door
Jump down on that pipe and walk all the way to the end
Be careful again not to fall down
At the end turn to the right and jump down the platform near the Journey door
Walk towards the door and press the hand sign
Enter the room and walk straight ahead into the darkness until you'll hear Yeesha again
After she finished wait a second until the figure on the wall stops glowing
Touch the hand sign on the wall
This will make the totem disappear
Jump down form the ledge into the darkness
You'll end up at Relto once more
See what happens to the Kadish Tolesa pillar
A better proof that you finished this Age couldn't exist
Now enter the house and take the fourth red book from the book case
Open it and click on the image to go to
The Eder Kemo amp Eder Gira Age Turn around and notice two little geysers and between them a large geyser with a lid attached to it
Turn to the right and walk towards the large stand alone geyser
Kick the pedal to close the lid
Turn to the left and climb up the path
Turn to the right
Walk towards the first vase shaped plant next to the big rock
Carefully walk to the side of the path and look down
You'll see a very small ledge beneath you
Carefully step down the path onto that ledge
Turn around and press thefirst Journeyof this Age
Now turn around and notice another small platform with a geyser beneath you
Your next goal is to land on that platform without falling into the hot glowing lava
The best way to do this is to line up with that platform and stand with your back against the wall
Do one step forward and jump
On the platform kick the lid to close the geyser
Turn around and make a run jump to the next area
Close both geysers
Remember this place with the two geysers because you have to come back later here
Walk up the path and go to the right
Cross the stone bridge over the ravine
Follow the path and close the next geyser
Turn to the right and jump down to end up at the area where you started
Walk towards the opened big geyser and step on it
Now you know what the closing of the geysers is good for
By closing all of them the pressure will rise to much
By that all geysers will be opened
By closing all the geysers but one the only opened geyser will have power enough to blow you away
Because this is the only opened geyser now you will be blown away up to a small ledge
Press thesecond Journey
Jump down from the ledge
Now head back to the place with the two geysers you closed a while ago
Open the one nearest to the back wall
Return to your starting point and close the other geyser
Head back to the place with the two geysers once more
This time step on the opened geyser to get blown away to another area
Follow the path all the way until you reach the area with the waterfall and the lake
At the end of the path you'll find a linking book to Eder Gira at the right side
Leave it alone for now
Look around and notice a large bridge shaped rock crossing the river
Pan a little more to the left and notice another huge rock at the opposite side of the river
Walk towards that rock and cross the river
Walk towards the waterfall
Halfway there you'll pass another small rock
Examine it to find out it contains a Journey stone
Leave it alone for now but remember it is here you're going to need it later
Now walk all the way to the end of the path to end up behind the waterfall
Go into the cave behind the waterfall
It's pitch dark in there
At the very right end and at the very left end of the cave you'll find some sort of generator
Switch both of them on by pressing the lid to get some more light
Near the exit towards the waterfall you'll find some sort of buoy
Push it into the water and shove it all the way to the river
You should place it into the river next to the big rock
Later on you are going to need this as a bridge to cross the river dry footed
You'll learn why in just a few minutes
This is a good place to make your bridge
Walk to the linking book
Link yourself to Eder Gira
Walk down the path until you reach the huge rock sticking up at your right side
Walk towards that rock and press thethird Journey
Turn to the right and walk towards the little cabin
Get passed the right side of that cabin and walk until you're facing the rock wall
Turn to the right
Walk all the way to the end and press thefourth Journey
Head back to the path
Turn to the right and follow the path
At the right intersection you'll see another Journey door
Leave it alone for now but remember it's here
Keep on following the path and go passed the tunnel
At your right side and on your left side you'll see big brain plants
Keep on following the path to the left
In the distance you'll see big puffing plants
Climb down the stairs
Turn to the right and walk to the left side of the cabin
Turn around and press thefifth Journey
Walk towards the tunnel passed the puffing plants
Just in front of the tunnel head to the left and climb up the tunnel

There's something laying on the cliff over there
Turn to the left and walk halfway down the tunnel
Line up with the rock standing between you and the cliff
Make a run jump to that rock and jump on the cliff
Pick up the Relto page and click on the image to add it to your linking book
Jump down from the platform
Turn to the right and climb up the stairs towards the brain plants
On top of the stairs turn to the left and climb up the stone wall
Walk towards the lamp on top of the wall and press thesixth Journey
Jump or climb down the wall and walk back towards the stairs
Walk into the right area with the brain plants
Walk through the field of brain plants to find yourself a flying cloud of fireflies
Walk through the cloud of fireflies a few times to get some of them
Before you are going further you should know something about these fireflies
First of all they hate water
As soon as you are touching water or water is touching you the fireflies will be gone at once
When you run or jump more then once the fireflies will be gone as well
Your goal is to get back to Eder Kemo with these fireflies to lighten up some dark tunnels at the cave near the waterfall
So now you have to go back there without getting wet and without running or jumping
So when you got some fireflies gathered around you walk back towards the stairs and towards the tunnel passed the puffing plants
Walk through the tunnel and cross the water to the next cave
If you are surprised by a thunderstorm all the fireflies will be gone
In that case you have to collect some new ones
Enter the cave and link yourself back to Eder Gira
When you arrive there be careful with that geyser in front of you
Why
Because from time to time it spits steam and steam is wet
Walk towards the river and cross it dry footed across your own made bridge the buoy
Walk to the end of the path towards the waterfall
Line up with the cave
Now you can make only one jump step into the cave without the fireflies leaving you
Walk to the left side of the cave and step into the dark tunnel
It's good you brought those fireflies around because it's pitch dark inside the tunnel
Walk through the tunnel until you enter another generator room
Switch it on by pressing the lid
Turn to the right and pull the lever next to the door
Enter the next room
Step out into the water passed the waterfall
Walk to the left and enter the next cave behind the other waterfall
Here you'll find another two buoys
Drop them both into the water
Step into the water and push both buoys over the edge into the lake below
Now make another bridge by using the buoys at the entrance of the cave
You have to stash them at the spot where you jumped into the cave before
After you placed the buoys see if you can walk from the path into the cave without getting wet footed and without jumping
The correct way to stash the buoys
When you are absolutely sure about that walk to the linking book and link back to Eder Gira
Walk back to the brain plants and get yourself some fireflies again
Go through the tunnel passed the puffing plants and enter the next cave
Link back to Eder Kemo
Walk across your own made bridge across the river and walk across the bridge you just made at the entrance into the cave behind the waterfall
Enter the dark tunnel once more
In the generator room turn to the left and enter another dark tunnel
Follow the tunnel until you are standing outside the tunnel
Follow the path around the cliff until you are standing in front of the gap high above the little waterfall
You can do only a one step jump across the gap without losing your fireflies
So line up with the opposite side and make that one step jump
Follow the path into another dark cave
Go to the left and walk into the circular room
Find the generator and switch it on by pressing the lid

You'll end up at Relto once more
See that all four totems will raise
A better proof that you finished all Ages couldn't exist
Congratulations
You just finished Uru Ages Beyond Myst
Just kidding
Somehow you'll have the feeling that things aren't finished yet
That's correct
Remember that Yeesha just told you that you have to bring back what is taken
If you wonder what this might mean it's easier said than done
You have to bring back all four totems you just gathered onto Relto
I suggest you do this in the same order as you gathered them
So enter the house and take the second orange book from the book case once more

Walk towards the device with the blue button at the left side of the room

Now you have to adjust the symbols on the plate of the device in the order you just visited the four Ages
The correct order of the symbols is the Teledahn symbol on top the Gahreesen symbol at the bottom the Kadish Tolesa symbol at the left and the Eder Gira symbol at the right
So it should look like this All symbols set in the correct way Note these symbols where the same with me all the times and every time I played the game
I'm not sure if this is the case with you too
So if the symbols on the floor with the four ages were different you have to change these four symbols on the plate in the corresponding way of course
Press the blue button
If Yeesha disappears in a few seconds you didn't set the symbols correctly
In that case try again
When you set the symbols correctly Yeesha will pop up once more with a long story
At the end of the story Yeesha offers you another linking book
Touch the linking book in her hands
