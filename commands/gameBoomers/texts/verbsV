Before the War The Kingdom of Valhalla is currently ruled by the Great King Garamond a natural leader strong and fair minded who is cherished by the people of the land
Garamond is happily married and has a year old son called the little Prince of Valhalla who stands next in line for the throne as stated by Valhalla law
All was well within the kingdom except for an apparent jealousy harbored by the Lord of Infinity who is Garamond's younger brother
Infinity confused and often misunderstood always believed he should have been king instead of his brother
The Bishop of Valhalla approached King Garamond with rumors that Infinity was plotting to kill him
And that he had overheard Infinity chanting quot You are not my brother you are an obstacle to my destiny and so you will die quot Garamond could not ignore this threat which would have normally resulted in execution
But as Infinity is his own flesh and blood he ordered Infinity to be imprisoned within the Servants Hall under the watchful eyes of his trusted sorcerer
So whilst Valhalla sleeps Infinity begins his quest of hatred in which murder is the ultimate goal
Episode The Servants Hall In the Servants hall you will find yourself immersed in the magical history of the great castle
For here lie the tombs of court wizards from ages past
Each one possessing his own puzzling story which you must unravel if you are ever to escape But there is one wizard who reigns still and it is he which poses the greatest challenge

Only the wizard Greylim stands between you and your escape from imprisonment in the Servant's Hall

Cheats TypeWILDEBEESTEwhile playing
The following keys can be used Level Startup Menu Before every game a menu appears to allow you to set up the game as you prefer
Use the cursor keys up down to move between options left right to change the option to select the mode difficulty level
Controller and preferred shot type inertia or no inertia shots fired with inertia have your speed of motion forward backward left and right imparted to them shots without inertia will fly straight forward
The Graphics mode and sound selections can also be made here
The choice is yours
Players who have never played Vaxine before can use PRACTICE mode
Here the enemy cells never attack your bases so there is no time pressure
Use this mode to practice moving and firing until you are skilled enough to try the main game
Players who have mastered the first few rounds may prefer to select ADVANCED mode which starts the game off at level
Playing the Game Vaxine starts on a checkerboard grid upon which the whole game takes place
It is easiest to move around this grid using a mouse but you can use a joystick or keyboard if you prefer
The object of the game is to survive each level by destroying all enemy cells which appear before they bond together and destroy all of your base cells which appear as half domes on the floor of the grid
The game ends if all of your bases are destroyed or if one of your three ammo streams reaches zero
To destroy enemy cells shoot at them using the left mouse fire button BUT you will only destroy a cell if you hit it with a shot of the SAME COLOR
How do you know which color shot you are about to fire
Look at the ammo readout at the top of the screen it shows how many shots of the currently selected color you have left
It changes color by clicking the RIGHT mouse button or pressing the SPACE BAR
You have three different shot colors to choose from
STATUS LINE At the top of the screen are a number of items that provide essential information
On the top left is your score in the center is the ammo bar described above and to the right are two numbers
THe first of these shows the number of enemy cells in the currently selected color which are on the grid
The second shows the total number all three colors of bases remaining you begin with nine
AMMO RECHARGING If you shoot any enemy cell with the wrong color shot it will not be destroyed and will continue its evil business
However the resulting energy reaction creates a star which bounces on the spot three times before disappearing
If you shoot this star you will gain more ammo shots if shot with the SAME color cell only shots if shot with a DIFFERENT color cell
Nothing comes free though if the star disappears without being shot you will lose five shots of that color
If you fall low on ammo in the middle of a level you MUST recharge your ammo levels in this way if any one of your ammo levels fall to zero then you cannot possibly defend your bases properly and the game is automatically over
THE STAR TREE To make life slightly easier on the ammo front there is a short quot grace quot period at the start of every level
This is shown by a timer at the top right of the screen counting down to zero
Immediately in front of you is a star tree a source of free ammo to help you through the level
Just pick off the stars one by one
Stars shot with the same color scores points and yields extra shots of ammo
Stars hit with a different color shot scores points and extra shots
Remember that as soon as the timer reaches zero the quot grace quot period is over and the bad guys will start to appear
THE ENEMY CELLS Nasty evil things with only one aim in life to bond together in groups of three or more seek out one of your perfectly innocent base cells and suck the life from them to make more of their own kind
Try to destroy enemy cells before they even join together they are harder to hit when they're joined by strings and even harder to hit when bouncing around one of your bases just prior to destroying it
To help you know what they are up to behind your back we've included sampled sound effects to warn you whenever they Materialize Rising siren sound Join together Slurp sound Attack one of your bases Low resonance sweep sound In addition to the normal enemy cells later levels feature two additional species HATCHERS appear as three differently colored cells bonded together
When any one of them is shot the Hatcher splits up into a whole mess of individual cells
Worse still if you haven't located and destroyed a Hatcher after a period of time it explodes of its own accord and makes even more cells than if it had been shot
SPITTERS will also appear if you take too long finishing a level
Spitters look like flattened balls that roam around on the floor of the play area and can only be shot by positioning yourself so that one of your shots lands on top of the spitter
Sounds easy but wait till you try it
No sneaky waiting until continuously making stars
Spitters as the name suggests rome the grid spitting out new enemy cells from time to time
The longer you take the more spitters appear and the more enemy cells each one of them will produce
PSYCHIC RADAR Another useful way of locating enemy cells is with the radar function
Periodically you will see a word appear on the grid ahead of you
This message is an indicator of the direction ahead back left or right of the closest cell whose color matches the shot type you are using
This particular radar system also assumes that there are times when you won't want to be bothered with it for example when you are battling with an eight ball cluster
So it only shows up when it thinks you are lost
It decides this by seeing how long it's been since you last moved the mouse joystick or pressed a key so if you need any help wait for a second or so and it will appear
THE PORTAL When moving around the grid every so often you will see solid black slabs emerge from the ground or retract back into the ground
These are portals
If you move through a portal when you emerge on the other side everything will have frozen
You can move around the grid freely but all the enemy cells stars fragments of explosion and so on are suspended in mid air
This state of affairs continues until either the timer reached zero or you fire a shot
This is so that if things are going terribly wrong somehwere you can use a portal to suspend action until you've located the trouble spot
Naturally there's a price to be paid for this
Everytime you use the portal the enemy cells get meaner as if the action had been shifted up a level
So if you use a portal twice on level three the aggrestion of the enemy cells will be that of level five
DNA STRINGS Another weapon which can be used in the fight against disease and destruction is the DNA STRAND
To fire a DNA strand using a mouse hold down the right button and press the left button using a joystick press and hold down the fire button
With every press a shot is fired attached by elastic to the previous one
If you pause too long or let go of the right button the string of cells you have fired will be released and wander off around the grid
The advantage of these strands is that they appear to the enemy as quot one of their own quot Every time an enemy cell bonds to the string it is destroyed along with the leader cell until the string is used up
There are two disadvantages to using DNA strings They cost FIVE TIMES as much as normal shots ie
five units gone from the ammo readout
They have no intelligence of their own they merely wait to be approached by an enemy cell
So you must decide when it is worth launching them
SAVED AGAIN Through the miracles of modern science your job has been made slightly easier by virtue of the fact that at the beginning of every fifth level all of your bases are restored and you will have the opportunity to increase your ammo levels in the quot Shooting Stars quot sequence
In this bonus level dozens of ammo storing stars swirl onto the screen in front of you
Get as many of them as you can with the same color shot preferably for maximum ammo top up and then continue on CONTROL SUMMARY CONTROL FIRE CHANGE AMMO FIRE DNA MOUSE LEFT BUTTON RIGHT BUTTON Hold down RIGHT BUTTON press LEFT BUTTON JOYSTICK BUTTON A BUTTON B Press and hold down OR SPACE BAR FIRE BUTTON KEYBOARD ENTER SPACE BAR A Prolonged Press of the RETURN key
In addition press quot P quot to pause SPACEBAR to continue Press ESC to quit game back to title screen
Press F while in the game or at the title screen to return to DOS
SCORING Each enemy cell points Each cell in cluster points Star shot with same color points and extra shots Star shot with different color points and extra shots Hatcher points Spitter points Bonus for each remaining base after every level points per base PLAYING TIPS Levels one and two are relatively easy because there are only a few enemy cells not enough to attack your bases
The Spitters will not appear for a long time
Use these levels to practice moving around the grid and shooting accurately
Spitters are very difficult to shoot because they stay on the ground and in the time it takes to line one up and destroy it several cells could have been released
On the higher levels they appear more quick and in greater numbers
Time is of the essence
When enemy cells attack a base you have a few seconds to try and destroy them
You have only got to hit one of them and all the others disperse back onto the grid as individual cells
Further into the game your ammo levels will become crucial so on the early levels it is worth amassing as much ammo as possible
A level will not end until your last shot has dissapeared
This feature can be exploited to shoot any stars remaining on the star tree at the end of a level

Versailles Walkthrough byDan KennedyFebruary Introduction Cryo rsquo s game Versailles A Game of Intrigue definitely puts the ldquo edu rdquo in edutainment
The game was primarily developed to recreate the look and feel of the palace during the reign of Louis XIV in the late rsquo s The level of detail in the palace rooms and grounds is fantastic although this detail comes at a price ndash play is restricted to narrow pathways within each location The gameplay almost feels like a secondary element to Versailles ndash there is a lot of running back and forth between locations and the puzzles although sometimes engaging are never difficult The game does have a great classical soundtrack if you rsquo re into that style of music
Let rsquo s face it ndash looking around is supposed to be part of the lure of this game My wife and I found it fun to recall our visit to the palace almost ten years ago Take your time and immerse yourself in the characters the music and the architectural splendour Look at the paintings and read the descriptions of the people and places And if all of this sounds tremendously boring I suggest looking elsewhere for your kicks
The Great Pamphlet Crisis of You play the game as Lalande a valet of the King rsquo s bedchamber The start of the game finds you meeting with Bontemps the First Valet de Chambre He reads to you from an incendiary pamphlet that has been left in the palace The anonymous author threatens the security of Versailles and the King Bontemps entrusts the investigation of this matter to you yes a rather dubious plot point You must complete the investigation over the next hour day or face the possible destruction of Versailles
The game is structured around the seven periods of the King rsquo s day from morning to night Act I Waking the Kingfinds several of the King rsquo s closest family members gathered in his bedchamber to greet him as he wakes
Gameplay begins in the King rsquo s Chamber You can read a description of each room by bringing up your inventory with a right click and clicking on the button on the far right You rsquo ll also note that by clicking on the question mark cursor on each character takes you to a description of that person this is handy since you don rsquo t get to know any of the characters well enough to recognize them by sight Click on the small blue arrow in the bottom right corner of the screen to return to the game
Movement is quite simple ndash the grey upright hand will change to a white pointing hand when you can move in a certain direction Once you rsquo ve read about the room and the characters here leave via the only door accessible to you to the right of the windows
The next room is the Bassano Antechamber There is a guard posted beside the door you just came through click on his head to converse with him the mouth icon signals that a conversation is possible with that character The guard will not allow you back into the King rsquo s chamber Note also the pictures on the wall ndash a click on each will show a close up of that painting and a second click will reveal the title and artist
Click on the painting above the fireplace and then click on the urns in the close up view to search them The second from the right contains a key ndash a click will place it into your inventory Click on the down pointing hand icon to back away from the picture
Fetch a sketch Several gentlemen are conversing in one of the corners of the room Click on either of their heads the ear shaped icon indicates you can listen in to hear their words Now exit the room via the door located to the left of the windows This takes you into the First Antechamber Le Brun First Painter to the King is admiring a painting hanging on one of the walls Once he stops speaking engage him in conversation
Le Brun is obviously unhappy and is looking vexed ndash point that out to him to learn that his sketches for today rsquo s work have been stolen He suspects his rival Mignard but has no proof Agree to look for the sketches as part of your duties for today ndash and Le Brun leaves to await your success in the Salon of War
Exit the First Antechamber via the doors in the far corner ndash you are whisked down a flight of stairs into a darkened room Click on the curtains to open them and light the room Now click on the second closet to the left of the window to open the doors and again on the fifth drawer from the top to reveal a pair of scissors Take the scissors and close the door again Now open the second closet door to the left of the stairs and open the sixth drawer from the top to reveal another pamphlet This one rather obliquely takes a shot at our friend Le Brun and mentions a message that will be revealed by combining a sketch with the colour that dominates the King rsquo s Salon
See the Light Place the document into your inventory and return through the First Antechamber to the Bassano Antechamber Now proceed through the doors to the right of the windows This transports you up a spiral staircase ndash at the top continue down a short corridor to a small room with a writing table and a trunk Use the scissors from your inventory to unlock the trunk and grab the paper inside Click on the table to get a close up and holding the paper from the trunk click on the candle rsquo s flame to reveal the secret message on the parchment lsquo The Hawk and the Little Birds rsquo You can also click on the inkwell ndash it spills across the paper on the desk ndash and take the paper into your inventory
Leave the room and return to the Bassano Antechamber ndash the doors to the King rsquo s Chamber are now open allowing you to enter once again Speak to the usher who has moved to another door in the Chamber ndash tell him you must report to Bontemps immediately and he will let you pass Act II From Rising to Councilnow begins showing the King conferring with his ldquo posse rdquo until it is time for Council The game returns with you in the King rsquo s Salon
Good Times with Bontemps Confer with the guard again ndash the King is in Council session and cannot be disturbed Flip around and listen in on the conversation about the rivalry between the artists Le Brun and Mignard Remember the anonymous note mentioning the colour of the King rsquo s Salon ndash the walls in here are beige with a lot of gold trim
Return to the King rsquo s Chamber and approach Bontemps who is standing by the left side of the bed He has an important errand for you ndash to inform the Marquise de Maintenon that the King will be working in her rooms in the afternoon Enter the Bassano Antechamber and proceed to the First Antechamber Now proceed through the doors on the right into the Guard Room There isn rsquo t much going on in here so exit the doors straight ahead and approach the guard standing in front of the doors ahead of you
The Marquise rsquo s guard will not let you deliver the message in person but he will deliver the message for you Attempt to leave this room and the game suggests showing a clue to the guard Return to the guard and show him Pamphlet A ndash he gives you another pamphlet that he has found this morning complete with some sort of number code at the bottom File this away in your inventory and return to the King rsquo s Chamber via the Guard Room First Antechamber and Bassano Antechamber
Speak to Bontemps again and show him what you rsquo ve found He basically tells you to keep looking Don rsquo t be concerned if your secret messages and pamphlets begin to disappear from your inventory ndash you will get summary documents later in the game that make the collection of these items unnecessary
Once you are finished with Bontemps click on the closet to the left of the bed to open the doors Grab a candle and place it in your inventory and snatch the large key from the shelf below Now return to the Bassano Antechamber Use the large key to open the two cabinets in this room The left one is empty but the right one contains a hellip gasp hellip sketch book Rifle through the sketches and close up the cabinets again
A Portrait of the Artist as a Fussy pants Leave the Bassano Antechamber via the door to the right of the fireplace and enter the Hall of Mirrors Apparently this is where the toadies of the King rsquo s court hang out while he rsquo s doing some work Listen in on the conversation that the Princesse de Conti pink dress is having with the stranger There rsquo s another conversation to eavesdrop on a cardinal and a woman in a purple and gold dress as you make your way along the Hall Enter the Salon of War at the far end of the hall of Mirrors
Turn to your left to see Le Brun waiting for his sketches Try and give him the sketches ndash he has a hissy fit claiming that they are not his work and gives them back to you Huh
Return to the King rsquo s Salon you can enter this room directly from the centre of the Hall of Mirrors where the Monseigneur accosts you about the sketchbook Let him know that you though the sketches were Le Brun rsquo s but the artist refused them Give him the sketches ndash he quickly determines that the top one is a planted forgery while the ones underneath are legitimate
Return to the Salon of War and give Le Brun the altered sketchbook He thanks you profusely and gives you the fake sketch to keep Now test the directions in the pamphlet by grabbing the sketch from your inventory and clicking on Le Brun rsquo s palette Pick up one of the brushes to the left and dip it in the gold coloured paint the only other choice available red is not present in the King rsquo s Salon Now click on the sketch above to reveal a new message ndash ldquo The Ducks and the Spaniel rdquo
Return to the Hall of Mirrors and speak with Bontemps who is standing to the left as you enter Show him the sketch ndash he is pleased at your progress but must attend the King as he leaves Council

To determine the correct order we must first find the maze rsquo s gazebo From the maze entrance take the following path Bad Case of Gas You should now be standing inside the gazebo
Engage the Duc de Maine in conversation ndash he babbles on about viewing the maze in the proper order Once he rsquo s finished back away from the gazebo one step and then return again immediately Speak to the brat again ndash now his belly is aching and he needs his medicine from the apothecary oh boy Apparently he rsquo s too proper to just let it rip

He is eternally grateful feeling better almost immediately Once he departs pick up the paper lying on the bench ndash a map of the maze your current position is marked with a blue circle
A Sort of Fable In order to sort the fable titles that Bontemps gave us we must compare his list with the map of the maze There are statues present in the maze ndash the roman numerals marked on the map indicate the order in which they should be visited Rearranging Bontemp rsquo s list we get II The Cock and the Diamond III The Cats and the Rats IV The Dragon and the File V The Fox and the Crane IX The Hawk and the Little Birds X The Frogs and Jupiter XII The Mouse the Cat and the Little Cock XV The Ducks and the Spaniel You must now visit each of the eight statues using the notes on the memorandum to select letters that will make up the extra special secret message from your enemy wouldn rsquo t it be easier for villains if they didn rsquo t leave us ANY hints

months have passed of hard work for the completion of the estate Hjalmar and Haraldsson walk the cliffs of Iceland
Many suspected Haraldsson knowing of his financial state of the death of Ingmar because Dyrholmar is rich and its closeness to the rich land of Vinland
Haraldsson did not worry about these as much as the danger he saw on the first day of their arrival when a dagger with a head of a wolf was found by his men in the ruins
While walking on the cliff men pushed Hjalmar and Haraldsson over the cliff killing Leif while Hjalmar fell on a ledge
Eldgrim appeared and warned Hjalmar

means both tray are equal weight gt means the left tray is heavier and lt indicates the right tray is heavier

Take isotopes and place it on left tray
Take isotopes and place it on right tray
Weigh by clicking on middle button

Place the remaining isotope evenly on the tray
Take the lightestKlipsgaal isotope
Alternative solution from manxman With isotopesto compare place on each side and compared leaving left
That identified which group of contained the lightest isotope
Then place on each side of the machine leaving remaining
The lightest was easily identified then
Shell at landing area Leap to snow covered area on the surrounding mountain
Combine isolated Klipsgaal isotope blue fruit measures of Essence of Klipsaggt Klipso' lightening agent
