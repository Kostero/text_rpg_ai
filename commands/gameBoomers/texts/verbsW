Warcraft Orcs and Humans Player s Guide Move three Knights one Archer and one Cleric Group A to the north east ofthe screen
Move a Catapult three Archers and one Cleric Group B to the south east ofthe forest then proceed clockwise round the forest until you find a road then headsouth to a bridge
Position the Archers on the bridge then line the Catapultdirectly behind the Archers and then the Cleric behind the Catapult
Move to the south of your village and place a Knight beneath the southernmostfarm
Move Group A south down the right hand side of the map until you meet anOrc warrior make sure your Knights lead the party
Attack the Orc with yourKnights and Archer and watch for the second Orc who approaches from thesouth
Now move Group A west and stop when a wall becomes visible wait to theeast of the wall your leading Knight should be positioned level with the north east corner of the wall
DO NOT line up your group parallel to the wall
Instead leavethem to the north or another group of Orcs will move in to attack
Next move the leading Knight south until he is level with the wall then sendhim back to the formation two Grunts and a Raider will approach
Attack withyour Knights and Archer and use your Cleric sparingly to heal if necessary
Take two Knights from Group A and move them to the mine located in thenorth east corner of the map then move them to Group B on the bridge
Use thelast Knight to destroy the top sections of the slave pen but make sure that theKnight does not move into the pen or on to the newly cleared spaces
Select the Knight and Archer from Group A and position them on the pathbetween the water and the wall
Also make sure your Cleric is clear of the rubble
Check on Group B it is probably under attack
Use your Cleric to heal yourtroops then when the Knights from Group A arrive position them as follows twoKnights and one Archer in the front line the Catapult flanked by two Archers inthe second line and the Cleric at the rear to heal
Return to Group A and use the Cleric to heal the Peasant closest to him thePeasants will now move as will an Orc attack force
Group the Peasants andmove them to the mine at the north east of the map using your Cleric to heal thePeasants as they escape starting with the very last one in the group
Send yourCleric to the mine as well using your Knight and Archer to protect the group Once clear leave your Knight and Archer to defend and focus on Group B
The bridge battle will be raging pretty ferociously so use the Cleric as muchas possible to heal your front line troops
Your Catapult should be effective intaking out large groups of Spearmen at a time
When things start to calm focus onthe mine
You should have found another mine to the top of the map in the very centre send your Peasants here to harvest the gold
Send any remaining survivors fromGroup A to the map in the north east and heal them with the Cleric there thensend the Cleric and the survivors back to your town
At this point a Spearman should attack your village from the south but theKnight you left there initially should defeat him with ease
Check on Group B andwhen its members are victorious send just the Knights back to defend the village Leave the remainder of Group B on the bridge
Yet another group of Orcs will attack your village from the south but anotherKnight and Cleric should be on hand to help defend
Again use your Clerics toheal your troops
You now have the opportunity to start building up an attack force with whichto overthrow the Orcs once and for all
Adopt your own tactics and strategies forthe final onslaught now that the complex bit has been successfully completed

Warcraft II Beyond The Dark Portal Cheats Tips and Tactics Warcraft II is very much a unit based game
It s in the training and use of unitsthat success or failure lies and in sometimes coming up with an unusualcombination that ll leave your opponent floored
So here s the complete run downon how to get the most from your fantastic army
It s organised unit by unit Where both sides have pretty much identical units they re covered together andwhere individual cases need explaining they are
Explained
Individually
Peons PeasantsYer bog standard Serfs their primary use is in collecting gold and lumber andbuilding things
If a fight occurs near them move them all away to safetyimmediately
Always try to keep your Peons behind other units
One of the moreuseful things that Peons do is repair
If one of your buildings is under attack instruct a Peon to repair it while the attack is going on
As long as you keep it onthe other side of the building from the attacker you ll find that it s perfectly safeand will seriously slow down the rate at which the attacker causes damage Indeed get two Peons repairing a building and you ll have made it practicallyindestructible
It s also possible to use this facility to speed up your building bysending Peons to repair a building under construction
Be warned though thiswill substantially add to the cost in both gold and lumber
Orc Grunts FootmenThese characters are your basic foot soldiers and you ll need a few of these at thestart of each level
As soon as you can though you should stop producing themand concentrate on some of theother more useful units
Trolls Elven ArchersThese are the missile units
In hand to hand combat they are quicklyoverwhelmed
Always keep them behind Grunts or Ogres Footmen and Knightsfor the Elves in battle
If you group them with these other units keep a fairlyeven mix
When you move to engage the enemy the Trolls or Archers will stop ata distance while the hand to hand specialists move in
In the case of the Trolls it s worth producing lots of these early on as later you ll be able to buyregeneration for them
Both Trolls and Elves should be upgraded vigorously
On later levels theybecome the best defence against the heavy aerial threat posed by Dragons orGryphons
A couple of well trained units can be very effective especially if youdistract the aerial invader with some cannon fodder
Get a Footman or Grunt andrun him around underneath the flying nasties
He ll probably survive for quite awhile and your missile chuckers will benefit from the easy target practiceprovided
Catapult BallistaMore destructive than the Trolls or Archers these are also missile only units They re very slow however and in defence you should always keep them backfrom any front line areas only bringing them forward when an enemy appears Their greatest use comes when attacking because of their exceptional range
Withreasonably careful positioning you ll be able to take out enemy towers withoutany danger to the catapult
When attacking with these units always keep somefoot soldiers nearby
If the catapults come under attack move this squad in to dealwith the attackers
Then pull them out again and let the catapults do the majordamage
Goblin Sappers Dwarven Demo SquadSurprisingly effective these units self destruct when instructed
You ll find thattwo of these will take out most enemy buildings
Like the Peons though theyshould be kept away from all combat
Keep them in some safe corner until youneed them
They can also be used to carve routes through to gold mines or forestsby blowing up mountains
It can be well worth using a couple of these to make ajourney for your Peons shorter giving you quite a significant long term timeadvantage
OgresOgres are very tough hand to hand fighters
As soon as you can stop producingGrunts and switch to these
Later on you ll be able to turn them into Ogre Magesand research spells for them
However if money is tight this is one thing that canquite easily be dropped from your schedule
The Death Knights get much moreeffective magic and the Ogres don t really get all that much tougher when youmake them into Mages
Keep a careful eye on your Ogre units which tend to berather head strong and are likely to charge off after retreating enemy units whenyou don t really want them too
KnightsKnights are great shock troops and as with Ogres as soon as they becomeavailable you should concentrate on producing them instead of Footmen
Unlikethe Ogres though they get great magic when upgraded to Paladin status and it swell worth spending the money on research
Two spells in particular are hugelyuseful
First Healing it can make sense to keep your Knights with healing safelyout of the way and just bring units to them to have them healed
This is especiallyuseful when combined with Gryphons
The other invaluable power that Knightsget is exorcism
Use that to pick off any Death Knights you come up against
MageLike the Death Knight the Mage should be kept out of close fighting
The Magehas great destructive capability with its Fireball spell just be careful there are nofriendly units in the line of fire
The other great spell in the Mage s armoury isInvisibility
Cast it on a Peasant and get him to walk calmly into your enemy s lairand build a Guard Tower
Or cast it in on a Peasant in combination with FlameShield and get him to wander unnoticed among your enemy s army wreakinghavoc as he goes
Or cast it on some Dwarves and get them to blow something up You ll have great fun with Invisibility the only drawback being that it doesn tfool death Knights so make sure that your paladins have exorcised them first
Goblin Zeppelin Gnomish Flying MachineWith no combat ability whatsoever these units are just spotters
They re veryhandy for sussing out enemy strengths and weaknesses but their major use comeswhen the enemy produces submarines
Add one of these to any naval group youcreate and they ll be able to spot the otherwise invisible subs allowing you toattack them without being spotted
Death KnightThe Death Knight is an awesome creature but not really suited to hand to handcombat
Try to keep them slightly away from the fighting and particularly anyPaladins
Probably their greatest power is to animate the dead
With the judicioususe of a couple of Death Knights attached to any raiding party you can turn all theenemies you defeat into skeleton soldiers at no financial cost
As the enemy getsweaker you get stronger Also very effective is the Whirlwind but only when cast on very dense areas ofthe enemy s defences
Unholy Armour is great if you give it to a Sapper unit andthen send it now invulnerable to blow up an enemy building or army
It certainlygets rid of pesky Mages quickly
Dragon Gryphon RidersThese great aerial beasts are the finest weapons available
No longer do you needto build ships to transport your men around
Now you can just fly somewhere andattack it
Their only real disadvantage is that if grouped they tend to destroyfriendly units with over enthusiastic fireballs and even each other but keep themas loners and they won t go far wrong
Naval TacticsThe Troll Destroyer and Elven Destroyer are fast manoeuvrable ships and stilluseful when they ve been superseded by the bigger and more powerful OgreJuggernauts or Battleships
The larger ships are much slower and take longer torespond so always keep a blend of different ships in a naval group
That wayyou ll be able to react more quickly to any threat
The Destroyers are also capableof hitting flying opponents which makes them indispensable at sea
The Submarines make a great addition to any naval group as well but can also beused very effectively as raiders in groups of two or three especially if combinedwith an aerial spotter to watch out for any Towers or flying creatures that arecapable of noticing them
Sending Subs out in advance of a large navy is a greattactic as you can pick off enemy ships before they ve seen you
One final piece of advice
Towers are very effective against naval units andyou ll nearly always lose ships when attacking them
But you can use a Transportinstead
Put three Footmen into the Transport and rush the enemy Tower
Landthe Transport as close as possible to the Tower then release your Footmen whowill attack it and remain safe because the Towers can only attack units at adistance
Move the Transport out of harm s way until the job s done and thensend it back in to pick up your heroes Sim CitadelThe layout of your buildings can have a crucial effect on the outcome of anyattack so take some time to think about where you place them
Always make surethat your Peasants have as short a route as is possible to the Town Hall or LumberMill for instance and build Barracks as near to the front as possible so that yourtroops have less distance to travel into battle
Towers are an extremely effective form of defence particularly as they can beeasily repaired when damaged
What s not so obvious is that they can also be veryhandy in an attack
Building a string of Towers behind enemy lines will certainlygive them something to think about
Although you can t build walls yourself you do have an option to create veryeffective barriers by using Farms
Farms are not crucial buildings and are prettycheap to produce
If you want to block off an area against repeated attacks builda wall out of Farms and then place Towers just behind it
The enemy will comealong and attack the Farms leaving you in peace to pick them off
Then when theattack s over repair your Farms
Using this tactic it s possible to just sit back andabsorb all that the enemy can throw at you until he s exhausted all his resources Keep an eye on how much gold is left in his mine by using your aerial spotter Filthy cheatThere is a quite splendid array of cheats for Warcraft II
These are just some ofthe more useful To use any of them press the enter key

Familiarize yourself with your new surroundings and start socializing and reading

First impressions are MOST important so when initiating a conversation for the first time with someone make sure you choose the right thing to say or locate the person later and apologize
Most conversations take place within the gambling room or sometimes other rooms some people will NOT agree to talk to you elsewhere
If you want to talk to a certain someone either go to their room and wait or ask them to meet you there
Talk to the Brazilian and choose Do I look that bad
exhaust all topics one cannot be discussed show him the secret sign he tells you to talk to Hacker he's the guy wearing black clothes a black hat backward of course amp sunglasses
The bells ring and you go to church and get some beating
Now you need to explore and talk to everyone and a LOT this is probably not the most efficient way to do the talking but it works so if you want a step by step talking guide go ahead Locate Hacker description above and choose As charming as a rattler
Locate the man wearing a matching pair of cyan shirt and pants and talk to him usually located in the gambling room meet Jake the radioman
Exhaust all options

Move the mouse over Walker's turned card to reveal what number lies underneath
Welcome to your nightmare your objective here is to get what is known as Pager's card or more correctly half of Pager's card but first you need to clean the gambler out of almost everything especially his gambler card
Don't worry about loosing all your betting items once the gambler chooses the C S M
model you AUTOMATICALLY win same goes to the gambler if he is left with one object as far as I know make sure you DON'T bet the screwdriver or at least get it back if you do since it's needed for later use
Some guidance rules for non blackjack players don't ask for a hit if you have or more since you'll probably get more than and automatically lose
You can also use the SAVE LOAD tactic to help you win meaning each time you win you save the game and each time you lose you load the last game you saved and try again thus not loosing
According to another theory of mine the first time the gambler shows you the half card you will not be able to win it lose once then go for it again this has not been proven
My method of winning is to keep on playing since I can't loose it all anyway till I get my winning streak and get the card
That said go on a winning streak and win half of Pager's card AND the gambler's card
Go to the toilets and talk to Sebastian show him the card and exhaust all options
Go to Rita's room talk to her exhaust new option are we having fun yet
Talk to Hacker exhaust all new options

Use the paper to help you solve this one or consult the following screenshot Click on the cabinet you are now in possession of BOTH halves find Hacker and talk to him
Take another stroll around then go back near the gambling room Jack will give you a note
Go to the preacher's room BUT before you enter make sure to SAVE your game
As soon as you enter the preacher's room the door shuts behind you and the air starts leaving
Look at the picture on the right side is a hidden switch use it to open the picture use the screwdriver on the metal cover to open it click on the disconnected wires twice to connect them in shape
Click on the fuse cap to open it then take the fuse use the C S M

After a short ride in the elevator click on the portal then click on the flow
The last puzzle to the best of my knowledge is to turn all the white crystals into color crystals each time you click a crystal you get transported to a different place with more crystals one click gives them color the next takes it away
It's not a hard puzzle and a few minutes of clicking everything white should solve this one
After that enjoy the end game sequence you deserved it especially after all those sliders

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
THE WARD A Walkthrough by Soren Andersen Personal Observations The jewel case sized booklet the manual starts with two sections the Ward Background Story and the Main Story
I found the mass of detail confusing but science fiction mavens who are more used to this sort of plot will in all probability comprehend it much better than I
At any rate read it a couple times to get some background
The rest of this booklet is used to present in detail the game's user interface this latter subject may also be found as a Microsoft Word document on game disk
In several instances there is more than one way to do what you want to do for example load or save games and one of these will usually turn out to be simpler
Not covered in the above manuals are method of playing options presented when beginning a new game Easy Normal and Demo
Place the cursor on each word to get an explanation
What is not stated is that you can switch from Normal to Easy by keying Ctrl Shift E apparently you cannot switch back
The Ward is quite a long game for one that is on only two CD's and it is about as nonlinear an Adventure game as you are likely to find
The graphics are quite good and game storage to all intents and purposes unlimited with adequate space for situation description and aided by thumbnails
This is to your decided advantage because there are many many opportunities to be destroyed so you must save often
A good share of these chances are the result of timed sequences a couple with visible countdown timers and others evident only when you are overcome
It is during these periods that the protagonist Walker rsquo s deliberate pace becomes frustrating at other times it is only annoying and there is no way to make him hurry
The first section of the game on the Moonbase is quite straightforward and linear but when you get to Mars the incessant moving and talking that you must do to force development as well as the tedious blackjack game can become rather wearying and I was tempted a couple times to give up but I hope that is not an impediment to other players because it is a pretty fair game if one overlooks these shortcomings accepts the premise and ignores the discontinuities
I found irritating the several instances in which the same item is designated by different names such as when positioning the cursor on it in place and then when in it is done in inventory
Be prepared for this oddity
In connection with the inventory I believe that it would be much easier to identify items were they not shown so dark this is exacerbated by the fact that they spin when the cursor is on them mdash which is fine mdash but if thin or narrow black items stop when edge on they are almost invisible
I found it interesting that it is only in a few videos that there is any spoken dialog the rest of the time mdash and there is a lot mdash it is not spoken but printed
Walker rsquo s is shown in white and others consistently have other colors which helps identify the speaker
Good idea
In the following walkthrough I tried not only to present explicit instructions on what moves to make but also in many instances why they are necessary
The appended maps especially that of the Mars Colony should prove quite helpful
And you should always keep in mind that this is an Adventure game so you must save often
Walkthrough NOTE The game opens with a long video of the Apollo XIX mission that is on the moon investigating unusual seismic activity
Lewis and Higgins are at the moon surface with the Lander module or in the Orbiter circling the moon it is not exactly clear about this
You David Walker are out with the Rover on the surface of the moon setting up instruments and making measurements
Lots of conversation between you the moon base the Orbiter and Houston before the Orbiter goes out of communication on the moon's dark side
Shortly thereafter an alien force destroys the Orbiter and the Lander with missiles and you are the only one left
Keep in mind throughout this walkthrough that the Fraction are on your side and the Controllers the Reptoids and the Greys maybe are your enemies
An explosion has rendered you unconscious and you have been captured
Your interface with the game begins with you regaining consciousness without your space helmet and in a compartment filled with many things so you must start exploring
Around your neck is a collar that you can't remove apparently a surveillance device in conjunction with the sphere floating above click on it
The collar in inventory is called a necklace
In the center of the compartment is a cabinet that when seen in closeup shows a screwdriver for you to pick up and put in inventory
There are a couple of dead bodies on cots one alien and one human perhaps this is a morgue
Nothing for you on the human but the alien has a card in his pocket that you need the screwdriver to remove
It is a medcard
Click on the glowing area on the wall with a red and green column on each side
It is a map of the moonbase where you are being held
Move your cursor over it and the various compartments will highlight click on any one of them and a legend appears across the top but you can't read it because it is in an alien script
Click on the legend sections and more alien script appears
Clicking on the section underlined in yellow takes you back out of the map you can also do this using a red movement arrow at screen bottom
In the second compartment from the left at the top the map shows a pulsing red that would be your position in this morgue compartment as you look at this map
There is a blueowhere you found the dead alien and a green for the dead human
There are more such indications in other compartments the blueo's are aliens and the orange diamonds are enemy drones that must be avoided
Pulsing ones are quot alive quot
Fig
is a screenshot of this map unfortunately in order to make it printable the colors had to be electronically reversed and some of the details such as aliens and robots are no longer so prominent but nevertheless you can use it to follow your progress as you move around the base
The map indicates three dead aliens in the passageway next to you
When you go to investigate a painful noise comes from the collar getting more intense the longer you stay away from the floating sphere
However you have time to examine the first of these aliens before being driven back by the noise and from next to his body you can get a security card
You can put this card in a slot in the red column to the left of the moonbase wall map whereupon the column turns green and the representing you on the diagram turns from red to green
Now when you move away from the sphere the collar is silent though it still emits a tracking beacon as you will find out
There was something else on that alien in the passageway a ring but it is tight on his finger and you can't get it off
On the floor next to him is an uncharged laser gun for your inventory
Farther down the corridor on the floor is another alien corpse from which you can get a ring with blue engraving
On the third alien corpse there is nothing
This corpse was thrown up on some cabinets by the explosion that presumably killed the three of them but fortunately only knocked you out
In the wall opposite him is a locked door but you can open it using the medcard
It leads to a medical laboratory
Lots of stuff in here but not much for you at least at this time
On either side of the door through which you entered are red sensors the one on the left will accept the medcard and open the door
The one on the right also accepts the card and then some faint blue markings appear on the screen immediately to the right of it
Click on this screen and a closeup of it appears showing a spaceship and a button touch screen
Click on the leftmost button and the spaceship turns out to be a robotic surgical instrument that drops down from the lab ceiling
You can play with these touch screen buttons to see what they do but after the first you need to click on the third to expose some blades and the last to lock them in place so you can break one off and place it in inventory
What to do with this sharp blade
Apply the medcard to the left door sensor to go back to the alien corpse in the passageway and use the blade to get the ring from his finger
This ring has an engraving on it identical to the blue one you got from the other dead alien but the color of this one is cyan
Back in the medlab go all the way to the right where there are five cabinets in the wall four closed and one open
Below the closed one on the right is a sensor into which you can put the medcard to light up a screen a closeup of the screen shows the indecipherable alien script
From the open cabinet you can get one at a time three capsules containing blood samples
In the foreground are three medical beds and a medical robot the red light on the latter indicating it is active
Go through the door to the left of the five cabinets where you will be in a biological laboratory mdash a biolab
In this room is a blue square right in front of Walker when he enters place the cursor on it to find that it is a microscope
Click on it to exhibit a closeup a globe in which may be seen floating another blood sample capsule and below it a bright quot light object quot
Below the globe are four smaller bars and one larger one
Use the smaller ones to move a pair of circles on the surface of the globe around to the lower right until they can be superimposed and become one then click on the larger bar to turn the circle red and the sample will float out of the globe
Place it in inventory and then click on the light object which after a short pause also goes into inventory where it is called a glowing lens
The room goes dark but the emergency lights come on shortly just wait
A door opens in the wall on the left beyond which can be seen laser flashes
Farther into the room is a long probe extending from the ceiling toward a low pedestal on which something is swirling
Putting the cursor on it labels it quot pulsating matter quot click on it and Walker calls it quot a hollow mass of live tissue quot
If you put it in inventory it is called a biocontainer
However for now leave it on the pedestal
You can look around this room but you will not find anything productive
Nothing more to do here at this time you will come back later
Leave through the door on the left use the medcard if you have to
Outside this door you are in a corridor in which an alien is in a laser battle with an unseen opponent which the moonbase map indicates is a couple of drones
When there is a pause in the shooting hurry across to a door on the opposite side
Be careful here it is your first opportunity to be killed
On the floor is another alien body and again when there is a firing pause retrieve a green engraved ring from it
In the wall by the new door is a control panel that will show a closeup when you click on it but it is too dark to make out the details
Apply the glowing lens that you took from the microscope then use the screwdriver to pry off the cover in the panel upper left keep at it it will come off after several attempts
Click on the blue bar underneath the cover so that all three bars are red
Below the bars are three sensors on which are faint insignia that match the engravings on the three rings that you have in inventory
Your task is to match a randomly established color sequence of the sensors with the rings
You do this by picking a ring from inventory and clicking it on a sensor putting the ring back in inventory and repeating with another ring on another sensor
You must complete the sequence within a quite short time set up by a timer in the panel
If time runs out start again
No ring colors are repeated and therefore there are six different sequences of the green blue and cyan rings GBC GCB CGB CBG BCG BGC Line up your choice of a ring sequence in inventory and by operation of the left and right mouse buttons you can select place and release the three rings before the timer runs out
What you are looking for is two green lines to appear at the bottom of the panel display so keep trying different sequences until that happens
When it does note the sequence
At this point the shooting alien will toss at your feet a red engraved ring which might be hidden by the inventory display
Pick it up
Now you must go through the same procedure of clicking rings on the three sensors but here the red ring is substituted for one of the rings that got the two green lines
Clearly this will take no more that three sequence attempts
When you have the correct one the door opens and you go through
However the alien loses his fight and gets killed so the drones he was fighting are free to come after you and therefore you mustimmediatelyclick on the sensor on the left of the door to close it and keep a drone from getting to you and ending the game unfavorably
You must be sure to note the ring sequence that opened the door as you will need it to open another
The compartment in which you now find yourself has a large screen display and console on the left wall and next to it is another moonbase map with its own console
Click on the latter and Walker will say that he sees a ring slot in it but you can't find it with your cursor
In the center of the room is what looks like a large gaming table but Walker thinks it is a holographic projector
At the end of this table is a cover and next to it a button or a bump depending on the place from which you view it
Click on it and the cover moves off to bring up a device that resembles a TV remote control but the game calls it a memorizer
All of the writing on it is in the alien script
Move on to the next compartment where you will find more displays and consoles and another projector but nothing with which to interact
A panel to the left of another door will open to let you move on into a long stone walled passageway with yet another door at the far end that opens as you approach it
Now you enter a large indistinct area with a luminous sphere suspended high above a circle on the floor and floating lower at shoulder height is a gray object that is called a plate when you run the cursor over it then a floating stone when you click on it and Walker moves to it
Click on it again and it morphs to a plate with symbols on it
Click on it a third time and you can place it in inventory yet it remains floating in front of Walker
Click on it once more and hold the mouse key down whereupon it morphs into a set of disks and triangles stuck together these are labeled tiles
Put them in inventory
Click on the engraving in the center of the floor circle and it appears full screen
You are now presented with the engraving puzzle
Here is a step by step solution The overlapping parts of the disks and triangles should be a close color match for corresponding sections of the stone plate diagram on the left
Click the crystal cone on the engraving
A long video ensues and at the conclusion two alien members of the Fraction appear
After the pyrotechnics that have just concluded in which Walker is given an implant he can now understand them and read their language
A long conversation ensues during which Walker is told things about himself that he did not know of the many things he is expected to do and his important responsibilities
For these reasons a copy of this conversation follows as a reference BRBL OKHL BLA TLA we don't want to hurt you we're on your side we don't want to hurt you don't know if you are already able to communicate with us but believe me we are not your enemies
wwhat
We don't have much time
You understand us because of the implant we installed in you while you were in touch with the Maker's Artifact
Now the only thing that you can do is protect what is inside you and reach Mars in a vessel alive
Mars
Yes
We expected you Ward
The Nexus told us that you would come
The Nexus
It's a code name of a man you'll have to find on Cydonia
It's a Reptoids base on Mars
A man
Who is he
There is no time to waste he is your connection Ward
You'll find him with this
What's this
A Communicator
Show it only to the Nexus
Why do you call me Ward
Because you are him
You are the Ward
No I am David Walker
That may be your name but have you felt it yourself the Technology knows your very core
Believe me it wouldn rsquo t react if you were not the real one
The real one
Real what
You'll find out later
Now there is no time to discuss it
The essence that took your body was made by Technology and the one who owns the Technology owns the Universe
What about the fighting all across this base
The Fraction is fighting to keep you alive Ward you have to stay alive and go to Cydonia
The Controllers are after you
Believe me you do not want to meet them
How about some protection
Do you have a weapon
Here is some extra ammunition
You mentioned a vessel
It's a spacecraft leaving for Mars
You must board it undetected by the enemy
We have failed to capture it
Very comforting
How can I get there
There are containers in the hangar ready for uplifting
Get to them somehow try to use your necklace to create a distraction
If you have a memorizer you'll have to use it
One more thing Ward trust no one except the two of us
Anybody else will act according to the Reptoids' orders shoot first then capture the remains
What about the biocontainer
The biocontainer is a biological container
You'll need it you preserve the crystal cone with the Makers' symbols
The Reptoids mustn't get it
The only way to smuggle the cone past the Reptoids is to use the biocontainer and smuggle it inside your body
For that you'll need a sample of your blood in order to match the biocontainer's molecular structure with yours
Blood samples of abductees should be in the medlab and the microscope and the transferring ray apparatus in the biolab next to it
Remember this the biocontainer integration is possible only when using the correct activation code
Anything else
You will need the memorizer in order to establish a link with various base facilities
Now hurry up they are coming for us
Go
The aliens have given you a badge like object they called a Communicator it is called a Secret Sign in inventory
They have also provided you with ammunition for the laser gun that you picked up early in the game
You must now return back to the compartments where you were at the other end of the stone walled corridor
Getting back through the corridor without being shot by a laser is one of the more difficult episodes of this game
The time given to do this is so short it borders on being unfair but it can be done with practice
Before entering the corridor when Walker is ready to say quot Anything else quot to the Fraction aliens in inventory set up the final colored ring sequence that you learned from that particular puzzle then save your game and be fast with the mouse keys when you get to the code lock
And don rsquo t forget to close the doorimmediatelywhen you get through it or you can still be shot
With the implant from the aliens you can now read the alien script
In the oval display are several items telling about attempts and failures to reach an artifact presumably the Maker's Ark
Move on to the next room and access the moonbase map and click on the blinking legend at the top
This brings up the rest of the legends all of which are now readable
Most of these will display messages similar to the ones you just read on the oval display many of these are cryptic others will have reference to things you have learned or experienced
You will also note additional icons indicating more drones
Your position is still the blinking green in front of this second panel
When you click on the Life Support legend on the top left the map will show a red overlay of ventilation ducts which may also be used to move around the moonbase and in fact there are drones patrolling it
Two of these are the menacing orange diamonds and in addition there are two square ones in which are tiny green anchors
These latter ones are harmless maintenance robots and the motionless one on the right is broken
There are four red ovals on the ductwork that are gates through which there is no passage but if you put any of the four rings in the console slot you get control of these gates
Click on one of them and it turns blue signifying that it is open for passage
Fig
is a moonbase map screenshot now showing the ducts and again the colors had to be reversed to get a print
This screenshot will be quite helpful in following the movements you will be making
You are trapped in your present location by drones outside the door zeroing in on the tracking signal from the collar that you can't remove
Check the map
You are going to have to get the collar off and send it away with the drones following it as suggested by the Fraction aliens and to do this you are going to have to move around through the ducts
You need to get to both the maintenance robots and of course avoid the orange drones
Click on the moving maintenance robot patrolling the ductwork on the left and its patrol commands will be shown if it is not visible wait a bit and it will appear from the left
There are four of these sector sector sector and checkpoint exh

The first and last of these are highlighted meaning that they are active
Put the cursor on each of the four patrol commands and the zones will be indicated on the map with blinking arrows showing for sector and a circle for the location of checkpoint exh

It is currently patrolling sector but you want to meet it at the checkpoint so click on the fourth bar and the robot will go to this location and wait
Being broken the other maintenance robot cannot move so you must go to it
By setting the oval red gates alternately open and closed and watching the two patrol drones as they move you can get both of them in the section of ductwork above the upper gate and then confine them there thus giving yourself a safe path to the immobile maintenance robot
When you have done this the upper gate will be red and the other three blue
Now you must get into the ducts
Near the floor on Walker's left you will find a grate in the wall
In inventory click the gun load from the aliens on the laser gun that you picked up early in the game and then click the gun on the grate
A video shows the grate being removed after which you are in the duct with the lasered opening on your right
Move forward until you come to the cross duct then go right to the maintenance robot
One of the reasons that this robot is not working is because the tool that is its right hand is almost torn off
You can use this item so click the blade on it then put the tool in inventory
This robot contains setup readings that you must get into the memorizer the unit used to communicate with several robotic items that you will encounter
You need these settings to activate them on the other maintenance robot waiting at checkpoint exh

Bring the memorizer up from inventory
There is a display panel in the upper half and a command section in the lower half and you can now read all of the printing on it thanks to your alien implant
When you use a command from the lower section watch the announcements in the top and bottom lines of the display
Move the cursor to either side of the duct to turn it into a rotating arrow signaling an about face when you click
Return back through the ducts and out to the map console
Use a ring to get the map and ductwork overlay again
Release the drones from the upper ductwork section and manipulate the ovals to allow them into the section on the right of the right oval which is then made red to confine them there and make the other three blue
You have just been in this duct where the drones are now trapped and you do not need to go there again
Return into the ventilator duct and go straight up to where the drones were previously trapped
At the end of the duct you will find a grate that can be removed by using the robotic hand on two screws at the top corners of the grate
Click on a grate handle to remove it
Drop down into the passageway a location you should recognize
You need to get a data setting from the security sphere floating in the morgue compartment where you began the game so go there and bring up the memorizer
You neutralized the sphere at the beginning of the game and this setting will be needed later
Go back into the passageway and use the medcard as before to go into the medlab
Move to the far end of the room where you got the blood samples
Bring up the display which you can now read
In the closeup click on the quot obductees menu quot then on quot security beacon necklace removal quot
It tells you to approach utilliturret A which is the robot with the red square showing
When you do that two arms reach up and remove the collar put it back in inventory
Note as does Walker in the closeup the statement that the collar beacon is still functional
There is interesting information to be had from other items in the display though it is not necessary for game progress
Leave the medlab and reenter the ductwork
Move to the crossduct and turn right then go to the end of the duct and turn left where you will be facing the waiting maintenance robot that you sent to the checkpoint
Hang the collar on the robot's upraised arm
Now you must activate its inactive sectors so that you can send it to one of them using the data you got from the inactive robot and for this you need to again use the memorizer
Back off from the robot turn left return to the console and use a ring on it for the last time
The orange enemy drones that were outside the door are now next to the active maintenance robot at checkpoint exh
since it is carrying the collar
Click on this robot to show its assignment list all four of which will now be highlighted
You can send the robot to either Sector or the latter is farther away so choose that one and send it there with the orange drones following it since it has the collar
You can watch this happening on the map
Since the drones are no longer outside the console room door you can leave and go back to the biolab and complete the instructions from the Fraction aliens to get the crystal cone past the Reptoids
Click on the panel at the left of the door to open it then cross the passageway and use the medcard to enter the biolab
If you have taken the biocontainer pulsating matter from the pedestal below the long probe put it back now
Go to the microscope click on it to get the closeup and return the glowing lens to it where it becomes a light object
Click on the longer of the five bars beneath the lens and the microscope globe reappears with the red circle on its surface
Blood samples can be placed in the microscope and analyzed by clicking on the touch screen strip
The aliens have told you that the only way to get the crystal cone past the Reptoids is put it inside your body using the biocontainer and that a sample of your blood is necessary
You have four blood samples in inventory and if you analyze them in the microscope you will find that two Nos
and are from Greys and two Nos
and are from humans neither specifically yours
The microscope shows no apparent difference between these latter two but in the subsequent absorption process sample No
will not work and sample No
will so perhaps it is somehow close enough to your own to be suitable
It could be that this sample was taken from you while you were unconscious
Put blood sample No
in the microscope and click on the touch strip
It should show that the sample is human DNA biomatter
Click on the rightmost of the six buttons and below the probe the aliens transferring ray apparatus the DNA can be seen being infused into the biocontainer on the pedestal
Put the biocontainer in inventory and while there click the crystal cone on it
The cone may be faintly seen in the biocontainer
On the memorizer If this absorption process fails go back in your stored games as close as you can to entering the biolab and repeat closely following each of the directions
Use the medcard to return to the passageway
Go down to the far end which will take you to the landing bay
Before you do that however bring up the memorizer and use the arrows to highlightSEC LEVEL
Then as soon as you enter this hangar clicktransmitin order to neutralize the floating security sphere or you will be zapped out of the game
With the security sphere successfully neutralized you can pick up an oxygen mask on your right and an oxygen tank on your left
Place them in inventory as you get them
Bring up the memorizer Enter the container the large box on the right with the red handle
When you are in it get the memorizer and use the arrows to select the container code then click on transmit
The container closes
In inventory click the oxygen tank on the oxygen mask and a long video ensues in which the container is loaded on a spaceship and transported to Mars
Mars Colony Here the character of the game undergoes a decided change
This section is far from linear so presenting here an orderly game procession sequence is not possible
It would seem Walker is aptly named for now you have to keep him moving around in this colony endlessly talking and talking to the various people and amassing information
People keep randomly popping up and leaving and you pretty much have to address everyone that you can using all the queries that are available
On the conversation lists you can choose to be confrontational or agreeable but usually you ask everything that you can
You will find some who won't talk to you at first then after a while those that do will not have much to say because you have exhausted that person's information however depending upon replies from one a flag may be set so that new information will be forthcoming from another and therefore you must keep asking
Here is a list of the personnel you will meet and query in no particular order Recall that the aliens on the moon gave you a badge like Communicator to help you identify a contact they called the Nexus so you must be on the lookout for him by showing this item to colony inhabitants though if you do most will say it is not a good idea to do so
See if you can get a handle on the distinction between the Greys the Reptoids the Controllers and the Men in Black MiB and what is their relationship with each other
All through much of the following you will find things that must be done but not necessarily in the order listed
When you arrive at this colony you will be in an arrival area that is a ledge in a large cave overlooking a fissure
This scene is a long shot and if there are other people there they may be hard to see
The housing for the people here at the colony may be reached following the second directional arrow at the left
Refer to the attached diagram of the Mars Base Fig
to help move around
Check your inventory to see what you still have left from the things you gathered on the moon
You are met by the villain Jack Ripper who will take you to Jack Marshall the man who runs this place for the Greys
He will tell you the rules and give you a chamber card for your housing
Ripper takes you there on the way telling you about the church
He leaves you outside your door
Go into your spartan chamber where there is not much more than a locked cabinet a chair and a bed
Click on the bed to lie down for a bit and you will have a vision or dream in which you are told to look for the Quickener
Leave your room and begin your endless questioning by going to the toilet and talking to Sebastian Mezenga the attendant
There will be a long conversation with him as well as with Dr Morgan and Jessica when you meet them
Some of the people will suggest that you talk to someone else so do that
Much of the dialogue will take place in the casino and the church since for some reason these are safe places from the non human oppressors
In the left rear of the casino is the door to the room of the smartass fortune teller at first her conversation is rather sophomoric something to endure
Sooner or later you are going to have to play a tiresome game of blackjack with the Gambler in the casino and you might as well get it over with
You need to get two items that he has which are his sleeping chamber card and a half of the Pager's card
If you need the rules for this dull game click on the card in the upper right
It may be that he won't bet the card half until it is the last thing he has to wager so by the end of this card playing you should have all of the items that you will be needing plus some new ones that have unaccountably appeared and others that you have won
Obviously the gambling has to be fixed so that you eventually win the items that are needed for the game to progress so while you will lose some things as you play you will win in the end after a tedious playing session
You have to offer two items from which he can choose unless you have only one betable item left some of your items are not candidates for gambling
The Save function is disabled during the blackjack session
Once you get the Pager's half card you can show it around specifically to Hacker and you eventually will learn how to get the second half
This card is vital
It bears repeating that you must keep moving and talking to anyone you can particularly Jessica Dr Jeffrey Morgan and Preacher John Holbrook as well as most others except the Gambler in order to learn more and to trigger new conversation or action
A couple of things for which you should be on the lookout In the personnel quarters there are several cabinets with slider puzzle locks you have already seen one in your room
There are clues that turn up to solve these puzzles and you can't solve one unless the clue is present or in inventory
See Fig

After solving one you must click on the word quot done quot at the bottom of the puzzle the puzzle disappears and you can click on the cabinet for it to open
Note Probably the first of these cabinets that you encounter will be the one in Rita's room off the casino when you finally find the door unlocked and she is absent
Pick up the three Tarot cards from the table from an earlier visit with Rita the cabinet puzzle clue is the Wheel of Fortune card
Examine the card and you will see the same items that are in the cabinet lock slider squares
Note that the squares may be rotated to orient them exactly as seen on the card except for one of the boots by using the right mouse key
The upper center square with two triangles is symmetrical and may have to be rotated twice
When you get the cabinet open you will find a slot concealed behind a book on the lower shelf use the King of Pentacles Tarot card on this slot and a door will open behind Rita's table
Hurry to this door before it closes and you can enter a secret room
From the back of the room you can pick up a notebook or you can get it later
Don rsquo t bother with the door on the right at this time unless you have managed to get Pager's complete card
Close Rita rsquo s cabinet door on your way out and you may wish to put the Tarot cards back on the table
After you have rescued Rosa from Ripper the next time you locate her she will give you a diagram that she tells you is the key to the cabinet in Slash's room and in which is the other half of Pager's card that you won from the Gambler
There seems to be an anomaly here from the Gambler you have won mdash or will do so mdash his room admittance card and so identified in inventory which will open the room next to yours however when you get the clue from Rosa she says that it is Slash's room
Accepting this to be the case apply the Gambler rsquo s card to enter the room to the right of yours and using Rosa's clue to solve the slider puzzle get the other half of the card from the cabinet
Find Hacker give both card halves to him then the next time you find him he will return it repaired
Keep talking to people and learning things
Eventually you will find Jake the Radioman who shows you a note he found on his radio
It is from Holbrook asking you to meet him in his room
When you get there the door is ajar
Save your game
Inside the room the door closes and locks the call bell beside it does not work and air is being drawn from the room
You have begun a timed puzzle in which you must repair the bell or you will suffocate
The game Save function is disabled during this timed sequence
Click on the picture above the door then a little way up on the right side of it find a hidden switch that allows the picture to swing back and show the bell circuitry
Using the screwdriver you can remove a plate at the top where you can see a pair of open wires
Click on the wires which will join crossed then press the bell button causing sparks
Look at the cabinet again to find the wires are once more open
Join them again making sure they are not crossed click on them twice
The bell still does not work
Click on the round knob to remove the fuse that has burned out
Put the fuse in inventory
This fuse looks remarkably like the C S M
model
Put the C S M
model in the fuse base sitting in bottom of the cabinet
Click on the base to screw the assembly back in place then try the bell button again
Assuming that you have performed the foregoing within the allotted time and successfully repaired the call bell the scene shifts to Hacker and Preacher John talking in the church when they suddenly hear bells
Another scene shift back to the Preacher's room where you have been resuscitated
The Preacher denies the Radioman's note and the scheme is attributed to Marshall aided by Ripper
Should you check your inventory you will find that the Secret Sign the medallion from the aliens on the moon is missing someone has taken it
Everyone leaves
Follow them out and look for Jessica probably in the church to have a very long conversation with her concerning implants the MiB and Dr Webber
After Rita's remarks about Dr Webber you can now talk to and get answers from him but you won't learn much
Disagreeable fellow
If you can locate Hacker he will give you the repaired Pager's card
However you can't look for him in the casino as Jake tells you that Ripper is in there mad and looking for trouble after the failure to suffocate you
Look elsewhere for Hacker when you find him and get the repaired card ask him about the Nexus and the Inner Circle
Pager's card will open the preacher's door so go there and look for him
He won't be there use the bell button to see if that will bring him
It won't but you will meet him as you leave
The bell has called the people to church ask the Preacher to cover for you as you have something to do
He reluctantly agrees
Go to the casino where Ripper has since left then to the fortune teller's room using Pager's card to get in
Click on the cabinet door to bring up the solved slider click on quot done quot then click on the cabinet which will open to show the slot behind the book on the lower shelf
Pager's card applied to the slot will open the secret door behind the table
Hurry through it
Now go through the door at the right of the room
You will see a book that will fall to the floor when you click on it revealing another slot on which to try the Pager's card
A section of the wall to your left starts to shimmer and you can pass through to another room
Here you will find a notebook containing a star chart and a diary
After you examine it Jessica walks in and there is a discussion about the Makers their technology and the center of it in the Holy Mountain on Draco
Jessica tells Walker that Preacher John is the Nexus then they join him in the outer room
More discussion mainly about the situation they are in about the crystal cone and the diary and escaping through ventilation ducts
Jessica says she is going with you and there is a video of passage through the ducts to an ending
Use the Pager's card on the sensor to open a hatch and go out to a base core panoramic scene
There is a small red triangle at left center signifying your position click on that and you will go to a large corridor with spacecraft traveling overhead
A red movement indicator points to the wall on the right when you follow it you will find a sensor on a pillar
Once again use the Pager's card on the sensor and you can pass through the wall to the right of the sensor
A video places you on a walkway over an abyss
Cross the walkway and through a door where you will be met by a Fraction alien
After some discussion about releasing your biocontainer and stating that you are in a safe place he leads you to the Fraction High Council
More talk about the technovirus and the old technology
The Reptoids want it to destroy just about everything including the earth
You are told that when you landed at the Mars human colony a Fraction agent managed to switch your memorizer with another so Marshall does not have the one to access the biocontainer within you
The needed memorizer is hidden back at the colony so you have to go there and get it
Rita Mayden is somehow involved
Just as there is mention of a needed keycard the Reptoids attack
So much for safety During a long video a Council member Gowddeln helps you escape in a speeder and you and Jessica are returned to the landing area on the Mars human colony
The game takes you to Preacher John's room
He says that the Controllers surprised the colony with a gas attack but Rita saved them by creating a shield
It is not exactly clear but this conversation indicates a bridge must be lowered in order to get to your hidden memorizer
Holbrook suggests that you mingle with the others so suspicions will not be aroused concerning your absence and you are back to chasing around and asking questions
Specifically talk to Jake and Hacker see if you can make any sense of what they say also find Dr Morgan who says someone unknown has a dangerous implant and Jake Shaffer tells you that Marshall has a bridge controller in his safe
Go to Rita's room using the Pager's card to get in where you will find the door to the secret room open
Go all the way back to the diary with the star chart and there you will find Rita
She tells you that there is a rumor that a bridge controller is hidden somewhere in the Colony which you already know if you have talked to Jake
Open the diary to the star chart then click the notebook that you have been carrying on it and the star chart will be copied to the notebook
Leave and when you get outside the casino Ripper will be there with information that something has happened to the Preacher and Jessica
Ripper leaves telling you to go to the Brazilian's room
This is the room two doors to the right of your room
The scene then shifts to that room where Ripper is standing menacingly in front of Marshall and Jessica sitting tensely in the room's chair
There is some dialog threatening from Ripper pseudo urbane from Marshall
He has placed a poison dart necklace on Jessica and has a remote control that can kill her in seconds
He wants the biocontainer and gives you minutes to turn it over and has Ripper set a timer
You are now at the beginning of another timed sequence but in this one the game Save function remains working
Mike Shaffer comes in and tells Marshall the guards want him something to do with the Preacher
They leave
More threatening interchange between Walker and Ripper then a video fight in which Ripper is killed and Walker is apparently unharmed
Superb astronaut training
Get from Ripper's body his pager and freezer
You must find Hacker to save Jessica
He is in the casino and he tells you Marshall has a backup controller in his safe
He also tells you that he saw Marshall go into his office then he automatically takes Pager's card and goes to Jessica to try and slow things down
You will have to get Marshall out of his office
Leave the casino and as soon as you are out of the door use Ripper's pager
Click on the long blue button which turns briefly red
Put the pager back in inventory and get the freezer
Walker will move to a point where he can freeze Marshall who comes to answer the pager call
As soon as he appears by the double doors from the corridor click the freezer on him and he crumples
From him get his freezer it disappears two are not needed and from his pockets get his personal card and a diagram
Go to Marshall's office and tell Slash you need to get the decoder to save Jessica and he lets you go in
The large cube on the floor below some pictures is Marshall's safe click on it and a slider combination appears
The diagram you just got from Marshall is the slider clue
However you solve the puzzle click on quot done quot the safe opens and from it you get the data reader backup controller
The picture above the safe is a hologram click the freezer on it and it dissolves so that you can get the implant gun from the shelf behind it
Hurry to Sebastian's room and open the door using Marshall's personal card
Give the data reader to Hacker who determines the code to free Jessica and all three of you leave the room
After a short conversation you decide the only way to hide Ripper's body is throw it into the abyss
This done Hacker and Jessica leave and you are on your own in the landing area just outside the entrance to the rooms
On the far right across the abyss the cursor can locate a control room often referred to in the game as the controller's room
There seems to be no indication of it but you are once more in a timed interval of unspecified length before the Controllers discover you and end the game
In inventory click Marshall's personal card on the data reader which then appears much as the memorizer did
Use the red arrows to highlightbridge on then presstransmit
An energy or force bridge appears crossing the abyss to the control room
Watch Walker closely and get him across the bridge just up to the control room then use the data reader again highlightbridge offand presstransmitto make the bridge disappear
Enter the control room
Inside the control room is a window through which you can see the landing area where a Control speeder is arriving for a medical emergency
If you have removed the bridge in time they will not know that you are in the control room and the speeder will leave
There are two cabinets just to the left of the window with a pair of sensors between them
Click the pager's card on the right sensor and from the right cabinet you can get your memorizer and also two implants
Get the memorizer from inventory and use the red arrows to highlight the last scrambled code unscramblethis code the same number of times you scrambled it presstransmit and a video shows the biocontainer coming out of Walker's hand
It may be found in inventory with the crystal cone inside it
Leave the control room and use the data reader to reform the force bridge
Since you are close by and have the code for the cabinet slider lock that is in your room the code is the center part of the star chart copy you may as well go there
When you go through the solving routine and open the cabinet you find some purple tiles
Walker thinks Rita should know something about them so go to her where she is still in the secret room puzzling over the diary
On the way you may run into someone probably Slash with bad news about Preacher John
If you do after telling it he will go through a newly accessible door into the guards' quarters
You can follow him to see the Preacher but he is unconscious so you can't react with him
Go to Rita
Rita has nothing to offer concerning the tiles
She does however have an idea of how you and Jessica were found in the secret Fraction headquarters
She thinks it was because of a trace implant Jessica has been on walks before and has not been caught so it must be in you
She says you should see Dr Webber because of the implant experience that Jessica told you about
After you leave Rita the crystal cone is no longer in the biocontainer
When you find Webber tell him you need help and you gather in Rita's room with Jessica and Hacker
Webber at first refuses but is persuaded
He has everyone but Hacker leave and after a video of visions and impressions the implant is out and a minute countdown timer is running
Hacker says to inject the removed implant in someone while it is still functional there is only a limited time
That must be what the timer indicates at any rate if it expires the Controllers find you
If you have not yet encountered Slash he should be in the room with the red holofountain and he will tell you about the Preacher and you can follow him into the guards' room if he has already told you go directly to the guards' room and through it to Preacher John
Click the just removed implant on the implant gun then click the gun on Holbrook
Why
Slash will tell you that Preacher John said quot Picture
Double T Five quot before passing out
Return to Rita in the room with the diary to check on her progress
Keep talking to people you meet on the way
Rita says she drew contour lines of a shape needed to activate the crystal cone which she returns to you and then leaves
Click on the diary to see this contour then click the purple tiles from your room on it
The tiles will separate into seven pieces on the opposite page
Left click on a tile to engage it right click to rotate it a quarter turn as many times as you think might be required then drag it to the outline that Rita drew
There is no automatic solution as there is for the sliders but it is not very hard
When you get it completed examine it closely to find a hard to see circle just SE of center
Place the crystal cone in this circle the books pages flip rapidly and a shimmering dot of light rises from it
Click on the dot to see a multi pastel colored crystal that the game calls an object
Ward says it is pure light
Place it in inventory
Preacher John is still a concern
Go to his room as you have seen there a closet that has not yet been opened
The picture above the door is doubtless the one to which Holbrook referred in the words you got from Slash
It may still open showing the bell circuitry but if it is you can close it by finding an arrow at the very top left corner
Near the center of the picture the cursor says there is an ornament click on it for a closeup and you will see the word Rev doubly underlined
This is the clue for the closet slider lock
You would be well advised to use the Easy Game solution for this slider because the squares in the unsolved one in no way resemble those of the solved one
The open closet reveals some miscellaneous books click very carefully up and down along the backs of these books and you will turn up the Preacher's personal card
You will also find inside the Bible a data reader another item of which you do not need two so it stays there
However since these items accept personal cards try inserting the Preacher's card in the data reader that you have
A lot of codes appear bring up those below the last line and sure enough one begins with tt
Back to the Preacher in the guards' quarters
Highlight the tt code and presstransmit
Something glows in Holbrook's hand
Click on it and a cross shaped object called a psi comm appears as well as a picture with the name Gowddeln in it
Click the psi comm on the exclamation point in the picture and you have a conversation with Gowddeln about a window of opportunity to go to the Holy Mountain on Draco
You are to meet him at the entrance to the city at the end of the ducts
There you have a long conversation about the details of the trip as follows We meet again Walker
Gowddeln
It's good to see you
Can you help me
Yes
We have organized everything necessary for your trip to Draco
How far away is it
light years away
I'm starting to have second thoughts about this
It is the only true way to go
I am sure you think the same
Yeah
You will board Dorb Adiopter
It is a Reptoid supply ship
You will have to pass a series of security scans to do that
You will identify yourself as a member of the MTI the Makers Technology Institute
Take this card and this implant which will activate upon firing
They are all programmed with your ID code
If the implant recognizes that it has been extracted from your body it will start to scream for guards
It takes a minute minute and a half at best for the implant to recognize that situation
A useable feature
Do you have an implant gun
Yes
Plenty of ammo too
Good
What do I need that for
You can not enter the ship alone
You have to find a crew member and put him under your control
Use him to increase your chance of survival once you are aboard
Also keep in mind that you don rsquo t stand a chance directly fighting the Reptoids
You can only try to fight them from somewhere else or from a moment earlier or ahead in time
I've been hoping we could do this quietly
This is our minimum violence plan
A council made of three remaining Fraction members has spent several days working out all the details
Trust us
The Dorb like every Reptoid interstellar ship is made according to the Makers blueprints
This makes it a potential ally of yours
If you are recognized by the computer as the Ward the Reptoid crew could become strangers on their own ship
That is I am afraid the only development that is likely to succeed
All right
No human is allowed to prowl the docks unsupervised
This holomask will complete your disguise but I doubt that it will fool any scanners more complex than those used on the docks
Go now and Godspeed
He departs having given you an ID implant card a special implant and a holomask to disguise yourself as a Reptoid
Click on the holomask and the holomask control appears
There are four settings shown on the left that you highlight using the wings of the arrowhead on the right then activate by pressing the arrowhead point
SelectReptoid maintenanceand press the point whereupon you will finally see what a Reptoid looks like
Go out the hatch into the city
Just to the right of the large vertical central tube the cursor will show a right pointing red movement arrow that will take you to a view of the docks
Enter the smaller hexagonal opening in the center that takes you to a loading dock
Here there are Reptoids on a break enjoying a joke
When they are finished talking a Grey is left standing at the end of the dock
Load one of the two standard implants in the implant gun and click the gun on the Grey to place the implant in him to bring him under your control
Talk to him
He is called Bloom
There is a Q amp A session about boarding what you can carry what you will encounter etc
Put the special implant in the implant gun and fire it into the biocontainer in inventory
Get out the memorizer which should still show the highlighted implant code from when you removed the biocontainer in the control room
Click ontransmitand the absorption video will show the biocontainer being taken into Walker's hand
Scrambling is not necessary this time
Take off the holomask talk to the Grey and a video takes you aboard the space ship Dorb Adiopter
Space Ship Now the game action gets more complicated because you must switch back and forth playing as either Walker or Bloom and you can exchange inventory items
There is nothing in your inventory but the absorbed biocontainer containing the special implant
Bloom has a memorizer and an STD card
Click on Bloom and tell him that you want him to do something for you
When he agrees the inventory icon at lower right rotates to a different one Bloom's and a new star icon appears above it briefly at first but more permanently later
You are now playing as Bloom and you have his inventory
You are on space ship Level D On the wall are a console a locked door and an open container
As Bloom get out the memorizer and highlightcomm link to container then click ontransmitto establish the comm link
The container's code will appear note what it is then click onreceiveto bring the code information into the memorizer
Still as Bloom go to the console and click on it then successively click on the three Level indicators
At each of the three there will be a diagram of these ship levels and you are to run the cursor over all of the sections of each diagram to highlight them and see what they are
Click on Walker to get a list of questions about the functions each of the sections
Fig
shows labeled screenshots of these three Levels colors reversed
The last question on the list is about the unidentified room in Level E After answering that tell Bloom again that you want him to do something for you
Bloom is to click on the locked door then in closeup use the STD card on the center slot and the door will open
Send him through into the corridor
A short way in on Bloom's left your right will be the door to the Storage section which the STD card will also open
In the shelves along the side you can get closeups of Maintenance Equipment Hardware Tools and Electronic Devices in each of these is a small chest from which you can remove a maintenance key a wire cutter and two communicators respectively
There is also a closeup of Electronic Parts but you can't get anything from it at this time
Have Bloom exit the Storage area and continue along the corridor
A Reptoid will appear from Life Support
After a very brief conversation click on the red elevator call button almost obscured by the Reptoid's head and an elevator door button will appear
Press the yellow area and enter the elevator when the WAIT notice goes out
Press the control for Level C and the tiny Level map on the control will change to that map when it gets there
Leave the elevator
Bloom is in the Hibernation area on Level C Along the wall are cryobooths and Bloom must find his which is nearby on the left
When he locates it near the leftmost set of lights he will say so and that there is a panel on the left
Find this panel with the cursor the resulting closeup requires the use of the maintenance key on the container lock to open it and show a full gas tank
Take the tank then click on the red and blue wires to disconnect them
Call the elevator go down to Level D and return to the Storage area where from the Electronic Parts closeup you now can a get a Y microjack
Go back up to the hibernation area on Level C Move forward to the large rectangular container with slots in the top and get the empty gas tank
Open the cryobooth panel again and put the Y microjack in the microslot on the left then connect both the red and blue wires to the Y microjack
Put in the empty gas tank and close the panel
Take the elevator down and return to Walker waiting in the Cargo Bay on Level D Click on Walker to talk to him
The star icon will appear above Bloom's inventory icon at lower right
In Bloom rsquo s inventory click on the following items to transfer them to Walker's inventory Click on the star icon to switch to Walker's inventory and check to see that he has all four items
Announce that quot there is nothing left to be done quot and quot await the call to hibernation quot A video supplies the latter at the conclusion of which Bloom says the waiting is over Walker tells him he had better get going and the star icon appears again
Click on the star to switch to Walker and use the STD card to open the door
Click on the double triangle icon to switch to Bloom and send him through the open door and down the corridor toward the elevator
He will be met by a Reptoid and taken to the hibernation area
Place him at his cryobooth and click on the small cyan mark to bring up the booth control screen
Choose quot open booth quot and quot sphereblend quot then click on Bloom to have him lie in the booth
Do not hesitate in this sequence or the Reptoids will discover Bloom's implant
A Reptoid says there will be a scan in a few minutes
Use the star icon to switch to Walker in Level C and save your game
Click on the container for a closeup then click on the crates for a closeup inside that
Put the full gas tank on the floor behind the crates
Call up the memorizer and highlight the code for the biocontainer implanted in your hand
Note Click ontransmitto remove the biocontainer which goes to inventory
A second counter is initiated because as Gowddeln said the implant recognizes that it has been withdrawn
Put the biocontainer on the floor by the bottom of the gas tank and open the valve on the gas tank
Get the memorizer again and highlight the container code then click ontransmitto close the container
Click on the door and use the STD card to open it then go to the elevator and call it
An intruder alarm may sound but ignore it and hurry into the elevator as soon as you can
Go to Level E and when you exit look for a door on the right
Go through the door and stand on the circular platform for a scan where you are recognized as the Ward and allowed to enter the Security room
Here you are safe for a while
A video shows that a Reptoid has homed in on the implant in the biocontainer that you put in the container on Level D and when he opens it he is laid out by the escaping gas
Save your game
Click on the Security console
Deny the early awakening request
Deny and keep denying the request for elevator service from Level E it is from a Reptoid trying to get to you
Step back from the console switch to Bloom and click on the EXIT button
When Bloom is out of his cryobooth click on the red elevator call button then on the yellow elevator door button
If it continues to show WAIT that means that Walker has to deal with an elevator request from the Reptoid
Switch to Walker click on the console and deny the request from Level E Step back switch to Bloom and have him try again to call the elevator
Keep repeating this alternation and before long if you are quick enough Walker will see an elevator service request from Level C Approve this request and have Bloom go to Level D where he will find the gassed Reptoid quot separated from the flow quot lying in front of the open container
It is not explicitly stated and there is no counter visible but you have a limited time to pursue the following series of actions before the Reptoid outside Security sends some sort of lethal drone flying through the scanner and brings the game to an end so you had better move as expeditiously as you can saving your game often
Click on the Reptoid by the container and Bloom will get his gold SEC card
Use the card to open the door and go all the way down the corridor to locate the door on the left just before the elevator
This is the door to Life Support and may be opened using the SEC card
Move Bloom into Life Support and locate the console Have Bloom click on quot abort quot Switch to Walker and have him approve the abort request Switch to Bloom and click on quot set grav gen shutdown quot click on quot affirmed quot select quot minutes quot select quot until we arrive at Draco system quot click on quot affirmed quot Switch to Walker for approval
Switch to Bloom and use maintenance key on round lock at panel bottom left use wire cutters to cut both wires from LSR Have Bloom back off from Life Support console leave the room and call the elevator from Level D Switch to Walker and as before approve his request while continuing denial of elevator request from Level E Switch to Bloom in the elevator and select Level C Go to his cryobooth and click on the small cyan mark that brings up the booth control panel
Select quot open booth quot then when that is observed to happen select quot hibernation quot
Click on Bloom to put him into the cryobooth then answer quot yes quot to both computer questions that appear on lower left screen
Switch to Walker and approve Bloom's hibernation request
Leave the control screen and click on the Vitrifax on the left side of the Security room
Initiate the Vitrifax and affirm the procedure
Choose minutes in response to questioning from Vitrifax control and enter the Vitrifax
Protected by the Vitrifax the attempt by the Reptoid to kill you backfires and he is destroyed
Return to the control panel and disengage the security lock then leave through the scanner and call the elevator
Go to Level D walk the length of the corridor toward but not into the Cargo Bay and enter the door on the left
Proceed through the scanner and you will be greeted by the ship's computer
After talking with the computer there will be a video taking you to the Holy Mountain on Draco
When you again gain control follow the red forward movement cursor across bridges and up an elevator to a portal in the center of a pathway
Click on the portal and an animated disk called a FLOW appears click on this and a video takes you to the final puzzle
This consists of a series of crystals six
that must be changed from colorless to different colors
Doubtless there is a pattern to do this but if you keep clicking on a central animation called a TELEPORT as it appears then on a colorless crystal unless there are only colored ones you will eventually solve this puzzle signified by a very long enigmatic concluding video and the credits roll
Commentary Following are some things that came to my attention as I played The Ward
Nothing overwhelming but things to which I would rather not have had to adjust
They are my personal observations and others may well disagree and I readily admit that I could have missed something that would nullify my objections
It has happened before
Fairly early on Walker is given a medallion called a secret sign in inventory by the Fraction to help him identify a secret ally in the Mars Colony called the Nexus whenever he tries this he is told not to show it and when he does show it to the person who turns out to be the Nexus he will not admit to recognition
Several personnel call it a Communicator as did the Fraction aliens when they present it to him and that it contains an important message
It is eventually stolen mdash and we are not told by whom mdash and we never find out what the message is
However it is not needed to identify the Nexus because Jessica tells Walker that it is Holbrook
Seems to me this goes beyond a red herring
Behind Rita rsquo s room in the Mars Colony is a secret room containing a short diary in which there appears a box that says quot You quickly page through the diary and discover something of interest near the end quot I must have missed something because no matter how quickly I paged all I found was another box that said all the rest of the pages are blank And what are those squiggles on page
We got to know the people in the Mars Human colony mdash not all admirable but I for one would like to know what became of them
And what about the Quickener that Walker was to find
When first arriving on the space ship to take the elevator between levels you only had to call it and indicate the level later when Walker is in Security approval has to be given to use it
This ploy may make the game more challenging but it is inconsistent
Security isonLevel E as is the Reptoid attempting to attack Walker just on the other side of the Scanner from where he launches a lethal drone if not thwarted so why does he have to keep calling for the elevator and how can he be kept at bay by denying the Level E elevator request
There is much effort in getting the crystal cone and putting it into Walker rsquo s body getting it back out then converting it to what appears to be a crystal that Walker says is pure light and that it is a Maker rsquo s artifact inventory calls it an object
It is in Walker rsquo s inventory until he boards the space ship after which it is no longer there
Bloom says it may be registered as cargo
The ship rsquo s computer remarks about the quot presence of the Ark within your system quot There is mystery here
This game displays much originality but there are places where it seems to me that the conversation does not flow all that smoothly and I think the same can be said for the action
Item nomenclature is odd at times
The former might be attributed to the fact that the names showing in the credits indicate that the game originated in eastern Europe and words may have suffered in translation
Finally I contend that it also suffers from what happens in many Adventure games a weak ending that gives the impression of running out of steam and being quickly brought to an unsatisfactory conclusion just for the sake of ending

EPISODE IN THE BEGINNING When you come to you are alone inside a damaged cabin of some kind
There are a couple of control panels on the left wall a couple of dead bodies lying on cots and there's a strange collar or necklace apparatus around your neck As you become more cognizant you realize there is a sphere of some kind floating overhead
Walk front screen to a case sitting on the bulkhead at the end of one of the cots
Take theSCREWDRIVERfrom the case
Move to the red and green lit control panel on your left Click on the center screen You will see what looks like a blueprint or chart of some kind Maybe its the moon base Click on any area within the grid and you will see a red bar appear at the top of the screen Click on the leftmost position which shows a yellow lighted underline It will display the game screen again Clicking on some of the other postiions on the red bar will bring up a message in an alien language You can't understand all this yet
But don't worry about it Click on the far left position on the bar to exit the screen again and click on the left red vertical strip on the side of the control panel You see a small slot there But you have nothing to use with the slot Or do you Right click to bring up your inventory and menu screen No there's nothing there that will fit in the slot
Just that uncomfortable looking necklace you have around your neck Put your inventory screen away by right clicking again
Click on the right green vertical side of the control panel Hmmmm another small slot appears on the side Further to the right you see an alien body lying on a cot Click on it again when you are in the close up screen Click on the dead alien's uniform pocket with the screwdriver and remove a bluishMED CARD Notice the insignia on the alien's uniform It looks like an acorn that has been separated in the middle
While the Med Card is still rotating right click to place it in inventory and exit the close up window by clicking on the X in the lower right corner Right click again if you want to make sure the card displays in your inventory screen along side the necklace
Turn away from the alien's body cross the room and examine in close up the human body on the opposite cot The body is badly mutilated but you can retrieve no item from it
Click on the floating sphere Could it be some kind of antigravity security robot that is supposed to observe or guard you
After clicking on everything else in the cabin attempt to go down the passageway The necklace will begin emitting an increasingly loud and uncomfortable alarm which will inevitably drive you back into the cabin After testing the alarm's volume duration and possible harm to yourself you discover that you can make brief trips into the passageway and back to the cabin with no problem Walk down to the first dead alien body lying to the left in the passageway and take the red and blueSECURITY CARD With both cards in your inventory return to the control panel in the cabin Use the red and blue card you just picked up on the left red panel The panel turns green Use the other bluish card you found first on both panels No luck It must be for another panel somewhere
Leave the cabin again And as you walk down the passageway toward the second dead alien again you note that the necklace alarm does not sound You must have disabled it with the security card Look at the dead alien in close up again and click on theBLUE RINGon his left hand You can't remove it It's stuck You don't have anything to remove it with in your inventory Exit the close up after examining the alien's body It appears he was killed in the explosion you witnessed as you were coming to Was this installation being attacked by some other alien enemy
Pick up the unchargedLASER GUNfrom the passageway You may need it
Across the passageway you see another alien body thrown up on some storage units Click on it You find this alien carried nothing of value to you Walk down the passageway to the hatch at the far end Heat is coming from the hatch Better not enter Stop to examine the third alien body and take the ring with the blue carving on it Go back along the passageway to enter the hatch on the left side wall No dice The door has a nearby sensor Take your bluish Med Card out of inventory and use it on the sensor The door will open onto what appears to be some sort of strange laboratory or medical facility for performing robotic surgery
There's another hatch in the rear middle of this cabin But for now use your Med Card on the red sensor to the right of the hatch where you entered It activates the screen to the right of the sensor Click on the screen for a close up Touch the symbols at bottom left of the close up screen to see that it operates the suspended surgical equipment in the center of the cabin ceiling It looks dangerous Use the close up screen's control panel to lower the equipment from the ceiling
Use the screen again to lower a sharp set of surgical blades from the equipment Walk over and snap off one of the blades just click on them
Go back into the passageway and click on the dead alien with the ring you couldn't remove Use the blade to ugh
remove theCYAN RINGfrom the dead alien's finger
Go to the far right rear corner of the cabin and look at the console there It also displays a red sensor at upper left Use the Med Card on the sensor You see a close up of alien symbols You aren't able to decipher the language or use the panel So exit it Click on the blue lit overhead cabinets above the console to learn that they are filled with jars of some sort of tissue You can't access the cabinets and you probably don't want to
Note that the lower left cabinet is unlit and appears to be standing open Click on it and removeTHREE BLOOD SAMPLES Now turn to the left and in the middle of the wall enter the hatch to the rear cabin Your viewing postion is reversed and you can see Walker standing at the entry
Click on the blue light on the raised platform right in front of you Its a microscope In close up click on the smaller upper and lower buttons on the little control panel to move the bluish rings around on the glass globe When you get them aligned overlaying one another click on the middle horizontal button to turn the overlaying circles to red which releases the sample from the microscope
This isBLOOD SAMPLE
Put it in your inventory
You need to find the blood sample that looks human and code the bio container pulsating matter you see on the platform in the center of the cabin to match your own Put Blood Sample in the microscope and use the buttons on the left side control strip to examine rotate and bombard the human like sample with beams you will see activated at the bio container position Just make sure you have a sample that looks like human blood and you use all the available buttons When you are finished remove the blood sample and take theGLOWING LENSout of the microscope
The room will go dark Don't worry the emergency lights will come on in about seconds
If you want to go around the periphery of the cabin and check out all the screens and consoles
But you will find that none of them are usable to your advantage
Use your Med Card on the left side hatch sensor and enter another passageway Stay right where you are as you witness a laser battle between one of our now familiar little aliens and some unseen enemy lurking down the passageway
When you see a pause in the firing pattern quickly cross the passageway to a massive door Turn back to the passageway and watching the laser fire carefully go back into the passageway and get theGREEN RINGfrom the body of the alien lying nearby
Then go back to the door and click on the blue sensor to determine that you need additional lighting of some kind to get the sensor to operate You have no flashlite or anything like that So it looks like you'll have to try that Glowing Lens from the microscope
Seems logical Use the microscope lens on the sensor panel to the right of the massive doors A close up of the controls appears THE RINGS PUZZLEPull out your trusty Screwdriver and remove the uppermost left panel on the sensor in the close up screen Keep trying It takes several nudges with the Screwdriver to get the panel free You will see three wire circuits The third switch in the lower position is blue Click on it to make sure it is red like the other two All three circuits are now functional
Below the three red circuits are three horizontally placed sensor positions Does it look to you like the insignia on those rings you have been gathering might fit in there Good thinking You must correctly match the color positioning of all three rings three separate times The puzzle is random so there is no established solution Also the puzzle is timed There is some sort of timer device running on the right side of the panel
If you wait too long you will have to start the ring color sequence over again
Try placing the Green Cyan and Blue rings G C B in that order
If you get one green line showing at the bottom of the display you have the first color sequence correctly placed If that combination doesn't work try C B G or another You can't use the same color of ring twice in one sequence When you get two green lines to appear simultaneously on the lower display the little alien who is still feverishly firing his laser will toss you a fourthRED RINGfrom his position
NOTE If you have your inventory screen up you may miss seeing the Red Ring It is laying to the right of your feet Pick it up SAVE YOUR GAME
Now you will have to try to find out which of the rings in the sequence you should replace with the Red Ring If you remember the last combination success with this last challenge shouldn't take more than three tries to figure out where the Red Ring goes in the third sequence But in any case you will get it by trial and error REMEMBER THE VERY LAST COLOR SEQUENCE and write it down as quickly as you can
When the doors open and your cursor is free again click on the sensor at Walker's right to close the doors and prevent your being caught by the security drone and put off line
If you are caught by the drone go back to your last save game at the Ring Puzzle and reenter the correct codes to open the door again
You find yourself in another large cabin with a holographic projection device in the center Go to the far end of the center table
Click on the smaller rectangular button on the right end of the center table
If you are at the back of the table you will see the small button on the left side that is marked bump
But its the same button The memorizer panel will rise from a larger rectangular panel on the top of the table
Play around with it a bit to find you can't do anything logical with it yet TheMEMORIZERremote goes into your inventory
Go to the first display console on the right side of the room from the entry doors The upper central display shows you the same strange chart you accessed in the first cabin
NOTE You've probably figured out by now that its the Moon Base map you are looking at and your position is indicated by the flashing green cross The stationary green cross is the dead human in the first cabin The flashing red symbols are live aliens
The steady blue symbols are dead aliens now including your little alien buddy who threw you the Red Ring The circulating red diamond symbols designate a security drone
The green symbols are security robots As yet you do not know what the red cross in the upper right corner of the chart is
Could it be a live human being
Click on the bar at top screen in the second position from the left to view a lighted red lined overlay of the chart But you don't know what that means yet Exit the chart by clicking on the first bar position to the left Click on the console in front of you and see that it has a ring slot Do you have the correct ring for accessing the console Trying each of them will prove that you do not
Or maybe you have the right ring but something else needs to be accomplished first
Move to the larger console to the left on the wall Look at the big screen to be reminded of home once more Homesick Clicking on the many buttons screens and switches is useless
Click on the glass door to the left of the big console in the rear of the room and enter another cabin
Saving your game along in here might be a good safety precaution
Look around the room checking out various consoles and screens On the back wall you will find a large screen with an interesting looking alien symbol And another smaller screen beside it which displays undecipherable alien language all in red In the front screen section of the cabin you see another hologram projector device This time installed in a cot Behind the cot is another display of consoles and screens
But none of them are accessible After you have looked around use you Security Card red and blue on the door on the left side of the room You will exit to find yourself in what appears to be a long corridor which is lined with stone walls
Walk down the long dangerous looking corridor to another huge hatch at the opposite end Open the hatch and enter a large circular area This room has a ring of reddish lights around the walls And a black sphere floating over a green circular platform on the floor There is a gray disk shaped object suspended in the air over the middle circle This disk is designated as a plate when you pass your cursor over it Click on the plate Walker will walk over and stand within the green circle Click on the glowing plate to the right It glows and now displays symbols of some kind Click on the plate again You will take thePLATEand be able to place it in your inventory Walker ask Now where did I see this before
You recognize it from the symbol on one of the screens in the security control room you have just left at the other end of the corridor
Now notice that another plate has appeared in the same place Click on it This time the plate lights up and a shower of fairy dust twinkling lights appears and the plate transforms itself Then it moves directly away from you If you place your cursor over the new reddish floating object it reads tiles
Click on it
Hold the mouse button down for a few seconds Walker will walk over and take the object Put theTILES along with theCRYSTAL CONEin your inventory with the first Plate If you click now on the circle of reddish lights around the wall you will note that it is now called an energized section
Now click on the engraving symbol at Walker's feet THE FLOATING TILE PUZZLE Take a good look at the engraving in the full screen mode The Tiles and Crystal Cone will fit nicely into this engraving Look in your inventory and click on the Plate This will bring up the sample of the pattern you are attempting to duplicate
You will get hints as you try to duplicate the proper color shape and sequence of placing the required tiles on the engraving Here are the hints in order Those tiles are some sort of color invertors
It seems that tile order is very essential Check areas on the stone Plate where only two colors overlap Check the schematic where only triangles overlap The are only possible combinations Triangles don't come first Triangles come second Start with Cyan Green comes last Yellow we have
Pink and Blue we don't
Cyan or Green
Green or Cyan
HERE'S THE TRICK The answer lies in WHICH CIRCLE and WHICH TRIANGLE is the right color and in the right place at the right time Both circles and both triangles can be interchanged in the circular and triangular spots Also the colors on all four pieces you are going to use can be changed You have to find the RIGHT circles in Cyan and Green and the RIGHT triangles in RED AND YELLOW And you have to place them at the right time
Remember you can skip this puzzle if you are in EASY mode just by clicking on the gray bar above the puzzle But wouldn't you rather solve it yourself Here's the solution and the correct sequence of placing the tiles But remember it has to be the right circle triangle and right color in the right place
The rightCYANcircle in the upper position
The rightREDtriangle in the upper position
The rightYELLOW triangle in the lower position Here you should see a black bow shaped color appear under the eye
The rightGREENcircle in the lower position applied last
After you solve this puzzle you will experience some strange physical treatment where you learn about the Techno Virus and meet the friendly aliens The Fraction For the first time you find you are called Ward You are given aCOMMUNICATOR and you are told you must seek out The Nexus at Cydonia on Mars The Controllers are after you You ask for some protection and the aliens give you someEXTRA AMMUNITION
You are told you must sneak onto a space craft leaving for Mars because The Fraction was not able to capture the ship Someone on the crew is a Fraction mole and will help you First you have to get the bio container You need it to safely perserve the Crystal Cone The containers are stored in the hanger entry ready for uplifting You'll have to use your necklace to cause a distraction in the security system Hmmm wonder how you will do that You'll have to use your Memorizer Trust no one they tell you except them You have to smuggle the Crystal Cone secreted in a bio container inside your body
Cool
This in order that the dreaded Reptoids are unable to find it The aliens bid you a hasty farewell as they are in danger too and you set off on your mission
Note You can't save your game now until after the upcoming action sequence
When you get to the corridor with the stone walls again move down to the opposite door as quickly as possible
Walker can't run More is the pity
But click on the sensor on the right side of the door as soon as soon as you can see it
A close up of the sensor will appear
Immediately if not sooner use the Three Rings in the same sequence you last used when you opened the massive doors earlier Did you write it down My code is Blue Green Red but since it is a random code that may or may not work for you
This sequence is quick and difficult to get through
But with a few deaths inflicted by an assaulting security drone and a few additional spins down the corridor you will get the knack and will get the door open in time As soon as you do succeed in getting that door open get inside and close it quickly by hitting the switch on the left side of the door once you are facing the door inside the cabin
Go over to the screen with the red symbol and click on it Now you can read the alien language with no problem Maybe it was that Techno Virus you ingested involuntarily And you learn about using humans to find some mysterious artifact You don't need to read all this stuff to successfully complete the game
But it is interesting and informative in developing the back story
Go back into the cabin the security control area where the big hologram projector is Go back over to the console closest to the oppostie hatch In transit you notice that the security drone's laser attack on you has damaged the glass between the two rooms
Remember the console there on the right side has a ring slot Use any of your rings to bring up the chart
They work now
The ring gives you authorization to use the chart map of the Moon Base Click on the titles across the top to learn much more than you knew before about the base its occupants and its functions You will also learn a little about what has recently occurred at the Moon Base Lastly click on the LIFE SUPPORT bar
That red overlay of lines we talked about earlier designated an activated security system The oval shaped nodes near the center are the controllers If you click on the four in the center they will shut down turn blue
There are two control nodes you can't manipulate
Don't worry about these
Using the four central controllers you need to isolate the two red diamond shaped patrol drones from the area of the ventilation system that you will need to navigate to accomplish the tasks The Fraction assigned to you You must see to it that they cannot gain access to the cabin top left where you first awakened at the Moon Base
The best way I found is to leave the upper node in blue and close in the drones so they have to go up to the top of the screen there Then activate the node red so they can't get back down to the four way intersection They will patrol together vertically there until you come back to reconfigure the security system You will need to get up there to the first cabin
But there is something else you must do first
See the green anchor shaped robot symbol moving over on the left side of the screen And there's another immobile one just like it over on the right side
The robot on the left is in Sector Click on him See in the display the two patrol zones he is assigned to Change his patrol pattern to Checkpoint exh by clicking on that line He will obligingly travel right up to that point and stop
At this point the bottom node should be blue and the left and right nodes should be blue The upper node should continue in red to block the two drones up there
Exit the screen and click on the ventilation grate between the two consoles
It won't budge Well you don't have any heavy duty tools on you but you do have a laser gun Looks like its time to use it In inventory click on the laser gun click the gun on the bright pink capsule you got from the aliens as Extra Ammunition Use the gun on the grate like a torch done in a cutscene to melt the grate's attachments It falls away and you are able to enter the ventilation ducts
Crawl inside and go up the ramp to the right
When you get to the crossroad turn and go right toward the dark shape ahead That's the inactive maintenance robot When you reach him use the Blade from your inventory to remove theROBOT HANDon your left the robot's right hand
Put the Robot Hand in your inventory
Now use your Memorizer from inventory and use the scroll arrows to indicate you want comm link to maint robot Choose Transmit and click on it Then click on Receive to see the maintenance robot's routes Scroll to Route and Route individually and press Receive each time Then click on abort comm link and exit the Memorizer Go to the intersection and turn right to see a grate ahead of you It looks like white lines and buttons
You are about to jump down into the corridor outside the cabin where you woke up so you'd better be sure that you have routed the red security drones so they can't get into this area
NOTE If at any time you are blocked in here by a red flash of solid air you will have to go back to the chart and reprogram the security nodes to open for you
But be careful not to allow access to the area you are in by the red patrolling drones
You will die
When you come to the grate use your Robot Hand to unscrew the two top screws and use the handles to pull the grate free
Jump down into the passageway cutscene Go into the beginning cabin
Use the Memorizer on the floating security system sphere Select Sec
Sphere then select Sec
Level then hit TRANSMIT
Leave the cabin and use your Med Card to reenter the Med Lab
If you go to the console on the far right end of the room and use your Med Card on it you will see you can now understand the alien writing in the close up Click on Obductee's Menu after reading the contents of the Personnel Menu and Last Action report which reveals that your moon party including Higgins and Lewis we destroyed by a tractor beam
In the Obductee's Menu its pretty obvious you want to click on Security Beacon Necklace Removal right When you do you are advised that the necklace will remain active even though it has been removed The message advises you then to approach utiliturretA with subject
Of course that's our old pal with the red light in his helmet
Walk over to the medical robot
The robot will automatically remove the necklace Put theNECKLACEin your inventory and use your Med Card to return out to the passageway Climb up into the ventilation ducts again and make your way back through the shaft to the security control room where you entered the vent system
In the control room go back to the right side console and use a ring to authorize your entry to the security system once more Click on Life Support and alter the route of the two patrolling red drones to allow you access to the robot in checkpointexch
Go back into the ventilation shaft left at the intersection and left again when you come to the wall
Click on your Memorizer as you face the active robot Page the comm link to maint robot Transmit the Sectors and codes to the robot You must recieve a Transmit CRC ok message to verify this has occurred properly Exit the Memorizer Put the Necklace on the robots uplifted arm and go back to the security control room
Use your ring to access the security grid again Click on the robot you just decorated with the security Necklace Click on Sector all four patrol positions on the close up display should be lit if you transmitted Sectors and successfully and send the little robot happily off to Sector necklace in hand Nice diversion Walker
Now with the security troops and robot off on a wild goose chase you can actually use the exit hatch in the control room again Leave the cabin through the the right side hatch using the Med Card Go across the passageway and back into the microscope area the Micro Lab
You know now from what the members of the alien Fraction have told you that you must first successfully hide the Crystal Cone in the bio container in order to escape with it to Mars
Go to the central pedestal apparatus and put the bio container back on the pedestal Then walk over to the microscope Replace the Glowing Lens in the microscope Click on the yellow horizontal button to close the globe Get Blood Sample the human sample we used earlier out of your inventory and place it in the microscope Use the little control pad in the close up screen Touch the X symbol on the upper end When the next screen comes up and you can see the words human dna and also can see the white DNA strand push the far right button to bombard the pulsating matter on the pedestal bio container with human DNA
Exit the microscope Go to the pedestal and pick up the pulsating matter In inventory insert the Crystal Cone into the bio container Ah safely stored away But now you need to scramble the code to open the bio container so only you can access it Use your Memorizer on the bio container Select comm link to biocontainer Hit Transmit and receive a string of zeros as the open code
Hit abort comm link exit and then Generate a code Mine was c a he pg ty
But you only need to write down the first three to five digits or letters Just so you can identify one code from another
NOTE If you have already accidentally generated the Memorizer's capacity of three randomly generated codes while previously learning to operate the Memorizer as I did just select a code from those you see and write it down
Now use the Memorizer scramble button to scramble the code
Mine was tybt ip Write down the new scrambled code for the bio container
Make sure you note that it is for the bio container There's another container coming up later
Scroll to the comm link to bio container line Press Transmit and the zero string will display Hit transmit again to go back ot the scroll screen Scroll to the scrambled code and click on Transmit again You should now see the new scramble code Exit the Memorizer Scroll to the new code and hit Transmit again
You will see a cutscene where the bio container with the precious Crystal Cone is rather painfully absorbed through your left palm and into your body SAVE YOUR GAME
Exit the Memorizer And using your Med Card go back out through the hatch you just came in to the left of the pedestal When you are standing in the passageway put your Med Card away Then get out your Memorizer again and scroll to Sec
Level Put the Memorizer back in your inventory noting where it is in the inventory line You will need it in a big hurry
Only then is it reasonably safe to go up screen to the open area at Walker's right As soon as you enter what turns out to be the landing bay get out your Memorizer and hit Transmit to send Sec Level to the floating security sphere and disable it If you don't do this it will zap you into infinity almost immediately
Awww dead again You will now need to make some carefully planned preparations before you proceed Pick up anOXYGEN TANKto Walker's left
And pick up anOXYGEN MASKto his right Put them in your inventory Then
Get out your Memorizer and scroll to comm link to the container NOT bio container Hit Transmit then Receive to see and receive the container code

Write down the code making sure you don't accidentally duplicate the scrambled code for the bio container when you placed it inside you My container code was wix
Before you go in the container off to right screen you need to change the biocontainer code again for when it was absorbed inside you
Scroll to find that code line and scramble it again
Mine was atic j Tansmit the code

Exit the Memorizer and enter the container through the open hatch to screen right

Open the Memorizer find the container code listed under Sec Level probably and Transmit to air the container code it will activate the container doors and they will close

Put the Memorizer away in inventory and combine the oxygen mask and the oxygen tank in inventory
NOTE During the following cutscene IF you arrive on Mars and are immediately shot by the Grays and the bio container is extracted from your crumpled body the Grays found the bio container code and you didn't program it correctly in the landing bay If this happens you need to go back and rescramble the bio container code so it is not the same as the code you used to place it in your body Redo the above steps
EPISODE II THE MARS COLONY If you successfully scrambled the internal bio container code you witness a rather lengthy space travel cutscene where you eventually end up at the Mars Colony outside on some kind of gigantic platform
NOTE This episode is not linear Just make sure you keep moving talk to everyone do everything available to do gambing puzzles etc
and talk to everyone that will talk to you with every opportunity that arises
You can choose to be surly and uncooperative yourself if you wish But it may cause you more trouble Your cleverest choices in conversation will determine how quickly you are able to complete this level
It might be a good idea to reveal as little about yourself as possible until you figure out who the bad guys are And its probably not a good idea to show the secret stuff in your inventory to anyone although you will be constantly prompted to show object
Okay enough said and off we go on the path I followed Ripper a very disagreeable human being is the first to greet you sort of He takes you to the boss Jack Marshall You are informed that you are now a member of the colony and have to follow the rules You simply have to do what you are told He gives you aCHAMBER CARD Ripper takes you via a rather circuitous route past the church to the sleeping quarters in a corridor stacked with chambers Use your Chamber Card on the two left and right sensors on your far left they are not bright lit in red Depending on your answers here and elapsed time Ripper may take you to meet the Brazilian in a high tech bathroom or he may leave you to your own devices for a while
This walkthrough continues from where Jack leaves you standing in front of the chamber door
Walk into the bed chamber and click on the bed You will immediately fall asleep and have a wild dream cutscene about finding The Quickener about growing and about owning the Universe When you wake up click on the cabinet on the side wall before you exit the room You will see that this cabinet has a lock that involves a rather ominous looking slider puzzle You need something to complete the puzzle though so don't worry about it now
Leave your room and go left screen two times Talk to the man standing in front of the church door Mike Shaffer or Pighead as he is commonly known He doesn't want to talk to you You can try the hatch upscreen to the right but you can't get in Enter the church instead Walk a little forward toward the altar and not that the book laying on the altar is the Bible You may see humans periodically appearing and disappearing as you move about
But you will find that almost no one will speak with you
Leave the church out the right side doorway and continue walking left until you come to a screen that has a fountain in the back that looks like orange fire Learn that is is just another hologram Continue going left screen and see what looks like a white fountain hologram Keep going and enter the rear door with the green sensor
Now you meet the Brazilian lavatory attendant Sebastian Mezenga You can respond to him with Do I look that bad
and leave for now or you can talk to him and ask him What is happening here
He will ask you what you want to know Choose tell me about Marshall
He tells you of his own abduction and how Marshall and Jack Ripper abuse the abductees people in the Colony He tells you that people are not talking to you because Marshall has apparently made an exception of you by not taking away all your stuff And you are still wearing your flight suit which is highly valuable at the Colony
You also find out that Slash is Marshall's bodyguard and that he and Ripper are very dangerous The Greys have put Marshall in his dictator position and they are really in charge The Greys perform experiments on humans You hear of an incident where someone died oozing a golden glowing liquid The Controllers tried to clean it up but on of the abductees supposedly got a small sample before they accomplished the clean up
Sebastian tells you there are about people left at the Colony Some died in a useless revolution and others seemed to just disappear permanently Jessice Blaze is a prominent human Sebastian also mentions Dr Morgan the Preacher and the Fortune Teller These are definitely people you want to talk to soon You also learn from Sebastian that you are in an abandoned portion of the Reptoid Mars base and that both Marshall and Ripper have guns
NOTE At this point I showed Sebastian the gold Secret Symbol You know the one the little Fraction aliens gave Walker after the Floating Tile Puzzle I wouldn't necessarily advise you to do that
But if you do choose to show the Symbol to Sebastian however he will tell you NOT to show it to anyone else except maybe Hacker
You hear the church bells ring three times and you are transported to the church automatically Jessica Blaze whispers in your ear that she wants to meet with you after the church service outside the church or in the Casino Outside the church Ripper confronts you and tells you that Marshall wants to talk to you You have to go with him and when you do he resoundingly beats the daylights out of you and uses his gun apparently at stun level on you He definitely doesn't want you hanging around Jessica
You will awaken to find yourself talking to a man in a white coat Dr Morgan we presume Talk to him just briefly and he will disappear Walk back to the left two screens and enter the hatch nearest you on the other side of the room Its the Casino and piano bar Talk to Hacker who will probably show up back by the pictures on the rear wall He tells you he will talk to you later
Leave the Casino If Jessica doesn't show go back to the church going right screen until you get there Talk to Jessica in the black shorts outfit She fills you in a bit about the peoples' suspicions about you and that you appear to be in line with Marshall and the bad guys because you still have that flight suit She tells you to meet her to talk more in the Casino So go back there
When you get there talk to Hacker the guy in the black shirt and purple tie again
He is the Manager of the Casino
He will tell you that neither the Greys or the Reptoids have the knowlege to have created the bio containers You also learn that its dangerous to carry one inside you for too long as they begin to deteriorate Uh oh
When you finish with Hacker talk to Jake Palminski Radioman Learn that Jake has a crude radio But there's a force shield around the Colony that prohibits radio waves from escaping The people are able to receive incoming Earth radio transmissions Learn that the Colony is not only on Mars but at Cydonia Just where you need to be according to The Fraction Wonder if The Nexus is anywhere around Jake Radioman tells you that there are pyramids on Mars and all over the Universe They were created by a higher race called The Makers Jake tells you that the Reptoids may be aware that a bio container was taken in an uprising recently at the Moon Base you wouldn't know anything about that would you
and you should be warned not to keep asking people about bio containers Jake's radio is sitting on the counter behind him in case you want to check it out
If Rosa Martinez white shirt and jeans shows up you can also talk to her She is suspicious of the Preacher and Doctor Morgan
Go into the Fortune Telling Room at the rear of the Casino If the doctor is in there he'll want to talk to you out in the Casino Follow him out there You will learn a lot from the good doctor about Rita the Preacher the Reptoids and Greys and the so called Rebellion
NOTE Remember you don't have to talk to any of these people in a set pattern just so you get the plot to keep moving along by continually moving and questioning one person after another
Go back into the Fortune Telling Room and talk to Rita Mayden about escaping special implants are needed to be able to use the speeders You also discover that there are two groups of human Some are subjected to experiments and other are not A control group of sorts You tell Rita the story of your abuction Afterward check the cabinet on the right Whoops
Another slider puzzle
Let's leave it for later
Walk back to Rita and click on the Tarot cards on her counter You can't do much with the cards yet the Wheel of Fortune card holds the solution for the lock on the cabinet Maybe you'd better wait until Rita steps out and forgets to lock the Fortune Telling room door Go back out and play Blackjack with the Gambler in the Casino booth Good idea here to save your game before you start You can't save again until you are completely finished with this exercise You need to win his personal card and half of the Pager's card Use yourROLEX theGOLD RINGand theSILVER DOLLARas ante Try not to loose any of your other stuff

modelscrewdriverRobot HandThe silver dollar and the gold ring are bonuses or the Rolex if you win it back
If Doctor Morgan shows up in the Casino talk to him again about Pager If Jessica shows up here where she said she'd meet you later have a good long talk with her
And who is that lurking creep in the lab coat and the sun glasses anyway he's just everywhere
Rita fills you in A lot of it you have already heard from one person or another But she does put across that the Reptoids are very scary Much more so than the Greys She tells you about how she was abducted and about the biological clones put on Earth to replace people who are abducted She thinks the US Government in the form of the MIB Men In Black are working with the aliens
After this lengthy discussion with Jessica leave the Casino and walk around and talk to whoever you meet on the way across to the church
You might see Jake Radioman before you leave the Casino These people do zip around If you do see him talk to him again about the MIB Jake will fill you in on how the MIB work with the aliens to enable the abduction of people for experiments
When you get back to the church the Preacher John Hollbrook is there Talk to him about everything He wants to meet with you in his room
Ripper calls you over and tells you Marshall wants to see you this is business
Go with him You are led to Marshall's office All he does is give you a pep talk and warn you about not talking to the people at the Colony
Go back down the passageway to the church Go right screen and out the main entrance The door to the right of the main entrance is the Preacher's room
If he's not there yet wander around and talk to anyone who crosses your path Sebastian is a good target
You haven't talked to him for a while If you run across him he will probably tell you that the Casino is safe and there may be some sort of secret passageway in there somewhere
Anytime now you will get a message from someone that the Preacher is in his room and is ready to talk to you Go down to the door to the right of the church's main entrance You have a long talk with the Preacher and find out that the Reptoids may be trying to exterminate humanity all together You also find out that Pager was Jessica's boyfriend Douglas
Douglas is gone forever The Preacher has an interesting closet in his room too with a slider puzzle
But for now leave and go into the church to talk to Rosa Martinez She will tell you about her implant and more about what happened while you were on the Moon Base
Go to the lavatory and ask Sebastian about the Holy Mountain Rosa mentioned to you Leave and go wander around till you can talk to Jessica again and then meet her in the Casino Ask her everything Talk to people and watch for an opportunity to see Rita leave her Fortune Telling room and forget to lock it You need to get in there privately If you haven't had a long conversation with her yet in the Fortune Telling Room do it now
Afterward you just have to keep moving and talking and biding your time it won't be long until the Preacher tells you to go talk to Rita again in her room She should be gone this time with the door left unlocked Go in and take the Tarot cards off the counter THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE THE KING OF PENTACLESand theDEATH CARD

You can also save your game go back in and auto solve skip the puzzle to see what it should look like then go back into your saved game and try to solve it yourself There's lots of flexibility here
RITA'S LOCKER SLIDER PUZZLE SOLUTION When you exit the puzzle screen the door to the cabinet will open Move the books on the second shelf down to see a red sensor with a small slot
None of your pass cards will work Try the King of Pentacles Tarot card
Notice the vertical bar code down the center barely visible Use the card on the sensor You will see a door open behind Rita's counter Ah the secret passage at last Or at least one of them
When you are inside the Secret Chambers it might be a good idea to save your game if you haven't for a while Wander into the room to the left and pick up theNOTEBOOKfrom the side bar under the Earth painting Enter the room with the green sensor Move the book to the rear of the door sitting on a crate or box You will see the book fall off onto the floor revealing another red sensor slot You can try all your cards None will work
Leave the Fortune Telling room making sure to close the cabinet See Ripper abusing Rosa After this altercation leave the Casino and find Hacker As usual he'll want to meet you back in the Casino Talk to him and show him the Pager half card Leave the Casino and if Jake gives you a message find Rita and talk to her Or you can talk to the doctor again at this point if he appears He'll tell you about Webber Someone we haven't heard of at all until now
Now find Rita and meet her back in the Fortune Telling room
Just unload on her about finding the secret passage after she carelessly left the door unlocked
Then leave to find Rosa in the church She tells you the other half of the Pager card is in Slash's room next to your own She gives you aNOTEwith the combination to Slash's locker
Go back to the landing platform Go to the sleeping chamber area and open Slash's cabin to the right of Walker's Use the locker combination on the lock to solve the slider puzzle and open the locker Or use the solve skip or other options decribed above for the slider puzzles

But it will take a little time
Go to the Preacher's room as soon as you can find Jake the Radioman and he gives you the message that Hollbrook wants to see you Jake found a note on his radio Go to the Preacher's room again to the right of the church's main entrance Sebastian may show up and ask to talk to you at this point but its not necessary to speak with him right away
At the Preacher's door you'll see its ajar
Uh oh I'd be a little suspicious here if I were you and maybe save your game
When you get inside the hatch will close and lock you in You're trapped and the oxygen is deliberately being rapidly depleted from the cabin Try to open the door and ring the bell to the right No use It doesn't work Now
Look at the picture above the hatch in close up
See that tiny switch about midway on the right side of the picture frame
Click on it to reveal the device that operates the bell system Open the top compartment with your screwdriver

Ring the bell
You will be rescued in the upcoming cutscene Hmmm you find out that the Preacher didn't send that note Jake found attached to his radio
Leave the Preacher's room after you talk to everyone If they leave before you can do that go into the church and likely meet Hacker there He will give you theREPAIRED PAGER CARD You'll probably run into Jake again or someone else will warn you to stay out of the Casino for a while Ripper got pretty upset when his attempt to suffocate you failed Talk to Jessica too
And the Doctor
Track them down if you need to
Jessica will tell you all about what happened when Douglas Pager was abducted and about Professor Webber You find out that there are three kinds of implants the language translator the one used for mental control and the third an observation implant which is not used on human beings They work on Greys though which gives you an idea She also tells you her opinion about the MIB being controlled by the Greys rather than by the US Government She and Prof Webber have devised a method called decompression to restore people's minds
Webber is still around on the Colony His nickname is Weirdstuff
You ask Jessica about someone called The Nexus She doesn't know Find Hacker Ask him about The Nexus He doesn't know He will tell you to ask Jessica or Rita about the Inner Circle
Find Rita and ask her She'll refer you to Preacher John If Rosa shows up ask her too She knows very little but overheard something about a notebook Ask the doctor too
He'll tell you the Inner Circle might have been part of the failed Rebellion at the human Colony
About now follow Rita's advice and go back to talk to the Preacher in his room Use Pager's card on the door Go in and find the room is empty Ring the bell Leave the room and Preacher John will join you Talk to him Ask him to cover for you

Leave the Preacher's room
Go straight out to the landing platform and talk to Hacker Talk to everyone you find to talk to expecially Mike and the guy in the sunglasses and lab coat who turns out to be Professor Webber FInd Rita in the Secret Chamber behind the Fortune Telling room You must go through the liquified door again to find her Before you talk to her use the notebook you picked up earlier on the stationary notebook on the side bar to make a copy of the star chart You need it to open the locker in your room Talk to Rita She tells you there may be a bridge activator hidden somewhere in the Colony
When you leave Rita and subsequently the Casino Ripper will accost you and you'll end up in Sebastian's room with Jessica and Marshall Marshall has placed a security necklace on Jessica You'll wind up having a knock down drag out with Ripper and killing him No time for remorse after killing this sadistic creep Take hisFREEZERand hisPAGER

The trick is to wait until he turns his back to you and is facing the doors
Let him have it with the Freezer
Go over and get hisFREEZER hisPERSONAL CARD and aNOTEfrom his pockets
Go to Marshall's office and speak to Slash Convince him that you need the Data Reader from Marshall's safe Go into Marshall's office The safe is on the opposite wall

When Hacker and Jessica leave you on your own take out Marshall's Data Reader and use his Personal Card on the Data Reader
Scroll the arrow down to BRIDGE ON
Hit the Transmit button
Look at the energy bridge now in place to the right which joins the platform to the Control Room
Walk Walker across the energy bridge stopping short of going into the Control Room

Use the Data Reader again and Transmit BRIDGE ON Go back inside the Colony and someone will tell you about what has been happening to poor Preacher John Probably it will be Jake that tells you
Before you check out the Preacher you need to go see Rita She is still hiding out behind the Fortune Telling room in the Secret Chamber beyond the liquified door Rita will tell you she thinks you also have a Tracer Implant inside you You are concerned that this implant may have led to the discovery of The Fraction's secret hiding place when you and Jessica met with the High Council Your being there may have led The Controller's to them and you may have inadvertently caused the death of most of the High Council leaders
Heavy guilt trip here
Go back out and go to Walker's room in the sleeping chambers area Go to the cabinet on the left side of the room Use the Notebook you picked up in the outer area of the secret room behind the Fortune Telling room earlier in the game It will help you solve the slider puzzle for the lock By now you know how to bypass the puzzle if you so desire

Translation of the Watchmaker's Diary As year follows year I am convinced that our land is governed by men both noble and just
Yet enmity between sovereigns brings suffering to our people
From that which I have seen and that which I have read in my books only the blueblood of the knighthood and the great wisdom of the nobles have strength enough to burn and destroy the troubles of this world
My plan my great design shall be to create a new immortal kingdom
A world without end founded by men of nobility and great intellect
They shall govern with peace justice and chivalry over all peoples and their kingdom shall have no end
With my knowledge and time control apparatus I shall guarantee the immortality of their bodies and souls and the strength to hold the fiercest armies ever created in the palms of their hands
No more shall there be war pestilence or persecution of the weak and oppressed
No more shall there be lords and masters peasants and slaves or any other injustice which leads men to revolt
There shall be years of good government
With this accomplished I shall withdraw into peace and silence as I have so often dream
My eternal life giving apparatus in its most complete form appears in the guise of a Pendulum clock The energies which course through the veins of our ancient land and the path taken by wandering spirits ensure its working through eternity
The form of the Pendulum is no mere choice
On the contrary it is the clock of the soul an instrument capable of reaching a true equilibrium of the depths of the human spirits capable of of controlling the Internal Clock hidden in every man
This Internal Clock represents that part of us which silently governs the rhythms of our lives
Here is how the Pendulum can offer eternal life the internal clock is stopped leaving spirit in harmony with the running of time
My studies have separate phases
In the first phase noble men including myself shall be chosen and gathered together to receive the gift of immortality
noble hearts like the hours of my Pendulum
In the second phase I myself shall bring the pendulum to a halt causing the Internal Clock to stop inside the chosen men
They shall become immortal
The Pendulum shall be transported to a safe place and shall be buried forever
For if the strength of the eternal life is to remain
The Pendulum must never swing again
The man who gives his soul to the Pendulum and so to eternal life will acquire virtues which raise him above other mortal creatures
These virtues are linked to he Internal Clock and particularly allow Control over physical aging or the gift of eternal youth or maturity according to the Immortal's desire
Invincibility of the flesh or the gift of invulnerability
Not fire nor blade nor sword nor any mortal weapon can touch the Immortal
Physical excellence or the gift of constant perfect health never victim of disease or plague or hunger or of other pestilence which afflict our people
The Watchmaker Myself
The Elder My one and only friend and the first chosen noble in our immortal kingdom

The Greenhouse and the Well Following the opening introductory scenes you are playing as Darrel and find yourself and Victoria in the corridor outside your rooms
Take a moment toexplore your environment TheLEFTmouse button is used to examine items
TheRIGHTmouse button is used for actions picking up objects opening doors climbing stairs pulling levers starting conversations and also for getting a 'second opinion' about objects that you have examined with the left button Watchmaker is very non linear
You are free to meander around and examine things and talk with people
Very few doors are locked and the progress through the game can be estimated by observing the Time Stamp that appears whenever you change locations
This helpful function can be toggled on or off by pressing the 'D' key I recommend you leave it turned on
Each time you complete an essential segment the clock will advance
I also strongly recommend that you choose to have the Subtitles switched on there will be occasions when the audible portion of the voice track does not function and the subtitles will still be visible
I suspect the programmers missed a few items when the game was translated into English and the voice overs were recorded
Not a big deal but you will miss some information with the captions turned off In order to load a previously saved game you must first click on 'Load' in the Menu bar
Then select the one you want
If you have progressed and want to go back to check something be very cautious
You can cross your saved games and wind up very bewildered because you 'should have' already done something and now need to repeat the actions
There is an elevator lift behind you it's the Service Lift it's busy right now
There is another lift the Guest Lift in the central cobblestone area ahead of you
Take that one down to the Lobby level Floor andexit the castlevia the front entrance
Poke around
Straight ahead is the gate where you first came in
Let's call that way North
To the right East is a ramp down into the garage
You will get in there later
Go to the left West and stop to chat withRaul Hernandez He's the Gardner oops Landscape Artist
ALWAYS take the time to talk with characters and use each subject until it is exhausted
Sometimes it gets repetitious but often it triggers branches of conversation frequently essential that give you openings into other characters
Pay some attention to Who gets along with Whom and what they think of each other
Understanding these relationships will help you figure out what to do and why you are doing it
If you stay on the stone path it takes you to Henry theCaretaker'sfront door
You can visit with him if you like it's not necessary at this time but I recommend it because it will enrich your understanding
If you do visit him take theChiselfrom the shelf above his desk
If you hang a left and head South you will pass in front of the Chapel which is attached to the Castle and see Raul's residence at the South end of the path
Go left again East and soon you will approach theGreenhouse
As you do it begins to tremble
Victoria Raul and Henry run out to see what is going on
The greenhouse explodes
Examine the glass and the hole use both the right and left mouse buttons get used to doing that and make your way back toward the Castle having a look at the Aviary on the way
Find theWell and examine it and the cover
When you try toopen the cover Raul comes and warns you to stay away
He throws hisempty water bottleinto the bin
Examine the bin
Use the Close Up space view and the Shift Up arrow to lean forward and see the bottle
Take it with the right mouse button While you are right there re enter the Castle via the French Doors at the Pool
Left click and you are 'not dressed '
Right click on the pool and there is'Something Glittering'at the bottom
Hmmm
We might need toretrieve that object somehow
Go to the Diving end and talk with the Supervisor's wife Jude Anderson
Here's the non linear part For fullest gaming as Darrel ask her about everything
Then switch to Victoria F and ask her about everything again
You get much insight into the people The only essential question as Victoria ask her about Carla's private live
Darrel was too shy to ask
As either character look at the old wooden door
Meet Greta my she's a toughie
For a slightly less polite encounter have Darrel do it
Then as Darrel exit the white door at the other end of the room
Go through the Stained Glass door into the Dining Room and explore it thoroughly
On the fireplace mantel is a clock
Stand in front of the clock press lt Space gt to see close up and shift your view upwards mouse forward or up arrow and take theClock Key Then go into the other section of the dining area and open the Cupboard
Use the close up view again this time press 'Z' to squat down press 'A' to stand back up if you need to and find theCutlery Take a knife
You ARE poking around andexploring everything aren't you
That's half the fun of this game and I am not going to keep reminding you
Now exit the Dining Room the same way you came in go into the Pool Room Natatorium and straight ahead into the Guest Bathroom
TheService Liftis working now take it down to the basement level
If you poke around you find three doors
One is locked one is the Wine Cellar and the other is the Laundry
Go into the Cellar and take abottle of wine Go back upstairs and into the kitchen
As you look around the room find the pegboard with the Hook hanging on it
Use the close up view to discover theKeys If you try to take them the Cook says quot Hands Off quot Talk with the Cook
Ask him about himself and about hispast life as a sailor
Now the tricky part press Tab to open your inventory
Click on Victoria's image to bring her into the kitchen with you
Use that bottle of wine with the Cook and a cutscene ensues
While the Cook is reminiscing Victoria will take the Keys
Here's the catch
Darrel has the empty bottle and the knife items which you will be using in the lower level and Victoria has the keys to the locked room down there
You have two choices you can move both characters to the basement one at a time by switching back and forth between them so Vic can unlock the door and Dar can accomplish the tasks or you can have Vic give Dar the keys
Here's how to do that As Darrel open your inventory Tab and left click on any item
Then at the top left click on Victoria's name opening her inventory
Left click on the keys transferring them to Darrel's inventory
Then re select Darrel's inventory and click on quot Close quot Now you are still playing as Darrel and have all the required items
Note that if you Close while Victoria's inventory is displayed you are playing as her
Either character can accomplish the following Go to the Laundry Room and use the empty bottle on theDispenser

If the Gala option does not seem to appear look at the far right end of the question box
There should be a downward pointing triangle in dark red
It's hard to see
Scroll down to reveal more questions Either character can do the following
Open the cover on the well and go down into the Cistern
At the end of the passage right click on theRubbleto climb up into the next room
Look at the Machine
Use the close up view to see theIndicators
This is an important clue
Note the position of each dial
Now pull the Lever
The Indicators are all the same
This is an equally important clue just easier to remember
You can think of them as clock positions
Write it down because it will be quite a while before you use this information
What's more you will be in a hurry
Using the Close Up view press the bigButton
Boom

Go close up again to examine the contents
We'll leave the money there but take theCassette Have you noticed something
Sometimes it is impossible to switch characters or trade items
Raul's basement is one of those times
Exit the well
If you have not found theSupervisor's officeand talked with him this is a good time to do that
You can use either character but I recommend Victoria
The quickest way to find the office is to get into the Kitchen and use the other exit the one closest to the Cook
At the top of the stairs you find a Lounge area a Conference Room the Office and a locked Laboratory
Another way to get there is to use the Guest lift to Floor go through the Bar the area with the Blue Carpet and down the stairs
If you go via the Guest bathrooms you will likely run into the Caretaker
Talk with him it you haven't already
If you go via the Lounge you will likely run into Greta the Housekeeper
Talk with her if you have not already
Either way go into the Supervisor's office and have a conversation with him
When you seem to have exhausted everything and would like some privacy go to the Aviary use the other character if you like whoever it is will need the Cutters and clip the padlock releasing the Dove

Hope you're not afraid of heights
Look at the Bas Relief
There is a speck on the next section of the wall to the right of the Bas Relief
It's a weakness in thePlaster Looks like you need some sort of tool to chip away at the plaster
If you did not visit the Caretaker before you need to do that now
To save some hiking time assuming you are on the tower as Darrel switch to Victoria
She's probably still in the Old Wing and a lot closer to theCaretaker's housethan you are
She can get thechiselfor you and switch it to your inventory
