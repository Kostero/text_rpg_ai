GAME BOOMERS hints cheats and walkthroughs
The Incredible Machine Walkthroughby Larry Schneider THE INCREDIBLE MACHINE is one of the those games whose puzzle solutions can be most difficult to describe with words
Still I'm going to give it my best shot
For those of you interested in getting a hint before the proverbial beans are spilled I've tried to begin most of my solutions with just such a clue
The nice thing about most of TIM's puzzles is that many of them can be solved in several different ways
Thus I neither claim that my answers are the easiest nor the most elegant
They do work however if executed properly
I encourage you to use my solutions as a springboard to your own more imaginative Rube Goldberg contraptions
Instead of listing all of the passwords for levels through I will simply note that quot GULF quot is the password for level
Once you've entered this password for the last level TIM will allow you access to any of the game's puzzles
A word of explanation At times I may refer to a size quot x quot trampoline or conveyor belt
Size refers to the smallest or shortest of these objects size indicates that the object should be one step larger and so forth up to the maximum size size for an incline size for a conveyor belt
Thanks go to quot arzil the Good quot for his hints in getting me through the or puzzles that I found to be particularly brain busting

PUT THE BALL IN THE HOOP This puzzle provides introductory practice to using mouse motors and belts

CLIMBING A HILL This one's similar to puzzle
Fill each gap with a connected mouse motor and size conveyor belt
Then say quot So Long quot to Pokey

TURN TURN TURN
POP POP POP Okay the tutorial's behind you now comes the fun
The idea here is to properly connect all of your gears
Tie the left end of the upper seesaw to the top monkey's shade
Connect the two free gears under this monkey with a belt
Place a gear immediately to the left of the lower most gear so that they're properly meshed
Connect this newly added gear to the conveyor belt and the mouse motor to the gear at the top of the screen
Finally connect the bottom monkey to the gear immediately under the mouse motor

TRICK SHOOTING This one's interesting
Position a gun above and to the right of the top seesaw and tie it to the left end of the seesaw
This gun's bullet should hit the top baseball sending it into the container on the right
Don't hit it too squarely or it will bounce off the right wall and away from the container
Place a gun below and to the right of this same seesaw and tie it to the lower end of the top seesaw
This gun should take care of the middle baseball
Finally place a gun above and to the right of the bottom seesaw and tie it to the upper end of the bottom seesaw
Have its bullet take out the bottom baseball

SAVE THE BALLOONS This one's a cinch
Simply tie balloons and together the same way that balloons and are tied
Stringing the rope around the bottom of pulley and the top of pulley will create a sort of counterweight so that balloon will pull on and vice versa preventing either from floating too high

POP TWO BALLOONS The trick here is to drag the right most balloon to the middle of the screen
Place a pulley above and to the right of the bottom left brick roughly level with the bottoms of the balloons
Position a balloon to the far left of the screen at the same level as the other balloons and tie it to the balloon on the far right via the pulley
The left most balloon will rise and drag the right most balloon toward the gear then will swing right engaging the mouse motor

DROPPING THE BALL The gun is what will send the bowling ball into the cave
Timing is what will ensure that the pails are not in the way
Position the gun between the two pails and aim it right at the bowling ball
We'll need the use of a cannonball so tie the lower end of the seesaw to a pulley at the bottom of the screen to a lightbulb which you position to the right of the cannon
Use a magnifying glass to light the fuse
To get the cannonball to fall into the right most pail place a mouse motor just above the gun
To fire the gun place a seesaw below and to the right of the first seesaw and tie a rope from its lower left end via a pulley to the gun
Finally place a size conveyor belt just above the lower left end of the top seesaw and another one between the two seesaws to create a quot step quot that will slow down the bowling ball's progress
The bowling ball will then hit the top seesaw turning on the light and setting off the cannon bounce off the conveyor belt roll off the right end of the top seesaw onto the conveyor belt step slowing it down while the cannonball gets the pail out of the way and fall onto the upper right end of the lower seesaw firing the gun

POPPING BALLOONS ON THE MOON Plan on popping the first balloon with the left most gear the second balloon with the scissors and the third balloon with the gun
To take care of the first balloon use an incline to get it onto the trampoline and another incline above and to the left of the upper left gear to send the balloon to its doom
Position a gun to the right of the seesaw aimed at where the balloon will be when it falls on the seesaw
Tie a rope from the lower left end of the seesaw to the pulley in the lower right corner and then to the gun
The third balloon will commit suicide by teetering the teeter totter which will fire the gun at it
The second balloon will bounce off the seesaw where it will then find its point in life and death

A BASEBALL IN EVERY POT This one's simple only after you've solved it
All you need are the seesaws
Position seesaws so that their lower left ends are immediately under the baseballs on the left
Position the other seesaws so that their lower right ends are immediately under the baseballs on the right you'll have to reverse them first then position them under the baseballs
Then watch the bowling ball do its thing

WEIGHING THE SITUATION This puzzle is one of my favorites
All that's needed is to set up the pails as counterweights and time everything just right
First tie pail to pail via the pulleys above them
Then do the same with pails and
Place one tennis ball high above pail and another immediately above pail
Place the third tennis ball above pail and the cannonball on the upper right most incline
When the tennis ball falls into pail it will start falling and pail will start rising
The tennis ball falling into pail from high above should stop this motion when there's enough room under pails and for the baseball to roll underneath
The tennis ball falling into pail will raise pail
And if the timing is just right the cannonball will fall into pail raising pail when the baseball is between them

POP ALL THE BALLOONS With the help of conveyor belts and an incline we should be able to coax the first balloon to collide with the gears on the right
First place a seesaw near the bottom right corner of the screen and Kelly the Monkey to the right of the gears
Tie the lower right end of the top seesaw to the lower right end of the bottom seesaw and tie the upper left end of the bottom seesaw to the monkey's shade
Connect the monkey to the right most gear
Place two size conveyor belts immediately below the pipe the left balloon has to float up and stop under the left end of the left conveyor belt
Connect the left conveyor belt to the gear at the bottom and the right conveyor belt to the middle of the top three gears
Place a size incline pointing down and to right against the right edge of the right conveyor belt
Finally place an incline under the bowling ball
The idea is that the bowling ball will hit Pokey who will set off the seesaws and get the monkey to pedal
The left most balloon will rise and rest just underneath the left most conveyor belt until the rotating gears drive the conveyor belts and start this balloon moving to the right
It should eventually bounce off the incline and down to its destruction
Of course the balloon on the right never has a chance

PUT AWAY THE BASKETBALLS A size conveyor belt will move the balls in the right direction
Position it several spaces below the right two basketballs
Position an incline under the lower most ball so that it too will roll onto the conveyor belt
Place the mouse motor just above the lower most ball so that the top ball hits it and bounces off to the right
Connect the mouse motor to the conveyor belt and the rest is history
If necessary you can place the seesaw above and to the left of the wooden container to prevent any of the basketballs from bouncing out

FIVE GUN SALUTE The trickiest part of this machine is the correct alignment of the four seesaws
First set some balloons free by having the baseball on the screen hit a pair of scissors cutting the rope under the fourth balloon bouncing off to the right and hitting another pair of scissors cutting the rope under the fifth balloon
Use the baseball and third pair of scissors to set the second balloon free
Now the seesaws The first balloon should hit the lower right end of a seesaw whose upper left end is tied to the left most gun
The second balloon should hit the lower right end of a seesaw whose upper left end is tied to the gun just below the latter gun
The fourth balloon should hit the lower left end of a seesaw whose upper right end is tied to the lower most gun and whose lower left end is tied to the upper most gun via a pulley below and far to the right of this seesaw got that
The fifth balloon should hit the lower left end of a seesaw whose upper right end is tied to the right most gun via a pulley on the right edge of the screen
Simple huh

A FAREWELL TO BALLOONS A traditional Rube Goldberg contraption where the quot energy quot of the falling ball must be passed on from device to device until the objective is reached
In this case we'll be moving in a counter clockwise direction and ultimately break the balloon with a flaming rocket
Start by placing your fan below and to the right of the switched outlet the fan will be partially off the screen where it will blow the tennis ball to the left
The tennis ball should eventually hit and turn on the flashlight
Place a magnifying glass between the flashlight and the candle to light the candle
Position a gear immediately above the gear in the bottom right corner
Connect this gear to the right most generator and connect the nearby electric motor to the jack in the box
Connect the upper left motor to the left most generator
Connect the right most of the set of six gears to the bottom right conveyor belt

POP GOES THE WEASEL The motion of the mouse motor is what will turn the jack in the box
Indirectly connect the mouse motor to the jack in the box using pairs of meshed gears
Then arrange for the tennis ball to fall onto a seesaw whose lower left end is tied to a lightbulb to the left of the tennis ball via the pulley
The bulb should power a solar panel to the right of a fan that you position to the right of the basketball
The basketball will blow off to the left where you should arrange for it to hit a seesaw whose lower right end is tied to the lower right end of the seesaw above the mouse motor

WHEEEEEEE
Line up the trampolines
Place one trampoline to the immediate left and one trampoline to the immediate right of the bottom trampoline creating a set of three
Place a size incline just above the right side of the lower left incline to deflect the bowling ball onto the first of the set of three trampolines
Position a size incline to the left of the right most trampoline not the one you placed on the screen so the ball will eventually roll onto this trampoline
Place another trampoline immediately to its right and a seesaw whose left end is up immediately to the right of this last trampoline to keep the ball from falling beneath the pipe basket
If everything's just right the ball should eventually make its way into the basket you may have to watch it bounce for a while

POKEY AND BOB SHOOT IT OUT Once again timing is everything
Position the scissors below the top left pulley over the rope holding the left most pail
Position the second bowling ball at the top of the screen so it hits the scissors cutting the rope and bounces off to the right down the channel
The original bowling ball will follow it
You'll have to tweak the position of the bowling ball and scissors until the timing is such that the bouncing pails and or the original bowling ball block the bullets

MOUSE IN THE HOUSE Keep Mort away from Pokey
Blow Mort left with a fan so that he collides with the right edge of an incline that you position to the left of the upper piping
Place a motor below the upper right outlet and connect it to a generator positioned below the gear on the screen
Place a fan immediately below this generator to blow Mort into his house

INSIDE THE WALLS More trampoline alignment
Place a size conveyor belt under the bowling ball
Power the conveyor belt with a windmill blown by a set of bellows hit by the falling baseball
Fill the gap in the second level of piping with a trampoline and use one or two other trampolines to bounce the ball into the brick basket

TRAP POKEY THE CAT The trick is to control the direction and pace of the cannonball
To do that we'll place the cannon a little bit above the second vertical brick wall in this position the cannonball will hit the brick wall then bounce off the cannon which will give us a little more control over its movement
A magnifying glass and flashlight should be positioned to the right of the cannon keep the flashlight as low as possible
Place the scissors to the left of the top of the second vertical brick wall over the rope holding up the pail
The scissors should be pointing left
Place a size incline to Pokey's left
The bowling ball should be positioned so that it first hits the flashlight turning it on and then hits Pokey without first hitting the incline bounces off the incline and hits Pokey a second time putting the cat into position under the cage
By this time the cannonball should be hitting the scissors cutting the rope and lowering the cage
If the rope is getting cut too soon raise the cannon slightly
If necessary use an incline to deflect the cannonball into the pail and a rocket to limit the pail's movement after it falls

GOING IN THE HOLE Should be easy
Roll the top basketball left by placing a seesaw under it
Blow both balls right with a fan next to a switch operated outlet
The balloon should turn on the switch activating the outlet

HELP POKEY GET HOME The positioning of quot Pokey lures quot is crucial
Place a fishbowl immediately to the right of each of the two gaps in the brick flooring
This will get Pokey to the third level
Place a mouse on the third level to lure Pokey to the right and a fishbowl an inch or so to the right of the third level to get Pokey to walk off the edge
A mouse inside his house is all that will be needed to finally get Pokey home

RING OF FIRE This may look foreboding but all you really need to do is light one piece of dynamite
Place a size incline so that its left edge is just under the tennis ball and another incline to the left of the flashlight so that the ball hits the flashlight turning it on
Position a magnifying glass between the flashlight and the second piece of dynamite from the lower right corner and the resulting explosion will do the rest

LOWER THE BUCKET The key is to break the balloon with a lighted candle
Extend the lower brick floor with size conveyor belts to its left
Place a lightbulb and magnifying glass to the left of the candle
Position a bowling ball so that it falls onto the top seesaw whose lower end is tied to the lightbulb via a pulley below the level of the lightbulb
Place the solar panel below and to the left of the upper most gear so that its far enough right that the outlet is activated by the lighted candle and not by the lightbulb
A motor with its belt connector on the right above the outlet should be connected to the left of the bottom set of three gears and the upper left gear should be connected to the conveyor belt under the candle
The candle will then be shot to the right blowing out the balloon and lowering the bucket

PLAY A SET Once you realize how to project the tennis ball to the right the hardest part's behind you
A piece of dynamite above and slightly to the left of the tennis ball will do the trick
Now all that's necessary is to light it
With its fuse hanging over the left edge we'll be able to transport a flame to it via the rocket
The rocket will do double duty
First it must hit the scissors cutting the rope releasing the pail and turning on the flashlight which you should place to the right of the magnifying glass underneath the pail
After the rocket hits the scissors it should bounce left and land on a launching pad to the left of the magnifying glass made of a horizontal wooden block and two vertical blocks
There it will be in position to be lighted by the flashlight
The rocket will take off and ignite the dynamite blowing the ball to the right
Now all that's necessary is to elevate the ball
Place a trampoline to the left of the quot net quot slightly elevated
Place a seesaw left end down between the tennis ball and trampoline
Tie the upper right end of the seesaw to a gun placed off to the left to prevent the seesaw from tipping as the ball rolls up

YOU GOTTA SMILE Hope you found this easy
Let the tennis ball hit the balloon bouncing into a switched outlet which starts a motor attached to a gear positioned just below the right eye

SAVE BOB THE FISH The way to prevent the cannonball from destroying Bob's home is to blow out the bottom right section of wall so that the ball rolls out to the right before it hits the incline to the right of the fishbowl
Place the dynamite on the small brick shelf near the bottom center of the screen with its fuse sticking out to the right
Place a baseball in the gap above the flashlight
Position a magnifying glass to light a candle that you've placed on top of the conveyor belt
Position Kelly the monkey above and to the left of the candle Kelly should be facing left
Tie the lower right end of the second seesaw to the monkey's shade via a pulley located below the monkey
Connect Kelly's bicycle to the conveyor belt and you and Bob should be all set

FETCH A PAIL The tough part of this puzzle is getting the right pail on the right side
We'll transport it there using the conveyor belt at the bottom of the screen
First position a mouse motor on the right side of the screen along with three vertically meshed gears to its left and two horizontally meshed gears on the third brick shelf from the bottom right
Connect the mouse motor to the first of the three vertically meshed gears
Connect the third of the three gears to the conveyor belt under the right pail
Connect the second of the three gears to one of the gears on the brick shelf
Connect the last gear to the remaining conveyor belt
Dropping a ball on the mouse motor will send both pails off to the left
The left most pail should fall to the left of the brick wall and the right most pail should fall to the right
Place another mouse motor on top of the left side of the second conveyor belt from the bottom and connect it to the bottom conveyor belt
The right most pail should strike the mouse motor and fall to the activated conveyor belt on the bottom throwing it right

EXERCISE KELLY THE MONKEY The object here is to hit the seesaw tied to Kelly's shade with a rocket
Place a trampoline under the left most cannonball and have it bounce into a mouse motor the mouse should be facing right connected to a size conveyor belt in the column under the second cannonball
The mouse motor should send this cannonball to the adjacent column to its right where it should land on a trampoline and bounce up and off a seesaw at the top of the column into the next column to the right tie the lower left end of this seesaw to the upper right end of the seesaw below and to the left to prevent it from tipping
The rest is easy the cannonball should land on a flashlight pointed at a magnifying glass and a rocket positioned on the piece of pipe in the lower right corner

FEELING A LITTLE OUT OF SORTS This puzzle doesn't require so much timing as it does time
How to position the seesaws inclines and such just right
Try this Place a size incline spaces under the first ball deflecting it to the right
Place a seesaw spaces above the wooden floor with its fulcrum lined up between the second and third balls
Position a size incline spaces under the fourth ball deflecting it to the left
Place a size incline on the wooden floor under the fifth ball deflecting it to the right
Position a size incline spaces under the sixth ball deflecting it to the left
Finally place a size incline under the seventh ball deflecting it to the right
If you did everything right the following should happen The third ball should be the first to hit the seesaw
It should hit the seesaw's right side a moment before the second ball hits the seesaw's left side and bounce over to the right hole
Upon hitting the right side of the seesaw it will flip the second ball off to the left hole
Next the first ball should hit the seesaw's center point and bounce off to the right hole
Then the fourth ball should hit the seesaw's left side flipping it down and bounce off to the left hole
The fifth ball should hit the incline on the wood floor and bounce off to the right hole
The sixth ball should hit its incline and roll underneath the seesaw to the left hole
And lastly the seventh ball should hit its incline and bounce over to the right hole
Nothing to it

POP POP POP POP AND
POP Not as bad as it seems once you realize that conveyor belts should be positioned under the balloons
Place size conveyor belts under the balloons leave space between the conveyor belts and the balloons extending off to the left
Position a magnifying glass above the middle of the left most conveyor belt and a flashlight to its left
Drop a baseball onto the flashlight to light the candle that has fallen onto the left most conveyor belt
The ball should bounce off the flashlight to the left where it should land onto a trampoline to the left of the left most conveyor belt bounce up into the air and onto a mouse motor sitting atop the two left most gears all of this is necessary in order to stall the movement of the conveyor belts while the candle gets lit
Connect the mouse motor mouse facing right to the conveyor belt and watch the pops

REPLACING BOB'S BOWL Bounce the cannonball over to Bob
First place a size conveyor belt under it connected to a mouse motor situated above the balloon mouse should face left
Position a size incline next to the incline that's below left of the cannonball to form a quot V quot
This will move the cannonball past the first vertical channel
Next place a size incline pointing up and to the right below and to the right of the pulley to once again prevent the ball from rolling into the center channel
After a moment the cannonball will quot fall through quot the vertical wall under the pulley where you should arrange for it to land on a trampoline
The ball will then bounce into the channel under Bob where another trampoline will complete the solution

TRAP MORT THE MOUSE This puzzle requires just a little tweaking
Have the tennis ball fall onto a switched outlet which turns on a fan blowing the ball left
Use the boxing glove and seesaw to send the ball onto a trampoline on the floor under the scissors

RED ALERT
A lighted candle is the trick to lighting all of the rockets
And there are plenty of tools to work with
I placed my candle on a size conveyor belt immediately to the left of the lip on the lower brick floor
A bowling ball falling onto a seesaw lights a bulb which lights the candle via a magnifying glass of course
A cannonball falls from on high to give the candle time to light onto a mouse motor connected to the conveyor belt which sends the lighted candle to the right to create the fireworks

SET OFF FIREWORKS Speaking of fireworks this one's a bit trickier than since you have to set off a chain reaction
Place a flashlight under the baseball to light the rocket in the bottom right corner
The rocket should crash into Bob the Fish which will lure the Pokey the Cat onto the level with Mort the Mouse
Mort will run off to the left where he should fall onto a pair of scissors placed so as to cut the rope holding up the pail
Have the pail fall onto the dynamite plunger blasting the tennis ball up into the air make sure the dynamite is below and ever so slightly to the right of the ball and onto a trampoline at the bottom of the narrow pipe channel under the switched outlet
The ball should switch on the outlet which should start an electric motor connected to a generator which should power on a fan blowing a windmill connected to the jack in the box
All that's left is to have the cannonball fall onto a flashlight next to the magnifying glass

PUNCH THE BUCKET Which balls to use
How about the bowling ball in the top right the baseball and the cannonball in the bottom left
Place a seesaw with its lower right end under the baseball and another seesaw with its lower left end under the cannonball in the bottom left
Position a size incline four spaces under the bowling ball and adjacent to the far right wall
The bowling ball will deflect to the left and land on the seesaw flipping the baseball into the gap between the incline and the short vertical block to the right of where the baseball was
The baseball will roll down the lower channel onto the seesaw where it should flip the cannonball into the channel on the left
There you should use a trampoline at the bottom of the channel and a seesaw with its upper right end at the top of the channel to direct the cannonball into the boxing glove

HAPPY SECOND BIRTHDAY This solution is pretty much the same as that for puzzle
Have the cannonball fall onto a trampoline and bounce into the upper right end of a seesaw
This should deflect the ball into a boxing glove to the left of the pail

LET MORT OUT OF THE BOX This should be more like quot Blow Mort Out of the Box quot Place a trampoline under the baseball and a boxing glove above it to deflect it right onto a dynamite plunger blowing a hole in the bottom left corner of the box
The ball should then bounce back to the left onto a seesaw whose upper right end is tied to Kelly the Monkey inside the box
Kelly's pedaling should then drive a conveyor belt placed under Mort at the bottom of the box sending Mort to the left down into the hole and oblivion

EXERCISE ALL FOUR MICE In this puzzle you not only have to exercise all mice but you must get them running simultaneously
The resulting solution is a relatively symmetrical one Position a seesaw so that it's centered under the vertical wall separating the two basketballs
This will cause each basketball to perpetually flip the other into the mouse motors in the center
Connect these two mouse motors to size conveyor belts under the tennis balls and send one down the brick chute to the left and the other down the brick chute to the right
Send each tennis ball down a combination size and size incline so that they land right on top of a trampoline at the bottom of each pipe chute
There the tennis balls should eventually make there way up to the mouse motors at the far left and right
Make sure the size inclines are adjacent to the trampolines this will ensure that one tennis ball doesn't stop bouncing before the other tennis ball has reached its mark

LOWER THE BOOM Drop the pail into the quot hole quot at the bottom center of the screen
You only need to use one of the cannons here
Have the baseball fall onto a seesaw whose upper left end is tied to a lightbulb next to the cannon on the right
Use the lightbulb with a magnifying glass to ignite this cannon and position a pair of scissors so that the ejected ball hits the bottom of the scissors cutting the rope and releasing the pail
If necessary line up a couple of pieces of pipe to direct the falling cannonball into the pail

CAT A PULTING Another timing puzzle
Here you must first lower the middle bucket with the cannonball then quot punch quot Pokey off the right edge of the brick floor
Position a seesaw with its lower right end just under the left edge of the cannonball
Center a horizontal piece of pipe over the bucket that's suspended just under the gap in the brick floor
Place a basketball to the right of the suspended bucket in the top left corner of the screen and have it fall onto a size incline
Lastly place a boxing glove to Pokey's left
The basketball should roll down the incline and fall onto the seesaw flipping the cannonball into the air where it will hit the metal piping and fall down into the bucket
This bucket will fall and raise the bucket blocking Pokey's path
In the meantime assuming the basketball built up enough momentum it should bounce over to the boxing glove scooting Pokey off the right edge and down below

PUT MORT IN PRISON Cut the rope holding up the cage blow up the wooden flooring and you're home free
You can cut the rope by positioning two size inclines end to end to lead the baseball onto a pair of scissors pointing right
A trampoline under the dynamite should bounce and deflect it onto the wooden shelf above Mort
Tie the gun to the upper left end of the seesaw and aim it at the ultimate destination of the dynamite
All that's left is to delay the bowling ball's arrival onto the seesaw via a couple of size inclines and maybe a mouse motor

ELIMINATE THE BALLOONS A fairly simple puzzle complicated by the fact that Kelly is preventing the baseball from directly falling onto the seesaw
So use a size incline to send the baseball right bouncing off the tip of the cannon onto a size incline leading the ball back to the left where it can fall onto a size incline positioned below and to the right of Kelly and finally deposited onto the seesaw
Alternatively you can have the baseball turn on a flashlight and with the help of a magnifying glass ignite the cannon positioning of the flashlight and magnifying glass is very tight then use a size incline under the first gap in the wood floor to roll the cannonball to the right down and to the left into the boxing glove a pair of size inclines can then be used to get the basketball onto the seesaw
With the help of a rope tied from the seesaw to Kelly's shade start Kelly bicycling
Connect Kelly to the first of three meshed gears above and to the left of the conveyor belt the third of which should be connected to the conveyor belt
This will then help convey a dire message to the balloons

LAUNCH ALL THE ROCKETS Use the baseball and basketball
With the help of a size incline roll the baseball onto the seesaw whose lower right end is tied via a pulley to a lightbulb magnifying glass combination in the bottom right to ignite the two rockets there the space is a little tight
Similarly position a seesaw under the basketball and tie its lower right end via a pulley to a lightbulb magnifying glass combination in the bottom left to ignite the rocket there

FIRE THE CANNON Perhaps this puzzle should be more aptly titled quot Try Lighting the Flashlight with the Baseball quot Actually this puzzle is not too bad
Have the ball hit the lower left end of a seesaw onto a mouse motor conveyor belt combination which should whoosh it off to the left and down
There it should collide with another mouse motor conveyor belt combo which should whoosh it back to the right
Use another conveyor belt to direct the ball into the wooden channel and onto the flashlight

BREAK BOB'S FISHBOWL Chain reaction time again
Have the boxing glove hit a mouse motor connected to the generator which should power an electric motor connected to a the single quot free quot gear
Deflect the tennis ball with a fan or two so that it falls on top of the flashlight which then shines through a magnifying glass ignites the dynamite and does Bob in

KNOCK IT OFF Keep it simple
Have the falling baseball drop onto a conveyor belt leading to the baseball on the wooden block
Connect this conveyor belt to the mouse motor
Deflect the floating balloon into the mouse motor with a gear positioned against the bottom right corner of the lower conveyor belt
Baseball in the side pocket
TEN NINE EIGHT IGNITION SEQUENCE START You may not like my solution
The puzzle goal says that you should quot make the rocket fly off the top of the screen quot It doesn't actually say you have to ignite it
Position a seesaw so that the rocket falls on its lower right end and the cannonball falls on its upper left end
Flip the rocket onto a trampoline
Up up and away

MORT TRAP This puzzle's not terribly different from
Connect the gear to the conveyor belt under Pokey and mesh this gear with another gear connected to the mouse motor
Have Pokey land on a seesaw tied via the pulley to the gun
Place a stick of dynamite under the cage to blow up the brick and land the cage on Mort
You'll need to position an incline on the lower piping to keep Pokey from eating his dinner too early

SHEDDING SOME LIGHT The first seesaw's connected to the first pulley
The second seesaw's connected to the You got the idea
First place a mouse motor under bowling ball have the mouse face left and connect the motor to a conveyor belt under bowline ball
Tie lightbulb to pulley the first of the triplet of pulleys to the right end of seesaw
Tie lightbulb to pulley to the right end of seesaw
Tie lightbulb to pulley to the right end of seesaw
Tie lightbulb to the pulley in the bottom left corner to the pulley in the top left corner to the left end of seesaw

SAVE THE BOB SQUAD Another simple puzzle whose layout is trying to make you think that the solution is a complicated one
All you need to do is deflect the left cannonball with a seesaw and cut the rope connected to the lightbulb with a baseball scissors combination
The worst part is waiting for TIM to realize you've solved the puzzle

THE WOODEN SHAFT The trick here is to compress the bellows with a balloon powered seesaw
Have the tennis ball drop onto the upper left end of a seesaw on the brick floor and ricochet into a pair of scissors setting the balloon free
The balloon should collide with the lower left end of a seesaw whose lower left end is about of an inch under the tip of the bellows
The rising seesaw will set off the bellows which should blow a windmill connected to a generator powering a motor connected to a conveyor belt placed under all three baseballs

LAYING DOWN A BUNT More like blowing down a bunt
Have the cannonball drop onto a seesaw tied to a lightbulb
The lightbulb should shine on a solar paneled outlet which should power a fan blowing the baseball to the left
Direct the ball into the bucket with one or two carefully placed pieces of pipe

A PIRATE'S LIFE FOR ME Free the candle
Center a mouse motor mouse facing right on the brick flooring directly under the tennis ball
Next position a flashlight above the mouse motor so that the tennis ball first hits and turns on the flashlight and then bounces to the right without directly hitting the mouse motor
The flashlight should shine through a magnifying glass so that it can ignite a stick of dynamite sitting on the left side but not too far to the left of the brick shelf below the candle
After the explosion which should free the candle but not disturb the mouse motor the candle should fall onto a size conveyor belt centered two spaces below the brick shelf where the dynamite was sitting
There the candle will also be lit by the flashlight
Meanwhile the falling baseball should hit a pair of scissors freeing the balloon so that it's not in the bouncing tennis ball's path
Have the tennis ball bump into another pair of scissors and bounce back to the left where it can collide with the mouse motor
Connect the mouse motor to the conveyor belt and the candle will be delivered to its appointed destination
Alternate Instead of deflecting the tennis ball to the right and back to the left into the mouse motor use a series of seesaws to delay the cannonball's collision with the same mouse motor connected to the conveyor belt

CHASE AWAY THE MICE I found this one to be especially mean
That cannonball has to perform three tasks turn on the fan start a conveyor belt and set off some dynamite
Use a block to fill in the gap to the right of the upper mouse
Place three size inclines to create a path from the opening in the sidewall below the tennis ball up toward the mouse motor
Position a size conveyor belt to Pokey's left connect it to a gear placed beneath Pokey's wooden perch meshed with a second gear connected to the mouse motor
Have the cannonball flip on a switched outlet powering a fan blowing at Pokey
The cannonball should then bump into the left side of the gun placed above the mouse motor pointing right bump into and set off the mouse motor fall onto the triplet of inclines roll into the sidewall gap where it should fall onto a dynamite plunger blowing up the horizontal brick lip on the left center side of the screen and finally roll off the side of the screen
Meanwhile Pokey gets thrown to the left toward the mouse and the two of them subsequently fall through the hole in the flooring
Position a size incline under the dynamite wiring allowing enough room underneath it for the mouse to sneak through but not enough room for Pokey
For an even greater challenge skip this last incline and try to get the cannonball to arrive in the bottom left corner of the frame about the same time that Pokey and the mouse do
Then the cannonball can intercede between Pokey and the mice

BLOW UP This solution is similar to puzzle
Place a seesaw beneath each of the three inclines under the bowling ball
Each of the three seesaws should have its left end down and their fulcrums should be lined up directly under the bowling ball
Place two more seesaws between the inclines on the right so their left ends are pointing up
Place a sixth seesaw below the lower right incline so that it's upper left end barely lines up underneath the upper right end of the bottom seesaw on the left
At this point if the solution is started the bowling ball should hit each seesaw and finally set off the boxing glove
Once this is in place position five pulleys just under the lower end of each of the first five seesaws
Tie the lower ends of the first five seesaws via their corresponding pulleys to the top five guns
Tie the upper end of the sixth lower right seesaw to the sixth gun via a pulley positioned under pulley
Now as the seesaws are flipped the guns will be fired and the first six sticks of dynamite set off
Place a magnifying glass and lightbulb to the right of the candle
Tie a rope from the lightbulb to a pulley beneath the brick flooring yes it can fit to the lower right end of the sixth seesaw
When the sixth seesaw flips firing the sixth gun it will also turn on the lightbulb lighting the candle which will set off the last stick of dynamite after being hit by the boxing glove

BALLOONS IN DANGER The trick to this puzzle's solution is understanding that a balloon will not only break upon being hit by a flying bullet but that it will also prevent that bullet from hitting anything else
That said place a balloon to the right of the third gun as close to the brick wall as possible
Position the scissors over the rope tied to the third gun and place a second balloon under the scissors
This balloon should hit the scissors cutting the rope and be deflected toward the first balloon positioned above
The first balloon will stop the first balloon the second balloon the second and the third gun will never fire

GETTING THE BALLS TOGETHER
This can be pretty sticky until you figure out how to have the basketball both nudge the bowling ball off the edge and follow it
The trick isn't to put the basketball on the incline but rather to place it above and right of the bowling ball's center
Then the falling basketball will knock the bowling ball off bounce to the right onto the incline and then roll off itself
Position a mouse motor against the wooden wall one space below the bowling ball and connect it to a size conveyor belt positioned several spaces below the baseball
After the bowling ball hits the mouse motor have it flip a seesaw whose fulcrum is diagonal space away from the bottom left corner of the mouse motor
Place a trampoline just above the incline at the mouth of the hole to the right of the balloon
Both the bowling ball and basketball should bounce off the mouse motor onto the seesaw bounce onto the trampoline and into the hole
Position a magnifying glass and flashlight to the right of the cannon fuse
Place a stick of dynamite on the wooden flooring above the flashlight and a gun to its left tied to the lower right end of the seesaw
When the bowling ball lands on the seesaw the gun will be fired exploding the dynamite and providing a path for the baseball to fall down onto the flashlight setting off the cannon

FREE POOR POKEY THE CAT This is another puzzle whose solution can be elusive
The trick behind raising the cage is dropping the cannonball into the bucket
And the trick to flipping the cannonball off the seesaw is to tie a balloon to the seesaw's lower end
First the easy stuff
Position a size incline pointing up from right to left with its bottom point directly on top of the right balloon so that the balloon bounces off the third mouse motor into the second mouse motor
Tie the bucket to the cage via the two prepositioned pulleys
Finally don't have the cannonball fall onto the prepositioned seesaw it's too low
Instead position another seesaw whose lower right end is immediately under the cannonball and tie that end to the balloon in the lower left corner
Use a size incline to bounce this balloon off the side of mouse motor then let it rise and pop the cannonball off the seesaw and into the bucket

PUT THE BALLS INTO THE BASKETS Figuring out where to position a seesaw tied to the right balloon in order to activate the lower mouse motor is the secret here
Place the seesaw just above the opening to the smaller wooden basket and tie its lower left end to the right balloon
Then connect the lower mouse motor to the conveyor belt under the basketball
Connect the upper mouse motor to the upper conveyor belt under the bowling ball via a pair of meshed gears in order to reverse the direction of the conveyor belt
Also place another seesaw so that its lower left end is adjacent to the lower right corner of the vertical piece of brick that's roughly center screen
This should deflect the bowling ball into the taller basket

BASKETBALL ON THE MOON A jack in the box will perform the foul shot
Place it immediately under the basketball and connect it to the left most gear
Connect the meshed gear to Kelly's bicycle which you should locate just below the gears
Tie Kelly's shade to the cage and blow up a stick of dynamite placed under the cage using the flashlight magnifying glass and baseball

BREAKING DOWN THE WALL The title says it all
But how and where to position the dynamite
My idea is as follows Position the trampoline so that it is adjacent to the brick wall and its legs are level with the cannon muzzle
Position the dynamite just above the trampoline
The bowling ball should fall onto the seesaw whose upper right end pulls on a lightbulb located just to the left of the highest piece of brick above and to the left of the trampoline and whose lower left end turns on a lightbulb via the lower pulley located to the left of the cannon
The lightbulb by the brick should light the dynamite via a magnifying glass positioned close to the lightbulb and naturally the other lightbulb and magnifying glass should light the cannon
Tweak the positions of these various objects until the cannonball safely makes its way into the bucket

BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE GO THE BALLS It's all in the positioning
Place one trampoline at the bottom of the far right well under the basketball
Place another so that's it level with the top of the adjacent well to the left
Deflect the basketball to the left of the first well by placing a size incline high above the first well so that half of the incline is off the top of the screen
Then play with three more trampolines
I put one just to the left of the bottom of the wells a second above and to the right of the pipe basket and a third just to the right of the pipe basket

LIGHT MY FIRE Light the rocket and fly it sideways
Have the cannonball fall onto the left side of a flashlight and bounce to the left
The flashlight should light the candle via a magnifying glass the cannonball should bounce onto a size conveyor belt and then land on a mouse motor the conveyor belt prevents it from landing on the mouse motor prematurely connected to the gear above and to the left of the candle
Mesh two more gears to the right of this gear and connect the third of the three to the lower right conveyor belt under the rocket and the second of the three to one of the pair of gears above the rocket
The second of the pair of gears should connect to a size conveyor belt positioned immediately under these two gears
Thus the candle is lit then shifted right on the conveyor belt to light the rocket which takes off and hits the upper conveyor belt moving it to the left
Use a size incline then a pair of unpowered size conveyor belts following by another size incline to continue to move the rocket to the left lighting the four candles sitting on the brick pedestals
The candle that originates in the top left corner the last one to be lit by the rocket should fall onto the upper left end of a seesaw whose lower right end turns on a lightbulb via a pulley beneath the brick flooring
This lightbulb in conjunction with a magnifying glass can be positioned near the bottom left corner to light the remaining two candles

REMOVING THE PATTERN Perhaps this one should be called quot Tweak till Your Blue in the Face quot I placed a pair of scissors pointing left just above and to the right of the the farthest right pulley in the cross
I placed one cannonball so that it dropped immediately into the left bucket and the second cannonball above the right bucket and just under the top piping
This way the second cannonball falls into the right bucket at exactly the same time that the bucket itself bumps into the scissors cutting the rope don't let the cannonball hit the scissors and bounce away from the bucket
Then it's a matter of watching the puzzle unravel

PUT THE CAGE IN THE HOLE Swing your cage to the left then promenade back to the right
Tie a rope so that the falling bucket fires the gun at the cage and the bucket hits the mouse motor
The cage should be tied to the hook under its wooden base
Place a size conveyor belt just above but not right on top of the wooden flooring at the bottom of the screen so that the right edge of the conveyor belt lines up with the hook
Place a size conveyor belt right on top of the wooden flooring at the bottom of the screen so that its left edge lines up with the scissors' red handles
Fill the gap between the wooden incline and the brick with a size conveyor belt
Now wire it all up
Connect the mouse motor to the far right gear the far left conveyor belt to the far left gear the lower middle conveyor belt to the bottom gear and the lower right conveyor belt to the third of the top four gears
The cage should be shot off the side of its wooden base and land on the first conveyor belt
It should then fall off the right edge of this conveyor belt and just hang there by the rope until the baseball hits the scissors and cuts it free
The cage should then fall onto the lower conveyor belt move right climb the incline onto the last conveyor belt and be dumped into the hole

SAVE MORT FROM THE CATS This one's nothin' compared to the last few
When Mort falls through the first gap have him bump into a mouse motor mouse facing right and fall to the left toward the gears onto a size conveyor belt whose left edge is immediately above the far right gear
Connect the conveyor belt to the mouse motor and Mort's problems are behind him

UP UP AND AWAY Lots of options and lots of red herrings
But when you figure that all you need is for the lower baseball to fall onto the flashlight the problem gets easier
Keep the cannonball from blocking the gap by placing a size conveyor belt immediately below it
Roll the baseball left by placing a seesaw immediately below it
The baseball should land on a size conveyor belt connected to a mouse motor mouse facing right off to the left
The rolling basketball should hit the mouse motor before the baseball rolls off to the left
Once the mouse starts motoring the baseball will get thrown to the right down the hole and onto the flashlight
Then all you need is a magnifying glass and patience while you wait for quot More Incredible Machines quot coming to a store near you in early '

Walkthrough Level
Canyonlands This level is more introductory I would say for the gamer to get used to the controls
Your goal is to reach the camp on top of the mountain with a jeep and a helicopter
On your way pick up blue and red crystals gold and silver idols and pieces
All treasures have some equivalent and at the end of each level you can buy some useful things medikits and ammo on the money you earned during the level
You can usually locate treasures near skeletons just watch carefully
There are two snakes in this level kill them both
If a shake bites Indy use an antidote to stop the poison spreading over the body and affecting health
Don't be in a hurry before going to the next area explore the current one look for the treasures
Move along a mountain path climb above pull a block inside a wall of the next area a passage will be revealed
Before going any further get on top of the block and take Treasure silver coins from the niche
Move along path use your whip to climb on the ledge
Kill a snake when you enter the area with a ruined building and take Treasure a blue jewel in the niche on the right
Use your whip to get on top of its roof it breaks and Indy falls down skeleton in the room and down again in the water
The current will carry you to the waterfalls
Explore the underwater niche to the left and pick up Treasure a silver idol
Swim into the tunnel behind you
It takes you to a green well
Acquire some Treasure gold coins from a skeleton and get on top of the area using stairs ledges in the wall
You will finally appear near the ruins again
You don't need a whip to get on the roof this time
Explore the room with the skeleton claim Treasure a gold bar and jump into the water
Get out of the water at the waterfalls you will see a chopper passing above on its way to the mountain camp
Look around for some Treasure a blue gem in the passage on the left Treasure a red gem in the passage straight ahead
Continue along the last passage on the right
Before climbing the first ledge crawl into the room and pick up Treasure a golden idol
Return Go straight till you find a skeleton at the end and collect Treasure gold coins
You will have to jump several times across the gap use a couple of ladders and shimmy along the crack in the wall to get to the highest platform
Kill the snake get the last Treasure a blue gem in the niche high above and jump across the chasm towards the arch
You can see a camp behind it
After conversation Sophia Hapgood will give you a piece of some ancient mechanism and the level will end Indy will fly to Babylon Level Babylon Russians are sniffing around all over the ruins at this level
You will have to pass through all Soviet outposts get inside the base and find your way to the ancient Babylonian Library
At the end of the level CIA agent will help you with the library key in exchange of your cooperation with the government against Russians
On your way pick up medikits anti poison substances weapons from the dead bodies and don't forget about the treasures of course
There are several locations with explosives and barrels with liquid fuel on this level use them wisely I mean shoot'em all many good russian soldiers will not see the dawn
Cross the ditch using the central columns
Move towards the area with a tower and climb a wall on your left
Then jump on top of the roof of the nearest building and listen to conversation of Gennadiy Volodnikov russian general who's behind of all the story
Continue jumping to the next roof shimmy on the wall you will see a camp with guards
Move into the cave on the right it leads to a two storey building with a deep trench filled with water
There's nothing deep down there
There's also nothing on the right hand side of the building except two spiders
Walk to the left side Hang on the ledge and fall down grabbing the ledge below
Pull up and kill a spider at the end of the corridor
Start shooting as you enter the cave the barrel will blow up and kill russian guard
Another one will appear soon it's easy to shoot him from inside the cave
Now run to the left towards the narrow gates area and kill all other pursuing guards one by one
Get down to the camp and find some medipacks
Continue up the ladder
At the end of the corridor jump down and kill another guard behind the tent
Now pull the level in the niche it opens the gate take all three medikits and kill a spider in the tent
Continue through the gate push and climb on top of the box Indy will step on the roof
You can sneak inside the russian base if you jump on top of the truck
When the truck stops a heavy battle with guards and a sniper on the second floor starts
Shoot the barrels and try to stay alive
To kill a sniper run inside the far building and climb up the box
From here you can reach the nd floor
Pick up Treasure a green gem
Now pick up all the ammunition and continue down the stairs with the dead sniper
Use your whip to jump over the gap and climb down a ladder
Now pull up you're in the base area
Kill everyone inside
Collect Treasure silver coins in the dark room
The gate is closed
Find a niche with russian letters LFI Leningrad Physics University and pull the lever
Immediately several guards will rush inside the base prepare to meet them with your guns loaded
Explore the area take medikits on top of the boxes outside the internal gate
If you look down the bars in the floor you will see water your next step
Run through the opened gate pull out the box and crawl inside a revealed passage
Beneath is a two level watery tunnel which finally leads to the library's sealed door
Under water you can find some Treasure a silver bar Treasure gold coins medikits but the point is to swim as much deep as possible and find a way out to the next area
You can swim up and grab some air in the corners of the tunnel where you saw bars in the floor
Get out of the water
Explore the corridor with the sealed door a guard will appear and try to imprison you
Time for CIA agent to enter the scene
He will supply you with the key to the door
Inside you will see a lot of explosives shoot some barrels from the distance and jump into the hole after the explosion
In the water dive deep down and take Treasure a gold bar
Now get on top of the area using ledges in the walls
In the room pull out a box from the wall and a central floor square will become an elevator and take you deep under the ground
Explore a small room with a gold disk on the wall and attach a part of lady's mechanism to the construction inside the wall
Also check out a strange geometrical slot in the opposite wall you will have to install all the pieces of the puzzle inside this slot later
Now the elevator is fully operational
The floor goes slightly up and it is possible to climb to the above tunnel from top of the elevator's box
You're in the ancient library Why library
Your task is to gather three pieces of the geometrical puzzle after it Indy will be able to read some ancient manuscript and the precious gold statue of Murdock
You will give the statue to the CIA agent on the surface later in exchange of your jeep
By the way don't forget to look for precious Treasure a red gem and Treasure a silver idol inside niches with skeletons and of course before jumping down clear the floor out of deadly insects
Climb up the ladder to the second plane and push the box in the wall outside towards the center of the room
Climb on the box now you're able to reach the bridge on the topmost floor
Explore this side first and take the first piece of the puzzle
Get Across to the other side and take the second piece bridge will break down
Carefully jump to the left a ledge with a square niche in the wall with Treasure a red gem
From that point you can jump to the central column in the room and push the button on top
It will open a passage below on the floor jump down and crawl inside to claim the Murdock statue
Now use the ruined bridge pieces to climb into the deadly corridor with the last piece of the puzzle
Crawl or be dead
Return to the room with the gold disk near the elevator and apply all the pieces of the puzzle to the slot in the wall a hall opens behind the elevator
Collect the prizes Treasure a blue gem and Treasure a golden idol
Push the box out of the elevator's floor then punch the elevator button to get to the surface
You will see the sun and the shining smile of cunning CIA agent of course
Give him the statue and take the jeep
Your next appearance is scheduled in the snowy region of Tian Shan river USSR Level The Tian Shan River Indy lands on the snowy slope to continue his quest for ancient inferno machine pieces
On this level you get acquainted with wolfs you can't kill them just shoot in the air and they will run away
Otherwise Indy will be seriously bitten
At first you must shoot the guards and cross the border but the second part of the level is dull enough you will have to gather candles down the river and put them all in one candleholder in order to cross the bridge
Avoid icy water in the river you will be dead at once
However you can navigate the current with an expandable boat
If it gets damage from the sharp rocks you can repair it with a repair pack
You can't use anything else from the inventory while in the boat for example a lighter
To expand the boat step very close to the water and select it in the inventory
To dock press Ctrl when near the shore
If last time you left the boat it had holes damage it will still have the same amount of pumped air inside when you use it next time till you fix it with a repair pack
Explore the nearest cave and take Treasure gold coins and a health leaf
Follow the snowy slope
Keep shooting in the air while moving to avoid the wolf
Jump down Climb Up and follow the tracks of the red army truck until you see the USSR border stop sign
Pick up Treasure silver coins on your way above the ladder
The border is guarded with soldiers and the best way to handle them is from the hill on the left
You can see a small passage to the left with another wolf
Climb the ledge and you will be at the same level with the guard on the tower platform
Kill him hop down and kill another one patrolling below
The third guard is across the bridge and he's got a rifle
You don t need to open the gate
From the hill jump to the tower's top platform and kill the last guard on your way down the building
Explore the rooms and the vent shaft
One passage leads to the room with Treasure a cash box another to the lockers with repair packs medikit and an expandable boat
Open the water gate and swim down the river in the boat
After the rope bridge find Treasure a silver idol behind the waterfalls
Try to avoid rocks but it doesn't matter a lot
You will be able to fix the boat later
Get out of the river take Treasure silver coins behind the stone and follow the path crossing the bridge
On your left you will see an arch and a strange candleholder
Your goal is to put all the candles in its slots and light them up with the lighter press Ctrl with your lighter near the candle
After it the bridge will become functional and Indy will cross the river
Now go back to the other end of the broad passage you will see two more soldiers a small house and a wolf
Explore the lockers inside the house you will find a medikit and unlimited number of repair packs
Indy can hold a maximum of three
When you return after each voyage pick up some more you will need them
Don't forget to shoot in the air or the wolf will bite you
Go further until you see the elevator and waterfalls
Elevator is your way back point
The river is a strange one it has one beginning and several endings
Each time I didn't care where I go I didn t even try to remember the way or somehow navigate in the currents but at the end I always was at the exact location where I needed to be according to the plot of the game the next candle
The first candle is in the trunk of the huge tree behind it you will find Treasure gold coins
The second candle was in the light tower along with a spider
The third one is inside the building standing on the water
The door upstairs is locked but you can break the window and pull the lever to open it
Only in order to get the fourth candle I had to navigate the river in my own way at first I turned left then there was a lighthouse with a dead spider and after it I took a right current and finally I turned towards the bridge on the right and got ashore
Climb the ledge and take Treasure gold coins
Cross the bridge you can see three pistons in the room
Your goal is to get to the left side of the far wall's second plane
You have to jump over the pistons in the following sequence jump on the rightmost piston jump back to the near wall's second floor run through the barrels and cross the small gap jump on the leftmost piston from the platform jump on the middle piston and then to the far wall's second floor side
Now gather Treasure a silver bar in the niche above the fourth step use your whip to climb the candle Treasure a golden idol and a medikit near barrels and return to the boat
All river's currents finally meet at one place near the elevator
Take Treasure a blue gem pull the lever step inside the cabin and you will get to the surface
When you gather all candles or one by one put them into the slots of a candleholder and light them Indy will cross the bridge enter the sanctuary and the level will end Level Shambala Sanctuary This level itself is a huge puzzle
It's quite a tricky one
The four different buildings contain levers and mechanisms which you will have to push and activate
And at the end of the level you will meet the Ice Guardian terrible creature a walking piece of ice
After defeating it you will get the first piece of the Infernal Machine the Urgon's part
Climb up the ledges and get to the roof of the building
Cross the bridge and enter the sanctuary
Shoot in the air to keep away the wolf
You can't open the main building's gate but you can get on top of the low roof nearby to the left and then climb up the left building's brick wall
The wall's climb path is itself a maze which will lead you up to the roof
However before that you can pick up Treasure a gold bar located below the far end of the low roof
On the roof jump into the hole you're inside an ancient multi storey clock tower
Your goal at this time is to activate the clock's mechanism
Until then none of the levers will work
Use the ladder to the left and the ledges to get down to the ground carefully
In the corners of the tower you will find A ladder to get back on top of the building a sealed gate you'll need Holy Woman's key a hole in the floor
Jump in that hole you will see a strange icy creature stuck on the ceiling it will run away
Those creatures are quite harmful when you face several at once feel free to use your gun
Run through the room with some mechanisms and you will see a larger room with a river down below
Use the slopes on the right wall to get down and kill the three icy creatures
Move the block at the far wall towards the river and the water power will activate the mechanisms
Now start climbing the middle ledge and use your whip to get on top
From that place jump on the lower moving platform
In front of you there is a stone ledge with a skeleton get health plant there
From the moving platform you can also reach Treasure a blue gem on a ledge between the lamp and the right wall from here
Return to the platform and jump to the next wooden ledge

From there you can finally reach previous room
Explore the mechanisms and pull the block near the wall towards center the clock will be activated
Return to the clock tower and run to a door
Press a button in the wall to open it there's no bridge but you can pick Treasure a green gem if you hang and drop outside
Return to the floor and start climbing the tower up to the gong figure
On your way up press both levers in the wall and a button
The lower lever activates the gong figure you will have to push it again later the upper lever opens the gate on the roof and allows to move across the bridge
The button will draw bridges between small wooden platforms in the opposite walls and you will be able to pick Treasure a red gem in the niche
Now run through the opened gate inside the forth building multi storey bell tower
You will see a huge bell down below
Your current goal is to pull it up and to activate the gong figure so that it will hit the bell causing the Holy Woman appearance
Until that moment the lever to the left is useless
Another lever which pulls up the bell is on the topmost floor of the tower above your head
To get there you'll have to travel down first and push another lever which unlocks all ladders in the tower
But Indy can't just jump down it's deadly so move back to the bridge and notice a window in the tower's wall below it
Break it and enter the bell tower's floor
Kill icy thing from above through a hole in the floor and jump down to the next ground plane
Continue till you find the lever and push it
Now all ladders are unlocked climb up the topmost tower plane and push another lever there it will pull the bell up
Pick up Treasure a gold bar down below where the bell was
Return to the clock tower and make your way to the lowest lever which you will press for the second time now
It will activate the figure so that it will hit the bell and a Holy Woman will appear
She will give you a key from the sealed gate at the bottom of the clock tower
Run there and unlock the gate
Your current goal is to find and raise a flower which will unlock Holy Woman's power when you bring it to her
You are in the main building now with a statue and a waterfall
Run through the passage to the right of the entrance it leads inside the small building in the yard
Kill the icy thing inside
Explore the house and find some medikits Treasure gold coins Treasure a gold bar in the walkway above the bed and the Great Monastic Seal on the second floor
Russians will rush into the monastery
You can easily kill them from the second floor's window with a rifle
Anyway you won't need to walk out in the yard
Return to the main building with a waterfall
On your way kill the three guards and rotate the statue counter clockwise two times
This will open the gate down in the pedestal
Before jumping inside the hole notice a niche with Treasure a silver idol it's a trap
Take it and jump back immediately or the floor will collapse
Now jump inside the previous hole and kill a spider in the dark tunnel it will appear here each time you will use the tunnel
Crawl the deadly floor a giant hammer and kill two icy creatures in the next room
You will see an elevator here
Before stepping inside the cabin notice a corridor inside the opposite wall use your whip to get there
At the end of the corridor you will see another Treasure a golden idol trap
Smash the idol with your whip it will fall down from it's place and trigger the trap while you're in a safe distance
Collect the prize and return to the lift
Unlock the sealed door high above with the Great Monastic Seal
You are inside a room filled with water
You can see a lot of wood beams and girders
On the opposite wall behind the gate there is a plant you need
To unlock the gate you also need the key jump across the right side girders and blocks to the niche in the right wall some of the blocks will crack down and break up
Collect the key inside the niche and return to the room
Now you will have to jump all over the top blocks in the walls to reach the balcony with the plant
Not that fast
At first jump clockwise till the first corner girders then hang and drop down
Now use your whip and jump across all the low level girders in the counter clockwise direction till the opposite corner nearest to the balcony
Climb on the two last girders
From this point you should be able to finally reach the balcony but something's missing you can find it inside a wall
It is a block
Pull it take Treasure a silver bar and climb on top of it
Now you can reach the balcony and get the flower
As soon as russians appear jump into the water
The current goes right to the waterfall but you can also get out from the water by climbing the middle wooden block on your way
Now hang down and collect some treasure
Hang again and drop down you will find yourself again in the elevator room
Time to raise the flower make your way to the main building with a statue and a waterfall
Above your head you can see a large transverse girder
Climb on it from the statue's pedestal and jump across the gap to the platform on the right of the main gate
Hit the button it will move up the ladder on the opposite platform
Jump back to the central girder and to the ladder platform
Climb up to the top floor
You will see a locked door and a golden grate
You must get inside this locked room
When Indy first steps towards the golden grate window a cut scene appears in which you are advised to use a window to get inside the room
Shoot through the golden grate and smash the right window
Now run around the nearby library room till you reach another window in the far side
Kill the icy creature shoot the window and kill a guard on the opposite roof
Now shimmy to the right and pull up in the first broken window area
Only if the window is already broken Indy will be able to pull himself up
Enter the room and place the plant inside the golden chandelier it will start moving down and finally reach the water current on the floor
Run downstairs and jump on the central girder
From this place you can clearly see closed blinds above the main gate
You can jump to the platform beneath it and the blinds will open when Indy steps onto it
Use your whip to wrap around a chandelier's log above and you're finally there
Light will rush into the dark hall and rise the flower
Jump down and make your way to the Holy Woman to give her the flower
On your way you will have to deal with guards in the clock tower
The Holy Woman will become a beautiful young lady and open the portal door for you
Make your way to the icy world of the Ice Guardian below
Downstairs you will face a strange monster made completely of Ice
It can climb walls and the ceiling it is very clever and always runs after you wherever you go
Before showing your nose out of some doorway be sure the beast is not directly above your head
Whoouhhh
By the way you can't kill it for a while
Are you already afraid
The Icy dungeon consists of buildings with no roofs
It means that the beast can easily nail you from the ceiling if you're inside any of them for more than half a second
Be sure to remember that
Upon your arrival you will face the creature immediately make a quick right jump Z RightArrow to the nearest doorway
The best tactics against the monster is to remain INSIDE the doorway more closer to the outer side than to the inner part of the building
If Indy is in that position the Guardian can't target him even from the ceiling it gives you time to think what to do next
On the second floor roof level you can see some passages and bridges connecting the buildings
Your current goal is to climb up the building's roof run along all the bridges passages and use your whip to reach the room at the very top of the cave
There you will get the Urgon's part the first Infernal Machine Piece
That thing is very useful against the monster if used properly
At first find a room with a white slope inside
Run up the slope and pull the block out of the wall now the passage on the other side of the block is free
Run to the building in the opposite corner and climb the ledges inside
Don't pay attention to the monster it will always be after you
Be faster
Run along the passage all planks will fall to the floor and jump across the broken bridge section now the pushed block is out of your way
Continue until you reach a room with a statue below
Climb up the icy ledges in the right wall to get on top of the roof
Use your whip to jump across the chasm and get to the destination room
Inside take a piece of the Infernal Machine and slide down the slope
To kill the monster you must blind it times with a flash that produces the Infernal Piece Select it in the Inventory or press Q and then press fire Ctrl
Normally you wait for the beast to climb down run as much close to its face as possible and flash the Weapon right into its face When stunned it stands on two legs
Quickly press Z DownArrow and run away from the monster
If you need health pick up two health leaves on the tables inside some of the buildings
Caution The Urgon's part is rechargeable
Be sure it is fully charged before use or it will harm Indy too
When the monster is dead find a piece of ice next to the wall which covers the exit from the dungeon
Use the Urgon's part on it for the last time and the level will end Level Palawan Lagoon The weather in the lagoon is very bright but the sea is full of quite dangerous surprises
At this level you will meet sharks and some other deadly fish
The goal is to find an entrance to the aborigines' city
Indy will have to travel vast distances in the sea so better buy more medipacks than ever
The best tactics against sharks is to keep swimming almost touching the bottom of the sea
You can fight the fish with your Machete but it will cost you a lot of time and health
Crabs are friendly
You are on the sea shore
Turn around and walk back inside the narrow passage until you reach the deadly pit
Use your whip to cross the pit
Explore the remains of the skeleton and find Machete and a medipack
Take Treasure silver coins behind a crate near the skeleton
Go back to the sea shore and to the right
Follow the passage and break the web covering entrance to the cave with your Machete key to activate
Kill the iguana and run to the place where it first showed up
You will find another cave nearby covered with some green leaves

Walk a bit more along the passage and you will see some white ground near the plant Indy will say there's something here
Dig it with the spade and pick Treasure a silver idol
Run till the end of the passage and pick a health leaf behind the rock
Return to the beach through the cave where you killed a spider
On your way find a cracked wall inside the cave use your Urgon's part to smash it and pick Treasure a blue gem
Swim to the far shore and get out of the water Alt
If you have machete in your hand then you won't be able to do it
Kill Iguana on the shore and take Treasure gold coins behind a stone
Run to the cave's entrance and make your way through the web with machete
Kill spiders
On the opposite side you will see a sunken ship
Notice a torpedo behind the rock on the shore
It needs a detonator
Swim towards the back side of the ship and pull up on the deck
If you swim around the ship you will see a large opening in the ship's stern
Inside there's Treasure a gold bar and nothing more
Explore the deck you will find a crane pick up a torpedo detonator in the box nearby and notice that all doors are shut
On the second deck there's a lock which needs a key
Your current goal is to get inside the ship and to find the missing part for the crane
Then you will be able to turn the crane and get to the nearby island with your whip Return to the torpedo and arm it it will blow up a large crack in the ships side
Swim inside the ship and pick Treasure piece of gold in the bottom
Now grab some air and save
All the ship's compartments are filled with water and you won't be able to find a place to breathe
Each compartment is empty not to mention the deadly fish just don't pay attention to it you won't have the time to deal with it swim through
Deep Inside the head of the ship you will find a box with the key to the locked door on the second deck

Use the rusty hammer to break the lock and open the hatch then grab some fresh air
Now you're ready to swim further and get the key you will have enough time to return to the opened hatch to breathe
You're on the deck
Unlock the sealed door on the second deck and get inside the ship's cabin
Take a handle for the crane on the left wall and collect some prizes Treasure gold coins and medipack down the hole
Return the same way
Now run to the crane and use a handle to rotate it
With your whip jump across the water to the shore
Dig the white ground and step on the button a secret grotto will be revealed not far from the place where you started the level
But the door to that grotto is still locked
Your goal now is to unlock that door
At this point the map becomes crazy it shows two different cross marks
When I move to one of them another one starts blinking
By the way if you swim to the far left from the place where the level started you finally meet a strong current and notice an underwater cave near the rock
You can pick another Treasure a golden idol deep down there if you are enough lucky to avoid the sharks
Swim to the crashed airplane and use your rusty hammer to detach a piece of its propeller
Now swim to the grotto door and unlock it with the new item
Inside beware of the shark and press the button on the right wall deep underwater it will open a hatch in the grotto's roof
You will be able to swim through and reach the water surface to grab some fresh air
Inside the grotto you can also find Treasure a silver bar

The door is opened with a button in the small room above to the left
There are several ways to get there for example to climb one of the ladders
But when you press that button the room gets all filled with lava
So to be able to cross it afterwards you have to move both of the blocks on the two sides of the lava current into colored squares on the floor
Now go for the button and then jump across lava using the two pre positioned boxes and a central platform
Hey don't forget to claim some treasure in the far niche in this side's wall

Move in and make some scorpions feel the taste of a bullet
You will find a lava room with the gate at the far side which opens only for a short time with a button on the left wall
You can cross the pit using your whip but you still won't catch up with the door
Still do it jump to the far side and climb the wall on your left there's a crack

Start moving in the clockwise direction
The first couple of stone platforms don't move but after the central one you'll have to jump through the three unstable platforms to the nearest shore on the left
It seems to be easy but in fact it's quite a difficult task to do
There's no time for any additional movements while you're on the platform it sinks immediately
The usual tactics should be the following between the platforms always jump normally running jumps will make you dead fast to move to the edge of each next platform make a step on the run I mean don't use the shift key to walk just use it to turn quickly
On the shore take a close look at the left wall A ha

Look down shoot the spider and go through the doorway
Shoot another spider and grab Treasure a silver bar
You will soon see a bridge
Activate a stone monster to the right guarding those Medicinal Herbs and pick them up while the monster is busy chasing you
Jump across the broken section of the bridge and down to the small island in the lava
Cross it to the left and collect Treasure gold coins
Another stone monster will be activated
Climb the ladder and use both Tikki Keys to open the large gate in front of you it leads to the Lava Monster
Torches will come to life along all your way to the shore
Collect Treasure silver coins on the floor
You will see a large lava lake and a monster inside
He's very quick and can appear in any spot of the lava lake immediately no matter how far it was from his previous location
If you won't be fast enough he'll burn you down
Your goal is to collect the second Inferno Machine's item Taklit's part
This will make you invisible and help you to cross the bridge to the other side which is guarded by the Lava Monster
Until then you'll have to be very quick
Go for it
Use some platforms in the lava lake to get to the central one with the bridge
Forget about the bridge for a while and continue jumping along the platforms clockwise
Pick up Treasure a silver idol on a standalone platform and continue towards the shore
Two stone monsters will be activated and the Lava monster will still be chasing you
Run along the lava current and pick up the Machine's part at the end
The monster will rise in front of you

When the monster shows up use your Taklit's part pres E and then Ctrl and become invisible
Get across the bridge to the other side and follow the lava current
Another stone monster will be activated behind you jump across the lava and enter the cave
Watch out your steps the floor has some spike traps
Outside you will see that lake I told you before
Push a button on the wall and the water will rush into lava lake and freeze it along with the monster
Return to the cave and head for the level's exit it's safe to step on lava surface now Level Jeep Trek This is one of the shortest and easiest levels in the game
It is also one of the most pleasant ones reminding the Demo level a lot
You'll have to drive a cool jeep during all the level
All the controls are intuitive
Press Shift when you want to drive fast jump across the bridges
Press Ctrl from the driver's seat side to get in get off the jeep
So that's what an American dream is you can leave the vehicle only if you want to pick up some treasures lying on the ground
Explore the dark caves on your way usually you will find some treasure inside
You can run over all the guards in the level without even leaving the jeep
Aim your rifle at the ledge above and kill those russian soldiers wanting your leather jacket so badly
Pick up a medikit and Treasure gold coins in the tent and get in the jeep
Drive up the hill and cross the bridge
In the cave get off to pick up Treasure gold coins
To jump across the bridge in the next area use Shift
Behind the mountain passage go up the hill to the left get off and kill those Russians below near the broken bridge
Take Treasure gold coins
You can't jump across the bridge use the hill you're standing on to do it
Drive through the next cave and knock a guard under the palm tree
Save and continue towards the bridge with three russians and a damaged truck
You can kill them all without leaving the jeep
Just drive at normal speed and never drive backwards this makes the jeep an easy target for quick russians
Pick up Treasure a cash box then repair the bridge with a piece of wood which you can find round the corner
Now you will be able to jump across to the other side
Take the right road first and kill those russians on your way
In the right wall of the dead end you will find a small passage
Crawl inside and claim Treasure a silver idol
Return pick up a health leaf under a palm tree and get back into the jeep
Now go backwards and to the left road
The cave reminds a multi storey underground garage with a spiral road between the floors
Hold down the Shift key and move along the spiral to the level below
Keep the jeep close to the walls and you will stay alive
Get off and find a cracky wall in the dark part of the cave
It is near the cave's exit
Use your Urgon's part and claim another Treasure a golden idol inside
Go up the high hill and drive over the guard on the top
Soon you will enter a maze with some russian guards inside they have machine guns
It's easy to knock them down but beware of the truck with a gunman on your left
It will chase you along the maze path
Take a road to the right and move on
At the waterfalls take a left
The passage you should take next is clearly shown on the game's map each time if you turn hints on
For the complete map and a way through the maze consult my level's ultimate map
You can pick some treasures near the waterfalls Treasure gold coins building Treasure gold coins the crashed plane Treasure gold coins and the pillbox Treasure gold coins all guarded
At the end of the maze kill those guards and go up the last hill
Sophia Hapgood will pick you up on her helicopter and the jeep will unfortunately sink
Bye Bye jeepy
You were so cool
This will end the level Indy flies to pyramids Level Teotihuacan You will find yourself in the ancient multi storey pyramid
The goal of this level is to put up a mirror in the hands of the central statue
When all the upper floors are enlightened it will reflect the light and open a massive door to the next level
Indy is inside a spacious rectangular hall
Turn left and pick up a medikit in the small alcove
Now open the door on the right and run down the corridor
You will have to walk your way through some traps and kill a couple of scorpions and spiders to get to the Gear Room
Take the Fish Key inside the niche in the wall and immediately roll to the right the floor will start moving away revealing a trap
Kill a scorpion down there jump inside the hole and kill another one
Pick up Treasure silver coins and continue along the corridor until the door shuts in front of you
Retrace your steps back a while another door will shut blocking your way
Turn around a niche in the wall is now open
Kill the spider collect Treasure gold coins and press a button this will open both of the doors again
Now finish your way through the corridor and enter the Gear Room
I will explain the mechanism of the gears later
Let's go for the statue right now
If you take a closer look at the hole in the floor you will notice a small passage with a spider web just below under the ceiling of the room down there
That's the only way to climb down to the statue room
Pull push the gear towards the nearest door if it blocks your way
Now hang and drop inside the passage
Collect Treasure a red gem at the end hang and jump down to the room
You're in the lowest level of the pyramid with an ancient statue of goddess
You must elevate the statue to the Gear Room now
Pull three columns inside the walls and position them exactly on the illuminated pieces of floor
The statue will rise and a door will be opened on the second floor of the room opposite the gate
Climb one of the pillars you just pushed and get there
The idol at the end of the corridor is a trap
Step on the floor platform and roll back immediately
This platform is also a deadly lift
Now grab Treasure a golden idol and step on the lift to get to the upper corridor
Claim Treasure a red gem and open the door you're finally in the Gear Room again
On the second floor you can see two levers
The left one turns the statue the right one rotates the gears
The room has doors in the walls
To open each door you must position three of the gears on one line between the door and the statue
Now if you pull the lever that turns the statue the door will open because of the gear interaction
The distance between the gears and the statue may change
In the inner circle they are rotated clockwise in the outer counterclockwise
If the gear is located near one of the doors it will not change its position during rotation
Indy can move all the gears manually only along the radius
To open any door perform the following actions
Manually push one gear towards the chosen door this gear will not change position from now on
Rotate the statue till you get at least one gear on both radiuses of the doors nearby on the left and on the right side of the chosen one forget about the opposite door across the room and the fourth gear
In other words you should have at least one gear in the line connecting the left nearby door with the statue
Same goes for the door on the right
Manually push one of the gears of these doors to a different circle radius for example if the gear on the left door's line is in the inner circle relative to the statue then move the right door's gear to the outer circle of the statue
Now rotate the gears both the gears you manipulated will soon be aligned with the very first gear near the chosen door due to the fact that gears in both circles are rotated simultaneously and in different directions
Rotate the statue the door will open
Your goal is to open all of the four doors in any sequence
Three of them Fish door Bird door and Jaguar door lead to the corresponding idols Fish Idol Bird Idol Jaguar Idol and the fourth door with three heads picture contains niches with emplacements for the idols
Fish door also leads to the Mirror
You ask How the hell you know that picture on the door is a Jaguar it doesn't look like much
Simple it's written on the idol when you find it
After you've got all the idols open the fourth door and place them in the corresponding niches the statue will be lowered to the room below again
Open the Fish Door now
Swim through piranhas to the idol inside the right wall and open the underwater gate with the Fish Key you picked earlier in the corridor
Swim through the opened gate and push an underwater button behind the column
This button elevates the column
Get out of the water climb up the ladder and jump inside the tunnel above using the elevated column
Shimmy left in the stone tower to the nearest platform
Your goal is to climb up the tower using its walls ladders platforms and your whip once
Pick up Treasure a silver bar behind an idol in the alcove
Finally you will have to climb up a ladder to get to the corridor high above
It leads to the first room of the level
Pick up the Fish Idol and light will rush into the room
Take a Mirror in the niche inside the wall to the left Treasure a red crystal in the right wall and kill all those Russians from above using your rifle
Now return to the Gear Room
You can do it in two ways jump into the water down below from the top of the stone tower and go through the Fish door or use the corridor with traps which you already know
However in the corridor a heavy armed guard is waiting
I used my Taklit's part to become invisible and ran past him
Then I killed him
Inside the Gear Room kill two more patrolling guards
Now open the Bird door
You will come across another stone tower with a water pit
Jump into the water and follow the tunnel to get Treasure a silver idol the shaft towards the top on your half way
Make your way back and run up the corridor don t step on floor traps and kill all those spiders and scorpions
At the end of the corridor behind the third trap pick up Treasure a blue gem
Move backwards a little and blow up that brick wall with your Urgon's part
Inside the room you will find a ladder climb it
You will get almost to the top of the stone tower
Jump climb the ledges and ladders to reach the corridor above and pick up Treasure a green gem on a ledge on your way
Kill spiders on both sides of the entrance and proceed further
Kill some scorpions in another corridor pick up poison kit and press a button a door will open revealing the Bird room
Claim the Bird Idol and the room will become heavily illuminated
Return to the tower and jump into the water down below
Enter the Gear Room again
Open the Jaguar door
Kill a spider and don't step on the floor traps by the way you can roll over them
As soon as you enter the room a guard will rush towards you
Kill him along with the other one at the far wall
Climb up to the top of the room kill two more guards and claim the Jaguar Idol
Now all the necessary rooms above the statue are illuminated
Make your way back to the Gear Room
Open the final door with all the three heads on it
Important after the door is opened check if the passage in the floor's hole which you already used once is free for hanging grabbing to
If not move rotate some gears before the statue is lowered you can't move the gears manually along the circles
Install all the idols in the corresponding niches the statue will move down
Follow it and kill some guards in the room below one will appear just behind you using your rifle
When everybody's finished put up a mirror in the statue's hands it will reflect a ray of light coming from above and open the door to the next level Level Olmec Valley This level features a large Olmec Valley
Several regions of the valley are connected with three bridges
To activate the bridges you must position the corresponding Olmec Stone Heads onto the proper pressure platforms
The goal of this level is to reach the pyramid at the end of the valley
You will meet a giant Snake Quetzalcoatl inside there
After you defeat it you will get the third Infernal Machine's part Azerim's part which allows you to levitate above the ground when interacting with blue crystal of a strange nature
Get down to the valley using the passage in the right wall
Cut through some green vines kill the snake and shoot a couple of times to scary off the leopard
You will meet more leopards later on
They often attack from behind you can't kill them
Run along the stream till you see a lake Notice the three massive pressure plates on your way
While you stand on any of them a corresponding bridge above is activated
However you can't stand on the plate forever you'll need to find some replacement
Dive into the lake and pick up Treasure gold coins in the underwater cave
Get back to the first pressure plate and cut through the vines into the cave in the wall
Avoid the leopard and look for a crack in the left wall
Use your Urgon's part to smash it and claim Treasure a silver idol
Move up the stairs note that from this location you can also reach the first bridge and use your whip to jump across the room
Push a block and Indy will fall into a dark tunnel
Trigger the first Olmec Stone Head by stepping on the pressure plate in the floor and run to the nearest alcove down below
The Stone Head will roll down the tunnel and land near the first bridge's pressure plate
Pick up a Treasure gold coins above the tunnel and get down to the valley to push the Stone Head onto the pressure plate and activate the bridge
Make your way back to the cave and get across the bridge
The second bridge is close to you behind the vines across the ledge but it's not activated
Get down and pick up some Treasure gold coins in the dark room at the far wall
Go outside through the doorway and enter another one below
Kill some snakes and press a button inside the pool it will open the door to the next area
Kill more snakes and find a block behind the pillar
Push it inside the wall times
You will see another tunnel with the second Olmec Head above
Trigger the Head and run outside the tunnel or you'll be trapped Hop down immediately when Indy automatically grabs the ledge
Now push the second Olmec Stone Head towards the opening in the wall and it will fall down to the valley near the second bridge's pressure platform
Get down there and position the Stone Head to activate the second bridge
Russians will rush into the valley
Make all your way back to the activated second bridge and kill some russians on your way
I know what you're already thinking of When the third bridge is activated I will probably have to make ALL THIS WAY AGAIN another time
Gush it's so annoying
Relax you won't have to return to the valley again
The third Olmec Head lands into position more accurately and activates corresponding bridge by itself
Cross the second bridge and use your whip to get across the chasm
When you land russians will start shooting from your back run for your life
In the next area you'll have to shimmy over a wall and jump across the chasm to the other side but before that get down to the floor kill a snake and collect some treasures in the dark cave behind you and on your way behind the fallen pillar Treasure gold coins
You will see a room with a waterfall
Inside the pool there lies the third Olmec Stone Head
Your goal is to make the stream push it outside to the valley
Dive into the pool and climb atop the waterfall using the passage and ledges behind it
Push the button on top of the waterfall it will drain the area
Get down and push the Olmec Stone Head towards the opening in the wall until it stucks there
Now push another block near the waterfall
You'll notice a climbable wall
Get on top of the waterfall and push the button again the water will push the Olmec Stone Head out to the valley and trigger the third bridge
Continue to the next room climb up the ladder and cross the bridge
On your way kill some snakes and collect Treasure gold coins from a cave lying down below to the left of the pillar
In the next area you'll have to use your whip to get across but before that pick up a health leaf below on your left
You will soon get inside the cave with an Eagle Headed Stone
Your goal is to get to the top of the pillar bridge outside
From there you can push its top edge and it will fall turning into a bridge across the chasm for you
Note the door above the ledges to the left behind the Snake statue
There's a button which opens this door for a short time you will have to climb there fast
Behind the door you will find the pillar edge you need to get to
Kill all the snakes below and claim Treasure gold coins in the small room with a fire
Now press the button on the building's wall and leave the cave
Press another button outside and rush to the door I already mentioned
On the left side of the platform just before the door look for Treasure gold coins and rush through the doorway
Push the huge pillar's edge
Get back to the cave Cross the pillar bridge and run into the next area

You will find a health leaf near the basement of the pyramid's stairs
Climb up and pick Treasure a golden idol
You will find yourself inside the Snake cave
Remember your current position
Behind the large doors in front of you there's a Snake Lair along with the Azerim's part
Behind the other doors on your back there's a small room with a pressure plate in the floor
To kill the Giant Snake you will have to use four spikes in the room's floor
Each of them is triggered when Indy steps onto corresponding pressure platform in the corners of the second floor's catwalk
To get to the catwalk you'll have to use Azerim's part and levitate upwards Position yourself under any blue crystal and activate Azerim's part then use cursor keys to go up down and Alt key to leave the power current
All four times you should step on different platforms and activate different spikes otherwise you won't hit the Snake
Start from the spike which is located behind you to the left then the one which is in front of you and to the right after it behind you to the right and finally the one in front of you and to the left
Giant Snake can't damage you when you're levitating or on the catwalk but it can throw small snakes up there you'll have to kill them
When you're on the room's floor run quickly and avoid any snakes don't have time to deal with them
Just try to get back to the catwalk as soon as possible
Hang from the platform and drop to the floor
Open the gate behind you and step on the pressure plate inside To open the gates you'll have to light the torches with your lighter on the both sides
Run to the opposite door and release the Snake
You'll have to sneak past the Snake and get the Azerim's part first
Then try to kill it
When the Snake is dead a passage reveals on top of the room above the first gate you opened
Levitate up there using the Azerim's part under a crystal in the ceiling and finish the level
Volodnikov somehow manages to entrap Indy and grab all his possessions Level V I Pudovkin This is one of the shortest levels in the game
It features large multi deck ship full of Russians and treasures
All the action takes place on board of the ship
You start the level with empty inventory with no weapons and no machine parts imprisoned in one of the ship's cabins
Your goal is to find all your stuff repossess all the machine parts and leave the ship
You will find the treasures guarded by russian soldiers almost in every cabin
While playing use your Taklit's part to become invisible and investigate new rooms with guards remaining undetected
Then you can think of the best strategy of fighting them
Note that Taklit's part can harm your health too if not switched off in time
Try knocking at the door a guard appears leaving no hope of escape for you
Climb atop the bed and open a ventilation hatch in the ceiling The guy on the wall is famous Comrade Lenin
Later you will find some other Soviet attributes on this level red flags and Comrade Stalin portraits
Now knock at the door again and quickly climb inside the ventilation system It doesn't lead to anywhere
The guard seems to be astonished with Indy's sudden disappearance
Quickly hop to the floor run through the door and lock the guy inside
Now you will have some time before he manages to escape
In the corridor you will notice some doors
Only first two on the left are important
Behind the first one push the lever it will attract soldier's attention
Retreat to the corridor and enter the guard's room from outside
Claim Taklit's part
Continue to the large ship's cargo hold with goods and containers
Use your Taklit's part to become invisible and sneak past the guard in the center
Pick up all your stuff in the ship's nose compartment

The next door has a ladder which leads to Captain's Bridge
Watch the cut scene and grab the Azerim's part in the darkness
Now get back to the Crane Hold
Move the crane a couple of times and lift up the box with a blue crystal
Now you can levitate to the upper deck use Alt to leave the power current but before that check the area behind the truck and get Treasure cash box
Kill the guards and open any of the doors
Behind you will find a couple of russian tough guys
I used a grenade to kill them
You don't even have to get close to them
Far below pick up the Treasure silver coins and press the lever it will lower the ladder to the top deck
Climb that ladder
There's another tough russian soldier behind it I opened the door threw the grenade and shut the door again to eliminate him
When he's finished take the crank wheel which is required to lower the boat

After the final battle grab the is Treasure silver coins on the ship's nose return to the back and use Crack Wheel to activate the mechanism lowering the boat
Indy leaves the ship and level ends Level Meroe
This level features ancient pyramids of Nubian kings
Inside each pyramid there is a Lens Room
You must turn on all four lenses to open the door to the next level
The light beams from the lenses will show you the exact locations of the one eyed statues which require an eye crystal to open each of the four hand type locks on the exit door
There are several places in this level which trigger the appearance of Russians
By not pressing some buttons you can postpone the Russian threat to a much later time
Anyway there are few of them just people including a machine gunner and some grenade throwers
You will also meet some hyenas on this level
You can't kill them with any usual weapon
Use your jeep to run them down
Near the first pyramid there's a dark opening in the wall
An aborigine boy is hiding there frightened of the hyenas
Talk to the boy and kill all the hyenas around you will need his help later
Next time you enter the opening the boy will be gone
Go around the pyramid and notice a small storage house behind it

There's something inside you want to get
As soon as you approach the edge a boy will come
Give him your watch and he will bring the eye crystal from the tunnel for you
Return to the storage house near the first pyramid
Climb the pyramid's wall it's a maze and jump in the opening from above
Inside the pyramid kill some spiders and use your Urgon's part to smash a wall down there
It will also push a moveable block outside

In this pyramid you'll have to do several things the sequence doesn't matter attach the Bucket to some strange device in the pool area
It will start grabbing water from the pool and initiate a small water current which will rush outside the pyramid
This will fill the empty pit with water outside the pyramid
You will need this water pit later it reflects the th pyramid's beam and shows the correct position of the last one eyed statue
turn on the lens in the pyramid's Lens Room
Just set on fire a piece of wood located in the center of that room
A colored beam of light will appear and show a spot on the desert's floor with the first one eyed statue
Find a way to the next pyramid
You can walk in two main directions the sequence doesn t matter
Left passage leads to the pool area right one to the Lens Room and to the corridor connecting this pyramid with others
The Lens Room in each pyramid is usually located somewhere close to the top remember that when you look for a path ladder
You can also leave some marks on the walls of the maze with your chalk to help yourself not to get lost but generally you won't need to do that
Go to the pool and attach the bucket
Now return to the pyramid and go for the Lens Room
Here I skip some obvious actions

Use your whip to climb up and jump on the platform
Inside the Lens Room place the piece of wood on the block and light it
The final th beam will spot some place in the desert where one eyed statue is hidden
To exit the pyramid turn right when leaving the room and use the Urgon's part to smash a wall
This will finally trigger the appearance of some Russians
It is not difficult to shot them from above here
Get down on the ground and kill the rest of them
Now find the four spots in the desert shown by the beams
Each time you step on the correct spot however move away your jeep a statue appears

Find an old mine cart which needs a wheel and some fuel and finish the level
Level King Sol's Mines
You start this level riding a mine cart
Go for a ride around several railroad sections separated with gates
When you're in the cart they open on your approach however you can't just turn where you want it depends on the position of the railway switches
You can change the position of all the switches in the Switch House by pulling corresponding levers
The goal of this level is to gather King Sol's Gems Eye of Horus and install them in the Pyramid
During your quest you will need to switch to different roads
Watch out for the low pipes they can hurt you if you don't duck quickly press C
Grenades turn to be very useful against outnumbered snakes
Find the Switch House in the first large chamber
Check out the map inside
This map is very schematic and gives you only a slight idea of where to look for the switches
After a couple of hours of searching for every switch I decided to draw more specific map for your convenience check out this level's ultimate map now everything's easy
In the Switch House you will find a medikit also take a look at the picture of young Indy
Behind the map there's an empty fuse box which requires a fuse to provide electric power for the levers
Note that the th switch is stuck you will need some oil later
On the roof of the Switch House you can read a strange message left for you by some of those crazy game programmers
Drive your mine cart to the next chamber Railway station and pick up the fuse in another railroad cart
In the corner behind the boxes you will find Treasure blue crystal
Explore the two corridors nearby
The left one leads to a dead end with a TNT box
When you blow that TNT it will reveal Treasure an idol
The right tunnel leads to the pyramid
Get back here at the end of the level
Return to the mine cart and proceed the road loops back to the Switch House
Install the fuse and pull the levels
The sequence is not important
Besides switching to another railway loop they trigger some actions with Russians
After you push the first lever Russians take positions in all main chambers of the level
The Switch House the Railway Station and some other rooms become heavily guarded and another mine cart with guards appear on the road in front of you as soon as you board yours
The second lever seems to be just a switch it doesn't trigger any action with soviets
If you push the third lever and then ride past the switch it triggers a cut scene of a bazooka explosion and mine cart jump
And if you push the th lever you'll need to oil switch to do that the mine cart with soldiers will finally explode in the dead end
After this cut scene Indy wisely pulls the th lever too to switch back from the dead end you won't be able to pull this lever later the only way to the th lever road segment is on foot
Keep chasing the russian mine cart until you see a cut scene of dynamite explosion
Get out of the cart and kill the remaining guards watch out for the electric cable it hurts
Pick up the key in the blown up area
This key opens the locker in the Locker Room next to the Railway Station
You will find some oil there
Take a ride to switch and use the oil on it
Find Treasure a blue gem behind the pillar
Get back to the Switch House kill all the guards there's also one inside and push the th lever it works now

Several times I even managed to get face to face with that guy but he behaved as if I was a brick wall and disappeared quickly
Notice moveable blocks on both sides of the room and block the middle passage
Pull one of the blocks inside the passage and to the central crossing square
This will prevent Volodnikov from using this way for a shortcut as he did before
It is also possible to close one of the entrances of the passage with another block but it seems that you won't need that
Now start chasing Volodnikov you will soon see him entering the upper floor of the central building

Pull the lever and both Sophia and Indy will be dropped to the next level Level Aetherium This level is something completely different from the usual Indy like style
You're inside some multi dimensional substance which allows you to access different places from the levels you've already been to in reality through special portals
To activate a portal you'll need a Tool from Beyond
You can pick up some treasures and health items in those small reality incarnations along with the King Sol's gems required to finish the level
Anyway you won't be able to imagine stuff like that in your wildest dreams
Aetherium looks very strange but you'll get used to it quickly
The main idea is that all the locations of this level are connected through other dimensional power tubes currents
You are safe and free to choose any direction while you are inside such current
To leave the current use Alt as usual
You will also meet Marduk's two incarnations on this level
And of course you will have to win the final battle to finish the level
Leave the current and land to a ledge below
You're near the lower levels of the Aetherium atop some cubic structure connected throughout with those tube tunnels
To enter the current hang and drop to it it is safer then jumping through it
You can fly anywhere you want but generally follow the map and you won't get lost
Note that you can enter the core of the multidimensional cube from several sides
Each time you will find yourself in different tunnel leading to some location in reality
But first enter the green tunnel look at the game's hint map which leads to a blue room with the Tool From Beyond

Proceed to the next portal and enter the room
Shoot the strange creatures and explore the surroundings
You can see poor Sophia in a distance
Approach the opening in the center of the arena
If you look down you will see the blue room where you found the Tool from Beyond
To get to the Monkey Island Easter egg do a running jump into the opening in the center of the room
You should land in the Aetherium
Swim to the end of the tunnel with the orange or brown stripe
At the end you can turn toward a portal and go to Palawan Island or go through the new portal opposite the Palawan one to the Monkey Island
Go through the Monkey Island portal
Look at the pictures on the walls and get Treasure a golden idol from the table
Find a tunnel which leads to the top of the Aetherium
Instead of going straight through the small patch of Aetherium into the big room swim up towards the top
There are several exits but you'll need the one through which you can see a gem on the floor
Go through the entrance and collect Treasure Aetherium gem
Now follow the tunnel to its top and leave the current in the room with Marduk
You can't beat him with your usual weapons there must be another slightly different way
In fact there is find Teotihuacan portal and take the mirror from the goddess statue
Armed with the mirror you would be able to reflect Marduk's electric blasts and finally kill his reincarnation
Blue tunnels around the arena lead to its bottom level
Go there kill some monsters and find the pink corridor which leads to the portal
Pick Treasure a silver bar near the walkway and a mirror from the statue
Exit the portal turn left and follow the corridor to the end
Blast the floating creatures and find Treasure an Aetherium gem in a small alcove
You're back in the Marduk's room

Marduk can float slightly or high above the ground
In each case you should find an appropriate position on the corresponding arena level
Run upstairs along the green ramp or downstairs after each direct hit
You'll need to hit Marduk about times before this reincarnation dies
Take the pink gem Marduk Medallion which left Marduk and place it into a slot in the wall the electric ball will lower down
You can whip it to charge your whip with electric blasts
Whip it times and get electric whip hits
After it you will have to get back to this room and recharge
Swim down the other blue tunnel and whip the electric ball with BMW sign the door will open
Again swim along the current and enter the outer arena
You will see large gears located near the walls and floating Sophia
Watch out for Marduk's ghost floating in the center
Whip the electric balls of the inner chamber to close its inner gates it powers the gears
This will also lower down the crystal with Sophia and free her just for a moment

Don't waste your whip electric blasts trying to fight her now
Just avoid the flying monster
Around the arena on the same level you will also find three portals leading to the King Sol's crystals
Collect them all
Find a tunnel that leads down below to the floor of the arena and swim down there
You will see three doors with the slots at the bottom of the arena install all the three King Sol's Gems there and open the portal behind each door the machine will experience a severe damage
Collect the goodies inside each portal medipacks poison kits and Treasure cash box
It will also reveal a stone structure in the center of the arena and shrink Marduk Sophia
Climb the structure and fight the beast with your whip
To beat Marduk Sophia you will need a large number of medipacks
You'll have to let her get as close to you as possible before whipping with electric blast
She will need a lot of whipping trust me about or more hits
Don't waste your whip blasts unless you're absolutely sure the beast will attack you face to face
If you run out of whip blasts ascend one of the tubes and recharge the whip in the Marduk's room
Sophia is released with the death of Marduk's second reincarnation

Level In this level you will familiarize yourself with the controls
Although it rsquo s easier to avoid the guards once you rsquo re comfortable with the combat system you should be able to defend yourself easily against this level rsquo s opponents should you face them one on one
As it is often the case in the game combats against multiple opponents are far more difficult
Objective You must reach JACQUES DE LA FERRIERES on his torture table
He will give you instructions to complete your mission
Notes To complete this level you must know How to hide yourself
Face a wall press LEFT SHIFT or its joystick equivalent
While you HOLD it you can move along the wall
Once you LET GO you are no longer hidden and you must face the wall again to hide a second time
How to walk
Know that running in Inquisition makes noise and attracts the guards attention causing them to turn towards where they heard a noise
If they see you they may attack you or call for reinforcements
To walk press and hold RIGHT SHIFT in addition to the direction keys or move slightly the joystick
How to crouch
Hold Left CONTROL to crouch let go to stand
Use the whistle
Use PGUP to whistle
If a guard is within a certain range he will come towards where he heard that noise
This can be useful if a guard won rsquo t move but only if you have a way of escaping him if he did move
You start the game in a jail cell
All you have is the ability to WHISTLE
Do so Then HIDE next to the door to the right or to the left A guard will open the door and enter
If you rsquo re hidden correctly he won rsquo t see you that rsquo s when you escape
Else he will see you and hit you
You rsquo ll have to do it again You are in a corridor
Notice the rats
If you walk in the PUDDLE the rats will move away
That rsquo s because those puddles make noise even if you just walk on them Proceed to the door and open it In the next corridor a guard is approaching
You can see its green cone of vision You can either In this room you rsquo ll notice a guard behind a weapons rack
He won rsquo t move
You can either The next corridor is empty In the next room there is a guard who immediately stands up and walks towards the door
You must leave the room and go hide in the previous corridor until the guard has passed Then return to the room and avoid his colleague In the next corridor pay attention to the prison cells
If you walk in the puddle you will make noise and the prisoner will start to shout
Then a guard will come
Although the latter is easily avoided do yourself a favour and try to stay clear of the puddles In the next room there is one guard sitting and two sleeping
If the sitting guard sees you he will try to wake his friends up which you don rsquo t want to happen
Avoid his vision and the puddles as you leave this room In the next long corridor you will notice a guard approaching in your direction You can hide behind any of the pillars
At the end of the corridor as you approach the door an FMV will start
When it finishes you rsquo ll see a guard leaving the room by this very door
Go hide yourself behind a pillar
You can finally enter this room and talk to Jacques
Jacques will tell you of a MEDALLION which is very important to this adventure that you must give to one of his friends whose address is kept in the ARCHIVES level
Leave this room
Level Objective Find the medallion and the address then escape
Constraint To find the medallion you need the LANTERN
So get the LANTERN first
at the stairs go up Pick up the LANTERN You may then choose to continue on this level get the address and get the medallion later
It is actually faster to go for the medallion now so we will explore this course of action Go down the stairs twice Enter the first room carefully
As long as you stay in the door frame you are safe Observe the guard rsquo s behaviour and when you feel you can safely go walk towards the right of the room ie do not cross it to the door opposite of you
Once you are reasonably far from the guard you may run but it rsquo s safer to walk all the way Follow the corridor to the next room Enter the room
Again as long as you stay in the door frame you are safe
To survive this room it is necessary that you WALK and never never run or make any noise First avoid the two drinking guards when you feel it is safe to pass Then go behind the barrels and pick up the key
Again do not make noise
There rsquo s a sleeping guard over there and it rsquo s unlikely you can defeat guards with your fists alone When you have the key go back quietly
You may hide in the little corner behind the wall of barrels to get a better view Take the corridor to the first room You must now reach the other exit
The safest way to do so is to go back towards the stairs and get behind the guard
Then walk along the left wall when he rsquo s not looking and crouch behind the furniture
While crouching advance towards the exit and go when the guard is not looking Follow this corridor and open the door A guard is torturing a prisoner
The room is covered with blood
If you walk on it you will make noise
You must walk while the prisoner is screaming it goes in cycles and stop when the guard is pausing this guard is stronger than others in this level
Take the small corridor to the next door
Use the key in your inventory to unlock the door
Then select the LANTERN because the room you are about to enter is very dark hellip Enter the room and be careful avoid the pits
Exit the room
In this next room avoid the guard by crouching behind the barrels
Then sneak past him
This corridor will prove a bit trickier than the previous puzzles Notice the first jail cell immediately to your left
Enter it
Feels familiar
You are in the same situation than in the very beginning of the game and the solution is similar
Whistle to attract the guard then HIDE towards the front of the cell so that the guard won rsquo t see you
Then exit the cell quickly and move towards the end of the corridor you can rsquo t lock the guard in this time
In this room the guard is easily avoided
Go towards the cell in the opposite corner
In the cell you will find the medallion
You can also find some rocks
Take everything use the lantern if the cell is too dark
As you exit the cell you will find that the guard in the previous room has changed position
He won rsquo t budge and will be difficult to pass
Use the rocks to attract him to another place in the room so you can pass safely
Aim so that he doesn rsquo t see you on his way to the where you threw the rock
The long corridor has also a cell immediately to your right where you can play the same trick than on your way in
A prisoner will talk to you and suggest that you should look for the toilets to escape the jail
Return towards the stairs
The other guards can be passed in a similar way than on your way in and should pose no difficulty
On the stairs go up twice
You are now where you found the lantern
Proceed to the next room
Avoid the monk rsquo s detection field
If a monk sees you in this level he won rsquo t attack you rather he will send a guard to kill you
Note you can rsquo t attack monks
Proceed to the next room
It is very dark so you may use your LANTERN and light the torches that are on the walls
To pass this room you must move the crates that block the exit
Push and pull them you may jump on top of some of them if you want
Crouch through the hole to reach the next room
HIDE immediately along the bookshelf
Avoid the guard by staying as close to the bookshelf as possible and hiding on the other side too
When you have safely cleared the guard go towards the wall next to the door and hide behind the furniture
Enter the next room and avoid the monk
In this room proceed to the next while avoiding the predictable monk
In this corridor you must hide you can do so behind the furniture or behind the pillar
In any case once the guard walks behind you you should walk past him and go to the right then open the door to the next room
The next room has several monks looking for books in tall bookcases in it
You can either The next room has one sole monk in it
Go to the exit opposite from you
You will enter the records room
Avoid the guards get the minutes from Jacques rsquo s trial then go back to the previous room
You may read the minutes from your inventory
Go to the second exit in this room hellip enter the short corridor
Open the door you will enter the toilets and escape the prison
Level General comments Woohoo
In this level you will find your first weapon the dagger
While it rsquo s not much more damaging than bare fists it rsquo s very quick and allows you to parry which does make a big difference in a fight
Then again guards are notably stronger here than in the prison
In this level you will be introduced to most of the thieving skills Stealing Picking locks Knocking off people with the club
Please check the instruction manual if you have problems for any of these actions
Level Short term objective cross this street section
Mid term objective go bring the medallion to Olivier in exchange for money
you automatically pick up the daggers
Good you may pick up stones around the well back to your initial position go towards the right and avoid the guard
There are plenty of ways to do it the safest would be to HIDE against a wall on the left hand side of the screen
Using the whistle or rocks works also fine Open the door
Note that if you are detected this door will be closed until you kill the guard The CRIPPLE will warn you that the GRAND COHER leader of the gang of the court of miracles is impatient to see you
You must hurry hellip In this street section there is another guard to avoid
Hide against the pillars on the left hand side of the street to pass him The next guard will not move and should be passed with a rock The last guard is standing behind barrels
You can see his cone of vision intersecting with those barrels if you crouch
The idea is to hide behind one of these barrels and hop between barrels when it is safe above all be patient and you will pass this section with ease Open the last door and pass to the next level
Level Short term objective cross this street section
Mid term objective reach the court of miracles
you will start this level in a large square with a pyre
Four soldiers are patrolling you want to avoid them all because else the four of them will attack you and it is likely you will die Sneak behind the guard closer to you
WALK slowly towards the wall and above all be sure to avoid the PUDDLE of rain on the floor
HIDE against the corner of the wall furthest away from the start of the level and wait for the second guard rsquo s corner of vision to appear
Then it will go away
THEN AND ONLY THEN leave your hideout walk then run then walk towards the THIRD guard
If your timing is right you can walk behind him with ease and exit the square without ever worrying about the fourth guard This can sound quite tricky but if you observe the guards movements it is in fact straightforward
Still there are alternative solutions First you could slaughter the guard closest to you right away but do it quick so he won rsquo t alert his friends
Then it will be very easy to clear this passage Or you may want to use a rock you may have kept from the previous level which could ease things considerably After you rsquo ve passed this square you will find yourself in a street where two green green from Malandrin rsquo s gang bad guys cutthroats will attack you
They are easily defeated Eventually you will reach a smaller square where you will avoid guards
It is easier than the first square so keep this in mind Avoid the puddles of wine DO NOT run Crouch behind the wine barrels at your advantage Reach the exit and enter the court of miracles Level Short term objective get COHER to teach you some thief tricks Mid term objective find Olivier and your reward
you have now reached the court of miracles
First go talk to the GREAT COHER on his throne your first assignment is to STEAL from a person
Approach him silently walk from behind use your robbing blade and you should be OK Then return to Coher use your inventory select the PURSE and give it to him Coher will now ask you to rob a cutthroat doing his rounds
Proceed
Be careful ndash if you make too much noise before you try again you rsquo ll have to go outside of his field of vision first Give the second stolen purse to Coher
Follow him to the next level
Level Short term objective get COHER to teach you some thief tricks Mid term objective find Olivier and your reward
listen to Coher rsquo s speech and pick up the lock pick
unlock the door
unlock the chest and pick up what rsquo s inside the caltrops
unlock the door and enter the room kill the cutthroat using either your dagger or the newly found caltrops Listen to Coher speech
Mind the part about ldquo a share of each loot rdquo hellip Level Short term objective leave the court of miracles Mid term objective find Olivier and get your reward
To leave the court of miracle you will have to find coins to pay the cutthroat who is guarding the exit
coins can be found on a table
Their owners will probably attack you if you take them hellip coins can be found in a chest next to Coher rsquo s throne that you will have to unlock
coins can be robbed from a cutthroat
Level Short term objective find the house of Olivier Mid term objective find Olivier and get your reward Level Short term objective escape the house of Olivier Mid term objective retrieve the medallion Long term objective find the treasure of the templars
After the movie you understand that Olivier has been taken to the Tribunal and that soldiers guard the entrance to the house
You must escape
open the door closer to you Pick the ham on the table and proceed to the next door You are in Olivier rsquo s bedroom
Move the bed to reveal a trapdoor
Open the trapdoor and take what is inside a horse statue Use the statue inventory in front of the chimney on the empty pedestal
A secret passage will appear Crouch inside
It is very dark in there
Use your lantern to move around
Avoid the traps
At the end of the corridor unlock the door
Since it is very dark you may want to light the torches along the way
Move the crate out of the way
Enter the secret room
You will pick up Olivier rsquo s journal
Read it from the inventory hellip So the medallion is the key to the Templar rsquo s treasure
You must retrieve it
Of course Coher must never know of this
Optional in this room some gold coins are hidden
Find them if you like Move the crate towards the hole and climb jump on it to exit this level hellip Level Short term objective escape the tavern of the thieves Mid term objective retrieve the medallion Long term objective find the treasure of the templars
As you thought you were safe you are captured by Malandrin and taken prisoner in their tavern
You don rsquo t have any weapons move the barrels to exit this room avoid the two thieves and reach the stairs upstairs BY ALL MEANS do not run walk patiently and avoid making noises
Walk quietly towards a trapdoor which contains your stuff and a club
Then a RTC will run guards will enter this room and walk downstairs
A thief is now guarding the exit move quietly towards that thief and club him down unlock the door and escape the tavern
Level Level objective retrieve the templars Medallion
General comments In this level you will find your second weapon the sword and you should be familiar with the game controls
Difficulty will pick up
You begin this level in the court of miracles
You try to explain Coher that you never found Olivier rsquo s house but he doesn rsquo t believe you and you are taken prisoner
Level Short term objective escape the cave
Mid term objective find Olivier You are in a small crowded environment from which you must escape without being seen by the two guards
Try crouching and observing
Being a prisoner you have no weapon and you will perform poorly in a fight
There are multiple solutions to this puzzle
If cornered try to use rocks which litter the place to your advantage
Level Short term objective leave the court of miracles Mid term objective rescue Olivier You have escaped the cell
First you must reclaim your equipment
It is in your bag which is on Coher rsquo s throne To leave the court of Miracles go talk to the goon next to the door
He won rsquo t let you pass unless you bring him wine
There are THREE KEGS of wine in this level which you can retrieve in any order One keg is behind the throne of Coher
WALK and avoid the puddles or you will wake Coher up and he will summon his cutthroats One keg is in a chest on the far end of the level One keg is on a table but a thief is watching over it
WALK behind him and silently knock him off using your club then retrieve the keg Give the three kegs to the door keeper he will pass out You can now exit the level
Matthew will automatically pick up the sword a much more powerful weapon than your daggers
You can now safely fight thieves and cutthroats and defend yourself adequately against one or two guards Level Short term objective enter the tribunal where Olivier is held captive Around the corner you will shortly see a green vision cone hellip Be careful
You may want to use ldquo projected view rdquo while you hide to decide when is the best time to make your move
You can hide behind the crate if you crouch or behind the pillar on the left hand side It rsquo s not overly dangerous to fight this one but expect a few bruises though The next guards will be difficult to pass without a big fight
If you rsquo ve saved ham and bread why not
But you will probably be hurt badly
It rsquo s safer to go in the little street to the left You will be ambushed by three Malandrin thieves
You should have no problem with your sword
On your way back be sure to pick up the bread As you leave the alley you will notice that one of the guards has moved
Use your club to knock him off You can now pass safely the other guard in the little square
Proceed until you see a RTC with a patrol of four guards approaching
One of the guards from before will come from the other side
Tough hellip There are many ways to overcome this
The quickest is to hide in the wall directly opposite from when you came there is a little tiny deadspot that will let you pass the man patrol
Then you can process to the next guards Else you should go deeper within the street and find a good place to hide as there are many
The various guards will stop at various parts of the street
Do not go at the very end or else you rsquo ll have to fight your way back
But whenever you feel it rsquo s safe to go go up the street and avoid the guards one by one Now see the big building over there
It rsquo s the tribunal
Unfortunately you can rsquo t enter it from the front door
You rsquo ll have to avoid the guards pretty much by staying away and go towards the scaffolding
You rsquo ll have to position the crate so you can jump on the whole thing
Level Short term objective rescue Olivier The first room you enter is full of monks
Now you can rsquo t kill monks
But you certainly can club them
Just walk quietly behind them and use the club
It rsquo s fun
You can avoid them altogether it rsquo s just safer to treat them before you go Pick the door with your lock Use your lantern to see in this room
Mind the debris on the floor which will hurt you
Jump over them
Light torches if necessary
Pick the door with your lock
You will enter automatically in the next room where a RTC will take place
When it rsquo s your turn run for cover behind the furniture as a guard leaves the room
Once he rsquo s left you are safe and pick your time to go to the next room
Find a way to progress towards the guard in front of the door without being seen by the patrolling guard and club the former
Use the table to your advantage You can move up towards the table and by staying on the opposite side of your opponent remain hidden you must of course be crouching Open the door Take the stairs Open the door Two guards will attack you automatically note I personally feel that this gameplay is idiotic and will make sure it won rsquo t be in the final version so those two guards are killed with just one hit
In this fight you must dispatch them quickly and avoid moving from your original position or you will be detected by other enemies
You are now in a ring like structure there are cells in the inner circle which you can use to hide from the patrolling guards
If need be you can knock them off with your club
You can find some bread in the cells too
On the outer wall you will find a wooden door you can open
It leads to a torture chamber where a guard is questioning Olivier
Rescue him you can knock off the guard or just attack him A movie will launch
Olivier dies you find yourself in the possession of the medallion once again and have a new clue another templar called Pierre d rsquo Aumont who resides in an abbey that rsquo s your destination for level
Level Level objective find out about Pierre d rsquo Aumont and the templar rsquo s treasure
General comments In this level you will have no weapons
There will be no fighting whatsoever and there will be no enemies to avoid
It rsquo s a good old fashioned adventure game
Level Short term objective enter the crypt talk to the monk and follow him to Brother Anselme Talk to brother Anselme

A FMV will start somebody is trying to kill you
But the monk Arminius will save you
You will wake up in his room Return to the room that leads to the crypt and go down the stairs hellip Level Just explore the crypt check out the altar and go back to the abbey
Level Short term objective open the secret passage in the crypt go talk to Arminius
He is in the copying room which is on the opposite corner of the cloister He will mention four elemental stones that you must gather The water stone is in the fountain in the cloister The fire stone is hidden on the ridge above the chimney in the kitchen Arminius has the air stone
But first you must ask to another monk who will tell you to leave him be
Then go ask Arminius about the stone he will give it to you Once you have these three stones talk again to Arminius he will mention a document about the stones which is nearby
Pick it up
Return to the crypt In the crypt look around the broken column for the earth stone Near the altar put the stones in their appropriate places using the document you found at the copying room
The altar will move revealing a secret passage Level Short term objective reach the Baphomet In these two levels you must explore the underground passageways and avoid their dangers namely pits and cave ins

She will ask you for her standard fee
Go rob some rich fool then return to Marciole She will tell you where to go where there was a guard you could knock off and will offer hellip more Cross the square take a right then a right leave the area
Level An annoying rogue wants money to allow you to pass

Pick up the crossbow Kill the guards from a distance with the crossbow
You could defeat them also if you manage to separate them and fight them one on one The Alchemist will give you his mask in thanks

Level The first part of this level will just introduce you to the poetry of the plague Proceed to where a man is hanged move the crates crawl through the passage

Be careful he looks behind all of a sudden now and again
Better hide against the wall behind him and wait for your time You now see the convent
There are three guards in front
The one with no helmet walks back and forth to the dark alley on your left
Follow him quietly and club him
That leaves only sentinels in front of the convent
But you can rsquo t enter by this door
So you rsquo ll have to continue to your right
The remaining guards are easily avoided by staying far enough from them
The lone guard in that corner is watching over a chest
You could fight him or distract him and open the chest to get some arrows it rsquo s worth it IMO
The next gameplay involves two guards watching towards the street in a desynchronised fashion
Wait for the right time to pass
The final gameplay also involves two guards patrolling in that street
Avoid them both to reach the door on the left side of the street
The trick is that you rsquo ll have to pick it so time is of the essence

In level
At the beginning of level you will find a barricade to the left hand side bash it down with the axe to reach level Explore level until you find a room with a Baphomet statue
But beware
It rsquo s not the one you rsquo re after
So never mind the letter on this one it rsquo s a false clue See the barricade in this room
Bash it down
Below is the true Baphomet
You now have the three letters that make the Baphomet true name Make your way back to level then
Avoid Fight dark templars along the way Level Short term objective solve the riddle of the templars as you enter the room you will see a templar at the opposite side

If you activated another tile walking on it again will de activate it Now the templars are defeated and you find yourself in the Labyrinth hellip Level Level Level Short term objective survive and find the treasure of the templars General comments There are no enemies in the labyrinth
It rsquo s no picnic though Here is a brief list of the hazards you may encounter Pits if you fall you die Crumbling tiles if you stay on the ominous grey tiles for too long they fall apart and you too
If you manage to run to safety they make your way back more difficult because you have to jump longer
Spikes they come in two fashions
Some are visible and hurt you if you walk into them
Some are spring traps that are triggered if you walk on a tile with holes
The spikes will spring out and hurt you severely Plague clouds Arrow traps
Skull statues will occasionally shoot arrows at you especially after the traditional ldquo clic rdquo sound
