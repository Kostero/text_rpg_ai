Lands of Lore III Quick Guide by David 'LordFebo' Tomsic Game Start
Proceed north into the cave picking up the knapsack knife and journal along the way

Use the knife to cut through the spider web and defeat the spider lurking on other side

Continue north past the spider web
Early Morning
From the front door of Gladstone Keep proceed to one of the guilds
The Cleric Guild is to the West the Mage Guild is to the East and the Fighter Guild is just North of the Mage Guild

To join Thieves Guild just continue walking past the Fighter Guild and down the steps
Enter the sewers of Gladstone through the small gate in the wall at the bottom of the stairs

To gain full membership to a guild you must complete their initiation quest
Collect a pork chop from a dead pig to complete the Cleric quest
Kill all the rats at the docks in the Gladstone Woods to complete the Fighter quest
Collect a sample of a portal in Gladstone Woods with a gem which is given to you by Sioned a Mage Guild member to complete Mage quest
Just finding the Thieves Guild is good enough for full membership with them
The Journey Begins
Once you have joined a guild you should now find the Draracle
Enter the portal in the Gladstone Woods by the small volcano
This leads to Volcania
The Draracle will be found there

After finding the Draracle you must now find the Sigil
This portal will take you directly to the Draracle's Lair where the Sigil is hidden

When you arrive at the Draracle's Lair you will encounter Jakel and his puppet of the Draracle
After talking to Jakel and his puppet the real Draracle will open the door leading to the Sigil
This door is the southern one in the chamber with the puppet of the Draracle

Once you have found the Sigil you must now find the five shards from the broken mirror in the Draracle's Lair
These five shards are scattered in five portal worlds

Proceed to one of the two revealed portals in Gladstone Woods
One leads to Volcania and the other leads to the Frozen Wastes
I prefer to collect the missing shard in the Frozen Wastes before the one in Volcania
Please note that it doesn't matter what order you enter the portals in
The Frozen Wastes
Once you enter the Frozen Wastes proceed directly to the White Tower

At the White Tower you will encounter Jacinda
She has the shard that you need
You may either kill her the first time you meet her and collect the key which opens the door to the vault that holds the shard or kill her after killing all the starks at which point she has the shard on her

If you elect to kill her immediately the quickest solution you will find the vault that holds the shard in Jacinda's throne room

If you decide to help her and the barbarian women first by killing all the Starks in the White Tower you will find Jacinda waiting for you in her throne room once you have completed this task

After collecting the shard you will be transported back to the Draracle's Lair

After you talk to Jakel proceed through the old caves to return to the Gladstone Woods
Go directly to the portal leading to Volcania
Volcania
You must defeat Morphera the queen of the dragons to gain the shard found in this realm

You may encounter Morphera up to three times
It isn't until the last encounter at the lava lake that you'll actually be able to defeat her and gain the shard

To defeat Morphera at the lava lake you must first plug up the three lava flows into the lake
If you do not do this she will resurrect herself each time you kill her

Once you kill Morphera the shard will reveal itself
Collect the shard with the Sigil and you are once again transported back to the Draracle's Lair

Proceed out of the Draracle's Lair and Caves after talking to Jakel and enter one of the two new portals that have appeared in the Gladstone Woods
In this example I will take you through the Underworld before the Ruloi Homeworld
It doesn't matter what order you enter the two portals in
The Underworld
To gain the shard in the underworld you must defeat the Scythe Demon who has made the shard a part of itself

To gain access to the attic where the Scythe Demon resides you must first wind the clock in the ballroom

To get the clock key you must aid the ghost of a burn victum
First find a glass cup for holding lamp oil then find the ghost of the burn victum
She will tell you her tale
You must break her curse
To do this use the glass cup to drain the oil from the lamp in a room near where you find the ghost of the burn victum
You must empty the lamp before the lamp breaks and sets the room on fire

If the lamp does break before you can drain the oil then let the fire kill you and you will be resurrected automatically to try again
This cycle of events will continue until you successfully empty the lamp

Once the lamp has been drained the ghost will reveal the key you need to wind the clock
Use the key to wind the clock in the ballroom until the clock breaks
This will cause an organist to appear
You must now get the organist to play music which will in turn cause the ghost dancers to dance

To get the organist to play you need two things sheet music and a bottle of wine
The sheet music is found down the hallway to the West of the front door of the house
The wine is down some stairs in the kitchen off the hallway to the East

Once you have these two items click the sheet music on the organist then the wine and then the sheet music again
The organist will now play and the dancers begin to dance

The dancers will reveal the stairway that leads up to the attic

To defeat the Sycthe Demon in the attic you must first wind the attic clock to the point that it breaks and then kill the demon
This will reveal the shard

Once you are transported back to the Draracle's Lair proceed to the portal leading to the Ruloi Homeworld after talking to Jakel
The Ruloi Homeworld
The key to winning this level is finding the Ruloi hand
This hand will open a hidden telepad that leads to the Ruloi Hive Mother

To gain the hand just continue killing Ruloi Warriors the yellow Ruloi until the hand appears
To ease your task destroy all the regeneration pads
This will keep a Ruloi from regenerating after you have defeated one

Another tip be sure to have either a spell or item that protects you from poison i e
the stone bracers
This will aid you greatly in navigating the numerous pools of acid found on the homeworld

Once you defeat the Ruloi Hive Mother the shard will be revealed
Collect the shard and you will once again be returned to the Draracle's Lair
You have one last shard to collect

After you talk to Jakel proceed to the last and final portal the Shattered Desert
The Shattered Desert
You must defeat the evil quot wizard quot in the cave to gain the last and final shard

Make sure you have a range weapon and protection from poison before entering this realm
The range weapon is needed to defeat the evil quot wizard quot
The poison protection keeps you from getting radiation sickness
If don't have a range weapon don't panic there is one to be found in the caves of the evil quot wizard quot

Proceed through the canyons until you reach the cave
You will need to jump to a platform climb some vines and a long ladder to get to the cave entrance

Once inside the cave you will need to navigate yourself through duct work find a robot eye to open a door destroy and stack computer monitors smash panels to bring down a force field and destroy quot hot quot wires to keep yourself from being electricuted as you cross through water

Once you gain entrance into the quot wizard's quot throne room you must destroy it's force field generators before you can destroy the quot wizard quot itself

Once you destroy the quot wizard quot the shard will be revealed to you
Unfortunately this time you will not be returned to the Draracle's Lair
You must instead escape back through the cave before the quot wizard's quot self destruct timer goes off
The Final Battle
Once you have escaped from the quot wizard's quot cave and returned to the Gladstone Woods proceed immediately to the Draracle's Lair to confront Jakel
You have collected all the parts of the mirror now you must seal it
Jakel has the Seal and guards it jealously

After your initial encounter with Jakel he will teleport you into a pool of water
To escape just turn degrees around and climb up the rope
Do not be tempted to go up the ladder

After climbing the rope you must now defeat the spectres of Jakel
Defeating them will open doors that will eventually lead to a room with a hanging bridge
Before you can cross the bridge needs to be lowered by turning a wheel

Once you cross the bridge you will enter into the final chamber
Here you will attack and defeat several monstorous Skeletal Guardians before Jakel reveals himself

You must defeat Jakel to gain the Seal which will be used to close the portals
The Big Finish
Once you have defeated Jakel and gained the Seal from him you are done
Use the Seal to seal the mirror which in turns closes all the portals and restores the lands of Gladstone Back toGameBoomersHome PageBack toGameBoomersCheats Hints and Walkthroughs

Find African statue on shelves to right of door
Use it twice to open desk cupboard
Yet another hacking puzzle to learn about missing retro virus CD in Mexico
OK now you're on your own It would take at least moves to detail the solution to this puzzle
What you need to do is head for the centre of the grid and just keep increasing the weight of each node to hit space while sitting on a node and choose that option
When you feel comfortable about evading the anti viruses head over towards the objective to the top left of the grid
Then when you have nearly the entire grid lit up with nodes of weight that are under your control go to the objective at the top centre of the grid and then make your way home Joy announces she has mined the monastery so save and prepare for a fight
Tip Deal with the baddies with the crossbows first
As you exit the Monastery there's another fight
Use the same strategy
Cut scene takes you back to Mexico
MexicoCheck to see what Simon gave you bleeper grapnel and cable pliers and crowbar
You have to work with these objects so find the 'active' part of the electrified fence
In inventory use pliers on grapnel twice to get thin steel cable and then detours
Use detours on fence then cut with pliers
Crawl through
After small cut scene keep crawling keeping the low wall between you and the guards
You can get right up to the wall in front of them
When you are close enough to interact with the guard on the left press the bleeper and watch them disappear
Climb fire escape and use lever to open door
Enter
Inside take acid from first table and sleeping pills from next
Approach the door that leads to Lab to learn you need to press two buttons at either end of the room simultaneously to unlock it
Next go into Vivarium and take spool of wire from shelf then return
Now for the buttons
Climb steps near second button and note smoke detector
Tie wire to it
Next attach grapnel to wire
Use spool of wire again to attach grapnel to nearby shelves
Then use acid on it
Watch cut scene to see the fruits of your labour
Go to Lab and head for the door to the vault
Use crowbar on the locking mechanism
Solve latch puzzle and enter vault
Examine shelves and Salma will arrive and tell you what number DVD you need
After this cut scene you'll have another fight
As usual take out the crossbow baddies first
Back to NY New YorkTalk to Candy and then pop up to the Boardroom for a chat with Sullivan and a report on your last 'deal'
Talk again then back to your office to view the DVD in your computer
In cut scene Salma will offer to analyse the DVD further and Candy will alert you to a secure email in the computer room
Go there to get message then off to Sharon's Sharon's ApartmentKnock three times then enter
OH NO a trap
You pass out and wake to find Sharon murdered and you're holding the murder weapon
You must get out of here
Take Tuxedo from wardrobe hairpin from table and scissors from bathroom
Try to leave the door is locked but the key is on the other side
Look in the mirror you'd better get changed so put on the Tuxedo
Use scissors on folding screen to get piece of cardboard
Slip it under the door then use hairpin to get the key
Unlock door and leave bedroom
In the living room you can't miss the fish tank
Remember Sharon keeps her spare keys in with the poisonous fish
You'll need something to get them out so pick up the ruler from the table and glue from the desk near the laptop
Exit to the kitchen area and take the fork from the bench top
Back to the fish tank
In inventory put glue on the ruler then attach the fork to it
Now get the keys
Oh No
Doesn't work
Perhaps the bourbon from the kitchen table will do the trick
Go get it and pour it into the fish tank
Now you can get the keys and leave
Once out in the corridor the only escape is via the window
You'll make a quick phone call as you approach it then out you go
SarjevaneAfter chatting with your friends it's time for another hacking puzzle to learn who sent the bogus email from Sharon
This one only has a single solution so we'll go through it step by step
Move onto grid a
Move right b
Move right c
Move up c
Move right d
Move down d
Move right e
Move up e
Move right f
Move up f
Move right g
Move up g
Move right h
Move down h
Move up h can't move onto objective or we would be trapped there when anti vurus comes out
Move left g and keep adding weight until it becomes a ' node'
Move down g and turn it into a node
Move down g and turn it into a node
Move down g and turn it into a node
Move left e and turn it into a node
Move up e and turn it into a node
Move up e and turn it into a node
Now we have the anti virus comitted to following us and it will peter out right where we want it to at node g
Move right f
Move up f
Move right g
Move up g this is where the anti virus will exhaust itself
Move right h
Move down h
Move down to objective find out who sent e mail
Move up h
Move up h and skip turns until ant virus is gone
Wow only move to spare
Move left g and go back the way you originally came to make your exit Jenny Lucas sent the e mail
Read her personal file and note she was born overseas
Find Joy outside and talk to her she'll tell you to chase up more about Jenny's origins
Next talk to Simon and he'll tell you to contact Kerensky who will wait for it prime you for another hacking puzzle this time you must hack the FBI it's the last but not the trickiest
All you need do is take control of the nodes in the centre of the grid
Keep adding weight to them until the are all nodes
Then start moving over to the left
When you've built up all the nodes around the objectives move onto them making sure you are not in immediate danger
Once both objectives have been visited make your escape along the bottom of the grid
When finished hacking read the files
So Jenny Lucas is Helena Deckovar
Go and tell Joy and Simon then next go to Salma in the underwater cave
Cut scene reveals the humanitarian milk shipment to Drinavia is contaminated
You've got to stop it
Talk to Kerensky he can't help
Back out to Joy too late the baddies Nightshift have arrived you have to deal with them one by one
Exit by back door and take Salma's necklace from the top of the steps
Return and take the fireplace exit to puzzle room with trapped stone
Place the necklace behind the trap then go and break the Ming vase to attract attention
Watch greedy guard grab the necklace One down three to go Exit through gate in puzzle room and continue on to find next the Nightshift behind an iron gate
Take electric cable and turn off power to the sparking box
Use cable on box to rig trap
Two down two to go
Exit through the newly opened gate and turn the statue to neutralise the next Nightshift
One to go
Return through fireplace and outside
Take steps down to next level but instead of continuing down to the courtyard walk behind the steps and find the bell ropes
Save
Use the ropes and the way is clear well almost
Salma has been kidnapped and taken on the freighter
You must follow but not without another fight
FreighterTake grapnel and cable
Talk to Joy then make your way forward
Open metal cabinet on wall locked
Use the grapnel to open it and take electrical wire
Sneak up to second metal ring and tie wire to it to make a trip
Ring the bell down more to go
Continue and note water faucet before heading down
Next reconnect the plug then follow the lead literally to see where it goes
It ends at the feet of two more guards
Sneak right past them to get the bucket
Back for some water then get behind the guards again and wait for action icon to tip out the water
Turn on the electricity more down
Move ahead to see two more guards no passing them
So return to the scene of your last crime and use the ropes on the railing
You'll swing over the side of the ship and sidle along to get rid of one more guard
Simply bypass the other one by climbing the ladder
Watch cut scene where Joy gets diverted you're alone again
Inside ship Take wrench and go down steps to pick up rope
The lower door is locked so go back and enter the one above
There's a grate here and it's open
Crawl in and you'll find a small door that needs a special key
Continue searching till you find a spinning fan with the key just out of reach if you're fond of your fingers
Back out
Head off down the ramp till you find a passage blocked by steam jets
You might want to do something here
Continue down and pick up the broken hook and note the jammed grate
Try to go further your pathway is blocked so return to the spinning fan and use the broken hook to get the key
You can now open the other small door and use the valve to turn off the steam
Return to the not so steamy passage and take the oil
You can now open the jammed grate just below
Crawl in
You come across a hole with a guard standing conveniently below
Drop the wrench on him then use the rope to climb down
Look around
Take the LCD timer from the barrel
Up the stairs there's a door that needs a number code
You'll soon run into Salma and your penultimate fight
Tip use the extra weapons asap
After fight free Salma
You can't move the crate blocking her prison but Joy will arrive and give a hand
Salma has the code to unlock the nearby door so watch the cut scene and the two women will leave
Open the coded door and pick up the C explosive
Take the detonator from the ammunition case
Combine it with the timer to make the ignition
Use this with the C to make a time bomb
Put the bomb in the crate of explosives and Helena turns up
You get shut in so climb the ladder
Before long you'll meet her again for the final showdown Provided you win of course you'll save Drinavia and become a hero

Last Half of Darkness Tomb of Zojir Walkthrough by ronrob Games Notes This is an intentionally dark game
If it is too dark for your tastes you might want to raise your gamma setting a little
The game has numerous different environments and finding your way around can be a challenge
The in game map is only partly helpful
Sketching out a map as you go can be a big help
It is also wise to mark where things are that you can rsquo t do yet so you can return to them easily
The following conventions are used in this walkthrough F Forward B Back L Move Left R Move Right In special instances the directions are spelled out
You will often change orientations when you enter a new scene
For example if you enter a room through a door you might find that door now to be at the side or back of the room
This takes some getting used to
Clicking the eye icon usually results in some comment but in other instances it opens up an action
This walkthrough ignores the former and focuses on the latter

You are prompted for a web site and the one seen in the TV commercial seems likely WWW CHEMBIOSCEREAL COM Now you are asked for the first two lines from the hidden message
These must be typed exactly as they appear in the first two lines above
The password is that taped to the side of the computer mermaid
Read Hank rsquo s email
The email from Jim gives the combination to his locker
Make a note because you will need it later
Bx and Exit the back door
B and Enter Doorway to the fish house on the right
Look at the metal lockers on the right and then look closer at Hank rsquo s locker at the left end
You can see his key that broke off as alluded to in Jim rsquo s email
B and look closer at Jim rsquo s locker next to Hank rsquo s Enter the combination that Jim gave in his email
Look inside and then look inside Hank rsquo s letter
Take thekey
This might be the key to the drawer beneath Hank rsquo s computer
Bx and go to the Pier
Enter Doorway into Hank rsquo s house and go to the Computer Desk Try the key you just found on the desk drawer
Look in the drawer and take Hank rsquo spoem
Read it in inventory and see that Hank rsquo s wife rsquo s name was Amy
There are other important clues for later
This completes your work at Hank rsquo s place so use the map to go to the crypt
The Crypt Enter Doorway to the crypt and click the puzzle altar
The scroll you found back at the house told you thatthe knobs in the outer ring must be swapped with the eye tiles in the inner ring
Note Also see page of the game manual
The knobs and eyes can be moved only along the slots
To move a knob or eye click it and then click the open spot where you want it to go
Some of the outer tiles have only one slot by which to enter the inner ring so it is probably best to start with those
Successfully completing the puzzle causes a secret door to open
Enter Doorway and then Enter Doorway x at the foot of the steps
Look at the base of the statue on the right click the panel and take thecylinder with gears
B and Enter Doorway at the back You see a doorway on the right with a large hole
The cylinder you just found looks like it would fit there
However remember the blueprints you say at the basement workshop at the house
The cylinder must be fitted with a metal cap and a handle both of which you have
In inventory use the metal cap on the cylinder and then the handle
Insert the cylinder into the hole and click it to slide away the door at the back
F into the boiler room
Rotate the red wheel valve to turn on the gas inside the boiler
Use the lighter on the boiler
Enter Doorway at the right and rotate the red wheel valve near the floor
This provides power to a device you haven rsquo t seen yet
Bx and R to the way intersection
Take the Path forward and Fx
L and Fx into the tall narrow structure
Here is the device that you just powered up in the boiler room
Click it to get a better look
This is a convoluted problem and it requires materials that came with the game
First note that there are three pairs of symbols
The right symbol in each pair looks like those in the ring on your DVD disk
The left symbol in each pair is an ordinary letter as depicted in the ring on the paper insert that came with the game
Place the DVD disk on the paper insert and see that the letters and symbols can be made to match up
The question is ldquo How should the matching of letters and symbols be done rdquo Play with the two red wheels and see that they control the letters to the left not the symbols
Moreover the pair at the top right is not affected at all
Because that pair remains stationary you might suspect that it serves as a key to show the initial starting correspondence
I believe this puzzle is randomized so I will give only an example
In my case the display at the upper right wasX h Therefore place the disk so that thehon the disk matches theXon the insert
Don rsquo t let the disk move or slide
In my case the symbol in the upper left pair is a circle with a dot and an arrow pointing up
Finding that symbol on the disk I see that the corresponding letter isM
Now turn the upper wheel until M is displayed as the letter
Now look at the bottom pair
In my case the symbol is a P with a horizontal tail at the bottom
I locate that symbol on the disk and see that it corresponds toI
I turn the lower wheel until I is displayed
After both pairs have been set click the rectangular button
If the settings are correct the first green light comes on
Note too that a new key pair appears at the upper right
Repeat the process two more times to complete the puzzle
Something slides along the top of a rail and the gates to a crypt open up
Now you need to go to that crypt
One method is to click ldquo Mansion rdquo on the map and then Bx to the way intersection
Take the Path and F and Enter Doorway x to go into the crypt
Try F to find that the gate is down
Look at the top of the column on the right to see three movable stones
For some help on what to do look again at Hank rsquo s poem Behind the gate the secret lies unlocked by letters three will rise
What three letters should be set in the column
Because Hank rsquo s poem was about his wife Amy the best possibility is A M Y
The stones can be turned right or left and holding the mouse button down will turn the stones more rapidly
Turn the stones to read AMY top to bottom
After the gate rises go F to the urn
You can use Hank rsquo s poem again A drink of water to send her down


If you took the earlier hint use the bucket of water on the urn
If you didn rsquo t you will need to return to the kitchen in the house to fill the bucket
The weight of the water turns the platform into a down elevator
The Mine Lx and F Take thefuel canwith yellow markings
Up Stairs x on the right
Open Door on the left and look at the grotesque painting of Amy
There is a hole near the bottom of the painting
Use the mechanical key on it as you did before
The wall panel slides away to reveal a secret chamber
Look in the area above the generator and see a small spout
Use the fuel can to fill the generator rsquo s fuel tank
B and look at the instructions mounted on the post beneath the light
The power must be full and switch A must be off
B and go to the Control Panel
Set the left red button to and run the slider all the way to the right for full power
For the red square buttons press B and C and leave A at off
See an overhead monorail car appear
B and Exit through the dark area left of the generator
Exit through the door on the right and go Up Stairs
Enter Car and push the lever for a ride through the mine
Exit the car on the right Exit F Exit to the mine entrance
The Swamp Go F toward the left to arrive at another way intersection
You can move left right or forward from here
The fireflies can be the landmark
Fx and note that you can move right from here
Fx and Enter Doorway into the house
Look at the high shelf on the right click the pot and take theventia leaves
Enter Doorway on the left to the large room
Look at the high shelf on the right look at the Venus flytrap and take thefly Bx and look in the tall bookcase right of the bed
Open the right door and try to take the mysterious box but you change your mind
Remember that it is here though
Look at the book and read about an anti venom for the blue adder
The method is bring alcohol to a boil and then add ventia leaves and a Ctenizoidea sac
Does this suggest that a blue adder awaits you
Bx and Enter Doorway at the left into a hall
F through the yellowish door
Look at the chest on the floor and see that it is locked
Enter Doorway on the left to what looks like a storage room
Look at the top shelf near the door and see a box with a scorpion guarding a key that you surely want
The to do list is growing
B and Exit through the yellowish door
Enter Doorway on the right
Move Right through the door and F to the basement lab
Look at the shelves on the right and read the book on the left
You learn that Ctenizoidea an ingredient in the blue adder anti venom means trapdoor spider
You also learn that the trapdoor spider likes flies
You have a fly so maybe you can use it to get the spider
Look at the bottom shelf and take themaggotfrom the middle jar
Bx to the hall
F through the yellow door and Enter Doorway on the left
Look at the high shelf next to the door feed the maggot to the scorpion and take thetiny key
Open the tall cabinet on the left and take thekeyand thebottle of alcohol
B and Exit through the yellow door
Look at the chest use the bigger key and take thematch
Bx Enter Doorway on the right and B into the large room
Look at the high shelf on the left and use the tiny key on the lattice box
Yikes
It was just a matter of time
Click the box and takeHank rsquo s fishing license Turn Over License to trigger the arrival of a witch presumably the occupant of this house
She thinks Hank is probably dead by now and she found his fishing license in the swamp
She explains that there were red stones protecting the emperor rsquo s grave but they were stolen and are now scattered around
The thieves didn rsquo t realize that touching them was fatal
The emperor rsquo s mage Tamerac created the stones from vampiric spirits so removing the stones has released all these vampiric creatures you are encountering
The witch tells you that you need the bloodstone that is in a box
It will protect you from the spirits but don rsquo t open the box until the time is right
Okay but right now you have a higher priority
You were bitten by the snake and you need anti venom
The medication requires alcohol and ventia leaves which you have but you also need a Ctenizoidea sac which you now know means a trapdoor spider
B and Exit the front door
Bx and R Look at the ground just above the left tufts of grass and place the fly there
B look there again and take the spider
B and Fx to the front door
Enter Doorway and Enter Doorway on the left
Enter Doorway on the left again R and F down to the basement lab
Look at the lab apparatus and use the match to light the candle under the beaker at the right
Pour the bottle of alcohol into the beakers then add the ventia leaves and the spider
Drink Mixture
Bx to the witch rsquo s room
Look at the cabinet behind her open the right door and take thebloodstone box
Bx and Exit the front door
Bx and L for a little admonishment scene
Now you are at the way intersection
Rx to learn Hank rsquo s fate
Try to enter the boat and see that it is chained to the pier
Examine Hank rsquo s fishing license again and turn it over to see
That must be the padlock combination
Click the padlock and turn the dials to
When you hear the lock clink open hop into the boat and leave the swamp area
The Deserted City You arrive in a city with no signs of life except for a pretty lady who is watching you
Exit Boat and F through the archway
Enter Doorway on the left
Enter Doorway at the back into the main room
Look at the bookcase right of the door and take the gold coinsfrom the bowl
Read the book about the Temple of Ghostmoon
The Ghostmoon is a brilliant gem that cannot be removed from an eye socket without knowing how to unlock it
The diagram on the last page shows where the moonlight must be focused and it refers to the correct placement of a staff
You can rsquo t take this book so make some notes
B look at the drawer of the table at the center back of the room and take theflashlight
B and Go Upstairs on the left into Tara rsquo s room
She is the dark area left of the latticework
Look there to initiate a conversation with Tara
She wants to help you put the stones back in Zojir rsquo s tomb and put all this evil to rest
Tara refers to the mysterious box that you got back at the doctor rsquo s house
A ritual needs to be performed but she can be only partially helpful
You will need the scroll with the symbols on it
Now Tara passes three cards across
Turn each card over to see a symbol
This puzzle is randomized so you need to make careful drawings of the three symbols
These are the symbols on which the dead spiders are to be placed on the scroll
The fourth card shows a clockwise rotation of the spiders but Tara doesn rsquo t know about this part
She suggests that you see the witch
Bx and Back Downstairs at the right
Exit x back out into the alley
F and look at the trash bin at the right
Take the batteries and in inventory use them on the flashlight
B Enter Doorway on the left and Open Door into the witch rsquo s house
Note the crow that has perched on the floor lamp
Look at the cabinet on the right and see that the top drawer is locked
Look at the paper on top the cabinet and click it to move it away to reveal another document underneath
Note This is another item that you can rsquo t take so you need to make detailed notes
The crude drawing shows a small bearded head at the center top
His heart is below and the tail is at the bottom
The hands are outstretched
On each part there is a circle with a dot which suggests that something goes in each of those places
The poem indicates Purple head mind Red and Blue hands Green heart Yellow tail Hint from Bill If you leave the crude drawing and return several times the placement of the colors is revealed to you
Bx and Enter Doorway at the back
The room is very dark but you can hear the witch
When she says ldquo Is that a mortal I smell rdquo the power comes on and you can see her
Click the witch
She says that returning the stones is a good start but you must also destroy the eye with Tamerac rsquo s hammer
She has sent her pet to retrieve it
Recall that a crow made off with the eye early in the game
Before you can get to the tomb you must get through the Spider Temple
For that the ldquo key rdquo mysterious box must be set correctly
She asks you to fetch the bag of orbs in the next room
You won rsquo t know whether you have set the box correctly until you try it at the Spider Temple
B and look at the cabinet on the left with the green orb
Click the box left of the green orb to reveal a puzzle
This is a ldquo Match quot puzzle
Move the tiles around until you have a row or column of like objects
When you do those tiles turn gray
Sometimes you need to place tiles including gray ones to channel or herd the tiles you are trying to move to a certain place
Continue until all triplets have been complete
Then take thekey
Bx into the other room
Take theeyedropped by the crow
Look again at the cabinet on the right
Use the key to open the drawer and take thebag of orbs
B and look at the wall picture right of the floor lamp
Move forward toward the tombstone and be patient
Eventually a girl appears and she drops her doll
Go back into the picture F to the tombstone and pick up thedollat the lower right
Examine the doll in inventory and take theblue orb
Go back into the witch rsquo s room and talk with her
She presents an enlargement of the crude drawing
Move the orbs to the circles with dots according to the information summarized above
Count the number of orbs that are vibrating
I believe this is randomized
This number tells you how far to rotate clockwise on the spider diagram
Between Tara and the witch you now have the information you need to set the symbols on the mysterious box
To do this you need to refer to pages and of the game manual
You don rsquo t really need the spiders
Here are the steps for setting the first symbol
Look at the spider diagram and locate the first symbol that Tara gave to you

Now move clockwise from there N symbols where N is the number of orbs that vibrated
Where you land is the new symbol

On the mysterious box set the first symbol to the new symbol
Repeat these steps for the second and third symbols
Note Remember that you will get no feedback even if your settings are correct
You won rsquo t know until you go to the Spider Temple
Therefore you might want to save here in case you need to come back to review and make changes
B and Exit the witch rsquo s house
Bx and Enter Doorway on the left
Enter Doorway at the back At the bottom edge of the screen at the foot of the stairs is a trap door in the floor
Click Floor and then click the handle to enter the sewers
Journey to the Spider Temple You can rsquo t go anywhere because it is too dark
Use your flashlight on the red handle and click the power switch
B and see that the tunnel now has lights
F once and look inside the pipe protruding from the left
You can rsquo t take the crab but remember that it is here
Fx to stand outside the sewers
From here you can forward or right
Enter Doorway on the right to enter a cave then F to a hanging bridge
Try to go forward and see that each plank of the bridge can be lighted red
Try Move Across Bridge at the top of the screen
You get a message that planks must be selected Bx and look at the pole on the right
The pole holds a stack of red and green disks
Red suggests danger whereas green suggests safety
Furthermore there are green disks that ought to correspond to the planks that need to be selected
This I believe is another random puzzle
Number the disks from the top down and thenmake a list of the numbers associated with green disks
B and Fx to the hanging bridge
Select the planks according to your list with being the first plank in front of you
Then Move Across Bridge
Fx to the skull puzzle and click the skull
This is a lock that must be solved in order to gain access to the Spider Temple
The display looks very much like that on the torn page that you took long ago
Examine the torn page again and see the doctor rsquo s solution
Note There is a catch you get a limited number of clicks
If you exceed the limit the lock resets
Therefore as you move from one number to the next always take the shortest route either clockwise or counterclockwise
When you solve the puzzle you get aglowing jewel
Bx to the sewer entrance
This time Fx to the Spider Temple
Look at the statue and keeping your fingers crossed that you set the symbols correctly insert the mysterious box into the mouth
F through the door that has opened at the back
Then F toward the wolf
Why do evil wolves always have red eyes
Well he isn rsquo t going to allow you to pass
B and Enter Doorway on the left
Exit at the lower left and Bx to the sewer pipe
Enter Sewer and Bx
Look again inside the protruding pipe and take thecrab
Fx back to the wolf
Give the crab to the wolf and then Enter Doorway
Fx but floor spikes stop you
Look right near the bottom of the screen and take the twopieces of a staff Look up and right at the disk with a hole
Use the broken staff pole on the hole to reset the spikes
B and Fx to the foot of a flight of steps
Up Stairs to the courtyard
Zojir rsquo s Tomb Enter Doorway on the far right and see a massive door blocking your way
Enter Doorway at the back of the courtyard and F Look at the tall vase on the right and take thebomb
Then F to the weights puzzle
Note that there are no weights marked IV so you might conclude that the three unmarked weights are IV
However if you place one unmarked weight on one holder and empty all the weights on the holder next to it you see that the unmarked weight depresses its holder by only a little bit
In fact if you now place a I weight on the empty holder you can see that the I weight is actually heavier than the unmarked weight
Another possibility is that a careless stone engraver forgot to mark the unmarked weights as I and should have marked the I weights as II the II weights as III and the III weights as IV
If that is the case then adding up all the revised values of the weights gives you a total of
Because there are weight holders it seems that each should carry units of weight
Once you realize that the solution is not hard but you need to keep in mind that blank I II III and III IV
That first massive door that blocked you way is now open to the Main Courtyard as shown on the in game map
Bx to the courtyard and Enter Doorway at the left
F and see a skeleton on the left
Take thepolehe is holding In inventory put the glowing jewel into the staff top and then combine the staff top with the pole to obtain astaff
Before exploring this area let rsquo s check out the Main Courtyard
Use the map to zip to that location
R through the arch at the far right and Enter Doorway
F to the moon room and Move to Center of Floor
Recall the drawing of this arrangement
It showed that the staff had to focus the moonlight on the far left circle
For me the staff needed to be inserted in the next to last hole
Look at the area where the moonlight is focused and see bugs crawling all around
Click the eye icon again and a message appears at the top of the screen to tell you how many bugs there are
My number was but I rsquo m pretty sure this is randomized
Make a note of your number
B Exit and Bx to the Main Courtyard
Enter Doorway the yellow lit area at the back and Fx
Note the stands around the tomb for holding the stones you have heard about
Use the bomb on the candle on the floor to light the fuse
Don rsquo t worry this is not a timed sequence
Click ldquo Courtyard rdquo on the map and Enter Doorway on the left
Fx to a door with a disk and holes
On the map this is the moon door
The task here is to make the numbers inside the holes add up to the number of bugs you saw in the moonlight
Note thatall holes must be used Each hole is initially set at so you just need to adjust one or more holes
For example my total was so I changed holes to x x Back away from the disk and the moon door slides open
F into the hallway between the moon door and Tamerac rsquo s chamber
See the skeleton on the floor ahead and see that it has a red stone in its hand
Remember though that touching these red stones before you have Tamerac rsquo s charm will be fatal
B and Move Closer to the Wall
According to the map this is the way in to Tamerac rsquo s chamber but it is walled over
Place the bomb in the crack
Squeeze through Wall into Tamerac rsquo s chamber
The charm is in the upper left corner
Touch and watch its effect on the red stone you just saw
Now you haveTamerac rsquo s charm which means you can pick up the red stones
Exit at the right look again at the skeleton ahead and take thered stone
B and in inventory open the box given to you by the swamp witch
You can do this now because you have the charm
Take thered stonefrom the box
You have more red stones to find and there are areas not yet visited
Click ldquo Courtyard rdquo on the map for a fresh start and then Enter Doorway on the left
R through the opening on the right
Look at the eye door on the right
Look at the hole in the wall left of the arch
Something is needed here
L to the dungeon area and find that the gate is closed
R through the bluish opening on the right and F to a room with a ladder
Take aboardfrom the top of the ladder
In the center of the room is a small pyramid on a rock
Use the board in the hole of the pyramid to turn it and flood the room with water
Now you can Climb Up Ladder and F through the top opening
Two critters greet you
Click either one and the witch tells them to leave you alone
Fx to a ruins and find a skeleton with a red stone
Look at the skeleton and take thered stone
L through the arch and Down Stairs x
Take thestone with a hookand attach it to the C hook above to serve as a counterweight
Move the lever all the way up to raise the gate
R into the next room
Not much more can be done in this area so click ldquo Courtyard rdquo on the map again
Enter Doorway at the left again and Fx
You see a skeleton standing at the left
Look at it and try to take the ring
The skeleton collapses
Look at the fallen skeleton and take thering
Squeeze through Hole that was behind the skeleton and then Squeeze through Small Hole at the left
F and look at the pool
Go Up Stairs and click the ball puzzle straight ahead
At the upper left corner of the puzzle is a plunger
The goal is to herd the orange ball up and over to push the plunger
There is some similarity here to the Match puzzle in that you need to move tiles strategically to keep the target tile going in the direction you want it to
Generally speaking you will need tiles to move the ball upward tiles across the top and a corner tile at the upper right corner
After you start making progress in getting the ball going in the right direction you can fill in behind the ball to keep it from bouncing around so much
This is not a particularly hard puzzle but it takes some patience and strategic tile movements
When the ball hits the plunger the pool is drained
Exit at the right and look where the pool used to be
Take thered stonefrom the skeleton that was at the bottom of the pool Click ldquo Courtyard rdquo on the map for another fresh start
Enter Doorway and R The ring gets excited which might be a clue
Zoom in on the hole in the wall and use the eye ring on it to open the eye door
B and Enter Doorway on the right
Here you find three skeletons in cages
Take the red stones from these skeletons
You should now have all red stones
Click ldquo Main Courtyard rdquo on the map and Enter Doorway through the yellow lit arch
Fx and place the red stones on the pillars surrounding the tomb
A door slides open on the left and a young girl beckons you
Enter Doorway and look at the pedestal at the top of the small stairs
Take Tamerac rsquo shammer
Recall that the witch told you to destroy the eye
Place the eye in the circle and use the hammer on it
Yuck
B and see a rock create a hole in the floor
Go Down into Hole and Enter Doorway x
You come across the last door puzzle of the game
You must click squares to find a red tile remember where it is and then quickly find another to match it before the sequence runs out
You must click both red tiles to win
And you must succeed four times
When you do the door opens
Enter and look at the helmet atop the pillar
Watch the zombie creatures and then B
Then F and Enter Boat
At the end of a long boat ride Enter Chamber and Go Up Stairs
Click the handle on the big post to bring a hot air balloon down
Enter Balloon and Pull Lever
Watch the final scenes

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
Law amp Order Dead on the Money Walkthrough Len Green September lengreen hotmail com PREFACE UPDATE October Legacy Interactive have intimated that since a number of players have criticized the time restrictions imposed by the clock count down they will be issuing a patch some time fairly soon Whether this willcompletelyremove the time aspect from the game or only partially or lsquo by choice rsquo I don rsquo t know
Due to this I thought of deleting the times included here since they may or may not be irrelevant amp redundant hellip see However I decided to leave them in in case they are of any assistance If they are useless then just ignore them
UPDATE October The abovementioned patch has been released
It makes the clock count down run times slower but only if you choose the quot Efficiency Skill rdquo This should more or less totally remove the 'time' limitation
See amp below N B I haven rsquo t tried this but I assume that it works well without disturbing anything else in the gameplay
I have been informed that you will not be able to use any previous saves after you install the patch as happens with some games but not with others
This patch also corrects at least one of the technical bugs which some players have encountered
During beta testing there were some difficulties necessitating the replacement of the part CD This caused ALL previous Saves to be unusable To prevent the testers from wasting a LOT of time amp causing them superfluous repetitive hassle a basic no frills walkthrough for part only was issued together with the replacement CD
This walkthrough is based to a considerable degree but not entirely upon the one produced by ldquo Legacy Interactive rdquo hellip and hence my thanks amp acknowledgement to them
This walkthrough describes theabsolute minimumactions I think which you must take in order to succeed
However please don rsquo t use this walkthroughUNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO Many items actions and even some lsquo secondary rsquo locations which are not absolutely essential have been omitted A lot of these are interesting and provide the background story to the game
ldquo WARNING rdquo The main purpose of this game is to examine clues interview witnesses amp suspects etc Some of these actions are essential but many are fruitless or even red herrings hellip as in real life investigations If you simply take this walkthrough in your hand and follow exactly what to do amp not to do you can probably finish the game in about a couple of hours This would completely destroy the whole purpose of the game
The object of thefirst partof L amp O is for you to assist the detective Lennie Briscoe to arrest the correct suspect during working days of hours each Most actions that you perform amp questions that you ask but not all reduce your time generally by hour or sometimes by hour each If you fail you have to replay part or all of the game in order to advance to the second part of the game hellip the trial
In thesecond partof L amp O you help the Assistant District Attorney A D A
hellip Serena Southerlyn to obtain a ldquo Guilty rdquo verdict at the subsequent trial of your suspect This part is more complex since it consists of several watertight consecutive sections and will be described fully at the beginning of part
As opposed to most Quest Adventure games do NOT ldquo pick up every item which is not nailed down rdquo amp or try to perform every action possible If you do this you will very rapidly run out of time and have to return to some previous stage You have to restrict yourself to theminimumofessentialitems actions amp questions in order to conserve time as much as possible
Note There is space for up to items in the lsquo inventory rsquo of your case file If you want to store any additional you can use the trash can to make room But beverycareful how you do this I don rsquo t think you can reclaim any item once you have removed it hellip and you might need it later for essential evidence
Note The ldquo Updates rdquo above are likely to modify some of this section I have inserted inredsome lsquo very average rsquo times left at various stages You may have more time left good or less not so good However if you just have lsquo reasonable rsquo numbers of hours less don rsquo t worry because all the times which just happen to be listed here finish with considerably more hours in part over DAYS to spare than necessary
At the beginning of both halves of the game you are prompted to select either one or a maximum of two out of four lsquo skills rsquo lsquo strengths rsquo hellip the game will not permit you to select more than two
Once you have made your choice at the very beginningof each half you will be UNABLEto change your selection without returning again to the beginnings
This walkthrough has made one of themanypossible selections which enable you to finish each half of the game satisfactorily and with scores of each It was possibly NOT the wisest choice
In practice it is probably better to adopt the following plan similar to a strategy suggested in the game rsquo s manual a Use the ldquo Evidence Collection rdquo skillthroughout the whole gameto provide yourself with a magnifying glass which highlights all amp only the items you can interact with hellip if you do not choose it you will have to performvery frustratingpixel hunts over the whole areas of some screens
b Use also the ldquo Efficiency rdquo skill which allows you to roam around as much as you like whilst conserving time particularly if you rsquo ve applied the patch and hence enabled almost unlimited time hellip see ldquo Updates rdquo above
c Once you get used to the game it doesn rsquo t take long to restart and repeat what you rsquo ve already played
So if when you get stuck or reach a dead end restart but use the ldquo Teamwork rdquo skill instead of ldquo Efficiency rdquo in order to obtain some helpful built in hints
d Go back and forth between b amp c as often as you need to
Whenever you see the cell phone icon blinking you can click on it Frequently you are given quite important clues hinting at what to do next or sometimesabsolutelyessentialinfo But quite often you just get some purely background blurb which is not really vital to progressing in the game
In part if you have chosen the appropriate lsquo skill s rsquo Van Buren writes hints from time to time on the chalkboard in the th Precinct
These are generally helpful if you are stuck An equivalent situation applies in part to faxes sent by the District Attorney Douglas Wade and received in the Assistant District Attorney rsquo s office
However cell phone calls generally ldquo cost rdquo hour whilst accessing the chalkboard amp or faxesalwaysdo
I rsquo ve included ALL cell phone time deductions in this walkthrough since the game appears to imply this But I have included NO time deductions for chalkboard or faxes since they may not be available in some lsquo skill combinations rsquo Of course you can always lsquo cheat rsquo with all these hints Save immediatelybeforeaccessing access amp obtain the info then return to your Save with no time deduction In generalSAVE FREQUENTLY It isveryeasy to make a wrong or redundant move
You have save slots If you like you can save batches of up to lsquo permanently rsquo zipping if you like before overwriting
PART hellip DETECTIVE Select ldquo Evidence Collection rdquo and ldquo Teamwork rdquo lsquo skills rsquo and then ldquo Done rdquo
See in the ldquo PREFACE rdquo above Then watch the cut scenes displaying the discovery of the body at the crime scene

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
Law amp Order Double or Nothing Walkthrough Len Green th September lengreen hotmail com PREFACE This walkthrough describes theabsolute MINIMUM actions onlywhich youmusttake in order to succeed hellip or non essentials may have slipped in by mistake However please don rsquo t use this walkthroughunless youabsolutely have to Many items actions and even some lsquo secondary rsquo locations which are not absolutely essential have been omitted A lot of these are interesting and provide the background story to the game
ldquo Warning rdquo The main purpose of this game is to examine clues interview witnesses amp suspects etc Some of these actions are essential but many are fruitless or even red herrings hellip as in real life investigations If you simply take this walkthrough in your hand and follow exactly what to do amp not to do you can probably finish the game in roughly hours only This would completely defeat its whole purpose
The object of thefirst partof L amp O is for you to assist the detective Lennie Briscoe to arrest the correct suspect Until you succeed in this you cannot advance to the second part of the game hellip the trial
In thesecond partof L amp O you help the Assistant District Attorney A D A
hellip Serena Southerlyn to obtain a ldquo Guilty rdquo verdict at the subsequent trial of your suspect This part is more complex since it consists of several watertight consecutive sections which will be described fully at the beginning of part
At some stage s in the game you may need to review exactly what you have done amp or not done EVERY action which has been performed is listed in your log book hellip at the right side of your navigation bar There is space for up to items in your case file lsquo inventory rsquo hellip which is actually alot However it accommodates A objects and photographs of various characters but also B authorizations of the results of various tests researches and surveillances
If and when your case file gets filled completely you can dump items into the trash can to make room if you need to store more But beverycareful how you do this You CANNOT reclaimany A item once you have trashed it hellip and you might need it later for essential evidence e g
for obtaining warrants etc
Youcanreplace B items if required However there will bemanyobjects in your case file which you have picked up and sent for lab testing and research and have produced lsquo no results rsquo If you need more room you can trash any of these without lsquo danger rsquo
In several cases somebody who is being interviewed by the police refuses to cooperate This situation is accompanied by a partial case file appearing on the right hand third of the screen When you select click on the appropriate icon in this partial case file the person interviewed will come clean A similar method is used to open a locked door or drawer etc
At the beginning of both halves of the game you are prompted to select either one or a maximum of two out of four lsquo skills rsquo lsquo strengths rsquo hellip the game will not permit you to select more than two
Once you have made your choice at the very beginningof each half you will be UNABLEto change your selection without returning again to the beginnings
This walkthrough has made only one of themanypossible selections not necessarily the lsquo best rsquo
which enable you to finish both halves of the game satisfactorily and with scores of The choices suggested were as follows and for the reasons given a Choose the ldquo Evidence Collection rdquo skillthroughout the whole gameto provide yourself with a magnifying glass which highlights all amp only the items you can interact with hellip if you donotchoose it you will have to performvery frustratingpixel hunts over the whole areas of some screens
b Choose the ldquo Teamwork rdquo skillthroughout the whole gamein order to obtain some helpful built in hints In part of the game if ever you are totally stuck you can generally obtain a vital hint from Van Buren on the chalkboard in the th Precinct An equivalent situation applies in part to faxes sent by the District Attorney Douglas Wade and received in the Assistant District Attorney rsquo s office
The hints and there aremany are NOT included in this walkthrough since they are built into the game itself Whenever you see the cell phone icon blinking you should click on it You will be alerted to completed info from the various quarters where you have requested processing Occasionally you will also get hints on your cell phone as well as odd superfluous calls from lsquo outsiders rsquo
As a result of these early prompt calls you may find some belated instructions in the walkthrough have been performed already hellip e g
to go to the Crime Lab or Records amp Research etc after you have already obtained the info available at these places
If you happen to get results lsquo tooearly rsquo that rsquo s perfectly OK The only hold ups which are likely to occur are if you rsquo re lsquo toolate rsquo
No mention of any of these cell phone calls is made in the walkthrough
It rsquo s more than likely that there may be times when the ldquo technicians rdquo are not yet ready to supply your requests and you can rsquo t continue until they manage to do so In any such case s when the reports are still pending simply mark time by visiting and talking toanybody You may have to lsquo talk rsquo to more than one person until the reports are ready
You rsquo ll generally get a cell phone call when the particular reports you are waiting for are available
In order to see thewholemap don rsquo t forget to scroll it down or up
All you need to do is to move your cursor to the bottom or top of the map This will produce down or up black arrows and scroll appropriately and automatically
You can also use the slider bar and down up arrows to the right of the map itself
You frequently have to add a witness to your case file However you can rsquo t actually add thegraphicof the witness Instead you add the lsquo witness summary rsquo but obtain a lsquo photoicon rsquo of the witness in your case file
There are only two lsquo standard rsquo puzzles in the game If you happen to get stuck their detailed and graduated solutions are at the end of this walkthrough They are in text form for those who like to print walkthroughs without wasting much ink
For those who so wish additional graphic solutions are included at the VERY end and can be deleted by those who don rsquo t want them
WARRANTS If you fail to obtain either a search warrant or an arrest warrant enter your case fileagainand look beneath the box marked ldquo Supporting Evidence amp Witnesses rdquo The number of your correct items is always listed there By adding amp or subtracting different icons you can fairly easily determine which are necessary and which are not
In this walkthrough an occasional item may be listed which is not essential hellip but don rsquo t take that for granted If you enter ALL those listed you arecertainto get your warrant
NOTE If you want to use more than items you can easily do so by utilizing the slider on the right side of the box marked ldquo Supporting Evidence amp Witnesses rdquo
If when you repeat any part of the game Note that when interviewing witnesses or suspects the same choices of questions will be displayed but in different random lsquo orders rsquo each time You may sometimes think that you have not achieved the best result s when interviewing somebody In that case you can use the eraser which appears on the navigation bar It deletes that interview and allows you to make hopefully better choices
N B The selection and order of displayed questions is as described in
In generalSAVE FREQUENTLY It isveryeasy to make a wrong or redundant move
You have save slots If you like you can save batches of up to lsquo permanently rsquo zipping if you like before overwriting

ENCRYPTION Puzzle I solved this puzzle by lsquo brute force rsquo only using trial amp error There is quite likely a better method than the one I used hellip but although not elegant this method at least succeeded
If when you choose what turns out to be an incorrect letter then sooner or later you obtain a group of letters which cannot under any circumstances form an English word something like ldquo YGA rdquo This means that you will have to backtrack and try some alternative letter somewhere
If anybody is stuck maybe or or or whatever belowalone will be sufficient help to finish solving the whole puzzle
Look at the th row down The left hand word consists of one letter only This letter can only be ldquo A rdquo or ldquo I rdquo Try whichever you prefer
Fill in the correct one which is ldquo I rdquo
Now look at the fifth word along the same line It consists of two letters only of which the first is ldquo I rdquo The second letter can only be ldquo F rdquo ldquo N rdquo ldquo S rdquo or ldquo T rdquo Try whichever you prefer
Fill in the correct one which is ldquo T rdquo
Now look at the third word along the same line It consists of two letters only of which the first is ldquo T rdquo The second letter can only be ldquo O rdquo hellip so fill it in
Now look at the first word along the eighth line It consists of two letters only of which the first is ldquo I rdquo The second letter can NOW only be ldquo F rdquo ldquo N rdquo or ldquo S rdquo Try whichever you prefer Fill in the correct one which is ldquo S rdquo
The last word in the seventh line down is a long one hellip letters Four of the last six are as follows ldquo T rdquo ldquo rdquo ldquo T rdquo ldquo I rdquo ldquo O rdquo ldquo rdquo How about filling in the missing two letters making most probably ldquo T rdquo ldquo A rdquo ldquo T rdquo ldquo I rdquo ldquo O rdquo ldquo N rdquo
The seventh word in the fourth line down has now got only one letter missing which is almost certainly ldquo H rdquo Fill it in
The sixth lsquo word rsquo in the eighth line down has now got only one letter missing which must be ldquo P rdquo Fill it in
The second word in the fourth line down has now got only one letter missing
The only letter which fits and makes grammatical sense is ldquo W rdquo Fill it in
The very first word of the email is missing five letters The most likely word to fit in at the very beginning of such an email is ldquo CONFIDENTIAL rdquo
Fill in the five missing letters
The third word in the eighth line down is missing two letters They are ldquo R rdquo and ldquo V rdquo Enter them correctly
The first word in the third line down is missing one letter only
It must be ldquo M rdquo hellip so fill that in
The fourth word in the fourth line down is also missing one letter
The only one which makes sense is ldquo K rdquo hellip so fill it in
The third word in the fifth line down is missing one letter only
It must be ldquo U rdquo hellip so fill that in
There are by now only seven letters left and the email is almost completed hellip so finish it off
When you have finished it you get the following message on your screen with no boxes etc

Law amp Order Justice is Served Walkthrough Len Green st October lengreen hotmail com FOREWORD Particularlyfor those who have played previous L amp O games
I would like to thank Legacy Interactive and in particular Christina Oliver for their cooperation and assistance
L amp O is considerably different from the previous games of the series IMHO it has been greatly improved inmanyways this is not to imply that the previous versions were not good games Each one of the series has been a great improvement on the previous game Several justified criticisms from players have been absorbed amp corrected by the Developers to their credit hellip not every Company is so considerate
It is VERY much longer and hence more complex There are around a dozen and a half actual lsquo traditional rsquo puzzles of varying degrees of difficulty hellip mostly not all that hard
The interface and general game mechanisms are substantially the same but have been altered streamlined and improvedgreatly I shall not describeanyof these improvements or their functioning since these are ALL explained in the manual
Please note that this walkthrough may be subject toslightchanges if the game is updated
PREFACE A This walkthrough describes theabsolute MINIMUM actions onlywhich youmusttake in order to succeed hellip or non essentials may have crept in by mistake However please don rsquo t use this walkthroughunless youabsolutely have to Many items actions and conversation topics which are not absolutely essential have been omitted A lot of these are interesting and provide much of the background story to the game
ldquo Warning rdquo The main purpose of this game is to examine clues interview witnesses amp suspects etc Some of these actions are essential but many are fruitless or even red herrings hellip as in real life investigations If you simply take this walkthrough in your hand and follow exactly what to do amp not to do you can probably finish the game relatively quickly This would completely defeat its whole purpose
B The object of thefirst partof L amp O is for you to assist the detectives Lennie Briscoe amp Ed Green no relativeJ to arrest the correct suspect Until you succeed in this you cannot advance to the second part of the game hellip the trial
In thesecond partof L amp O you help the Assistant District Attorney A D A
hellip Serena Southerlyn to obtain a ldquo Guilty rdquo verdict at the subsequent trial of your suspect This part is more complex since it consists of several watertight consecutive sections which will be described fully at the beginning of part
Incidentally you CAN get scores of hellip but this is not essential to complete the game fully and successfully
C At some stage s in the game you may need to review exactly what you have done amp or not done All essential actions which have been performed are recorded in your log book
D You shouldNOT haveto follow the identical order of interviewing characters or accessing locations as described in this walkthrough Some locations of course will not appear on the map until you have completed certain tasks and so aparticularorder issometimesessential
E In order to see thewholemap don rsquo t forget to scroll it down or up see the right hand side of the map
F The inventory structure of L amp O is quite a bit different from the previous L amp O games
In particular please note the following Your inventory is presentall the timenear the bottom of the screen It is actually FOUR separate inventories from left to right and using my personal terminology hellip hellip hellip
lsquo persons inventory rsquo lsquo objects inventory rsquo lsquo documents inventory amp lsquo reports inventory rsquo When you PICK UP any object hand icon it isautomaticallyplaced into the appropriate one of the abovementioned inventories which glows for a short while whilst it is entered If you doNOT deliberately pick it up it will not be there of course
G You very frequently have to obtain assistance from the various police departments To do this you have to drag an appropriate item from one of the aforementioned inventories at the bottom of the screen into one of lsquo submission rsquo folders and then submit These folders are from top to bottom i Lab oratory ii Research iii Surveillance iv Psych
ological Eval uation
To access these folders you have to travel on the map to the ldquo th Precinct rdquo in part of the game and to the ldquo District Attorney rdquo in part of the game
Results for ii amp iii above are obtained from the ldquo th Precinct rdquo i from the ldquo Crime Lab rdquo and iv from the Psychiatrist
H From time to time particularly if you rsquo re stuck access the cell phone for voice mail phone calls you can make and assistance from your Supervisors If you wish to know whether you arereadyto obtain a warrant or subpoena etc access your cell phone and ask your Supervisor who will tell you generally correctlyJ
If the voice mail contains any incoming calls it means that you should go to the appropriate place to receive info that you asked for earlier
After you have requested help from lsquo Records amp Research rsquo lsquo Surveillance rsquo lsquo Crime Lab rsquo or lsquo Psychiatrist rsquo the results will not be availableinstantaneously but generally after you have visitedonly one usually ANY location
I lsquo ACTIONS rsquo and PUZZLES denotes lsquo actions rsquo of various types
denotes puzzles
The solutions of all puzzles will be given in graduated form etc so that the player who is stuck may quite probably only need to read the first one or two hints rather than animmediatefinal spoiler hellip which will be printed so that it is less easy to read
As far as possible the puzzle solutions will be described textually so as not to provide immediate spoilers But in some cases this is impossible due to randomization or insufficient accuracy
Therefore quite a number of graphics have been added to some puzzles These graphics are ALL concentrated at the very end of this walkthrough
Wherever a graphic is available it is internally linked to its appropriate puzzle generally at its end
J In general SAVE FREQUENTLY It is very easy to make a wrong or redundant move
You have save slots If you like you can save batches of up to lsquo permanently rsquo zipping if you like before overwriting hellip for the next batch of

Label the squares from the left bottom corner upwards lsquo A rsquo thro rsquo lsquo E rsquo and from the left bottom corner to the right lsquo rsquo thro rsquo lsquo rsquo
Briscoe starts in the empty square ldquo B rdquo
Most of the time you will be dragging boxes and in the ONLY DIRECTION that theycanmove This will be denoted simply as ldquo C rdquo for example hellip meaning that you drag the box standingonthe square C in theonly directionthat the box on C can move Crates double or triple squares will be designated for example as ldquo A B C rdquo Occasionally a box or crate can be moved in directions This will be marked as U p D own R ight or L eft e g ldquo C R rdquo would mean hellip move the box on C to the right and not to any other lsquo accessible rsquo direction
From time to time Briscoe can move and a circular icon indicates the squarewhere you want him to moveTO As an example B means that you want Briscoe to move ONTO square B

Author commentsFirst of all I want to tell you that this is not a screen by screen walkthrough
The way I design this walkthrough will make you understand the flow of the story while finishing the game itself
You will not be bothered by questions like Why do I have to do this
Why should I take this objects
etc
So you might think for example that this walkthrough will not tell you to take an object in a certain place at the first time
Eventually you'll take that object after I'll tell you the reason behind those actions
So you won't collecting all items first and wondering about the uses later on
There are few bugs in the game that will make you stuck for good
You don't have to worry about it because I'll tell you about the bugs before you experience it
Not all objects are obvious so sometime you have to figure it out by yourself

From the Player's Handbook we learn that the Lighthouse is the home of Dr Krick and is the location of his laboratory and that the object of the game is to rescue him and his baby daughter Amanda
It also tells us that the game is comprised of distinct regions to explore with numerous challenging puzzles
While the puzzles are at times quite difficult they can be solved
A few can be solved in different ways and you often have a choice of the order in which you do the puzzles and explore the different regions
This guide will attempt to cover all situations
The tone of the guide will besee all tell all so it is up to your discretion and discipline to read no further than necessary so you do not learn more than you really wanted to
A technical note is warranted here
Sierra has patches available which in addition to correcting deficiencies make some puzzles easier to solve
This guide is based on the latest as of Dec version
Any patches should be installed before the game is started since previously saved games will not be useable in the new game version

As you rummage through the single room you keep an eye on the thunder squall raging outside
The first thing that catches your eye is the telephone
You listen to the messages on the phone and get your first notion of the urgency of the task before you
When you read the journal in the desk drawer you begin to realize its magnitude
You find alighterin a file box on the desk
At about that time you see a bolt of lightning strike the lighthouse in the distance
Searching through the drawer of the smaller desk you come up with a set ofcar keys
As you dash out the door clicking the keys on the car you grab theumbrellaandinventory bagfrom the coat rack by the door
the lighthouse Well thank goodness for small favors
It has quit raining as you step out of the car
Checking the mailbox you find aletter
Walking toward the door you notice all the lights are out and wonder how much damage that lightning bolt did
You search all the common hiding places for keys and find thedoor keyunder one of the objects sitting on the stoop and anotherkeyinside the light fixture
Having noticed a small shed on the side of the building as you approached the house you decide to try the second key there
You find the key does indeed fit and the first thing you notice is the electric panel where you try to turn the lights back on
Success
Or at least partially so two of the three breaker switches reset with no problem
The third one though still exhibits a fault in the circuit
Looking around you find and take apry barfrom the shed and return to the front door
Noticing that some of the house lights are now on you try the door key in the lock on the front door
You half way expect it not to work things are going too well
But it does and the door opens allowing you to enter
You see several doors and like a true adventurer you choose the first one on the right
The room seems to be a study with book shelves at one end a desk at the other and some curio shelves along another wall
You find a tiny replica of abird a collection ofshells and a pair of strangetear drop shaped objectswith a bright red color among the curios
You put these things in your inventory although you haven't the foggiest notion of how you'll be able to use them
At the desk you find aletter openerin the upper drawer and somepagesfrom Dr Krick's journal when you look inside the roll top
Next to the pages you discover a strange box which you can turn but not pick up
As you read the journal pages you come to believe that the box is the object he is describing
You are determined to investigate the box but decide to explore the rest of the house first
Crossing to the book shelves on the other side of the room you move a few books on the middle shelf
This reveals a wall safe something else to investigate when you've finished touring the house
The next room on the right turns out to be the bedroom Amanda Dr Krick's baby daughter is in her crib
You pick up atoy soldierfrom the floor and cross to the far side of the room
There on the night stand you discover some morepagesfrom the journal
Baby Amanda although fussing a bit seems to be alright so you turn to continue your tour of the house picking up analarm clockfrom a table on the way out
The next door on the right seems substantial enough to be a vault door and it is locked with a high tech combination lock so you pass it for now and go to the room across the hall from the nursery
It is a combination den and kitchen
You find some more journalpageson the kitchen counter and add them to your collection
Finding ababy's bottlewith some milk in the refrigerator you decide to take it to Amanda
Click on Amanda and she starts crying
Then get the bottle from your inventory and click it on her
This sequence isn't necessary to complete the game but it adds a little realism
If you don't click on the baby she won't start crying and won't need the bottle
The next item you pick up initiates the kidnap sequence if it hasn't already occurred
It won't be long till you hear the baby crying again and when you go to investigate you'll see Dark Being abduct her and disappear through a portal to the parallel world
This is an ideal spot to save your game
Whether or not you decide to pursue the scoundrel you may want to return to this point to try the alternate option Whichever route you take you must return again to the lighthouse from the parallel world
You cannot completely solve the box in the desk until you bring an item back for it
If you decide to go after Dark Being clickHEREto jump to that section

Returning to the den you cross the room to a bookcase
You open the door and find acompass which you add to your inventory
Seeing nowhere else to explore you turn to the items in your inventory
You use the letter opener to open the letter and find a short note inside
The numbers beneath the message appear to be a safe combination so you head toward the study and the wall safe you saw there
Click on the safe to get a close up view
The cursor will turn into a clockwise arrow when placed on the right side of the knob or a counterclockwise arrow on the left
The knob will spin rather rapidly if you hold the mouse button down
Click off one number at a time when you want greater control Turn the dial one complete turn to the right before stopping on Turn the dial one complete turn to the left passing once and stop on Turn the dial back to the right and stop on the first time you come to it When done correctly the close up view of the knob will change to show the front of the safe
Click on the handle to open it
You won't be able to remove one item in the safe probably the will he mentioned in the letter which you don't need
You remove thejournalfrom the safe and while scanning the pages you find another combination on one of the diagrams page
You think that might be what you need for that locked door but now that you're back in the study you're itching to tackle that mysterious box
puzzle box If you've completed all of the box except the last puzzle clickHEREto jump there
ClickHEREto defer the box solution till later
The box is the gift that Dr Krick received from Martin and mentioned in his journal
You recall Martin mentioned it in his notes too saying that inside it he had hidden a piece of the weapon designed to capture Dark Being
You notice that each side of it has some sort of latch at its center some that you push and others that you turn
Most of them seem inoperative at the moment but you finally find one that unlatches its side
You proceed with confidence readily solving the first puzzle of the box by pressing all the small square blocks in order from the top down then sliding some lower blocks that are now free to move
This reveals a small red button which you push
You proceed with confidence readily solving the first puzzle of the box by pressing all the small square blocks in order from the top down then sliding some lower blocks that are now free to move
This reveals a small red button which you push
The box seems to come alive closing the side where you were working and opening the back side of it
When you turn the box to examine that side you see what resembles a target with a redbull's eye
You press thebull's eyealmost by instinct and the box moves again this time exposing the side to the left as well as the one that's open
It seems to be inviting you to press that side's button so you do
The box then turns its open side away from you as if to demure so you must turn it back where you can see the open side and press thebull's eyeagain
This time a drawer opens and you remove akey
Another press of thebull's eyecauses the drawer to close and the box to turn to another side
This side is open a mere crack and you turn the box toward you to see better
Part of the design inside becomes visible and you notice what appear to be two push buttons
When you push the one on the right you find the reason Dr Krick could proceed no further
It's one of those ubiquitous sliding block puzzles
And there's no doubt in your mind that when solved it should look like that hawk figure sketched in his notes
The starting configuration is completely random so there is no single solution
You may leave the puzzle and come back to try to achieve a more advantageous starting configuration
There is a built in method to bypass the puzzle
If you leave the puzzle and come back to it four times you'll be offered asolvebutton
Alternatively you can use the following strategy to solve it
It is not extremely difficult although it takes some time
The space that remains vacant is at the lower right
You start solving by identifying the blocks that belong in the top row which is relatively simple since they show the curved arc of the upper part of the circle
Then you line them up in sequence somewhere below the top row
When they're in the proper order you slide the whole row into place one after the other
There is no need to disturb that row once it's in place
Now you repeat the process for the next rows
You realize the final two rows must be solved simultaneously so you move the blocks in a circuitous fashion with one row moving right and the other left so as not to disturb the other rows that are already in position
You make corrections in the block's positions while you're moving them until both rows slide into position
You resist the urge to grab the strip that then protrudes from the box until you have made a note of the symbols you see on it
Then as soon as you touch it it retracts into the box again and that side closes
The sequence was circle triangle square cross in case you missed it
You turn the box to find another active latch
When you find one that turns that side doesn't open so you continue trying and find another active latch
This time the side opens to show you a mosaic of tiles
After trying several unproductive sequences you push all the blue tiles and then the lower one shaped like a fish
The fish swings out revealing a button which you press and the fish swings closed again
You think the same technique might work again and after a few experiments you press all the gray tiles and then the upper fish shaped one causing it to swing out
Behind the fish is a key hole into which you immediately place the key you obtained from an earlier puzzle
That whole side swings open revealing a gray disk
The next step in the solution of the puzzle box requires an inventory item from the parallel world
If you don't have Martin's medallion the final solution of the puzzle box must wait until you bring it back
You place the medallion you took from Martin's corpse on the disk
Two spaces with a familiar shape are left vacant
After a moment's thought you remember the red objects you found on the shelves
You try them and they fit perfectly
You press the button on the top of the box and the side swings up revealing the final puzzle
You see a cylinder with moveable rings that have symbols on them
You adjust them so they all show a square and hear a faint click
Then you set them all so the circle is showing and see the top move slightly
Now you set them to the triangle and the bottom ring moves
Suddenly you remember the symbols on the strip that protruded from the box earlier and set the rings to those symbols
The whole cylinder now opens and you take the smallvialfrom inside
laboratory You are ready to learn what's behind that locked door
You remember the group of numbers from the journal pages and plan to try them on the lock
Disregarding the hyphens you click on each of the five digits in order and then click ENTER
It worked
The door slides open and you can see Dr Krick's laboratory you step inside
Several pieces of strange equipment are visible but you recognize the viewing screen of a computer monitor and you head toward it
It seems to be working but its read out doesn't hold out much hope for the rest of the equipment
You look over the odds and ends on a table to the left of the computer monitor and pick up some more journalpages a piece offuse wire anelectron tube and atoolof some sort
Thus equipped you begin checking out the equipment
There was some equipment to the right as you came in that had red coils around it
Go back to it and turn on a switch inside a little door on it the red coils start flashing
A check of the computer now shows the memory to be working Turn to the right of the computer monitor and open the door on a large round part of the computer
Replace the burnt electron tube with one from inventory
Replace the fuse wire beside it with a new one and use the tool to solder both ends
The computer now shows that the hardware is enabled but there's no power Go back outside to the shed and turn on the power switch that wouldn't stay on earlier
Now the computer says that power is OK but that a lever and a power modulator are at fault Turn around to the control panel opposite the computer monitor
Turn on all eight of the switches on that panel
Then pull the left lever
The fresnel lens rises to the upper level of the lighthouse
Now the computer says the only fault is the power modulator
You start looking around some more for the power modulator notes in the doctor's journal indicate that it is some sort of tube
You noticed a storage bin earlier between the computer and the door but couldn't open it
Now you decide to try the pry bar on it
After two tries it gives way and you take one of the threepower modulatortubes
You also know from the journal that it has to go into the fresnel lens high up in the lighthouse
You go up the stairs by the door and encounter a locked scuttle
You aren't going to be stopped now by a little lock so you attack it with the pry bar
It falls in pieces after only three blows and you have access to the upper level
You open the door on the fresnel lens and remove the old spent power modulator
Replacing it with the new one you just found you close the door and plug in the wire from the lightning rod on top
On your way down the stairs you think about needing a new power modulator for each time the portal is opened and decide to take a secondpower modulatoras a spare
Retrying the computer you find that everything is now working
You turn around to the control panel again and pull the other lever
The portal opens and you step through
martin's roost If you've already explored this area clickHEREto jump to where you chose how to leave
Whether you travelled via Dr Krick's machine or were deposited here by Dark Being after he conked you on the head when you followed him you now find yourself on the beach in the parallel world
You wonder around awhile picking up a fewsmall stones before discovering a pier extending out over the water
As you approach the pier you find a corked bottle among some flotsam beside the pier
Removing the cork you take anotefrom inside the bottle
You continue to explore the pier going to the very end of it and down a few steps
You find a T shapedtoolof some sort on the lower landing
That seems to be the only thing of interest on the pier so you go back to the beach and travel toward a tower you've noticed in the distance continuing to pick up small stones when you see them
You notice as you approach the tower known as Martin's Roost that the drawbridge is open
Examining the metallic bezels on the stone abutments you discover that the left one opens to reveal a hole
You try using that tool you found on the pier as a key and a panel opens uncovering a joy stick type control
Taking a closer look you see that it controls a hook which must be moved through a type of maze to engage and lift another hook
This second hook in turn releases the mechanism that allows the bridge to drop
Moving the joy stick will move the hook in the same direction as far as the next intersection or change of direction
Like some of the other controls in this game it may be difficult to operate with the mouse
You may find the arrow keys on the keyboard work better If you need help with the maze itself it's click to the left down left then click each down right down right down left and up
If you need help with the maze itself it's click to the left down left then click each down right down right down left and up
You proceed up a walkway that encircles the tower as it spirals upward
You pass a door and make a mental note to explore it on your way back down
You haven't gone far when one of the mechanical birds that has been circling overhead roosts beside a gate you were about to open as if to guard it
You soon learn that is indeed true since it attacks you as you try to enter
Something about a clock on the wall by the gate catches your eye
You think it must somehow be involved with the gate and proceed to put it back in operation
You decide that it is a cuckoo clock because of the door and that the little bird in your inventory might belong there
You take thewind up keyfrom the toy soldier in your inventory
Using the key to wind up the bird you place it in the clock
A small push of the pendulum starts the clock working and the guard bird leaves
In case either the key from the toy soldier or the little bird is missing from your inventory there is another solution to the bird problem
Throwing stones at them will knock them out but it takes stones per bird and there are birds
You'd probably have to make at least one more trip back to the beach for more stones This is also a good time to save your game you are approaching a critical spot also you will soon have to choose between two paths to take
This is also a good time to save your game you are approaching a critical spot also you will soon have to choose between two paths to take
You continue up the walkway and enter a room
You surmise the corpse you see is that of Martin
You remove themedallionfrom around his neck
If you should happen to bump the skull it will clatter to the floor
Don't let this startle you
He is obviously beyond help so you cross to the desk to start searching it
Birdman flying around outside will come in the window and take something you need from the desk unless you act to stop him
If that should happen you'll find it later somewhere else you may want to try this in a subsequent game
To prevent this you must close and lock the window step below before you do anything else at the desk
The other steps may be done in any order Open drawer of the desk and remove two screws from a compartment at the front
Open the compartment and take thekey
Go close the window and lock it with the key Open drawer and pick up thethrottle handlefor the submarine
This is what Birdman would have taken
Open drawer and move the file folders
Take thekeyyou find in one of them Open drawer and click in the middle of the parts to move them
Then click on the parts at the right rear corner to move them
Click again in the middle and take thecoiled wirelying on the bottom of the drawer Use the key you got from drawer to unlock compartment
Take thebat plane whistle Move one of the vases on shelf to the shelf above compartment and the other one to the shelf above drawer
Now open the side of the compartment next to shelf and remove theweapon piece In addition to the files in drawer you can read some of Martin's notes in the compartment next to drawer
On your way out you notice a scuttle in the ceiling with one end of a ladder protruding having no means of reaching it you proceed out the door
You mentally review all the strange things you've learned on your way back down the exterior walkway
You open the door you passed earlier and step into a short hallway
You see Birdman working in a shop directly ahead and a stairway leading down on the right
For a moment you hesitate pondering which way you should go
It is almost time to leave Martin's Roost to travel to the next region to explore and time for you to make your choice
The stairway leads to a submarine and the places you reach by water
The other route takes you by air to the temple
If Birdman got away with the throttle handle your options are limited and you'll have to go by air
If you opt to go by submarine clickHERE
Entering the workshop will be a little easier if you've waited until Birdman isn't there
In that case you can skip the first paragraph below
As you approach the workshop Birdman sees you and pulls a lever which closes a gate
You pitch a stone at Birdman's head then quickly lob another one at the lever which operates the gate
You enter the shop quickly before Birdman recovers sufficiently to close the gate again
Realizing he was outsmarted he leaves you quickly close the window and lock it with the key
Moving to the workbench you pick up a strangemultipurpose tooland a handful ofmiscellaneous hardware
On a small table you find some sort ofremote controlbox
It doesn't seem to be working so you place it on the bench with a power screwdriver attached and use it to open the remote control box
You loosen the two terminals with the multipurpose tool and remove a damaged coiled wire
You replace it with the one you got from the desk upstairs and close the remote control up again
If you didn't get Birdman locked out in time he will beat on the remote control with the hammer
The only damage he does however is to knock the antenna off
If this happens pick up the antenna from beside the hammer and replace it on the remote control
Picking up the remote control you try it and find it to be working now
And you discover that one of its functions is to control a ladder
You immediately head back to the upstairs living quarters where you found the inaccessible ladder
You select the ladder function on the remote control and press the button
The ladder lowers and you scramble up it and through a scuttle in the ceiling
Emerging into a cluttered loft you turn completely around scanning the room before you even try moving
You discover a desk right behind you and see some plans for some sort of aircraft
Also on the desk you find ahex keytype of wrench
There is some type of launching track going through the middle of the room and it looks like you'll have to climb over it to get to the other side of the room
In doing so you almost trip over a pile ofgears which you pick up from the floor
Having more room to move around on the other side you move to the rear where you see another ladder
Ascending it you find the roosting area of the mechanical birds you saw earlier
You think it possible that they might be controllable by the other functions of the remote control
Indeed this author has heard rumors to that effect but has been unable to duplicate the action as of this writing
This section will be updated though if there are any late developments By the way if you disabled the mechanical birds by stoning them earlier you won't find them roosting here now
By the way if you disabled the mechanical birds by stoning them earlier you won't find them roosting here now
Returning to the lower level you find a control on a post next to the ladder
There are guard brackets on it preventing movement of the control arm
You use the hex key on them then move the control arm
You are startled by an aircraft of sorts that descends onto the launch track
Returning to the front part of the room you place the gears from your inventory on a stanchion which happens to be missing some gears next to the aircraft
You find acrankon a hook on the wall behind you and attach it to one of the gears
The wings on this aircraft in case you haven't noticed resemble those of a bat
That has earned it the name bat plane
There is even a high pitched whistle which you found in the desk that can be used to recall it if it is at the other end of the line and you are here
To use it set the pitch control to its highest position The craft is spring driven and you must wind up the spring so that the gauge inside registers in the blue area
Thirteen turns of the crank will do it any more will overload the system and it will completely unwind itself
If this happens just start winding again and count more carefully
One winding is enough power for a round trip

You bravely climb into the cockpit of this frail looking aircraft determined to make it fly
You spot a control handle on the left but it is prevented from moving by a black guard
You push and pull on it but it won't move
Finally you press on the pivot pin that holds the guard and it swings out of the way
You then move the lever and you're airborne
the temple of the ancient machines You arrived here by one of two flying machines the ornithopter from the Island Fortress or the bat plane from Martin's Roost
In either case find your way to the portico
From the bat plane which lands on a perch at ground level take an elevator up to the raised portico
The ornithopter lands on top of one of the chambers
Go down the stairs into that chamber then out the door to the portico
If you've already explored the temple and have returned to use the teleporter clickHERE
Once on the portico you find doors to three chambers and enter the middle one where you meet Liryl the guardian of the temple
She is lonely since her friends the priests have not yet returned from their latest voyage and you listen to her for a bit
You show her the note from the priests that you found in the bottle on the beach and give her some seashells that you happen to have in inventory
Liryl keeps talking even though she still regards you as a stranger so you risk being thought of as rude and turn your back to leave and explore the rest of this interesting place
You enter the chamber on the right and discover the Kinetic Sculpture which resembles an overgrown onion
It has a pair of spheres attached to some arms at its base and there are some chimes or bells on the ends of the arms
You discover that if you make the chimes on both ends jingle at the same time things happen first the spheres open to become eyes and then after more jingling the whole sculpture opens revealing an assortment of levers
You swing the two short levers near the bottom to the opposite sides to create a slot
The final position of the levers is critical to be sure you drag them all the way don't stop or let up on the mouse button until the cursor completely leaves the lever on the far side
You move the long lever in the middle forward and down into the slot
Jingling the chimes on both sides again you move the helical lever while they are still jingling and take theCDthat appears near the bottom
You remember reading in the game manual that the CD contains the history of this world that you must learn to gain Liryl's trust so you take it to the chamber on the left where you find a holographic CD player
Placing the CD on the player to your left you press the button to view the presentation you don't have to listen to all of it
You return to the middle chamber and turn left after reaching the center of the room
You approach the controls to what looks like an electromagnet
As soon as you move the activating lever Birdman suddenly appears and starts to attack Liryl dropping the throttle lever for the submarine on the floor if he has it
You haven't any experience with this machine but you move the levers anyway positioning the electromagnet near Birdman
After a few tries you eventually succeed in catching Birdman on the magnet
Liryl thanks you when you leave the electromagnet to go talk to her she says that she trusts you
You go to the control in the center of the room and move it downward and the floor of the room descends to the lower level
You see that this level is littered with old machinery
Without even turning you find acircuit boardinside a piece of equipment on the right
Then turning degrees to the left you find aweapon pieceinside a crate
Turning another degrees you see a display panel
You move closer to get a better view and find adrawingon the wall behind the display
The display lights up with a picture of the Dark Domain volcano and the coordinates of it when you click on the ram's horns
You make a note of these for later use
Clicking on each of the three crates in front of the display you find threerepair partsfor the machine on the upper level of the temple
You assemble the three pieces into a single assembly in the inventory viewer
Finding nothing else of importance on this level you return to the main level
The drawing you just found is for the weapon you are going to build
One of the pieces it shows the stock is already at the work area where you will assemble the weapon
The other six are scattered one at each of the six regions The upper level of the temple houses a teleporter that can transport you back to the lighthouse or some other places you've already visited
Your other option is to return on one of the aircraft and explore other paths from there RETURN TO MARTIN'S ROOSTRETURN TO ISLAND FORTRESS The upper level of the temple houses a teleporter that can transport you back to the lighthouse or some other places you've already visited
Your other option is to return on one of the aircraft and explore other paths from there
RETURN TO MARTIN'S ROOSTRETURN TO ISLAND FORTRESS You move the control lever in the center of the room upward and the floor moves to the upper level
You are facing a large control console pictures below and you study it for a few minutes before noticing a few large power modules to the left
You go to the left module and connect its electrical cord to an outlet supplying power to the system
You then go to the console and turn on switch and see the panel power up
You move to the TV screen on the right to select where you want to go
Turn the screen on with the button at its lower right corner Use the left knob below the screen to select the location you want Use the right knob below the screen to pick a particular room at that location Press the button by the right knob to enter your selection resulting in a red pattern on the display
You return to the center console and moving lever you watch a walkway unfold moving lever causes the dome of the roof to open
You turn on the viewing screen with button
Using the four knobs around the screen you align all the lines with the target when you get them all within the target circle they snap into perfect alignment with the center of the target
You keep a close watch on meter as it rises
When it indicates exactly on the line between white and red you turn on switch
Then you turn around find your way up the walkway to the open portal and are on your way after a few parting words with Liryl
If you allow the meter to rise into the red area the power supply inside door will be damaged and you'll have to replace some parts with those you found on the lower level
Then press another push button switch inside the door and start this sequence over RETURN TO LIGHTHOUSERETURN TO ISLAND FORTRESSRETURN TO MARTIN'S ROOSTRETURN TO SUBMARINE submarine In the hallway of Martin's Roost as you approach Birdman's shop you turn right between the two posts with green finials
You descend a stairway that twists and turns down to a loading dock at water level
The first thing you notice is a submarine bobbing in the water and your eye is drawn to the outlet to the sea which is blocked by a seagate of sorts
Realizing you must open that gate in order to go anywhere you start checking over the crane for no other reason than it's there
It proves to be operational but you only see a few items within its reach
If you've used the sub before clickHEREto skip the preliminaries
To operate the crane's controls click the spot where you want the control to move rather than dragging it
The vertical control for the hook works only at locations where it's useful
You use the crane's controls to swing the boom over one of the weights and lower the hook
Picking up the weight with the crane you swing the boom around to the only other place where you can lower it the counterbalance platform out in the water
The platform lowers slightly with the weight
Encouraged by your progress you repeat the process with the other weight the platform lowers some more but the gate remains closed
You swing the crane around to the only remaining item a loop of metal protruding from the floor
You lift the loop with the crane and this time the gate opens
You walk toward the submarine but there is no gangplank in place to get to the boat
You operate a nearby control wheel winding it counterclockwise to extend a gangplank
Then you quickly latch the wheel in place with a nearby lever and proceed to board the submarine
You take a few minutes to explore the boat ending your tour at the controls up front
The first time you use the sub you must install the throttle handle and make sure the switches that seal the water tight doors between compartments are in the upright position
These things will not usually need to be repeated
The remainder of the startup procedures will have to be repeated each time you go to sea
However most voyages are on the surface and Martin's Roost is the only location where adjustments must be made in the ballast
You turn on key switch which supplies power to the complete panel
Turning on engine room switch you head to the rear of the boat to start the engines
You turn a small handwheel to open the door and enter the engine room
When you move the lever on the right you are startled when many things in the room start moving
Returning to the control area you turn off switch and turn on ballast panel switch
Having too many switches on at one time overloads the system
Just behind the control area on the left side of the sub your left as you face the control area you find the ballast control panel
You move two levers that control the ballast tanks shown on the panel
Then you turn the left valve and the left pair of sight glasses begin filling
When the water level reaches the blue half way mark on those sight glasses you turn the other valve to begin filling the other sight glasses
You watch a video clip of the sub diving
Then you turn off switch and turn on the navigation room switch
About half way back on the boat's left you find the navigation computer
You examine the map tubes behind the desk and find one with the coordinates a much more accurate location for the shipwreck than the note from the bottle
The map opens when you click on it and you see a red target for each location already entered
You click one of the buttons over the keypad key in one of the coordinates you just found then click the other button and key in the other one
When you click onENTER a new target flashes at the bottom of the map
The target in the middle is the Island Fortress the one at lower right is Martin's Roost and the one at the very bottom is the Wreck of the Ironclad which you just entered
When you key in the coordinates for Dark Domain its target will be at the very top
When you click on one of these targets its coordinates appear on the keypad display
ClickENTERon the keypad that target will flash and that will be the sub's next destination
You now take a seat at the control panel and push the throttle lever forward
You watch the voyage in a video clip as the sub travels to the selected destination shutting itself down upon arrival
If you've arrived at either theIsland Fortressor theDark Domain you go to the main hatch and debark
If you're returning toMartin's Roost you turn the key switch back on along with the ballast panel switch and go to the ballast panel
You move one of the levers to jettison ballast and bring the sub to the surface then you debark via the hatch
If you've arrived at the shipwreck you continue below
the wreck of the ironclad Walking to the main hatch you descend into another hatch below it and enter a diving pod
You pull the undocking levers then turn to the panel on your right to operate the diving lever
You watch a video clip of the pod moving toward the shipwreck
You navigate the pod to a spot over a hatch on the front section of the wreck by pulling the propulsion lever five times with the directional control to the right then pulling it once with the directional control in the center
You then watch another video clip of the pod positioning itself over the hatch
Using the diving control to your right you descend into the hatch
You turn the pod degrees two turns in either direction with controls and spot a hook hanging on the wall see picture below
Mini sub positioned to grab the hook Undocking levers right one closes the hatch left one disconnects battery charging cables Direction control move to left or right if desired before pulling lever
Click on either side of the ball to move it Propulsion lever use with direction control to navigate around the shipwreck Lever to deploy robotic arm and its controls Controls for robotic arm keyboard arrow keys may work better for positioning the arm The red light above the viewing window indicates the robotic arm is in position to grab the hook in the center of the window
You deploy the robotic arm and position it under the hook at its lowest possible position
Then barely touching the control you inch the arm up in the smallest increment possible
Operating the lever that extends the arm in a grabbing motion you snag the hook off the wall
With the hook securely on the robotic arm you use the diving control on the right to ascend up out of that hold
You navigate the pod to a different part of the shipwreck using controls as before going left twice straight forward once left twice again and straight forward one more time
You think the pod must have a mind of its own the way it moves and turns inside the wreck and finally stops facing a skull
One of the priests
you think to yourself
Now you use the diving control again to ascend
Turning the pod once to the left you see a safe under several timbers
You use the arm to knock one timber away and then turn the pod to the left again
You now see why you needed the hook there is a massive timber with a piece of metal on its end
There is a hole in the metal piece and you line up your robotic arm to hook into that hole
You extend the arm and watch a video clip of the arm clearing the debris away from the safe leaving the pod facing the safe again
You extend the arm to open the door and once again to grab theweapon pieceinside
You learn the pod does indeed have a mind of its own since it now finds its own way back to the main sub RETURN TO SUBMARINE the island fortress You climb out of the submarine onto a pier
You haven't gone far when you notice a fishing pole stuck in a holder at the far end of the pier
From the way the pole is flexing you suspect there is something on the line
Clicking on that end of the pier you see a close up view of the rod and reel
You reel in afish
Turning you see a door into the fortress you go in and find yourself in a woodworking shop
Surveying the shop you find some power tools that are driven by a belt system from a power source somewhere nearby
There is a cluttered workbench on one wall with a crate full ofspare drive shaftson the floor in front of it you take one
Exploring a darker doorway you find you can't go far before encountering an unbridged canal
You try another doorway and discover the power source for the workshop good old wind power
You go to the windmill you see directly ahead of you and crank it up into the wind stream
You then pull the clutch lever that's near the crank
Looking to the left you see where the drive shaft turns the belt pulley and pull the lever to engage it
OOPS
Too late you realize you should have engaged the gearsbeforepulling the clutch
So you go release the clutch then get the spare drive shaft from your inventory and click it on the broken one to fix it
Then you engage the gears first and then go pull the clutch lever
NOTE The shaft has to be replaced only if it actually broke off
With power to the shop you now proceed to build a bridge across that canal
You go to the ripsaw and cut two stringers
Then on the crosscut saw you cut eight treads
You proceed to the dark doorway and place the stringers across the canal
You are about to lay the first tread when a monster appears and tears out the stringers
You go cut two more stringers while trying to figure a way of getting the bridge built in spite of the monster
As you pass the window by the door to the windmill room you hear something outside and go to look
Each time you look out the window after being away from it you'll see different things
Back off from the window and come back to see something else The first time you look down and see Dark Being teasing the monster with a fish The second time you look down and see the monster by himself The third time you look down and find the terrace empty the parapets above are empty too The fourth time you look up and see the monster moving toward the far tower The fifth time you see the monster moving toward the tower on the right After these first few times just watch for the monster moving toward the right tower
Seeing the monster moving toward the right tower you go back to rebuild the bridge
You cross over into the room beyond which appears to be a foundry
Moving to the far side you find a stairway and ascend to a tower which houses a cannon
You look around a bit and it's not long before the monster appears in another tower for sentry duty
You look at him through the telescope and decide to set things up for some target practice
Going back down the stairs you go back through the shop to the windmill room
You go up the stairs and into the base of the other tower where you see a statue and a ladder
Hoping not to come face to face with the monster you climb the ladder into the monster's sentry post
Looking up you see a hook on which you hang the fish you have in inventory
You now retrace your steps to where you found the cannon
You remove the pin in the base of the cannon and aim it at the monster's sentry tower
You then pick up acannon ball a piece offuse cordfrom a spool laying there and asack of gunpowder
Clicking on the cannon to get a close up view you open the breach of the cannon and load it with the gunpowder first and then the cannon ball
Closing the breach you place the fuze cord in the hole provided for it
Looking up from the cannon you wait for the monster to find the fish if he hasn't already
You get your lighter from inventory open the lid flick the flint wheel to light it and touch it to the fuse
Bye bye monster
Retracing your steps again you return to the tower above the windmill room where you saw the statue
This time you go around the statue and out the other door
You have free access to the walkway between the towers now that the monster is gone
You enter the other tower and find the loft where the other aircraft the ornithopter is kept
You notice it has a broken part but decide to investigate it later because right now you're more interested in something you see on the workbench to the right
You pick up akeyand head straight back to the statue in the other tower
You want to try the key in a locked compartment you saw in its base
It fits and you take aweapon pieceyou find in it and return to the workshop
It's option time again
You have a choice of returning to the submarine and traveling to another region or repairing the ornithopter and flying to the temple RETURN TO SUBMARINE Having decided to repair the ornithopter you enter the foundry where you plan to cast a new part for it
Turning to the left as you enter you find amoldfor the part on one of the benches
You walk around to the other side of the central work bench and place the mold in the middle of it
Finding somewoodand somecoalalong the wall you put first the wood then the coal into the furnace at the right end of the work bench
You set it ablaze using the lighter
You find someiron ingotsalong the same wall and place them in the crucible
You push the lever on the right to move the crucible into the furnace
You leave it there a full seconds to give it time to melt before pulling the lever to bring it out
Then you push a button along the edge of the bench to pour the molten metal into the mold
Using the lever beside the button you move the mold into the quenching tank
When the steaming stops you move it back to the work bench and open it
You pick up thenewly cast partand take it to the loft where you found the ornithopter
You move as close as possible to the damaged part and click the new part on it to fix it
You then turn toward the bench on the right and pull a lever which turns the aircraft around
At the rear of the aircraft you find a crank to wind it up
You click a button near the top of the mechanism to connect it to the aircraft and then crank it until it stops
Moving to the front of the ornithopter you jump into the cockpit
You move a lever on the left to move the aircraft to the end of the launch track
You move a knob on the right side of the control panel which unfolds the wings then a lever on the left side of the panel which starts them flapping
You now push a larger lever on the right and you're airborne JUMP TO THE TEMPLE OF THE ANCIENT MACHINES the dark domain As you arrive at Dark Domain Dark Being's lair you get a brief glimpse of an open drawbridge on a higher level
Clambering out of the submarine you happen to look to the left and see Dark Being through a window apparently he sees you too
You jump over to a dock where you see a driller train over to the left it's a large machine with an auger on the front a winch on the back and running on railroad tracks
But you find a locked gate across the tracks and start looking for a way to open it
Looking in the train's toolbox you see some dynamite and a few tools
You take thebolt cuttersand use them on the lock then you open the gate
Entering the train you turn on the main switch on its rear wall then you move to the front
You see a lever on the right which you surmise is the throttle because it has both forward and rearward movement
You press a button next to it and the engines come to life
There are other controls which you figure you'll learn about as needed
For now you click on the slot ahead of what you think is the throttle to move it and the train moves forward but it stops after going a short distance on what appears to be a turntable
You click on a red button on a small panel which appeared as the train stopped and find yourself outside on the turntable
The turntable appears to be mounted on tracks to move vertically as well as rotate and you go to one of the gearboxes nearby
You find a lever on it which you move and the turntable rises to the next level
Having more room at this level you look around and find tracks going in all four directions and they all look similar except for some boards above one track
You think this could be the granddaddy of all mazes and decide to take the compass out of inventory and use it
Doing this you learn that the eastbound track is the one with boards over it
This map shows the layout of the tracks and the steam pipes which power everything here
You'll find the map in the game as you explore the volcano but you won't be able to take it with you
Some locations have been numbered to help you orient yourself The dock where you landed
It is on a lower level than the other tracks Rock crusher room where Amanda is performing child labor
Notice the two steam pipes coming to the controls in front of where she sits Steam room and the entrance to the lava pit
The steam valves are aligned with the right most valve at the top of the map
This is also where you can find this map Location of the broken rail you must repair
Notice the small section of abandoned track nearby where you'll salvage a rail Work shop where you will assemble the weapon you have been collecting the pieces for
This is also the preferred entrance path to Dark Being's lab Dark Being's lab where you will revive Dr Krick and capture Dark Being

This is also the preferred entrance path to Dark Being's lab Dark Being's lab where you will revive Dr Krick and capture Dark Being
You click the red button again to reboard the train
Deciding to explore some of this maze of track you move the throttle to proceed on the eastbound track
After passing a few sidetracks you find yourself back at the turntable headed north
You continue across the turntable northbound and notice a red light appearing on the control panel next to a lever as the train approaches the switch to another side track
Never the less you continue on until the train comes to a stop where a gate across the tracks blocks the way
All of your attempts to breach this gate fail so you back the train back to the turntable stopping on it
You now proceed northbound again and this time when the red light comes on you move the lever by it
As you suspected it operates the track switch and you go in the other direction
NOTE This lever works on the switches only when the train is in motion
You haven't gone far when you see Dark Being and unfortunately he sees you
He releases a pile of rocks that roll across the tracks blocking them
You remember thedynamiteyou saw in the train's toolbox and get out to get some of it
You place a few sticks on the rocks and use your lighter on it
With the track cleared you proceed a short distance to a dead end
You get off the train and find a door which you can't open
You see some steam pipes and think that the steam is probably turned off somewhere
So you remember the looks of the pipes to possibly identify them on the other end and return to the train
Again you return the train to the turntable
You get off the train at the turntable and go to a control you noticed earlier next to one of the four gearboxes
When you find it you open it and turn a small crank one turn clockwise
As you suspected it rotates the turntable
But since it only turned degrees you do it again to turn the train so it's headed south
Back in the train you start traveling south retracing in reverse the route you took earlier
You pass a pair of sidetracks close together and awhile later you come to a third one
This time you operate the switch when the red light comes on and take the siding to the right
When the train stops at a barricade you get out to explore the area
You hear some type of machinery operating and as you get closer you see that it is a conveyor belt system moving small rocks to what looks like a crusher
And there is baby Amanda at the controls
You check the two controls you see in front of Amanda each is supplied by a separate steam pipe
The one on the left seems to have steam in its pipe because its gauge rises when the valve wheel is turned on
And when you move that control lever you hear somethingclank
Your curiousity aroused you get the umbrella you've been carrying in inventory and after a few timing failures manage to stick it in the hole above one of the conveyor's doors while it's open
Crawling into the open doorway you can see the tracks in the next tunnel over the tracks with the gate blocking them
You go operate the control lever again and come back and verify that it does control that gate and that with the lever pushed the gate stays open
You retrieve your umbrella thinking that it might come in handy again
You try the other control but to no avail there's no steam in that pipe
Disappointed that you cannot rescue Amanda at this time you make a mental note of that pipe's appearance and go back to the train
You back the train to the switch and far enough beyond it that it is almost out of sight
Then you travel forward again taking the left track at the switch and stopping when you reach the turntable
Now that you know the gate is open you want to go on that track again
So you turn the turntable to the north and follow that track to its end
What you find makes you think you have journeyed to the volcano's core steam is being generated by the heat of molten lava
You find a row of valves in front of the steam boilers and look for pipe styles that match those you noted earlier
You find the pipe on the far right looks like the one at the door you couldn't open so you turn it to the left to open it
Then you open the third one from the left since it looks like the one in the rock crusher room
Testing the other valves you find them all open except the fourth from the left
You hesitate to open it not knowing what it does
You turn to the right to explore the lava pit in the next room and notice a map on the wall by the doorway
Studying the map you learn that the steam pipe with the closed valve supplies power to another door
So you go back and open it by turning it to the left
Returning to the lava pit you go to the end of the walk way and carefully peer over the edge
You see an elevator car suspended from a cable but part way down in the pit
Looking around you see a control panel a short distance to the right but the walk way has parted and one section is left hanging
You click on the hanging section to get a close up view and then snag it with your handy umbrella
While holding it up in this manner you latch a small hook near the right edge of the walk way to keep it in place
You move a lever on the control panel and the elevator car moves to the top
You get in the car and bravely depress the control to descend
You watch a video clip of the car starting to descend while turning degrees to position a viewing window and some type of implement toward a wall that has some pipes attached
When the video ends you move the car the rest of the way to the bottom and discover a heat resistant metal sphere
It is obvious to you that you must manipulate the valves you saw using another robotic arm to cause this sphere to open
This is perhaps the most difficult task in this game
This arm seems harder to control than the one in the mini sub
The horizontal arrow keys on the keyboard will move the arm horizontally the vertical arrow keys operate the car's control
You can also use the mouse and cursor to operate these controls
You must click on the arm's joy stick control to extend the arm
The knob next to the joy stick rotates the end of the arm The task is to turn four of the six arrow shaped valves from the vertical to the horizontal position
They don't all turn the same direction
Tracing the pipes up from the sphere will give you a clue to which ones to turn escaping steam indicates a wrong choice
Counting from the top down turn and
Strangely the valves seem to turn in the opposite direction from the end of the arm
And sometimes the valve doesn't turn even though the light is on indicating that it should Before leaving the lava pit you must put all valves back to their original position with the arrows vertical
Otherwise there won't be sufficient steam to hold that gate open and you'll be stuck here
The task is to turn four of the six arrow shaped valves from the vertical to the horizontal position

Before leaving the lava pit you must put all valves back to their original position with the arrows vertical
Otherwise there won't be sufficient steam to hold that gate open and you'll be stuck here
When you have the valves positioned to open the sphere you descend to the bottom
Extending the arm into the open sphere you find you must raise the car slightly to reach theweapon pieceinside
You then start your ascent stopping to reset the valves to their original state
That done you continue upward
The car stops before reaching the top and you push the control upward again to initiate the video clip of the final ascent
Having collected your prize you scurry out of this inferno and back to the train
Remembering the map you just saw you have no trouble finding your way back to Amanda
Now when you turn the right valve handle in front of Amanda the gauge rises
You pull the control handle and turn to see an electromagnetic hoist move over the conveyor belt at the far end
You've noticed that every third rock moving along the conveyor is a tad bigger and is light brown in color indicating that it is iron ore which is magnetic
Now you notice that each time the crusher behind Amanda comes down on one of these another one is under the magnet
So you watch for the next piece of iron ore to enter the crusher
Then you push the button next to the control lever just as Amanda begins to lower her left arm to move the conveyor
Now you push the control lever to move the magnet with the piece of iron ore toward you pushing it again you move it over a lever beside Amanda's cage
You drop the rock by pushing the button again and Amanda drops from her seat and moves out of sight
You do your umbrella trick on the conveyor door again only this time you must open the door yourself
You crawl in and getAmanda
You are a tad loath to put Amanda in your inventory bag but you don't have much choice
Boarding the train again you take it to the turntable where you turn it to face east
You proceed eastward passing the siding going to the rock crusher and watch for the red light to come on as you approach the first switch of that double intersection
But it doesn't come on so you stop at the switch to try to fix it
Getting out of the train you find ahex barin a box by the switch machine
You place the hex bar into the switch machine and go to the train to look in its tool box
Finding awrenchthere you take it to the switch machine and use it on the hex bar
You back the train a ways down the track then come back forward trying the red light again this time it works and you continue to explore that sidetrack
A short while later you are stopped by an open drawbridge what's more the draw is on the other side
You get out and look to see how it might be lowered from this side
You finally find a lever located below track level but now you're faced with the problem of how to reach it
Finally you remember the winch on the back of the train and head for the turntable to turn it around
On the way back you find it a mite tricky operating the switch while going backward but after a couple misses you get the knack of it
When you get out of the train at the bridge the winch controls go with you
You lower the hook and when you raise it again it catches the lever and lowers the drawbridge
Having a desire to see where you're going you go to the turntable again to turn around
You've already had to fix a switch and lower an open drawbridge on this siding so you proceed cautiously expecting to find more difficulties
Good spot to save your game
Sure enough you haven't gone far beyond the bridge when you see a broken rail up ahead and stop the train barely in time
Looking in the train's toolbox again you take the onlytoolavailable
Clicking on the track to get a close up view you use the tool to pull the spikes holding the broken rail down and remove the rail
You see a section of abandoned track over to the left and go to it
You use the tool again to remove a piece of rail there and take it to repair the broken track
Back in the train you continue uneventfully to the end of the track
You remember from looking at the map that the room where you would like to be is on the other side of that wall directly ahead of you
You decide to try the auger on the front of the train
You click on the control in the middle of the control panel and watch a video clip of the auger in action
And then you proceed through the hole into the workshop and move to the workbench where you will build the vacuum cannon
You should have the assembly drawing and six of the weapon pieces by now and be ready to put it together
Click on the stock in the vise to get the assembly screen
You can turn the pieces to facilitate assembly a rear view of the weapon seems to work for most pieces Part from the desk at Martin's Roost
Click this part in inventory to move it to the work area
Align it with its rear to the left Part from the lava pit at Dark Domain
Drag this part to the stock in the work area to swap places with it
Align this part so the metal tip on the front connects with part
Then turn the assembly with its rear toward you Part from the shipwreck
Click it in inventory to bring it to the work area
Turn the part so its rear is toward you and click it on the assembly to connect them Part from the Island Fortress
Bring it to the work area and click the flaps to spread them
Align it with the end having the largest hollow facing forward
Click it under part so it connects with the assembly Part from the temple
Bring it to the work area and click one of the tubes to spread them
Align it with the tubes forward
Click it on the rear of part to connect them Stock from the vise
Bring it to the work area and align it with its rear toward you
Click it on the rear of the assembly to connect it
Rotate the assembly to a side view and click 's flaps and 's tubes to close them Part from the puzzle box at the lighthouse
Bring it to the work area
Click the forward piece on the lid of part to raise it then click the rear piece to slide it forward
Now click the lid itself to open it
Turn the little bottle so its mouth is forward and drop it inside
Close the lid and extend the pieces on top A light on the weapon comes on to let you know it's ready
Click the exit button to leave the assembly screen
This is a good place to save your game
The ending which follows is the best of several the manual claims different endings
You may want to return here to try some of them including using the door you found earlier into Dark Being's lab
You step back from the workbench and do an about face to face the entrance to the lab
You find a steel door similar to the one you found earlier but this one opens when you click on it
As the door opens you see Dark Being moving across the room
You take one step into the doorway to watch better without being seen
You get the cannon from inventory and watch Dark Being as he prepares to open the portal
You see him moving from left to right as he Installs a power modulator tube in the machine Turns a wheel or times Pulls a long floor mounted lever Pulls a shorter lever Turns a crank several times Moves to pull another floor mounted lever but you capture him with the cannon before he moves it
Actually you can capture Dark Being at any point during the above procedure but the more of it you let him do the less you will have to do when you want the portal open
On the other hand if you let Dark Being complete the procedure and open the portal he escapes from you
If this happens push that last lever back to its original position to close the portal and return to the train
When you come back to the lab Dark Being will be opening the portal again
Or you can continue without capturing Dark Being one of the alternate endings
With Dark Being out of the way you explore the lab finding Dr Krick lying on a trance inducing machine
You go to the machine and move a lever on the left to place an electrode on Dr Krick's head
You see two switches next to the lever and operate the one on the right
Then you set the knob to the second mark from the top
You then operate the lever on the right three times to bring Dr Krick out of his trance
He complains of a headache but you figure that will wear off and you push the lever that opens the portal
Now when you click on Dr Krick he says he can't leave without Amanda
So you get Amanda out of inventory and click her on him to show him
He then asks about his blueprints
You spot a strongbox under a table that might contain them only it's locked
You head for the train to get a tool
As you reach for therock hammer you spot the dynamite and decide to build a bomb
You click on the dynamite if some goes to inventory click again on what's left in the toolbox to get a close up view
Now you get the circuit board and alarm clock from inventory and add first the circuit board and then the clock to the dynamite
You have a time bomb
And only one hour to go
You hurry back to the lab and click on the strongbox to get a close up view
You attack it with the rock hammer and open it to get theblueprints
When you show the blueprints to Dr Krick he gets up and steps through the portal
You follow with Amanda and the blueprints still in your inventory
You all meet in front of the fireplace in the lighthouse den
Dr Krick thanks you and as a finishing touch asks you to throw the bottled Dark Being into the sea

LITTLE BIG ADVENTURE Relentless Twinsen's Adventure Solution by Phil Darke In LBA you play the part of Twinsen
Your mission is to save the planet from the evil Dr Funfrock
Before you start playing there are a few things you need to know
The game itself is excellent
Graphics and sound are very good and the gameplay is first class
However it is very hard and some parts will take a long time to complete
This solution is only a guide and there may well be other ways to solve a particular problem
One of the principal weapons in the game is a magic ball and most of the characters require at least three hits from the magic ball to kill them
In order to achieve a hit you need to be positioned exactly right and you may well have to try several times
In addition the target will almost certainly move after the first hit so you should try to position yourself so that in order to attack they have to move directly toward you in a straight line in order to score more hits
The other peculiarity of this game is that there is no save game option
Instead the game is automatically saved at what the manual refers to as ldquo INVISIBLE MILESTONES rdquo
This works fine except that you only have one saved game unless you start again from scratch and use a different name
This means however that since there is no indication of where these so called Milestones are you cannot backtrack to an earlier position if you make a mistake
There is one advantage to this save game arrangement which is that each time you get killed your inventory is saved so that any items you collected since the last save are added to what was already there
This means that by going through a particular part of the game several times and getting deliberately killed you can increase the items in your inventory
I did this and accumulated over Kashes money in the first part of the game which came in particularly useful later
Scattered through the game are a number of Lucky Clovers
These can restore your health and magic to maximum but only if they are held in the Clover boxes of which there are four in various places throughout the game
So a magic clover in a box is effectively an extra life
You start the game with no clovers and no boxes so if you get killed before you have collected both of these items it is game over and restore a saved game
When you visit Proxima Island for the first time about half way through the game you can get a note giving the locations of some of the Clover leaves and boxes
The note reads Locations of several clover leaves and boxes There is a box for clover leaves in the sewers of Citadel Island and another in the basement of the Tavern One clover leaf is guarded by a soldier who is located behind sandbags
Another is guarded by a clone in the ruins on Principal Island
Another one is on the roof of the Maritime Museum
Another is guarded by a Groboclone to the right of the Teleportation Centre rsquo s entrance Another is guarded by a soldier in front of Funfrocks fortress
Not mentioned in the note is a box on the Island to the south of Peg Leg street on Principal Island but you can rsquo t get there until after your first visit to Proxima Island
There are also clover leaves in the water tower and in the Temple of Bu in the White Leaf Desert
Also you need to investigate every container flower pots rubbish bins rubbish pile and cupboard you come across to find useful items such as money health points and magic flasks
If you get killed and restore a saved game check them all again as they will have items in them not necessarily the same as the first time you looked
THE CITADEL You begin in a cell in the asylum
F Change to aggressive mode and pace up and down
When the nurse comes to investigate kill him and jump onto the platform
As soon as it stops jump off and kill the nurse on the left before he presses the alarm button
Now kill the doctor and take the key
Go down the steps and through the gate to the left
Wait until the nurse walks up the screen past you then go around the corner and attack him before he can press the button
Go through the door at the top right and search the locker to get your ID card and Holomap
Go behind the screen at the top left and take the nurses uniform
Go to the bottom left and up the stair
Go through the entrance to the right and kill the nurse and the doctor and take the key

steps to the north straight ahead until he reaches the metal garbage can steps to the east to his right until he arrives at alight post
He must stand EXACTLY between the two lamp posts and then take steps to the north until he arrives at a gate
Captain LeBorgnes treasure is behind the gate
Now go to the barracks to where you found the buggy
Use the buggy and go to Port LaBooga
Talk to the fisherman but he won rsquo t help you
Go and talk to the spheroid he will offer to sell you his catamaran for Kashes
Buy the boat and head for Proxima Island
PROXIMA ISLAND The instructions you got from the library lead you to the museum but you need a red card to get in
Wander around until you meet a salesman
Buy a hair dryer from him
You should also meet a Sphero who gives you coffee pot
Buy a museum ticket from the rabbibunny next to the museum entrance
Go to the room next to the sleeping sentry
Talk to the elephant in here and he will tell you about the alarms in the museum
Go back to the dock and to the left
Enter the inventors house give him the hair dryer and he will give you a jet pack
Leave and go to the house nearby
Talk to the elephant here and return the coffee pot to him
Talk to him again and he will give you a key pad
Leave and go down the steps to your right
Try to enter the house and a guard appears
Kill him with the magic ball and take the key that he drops
Enter the house and talk to the rabbit
He tells you about his brother who is imprisoned on Principal Island for forging red cards
He promises to give you a red card if you will go and talk to his brother
So go to the docks and head for Principal Island
Go and talk to the rabbit who is imprisoned in the cell under the machine gun post on the road leading to the library
When he has given you the information you need return to Proxima and get your red card
You can now enter the museum so go in and have a good look around noting the locations of the Pirate flag and the treasure chest
If you are spotted by the clone in here you will be thrown in jail
If so then go to the bottom right corner of the cell
There is a lift here which will take you down to the sewers
Walk to the left and jump across the gap with the two boards and onto the grate
Attack the nurse and go down the steps to the locker to get all your belongings back
Now leave and return to the museum
When you have seen all you need to see in the museum exit via the grate this brings you out in the jail near the locker
Go up the steps and set off the alarm
Kill the nurse and return to the museum via the sewers
When you come up in the museum use the jet pack
Remember what you were told earlier about the museum rsquo s alarms
Don rsquo t touch the floor and if you see the robot guard keep still
Go and get the pirate flag and then go to the treasure chest and take the key
Exit the museum and return to Citadel Island
Go to the cave under your house and use the key
Enter and read the plaques and take the Medallion and the Horn
Use the horn on the S symbol on the wall to receive five clovers
You now have the third level of magic and access to new places
Exit the cave and return to the Catamaran and select Rebellion Island as your destination
REVOLUTION Before setting sail for Rebellion Island use the Pirate Flag on the catamaran otherwise when you arrive you will be shot up and not allowed to land
Go to the right and talk to the soldier under the cam nets
He tells you to go and talk to their leader who is several miles away and allows you to use his buggy to go there
Talk to the sphero who asks you to rescue their leader Colonel Krompton who is held captive in a fortress in the mountains a commando has been allocated to go with you and help you
Return to the dock and talk to the commando
Get into the landing craft and off you go
As soon as you arrive head up the slope and kill any guards you encounter
Any who are too hard will be finished off by the commando
When you reach the top of the slope go left and climb onto the top of the buildings and go back to your right and destroy the radio transmitter
Now head north and aided by the commando kill as many as possible of the soldiers you encounter
About half way up you find a tank
The commando suggests that you use this so enter the tank and carry on and enter the fortress
From here you are on your own
It took me quite a few attempts until I realised that the clones and soldiers here are pretty stupid and will only attack you if you get too close
If you do get killed in here you get re incarnated at the bottom of the slope and the tank and the commando remain in the fortress
The soldiers guarding the path back up to the fortress are quite hard to kill
So it is probably easier to go into athletic mode and make a mad dash past them taking care to avoid the mines
The only one you can not get past in this way is the machine gunner guarding the bridge but he is not too much of a problem and will only shoot if you approach head on
So walk right and onto the parapet of the bridge and throw your ball from here
Run left and around the back of the pill box and back into the fortress
Kill the first soldier you encounter then go left and walk up the stairs to a point about two thirds of the way up turn half right and from here you have a reasonably good chance of hitting the clone with your ball
Use the same tactic on the second clone
Pick up the key and carry on up the stairs killing two guards on the way and taking the keys which they drop
At the top go to your right and down
Here there is another clone and a scientist
Wait slightly to the left of the bottom of the steps and from here you can the clone with your ball as he comes into view
This may take a little time but with patience can be done fairly easily Follow the right wall around behind the desk and stand in front of the locker facing left
From here you can get a good shot of the scientist as he comes around the corner
Carry on up the stairs and through the door
Kill the sphero here and take his key
Carry on to you right and release the Colonel from his cell
Now carry on to your right kill the last sphero and exit via the small hatch
Walk off screen into the snow
When you recover you find yourself at the top of a mountain with a ski board
Ski down the slope if you enjoyed this and fancy another go just enter the ski lift
Talk to the rabbit at the ski lift and head off screen to the right
The villagers are being terrorised by mutants
Kill as many mutants as you can and talk to everyone
They will offer to open the exit leading back to the port for you if you can destroy the mutants
Follow the girl rabbit
Who digs a hole for you to enter
Kill the two guards and the red clone guarding the entrance
Take the key that he drops and enter
Kill the scientist near the entrance and take his key
Now head north and west and release the elf from the cell
He tells you that you can get a blue card from the White Leaf desert go back to the entrance and talk to the green sphero
He will operate the shuttle for you
When you exit the shuttle turn right and go and kill the scientist before he has chance to sound the alarm
Continue to your right and kill the clone at the top of the stairs
Go up the steps and turn right at the top
Kill the mutants on the tables and the scientist
Walk to the left of the room and the go north
Here you find a tank with some eggs in it
Kill these when you rsquo ve got them all the screen will flash red
Go back the way you came and then head north to the control room
Kill the scientist
Pull the left lever as Twinsen is looking at them once and then pull the middle lever once
Exit the control room and jump off the ledge by the barrel
There is another mutant here and you need to be pretty quick to avoid him
Run up and left and through the door
Run down to the right and into the shuttle and from there back the way you came through the hole back to the cauldron
The rabbit here will now open up the exit via the Sacred Carrot
Go down and left until you meet a guard by a locked gate kill him and the three other guards and head up and to your right until you come to another locked gate
You can do no more here as you need a blue card to open it
So retrace your steps back to the rabbit village and down the hole
Walk along the ledge to the left and kill the machine gunner
Jump off the ledge and exit to the left
Run along the shore avoiding or killing the guards that you meet
Keep going until you find your Catamaran
WHITE LEAF DESERT Set sail for the white leaf desert and on arrival go to the top right corner of the desert and use the horn on the S symbol
This opens an entrance into a maze
Talk to Joe the elf and he will give you a blue card
Return to the catamaran and set sail for Proxima Island
When you arrive head right past the museum and left at the end
There is a buggy here guarded by a clone
Kill the clone and use the buggy to go to the marked stone
Use the horn on the S symbol and go up to the stone
You will be told that the password for the Eclipse stone is GIZMO and asked for the password which will free it
At this stage you do not know
So head back to Proximacity
From where the buggy drops you go south to a square where there is a gun and a motor cycle
The gun rotates anti clockwise so to avoid being shot wait until it has passed you then follow it around to get to the bike
Go to the Eclipse stone and use the password GIZMO on it you will receive a flute and the password for the marked stone BURBS
Return to the marked stone and use the password
Your health and magic will be restored to maximum
Go back to the catamaran and head for the Hamalayi mountains
Walk right along the coast to the outside of the factory compound
Kill the sentry and take his key
Run through the gate and up onto the ledge and down through the hole go back to the village and through the entrance under the sacred carrot
Go left and kill the sentry
Take his key and enter the compound
Kill the sentry on the steps and go up and kill the other two use the blue card to go through the gate and then kill two more sentries to obtain a key
Go to the bottom of the screen and down to the quayside
Open the gate and kill the red grobo go left and left again at the end this will take you to the Clear Water Lake
Use the magic flute to melt the ice and fill your flask with clear water
You have now received the fourth level of magic
Return to the quayside and use the boat
TIPPETT ISLAND On arrival talk to the character by the side of the water
He tells you that you need a Dino Fly to go to Fortress Island orPolar Island
Go into the shop and stock up
Next go and talk tothe fisherman he gives you a key
Talk to the guy in white trouserswho will sell you information
Ask about the teleportation centre You learn that it is located on Brundle Island and that you canget in by acting like one of them
Also ask about the cloningcentre which is located inside Dr Funfrock rsquo s H Q
on Fortress Island
Now go right and up to a locked gate
This is the entrance to the Twinsun bar
Walk through the door and up the steps
Just before you reach the top of the steps change to athletic mode and run past the bouncers
Go into the bar and talk to the rabbit on stage
Use the boat to go back to the Hamalyi mountains and from there go back to your Catamaran
WHITE LEAF DESERT Go into the desert and talk to the old man by the well
He will trade the magic flute for a guitar
Now return to Tippett Island
TIPPETT ISLAND Go back to the bar and give the guitar to the guy on stage
Now go and talk to the barman who will open a passage way for you
Drop down and use your jet pack to get onto the back of the crab
When you get to the opposite steps jump off and go up the wall bars to a ledge
Jump down the hole to get a key to the gate
Climb back up and go through the gate
Use athletic mode to jump up the pile of rubble and climb onto the top
Run across avoiding the snakes and climb up
At the top you find a Dino Fly
Talk to him and ask him to take you to Fortress Island
FORTRESS ISLAND Talk to the rabbit and ask him to help you get into the fortress
He says that they can dig a tunnel to get you in but wants you to destroy the teleportation centre first
He also needs the plans for the fortress before he can dig
Go back to the Dino fly and ask him to take you to the Himalayi mountains then go back to the hover boat
TIPPETT ISLAND Talk to the green grobo near where the boat drops you and ask about the plans
For kashes he tells you that the plans are in Dr Funfrocks safe in his H Q
on Principal Island
Get the hover boat to take you back to the Himalayi mountains and from here go to the catamaran
PRINCIPAL ISLAND
When you arrive use the buggy to go to the military camp and from there to Peg Leg street
Walk down to the waters edge to the north of the broken bridge is a ramp leading into the water
Use the jet pack and cross the water to the island
Here you will find another clover box
Each time you pass the elf on the ledge near the mutant factory you will receive three lucky clovers
You can do this as many times as you like
So it is a good idea if you are expecting some heavy action to go and stock up
From Peg Leg street go to the east west road where the tank is
Just to the right of where the tank is parked is a guard behind barbed wire
Kill the guard and jump over the wire
Talk to the elephant in the cell then climb the ladder
Go up the steps and use the red card to open the gate inside the gate are two red grobos they are very hard to kill and took me some time
Once you have killed the two grobos use the blue card on the other gate
If you position yourself carefully by the steps you can hit the green clone here with your magic ball without getting hit yourself
A grobo now appears and when you have killed him he drops a key
Pick up the key and enter the fortress
At the top of the stairs is a scientist
You probably will not have time to reach him before he sounds the alarm
Kill him and a green grobo appears kill him too
and go down the steps and east there is another scientist here
Kill him for the key to the cell
Talk to the rabbit and he will show you a secret passage out of there but you are not ready to leave yet
Go back up the way you came and down the steps to the west
This is Dr Funfrocks office and he is here with a green grobo
When he sees you he will kill the grobo and teleport out of there
Open the nearby cell and talk to the elephant
He gives you the safe key
Go and open the safe and take the sabre
There is also a note here from the architect
He has taken the plans home to Citadel Island
On the right of the road leading up to the library is a gate
If you go in here the place is guarded by four clones
To kill them go south and jump over the stones bordering the grass
From here you can throw your magic ball while staying out of range of their fire
When killed each one drops a clover leaf but you need to be pretty quick to grab them without getting hit
Walk to the right and you find an S symbol
Use the horn and you can replenish your magic to maximum
CITADEL ISLAND Go to the house to the right of your house
This is where the architect lives
Ask him about the plans
He will give you his pass which is on the table
Now head for the teleportation centreon Brundle Island
So go to the Himalayi mountains to where youleft the Dino Fly
BRUNDLE ISLAND Go north to the guard post
Show the pass you got from the architect
Walk through the gate and to the left
Climb the ladder and walk across the roof to the white paint on the wall
Use the horn and jump through the hole
Go right and kill the grobo on the platform to get a key
There is a scientist on a lower level behind some railings
You can kill him with your magic ball by throwing over the railings
Go up the stairs and kill the clone here
Exit via the stairs in the bottom right corner then go up
Use the action key on the barrel to get a key
Open the door and run through
Run past the clone and kill the scientist
If you do not kill him first he calls more clones
Kill the clone then use the sabre to destroy the teleports
Go back up and turn right to where there is another scientist
Use your magic ball to kill him and destroy the computer
Now exit by the hole in the wall near Dr Funfrock rsquo s statue
FORTRESS ISLAND When you arrive talk to the rabbit and he will agree to dig a tunnel for you but you must kill the guards and destroy the tank first
Do this with the magic ball and then enter the tunnel
Walk to the back of the room jumping the ledges
As you get near the hole in the floor near the back of the room a large orange monster appears from the hole
He is very difficult to kill but it can be done
At this stage you will probably be very low on energy and have used up most of your clover leaves
If you get deliberately killed until you get the game over message
Then when you restore the game you will be back outside the building and you can go back to the Dino Fly and return to the elf on the ledge in the Himalayi mountains to replenish your supply of clover leaves before going to see him get killed by jumping in the water
You will then be re incarnated with energy and magic levels at a maximum and can then return to Fortress Island and re enter the Fortress in safety
Back inside the fortress go to the mushroom in the top left corner to get a key
Go through the gate and kill another three clones
Climb the ladder and kill the guard to get the key to the cell in which Zoe is held
When you release her you find it is not Zoe but a clone and you are captured and thrown in a cell like the one at the start of the game and you can get out of it in exactly the same way
Kill the Zoe clone and take the key
Get your belongings from the locker and go through the exit to your left
Here there is a room full of clones
Ignore them and use the horn on the S symbol on the wall
Go through the hole that is created and walk up to the stone of the Septentrion
You learn that the Well Of Sendell is located at the top of a rocky peak on Polar Island
Use the flask of clear water on the stone
The Fortress is destroyed and you are now in the ruins
At this point it is probably a good idea to go and visit your friendly elf to get some more clover leaves Head north through the ruins and into the construction site
Kill the first workman you meet to get a key
Go Through the gate and avoid the vehicles and either kill or avoid the workmen
In the North west corner you meet a green grobo
Talk to him and he will let you use the bulldozer
The bulldozer is located north west of where you got the key
When you use it it will automatically follow a path to where there are boulders blocking the road
The bulldozer will move them
If you retrace your path a few steps from where the boulders were you will encounter a clone
Kill him to get five clover leaves
Continue up the path following the tyre tracks
Keep going until you encounter a bulldozer this one is fairly easy to get by
Simply run up the slope and jump onto the wooden blocks and from there onto the track
The second bulldozer is a bit harder and you just have to run past it without getting caught
Continue down and kill the workman to get a key
Go south east to a gate guarded by another workman
Kill him and go through the gate
THE WELL OF SENDELL The well is situated at the top of the rocks and is guarded by three workmen
The first workman is out of sight on the bottom left corner of the rocks and waits until you have gone past before attacking by which time you will also be attacked by the second workman
To avoid this walk to the first corner and go into discrete mode
In this mode you lob rather than throw the magic ball and it can reach higher
So from here you will be able to kill the first workman in safety even though you can rsquo t see him
Continue along the path in discrete mode and attack the second workman
Go round the corner and kill the third workman
Select the sabre from your inventory and go into aggressive mode
Climb the ladder which although difficult to see is situated just to the right of the bottom right corner
When you reach the top of the rocks you find Dr Funfrock and Zoe
Immediately attack Dr Funfrock and push him off the edge of the rocks
Walk to the S symbol and use the horn to break it
Enter the opening and go down to the bottom of the well
Jump on the grate and go down
Select the sabre and go into aggressive mode
As you walk towards the exit Dr Funfrock re appears
Attack and kill him
Now walk through the exit and sit back and watch the end sequence

Now for the Inventory there may be a few blanks and I cant find find places for the Car Part Gallic Acid Pyramid Key or the Burgermasters Key

WALKTHROUGH AND STORY WARNING DO NOT READ AHEAD IF YOU WISH TO FINISH THE GAME WITHOUT HELP
This is how I finished the game but it is possible to switch the order of some of the puzzles and these are only what you must do to complete the game there are MANY other cool things you can do as well You start in your house on Citadel Island and Zo has just told you that your Dinofly is hurt
Search the cupboard in the room to find a key
Go into the locked door and pick up the Magic Ball Holomap and darts hit the bulls eye and your receive Life points
Go outside and go to your neighbors house you will see a dirty map that you cant read he tells you to get a bottle of Gallic Acid from Desert Island for him
Leave his house and find Zo and Dinofly She will tell you to find a cure for Dinofly at the Chemist
Try to use you car to find out that you must get a part for your car from Baldino on Desert Island Now find the Pharmacy damn she doesn t have a cure but the little lady can help you
But first you must get her umbrella back for her
Creep up behind the thief in DESCREET mode and he will give you the umbrella give it to the lady to find out that the healer on Desert Island can help you out Now a hero cant go about without his Tunic Go to the museum and pay to enter
Go in and you will see your Tunic and Medalion in a force field
Go upstairs and you will see the controls to the force field but the door is locked
Now you should notice something
The window in this room is open
Run outside and Run up to the roof tops and enter the window
Now there are buttons use both and RUN downstairs and get your Tunic and Medalion you must run because the field is timed Go outside and talk to everyone until you find out that there is a weather wizard
Hmmm lets go find him At his tent he tells us that he cannot fix the weather because the lighthouse is locked
Go to the lighthouse to find out that Raph the keeper has gone missing when taking walks along the cliffs Travel to the north of the island and look for a snake outside a cave go in and follow the cave to the cliffs
Jump over the gaps and go into another cave
Inside will be a gate you cannot pass you must throw your magic ball at the lever behind the barrels
Now you can pass into the next room
Go in and run along the lower part of the dungeon jumping over the gaps until you find a ledge with a lever
In DESCREET mode throw your ball at the lever to open another door A LOT of people have mailed me about this part To get up the ladder you must be in SPORTY mode and jump up the centre of the ladder then just continue to hold the FORWARD button on the keyboard and you should climb up the ladder Talk to Joe and head on to the next room
Kill both the little furry critters to get keys use the keys on the locked doors and enter the next room
Here will be a BIG furry monster called quot Tralu quot
This guy is relatively easy to kill but my advice is to run around him taking shelter behind the rocks and throw your ball at him
Once the Tralu is dead get his key and free Raph
Keep going east until you meet Zo
Walk out of the dungeon with her
Walk to the lighthouse and watch as the wizard does his thing Now the weather is fine aliens have landed on the planet they seem fine look OK and they talk cool
But I don t trust them Now at least you can visit Desert Island
Go to the harbor and buy a ferry ticket to Desert Island When you land follow the docks into the town
Once there go to the healers house it should be on your holomap
Damn he ain t home but don t forget to pick up the black striped bottle of Gallic Acid on the back cupboard
Next head to Baldino's house it shouldn t be that hard to find
Talk to him and he will give you the car part
From gossiping with the locals you might have heard of a school of magic but no one knows where it is Go to the Hacienda the hotel and talk to the owner note the ladder behind him
I did this next part completely by accident Go into the women s sauna hehehe and then go back out the owner will tell you off
Go back to the ladder he was in front of and climb up it
Talk to the snake charmer on the roof he will tell you that the school of magic is in the cemetery
Look through the telescope at the cave and then leave Now you need at least Kashes to progress but it helps to have Kashes so you don t need to go searching for cash later in the game
Kashes is a lot but I know how to get that much quickly and easily
Head for the Temple Park was the temple of Bu and pay to enter
Once inside play the dart game its piss easy and win the balloons
Hmmm now your down the well get all the mushrooms you can
Each has Kashes for you
Repeat this until you get Kashes or Kashes if you don t want to trouble yourself later in the game Now your loaded head for the Cemetery
You will notice that the door wont open Look for a secret entrance between trees Go west from the main entrance and follow the hill until you see the trees
Once inside the door of the big face head north through a door
In here is a locked door and some blue ghosts
You can dodge the ghosts either ways
Watch the pattern in their movement and carefully maneuver your way through Climb up the stairs and jump on the tables jump from table to table until you pass the ghosts this doesn t work when coming back through
OK now you will see a chest but DO NOT run up to it creep up to it in DESCREET mode and get the key
Maneuver your way all the way back through and open the locked door
Continue through and talk to the headmaster wizard
He will let you join his school if you pay him Kashes
Pay up and he will assign you tests The Blowgun Test The Balsam Flower Test The Island of Dome and Slate
Now for the first test Go into the room behind the Headmaster and prepare yourself
In this room are moving targets you must hit them all within a time limit this test is quite tricky and takes a few turns to win
After you succeed see the Headmaster he will give you a cool blowgun for completing the test Now is the time to head back to Citadel Island and return the car part to Zo
Get a ferry ticket and head back home
Once on citadel Island give Zo the part she tells you that Baldino forgot to give you a portable radio and that she will call you when the car is ready
Buy another ferry ticket to Desert Island and go to Baldino's place he will give you a radio
You should now get a call telling you that Zo is waiting at the docks for you with your car
Get the car and if you like practice using it at the racetrack Now onto the second test you must find a flower in the desert
This test took me a while to complete Now how do you find the flower
OK go to the trees at the secret entrance to the School keep following the hill up until you find a place you can drive up
Once up keep driving until you come to a jump your car will make the jump and keep going until you get the flower
Go back to the School and speak to the headmaster you will receive a Horn of Healing for your efforts With this horn you can help you dino buddy get your last ferry ticket back to citadel island and go to your Dinofly blow the horn at him times and he will get up
Now get your Dino buddy to take you to the Island of Dome and Slate for the third test Once at the Island of Dome and Slate read the wooden card at the entrance and copy it ALL its boring takes ages so I am nice enough to sent you a screen shot if you email me
In the maze you can only see the square you are standing on and you must choose left right up down etc
It is difficult so prepare to die a few times
Once you complete the maze the Headmaster will give you a Slate which the game will automatically record maps and mazes onto
The Headmaster will also ask you to return to the school
Ride your Dinofly to Desert Island and take your car to the Cemetery enter the school and the Headmaster will give you your diploma and the second level of magic GREEN BALL
He will also tell you to find the flying wizard and get a wizard costume from him he also tells you of missing wizards and that you should try to find them
First find the flying wizard show him your diploma and buy the costume from him for Kashes
Go to the Hacienda and go into the room with the fountain The alien will talk to you thinking you are a wizard he will offer to take you to the wizards though I don t trust them I followed him into the men s sauna
SHIT
big mistake a whole alien base under the sauna it seems that they are taking you to their home planet Zeelich in a space ship
Pick up the translator the funny dome thing
And talk to the people in the space ship
Look at the tourist booth
When you have landed follow the guards like the alien says
Joe will see you and say hi the stupid elf got you put in prison
When you wake up Joe will come to your cell and tell you about the wizards and a plot to kidnap Twinsun's children
A guard will come and open the cell door
Bash him and run west until you see two levers only pull the bottom one
Don t exit the prison yet though Look for a cell with a Mosquibee run upstairs and pull the second lever you see he is now free
Go back to the first entrance you opened and talk to the Mosquibee
Go outside and kill the robot with your ball
Once you are out of the enclosure go around the back of the prison behind the dog kennels jump over the fence and run to the building opposite
In here you MUST take the left passage two guards will attack you so kill them and go down the lift
Go outside and you are at the spaceport run past or kill the two guards and go in the space ship
The ship wont take off because it doesn t have the orange cog like thing in the second terminal
Run outside and enter the tall building a control tower once inside kill both guards and run up the stairs
Up the top you will have to kill another guard and a scientist the white sausage guys grab the cog thing and head back down
Once outside head for the space ship again and use the cog at the second terminal
Now were off back home It looks like your flying skills need a little work but hey that s the least of your worries
You should now get a call from Zo
Its a bit late the children have been kidnapped and the aliens have taken over the Planet
Head to your house travel by the rooftops not by ground level and talk to Zo she tells you that Baldino wants you to meet him on the Emerald Moon and that he has left you a package at the baggage claim Head to the Baggage Claim and go inside
The grobo will let you in and open the door for you
In the next room is a suction thing and your parcel
Maneuver the suction machine over the parcel and then move the parcel into the lift
A door will open allowing you into the next room
You either have choices pay the man in here Kashes to move the parcel or figure out the puzzle yourself
I managed after hours of playing to work this puzzle out but I recommend paying the guy instead
Once you have worked this teaser out go upstairs and get the protopack Now you should go to the Weather Wizards Tent and read a piece of paper on the desk
Mmmm he needs a pearl lets go to Desert Island once their drive to the docks
Instead of going into town go the opposite direction keep running up until you arrive at a small jetty
Ring the bell and a turtle will offer you a lift
Accept and he will dump you in a cave
Inside is a HUGE clam shell you cant jump over the spikes but you can fly
Get the Incandescent Pearl and go back to the jetty If you have been gossiping around lately you might have heard about a Protection Spell
Do you remember seeing a small cave on an island when you looked in the telescope on top of the Hacienda
Get Dinofly to take you there
Once you have landed run down the path and fly into the cave
This part gets tricky you must dodge the bats and the fireballs
Find a place to land and jump over the spikes and kill to two skeletons
Here is another puzzle groan
See the passage above the right hand lift that s where we're headed
The point of this is to stack the crates on top of each other and get in the gap
A way to do this is to put the first box on the right hand elevator jump the pit of spikes to the left hand elevator go up and push the second box on top of the first box
jump down and use the lever for the right elevator
Jump the pit of spikes again use the left elevator go across and jump on top the two boxes
Simple really Now continue along the passage killing two more skeletons
Prepare yourself as you will be taking on a big demon
I found the easiest way to kill him was to charge him in AGRESSIVE mode when his back is turned and clobber him
Get the protection spell this spell kicks arse because you cant drown if you get hit when using the protopack
Since you cant get back the way you came you must take the water way turn on your protection spell and protopack your way back past the bats and the spikes and fireballs until you come out of the cave
Grab the Clover Box before continuing Now head for Citadel Island and go to the weather wizard s tent
Use the pearl in the caldron you now have a Lightening Spell
You must now go to your neighbors and use the Gallic Acid on his map
Cool you now have a map of the sewers and he gave you a special key
Talk to the locals and it will reveal info about quot Sendell's Ball quot being in the sewers
Head for the Tavern and kill all the enemies in there
Walk behind the Bar and look in a barrel for a key
Use the key and enter the Cellar
Follow the path down until you fall in a hole in the centre of the cellar make sure you have full mana before you enter the sewers
You are now in the centre of the sewers
Use the Pyramid key on the pad and it will open a door
Inside will be a big ice ball
Only the lightening spell can open it and lightening needs full mana
Once you get the ball you will have the third level of magic Red Ball Now it is time to find Baldino on the Emerald Moon your wife mentioned that the aliens are using the Temple Park as their Base
So that s where I headed
Go the Desert Island and make your way to the Temple Park
Say good bye to Twinsun because you wont see it again from now on
Enter the park you cant use the well as an entrance now but you can use the mineshaft
Go in and prepare yourself for ANOTHER puzzle more groans
If I explained how to do this it would take another or so pages so work this one out for yourself
Some hints for this puzzle are Shoot the arrows to change the carts direction
You must head down levels until you see a box protected by two fire ball shooting statues use the Protection Spell inside the box is a key
look for a ladder and a double door on the second middle level open the door with the key Now we are in the alien base
Turn left and kill the two sleeping guards search their stuff to find a key
Turn back and open the locked door
In the next room kill the guards and get a key from one of them
Open another locked door and you should see a Space Ship Darn
It doesn t have the ucking cog thing
Go north up the elevator killing guards as you go Now fly over the electric bridge leave it on after you are over it
Kill the guard in the next room and get the cog thing
More guards are at the other side of the bridge so turn it off and when they are on it turn it on again
Now they are fried turn the bridge off and run back across it to the Space Ship
Enter it use the key the cog thing and blast off When you land grab the blue space suit and answer the passcode as quot Operation Green Moon I think I know it was the bottom passcode quot I think
Go outside and talk to the guards they don t recognize you and will tell you to go to the Registration Booth
Go inside the building with the green light on the door you cant enter buildings with a red light
Inside you will have to take the spacesuit off with the space suit off the guards recognize you
Continue into the next room and kill the guards set all the switches to green so you can enter the base from where ever you like and copy look at the map on the wall it will automatically copy itself onto your slate
The map will tell you where Baldino is being held
My advice is to explore the entire map there is a clover box sitting around somewhere and then find Baldino once you free him his alien friend will get shot
He says go to Island CX Since there is nothing you can do to help follow Baldino out to the back exit put on your space suit and escape outa here Well we seem to be stuck on the alien planet we must now get some gas for Baldino and find Island CX
Jump to the shore and talk to the old sailor ask him about Island CX He charges you Zilitos to take you there
ZILITOS
now that is a lot
Head to the Casino we might make some money there
Pay the entry fee and play on the quot match the three things quot game dunno its proper name
Play this machine until you have Zilitos no more than eighty and you should get the key to the golden door
Go in and spin the wheel but prepare to kill the gameshow host and his mate I used protection spell
DO NOT go into the upper passage that opened up you do that later
You should now have Zilitos
Go out and visit the Twinsunian Souvenir Shop buy his Memory Reviewer allows you to see all the cutscenes you have viewed Now we can pay that sailor his money
Rip Off
he took me to damn Celebration Island well lets at least talk to the CX survivor while we are here
He tells us to find Mike's Gang and ask them to take me there
But before we speak to Mike lets go to the Island of Francos and get a couple of things that might be useful including the Gazogem Once on Francos Island every body is looking for some kinda Fragment
Lets find this fragment go to the Bazaar and buy a pickaxe
Now go to the day care and talk to the oldest kid there he tells us that he lost the key to the cupboard where clues to the Fragment are the fragment was taken by an owl
Go to the Burgermasters and look in the burrow to the right of his house
You should now have a key use it on the cupboard in the Burgermasters house and you will get a clue sheet
If you cant understand the clue sheet all you have to do is find the tree green colored face the bazaar where you bought the pickaxe be in SPORTY mode run forward about steps turn around and dig with the pickaxe you should be facing the green tree and standing on a patch of grass next to the sea Now onto getting the Gasogem run to the fence it seems there is no way over but there is
Go to the place with the pipes jump on the lower pipe and then onto a dent in the fence
You are now in the enclosure
Go into the closest building you are now in the gas refinery
Inside here you must pull or shoot levers that turn off the gas sprayers completely or for a limited time
Again I could tell you how exactly to do it but it would take pages to explain
It ain't that hard to work out but it does take a while my advice is to just put on your protection spell and run through
There is also a stage where there is no key to a door with dogs in it you must shoot a scientist over the gap and pick up the key with your ball
Once you have the gas exit and jump off the verandah onto a tap thing and then onto the fence and then you are back in the Knarta's hometown Now lets get a crystal that we will need very soon Go to Celebration Island and climb to the top
Now if you look to the northeast you will see a ladder
Fly across to it using protection and climb down the ladder
Use the pickaxe on the crystals and you now have the green crystal fly back across the lava and head back to Otringal to find Mike Now you should give the Gazogem to Baldino you will receive the super fast JETpack
While we are here we should also be thinking about seeing Mike at his bar go into the building with a dragon on the wall
Now you are inside you have options kill al the sailor guys and get a key to Mikes room or going past the freak that looks like Marilon Manson and going into a door behind the curtains
If you choose the second one you will have to pull winches to open a window and push some pillars into a position where you can reach the window
Once you meet Mike he will tell you to see Jonny Rocket in his hotel on the upper part of this island To get to the Upperground you must have the JETpack which I hope you have
Go to the top of the slope above the port
At the top will be a wooden platform and a door you can t reach by jumping use the jetpack to hover over the water to the other bank not the door
The door is a back entrance to the Casino
Once on the next bank continue westward past the Machine Gunners to the top of the hill
Avoid the alien swordsmen and the Mansion they are guarding run into the other building you see
You are now in the Hotel the Bellboy wont let you in so kill him find Johnny Rocket he is reading next to the pool talk to him and follow him into his room
He cant take you to Island CX either but he gives you a Dissidents Ring that identifies you as a rebel and tells you to go to the Twinsunian Souvenir Shop Go all the way back the way you came you can get back across the waterfall by adjacently running and jumping to the wooden ledge
Go to the Souvenir Shop and use your ring near the owner
He will open a secret passage to the other rebels
Once downstairs talk to the other rebels the will send you to the Francos Elevator and give you a laserpistol you need a crystal to make it work But hey you already have it don t you Head for the docks and get the Taxi driver to take you to Francos Island
On the island head for the fence again jump over and head for the building you haven t entered yet
Kill the guards inside and you will see a lever puzzle with your Lasergun shoot the levers until they are in this order from left to right Up Down Up Down run through the now open doors to the harbor
Run to the Catamaran and you will sail to the Francos Elevator Now you are at the Elevator get your Lasergun and protection spell ready
Prepare to kill a huge armed talking Gorilla this guy is not really that hard
I even managed to kill him without protection and not lose a clover
Once he is dead say your prayers as you go down the elevator You are now in the Undergas at an island called Wannies
Kill the scientist and hit the switch with your ball to get out
Now run past the guards and across the land bridge
Run past the Building Co building and kill all the guards around the corner
This next part takes ages head into the mine on your right
In here are gems a Clover Box and a Fragment
You must at least pick up EVERY gem and the Fragment
Once you have all gems and the Fragment exit the mine and continue along the path northward
Keep going past the ferryman s dock and enter another cave in the big round hill In the cave keep going straight ahead until you see a man asking for a slice of tart
Go west here and then turn south don t exit the cave in here is a family of Wannies they will make you some tart after you have recovered from your delirium pick up the kids glove and then give the tart to the man that asked for it
He will give you a key to the Dark Monks Chapel
Go inside the chapel and talk to the old Wannie
He will tell you that you can get to CX by going to the Mosquibee s island
He will also send you to his maid
Go out of the chapel and head back to the tart eating Wannie go South and then East from his position and you should be at the Maids place
She will teach you the Song of the Ferryman
Exit the cave and head for the Ferryman platform
On the platform sing the Ferryman s song and pay him of your precious gems to take you to the Island of the Mosquibee s Once on the island pick up ALL the gems you can find I think
Now talk to the flying Mosquibee and he will take you to the Queen
Show her your ring of Dissidents
She will give you a test to pass
Inside the Arena are little brown balls
You must find a key in one of them the key is in one of the balls coming from the top hole on the right wall
With the key open the right hand door and you should get the weapon
The BlowTRON Mmm we seem to be under attack and the Queen is gone
Damn we still cant get to Island CX
Make your way through this maze of platforms
In the second scene there are two exits one with a rope and one is a hole in the wall
Go through the hole in the wall can continue along the path over the bridge
Climb up the ladder and ready that Glove you borrowed
The flying walrus will only die if you bounce his fireballs back at him it takes hits before he dies
Now you can get the Mosquibee s Fragment
Head all the way back to the Ferryman s Platform and sing the song
Pay him more gems to take you to Volcano Island On Volcano Island pick up every gem you can find and head up the island you will have to jump onto tiny platforms on the lava at a certain point it is difficult and takes many save games
Continue up the island until you find a cave
Inside is a clover box and some Mosquibee escapee s talk to them to find out that the Queen is being held captive in the Building Co at Wannies
Go all the way back to the Ferryman Platform and call him again
Get him to take you to Wannies When you arrive you must head for the Building Co
Inside kill the guards and make your way through the complex until you come to a door that you cannot pass
When you enter the next door shuts
I found a cheat for this part go in the doorway so the second door closes then face the open doorway and use a Nitro Meca Penguin
Mr Meca just walks straight through opening the other closed door allowing you to continue
Kill the guards in the next room and pull the lever opening the Queen s Cell
Run in and talk to her
She will give you the key to her secret passage to Island CX talking to her a second time reveals where the passage is hidden
Hmmm the keyhole is on her Throne
Exit the building and head for the Ferryman and pay him to take you to the Mosquibee s Island Now you MUST pick up every gem on this Island you only need more in the game
When you have four gems
Head for the Queens Throne it was empty but now it is protected by a kick ass boss
Use protection and charge the Goblin and its guards
Once they are dead use the key the Queen gave you
Walk through this suprisingly small passage to Island CX WE ARE FINALLY HERE
You are in a small enclosure kill all the guards and walk through the locked door into another similar enclosure
Again kill the guards and enter the door
Now we are inside there is a lake which you must jetpack across use protection or avoid the walrus and the sea serpent
Go into the next room and pull the lever on the north wall while avoiding the swordsmen
Go through the west room and use the elevator
You will finally meet the Emperor and ummm kill him
But he triggered the reactors on the Emerald Moon to run into Twinsun
Sendell will now contact you via Sendell s Ball and tell you to collect all four Fragments kill Dark Monk and head back to Polar Island to prevent the Emerald Moon from colliding with Twinsun
Before you leave grab the Emperors Sword a KICKASS weapon
Leave the island the way you came and head for the passage First lets find the Fragments you should have of the already
We have the Wannies Fragment the Mosquibee s Fragment and the Knartas Fragment which leaves only the Sups Fragment
The Sups live at Otringal so we have to go all the way back through the Undergas to the Elevator
We will start by going all the way back through the passage and the Mosquibee s Palace
Go down the rope exit making sure you have gems
Call the Ferryman for the last time and get him to take you to Wannies At Wannies head for the elevator killing or avoiding guards as you go
Enter the elevator using the right entrance kill the guard and scientist and flick the switch
At the top of the Francos Elevator take the catamaran to Francos Island
Go all the way back to the Knarta s hometown and catch the Taxi to Otringal At Otringal you must go to the Upper part of the island again
This time killing the Swordsmen outside the Emperors Palace
One of them has a key to the locked door go through the door and continue up the hill through anther door
You are now inside the palace
The palace is a maze of square rooms and you must somehow make your way to where the fragment is
In each room is a chest or an enemy holding a key to the next room
The path through is quite simple go upwards through the rooms as far as possible and then go left until you come to a room with large northward facing double doors
Go in this door and fight your way up to a statue
The statue will explode revealing another Boss he is piss easy to kill so you shouldn t need any advice
Get the last Fragment and make your way outa the palace following the path you took to get here though the enemies in the rooms are random I have always found the Stanley guy from Time Commando in the last room on your way back out We now have the forth level of magic FIREBALL and the full key
Head for Celebration Island Dark Monk supposably resurrected himself there
Climb up the mountain and enter the Temple
Use the full key in the centre of the room and walk outside
Now you will see a lengthy scene revealing who the Dark Monk really is I cant tell you find out for yourself After Dark Monk has finished his jabbering climb up the podiums that have now risen and jump onto the big book and jump up the arm You are now inside the statues head
Put your protection Spell on immediately and run through the room to the screens that are locking the Wizards up the correct combination from left to right is
Now you must run to the button near the trapped Wizards and press it
Cool now the Wizards are free and will blow a hole in the cage to allow you to continue
Now you will be levels down in the Statue and you will meet Dark Monk again
After he has finished threatening you don t move just jump on the elevator again
Now you are levels down This part is hard make sure you have full mana now
Run south down the passage and down the stairs There will be an elephant with a triple missile launcher use lightening to kill him
Grab his key and run back to the elevator go into the cage and kill both elephants now you can use the final elevator down to level four
Down here you must again kill another missile launching elephant and get its key Run through the cage and go HALFWAY down the stairs
SAVE here and continue down the stairs Here you will meet Dark Monk for the last time
Have a lightening spell ready and creep forward until both the guards and Dark Monk are on the screen
Use lightening and it will kill the guards and severely weaken Dark Monk now charge him and kill him it isnt that hard any more he will also have a clone of himself to kill just use protection Damn the children were cut loose but don t worry you cant save them anyway walk to the left towards the lava and watch the BRILLIANT end game cutscene Thank you again Adeline for the most wonderful experience I have ever had with my PC Hey even the credits are cool
And DO NOT think the LBA idea has worn thin it really rules and I am looking forward to another sequel

The Curious Tale of Capt
Benjamin Spooner Briggs A poem by Inferno Prologue The Dungeons Avast ye me hearties
While I spin a tale with no jestOf the mysterious journey of the Mary Celeste A brigantine ship bound from New York townto the shores of Italy where she was bearing down Yet Fate had his eye on this jewel of the seaHe picked out the Captain and eyed him with glee ldquo He will be my pawn in this game of life rdquo Then he spat as Fate swallowed his crew and his wife Then Destiny spoke and arose such a clatter ldquo You may use The Captain but not yon ship for that matter rdquo So the Celeste was at last found unmanned yet sea worthy still ldquo Nilmates will I take for my pawn rdquo his first name was Bill ldquo I rsquo ll grant ye the Captain but his soul remains mine rdquo Young Destiny said to his brother with that the elder did whine ldquo Enough of this nonsense we rsquo ll see rdquo Said Fate with an evil look ldquo He might keep his soul if he puts the Seal with the Book rdquo And so it doth start the tale of Benjamin BriggsPlucked from the ships railing its sails and its rigs rdquo He rsquo ll start in the dungeons let rsquo s see what he rsquo ll choose rdquo But Destiny smiled on Briggs and sent him some clues Briggs awoke the next day inside his cell quot Where am I quot asked the Captain quot Just outside of Hell quot The reply came from Arach who was not on the floorAnd he bid him get up and unlocked the cell door quot You are imprisoned by The Four quot Arach said a word to the wise But you are not alone you have helpTo sort the truth from the lies For a quot Spiritual Guide quot rides along with you my friend Heed well what they bid for they rsquo ll help you succeed in the end Then he placed his hand in his ear and pulled out a wormAnd gave it to Briggs who started to squirm So Briggs leaves his cell and walks on down the hallHe learns about Grunger the jailer of all He wanders the halls meets a ghost who just in a rageand soon happens by Billy Nilmates up in a cage Billy wrangles on and on about his captors and keepThe Captain does try but soon falls fast asleepYet when he wakes a damp torch he does findHe picks the thing up and backs out in kind Briggs meets up with Eddwho rsquo s a quot head quot of himselfYou may laugh when you spy him in spite of yourself Edd tells the Captain to leave he rsquo ll need a keyBut lsquo tis around the neck of this great lump that ye see Edd tells Briggs to make a quick quot Sleeping Draught quot Gives him a bottle now Briggs is feeling quite daft But still he goes off stepping quietly in motionAnd is now on a quest to create a nice Sleeping Potion They both decide since Grunger rsquo s not eatenTheir plan just cannot be beaten Perhaps the good Captain could spike his ldquo gruel rdquo So it rsquo s off to the kitchens but the cook is no fool She rsquo s Grunger rsquo s poor mum Aye that rsquo s just what she is She cooks up dead souls to make for his gruel But something is needed to complete her son rsquo s meala dead arm or a leg so find it with zeal Go to her larder where books are like her schoolYe rsquo ll soon find a note which shows her how to make gruela pot filled with fat which is a good source of fuelAnd another empty pot Briggs can use as sort of a tool Aye this empty jar Briggs will find is a ldquo snot pot rdquo But you rsquo ll find that it rsquo s empty But Grunger rsquo s nose it is not So fill it in close up it rsquo s the best that the Captain can doJeez Louise but this is a disgustingly bad sort of clue An arm for the pot
Did I really say that
Burn the ropes near the walland Billy Nilmates falls flatCollect the appendage and skull from where the cages sat Look to Cranny Faggot she rsquo s wise and she rsquo s greenBut the women of Limbo like their drink now betwixt and between So help Briggs make some tequila with water and worm An arm for the pot and a skull nice and firm Then ask for a sample and fill up the skullAdd the snot from the pot and the gruel now will mull Then it rsquo s off to the jailer to give this sick brew to EddThe key can be captured there rsquo s no more to be said So now with the key Briggs can finally get out Find the large Oaken Door which is locked and aboutAnd take heed and learn of what this level teachesYou're atChapter One and The Lower Reaches Chapter The Lower ReachesLook to the quot beds of endless rest quot The one on the left shows items for your behest The one on the right though it may be gravenHas bones for the hungry and an eye for the Raven The one on the left holds sailor type thingsA ship rsquo s wheel an eye patch a whistle which doesn rsquo t sing Still take them all so there'll be nothing to lack rdquo Take what ye will give nothing back rdquo Follow down the stair to The Keepers new lairWhere he rsquo ll offer The Captain gifts threeTake one at a time the effect is sublimeChoose the Spice first as Briggs gets it for free A ship's wheel and iron bar from a lose grateCombine these two then go back to the coffins to open a gateA friend you'll uncover and a quot gift quot from his backGive this to O'Negus or an entry you'll lack To open three doors might give you some pauseYet where there rsquo s a will there rsquo s a way Each dog gets a boneThen they rsquo ll leave Briggs aloneAs they back up the doors open and stay Send Briggs through Door One so he will have some funWith a coffin lid over some rotten boards Travel onward from there you rsquo ll find ldquo Bugsy rdquo somewhereThough his eyes are cut there were no swords Listen to ldquo Bugsy rsquo s rdquo tale and how he doth wailOf the attack of his pet The Woodgator Take the green bottle then push the stone faucet rsquo s throttleAdd the water and spice andI see all y rsquo all later Go back to the main door where the dogs were beforeAnd enter Door Three on the right Find Good Chief Blackhawk how his pet it doth squawkLike two pigs under a blanket held tight As David met Goliath create one special tool Remember what happened at the Valley of Elah For once Briggs has fixed it he know he rsquo s no fool And Blackhawk will call him ldquo a jolly good fella rdquo On the way to the place where this Raven doth perch A statue resides waiting the good Captain's lurch A container of gold the prize if his aim be true A liquid though thick will this vessel hold'Tis an obvious clue Look to the Ravens each a Siamese twinSave the Good Chief from their cawingAnd you'll find his good gracesBriggs soon will be in if he ceases this incessant jawing As Goliath before David so stands the Raven on highMake ready the quot I quot cannon Take aim let loose
Watch it fly A gift made of bones will be yours soon to shareFor soon Briggs will place The Woodgator there Now out of Door Three and back to Door OneDon rsquo t you wish that The Captain was programmed to run Follow the trail and sooner or later we rsquo ll come to the jailOf the Lonely Woodgator A rusty chain in need of lubricationWood that is ground for thegator rsquo smastication These you must find so go back bythedogs' mouthWalk down the stairs and then make Briggs go south Two urns will ye find of sawdust and oilOne Briggs can pick up but the other might spoilSo now use the gold cup the one Briggs did toilTake care so it won rsquo t spill onto the soil Now put these together combine asyewillAnd soon Briggs will find the cage easy to fill Look to the cage for a place for the food Or less a bite which could be quite rude And once it is caught asleep should it beAs the Captain is squeamish and well should he be So how should this sleep can the Captain incur A cover perchance But where to procure Look to the dark at bottom down left shall ye go And tear at the fabric and the beast won't be a foe The Captain you know is quite squeamish they sayWhen Creepies and Crawlies do pass his way So what have you found that might do the trickTo capture Bugsy rsquo s last grub and not make him sick Nothing I've Nothing
Is that what you cry Perhaps a trip to O'Negus will help you get by Use the bottle Billy gave you from the crack in his backBriggs soon will gain entry with nothing to lack Here at O rsquo Negus trade like for like Saffron for warrior a cute little tyke Then look to the back room for another glass jugSo Briggs won rsquo t be squeamish and pick up Bugsy rsquo s last bug But first he must use something strongto put ickle baby to sleep for Briggs will not touch itYet in glass it might keep So back to The Keeper change ldquo the Spice rdquo for ldquo the Drug rdquo Add cotton and glass to the mixtureThen catch that grub bug Then through Door Two How will Briggs doWhen he tries to pass by the Monster of Stone Give Briggs a brave soldier rsquo s heart or a warrior rsquo s part To pass by the monster and leave it alone Then once in Dreamland tucked fastly awayOn a sphere made of glass Briggs allows it to play Briggs needs the spear too Yet he rsquo s up to the taskBut what of the bug

It rsquo s changingTo Lord of the Flies Now take it once more in the glass jar shall it linger And give it to one who rsquo ll trade for a nail of a finger The tool of humanity will soon pick the lockFour doors of insanity Won rsquo t give ye a shock Three doors made of steel and one made of woodThe spear will block one will the gator eat as it should So enter within though inventory may be slightly fewerWe rsquo re at Chapter Two and this part rsquo s calledThe Sewers
Chapter The Sewers The Sewers we find are not at all hell They thrive underneath Limbo's vast Citadel A region where lost souls breathe lsquo tween life and fear A place which appears every year Step from the alley then turn where the Game Master sitsHe rsquo s known as the Keeper and will hand ye a new bag o rsquo tricks The hint to a first ldquo entry rdquo thoughyewill spy thriceLook fast for lsquo tis fleeting as he hands Briggs the dice So move on to the lift that rsquo s marked with ldquo rdquo And travel on down to the Sewers and pits Go out to the left and explore so ye will learnAnd meet with Jethro Quagmire in a place that recalls Bothlin Burn Poor Quagmire rsquo s shackled all by foot mouth and hand Use a finger pointed at him he rsquo ll speak though he stares at the sand If Briggs frees him twice more from chain and from ballHe offers the exits or not none at all So pick up the jaw clamp and follow on downAnd then to the North in a clearing turn roun rsquo Go up past the clearing to see something sillyA man caught in the mud Oh Gee
I think it rsquo s our Billy Our Billy has something again in his backHe rsquo ll give it if Briggs shakes a leg and offers his helpThough trying and pulling his leg Briggs doth crack A rusty sword is the gift from this hysterical whelp Now back from the clearing and back to the bog From the Shackled Soul who gave Briggs a clueFour times to the north then to the east he must jogTo see the three exits is what Briggs must do The chamber he spoke of shows three exits thereTo open the first one ye must have a care An item Briggs has with him will help ye decideThe opposite numbers then in he will glide Clue One spoke of numbers The ldquo opposing rdquo of SixAnd then the number of ldquo Three rdquo Soon ye will find in Briggs shall he be Twice the Keeper did show BriggsAnd well ye did see Into Sewer One is where Briggs must goThere is only one gate which will open you know Look to Gate It rsquo s at the far rightThe key is not far and not out of sight
'Tis guarded by a Monster WormIt is a god of the sea Although its single eye might have ye squirmSightless soon it will be Let it attack as it is just full of blusterThen look to the ledge Briggs' courage will muster We find on the edge a rusty old keyUse this on the gate and unlocked it may be Search here if ye will but there rsquo s nothing to seeYe rsquo ll use this room later just wait and let be So do read the notice up here on the wallBut save it for later not for chain but a ball And don rsquo t forget to check the left in Grate OneThere rsquo s much to find from that side here and wasn rsquo t it fun First is the Worrymeister who doth worry soIf Briggs visits him twice he will makehim go Now on to the rooms where Thor rsquo s Hammer doth sleepKeep it for later or Briggs will surely weep Also a flute hide here made of wood lsquo Twill call the rats when you need them if Briggs carves it real good You rsquo ll need something else to accomplish this taskOnce you find what you need in its glory you'll bask Brigg rsquo s already has it Quagmire rsquo s first giftLook and ldquo action rdquo it closely you rsquo ll notice its shift Now examine this new objectYes that's what you should do For looking at it closerWill give the Captain an important clue Is there someone here annoying Someone who's not very kind Who soon asBriggs triesto talk with himHe tosses Briggs out you'll find Perhaps if you direct the Captainto sneak up from behindAnd reach into the inventoryand somehow make him blind Then in this room the Captain may searchto find things to free Quagmire from his stolid perch But a pen and aninkwell This couldn rsquo t be right How doth a pen free Quagmire from his sticky plight Just fill it with ink then find something to bruiseThe Guardian of The Gates
Aye that rsquo s the ticket Go find him again then in his eye Brigg rsquo s will flick it Go back to Quagmire and free him from his shacklesHe rsquo ll offer Clue Two just like Barney Hackles Clue charges Briggs ldquo Add it all up It rsquo s the only way to go rdquo 'Twill open Grate two and put on the rest of the show A ONE and a ZERO as you have surmisedThe First and the Last Now don't be surprised So back to the grates and try for Grate twoIt rsquo s really quite easy to open the flue In does Briggs go to have a look lsquo roundBut take care to be nice to the souls that you have found In here we will find a gal known as Nora RattyShe does like her drink and she rsquo s really quite batty But likes Briggs she does and oft tells him so ldquo When you need me just whistle put those lips together and blow rdquo So find her a drink a bottle of hooch Could this be the love interest Nah Briggsy rsquo s scared of the smooch Look to the bar for the rum and you rsquo ll seeAnd do take the cutters or Quags won rsquo t give Briggs Clue Three Before we leave here a boat ye may find'Tis low in the water but have presence of mind Briggs must raise the level but first plug the drainTwill be his exit from here if he doesn rsquo t first go insane Great Quagmire free soon disappears quickBut as he leaves an iron ball he will kick A gift he will give to open Grate Three its metal with prongs like a thistleBut Briggs can't pass through so what should he do I guess he'll just have to stand there and whistle For the ball is too heavy like a ' Chevy So you see he needs some assistanceHere come Nora's rats Thank God there're no cats to offer it any resistance So into the First Grate with the quot Hammer of Thor quot Through the Power room gate and down to the Spigot Thor rsquo s Hammer he'll pound then the steam will expoundand move this ball with the speed of a frigate Now what to do
Has Briggs tried Sewer Two Find the Ball and then call back the rat Pull the drunk with the chain hit the control pad againAnd then tell Briggs to hold on to his hat Now the Water is high to the boat Briggs should flyHelp him in so he can quickly row There's no question or care 'cept to get out of thereIt's all done like a box with a bow Sit back your work all is done Now wasn't that fun So heave to with a sigh and a sneerGo ahead relax for a minute you'll seeFor you're now in Chapter which is known asDarkmere Chapter DarkmereBriggs rows the boat'Till port he makes here Snow falls yet 'tis warmIn the town of Darkmere Worrymiester so shall ye meetUpon the dock so purloin The first victim soon shall he beAs he gives Briggs three coin A child will accuseSo Briggs needs to perusehis composure as he'll be thought guilty by many He'll need to beware Seek an ally in the SquareFor time he just doesn't have any So off to Town SquareBriggs goes with some careand meets with a man who is blind Though true he can't seeHis wisdom's not freeThree coins will gain knowledge of mind A silver chain you will need for the capture to succeedYou'll find it way down Cutters Place Look through the snow on the groundfor the chain to be foundNow hurry
Catch up with the chase The Inn is the placeWhere Briggs should give chaseAnd seek out the Deputy Mayor Yet things are not as they seemThis is one nasty dream And he finds himself in a Barred Lair How to get out
There's no reason to poutAs Billy clues you with poise quot Empty vessels make the most noise quot Take the cup and make noise for the jailer A supper he'll offer Yuk Oh just take the darned coffer Though if Briggs eats it he soon will grow paler So
Give it to whom No one else in the room True but what of the window young squallies See who might be thereNo Briggs won't need a chairLook
It's the man who loves those quot creepy crawlies quot Offer the pot and likely as not quot A Gift for A Gift quot he may say Wait a few moments in allBriggs will go to Town HallSoon he'll be freed and well on his way Now the Mayor will charge him thereafterWith the Soul Taker rsquo s captureHe'll provide Briggs a notebook and map so well put With these tools of the tradeA detective is madeBetter hurry for quot The Game is a foot quot Look to the notebook to see what to doThere be plenty of items to get for a clue The map is the keyThough four keys you'll need findto open some doors and catch the Soul Taker's behind Now Victim Two does quickly appearIt's the Deputy Mayor See his face filled with fear Look at the clues
Match quot sign quot and quot foot quot A rubbing perhaps made from paper and soot Look to your map for a type of quot junk store quot Talk to the lady but notice the hearth near the floor Two items to use for evidence to take at the Stable Have Briggsy do it as soon as he's able A quot picture quot he's made though his fingers be sore What could it mean You've seen it before A symbol a sign a footprint it matches all threeLook to the map ndash lsquo twill show who needs to see This tradesman you findRecognizes the quot sign quot Four pairs he's created and givenTo the Blind man were shownbut the owners unknownHe did take them as he was bidden But have ye no fearthough blind he could hearThough sightless still had sense of smell Of the paddock and fieldAnd of what death doth yieldRang true as the toll of a bell Yet in knowledge there's dangerso found this blind stranger And better for these four he is slain Of the clues he had threeGee now what could they be A parchment an orb and a cane Look to the map to the Blacksmith's mayhap and study the clues Briggs has found Look carefully at them as well as the victimwho lies there frozen in pose on the ground To the Blacksmith Briggs goesTo see what he knows quot Try the Skurge brothers Billy and Danny quot The Abattoir and Stable is theirs Hmmm things do run in pairs It's a clue but you're soon to find many But let rsquo s take a pause and to the Registrar becauseIt's nice to be kind to the wearies See the Worrymiester scratched throughand a reference to who Oh Bless as the Captain's heart queries He spoke of a lass who he did not like to passCould it be the lady who owns the Pie Shoppe Though they're put out each dayNo one eats them they sayfull of mince
or full of quot meat slop quot Seven souls for one soulOf this the Captain's been toldMore than once if you're paying attention So continue you'll find as these clues will unwindThat the cure is an ounce of prevention Now Danny 'tis said has shoes full of leadBut jobs he has ndash well there are three The Abattoir is one and the Stables to runand the Prison he does that for free So off to the Prison cross that off your listand then to the Abattoir which is locked But near the Stables is whereyou'll find more evidence thereof the fields where no fields are blocked Yet now what of Danny
Is he with his Aunt Fanny Have you tried O rsquo Negus' house of Pawn Yes Danny is there so pull up a chair And listen to the tale that our Danny will yawn But as Briggs gets out something hits with a clout Pick it up as it's an important quot jinn quot Laura sends him a line we can read it just fineIt says simply quot There's more than one way Inn quot Skurge said that O'Negus who rsquo s getting quite famous and Billy are out with the Mayor So off to Town Hall why not
Go pay a call Just climb the stair and speak with the bear Then on to the office to hear Briggs' theory quot It's the work of the four and we don't think it's more quot Said the Captain who looks rather cheery A new place on the Map get familiar perhap The Society Hall but none there at allSave The DoGooders and a victim which makes the sum fourSo back to the hall where the Cobbler did fallFind the glasses and an apron of leather'Tis odd it still seems in this town of strange dreams There is snow though they're having warm weather We've seen glasses before on one who can't see though she wore Perhaps these are the glasses she'd use Would the Bric a Brac Shoppe be your next stop Or might these items be meant to confuse Yet the lass is not there and there's nothing to findSoit rsquo sback to the map to choose your next place Remember the note
Who she was what she wrote Perhaps little Laura will help you give chase The Blacksmith her father would speakand he doesn't sound meek though cautious for those who tell die There's a place down the lane to a person quite saneWho rsquo ll say more and it isn't a lie So please use your map there's no time for a nap For you'll find that the Mystic's your mentor She speaks of a quot Wall quot it's not nonsense at all To gain entry use left right and center Now Danny Skurge does appear and we'll lend him an earAs he tells of the fifth victim's demise Briggs follows him there straight to Town SquareWhere the dead is Ms Hudson the maker of pies Return to the Square learn of evidence there In Briggs' bag you find new items three A hat and a cork which says quot SIN quot Could it be from the Inn And a label says quot I quot that's attached to a key Think of what you have learned your grey matter has burned quot There's more than one way Inn quot A cork that is written with quot SIN quot and a Label with quot I quot attached to a key Use these three for a clue and you'll know what to do Find the Inn and prepare for a stormier sea Once inside you will find an entry hidden behindSomething large made with wood nails and tar It holds many dangerslike quot free drinks for strangers quot Need a hint
It's the Inn of Sinn Bar So now down Briggs does goto the tunnels below Where there be clues and items to find You're under the ground another entrance is foundto the quot Hall quot if you don't lose your mind There are keys to exchangeand costumes quite strange Take them all as its evidence to handle Briggs feels The Soul Taker will soon meet its makerBut first acquire a light and a candle Now take the time to consider this rhyme Check the name of the keys Briggs' exchanged thus One is marked quot O quot and the other an quot S quot don't 'cha know So off to the Stables and then to the Shoppe of O'Negus So 'tis off to the Stables as soon as Briggs' able Use the key and let us go in wily nily Find a man in this place his skin gone from his faceThen hide near the door and listen to Danny and Billy Wait till they leave then right back to perceivea small button we saw when Briggs hid behind barrels and bend By the door its right here far away things appearWhere are they now
Perhaps 'tis the Wall at Dead End But for now leave this be and look to the keywith the quot O quot for the Shoppe of the Pawn Maker No one to be found so have Briggs look aroundFind two things to help solve the Mystery of the Soul Taker Look in Briggs' bag to see what he hasthat might actually act as a double Those glasses in there you now have two pairWhere's that lady for whom seeing is trouble Remember the Manual I trust you have read quot Trust No one quot I do believe it had said To the Bric a Brac Shoppe but don't make any passesSee how she reacts when Briggs gives her the wrong glasses quot She's done quite enough quot you hear Briggsie sayHe'll then leave by the door yet make him go back the same way When he does she is gone the glasses weren't needed to see Look to the floor and pick up the key The key has a label marked with an quot A quot So back to the map and then to the Abattoir to make it OK Here the smell of death can be foundPick up the key then have a quick look around This is a key now marked with a quot C quot Two places with quot C quot the map does remit Yet if you try them no place will it fit So logic will tell that it's for the place still unknownOff to Dead End and see what Briggs might be shown Here at the Wall in the Dead End Recall what the Mystic said by her word Three things must he do of this you've already heard Push the blocks in the right order the correct sequenceCan't recall what it was Its somewhere in this poem now don't get so tense If the sequence is right an entry opens for you Enter with might for the very last clue Now use the key on the door that you seeThe Registrar's next is what Briggs will surmiseHe runs back to Danny who rsquo s still in the jail quot Jailer summon all Darkmere to meet I have a surprise quot He uncovers the four and unmasks the Soul Taker He plays like Watson and Holmes at b Baker Sit back and watch as Briggs acts out the sceneThen it's on to the next Chapter The Machine

Day One In a Nutshell Responding to a telegram from Allistair MacFarley you have traveled to Scotland and arrive at the family castle on a hill above the shores of Loch Ness
Mr Shastra greets you and introduces you to Ursula MacFarley who is visibly upset
Her husband has been kidnapped and her daughter Moira won't arrive until tomorrow
The stress is too much for her and she swoons
She is escorted off to bed and you are alone in the drawing room
Have a look around
On the desk is a newspaper describing the theft of a rare Celtic book and some amber disks
You can also look close up at a book about Electricity and Magnetism
Checking the sitting area are three hotspots
A cushion on the sofa and a liquor bottle on the small table reveal red hotspots indicating there is reason to examine them but that they are not yet accessible
On the coffee table there is a game of chess in progress
White appears to have a slight advantage
Don't fuss about the chess game it has no actual part in the game
Before going any further check your inventory right click
You don't have much no actual items but on the bottom are your notebook an empty wallet and a map that is not yet active
Read the notebook for some helpful suggestions
It suggests picking up your bag from your room and exploring the kitchen
The manservant said your room is on the first floor
That would mean up the stairs one flight not the floor we are on
Exit the drawing room the way you came in and go upstairs
At the top go left and left again
Your room is the second one on the right
Pick up the bag from the bed
A check of inventory reveals what you now have A flask of bourbon a knife a rope ladder a camera some Copper Oxide it's a fine black powder ink and paper
Also in your wallet is the telegram
Find the kitchen thus Go down stairs and enter the main part of the house through the doorway between the staircases
Turn right and go left into the hallway to the end
The grey wooden door on your right leads into the kitchen
Explore the kitchen thoroughly
Find the matches and candles in the drawer in the wooden table
Have a look at the call bells
Take the rag from the sink
Open the wooden key box next to the door and take the Passkey
You can do these things in any sequence when you do them all the bell from Mrs MacFarley's room rings
She wants a cup of tea
Exit the kitchen the way you came in
The stairs near the fireplace lead up to a dead end and the spiral stairs at the other end of the room lead up to the laundry room
At the end of the hall just to the left is the other door into the drawing room
Go in there and look at the sofa
The old lady must have lost her locket when she fainted
Take the pills and the key
Go back to the kitchen and straight across from where you enter is a dumb waiter with a cup of hot tea sitting there
Pull the lever to send it upstairs
Go up the spiral steps
When you arrive look right to find the laundry room
Take the tea
Go to her room which is at the head of the stairs
You think she needs a little help
Open your inventory combine the pills with the tea and give her the cup
She speaks of three crystals a banshee and suggests looking in her chest of drawers
Turn around look in the bomb chest and take the bottle of chloroform
Then go into the bath area unlock the chest on the marble table with the Small Key and take the Attic Key from within
Go to the dressing table beside her bed and take the Picture from the drawer
Exit the room turn left and go into the next room using the Passkey to unlock it
This room the green one is Mr MacFarley's bedroom
Immediately to the left is a bookcase you can open and take a document
This item goes into the wallet and is instructions for operating the telegraph
Save that for later
Go to the other end of the room and examine the curly maple table
In the drawer is an appointment book displaying a date to meet McGrab at the distillery
Use the left pointing cursor to see some fingerprints
It would be nice to 'lift' them somehow
Use some Copper Oxide followed by some ink to make the fingerprints visible
Then apply the paper to them to keep a permanent record
Let's go find the attic
Exit this room turning left
Follow the corridor until you come to the attic stairs
Go up and keep going until you get to a locked door
The Attic Key let's you in
Hey
Someone slammed the door and locked you in
Besides that it's dark
Step forward once and look left to find the candlestick
Use the candles then the matches to brighten things up
Look in the box on the table near the tower to see the photo album
There are pictures of your father Bruce McGrabb it was spelled with one 'b' in the appointment book Ursula Allistair and Moira MacFarley
Take his picture you might want to describe him at some point
Go to the left
You find another door but it too is not accessible
Still locked in
Go left again and open the cabinet
The paper lying there is a map of the area
Take it
It too is not accessible so you cannot use the map to escape the attic
Left again to the pile of stuff in the middle of the room
Take the crowbar out of the box
Head into the tower in the far corner
Seems like nothing to do here until you try to leave
You watch yourself being startled by a noise
Now the boarded up window is active
Pull down the boards with the crowbar and have a look outside
Holy Smokes
What you see when you don't have a camera
Oh but you do have one
Quick
Snap a photo of Nessie before she decides to go for a swim
Now try that other door
This time it is active
quot Unlock quot it with the crowbar
At the other end of the short hall is a trapdoor
It goes to the laundry room where Zounds
A ghost
That's enough to drive you to drink
Head into the drawing room and pour a shot of bourbon in a glass
Wow
There's one of the crystals
Now go across the main hall and enter the room that is newly accessible
Go straight across the room where there is a chest in the corner
Open the chest and take the Mead
Mead is an alcoholic beverage made by fermenting honey
It can range from mild to knock your socks off potent and is frequently flavored by the addition of fruit juices
Here's a little ditty for fun MEAD If it's good for ancient Druids Runnin' nekkid through the wuids Drinkin' strange fermented fluids Then it's good enough for me
Go to the far end of the room and find the locked cabinet
You don't have a key that fits but perhaps you could pick the lock with your handy fishing knife
Inside is an ancient document the Auld Alliance Treaty which dates from October
That's all in this room
Go between the stairs into the main house and down and around the left corridor to find the Library
The Library door is the one with the red drapes next to the back stairs
Poke around if you wish but there's only one thing to do at this time Find the book on the side table by the sofa and see the Phalaenopsis flower alongside a diagram of a greenhouse
Hint
Phalaenopsis orchids are wonderful showy plants favored by collectors and hobbyists
Some cultures attribute magical or aphrodisiac powers to them
That's all for now
Go to the front door and exit the house
Forward once then around to the right
Keep going until you come to the greenhouse
Go in find the flower and pick it using the knife
Then return to the front of the house and walk toward the loch until you arrive at the Celtic cross
On the base place the Phalaenopsis blossom and the decanter of Mead
The Banshee appears and gives you some history and some advice
This is the end of Day One
Day Two In a Nutshell Exit your bedroom and you hear muffled voices
Follow the corridor around to where the back stairs are and it seems the people are in that room above the library but the door is not accessible
Go down the stairs and into the Library
Someone left a Gramophone record stuck and it's most annoying
Go turn it off
Now you can hear the voices again and make out part of the words
Go up the spiral stairs and turn around at the top so you are facing the room
Overhead there is a trap door
Have a peek and overhear Bruce McGrabb and Moira MacFarley engaged in a rather unpleasant conversation
She ends by wondering just what he is concocting in his distillery
Well now
Whatever did she mean by that
Head into the main entrance hall finding the front door still inaccessible
Turn around and on the bench by the suit of armor is a small case
Open it take the Signet Ring and a letter intended for McGrabb
He appears and asks to meet you tonight at the distillery
You think it's prudent to go there right now
Out you go then the front door is working again
Around the left side of the house this time and to the stream at your right
Go to the boat pick up the oars and row to the distillery
Watch the caretaker that's the mean looking dude with the shotgun as he enters the building and shows you his best quot Do Not Enter quot look
If you try the door where he went in he glares at you through the slot
quot We're closed quot To the left toward the corner you can peek in the window to figure out where he is
To the left find the bolt cutters between the barrels
Keep going around where the water wheel is and find the chained door
Cut the chain and step inside
DO NOT go to the right
If you do you will kick a bottle on the floor and alert the caretaker
When you try to go through the door the result isGame Over Instead go straight ahead then right toward the door
Step in and realize that the office just to the right is where he is sitting
Don't do a lot of roaming around go to the office door and quietly pull it open
In your inventory combine the Chloroform with the rag
Use it on the old bugger to make him sleep
Now it's safe to rummage around
Look at the little satchel hanging on his chair and take the Grand Book of Kelia Crystals and the Ogams
Hey
Isn't that the book that was reported stolen
To the right on the floor is McGrabb's walking stick
Take the Chest Key from the top then pick up the cane itself
Go out to the waterwheel and use the cane to stop the mechanism
Then back inside the access to the cellar is no longer blocked by water
Go down the ladder
Fortunately someone left a lantern burning in there
Strange room
An electric chair of all things and some sort of machinery possibly an air pump
The only thing that seems to work is the small chest under the chair
Open and take the disks also probably the stolen items reported in the newspaper
Now that you've done that the chair is active
Pull it out and enter the door behind it using the Signet Ring
Then down the corridor you face three doors
At first glance it looks like a maze but fear not
It's just three corridors
The left one bears the sign of the Raven
At the end is what appears to be a puzzle not yet active
The center one marked by the cross leads to a closed door possibly to the chapel
The right one leads to a circular room containing a chest and an armoire with what seems to be diving equipment
Perhaps my guess about the air pump was right
Exit through the door and you find yourself outside the back of the castle
So the tunnel from the distillery connects to the main house
Go around front and inside again
Any time the map is working clicking on the castle will take you just inside the front entrance
Head for the Library
At the back of the room to the left of the curved wall examine the symbol in the niche
It looks familiar
A matching symbol is on the head of the cane
Use it to unlock Mac Farley's office
Don't go up the stairs just yet
Look to the left to see a bookcase
Go to it and look sharply down at the right side to find the hotspot
Use the chest key
Opening the door you find the inside of the door inscribed quot Foedis Francorum Scotis Anno Dominici quot I think it should say Anno Domini Look familiar
That's the title of the Auld Alliance Treaty between France and Scotland in
See the lockbox
It needs the correct date set into it
Can't remember Roman numerals
Try this MCCXCV
Your discover the instructions for an armchair puzzle
Poking around downstairs reveals no further action to be taken
Go up the stairs
I always wanted a room like this
Proceeding upwards you find an elegant armchair that seems to match the instructions you just found
Don't do it yet you would be zapped
Keep going up
Enter the laboratory
This looks like a fruitful place to carry out some kind of experiment but don't get your hopes up too high
Go to the near end of the table and pick up the Metallic Glove and the Window Handle
That's all for now
More later
Go to the armchair and solve it according to the instructions you found
Watch out
Use the metallic glove to take the crystal else you will be speared and it'sGame Over Someone locks you in
Now you are in a timed sequence
Too slow and it'sGame Over Go to the window and use the handle
You descend via the rope but someone cuts it and you land in the moat
You meet with Moira again and Day Two comes to a close
Hope they Scotchguarded that sofa
Day Three In a Nutshell You awaken again in the guest room
Go directly to Mac Farley's secret office opening the door by using the cane on the symbol
Look in the top left drawer of his desk and take two items the Observatory Key and an Indian Dagger
Head up the stairs and enter the metal door using your new found key
At the top look right and open the cabinet
Take two items the Raven Statuette and the Files
Examine the files to learn how to operate the machine downstairs in the lab
Now look close up at the Thermofax machine
There are two views the dial up control and the send receive scanner
Turn on the power
Consult your documents the memorandum to review the instructions
You find two codes and
The first one seems to not work so try the emergency one followed by your I D

Now the scanner will work
Send three documents the Fingerprints Nessie's photo and Moira's Code
When you back away the receiver rings and you can pick up the prompt acknowledgement
Their note suggests a full reply will require some research so let's poke around the lab a while
There is some basis in fact for the Thermofax device
The pendulum style scanner enables the sending and receiving units to remain synchronized
The sending scanner contains a photo electric cell and some optics and the receiver creates the image on special paper using a heated stylus
Actually it would take about minutes to send a full page
For the 's this technology was miraculous when the alternative would take two or three days by post
It's an early step in the Information Superhighway
At the far end of the lab table is a holographic projector
While such a device might have lived in the imagination of sci fi authors it couldn't have truly existed
Let's play with it anyway
Check the instructions in the quot Files quot you picked up
It says to put the Amber Disks on first then the Mirror Disks finally the Raven Statue
Finish the job with MacFarley's crystal and observe the results
The bird is projected in D holographic form and you can read the inscription If you seize the Celtic Triskel only the Raven will know how to open the path
Sounds like a helping hint if I ever heard one
Take the crystal and the raven
Back away and the fax rings again
Go get the documents
Three things arrive A note revealing the fingerprints as being those of McGrab and telling about the H M S
Grondo Conqueror submarine a sketch of the sub and MacFarley's message about the location of the Chapel Key
Go to the office and look behind MacFarley's oval portrait
Open the box with the Indian Dagger
Take two items the thirteenth century key to the chapel and a document that says I am the stones of PowerBut also the Messenger of the GodsI will half open the passageTo the one who in the proper orderWill know how to write my name
Time to go to the chapel
You can get there the long way or just haul out the map and click on the chapel
Insert the key and Oooops
it snaps off leaving you locked out
Drat
Guess that's to be expect of a seven hundred year old key
Belinda Banshee shows up and says something about knowledge and sky and of the Book of Kelia
You decide this means going in through the roof somehow and search for a rope
Remember that strong box where you found the oars
Check it now and it can be opened if you use the correct tool
Bolt cutters should do the trick
Take the rope and grappling hook
Go back to the chapel and around to the side
Combine the grapnel with the rope fling it over the peak and up you go
Well looky here
These symbols match the runes found in the Book of Kelia
Decode them to discover what they spell
From the left they say quot R C D S A I H quot Spell out the name quot Sirdach quot by pressing the characters in the proper sequence
Well the message was accurate at that
It half opens the passage
It's big enough to squeeze through provided you don't break your neck in the process
Use the Rope again
On the wall to the left is a marble tablet inscribed Risen from ancient times King Queen and Knight will crossglances and discover the path ofthe inexpressible power
Huh
Well if you examine the window over the main entrance there is bright multicolored light coming through
If you stand in the center of the chapel the spot where you landed you can see three stone figures that rotate
Maybe if you turn them so they face each other


Aha
The trapdoor opens and you can enter the underground chamber
There is the Celtic Triskel on a pedestal
Take it and uh oh
The trap door closes and the other exit is locked
Now what
What did that hologram say
Only the raven


put the bird on the pedestal and there you are back in the tunnels
Go through the one on the right that leads to the house
Quick tip Use the map
You arrive at the front entrance converse with Mr Shastra then it's off to bed for the night
Day Four In a Nutshell Go to the Drawing Room
My
What's that sound
Check the window at the end of the billiard table
Watch Nessie beast or machine
We don't know for sure as she approaches
Go outside over the stone bridge and to Menhir
Pick up a piece of fused rock and wonder why it crumbles
You decide to check underwater
Go to the cellar and take the diving gear Suit Helmet and Boots
That plus the air pump is more than you can manage to carry
Go outside and over to the greenhouse
Find the Wheelbarrow and Hose around the side of the greenhouse
You take it to the cellar
Step around it and put the diving equipment in it
Then try to lift the pump
Maybe big burly Mr Mohr can help
Go find him in the greenhouse
quot Yerr not partic'rly fonnd o' this life arr ye quot Now's your chance to ask him what's under that kilt anyway
On second thought


into the Loch with ye
This is a bugger of a maze to map
It's also hard to describe
quot Go to the rock turn left go to the rock go to the other rock


It's like saying quot Meet me in Nantucket by the gray house with white shingles
Before you move turn around and observe the bicycle and the closed exit
This is what you will be searching for when time is running out
Poke around a lot and learn what the nodes look like from all directions
Here in my opinion is the most important one
Learn to recognize this particular rock
It's the key to getting home
The reason is that stepping just to the RIGHT of it will help you get home
You should practice that route now
To the left side are three active arrows you can take
Only the leftmost one is correct
The other two are dead ends
Stepping through that left one puts you facing an enormous rock wall
Swing left toward some junk on the bottom
Then stay close to the wall once more and look straight down at your feet
Pick up the Broken Bottle
Again go along close to the wall
You see a sunken rowboat
Step over it and turn right at the next node
Again you see three choices
Take the one that goes between the two seaweeds
Here is your gate
Remember before you clean off the algae save the game
The Raven Symbol is revealed
When you step away your air is cut off
Go back step to the right of the two weeds past the boat along the wall over the junk and come to the rock pictured above
Now go to the right side of it and then slightly left slightly right etc
until you see the shipwreck
Go right of the wreck another step and you should see the bicycle and be able to step on shore
Climb up only to discover that Fergus has been knocked unconscious
Now you hear Moira scream
Go to the house
Check MacFarley's office
Someone has ransacked the place
Step further in and Ursula appears and tells you that Moira has been kidnapped and taken to the distillery
You tell her about Fergus and she advises you to take the pistol which is hidden in the drawer of her dressing table
Take it and use the map to zip to the distillery
On the way in across from the water wheel pick up the sack of sawdust next to the barrow
Then enter only to find yourself locked in
Cripes
Who's following us anyway
No worry you can still exit by the other door the one with the slot in it
Oooff
The maid has conked you on the head and locked you in the cellar
Evil bitch
You had suspected her already partly because everyone else could be eliminated one way or another and because you caught a glimpse of her as she locked you in the office
Look around
There is a leather strap hanging on the outside wall
Take it and attach it to the rightmost window
It's not obvious what you've done for the strap becomes invisible and the window appears inaccessible
Strange
Go across the room to the electric motor and attach the other end of the strap to it turn on the motor and yank the bars out allowing you to escape
In the process you have dropped your inventory on the ground
Pick it up and you will be confronted by the maid
This time she has a gun
Take your revolver and shoot the ropes suspending the heavy sack over her head
Whump
She is knocked out and you can take the booklet from her purse
It contains the Banshee who gives you more insight
Get a good night's sleep it's the longest night of the year
Day Five In a Nutshell Hope you're well rested this is one tough day coming up
Check your notebook
It implies you need to go underground
Check your documents
McGrabb's book refers to Alban Arthuran on the Winter Solstice Dec with the sign of Capricorn
As usual your day starts in the guest room
Use the map and zip to the greenhouse not because you want to go in there but it's the quickest way to the cellar
From the greenhouse go toward the back of the castle and enter the cellar
Use the tunnel to reach the junction of the three tunnels and enter the left one with the raven symbol above
You find the zodiac wheel puzzle
On the opposite side see the beam of light
This is the point where you must place the correct symbols
The Alban Arthuan segment is facing you on the outer wheel
Click twice to place it at the light
It's spelled 'Arthan' in McGrabb's notes
These guys are a little loose with their spelling Then place the Capricorn symbol at the light
Capricorn looks vaguely like ' ' and starts out close to you It's between Aquarius wavy lines and Sagittarius arrow
Click to the right five times to get it to the far side
Listen up
The only clue you have that you solved it is a little extra grinding sound indicating that something has changed
If you turn around the Triskel symbol on the rock can be entered
Now I have already vented my spleen about mazes
This isn't exactly a maze but it sure feels like one Click here for a map What you have here are three circular rooms a central area and three exits
The way you came in is locked
Another exit leads upstairs to the Triskel and the third one leads to the underground dock for access to the submarine
These exits can be accessed if you know the codes
The same notebook that gave you the Capricorn clue contains the codes
The three circular rooms are laboratories and can be rotated
You can prowl around outside them and peek in the portholes
One view shows you a chemistry lab another shows poor old Mac Farley wired to some kind of gruesome experiment and the third shows McGrabb and his Druid friends in a meeting
He describes his absolute power and the plan to destroy London
When the meeting ends you better turn around and duck into the exit or face the consequences
Game Over
After they leave you have the run of the place
Go to the central area
McGrabb has rotated his room the white lab so his friends could leave You can walk in
On the far wall find the controls and turn the wheel
This provides power to the three switches on the central pillar so you can rotate the other labs and gain access to them
Turn around and take the Triskel Chest from the desk and the Metallic Pliers and Platinum Key from the drawer
Go out the door to the three switches and open the red and blue labs by rotating them
Visit the Chemistry Lab first
To the right as you enter is a bookshelf you can examine
Learn the recipes for two explosive mixtures
Black Gunpowder grams saltpeter grams charcoalMix together grams sulfurMix carefully Dynamite ml Nitric Acid ml Sulfuric Acid ml glycerinPour into water to separate nitroglycerine Put sawdust in bottle Add Nitro to sawdust I found the ingredients for Dynamite in the right hand cabinet over the sinks
Some players report having to make Black Powder instead
I am speculating that it is randomly chosen which recipe you must follow and that the charcoal sulfur etc
are in the left hand cabinet
Notice that when you pick up the glycerol a pipette comes with it
Gather the bomb making ingredients now while you are not being timed
Then go see Mac Farley
Jeez
Those wires look like the back of my computer
Read the warning on the wall
It says to do the handcuffs last
Following the wires you turn off the helmet then the anklecuffs then the handcuffs
Middle Left Right
Revive him with the contents of the bottle
Following his dialogue you turn to leave only to hear Moira scream
The countdown starts
The timer will stop when you free Moira
The choice is yours how efficient you feel
If you wish to assemble the bomb now then free her it's more efficient but you must hurry
To free her first go to the exit leading to the underground dock and enter it by using the code
There's the submarine Moira in a cage and some equipment on the far left
Go to the equipment and look for a bucket on the floor
Take the star key
Now by following the connection from the crane suspending the cage locate the crane's controls
Use the star key to activate the controls
Now the lever
Careful
The lever goes both ways
If you choose the wrong direction she is lowered in the water and it's Game Over
for you AND Moira
Ta Ta Toots
To raise the basket place the cursor under the lever
Go set Moira free by clipping the chain
She heads home
You are no longer being timed so if you haven't created the bomb yet go back to the laboratory and do it now
The dynamite recipe calls for ml of Nitric acid and your container holds ml
Use it four times
Then four doses of Sulfuric acid x and one of Glycerin
Pour the mixture into the water
Place the pipette
Put the sawdust into the green bottle
Finally take the pipette and put the nitro in the sawdust
Take the bomb
Go to the rear of the submarine and place the bomb
Now for the Triskel
Go up the stairs to the Triskel Room and enter using the code
Open the hatch place the Triskel cabinet inside and retrieve the Triskel using the metallic pliers
Don't touch it with your bare hands or it's Game Over
Take the chest with you and go to the Observatory
There's Moira
Step to the window and watch the sub
Then it's up to you to detonate the bomb
The timer runs giving you only a moment to aim
Center the crosshairs on the sub and fire
That's the end of McGrabb and his evil plans
One final thing to do Go to the Celtic Cross and give the Triskel to the Banshee
She thanks you and returns the Triskel to its legendary place
Well done Detective

GAME BOOMER'S Hints Cheats and Walkthroughs
LORD OF THE RINGS VOLUME INTRODUCTION LORD OF THE RINGS VOLUME is the first game in a planned trilogy fromInterplay
For those of you familiar with the J R R Tolkien books the Lordof the Rings was compromised of three different volumes quot The Lord of theRings quot quot The Two Towers quot and quot The Return of the King quot The plot of the seriesis for poor Frodo Baggins to destroy the Ring that his Uncle Bilbo won fromthe vile creature Gollum in quot The Hobbit quot During the lengthy introduction tothe game we find out that Bilbo's ring is the One Ring that can rule MiddleEarth
Its power can be destructive therefore Gandalf has asked you todestroy it since he may be overcome with its power
The game introductionexplains everything that has gone on in the past however it does not give agood explanation of what your quest is Your quest in LORD OF THE RINGS VOLUME hereinafter called LOTR is totransport the Ring to Dol Guldur and destroy the Witch King who is an evilcreation of the wizard Sauron
Once you have done this the game is over andit will be picked up in Volume
LOTR is a huge game with many plot twistsand side quests to accomplish
Above all you must hurry to Rivendell for theCouncil of Elrond because the Black Riders are on your tail As I said there are many subquests to accomplish in LOTR before you canfinish the game
I am sure that I did not find or complete all the quests thatare available in LOTR so you may find something that is not mentioned in thiswalkthru
If you get stuck post a message and someone will help you out I will take you through the route I found which covers a lot of ground andhits most of the quests
LOTR is a very nonlinear game you can be almost atthe end of the game and still go back to the beginning of the game to get ordo something you may have missed
Also I don't think there is any one objectthat is necessary to complete LOTR except for perhaps the Golden Wheel andDurin's Axe
So don't worry if you don't have an item that I mention youshould be fine without it One last thing before I start
LOTR version is extremely buggy
Make sureyou look at your README DOC file to check which version you have
As of thiswriting the latest version is
If you have anything less call Interplayto exchange your disks
There are enough bugs in the earlier versions to makethe game unplayable including the infamous quot Bree Wall quot bug that will destroyyour characters one by one for no reason
This was fixed in version still get the latest version if you can
From what I've heard Interplay hasbeen very good about exchanging disks THE SHIRE When you start LOTR you are at your home at Bag End which has just been soldto your relative Lobelia Sackville Baggins so it is time for you to move out Your loyal friends Sam Gamgee and Pippen Took are by your side
RECRUIT bothof them and go into Bag End
Find the chest located at the eastern end in oneof the southern rooms
Use the PICKLOCK skill to get some silver pennies
Us ing the map located in the center of the manual leave Bag End and head westalong the path Stop in any hole to TALK to your neighbors
In LOTR most questions are oneor two words and when the characters talk back to you try to pick up on thekeywords they say
You can usually pick up keywords since most are capital ized
So if the character says quot I think I saw some Wolves today quot try askingabout quot Wolves quot next
Follow the path until it turns south and meet yourlovely relative Lobelia
She doesn't have much to say so just TRADE her thekey to Bag End and be on your way
Talk to Gaffer Gamgee who will be standingoutside his hole
He will mention something about some missing kids
Hm sounds like a quest When the path intersects with a path to the east go east and find AnsonGoodbody in the house
He wants his dog back
Head back west until you hit arow of bushes
Walk a little north use the CHARISMA skill and the dog willfollow you
Take him back to Anson where he will offer you a shovel for thedog
GET the shovel
Head south to the Mill
There are three humans guardingthe entrance
Wait until night falls and use the SNEAK skill
Find the deviceand push some buttons
The thing explodes into smithereens
I don't what goodthis does but doesn't it just make you feel warm all over that you brought ahalt to the industrial revolution in Middle Earth Next stop is the Hobbiton Inn
Talking to the bartender reveals nothing new so talk to Daisy
Her sister Taffy and Taffy's friend Freddi are missing andshe wants you to find them
Sounds good but you need some weapons before youhead for the East Woods ruins
Go to Great Roads Goods and buy torches and rations from Jolly
TRADE a torch and a ration to Sam and Pippen and EQUIPeach character with a torch makes a good weapon RESCUING TAFFY AND FREDDI Head off to the East Woods Ruins
Try not to go there at night since theremay be more wolves to handle
If you hear a howl you might want to head backsouth quick you aren't ready for a wolf yet
Before you get to the Ruins youwill hit a stone wall
Walk along the wall until you find a hole
Use theCLIMB skill and walk into the hole
Head north until you see Freddi in aspider web to the east
Walk towards the web and before you hit it a spiderwill appear
After killing the spider Freddi will join you
Get the star key the axe and use the READ skill to read the scroll
Walk south and take thewest path
When you hit the chasm use the JUMP skill to get across
When youget to the door USE the star key and find the ghost king inside
Again USEthe star key answer quot Y quot to the question and get the Ruby and the SilverPennies Exit this cave by JUMPing the chasm you will automatically exit by walkingsouth
You will find Taffy to the north of the Ruins she will join you im mediately
You will probably have to fight a wolf to leave the ruins butyou should be able to defeat it
Walk to the Grange in town and go to thebarn
Farmer Grubb will thank you for rescuing Freddi and he will give you ahorse in return
The horse is a so so fighter but he is great for carrying alot of equipment
In fact you will probably keep this horse with you for themajority of your journey
Go back to Jolly and CHOOSE Taffy
Have her buy atorch and as many rations as she can carry
When she is full TRADE all to thehorse and have her buy more rations
When she is full again divvy therations between you three
USE a ration to increase your stamina if it waslowered by the spider or a wolf
Go back to Daisy and DISMISS Taffy GREEN HILL COUNTRY Exit the Inn and follow the path to the Green Hill Country
On your map youwill see two shaded areas in the Green Hill Country
First stop is the easternarea
Search the area a bit until you find a hole
Walk into the hole and gosouth to a spider's web
There will be a bird caught in the web
Before youcan free the bird you will have to defeat a spider
Once the spider is dead the bird tells you about some elves and then it flies away
Exit the pit byusing the CLIMB skill and head due west You will meet up with a human named Hawkeye
Allow him to join your partyand keep going west
You will soon be confronted by an orc but with Hawkeyein your group the orc presents no major challenge
After you defeat the orc Hawkeye will take you to his cave
Once there Hawkeye hears some Black Riderscoming and stays to fight them
Take his sword and bow and go northwest
Youwill find a locked chest
Use the PICKLOCK skill to open it and take therations pennies bladepart and signet ring
Exit this cave by going east Go back to the path you used to get into the Green Hill Country and follow itback out
You will hear some Black Riders coming but an elf shows up to saveyou
He takes you back to a clearing and says he will answer your questions TALK to him and ask him about Elbereth
He will give a word of power ELBERETH
Leave the elf and head towards Farmer Maggot's great name farm FARMER MAGGOT MERRY AND ATHELWYN BRANDY HALL When you are at the farm go into the house and Farmer Maggot will ask youto fetch the healer for his son
Since you are such a nice hobbit agree to doso
Backtrack on the path you took to get to the farm and once you havecrossed the bridge immediately go west
There is a house a bit to the northwhere the healer lives
Approach the healer and he will follow you
Go backto Maggot's and go into the bedroom where the healer will leave and cure thekid
In appreciation Maggot will give you two mushrooms
Take them both Exit the house and go to the Buckland Ferry
There you will find MerryBrandybuck
RECRUIT Merry and cross the river in the ferry
Go to Cotton'sFarm and meet with Rose in the house
She will be glad to see Sam and shewill offer you a Token
Have Sam take it
Head to the Bucklebury Tavern whereyou find a lady named Athelwyn standing in the corner
TALK to her a bit andRECRUIT her
TRADE her some rations and the sword make sure you have herEQUIP the sword
Next stop is Brandy Hall Standing at the door of Brandy Hall is Esmerelda but she won't let you passbecause there is a ghost in the library
Use the SNEAK skill to get past her and go downstairs
TALK to Fatty who is all excited about the ghost
FindSaradoc standing next to his bed and TALK to him ask about the ghost and thekey
He will mention that he lost both his pipe and the key
Using thePERCEPTION skill you will find a pipe and some pipeweed under his bed
Getboth items and go west to the bathroom and again use PERCEPTION to find thegate key in the bathtub
Get the key go to the southern rooms to find somemore silver pennies and head back upstairs The ghost is hanging out in the library and he wants a pipe
TRADE him thepipe and he will disappear
Using the READ skill to read the books in thelibrary you pick up on a lot of useful information most importantly thepath through the Old Forest
Leave Brandy Hall and head east to the HedgeGate
USE the gate key to open the Gate and leave the Shire THE OLD FOREST After leaving the Shire you will see a short cartoon depicting what is goingon in the Shire
Those Black Riders sure sound like some evil dudes
You haveescaped them for the time being but now you have to get through the OldForest which is quite large
Remember that you read about the path throughthe forest in one of the books in Brandy Hall
It said to find the ruins atthe northwest corner of the forest to proceed south and east then followthe southern path which winds but you are also to avoid the eastern paths
Inessence this is the true path out of the forest but I didn't think it wassince I went east a lot
After about minutes of wandering I thought I wastotally lost but suddenly I was out When I thought about the directions that the book gave again I found thatthey were in fact correct
What the book tells you to do is to go south fromthe ruins go east for awhile then when you find the first path south takeit
If you have a choice between paths always take the south or west path If you have no choice then just keep following the path
The reason I wasconfused is that I went east and north a lot when the book said not to go inthose directions but I had no choice the path just wound that way
If youfollow the directions you should get out of the forest in about minutes When you get to a large hill you are out of the forest save your game here TOM BOMBADIL AND THE WITHYWINDE From the hill go east until you hit a river
Follow the river bank north and soon you will come to a bridge that leads to Tom Bombadil's house
If youwant to head west from the bridge and wander in the forest a bit until youcome across a large tree
This tree turns out to be Old Man Willow and he isnot friendly
He will capture a few of your party members
Answer quot N quot to thequestion about fighting the willow instead use the PERCEPTION skill to findan opening into the willow
Answer quot Y quot to the question about entering andinside the willow you will find the rest of your party
You will also seesomething shining near the middle of the tree
Going there you will find somepennies a bow and Smith's Ring
In this order get the pennies and the bow When you pick up Smith's Ring the tree will start to flood
Use the PERCEP TION skill to find an opening in the tree
Use the CLIMB skill to get out
Goback to the bridge and cross it to get to Tom Bombadil's house Alongside the house is Tom's garden use PERCEPTION to get some useful items Inside the house you will find Tom
He asks you to let him handle the Ring Let him do so and you will get another word of power BOMBADIL which willcome in handy later
I couldn't get anything out of Tom by talking to him sohead upstairs to Tom's wife Goldberry She tells you that she needs some lilies and she offers you a Gold Token tofind some for her
Take the token go to the room directly south ofGoldberry's and sleep
While sleeping you will regain full stamina and youwill have a dream during which you will learn the ANGMAR word of power Leave Tom's house and to the southeast you will find a small pool
Use thePERCEPTION skill and you will find that all the lilies are dead
Proceedsouth until you hit the river then go east
At the mouth of the river youwill find a cave
In the cave walk along the north part of the small pool andyou will find a Spider Sword
EQUIP one of your party with it for it's a goodweapon This a small cave and there is only one path through it
Take the path andyou will see an ice wall
Cast Athelwyn's Countermagic spell go to thesouthern part of the cave and use PERCEPTION
Get the ice staff
Exit thissmall cave and go a bit more south to find the Withywinde sitting on herthrone
Ask her for lilies and she will ask you to show her a token
USE theGold Token Goldberry gave you but the Withywinde needs the springstone tobreak some magic spell
She tells you to find the Ruddy Oak and give him anacorn Exit this cave and walk above the wall where you will find an oak tree
BePERCEPTIVE and get the red acorn
Go back to the small pool where the deadlilies were and go west
You will see the Ruddy Oak standing amongst sometrees
TALK to him and ask about the springstone
He says you can have it TRADE him the red acorn and he will join your party
If you didn't do thisand tried to get the springstone Ruddy Oak would have attacked you and he isa formidable opponent
Go directly south to the top of a hill USE the shovel and get the springstone
Go back to the Withywinde Ruddy Oak will leave yourparty along the way and TRADE her the springstone
Get the lilies and takethem back to Goldberry
She thanks you and says you are now better preparedfor your journey THE BARROW DOWNS After Tom's house we want to get the city of Bree but the only way to dothat is to go through the Barrow Downs first
The Barrow Downs is a nastyplace full of Barrow Wights humans who thirst for blood and perhaps worstof all fog
Fog will fall at any time and leave you without knowing whereyou are going
It will lift after a period of time
In the Barrow Downs youwill find Burial Pits and Circles of Stone
There are a lot of items to befound in the Barrow Downs but none are required to finish the game
So ifyou don't feel up to fighting just head northwest as fast as you can If you are feeling adventuresome walk into any of the Burial Pits
In mostof the pits you will find a single tomb that contains a dead body and thetreasure that was buried with that body
But before you can get to the trea sure you will in all likelihood have to fight a Barrow Wight
These creaturesare not too hard to kill but they will take your stamina down in good sizedchunks when they hit you
If you manage to defeat the Wight you will haveaccess to the treasure
GET all you want
Go into as many pits as you like Ithink there are about or
If you come across a pit with a sealed en trance you won't be able to get in so just bypass it Also found in the Barrow Downs are Circles of Stone
In each of these USEyour shovel at the grassy area in the center of the circle
You may or may notfind some loot
While wandering in the Downs you may come across a pit intowhich you'll tumble
Once you are down the game will say you are doomed ifyou don't do something quick
Time to use your BOMBADIL word of power
He'llarrive and take care of the situation
Find the stairs in this pit which leadto a locked chest
Use the PICKLOCK skill and inside you will find BarrowDaggers and some silver pennies
EQUIP anyone who is carrying a dagger or atorch with a Barrow Dagger
Leave your pony equipped with a torch so you willbe able to see inside the pits That is about all there is to the Downs onto Sharkey's Shipping SHARKEY'S SHIPPING The first building you will find once you are out of the Barrow Downs is abarracks building with three sleeping humans in it
Turn on your SNEAK skill and go the table located by the entrance
READ the document and write downthe message

Walk to the stairsleading to the basement
The bartender will tell you to stop but ignore him and walk on down The first thing you will encounter in the basement is a locked chest PICKLOCK it and get the loot
From here you have one of three ways to go Take the north path and then go east to find a sleeping Uruk
Approach thetable that the Uruk is sleeping next to from the right side
If you wake theUruk you will have to fight him

Head due west and you will findsome stairs going down
In this small sub basement you will find the nastyUruk Grimrod
But wait
Your loyal friend Athelwyn is a traitor
She goes toGrimrod's side and demands you hand over the Ring
Answer quot N quot and you willhave to fight both of them
After they are taken care of open the lockedchest using PICKLOCK and read the note inside
Backtrack out of this area andhead back to the treasure chest This time back however the humans aren't so friendly and you will have tokill all three of them
After they are dead take the last path from thechest which leads further downstairs
Again you will have to fight three morehumans when they are dead explore a little to the east to find Athelwyn'sroom and an evil book to the south
You can read the book three times to getsome clues to some of the secrets you will find in Moria
If you try and readit a fourth time you will be overcome by evil and attack your traveling com panions Leave this room and take the north path
This leads into a small cave
Youneed to get to the northwest part you will know you are there when you seethree exhausted Uruks
When you are near the rubble USE the shovel
An evilspirit will be let loose but it disappears
GET the Golden Wheel
We are donehere at Sharkey's Shipping so backtrack out and head due north from thebuilding until you get to the Great Road
Proceed west a bit until you get towatch another short cartoon
You have finished this section of the game
So it's on to Bree BREE Follow the Great Road west and you will cross a bridge that leads into thecity of Bree
There are many things to accomplish in Bree and it will bedifficult for me to tell you exactly where the houses or holes are so I willgive the general area that they are in you may have to enter a few to findthe specific one to which I am referring Anyway walk west until you hit a crossroad and take the north route
Stopinto the first building you see to the east and buy a prybar from Oakwright Get back on the path go north and it will eventually wind to the east andend at a house
Find the entrance to this house and enter
This turns out tobe Nob Appledor's house
He thanks you for getting him home and offers yousomething in return
GET Durin's Pick Exit Nob's house and go south
The path passes many houses you can stop intoany of them and talk to the owners

She has some interesting things for sale
I bought thespiritcharme although I don't think it did me much good
Buy it if you wantto and exit this shoppe
There is one more shoppe to the west but there isn'tmuch to buy there that you don't already have From the Charme Shoppe head directly north and you will run into thePrancing Pony Tavern
Go into the bar room and talk to Strider who is sittingin the northwest corner
He will tell you to meet him later in the parlor Walk to the middle of the room and Pippen will begin to tell some stories Answer quot No quot to the question and Strider and another character will leave Leave the bar and go to the parlor to meet Strider
Get all the hot food youcan and RECRUIT Strider now known as Aragorn his real name
He is a greatfighter I put him in the lead of my party Exit the Prancing Pony walk south until you hit the path and go west
Whenthe path turns north you will see the blacksmith to the east
Enter the shop and buy chain mail and a shield for everyone except the pony
If you arerunning out of space to carry things get rid of things like torches keepone equipped on your pony the gate key ale the rusty key and other thingsyou don't need
EQUIP everyone with the chain mail give Aragorn's cloth mailto the pony
One size fits all I guess The blacksmith was the last person I visited in Bree however there areother quests to solve in Bree that I didn't do
You can talk to Rayf Broganand try to get some information out of him I couldn't there is an itemcalled the Torc of Maladin to be found somewhere and there is a hobbit Ican't remember his name who will join your party if you PICKLOCK the door tohis hole
If you want to do these things go for it otherwise exit Bree us ing the east entrance ARCHET AND STADDLE After leaving Bree you will come to a crossroad
The path north leads toArchet the path south to Staddle and the Forsaken Inn is located at thecrossroads I found nothing of use in Archet except for a healer who will heal yourwounds if you ask him quot HEAL quot There is also an Inn but again I found nothingof use there Of more interest is the town of Staddle
The first house you will come to isthat of Ann Lilypool
She is glad to see you and if you ask her aboutLuthien she will give you the word of power LUTHIEN and tell you it willbe of use when you are under Weathertop
Also in this town is the Curio Shop where you need to buy a Green Skull believe me you will need it
The shop keeper also has a gold ring for sale but it sounds like just a piece ofjewelry to me
That's about it for Staddle next stop is the Forsaken Inn THE FORSAKEN INN The owner of the Forsaken Inn is a dwarf named Orin
He has a few interestingthings to say about Moria if you ask him the right keywords
Go to the south west bedroom and walk to the foot of the bed
There is a set of secret stairsthat lead to the cellar The cellar will be the first true test of your mapping abilities
It is nottoo large but it will give you a good idea of what you are going to see inMoria
You are on your own when it comes to mapping the cellar and the minesof Moria but once you get the hang of it it really isn't that bad
The waythat I am going to help you when you are here or in Moria is to tell youabout the key places within the cellar or the mines and when or if you getthere you can refer to the walkthru for help as to what to do In the cellar you will find many dead ends two cairns burial places oneset of stairs leading down to a room and some spiders to kill
The firstthing to find is the stairs
They lead to a small room where a ghost isstanding next to a table with green skulls on it and a place for a fourth USE the green skull you bought in the Curio Shop and the ghost will tell yousome directions to follow from Buri's cairn Next find Buri's cairn which is located in the southern area of the cellar You will know when you have found it because the game will tell you
Followthe directions given to you by the ghost which are west south east south east north and west
You will hit a dead end
USE your shovel and pick upGaladriel's Token
That's it for the cellar exit and leave the Forsaken Inn WEATHERTOP After the Inn head back to the Great Road and when it diagonals off to thenorthwest go due north through some grasslands and some swampy area
Youwill run across a stone wall and after that some ruins
At the north end ofthe ruins you will be referred to a paragraph in the manual saying thatGandalf was here
Use the PERCEPTION skill to find some holes leading down Use the CLIMB skill and go to the south wall where you will all be given the LUTHIEN word of power again and a hint about where to use it Use the ropeto get out of this cave When you exit this cave if it is nighttime you may be confronted with twoor more Black Riders
If you do you're dead meat unless you are lucky
Youcan't flee the Black Riders you have to fight them and they are the toughestfoes you will come across in the game
I suggest you save your game while youare in the cave just in case
If you don't get attacked or you manage to killthe Black Riders proceed north until you hit a small stream
Follow thestream to its source at the east and use the CLIMB skill here to get to thecaves under Weathertop Follow the underground stream a bit until you get to a bridge guarded by twotrolls
Trolls take a lot of hits to kill but they are slow and you shouldget at least two hits on them for every hit they can get on you
After thetrolls are defeated enter the cave
This is also a good place to tune yourmapping skills for Moria
There is only one item of use that I found in thecave
Go south in the cave until you get to a pool where the stream comesfrom
Go south around the pool You will enter a cave and will be attacked by orcs
Kill the orcs and takethe east path until you hit another larger cave
Go on the north path whichwinds its way back to the other side of the stream
Cross a bridge and youwill come to a raft
Use the BOAT skill to cross the pond and at the end ofthe cavern use the CLIMB skill
At the web you will be attacked by fivespiders
Kill the spiders use the PICKLOCK skill on the chest and get theBroken Wing
This is all I could find in this cave
Backtrack out of the cave and head south to get back to the Great Road THE TROLL SHAWS Head east on the Great Road until you come to the Last Bridge
If you talkedto some of the folk in Bree you learned that there is a passage under thebridge into the Troll Shaws caves
If you'd like you can use this passage but I didn't instead I explored the Troll Shaws before going underground
Ifyou take this passage you will still end up in the same place that I will betalking about later so don't worry Cross the bridge pick up the beryl on the bridge and walk on the Great Roaduntil you get to a smaller path going north
Take this path and walk untilyou see some ruins to the east
Go to the center of the ruins and USE theshovel
You have found the Troll Slayer which is a great weapon
EQUIPAragorn with it
From the ruins walk north until you see three troll statues gt From there walk west crossing one stone wall until you get to a second stonewall
Walk a little north along this wall until you see an opening into it USE your prybar to get into this small cave
Use the PERCEPTION skill to get ahint for later in the game
Exit this cave walk west bypassing some ruins until you get to a larger stone wall
Walk west along this wall until you getto another opening in the rock
Use the CLIMB skill to enter the main caves The main caves under the Troll Shaws are where you meet a few trolls and gettwo words of power
When you first enter you will need to walk a bit alongthe cave path until you are attacked by two trolls
Kill the trolls and walkwest to the pool
Walk around the pool to the north and enter a small cavewhere you will get the BEREN word of power
To the east of the pool enterthis cave where again you will be given the LUTHIEN word of power
Thepaths leading south from the pool lead to the passage under the Last Bridge but I wouldn't take that path out since you'll probably meet up with someBlack Riders
Instead backtrack out of this cave and go east to the smallpath to get back to the Great Road Continue your trek eastward
You will soon meet up with Glorfindel who willgive Frodo his horse to escape the Black Riders
Once Frodo is across theford use either the ELBERETH or LUTHIEN word of power to get rid of theBlack Riders once and for all
You will notice that their cloaks are along theriver banks but ignore them for now you will come back to get them Glorfindel has joined your party let's go to Rivendell RIVENDELL Enter this large house castle and find Elrond who is in the conferenceroom
He tells you to go get Gandalf so the Great Council can begin
ExitRivendell and immediately go east until you hit the Misty Mountains
Go alittle north and Gandalf will be hanging out by a rock God knows what he isdoing there
He will disappear must be nice to be a wizard
Go back toElrond and the Great Council will begin A lot will be said during the Great Council most of it refers to paragraphsin the manual
Finally you are asked if you want to destroy the Ring
Answer quot Yes quot of course
Elrond will then say he needs proof that the Black Ridersare gone
It's time to go back to the river to get the cloaks But first exit Rivendell and immediately go west until you run into theblacksmith's hut
Go in TRADE him the bladepart and the Broken Wing and hewill reforge the sword Anduril
EQUIP Aragorn with it
TRADE the Trollslayerto Glorfindel and EQUIP him with it
Go back to Rivendell go south acrossthe bridge and then west along the river until you see Legolas
RECRUIT him and go back to the main river where you crossed the ford Frodo should be in the lead of your group
Use his PERCEPTION skill and walksouth along the river
It is important that you walk on the river bank andnot the path next to the river
You will never find the cloaks if you do
Youwill find cloaks on the east side of the river
One is protected by a bandof wargs but with your powerful party they are no match
Go back to theford cross it and walk south on the west bank of the river until you findthe other cloaks
Go back to Elrond and he will give you the MELLON wordof power and some sort of potion to keep you warm
GET the potion and someathelas
DISCARD all cloaks you don't need them anymore There are a few more things to do in Rivendell before you leave
North of theconference room is Hawkeye's betrothed
Answer quot Yes quot to her question and shewill tell you to put a ring on his tomb
Exit this room and go upstairs
Gonorth and TRADE Arwen the beryl that you found on Last Bridge
She will giveyou her token in return
Go back downstairs and find Erestor in his room Askhim about quot Moria quot to get some information
You can also GET some skills although I found none of them useful
Elrond's son will also offer you someskills Go downstairs now and head west
When you get to the tombs USE the signetring you got from Hawkeye
His spirit is now at rest
If you don't do this you will meet Hawkeye's ghost in Moria
Go back east until you get to a winerack
Use the PERCEPTION skill and GET the wine bottle to reveal a passagenorth
Gimli will be standing here
I heavily recommend recruiting Gimli heis invaluable in Moria
My party was full at this point however so IDISMISSed my pony after TRADEing his equipment to my other characters andRECRUITed Gimli
You will also find Gloin in this cavern
Talk to him and hewill tell you very useful information about Moria Go back upstairs head east and GET any equipment you need from the Elfstanding there
Make sure your party has one torch and one rope
You shouldhave enough in your inventory to give everyone a sword bow axe or dagger as well as some sort of armor
Go back towards the entrance to Rivendell goeast and you will find Bilbo sitting in one of the south bedrooms
Answer quot Yes quot to his question about the Ring and he will leave Sting and some mithrilmail for you
I equipped Frodo with Sting and gave the mithril mail to Gimli who I also put in the lead of my party Exit Rivendell now and take the south path
You will come to a crossroadswhere the south path goes to Moria and the east path goes across RedhornPass
Unfortunately Redhorn Pass is blocked by a snowdrift at the summit asyou will find if you try to cross it so the only other way across the MistyMountains is to go through Moria
The south path will eventually end at theentrance to Moria
Gandalf tries to open the door but fails
Take over thesituation and use the MELLON word of power to open the gate
When you do so however you will be attacked by two Tentacles
After the Tentacles are dead walk north a bit to enter Moria MORIA You have persevered through about half of this game so far
Now comes themost enjoyable part of the game in my opinion Moria
Once you enter theentrance caves in behind you leaving you no other way out but to go throughthe caverns and caves
The major quest to complete in Moria is to find Durin'sAxe which is buried somewhere within the mines
With this axe your passageto Dol Guldur will be assured It is going to be a bit difficult for me to explain Moria in detail sinceyou must make maps for every level in Moria and I can't explain exactly wherethe stairs are where the treasure is etc
What I will do is to first give abasic outline of Moria followed by a level by level description which willhelp you to find the important pieces of treasure and to help you find yourway out If you were able to find Gloin in Rivendell he told you what you will findon some levels of Moria
This information will help you to find out exactly onwhich level you are
There are a total of levels in Moria
When you start you are on the first Level which is also first Deep and there are Levelsabove you and Deeps below you
There are two ways to go up or down inMoria you can take stairs or you will come to the end of a passage and betransported up or down
Unfortunately you have no way to tell whether you aregoing up or down but this is where Gimli will help you If you come to the end of a passage Gimli may say quot I feel we are ascending quot or quot I feel we are descending quot Take his word for it you have either just goneup or down a level
And except for one case you have either gone up or downonly one level
This is in contrast to the stairs in Moria which may leadseveral levels up or down
I don't recommend taking the stairs right off youmay find yourself getting very lost very quick
Rather explore the levels avoiding the stairs for the time being
Once you have got the hang of Moria take the stairs to get up or down quickly Mapping is essential in Moria but luckily it really isn't too hard
Thehardest level to map is the st Level st Deep and th Deep since they are thelargest
Some of the levels in Moria are rather small and very easy to map Also Moria is rather logical in layout and since you have an abovegroundview it makes it that much simpler to map
Since you have already had somepractice in mapping I don't think you will have any problems One last bit of advice before we start if you missed Gimli in Rivendell Istrongly recommend restoring a saved game if you have one and getting him Without his help and advice in Moria you may find yourself spending twice theamount of time there
That said let's get started FIRST LEVEL FIRST DEEP There is not much to be found on this level
I felt like it was really just atest of your mapping abilities
There are multiple stairs up and down alongwith several other passages that will lead to other levels
The most importantthing about this level is that it contains the exit from Moria
If you haveno interest in Moria you can exit quickly and get on with the game althoughI don't know how far you would get without Durin's Axe
WARNING If you chooseto find the Axe don't read the quot Exiting Moria quot paragraph until you are readyto exit Moria it may spoil a bit of the game for you SECOND LEVEL This relatively small level holds nothing of interest
On it you will findthe Mining Hall and several orcs to kill
During certain sections of thegame you will be told that you hear orc drums
You might as well get gearedup for a fight now because if you keep traveling in the same direction youwill more than likely run into orcs
With your party however you will haveno problem in killing any orcs that you come across THIRD LEVEL I found nothing of use on this level
The corridors twist and turn makingmapping a bit more difficult but other than that there is nothing that Ifound FOURTH LEVEL On this level you will find three ghost statues who are blocking a corridorthat leads out of the chamber of Gabilgathol
TALK to them and they want thesubject of Balin's note
Answer quot khazad dum quot They will then tell you what youneed to get Durin's Axe a Lady's Token the Golden Wheel a golden chisel anvil and hammer and a sign of the dwarven fathers
You have the token andthe wheel you just got the word of power SIGN OF SEVEN and you will findthe other three in Moria
They also tell you some directions to follow fromBuri's tomb Pass the ghosts and when you find a set of tombs use PERCEPTION to see ifyou are at the right set
Follow the directions now west south east south east north west and USE Durin's Pick at the end of the corridor
You willbe told that with the sign of seven Durin's Axe can be regained
Exit thisside passage and go north from the ghosts to exit this level
Note You willbe transported to the th Level from here not the th
The only way to Level is from Level FIFTH LEVEL This is a simple level to map
Basically it is a large hall surrounded by abelt of passages all of which lead into the hall
On the west side of thehall you will find two things of note
First is Oin and Ori
They want you tofree them
Use the KHAZAD word of power that the bird on Deep gave to you They will tell you two helpful hints quot Use Durin's Pick to break the seal inthe Hall of the First Fathers quot and quot Durin's Bane hates the Golden Wheel quot North of Oin and Ori you will find Drisnak and he wants a ring
If you haveSmith's Ring give it to him otherwise you will have to kill him
No bigloss
Go to the fireplace use PERCEPTION and you will find a black key
Whenyou get it everyone in the party will be affected by a poison cloud
Time tovisit the healing pools on level SIXTH LEVEL This is an interesting level with many things to find and do
There are threehealing pools here
You can walk through one them as many times as neededuntil you party is completely healed
Also found on this level is the Hall ofthe First Fathers
Before entering the hall turn on your PERCEPTION skill Walk around the hall a bit until Gimli tells you that Durin's tool will showthe way
USE Durin's Pick to find a secret cave
On the west side you will beconfronted by the spirit that you let loose when you got the Golden Wheel Four trolls will then attack you and after they are dead you are told thatDurin's curse has been lifted
I suppose that if you didn't do this you wouldfind more trouble when you went to get Durin's Axe I am not sure
Anyway exit by going back the way you came and you will be back on the th level
Goback to this time going west of the Hall and then head south and east tofind the stairs to the th Level SEVENTH LEVEL This is the smallest level in Moria and there is only one way out
Follow thepassage until you get to the book
Use the READ skill to read it
After a fewREADs you will be attacked by two orcs
Kill them and then quickly exiteast any hesitation will result in your death
The stairs here will lead tothe rd Level TWO DEEP The Deep levels are where you will get to the good stuff in Moria
On Deep you will find an altar that will lead you back to the th Level if you decideto clean it
Otherwise find a small pit blocking the passage and use theJUMP skill to get across
In the far northeast part of this cave you willfind Kiri
If you can RECRUIT him in you can't just leave him
South ofKiri you will come across two Snagas really wimpy orcs
Kill them andgo west
Here you can kill two Uruks to get Smith's Ring back if you gave itto Drisnak THREE DEEP When you descend to this level Gimli will say that you are getting into someheavy orc territory
He is correct as usual because you will soon run intotwo of them
When they are dead find the stone troll that is guarding apassage
Kill the troll and head to the tombs
Use PERCEPTION and you willnotice that a stone slab can be moved
USE the prybar to reveal a passagedown
If you have a rope USE it now otherwise use the CLIMB skill to getdown
Without a rope it is very difficult to get back up since you need tomove in very small increments at the end of the passage keep trying theCLIMB skill until you can get out Now that you are down just where are you
This level which I will callDurin's Level leads to Durin's Axe the main goal of Moria
If you have thegold anvil chisel and hammer continue
If you don't exit back up out ofDurin's Level because you will need these three items
Durin's Level isexplained near the end of this section FOUR DEEP This is a fairly large level and you will be fighting many foes so be sureyour stamina is up
To the north of this level is a pool with two bridgesleading from the mainland to a small island
Cross either one of them andfind the stairs up
You will have to kill an Olog Hai before you can continue After the Olog Hai is dead go to the southeast corner and use the PERCEPTIONskill
You will see a small passage leading up
USE the prybar and then CLIMBup
Go north a bit and you will have to defeat yet another Olog Hai
After itis dead the bird will give you the KHAZAD word of power which is used tofree Oin and Ori on Level
Exit back out and cross either bridge again This time across however you will have to fight sets of tentacles each and they are not easy
The exit down is found in the southern region of thislevel FIVE DEEP This is one of the smaller levels in Moria and it holds two things of in terest
First you will notice a set of several staircases leading down
Don'ttake them
You will have to fight two trolls to get to a set of tombs
Whenyou get to the tombs you can use the prybar to release yet another troll
Itseems like it was just a false passage to help decrease your stamina
Secondthing on this level if you enter one of the side rooms you will be attackedby two Uruks
Kill them and GET the magic mail and the axe
Walk the centerof the room to the hole and use PERCEPTION to find some mithril mail SIX DEEP After descending to Deep you will immediately enter a large hall
In thecenter of the northern part of the hall is a gold throne but when you ap proach you will be attacked by some trolls and orcs
After killing them Ifound nothing to gain from the throne so I suggest hugging the south wall ofthe hall and avoiding it altogether
Along the south wall you will notice twosmall rooms
In the western room you can get back up to level by walkinginto the west wall
But you can only get back down if you have the star key The exit from this hall is to the west cross the bridge JUMP the chasm andfrom here you can north or south On the north passage you will find a pit
Get close to the pit and use theCLIMB skill to get down to Deep After a bit of walking the south passage will lead to a large cavern
Takethe first north passage from the passage you are on and keep heading northuntil you are attacked by six Uruks
Kill them and go west to the Dragon'sChamber
Here you will be notified that you will be toast if you don't leavenow
Ignore the comments and keep walking west until you are told that youhave found something
GET the White Wings
Next thing to do is find the largepool in this cavern
When you are told that you see a bird in the middle ofthe pool USE the White Wings and then TRADE the White Wings to the eagle
Hewill give you the THORONDOR word of power
If you head west from the mainpassage you will cross a bridge where you will see a vision of the WitchKing whom you'll meet later in the game
Also in this cavern is an exit toLorien if you have Galadriel's Key which you don't
You may want to keep thisin mind to use this entrance to reenter Moria later SEVEN DEEP You will be in a small cave when you first enter Deep which contains vastamounts of mithril
USE the shovel to get some if you want but I found no usefor it
For a laugh save your game here and keep digging for mithril
Inthis cave is a pit where you find out that Durin's Bane was let loose
Walkinto the pit and use the PERCEPTION skill to find a crawlspace
Use the CLIMBskill to get the second section of Deep After climbing follow the only passage you can to the east JUMP the twolava pits and you will find a large hall to the north
On the north wall youwill find another throne but this one is guarded by a Balrog
You have nochance if you fight him so USE the Golden Wheel to get rid of him for now
Goto the throne and use PERCEPTION to find a locked chest
Use the PICKLOCKskill and GET the lady's token the golden anvil chisel and hammer
Just anote here I found that after I got these four items I still didn't havethem so I had to go through the whole process again
I don't know if this isa bug or not just make sure you have the four items before you leave
Goingback for them is a real drag DURIN'S LEVEL Now that you have the necessary items to regain Durin's Axe go back to thethird level tombs and climb back down to Durin's Level
Go up the stairs andyou will see three doors
I found this area to be confusing so I recommendnot trying to map it rather just walk until you get somewhere and don't takeany stairs
Take the left door and head north until you find a pit
Walk intothe pit and use PERCEPTION to find a hole in the ceiling
CLIMB up andyou will be in a small room Walk due north
USE Durin's pick when you are told to use a tool and a dwarfwill appear asking you two questions
TALK to him and tell him quot seven quot first then quot mahal quot to answer his questions
You will be told you can pass walknorth to yet another small room and walk straight into the north wall
Youwill be transported to the area where Durin's Axe is kept
Basically this isa central area looped by a passage
Walk along the outside passage TRADEingto each of the ghosts you meet the item that it wants
When you havedoled out the three golden items walk to the center and use the SIGN OFSEVEN word of power
Something will fall to the floor pick it up and youhave regained Durin's Axe EXITING MORIA To exit Moria you need to find a long bridge on the far east side of thefirst Level
When you've crossed the bridge Durin's Bane the dreaded Balrog will appear on the other side
You will be referred to many paragraphs in thebook about your doom which is what will happen if you don't do the properthing right now
Don't even think of fighting the Balrog he will waste you Instead USE Gandalf's Wizard Staff
You will be treated to a fun sequence inwhich Gandalf destroys the Balrog
Once the Balrog is gone you will noticethat Gandalf has also disappeared
I guess he expended himself
You can nowexit Moria by taking the east passage
At the end of the passage you will beattacked by three Uruks and you thought you were through kill them and saveyour game
You have exited Moria and are now in the forests of Lorien LORIEN After exiting Moria you will be standing near some ruins
Walk east a bit and suddenly the Ringbearer and another of your party I lost Sam Gamgee dis appear
They have been taken prisoner by the Witch King and spirited to DolGuldur
This sets up your final quest of the game rescue Frodo and defeatthe Witch King
But there is a lot to be done before you can do this and thefirst thing is to meet with Galadriel the Queen of Lorien Head northeast from here until you get to a river
Find the bridge thatcrosses this river and keep going east
You will cross another bridge andthis time an elf Haldir will ask you for a password
TALK to him and say quot Elrond quot He will take you to the Golden Wood the home of Galadriel
Walknorth from Haldir and you will see a gate to the east when you hit a row oftrees
This gate is one of two entrances to Caras Galadon a city of elves Walk through the gate and go west to cross a bridge
Now walk north andfollow this stream around until you are told that Galadriel's home is nearby Walk directly west and you will see a large tree guarded by an elf
This is aflet and this one is Galadriel's home
Walk up the ladder and you will seeGaladriel and Celeborn
Galadriel will greet you and tell you she will helpyou out
She also states that if you find objects for her she will give yousomething
These items are the Crown of Elanor a scabbard a silver horn anelfstone and the light of Earendil's star When you talk to Galadriel she won't say much except to meet her at themirror
You can RECRUIT Celeborn and I recommend doing so
Exit this flet and head south until you get to the stream
Walk south along this streamuntil you see the mirror which looks like a bird bath if you ask me Galadriel will appear and she will tell you the fate of Frodo and his com panion
Doesn't sound like he is doing too good
After a lot of information you can pick up Galadriel's key which opens a door back into Moria From here there are many things you can do
You can exit Lorien and go toDol Guldur you can walk around the city and talk to various elves for help you can attempt to retrieve the five objects Galadriel spoke of and or youcan back into Moria
The route I chose was to attempt to find the five ob jects
I saw no reason to go back into Moria but if you missed somethingthere this is a good time to go back
If you don't feel like finding the fiveobjects skip to the last section quot Leaving Lorien quot THE FIVE OBJECTS The city is really quite large and the only thing I can tell you in yourattempt to find the five objects is to just wander around and talk to theelves asking them about quot elfstone quot quot crown quot quot scabbard quot quot earendil quot and quot horn quot for help
Enter all of the flets you come across some you can enter and some you can't
In some you will receive various useful items from theelves within
Since you lost two party members you can try to RECRUIT anotherelf you should be able to find several who will join your party The order in which I found the five objects is elfstone horn scabbard crown starlight
From where you are standing at the mirror exit the city bythe same gate you through which you entered and walk south until you seeHaldir again
A bit to the east of Haldir is a large mound known as the quot Moundof Mourning quot Walk around the outside of the mound using PERCEPTION until youfind the elfstone
From the mound walk west crossing the bridge on which youfirst met Haldir until you come to the first bridge you crossed after exitingMoria From here you can do two things
If you talked to some of the elves in CarasGaladon you might have learned that the reason that Redhorn Pass is blockedis because of an evil spirit Caradhas
He is holding the bird of spring pri soner and freeing the bird will free Redhorn Pass
If you want to attemptthis quest skip to the next section quot Redhorn Pass and Caradhas quot then returnhere otherwise continue Stay on the east side of the bridge and go north
You will see many ruins tothe west
When you can go north no more and must go east or west head alittle bit southwest until you see some ruins
Walk around the ruins usingPERCEPTION to find the silver horn
Go back northeast and go east this time You will walk for a while until suddenly you are attacked by an orc
Youhave stumbled across their camp and they're a bit steamed
After the orc isdead an Uruk will attack
After it is dead you will face an Olog Hai andanother Uruk
After this victory the rest of the camp will run away
From thebattle scene walk southeast to a swamp
Walk around the outside of the swampto the east until you see a small clearing to the south
Walk to the clearing and you will find out that it is a sinkhole
Use the CLIMB skill and GET theEagle Eye
I was hoping that by using the eagle eye I would get anaboveground view but it wasn't so Walk south along the river and the forest to the west will end
When itdoes head west getting as close the tree borderline as possible
When yousee a little brown patch to the south go to it and use PERCEPTION to find thescabbard
Keep walking west and you will get to the second gate into CarasGaladon Go back to the mirror and from it walk west southwest
In one of the fletshere you will find a female elf who is in love with Legolas and because ofthat she gives you a Crown of Elanor don't ask me why
Go back to mirrorand wait until night falls When it does USE a bottle or wine bottle to cap ture the light of Earendil's star
If you don't have a bottle I think youmight be out of luck I couldn't find any other way to get the light You now have the five objects of which Galadriel spoke
Now comes a part thatgot me a bit frustrated
Galadriel told you that when you found the five ob jects you will get something in return
Well I tried to TRADE all the ob jects to her but that did no good
I DISCARDed the objects but again nothing happened
I also tried to USE the objects but that didn't help
Itried TALKing to Galadriel to see what she would say but it was the same oldthing about meeting her at the mirror
I went back to her flet but was toldby the guard that I was ready for my final quest
I finally said quot enough quot Idon't know how to get the object Galadriel promised
Perhaps I misread the in formation she gave me maybe you will have more luck
But I did complete thegame without it so who knows what the object might have been REDHORN PASS AND CARADHAS At the first bridge you crossed go north from it on the west side of theriver
When the river curves off to the west go west until you get to theMisty Mountains
Walk along the foot of the mountains until you see theentrance to Redhorn Pass
Follow the pass until you get to an impassable snow drift
Walk about paces east and use PERCEPTION
You may have to try it ina couple different spots until you see a cave above you
Use the CLIMB skillto get into Caradhas's cave This is a very small cave
In one of the two rooms of this cave you will seea bunch of bones and you can GET the malach key
The second room contains aladder and some ice ponds
Don't walk on the ponds since you may fall in andlose some stamina
Go up the ladder and you will find Caradhas
Surprisingly he is not happy to see you and attacks
When you finish off Caradhas walksouth to find a bird encased in ice
Have one of your party USE a torch tofree the bird
He is very grateful and tells you that Redhorn Pass is free Exit this cave the way you came into it
To tell the truth I didn't try to gowest to see if the snowdrift was still there
According to the bird itshouldn't be and you should be able to get back to Rivendell LEAVING LORIEN When you are ready to leave Lorien take the east gate and walk east to theriver
Along the river you will see a dock and Galadriel will appear askingyou if you are ready to go
Answer quot Y quot and she will tell you some informationabout Dol Guldur and she will give you two words of power and some lembas The first word OROME will help you to capture something or someone that ishard to get
The second MELIAN will help you to counter any deception youmight find along the way
Also Galadriel tells you that a wizard Radagast may help you if you can find him
You are then taken across the river to makeyour final assault upon Dol Guldur RADAGAST Travel west on the road you are on and you will soon come to a north southintersection
Take the north road to Radagast's house
This is a long andtwisting road and when it ends walk a bit more north until you seeRadagast's house
Walk inside there is nothing of interest on the firstfloor so take the stairs up On the second floor you will find three cages
If you go near the cages anduse PERCEPTION you will find a lot of animals locked up
Use PICKLOCK to freethem
I don't know what good this does but it makes you feel good right
When I freed the animals it said that the wolves on the far wall growled but for the life of me I couldn't find any wolves anywhere
Take the stairsup to the third floor On the third floor you will see Radagast and a bird that is locked up in acage
If you ask Radagast about quot bird quot he will tell you that it is a spy ofSauron
I tried to free the bird just for the heck of it but didn't succeed You won't get anymore out of Radagast so RECRUIT him
If you have a fullparty of get rid of an elf that you may have picked up in Lorien Radagastis a good fighter with lots of stamina and his spells may help you out alongthe way Leave Radagast's house now
When you leave you will be told that the animalsin the forest run from Radagast
I found this to be strange and from otherplayers of LOTR they said that Radagast turned into a werewolf on them at onepoint in the game
It seems that this Radagast is a fake and the realRadagast is hiding out somewhere
Radagast didn't turn into a werewolf on me so if he does on you you found a part of the game that I didn't get to play Follow the road back to the crossroads GOLLUM AND THE FOREST MAZE Take the south path now and soon Celeborn will tell you he's leaving
Atabout the same time you will run into the vile creature Gollum
You caneither USE a rope or the OROME word of power to capture him
He agrees tohelp you since in the back of his mind he wants to get his quot precious quot back He or it will tell you that you can't approach Dol Guldur via the main road and says he will show you a secret entrance Walk east on the road until Gollum tells you to get off
Do so immediately Following the road any longer will result in a winged creature capturing allof you
You will enter another forest maze but unlike the Old Forest mazethat you already went through this maze is much easier
There is only onepath through it
You will have to fight a few spiders here and there but soonyou will come to an intersection where one path goes north and the other goeseast If you take the north path you will find a statuary where you will be at tacked by five lifelike statues
They are not too easy to kill and after theyare dead you'll find nothing of use
And when I tried to exit I was againattacked
So I think this path is just a red herring
Instead take the eastpath and you will come to section where the hedges are rather small
Walkright through the hedge and Gollum tells you to go east to a big stone
Thestone is actually more north than east but anyway when you see a stonepillar walk around it until you find the secret entrance to Dol Guldur DOL GULDUR Dol Guldur is a fortress that is composed of ten levels
Inside you willfight a lot to get to Frodo and Sam
Mapping Dol Guldur's levels isn't reallynecessary each level is actually quite small
Your ultimate goal is to get tothe top level where you will meet up with the Witch King
As in Moria I willgive a level by level description of Dol Guldur in the order that I exploredthem
I am using level as the lowest level up to level as the highest You may want to skip some of the levels that I didn't find anything on but ofcourse I may have missed something
The level descriptions are only what Ifound you may find more LEVEL FIVE When you first enter Dol Guldur you arrive on Level
Here you will findtwo prisoners of Sauron a dwarf who doesn't want much to do with you and ahuman who will join you if you free him which I couldn't figure out how todo
You will need to kill the Uruk and the two spiders and then use PERCEP TION to pick up the red key
This key doesn't open the cells on the level however it will be of use later LEVEL FOUR Taking the stairs down you will immediately be attacked by three Olog Hai's They are not easy to kill but after you have finished them head southwestand go in the entrance
Follow the passage around after being blinded twice and take the stairs down LEVEL THREE When you enter here you are warned that not all is at it seems
Use the MELIAN word of power to put everything back in its proper place
I couldn'tfind anything on this level there is a staircase down in the northwest corner LEVEL TWO This is a maze level
Find your way to the area where you cannot cross be cause you are blocked by a red pit
If you try and cross the pit your leaderwill turn to stone
I found no way to get across other than losing at leastone character
I put one of my lesser characters in the lead saved my game and kept trying to cross until I lost only that one character
When you arefinally able to cross follow the path around until you see a staircase down Walk through the wall east of the staircase I know it sounds stupid and youwill be attacked by three sorcerers
Kill them to take the staircase down When you come back up to this level walk south to the evil eye that is sur rounded by walls
When you walk into it you will be transported to anotherarea on this level but this way you won't have to recross the pit LEVEL ONE This is the lowest level of Dol Guldur
From the stairs walk west betweenthe fire pits
If you have Aragorn in your party he will think that you aretrying to kill him and he will abandon the party
Walk a bit more west andyou will see a cell to the north
Before you can get there you are attackedby a Nazgul
After he dies you can GET another malach key
Walk to the cell and USE the malach key to free Sam Gamgee
He tells you that Frodo is beingheld on the highest level of the tower
Time to head back up LEVEL SIX From level you can exit Dol Guldur if you wish
There is a small boxlocated near the southwest stairs
Use the DEVICES skill to open the draw bridge
Before you can exit though you must get through some orcs
You arethen shot twice with some arrows which further lowers your stamina When you exit Dol Guldur you are informed that a Nazgul is going to finishyou off but none attacked me
If you go west from the entrance and thennorth following the outside wall of Dol Guldur you will soon see a keep offto the west
The entrance to the keep is to the south
I found nothing ofinterest on the first floor take the stairs to the basement
There you willfind two Troll statues and one of them is mumbling something about needingsome power
I searched the basement for any kind of a switch or something butI didn't find a thing to bring the Trolls to life
I also tried some spellsand words of power without luck
They probably would have just attacked me anyway
So the keep was a dead end Back on level of the tower in one of the rooms is a slave orc Juithrech If you ask about quot prisoner quot he will tell you where they are being held butyou already knew that
I searched some of the other rooms but after meetingsix Uruks in about every one I finally gave up and took the staircase up tolevel LEVEL SEVEN This level contains a large center section surrounded by a several smallerrooms
In the center area you will see a red carpet that leads to a throne tothe north
Before you get there you are attacked by a sorcerer and threeUruks
After dispatching them I searched the throne but found nothing LEVEL EIGHT We are reaching the top of Dol Guldur which is evident since you are walkingaround at the top of the castle
Walk east from the stairs and kill the fourorcs that attack you
You will find the entrance to the center section on theeast side
When you enter I recommend taking the southern hallway since inthe northern one you will be attacked by five humans
Taking the south hall you will be confronted by a single human
Answer quot Y quot to his question anddefeat him
He will tell you that he hopes you fail big surprise there
Thestairs to level are to the west LEVEL NINE This is also a level with a main center section surrounded by two hallways If you attempt to go north on the red carpet get ready for a hairy battlewith an Olog Hai a sorcerer and a Nazgul
After this battle is over you canapproach the throne but again I found nothing
The stairs up are at thenortheast corner but you can't get up them because of an invisible lock
Timeto USE the red key you found
Take the stairs up to level LEVEL TEN AND ENDGAME You will finally come into confrontation with the evil Witch King himself
Heis attempting to fly off with Frodo
Use the THORONDOR word of power and agroup of eagles will attack the Witch King
He can't fly away now but he isready to fight
After a lengthy battle you have finally completed the game You will be treated to a fun endgame sequence telling you what is going on inthe world since you got the ring back
Also we are told that the game will bepicked up in the second volume of LORD OF THE RINGS THE TWO TOWERS
Now that's something to look forward to GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
Vivendi Universal Games Table of contentsIntroduction to the Walkthrough Hobbiton Bywater Green Hill Forest Labyrinth Withywindle Path Barrow Downs Bree Weathertop Hill A knife in the Dark Troll Shaws Rivendell Hollin Gate Labyrinth passages nd hall Abyss Fight Lothl rien Orc Dam Amon Hen Appendix First of all I would like to express my feelings regarding this game
I was not sure if I would dare to even play it as I was afraid it was a rather dull game and that it would ruin the nice picture of the Shire as well as the other places I had already built in my mind after years of reading and loving Tolkien's works
But the game was not that bad as I found out after playing it for a bit
Yes some have been added in order to make the game more fun to play but these changes are not that big so it does not go too far away from the book itself
The playability met my demands at least even though there were some problems during my travel through the Mines of Moria
Also the AI of the companions could have been a tad better but it did not ruin the game too much and to sum it up it's well worth the time to sit down and enjoy
This walkthrough does not contain each and every small event that occurs throughout the game but concentrates on the bigger ones or those whom need more attention in order to solve
Ah where it all starts and being able to walk around in the Bag End taking a look at all them things that you have read about all these years well I am just happy they got it quite correct as the picture I had built myself after reading about Hobbiton Hobbits and such
The game starts as Gandalf speaks to Frodo about the darkening hour of the One Ring and of Sauron
He suddenly notices that there are someone outside of the window and grabs after it
Sam comes through the window and as a quot punishment quot for his eavesdropping Gandalf appoints him to be a companion of Frodo when the latter is setting out of the Shire on his big quest
You need to collect a few items in the Bag End before going of to Bywater to sell your lovely Bag End to the Sackville Baggins
The Deed which you find in one of the bedrooms and the key which are located out in the hall right before you go outside
In order to get to Bywater just follow the road over the bridge and you will reach Bywater
Lobelia Sackville Baggins is located in the house on the other side of Bywater when you first enter through the gate
When first talking to her she will just insist that you go hit the bell that is located in the middle of Bywater just go there throw a rock at it and return to Lobelia
Now she will happily accept the Deed of Bag End
Your task now is to get back to the Bag End and get the One Ring which is located in the other bed room
Go out again and move along to deliver the key right before you get there you will see that there is a Nazg l asking questions about you and this cinematic moves on
You deliver the key and now its time to run run along the path over the small hill and down to the road below
Watch out for the Nazg ls that are sweeping the roads
A head you see the bridge to Bywater which you need to cross there is a Nazg l standing guard there run towards it and hide behind the Mill
The Nazg l will come and look for you as it would have heard you
Throw some rocks further up the road mouse button and wait until he goes to see what the noise was
Then sneak around the corner and over the bridge hold down shift to sneak
In Bywater you will have to face a wolf use your walking stick and beat the wolf until its dead
Advance through Bywater out the east gate and into the Green Hill
Here you will face a pack of wolves
And there are two ways of escaping them
One is to use the One Ring if so beware the purity meter in your upper right corner if it's too low the Nazg l will get you the other is to simply try to outrun them which often works as well
You then walk on and you will soon see that another Nazg l is blocking the road in order to pass him you will have to follow the stream downwards hide behind the big rock and throw some rocks back up the road you came
The rider will then go to see what the noise was and you can then sneak past him and over the bridge so sneak hold down shift while walking
Congratulations you've reached Farmer Maggots Farm where Pippin Muntiadoc and Sam are waiting for you and you will soon find your self in the Old Forest
You have reached the Old Forest your companions Pippin Muntiadoc and Sam have disappeared and you need to walk around in the forest in order to find them
The road may appear blocked but just walk around a little and you will see it is suddenly are open
Beware of the spiders that lives in this forest they can do much harm but if you just go at them with your stick without stopping you can easily defeat them
You will find your companions without much struggle and make sure you pick up all the mushrooms you can find as you will need it later in the game
After a walk you find yourself under the leaves of Old Man Willow and before you know it Sam is a sleep and Pippin and Muntiadoc are trapped inside of the tree
Throw a rock at him in order to get past his roots without getting hurt
Then avoid his quot hands quot which slams to the ground and hit his hands with your stick as soon as they touch the ground and keep on doing this while running back and forth from one side to the other without getting knocked to the ground
After doing this for a time Tom Bombadil appears and puts Old Man Willow to rest
Then help Tom Bombadil to collect lilies to Goldberry the task is simple just make sure you walk along with your companions so that it is easier to fight off the spiders you encounter
After collecting all these lilies Tom Bombadil takes you home to his house where you after a short rest walks on to the Barrow Downs
The walk there are filled with lots of dangers first you and your companions encounter wolfs but these are easily beaten
Then during the night Muntiadoc Pippin and Sam disappear and you Frodo are left all alone and will have to fight ghosts on your road to find your friends
These ghosts are harder to beat than the other enemies you have encountered so far
The best way to beat them is to run around hit the ghosts then fall back and continue this until they disappear
The ghosts usually come in packs of at the same time and make sure you do not get caught in the middle of those three
Then at the end of your travel through the Barrow Downs you are facing a Barrow Wright
You can not beat it with your walking stick
You will need to climb the wall behind the Wight and get the small blade of Westernesse that is in that chest up there
When fighting the Wight make sure you keep moving all the time
His breath is dangerous and the best way is to hit and run and continue with this until Frodo starts to sing Tom Bombadil's riddle
Tom Bombadil then arrives freeing your friends and banishes the Wright
And follow you until you reach the town of Bree
When arriving in Bree the first thing you need to do is to enter the Prancing Pony and get a room from Barliman Butterbur
After that go to speak with Strider and here the game changes view
You now control Strider which needs to go out to first find Muntiadoc whom are missing
When you enter the streets packs of Wolf have been released and there are also men out there half orcs and alike whom want to kill you in order to get to the hobbits
You will have to go find Muntiadoc whom are located down the main road and in a back yard
Then fight off the wolfs you find kill the four men that stands in your way and collect some items that are needed in order to fool the Nazg l later that night
The items are spread around the whole town one item is located in the Stable two others are located near the south gate and the last item is located in the guard room around at the north gate
Collect these items bring them back to the Prancing Pony and watch the cinematic while the Nazg l wrecks havoc at your decoy
The walk to Weather top is nothing difficult
You will face some minor enemies on the road but those are easily fought off
The challenge begins when you arrive at Amon S l where a big troll resides in the ruins at Weather Top
In order to kill this troll you will need to be light stepped
Run around make quick attacks withdraw and run around
Concentrate as the troll does much harm and he only needs a few hits with his club before you die
Also if you got a lot of cram then you can also run up behind him and slash him with your sword until you are pushed away this will attract damage to you but it is a far more effective way to kill a troll
After this you are attacked by the Nazg l and Frodo gets wounded and later that night you are attacked again and you Strider will need to fight them off using fire
But do not leave Frodo as they will kill him and take the One Ring
Hold a stand over Frodo and fall out to attack them instead of just waiting for them to attack you
And make sure you are not trapped with Nazg l on all your sides
Keep on fighting them off until they give up and withdraws
You are now near Rivendell just a final struggle before you can enter the wonderful house of Elrond Half elven
You will encounter Orcs which you can easily kill and also you will face three trolls first a single troll along with some Orcs use the same tactic as I explained above then later two more trolls
I do not have any good explanation on how to get past these
Just make sure you got the Hobbits with you when you arrive here and just do your best attacking avoiding and with some effort you can get past them
Right after you've killed these Trolls you will meet Glorfindel whom places Frodo at his horse Asfaloth and Frodo barely manages to escape the Nazg ls whom haunts after him but are wiped of when the river that encircles Rivendell arises and washes them away
Nothing specifically happens in Rivendell the Counsel of Elrond is held the Fellowship of the Ring is formed and Bilbo hands you some of his precious belongings
Most of the events in Rivendell are cinematic and you can just sit back and enjoy
After some time you continue your quest along with the Fellowship of the Ring
You here play as Gandalf while fighting your way towards the East gate of Moria nothing spectacular just a lot of Orcs that needs to be taught some manners
The real struggle comes when you arrive at the East Gate while Gandalf is occupied trying to figure out how to open the doors you then play as Aragorn and you will need to protect Gandalf from the watcher in the water
In order to manage to stun this creature use your bow shoot at his tentacles and eyes run back and forth avoiding his attacks and keep on doing this until you have managed to stun this creature
Then Gandalf will have managed to find the correct word to open the gates and your journey through the Mines of Moria is at hand
Moria is filled with puzzles and Orcs
The orcs are easily killed and does not attract much effort
But in large groups they can get quite dangerous so make sure you let your companion do a lot of the work
In the beginning you control Gandalf and when you enter a big hall with the rest of the company you there need to find a way out
While the others are fighting the Orcs and trolls that attack you you walk over to the Statue in the middle of the room
Here you will notice that there are four buttons around it and four stones
Use the 'use button' usually 'E' and 'Enter' Hold it down while you use your walk forward button 'W' and place the rocks above these buttons
After all buttons have been pushed down a door will open and your quest further on continues
When you reach Balins Tomb Frodo and Gimli gets trapped in the nd Hall and needs to find a way back to the others
The first thing you need is to run across the big hall being Frodo jump over the cracks in the floor and climb up kill the archer that guards up there and pull that blue rock of the very edge
Climb back down jump back over the cracks let Gimli take care of the Orcs and go to the rock you just pushed down
Push it over the button and the Door you need to go through in order to get to your friends is opened
The problem is that you are still far away from that door and need to fight your way to it
Some time later you reach a place where you have huge ladders
Frodo needs to climb these ladders avoid the Orcs that guards up there run across climb down on the other side and pull the switch in order to open the bridge so that Gimli can pass
Beware that when you climb down that ladder and touches the ground there are a few Orcs coming up behind you so make sure you quickly open the bridge and run across to get aid from Gimli
Then just walk on until you are back with the rest of your companions
Some later you will face the Balrog the view is now put to Gandalf and in order to fight the Balrog you need to cast the Lightning spell at him to stun him and while he is stunned attack him with your sword slash him three times withdraw he awakens stun him again and keep on doing this until Gandalf breaks the bridge
If you need health or more power for your spells then you can either use your inventory if you have been a good player and collected on the road or get from the other side where the rest of the companions awaits you
Finally the cinematic takes over Gandalf destroys the Bridge bur the Balrog takes Gandalf down with him into the deep
The companions now get out of Moria and find them selves soon in the beautiful forest of Lothl rien
Lothl rien is as Rivendell mostly just cinematic
Enjoy the fine cinematic and take the short time you have in Lothl rien to explore what you can
You will also be looking into the Mirror of Galadriel both you Frodo and Samwise Gamgee
As well as the Fellowship will regain their strength before setting out again
Before you can sail down the Anduin with your boats you need to kill the Orcs Trolls that hold the shore
You Aragorn Gimli Legolas and Boromir can easily defeat the enemies that is holding the shore and you will soon find your self travelling towards the very end of this journey for now that is but right before you are heading of one of the flying Nazg ls arrives and he takes of with Sam which he mistakes for Frodo
Your departure is cancelled as you will need to go hunt for Sam and the Nazg l
You control Aragorn while Frodo follows
The way up on Amon Hen is crowded with Orcs and Trolls and the best tip would be just to try to fight your way up using the technique that I taught you earlier in this walkthrough Weather Top hill
The last struggle to get up on Amon Hen when you take control of Frodo is just to run run past all them Orc Guards that is trying to close the way and all the way up on the top
When you reach the top the view will change back to Aragorn and just use the same way here just run past all them Orcs as it is easier and faster
Killing them would take time and after fighting of all those Trolls you might not have enough power to manage many battles
When arriving at the very top of Amon Hen you control Aragorn and are facing a flying Nazg l
The first attack would be when he's on ground and then you could simply attack him just making sure you avoid his black breath as it drains your power quickly
Then the Nazg l will take of encircle you around Amon Hen and try to attack you by sending balls of Black Breath down on you
Avoid these balls and shoot at him standing on the Throne when he flies around
Do that for some time until Legolas finds a good spot and sends of the arrow that kills the beast
You have now finished Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring
Congratulations
As I said in the introduction I have left out parts that I do not see important
The walkthrough is written as I finished the game and is just an example on how you can finish it
I hope this little walkthrough was of some help and that you enjoyed reading it
Red red kriminell com GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
Lord of the Rings II The Two Towers Walkthrough Aragorn on the Plains of Estemnet When you start the game you control Aragorn Legolas and Gimli in The Plains of Estemnet
Right away you are attacked by six orcs
After they are dead head north
You will see a message continue heading north then you will GET some ale and after that an elf brooch
Walk around the battlefield if you want to talk to the Riders of Rohan
North of them is some rations

Go into the north west passage and see an old man
The second time he appears tell him SARUMAN and he will turn into Gandalf
Frodo on the Cliffs You will be transferred to Frodo and Sam recently dropped off near Mordor
GET all the stuff make sure you give an elf cloak to each of them as they make them partially invisible andharder to hit you won t be able to see this
Go south east
It is hard to get down the cliffs but keep trying
Find Gollum near the tree on the third cliff
HIDE from him
USE the rope or the elf rope to capture him
Head south into the marsh until you come to the north east pond
On the east side of this Gollum will catch a fish
Go to the path of lights
Pippin in Fangorn Now you are using Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck
They are weak characters and you need to get an ent to protect them as fast as possible
They are also in the maze forest of Fangorn fortunately not too difficult to map or traverse
On the west path is Quickbeam but he doesn t want to help you yet
So head over the live tree bridge and then go west to Treebeard
Answer Yes to accept his hospitality and GET ent draught
Say SARUMAN to Treebeard
Answer No to his question so you can explore
You now have Quickbeam to watch over you
I made him the leader as he is a strong fighter
On your way to the bridge Stiffbranch will ask you for an ent draught
Don t give it to him now because you aren t hurt but later this will come in handy as he heals you plentifully
Go across the bridge and then go west as far as you can and then north
GET the two rations
Then go back to the north of the bridge and go north
Go west as soon as you can for two black acorns believe me you ll need them to pacify the huorns tough evil ents especially if you didn t RECRUIT Quickbeam
Go north again and you will get a message saying you are wanted back at the Entmoot
Go back to Treebeard
Gandalf in Estemnet Go deeper into Gandalf s forest and COUNTERMAGIC the magic cache
You will GET loads of stuff
Go back to the entrance of the forest
Travel south west to Estemnet
On the way there you may or may not meet up with a magic cage
which will release four Barrow Wights if you COUNTERMAGIC it and then you get nothing
I just avoid it
You may also meet six orcs probably the messengers outside the Burnt Forest they also give you nothing
Luckily there is a man in Estemnet called Bregowine who will restore your health with a meal if you answer Yes to his question
Go east from Estemnet and meet with Heof who says that if you clean the pool of the orc shrine he will give you the skill RIDE You can skip this if you want
Go west and then ATTACK the shrine at the north of the pool
Six barrow wights will appear and after they re dead the shrine will crumble
Go back to Heof and he will give you the skill RIDE
Back at the pool there is a horse called Sunhood
RIDE him and take him to the north of the pool
Now you have a pool of infinite healing
Heof says show your RIDE skill to the Riders of Rohan
I couldn t figure out how but I don t think it s vital to the game
Frodo in the Dead Marshes Follow the ghostly path to the Keep if you like
Inside are three levels you entering on the middle one
On the top floor is a bat dropping bespattered altar and about seven bats
After fighting them I found nothing so my advice is to skip the top level
If you go downstairs there is a prisoner elf Gilglin who keeps saying he wouldn t let me sleep
I found no way to make him join me
If you want use PERCEPTION on the north east sarcophagus
A ghost appears and asks for the star ruby When I gave it to him he turned into a Vampire so I suggest you don t bother
At the north of the big black box a vampire will grab you and pull you inside
After fighting him and three bats you get a dagger and a spirit key
EQUIP Gollum with the dagger and USE the spirit key on the door in the north east corner of the middle level
On entering USE the phial on the cauldron blessing you with the word of power ELBERETH
USE the phial also on the altar to relieve some of the darkness
That s about it for the Keep
Exit and you will see a mud hut to the north
Inside is either a live man who will kill or be killed or a dead man slain not too long ago
I found nothing else inside
There are a few sinkholes hidden in the marsh and if you choose to go in them you will find one oath sworn elven prisoner Nendol and in another a ghost you can ATTACK for the star ruby
The exits to these sinkholes are found on the edges of the caves
When you leave the marsh and the dead battle grounds you will either meet six four or two orcs encounter a huge army which you must SNEAK past or HIDE from the road to Ithaldien or just a message that you have entered Ithaldien
There may be others
Quickbeam in Fangorn As you go over the bridge Quickbeam insists that you go off and find some fresh clean Entwater away from where the burarum orcs have been
Generally travel west until you reach the riverbank clearing furthest west
Quickbeam will help you over the deadfall to a secluded spot
GET the four Entwater bottles
Treebeard has told you that you must ask Leaflock and Skinbark what they know about the orcs
Leaflock is located in the north west section of the forest in a medium sized clearing Skinbark in the north east in a larger clearing
If you have trouble getting there wander about until you find Longroot
He likes to walk so if you ask him about Skinbark or Leaflock he will take you there
TRADE Leaflock some Entwater
To the west of Leaflock is a sort of spiral at the end of which is Greenroot
Asking him about ENTWASH will cause him to give you four bottles of the Entwater
Gandalf in Estemnet Heal yourself RECRUIT Sunhood and go back to Estemnet
TALK to Leofyn and she will say she wants her husband s sword a bag of gold and her son back as a wergild
Go north into the Burnt Forest until you come to a party of orcs
SNEAK or HIDE until three or four have left
ATTACK those remaining
After they are dead you will get a sword
Question the uruk about GOLD and then SNAGA and he will tell you where it is hidden
Go north into the north east forest passage
Go to the east and help Harding and Folwyn drive off the orcs
It turns out they are the children of Leofyn and Harca
Two down one to go
Go into the west part of the fork and GET the bag of gold from the dead snaga
Now return to Estemnet and Leofyn will thank you
You get to keep the sword and the gold but not Harding and Folwyn
EQUIP Aragorn and Legolas with their chain mail
Now you can go south and meet Dorlas
Dorlas will tell you plenty of useful things like There are horses being chased in the south east his brother Walcnouth is wandering about somewhere south of Estemnet the messenger orcs must be stopped and other things about battles
Walcnouth will give you some chain mail which I gave to Gandalf
If you choose to free the horses travel east and slightly south of Dorlas and ATTACK the parties of three orcs and three uruks
I guess it s just a good deed
By the way there is food and ale and athelas just sitting around so if you want to search for it go ahead Go south to leave the plains and Sunhood will leave you
Travel west along the river until you come face to face with Deorl and his Rohirrim
TALK to Deorl and he will conduct you to Edoras
Travel south to enter the city
Frodo in Ithaldien If you are not on the road then Sam may ask Gollum to hunt for food
I don t think it makes much difference as he runs off when a fight starts anyway
If you keep to the road you will in all likelihood be attacked by three Harads
They are almost impossible to beat with two hobbits It is very difficult so I am assuming you bypassed them
If you do manage an oliphant will run off to the south but I think it runs off anyway
After crossing the bridge south of the Harads keep to the road
You will meet Faramir and his men
USE the phial to prove you aren t servants of the Dark Lord
Answer Yes
Heal all and teach Frodo and Sam HERB LORE
Now when they USE athelas they will get a lot of health
In the east of the room is a shovel
GET it and the rations and other stuff laid out for you
Go up the north stairs and answer No to Anborn s question
Go to Gollum and CHARISMA him
Leave the cliffs EQUIP Damrod and Mablung with swords
Put Faramir in the lead as he is the best fighter
Around south somewhere is the Mumak a huge oliphant CHARISMA him and he will join the group
Go to the crossroad and head slightly east
GET the statue head CLIMB the statue and USE the statue head
Faramir says something is missing a polished gem
CLIMB down and go to the east
ATTACK the four orcs and immediately be PERCEPTIVE and READ
I have a feeling this paragraph has something to do with the missing gem but I cannot be sure
Along one of the rivers Gollum will want to catch fish
Allow him and if you are in the right place he will spit out a gem
USE this gem on the statue after CLIMBING it
The bridge which the Mumak cannot cross is over the east end of a strangely split river
On the north side of the east end JUMP in Mumak and all
to resurface in a damp cavern
Before taking many steps however you will be plunged into darkness
USE the phial
Go north if you feel like fighting the Mewlip It looks and fights like Gollum I can t believe a warrior was killed by it
Then JUMP the chasm and USE the shovel to clear away the rubble from the tomb entrance
Enter and GET the bracelet from the corpse in the north west corner
Look at the message the invisible ghost on the east side gives now
DISCARD the bracelet when you are near a Numonerean woman s cold as death
sarcophagus
Go east for a shield
GET it and EQUIP someone with it
Exit the tomb and USE Sting to fight your way through the webs
Kill the Mewlip and leave the gold
Exit through the river
On the south side of the entrance river end there is a scorched ring and a man answer him NO USE athelas and if you wish RECRUIT him
Quickbeam in Fangorn Go see Linandel the ghost in the north middle part of the forest
TALK to him a bit and then go along the passage to the ruins
GET the ent seed
USE the ent seed where it glows
Go back to Linandel and ask him about RUINS
He will tell you there is a secret entrance
Back in the ruins the entrance is in a new grown tree on the far north east wall Enter and GET the fountain water
Use PERCEPTION around the elven symbols to find a secret entrance
Enter and GET the magic sword and magic bow
Exit cavern and go back to Linandel
Chat some more and head off to the bridge
Once in the middle USE the fountain water and GET the lembas
Go back to Linandel
You should now have a ghost who will always heal you
Go to Skinbark in the north westclearing and fight off the six orcs attacking him
Question Gazmog and Skinbark thoroughly
TRADE some Entwater to Skinbark if you want
Wander around all the dead end passages near him until four orcs attack you
Kill them and be PERCEPTIVE to find their secret camp
You can skip this part if you want but I recommend doing it if you have Linandel to heal you
Enter the nearest house and kill Flizpot
GET the chain mail the key and the silver pennies
EQUIP one of the hobbits with the chain mail
In the next house are six orcs in a circle
Kill them and GET the leather armour and the rest of the stuff
EQUIP the remaining hobbit with it
In the third house are four orcs
Kill them and GET the shield rations and hot food
EQUIP the hobbit in leather armour with the shield
Below the third house are four orcs burning the trees
Kill them and go west
Twiglate the ent will join your party
North of the northern house is a secret passage
Enter this and kill the four orcs that attack you
GET the ent seed
CLIMB the trap on the southern wall Teach some people about ELVEN and HERB LORES in the library
USE Saruman s key on the silver doors
GET the source water
USE it in the dead tree room
GET the vine and rations
You can explore the underground passages to the west if you like but I prefer to wait until I use Aragorn s company as less orcs attack and I have more room to carry stuff then
I will assume you will wait
If you want to abate the threat of the huorns forever find the clearing below Greenroot s spiral and slightly to the west on the automap
TRADE the giant huorn there a black acorn or two
He promises not to attack you
Head back to Treebeard now
If on the way you meet Redcone the Healer ent ask him HEAL and CLIMB his branches
This fully restores your health
Once you meet the Entmoot and Treebeard they will transport you to a crossing near Isengard
With Treebeard in your party head west until you reach Isengard a very large fortress
Enter from the south and kill the last of Saruman s orcs
Gandalf to Edoras Cross the bridge
You will be stoped by Riders of Rohan
Use RIDE on them
Go east to Edoras Faramir in Ithaldien Be PERCEPTIVE on that ring
GET the sword shield and torch
EQUIP Frodo with the shield and Gollum with the torch if he has no dagger
I think if you go to that ring earlier there is a Southerner who answers by referring you to paragraphs
I don t know what to do with him
If you feel you have finished with Ithaldien TRADE what you need from Faramir Mablung Damrod Anborn and the Mumak as they will abandon you the minute you enter Morgus Vale
Take the path east of the crossroad into Morgus Vale
Frodo on the evil bridge Follow the path to the bridge
USE phial to free Frodo
Gandalf in Edoras Go south down the path towards the small castle in the middle
I will come to the houses later
When Hama stops you at the entrance DISCARD all weapons including torches but not Gandalf s wizard staff
Enter the throne room and USE the staff or the spell COUNTERMAGIC to free Theoden of Grima s spell
RECRUIT Theoden Eomer and Hama
Now you must find the great treasures of the Golden Hall
But first go outside and get your weapons
Uh oh Anduril s gone
You will be able to get it back later
Go upstairs and into the armoury guarded by four Rohirrim EQUIP Aragorn with the magic sword and the others how you see fit
Go into Theoden s room south of Eowyn s and GET Herugrim
EQUIP Theoden with it
Then go into Grima s room be PERCEPTIVE and DETECT TRAPS Use DEVICES to disarm the trap
GET Helm s horn and all iron keys
Go upstairs and learn SWORDS RIDE BRAVADO CLIMB and PERCEPTION from Hambold
You can also be fed a gruel by a mute healer to heal you
Go upstairs once more
Once upstairs do not go north
There is an undisarmable trap there
PICK LOCK chest and read the papers
Go east then north until you can see an attic
Be PERCEPTIVE and COUNTERMAGIC Saruman away
GET the sceptre
Go back down to the throne room
Use PERCEPTION on the chair and then DETECT TRAPS
PICKLOCK the lock and GET the Cup of Rohan
Go downstairs into the dungeons
CLIMB into the well
GET the spiderbane
CLIMB out again
PERCEPT the spider near the chest and ATTACK it
When it is dead use PERCEPTION and DEVICE the trap
PICKLOCK the lock and GET the bridle
You have gained all the items
Leave the Golden Hall
When you enter the houses there will be different effects depending on whether you have King Theoden with you or not
Also when you ask people about him they often say nothing
I don t know if this is a bug or if they are speechless with shock anger grief hatred adoration sympathy reproachfulness ignorance or forgetfulness
Leave Edoras and head south west along the road
Take the smaller south path when it is available
Enter the first house for two mugs of ale and four rations In the second house there are two orcs
After fighting them GET the two rations the two ales and the sword
In the third house there is a man called Ethelden who acts very suspicious but I couldn t get anything out of him
In the fourth house there is nothing
Follow the path south and take the east path into the mountains
Frodo hiding from the Witch King Follow the path east and HIDE from the Witch King And you thought you killed him in Volume One
Gandalf at the Gate of the Dead Go into the east mountain passage and follow the path round
Meet Saruman and TALK to him to get rid of him
If you attempt to COUNTERMAGIC him or ATTACK him he will disappearand lightning will strike you
Keep going into Saruman s camp
Keep to the path until you reach the Gate of the Dead
A barrow wight will appear wielding Anduril
Luckily you don t have to fight him but the forced alternative is not much better
Eight orcs will attack and after they are dispatched eight uruks will appear
When they are finally dead Anduril and four healing draughts will be lying on the ground
GET them and EQUIP Aragorn with Anduril
TRADE the magic sword to Eomer and EQUIP him with it
Follow the path out and cross the bridge
Gandalf travelling to Hornburg Follow path and answer No to lighting a campfire
ATTACK the four orcs GET the rope and the two rations
Follow the path north
Go west at the junction as King Theoden says
A wounded soldier will die at your feet so GET his chain mail and sword
Attempt to cross the bridge ahead
Answer Yes to accept the help of three fine soldiers
Gandalf Hunting for the Lost Army of Erkenbrand Cross the west ford and talk to Elfhelm and his Rohirrim
Question him about NEWS ERKENBRAND and MESSENGER
Stay off the path to avoid blood thirsty Dunlands and Dunarchs Great names
The Dunlands wield swords the Dunarchs wield bows and both are fully shielded by leather armour
Also they tend to come in large groups of six or seven
So go very slightly north and a lot west until you are travelling along the feet of the mountains
When you hit the west mountain wall go south and kill the two orcarchs bow firing orcs and the four uruks guarding Erkenbrand and his tiny lost army
Luckily Erkenbrand s army will help you
Frodo on the Staircase Go north but not on the path
ATTACK the crow to silence it and avert the peril of the orcs
Now go up the staircase and CLIMB where it is hard to climb
It doesn t really matter whether you rest or not when you are asked
When you can see the cave north of you TRADE or DISCARD all of Gollum s stuff
Then TRADE and EQUIP Sam with the mithril and a shield
Make sure that he has the phial as well
Enter the cave
Aragorn the Subquests and Saruman s Defeat There are three completely unnecessary subquests that you can complete now Helm s Deep The Underground Passages of Isengard and The Mountains of Haryiarn
If you don t feel like adventuring and would rather just complete the game go to the section marked Defending Hornburg
Helm s Deep To enter Helm s Deep cross the little bridge that would otherwise lead straight into Hornburg and go north
GET any rocks lying about Continue north into the valley surrounded by mountains
Go west and then south
On the east side where the valley starts to narrow is a secret entrance but you don t need that yet
Go south and enter Helm s Deep
Once inside you must have Captain Hama with you to do anything interesting
Go west into a food storage room and PERCEPT Reof Question her about NEWS SECRET TOMB and GAUNTLET
Go south into the secret tomb
GET the gauntlet and ATTACK the ghost
Exit the tomb and then Helm s Deep
You may meet six orcs on the way and after they are dead you can GET their axe and ale
Go back to the riverbed and USE gianthands
GET the boulders
Back in Helm s Deep you can go south to interview the refugees
Question the woman about REOF NEWS BEAST and DRAGON
Hmm sounds like a quest
Go to the room west of the pond and GET elf rope and two rations
Go back to the tomb and PERCEPT the dangerous stalactites in the big room
Go north and kill the six orcs GET the sword and axe
The far north west dead end reveals a secret passage
CLIMB out
You are in the valley of the mountains
CLIMB back in for more adventure
Find the pool and dive in by answering Yes to the question
South east of the new pool is some rubble
PERCEPT and GET the gauntlet
There
You now have both gauntlets of the gods
Be PERCEPTIVE on the picture of a dragon attacking a village to discover their origin
Go back in the pool and then exit the tombs
Now go into the north east room and PERCEPT the hidden and broken elevator
Fix it with DEVICES and descend to the deeps of Helm s Deep
ATTACK the six bats in the west cavern if you want
In the north east passage a ghost of an ancient lord will tell you to beware victory
I am unsure of the identity of the ghost but I suppose it could be Helm
However I thought I killed Helm s ghost when I took the gianthands
There are many dead ends that have no secrets so eventually you will have to go south
Go east at the crossroads and ATTACK the six fire serpents After they are dead GET the magic mail silver pennies and the sword EQUIP someone with the magic mail I EQUIPPED Aragorn
Kill the seven bats to the south and GET the gem
Be sure you ve got your stamina up as you must now fight the Dragon
Go east into the big room
ATTACK the Dragon
It is impossible to kill and will take gigantic bites out of your health if you don t have chain mail or better
But once it is immobilised USE the gianthands or gauntlets to throw the Dragon into the pit
Then USE the boulder to seal the Dragon in forever
The Dragon is vanquished the woman s brothers avenged
The Underground Passages of Isengard These passages are very simple and could probably fit into the seventh level of Moria with no difficulty
Go north to Isengard and walk over to its east tower
PERCEPT a secret passage and descend beneath Isengard
DISCARD something so that you will be able to pick up some tree bark
All wooden doors can be opened by a PICKLOCK skill all silver doors with a supply key or Saruman s key
In the library there is some tree bark
GET this
Enter the armoury and EQUIP all you need In the bedroom there are three humans but after fighting them there is nothing to gain
There are loads of things in the storerooms torches flints knives rations ropes shovels etc but I won t talk you through these
Now go north west and go through the passage there READ the word Nazgul
Orcs may attack you in the large bedroom so I suggest you stick to the north or south walls
If you exit through the dead tree room or the north east passage you will find yourself in Fangorn
To get to the three north west rooms you must go through a room with an invisible pit
Stick to the walls like glue and it shouldn t pose a problem
The room you come to has just one uruk in it so the chain mail sword and supply key are easily won
The third room has some sort of strange brick trap which slides back into place the instant you walk in
Pretty safe trap I couldn t do anything with it Leave the Passages by the far south exit
Now you have rejoined Merry and PippinRECRUIT them both and go north into the centre of Isengard RECRUIT Quickbeam and go back out of Isengard
South west is an ent called Fastroot
TRADE him the tree bark for full health and two ent draughts
The Mountains of Dunland Behind Fastroot s tree is a path into the Mountains of Dunland
Take this as far as it goes
Talk to the old man if you want especially about ROHAN HARYIARN SARUMAN and EAGLES
Along the path some more are two Dunarchs and a Hiyalate
However only the Hiyalate seems to want to fight from this direction
Continue through the mountains until you reach an area where one of your group will warn of an avalanche USE rocks or boulders to stop the avalanche
Go south until the music changes
PERCEPT the evil eagle flying towards Isengard
When you come to a house you have reached Haryiarn
Stay away from the northern square because a mob of humans will order you to leave town
Walk between the houses and mountains to protect yourself
In the north western house is Toryin the Lorist
Question him about EAGLES and ROHAN
The west middle house contains nothing
The south west middle house has a silent shopkeep
The south west house has four Dunlands who dislike your kind and will attack you if you don t leave
The south east house has a silent bartender in the dining room and four fighters in the bedroom
The south east middle house has three Dunlands who will attack if you don t leave
The east middle house contains nothing
The north east house has Sargulk the Spy in it
CHARISMA him and question him about SARUMAN EAGLES and ORCS
You can either let him escape or ATTACK him
To enter the egg cache east of the village you need Gandalf to perform a COUNTERMAGIC spell
So come back later with Gandalf and for now exit the mountains by going south
PERCEPT the lone crow
Defending Hornburg Now go back to Hornburg the place which you were supposed to defend
In Hornburg there is a dwarf called Flamebeard who will give you two sets of chain mail
EQUIP those who need it
In the armoury they will give you what few weapons they have left
EQUIP those who need them
There is also a Rohirrim in the bar who will feed you some ale and rations If you enter the south west room you will see a message saying the battle has begun
Try to exit Hornburg
Fight off the two Dunarchs and the six orcs
Then go to the bridge and kill all six uruks
Answer Yes to defend the gatehouse and kill the five Dunlands and three Dunarchs Retreat to the Keep enter and USE Helm s Horn
Exit once more and refight the two Dunarchs and six orcs
In total you fought twelve orcs seven Dunarchs six uruks and five Dunlands
Well done
You have successfully defended Hornburg
Gandalf will join your party and tell you that you must now meet Saruman
On the way you can COUNTERMAGIC or FELAGUND the magic cache and go north round the hairpin at the mountain junction
You will then receive the word of power GWAIHIR which can transport you to Isengard Edoras Estemnet or Helm s Deep instantly
Quite useful but you don t have much time to use it
If on the path to Isengard you meet a band of Dunarchs and Dunlands who want an item of value TRADE all you can
I never found the item they wanted so maybe you should just avoid them
Isengard and Saruman s Tower In the walls of Isengard to be accessed only from the inside are lookout posts
In them going clockwise from the south are nothing four orcs and broken junk
In Saruman s Tower there are four humans who you can ATTACK and then GET Saruman s key from
Also there are three humans guarding an elf cloak a magic sword and an elf brooch in a seemingly empty room
EQUIP Eomer with the magic sword
Upstairs you can learn READ BRAWL DARK LORE DETECT TRAPS and WIZARD LORE in the library
There is also a human saying his prayers
Go upstairs once more
EDRO open in elfish the big locked doors and ATTACK the two corrupt eagles inside
GET the two eagle eggs and the healing draught and notice you have learnt the word of power MANWE
There are two things you can do from here
Go upstairs and where it refers you to a paragraph either CLIMB or say MANWE
GET the palantir

See Saruman in the north east room and COUNTERMAGIC his spell binding words
GET the palantir
You have now freed Edoras and the surrounding kingdoms of the threat of the White Hand
But a more important quest remains Frodo in the Last Cave Go deeper Hey
Gollum s gone
USE Sting or star ruby to cut through the webs
Uh oh
The Ringbearer is gone
And now Gollum attacks you
Now you know why Gollum should be disarmed and Sam strengthened
Beat Gollum not too hard and then USE the phial on Shelob
Head towards your friend and listen to the orcs
Phew
Frodo s just unconscious
But he is being taken away by the orcs

Lost Horizon Walkthrough by ronrob Game Play Notes In the opening menu the four windows and the middle door are used as labeled
The street sign at the right is used to Quit the game
In the lower right corner of the game screen The magnifying glass shows all hot spots

The icon right of the magnifying glass summarizes where you are and tasks to be done
The icon on the far right goes to the main menu
When you run your cursor over a hot spot you will see an eye and or a hand
The eye means you can look at the spot which you do by right clicking
The hand indicates an action you perform by left clicking
When you pick up an inventory item you should always look at it in inventory
Sometimes doing so will produce one or more additional inventory items
You can combine inventory items by left clicking an item to pick it up and then left clicking it again over another item
Left clicking anywhere on the screen moves your character to that spot
As a general rule you really ought to look eye at every hot spot
That said I will not always refer to hot spots that don rsquo t significantly advance the game
When you first arrive at a scene it is a good idea to look at absolutely everything
Sometimes you get a hand icon but there is nothing you can do yet
Write down what it is and where it is located because there is a high probability that you will need it eventually

Look at the left door and knock
The door is answered by Kim Wuang rsquo s niece
Wuang died just a few days ago
You and Kim argue over the event in which the workers were killed
Kim feels that you betrayed Wuang
You ask about Wuang rsquo s maps and notes but Kim is still hostile toward you especially when you say that you can rsquo t tell her why you need them
Suddenly Tong bursts in and holds a gun on Kim
Recall that Tong is working for the German agent who wants Wuang rsquo s maps and notes
Kim uses some martial arts to disarm Tong
You look outside to see that two of Tong rsquo s thugs are out front
Kim explains that Richard was here several weeks ago and took copies of Wuang rsquo s maps
Kim agrees to give you one last chance
Take thehangerfrom the wardrobe on the left and combine it with the bamboo rod to get a pole with hook
Come down to the other room and go out the door to the balcony
Use the pole with hook to get the yellowlanternabove you
Go out to the hallway and hang the lantern on the hook by the door
Now you can see a small window high up on the back wall

Sayonara Baby
Your Office You finally manage to persuade Kim that she must leave with you for her own safety
Off they go toward Tibet
Flight to Tibet You explain what happened at the workers rsquo riot
Your saving Richard caused a breakdown of order
Richard pulled strings to keep you out of jail but someone had to be blamed
You explain the purpose of your mission to Tibet
Your thought of dropping Kim off while you continue on is an entirely rejected
Suddenly a German fighter starts shooting at you
Get rid of the fighter Take thepumpkin thebag of flour thecannister and theparachute
Make a hole in the pumpkin by banging it against the fixture on the right wall
Use the cannister and the bag of flour on the pumpkin
Open the door and use the pumpkin on the German fighter
The fighter goes down but not before it fires into your starboard engine
Worse the fire shreds the wing
You take the plane down for a crash landing
German Camp That same German soldier reports that the originals of Wuang rsquo s maps and notes are likely to be in the hands of the niece Kim who is being protected by a soldier you
The scientist wants information about you and Kim and wants to know why you wanted the maps
The soldier also reports the disappearance of one of their aircraft
The scientist wants a search and recovery effort and the removal of all traces that might lead back to the camp
Chapter Two The Secret in the Mountains Tibet You regain consciousness near the crash site
You call to Kim who is still in the cockpit of the plane leaning against a cliff
Your first priority is to help her out of the crashed airplane but you can rsquo t reach her from here
Take thesledand the propellerblade
You can rsquo t open the crate so use the blade on it to get the lid
Use the crate to get a thehornof a phonograph player and abroken record
Take the path to the left to approach a chasm and see the crashed German fighter on the other side
Obviously you would like to get over there but you can rsquo t just jump
The hill behind you looks like a ski slope
Do you dare
Use the lid on the sled to make asled with cover
Look at the smooth rock near the edge of the chasm and realize that there is no snow there
There is a snow drift at the right edge of the screen
Use the horn to gather snow and spread it on the smooth rock
Place the sled on the furrow in the slope
Wheeee
Of course there is the problem of getting back
The wing is overhanging the chasm
Pick it up and use it on the chasm to push it across
Use the blade to open the cover of the wing that is buried vertically in the snow
Remove thewing hullthat looks a bit like a ladder
Look in the cockpit and get ajacketandbinoculars
Cut open the jacket with the broken record to get alambskinand adocument
Read the text of the document and look at the two seals
The document seems to indicate permission for and expedition to be here and some immunity
The seals suggest that the expedition is sponsored by the Thule Society and that it has the blessing of the Tibet government
Take a look at the puddle beneath the aircraft and at the fire
Then had back across the wing over the chasm to your own crash area
Go up the path beside the cliff
You are met by an argali a kind of mountain sheep
Note the altar the incense sticks and weird lumps but you can rsquo t get past the argali
Place the lambskin on the sled and then place the folding table on the sled
This creates afake sheep
Use the fake sheep on the argali to entice it into attacking
Pick up thehorn and leather strap
Look at the horn and leather strap to separate thehornand theleather strap
Go to the altar and take theincense sticks
Pick up the weird lumps that are actuallyargali dung
Go back down the path and left to the German fighter crash site
Try to burn the argali dung in the fire
Place the dung in the phonograph player horn and try again to get a horn full ofburning argali dung Dip the leather strap in the puddle
The wet strap freezes into afrozen leather strap
Return to your crash site and use the wing hull that looks like a ladder on the ledge at the right
Use the ledge again to climb up there
At last you have reached Kim but she is unconscious
You need to revive her
Light an incense stick by sticking it into the burning argali dung
Use the burning incense on Kim
You try to remove the cockpit cover but to no avail
Note the parachute at the upper right corner of the screen
Use the frozen leather strap to retrieve theparachute Place the parachute on the cockpit and then use the parachute
You hold a long conversation with the increasingly complaining Kim but you eventually get around to the Professor Hayes expedition accompanied by Kim rsquo s uncle Wuang
Wuang rsquo s note seem to indicate a monastery near here but you can rsquo t read the text
Listen to and see Kim rsquo s translation of Wuang rsquo s notes about the expedition
Wuang and Hayes had found a dead monk in a cave along with a partially burned map of the region
The map included the word ldquo Khambalung rdquo with which Hayes was familiar
It referred to a valley shrouded in myths and in which there was an ancient monastery no one had ever found
The monastery was said to be guarded by monks to protect a secret
In the hand of the dead monk was an artifact that resembled the ldquo eye of the dragon rdquo Hayes took the artifact
The notes go on to say that Hayes and Wuang tried to find the Khambalung Valley but the weather thwarted them Hayes drew a crude map
You believe that finding the monastery is your only chance
Suddenly you see an army truck driving below
You decide to follow the truck
You arrive at a German military camp
You can rsquo t imagine what they are doing her but of course we know that it is a large scale expedition to the monastery
Through the binoculars you see a British prisoner
You must free the prisoner
German military camp You are hiding beside a barracks building
As always look around at everything
Walk to the far right and look at the sign
Oops
Switch to Kim Fenton will need some help from you
Take anewspaper theropethat runs horizontally along the right side of the truck and thesignthat also includes alog
Look at the crate in the truck and take thepot thetape and thegas burner
Pass all these items except for the sign and documents down through the crevice to Fenton
Go back to the side of the barracks and cover the holes in the snow with the sign
Pick up thecigarthat was thrown out the window and send it down to Fenton
Switch to Fenton You can try the far right passageway but it just loops around
Try the second passageway from the left but you decide it is futile although you do feel a draft that might indicate a way out
Light the gas burner with the cigar and use the gas burner on an incense stick
Use the incense stick on the second from the left passageway and see the smoke being pulled by the draft into the left passageway
Go into the left passageway to a cave with a pile of rubbish
Take thepocket knifefrom the base of the pile
Place the newspaper on the pile of rubbish
Put the ice in the pot and seal the pot with the tape
Use the pocket knife corkscrew on the log to bore a hole
You get awood chipas a result
Plug the pot with the wood chip
Light the newspaper with the gas burner and place the pot on the fire
Now you have a hole in the ceiling of ice
Retrieve thepot
Attach the rope to the broken horn to create agrappling hook
Use the grappling hook on the crevice in the ceiling and then use the grappling hook to climb out
Now you have gone farther into the camp
You see the tent where the prisoner is kept
Look at the case to your left open it and take ahand grenade
Walk to the right in the direction of the tent but there is a welder who might see you
Look around at everything
Put the pot in the vent of the generator shed
The water short circuits the generator
When the welder enters the shed kick the beam holding the hood of the truck to trap the welder inside the shed
Try to open the toolbox but the lid is jammed
Enter the tent and see Thomas a man you know is from Richard rsquo s unit
The German is too big to handle
Pick up thetent pegfrom the boxes and exit Go back to the toolbox and use the tent peg on it
You get avice someglue and asaw blade in a cover
Getting rid of the guard Apply glue to the broken record and assemble the pieces
The light cracks would be detected
Use the vice on the hand grenade to getblack powderand use the powder on the record
Look at the saw blade with cover to remove thesawbladeand get acover
Use glue on the cover and apply the newspaper to the glued cover
Finally place the record in the cover
Go back inside the tent and place your record on the pile of other records
The guard changes records and it blows up knocking out the guard
Talk to Thomas and learn what happened as shown in the introductory scenes
Discuss everything
Thomas says that trucks leave frequently so that might be your way out
Take the soldier rsquo sjacketand also get somekeysand atape reel
Use the keys on Thomas to remove the handcuffs
Thomas can rsquo t walk and he is depicted in your inventory
Exit the tent and follow the tracks up to the truck
Place Thomas in the back
You are confronted by the truck dispatcher
You can rsquo t take the truck without filling out a form that can be found in the radio room
Use the keys on the door of the radio building at the left and enter
Pick up thepencilfrom the floor
Place the tape reel on the tape recorder to hear a report of the interrogator
It sounds as though ldquo Object quot would be sufficiently important for the dispatcher to release the truck
Look at the list on the left wall and see that Object is the ldquo Eye of the Kanjur rdquo Take aformfrom the desk and use the pencil on it
Select ldquo Eye of the Kanjur rdquo from the list on the right
Exit the radio room and head straight upward past the right side of the truck Give the form to the dispatcher in the window
He sends you on your way and Kim jumps aboard
Monastery You Kim and Thomas arrive at the base of the monastery mountain
Kim again insists on remaining with you
Thomas heads for India
Use the tent peg to remove thesignsfrom the post behind you
Use the lever to see what it does
Talk to the petulant Kim and get her help
You raise her up to the bucket where she finds somewooden planksandbaking powder
Take the path up to the monastery
You overhear the changing of the guard
Look in the bird rsquo s nest and take theegg shell
Return to the crossroads lower left corner of the screen and use the eggs shell to collect someoilfrom the puddle beneath the lift
Go back to the monastery
The small bridge is booby trapped with trip wires and grenades
Use a plank with the drain along the lower right side of the bridge and another plant with the dragon rsquo s claw
Look at and try to take the prayer wheel that is right of the door
Use the tent peg to dislodge theprayer wheel It appears to be some kind of universal magnet
See a gap left of the door
Use the tent peg to remove the rock and reveal a wooden wheel
Use one of the road signs on the wooden wheel and then turn the wheel
Repeat with the other three signs
You have raised the door
Enter and see the courtyard that is guarded by a dog
Look around at everything
Try the pulley beside you but it is rusty and noisy
Use the egg shell of oil on it
Now raise the pulley
There is a tin below so this is a good time to test the magnetic properties of the prayer wheel
Attach it to the pulley and lower it to get thetin
Use the trusty tent peg on the tin to open it and get somedisgusting meat
Drop the meat to the wooden slab
When the dog fetches it the knapsack slides to the end of the slab
Use the pulley to hoist theknapsack
Look in the knapsack to get agas mask acanteen acompass and atorch
Get rid of the guard dog Use some glue on the torch and then attach the compass to the torch
Use the modified torch on the dog kennel to attract the dog into the kennel
Look at the canteen to drink the contents
Place the baking powder in the canteen and use the lid on the foaming canteen
Toss the canteen to the snow drift above the dog kennel
Look at the use the shadow of the western wall
Look at the strange chest
Use it to obtain a wiring puzzle
Select your difficulty level
The objective is to insert the plugs on the right to correspond with the placement of the plugs on the left
When you succeed the lights come on
Look at the wall and see that there are three ornamental plates
Try the prayer wheel on them but only the far right one has any effect
Look inside and see a mosaic of two dragons
Use the mosaic to get another puzzle again with a difficulty level choice
Hint The top tile of the center column is the one with the distinctive brown fins
Enter the secret chamber the one where we last saw Richard
Look around to find Richard rsquo s belt pack and look at the strange symbols
You recognize the symbols from Wuang rsquo s notes
Ask Kim whether she can translate the symbols
Kim reads the symbols as meaning that there are two keys to the sleeping dragon
The Eye of the Dragon is one of course but the second is hidden away somewhere else
Using the Eye of the Dragon on a map will reveal the second key rsquo s hiding place
The conclusion is that the maps and the Eye of the Dragon are probably with Hayes
To find Richard you need to find Hayes
Countess von Hagenhild arrives with a squad and says that Hayes is in Marrakesh
Listen to her fiendish plans for getting the eye from Hayes and for reviewing the Piri Reis map in the ldquo museum rdquo When you are led out you escape and eventually jump into the truck that is taking Kim to the camp
In the process a rocket is launched that sets off an avalanche that hurls the truck far down a snow slope
Poor Kim
People are still firing at you so you run off
Note We are asked to make a leap of faith here
Somehow Fenton has traveled on foot miles to Lhasa where he catches a flight to Casablanca and then a train to Marrakesh
Pretty good for a guy who never has any money
Chapter Three Race Against Time Marrakesh You locate Hayes rsquo shop but he is in jail for not paying taxes
Mr Lacoste is in the shop for the courts to inventory Hayes rsquo goods
He tells you how to get to the jail
Go up through the arch to the bazaar and then through the north exit at the upper left corner
Take thecrank handlefrom atop the well
Enter the jail
The jail officer won rsquo t let you talk to Hayes but Hayes can be released with a bail of francs
Exit the jail and you are hailed by Hayes from his cell window
You discuss the Tibet expedition and Wuang rsquo s role
You explain what has been happening with you and he is astonished that you actually found the Khambalung Valley
You tell him about Kim rsquo s translations and about how the Eye of the Dragon can be used with a map to find the second key
Hayes reveals that he has the Eye of the Dragon
The second key will take you to Shambala which is also the goal of the Nazis
Hayes rsquo heart is acting up and he asks you to find his heart medicine back at the shop
He will say nothing more about the Eye of the Dragon until he has his heart medicine and is released on bail
He gives you aringfor seed money
You now have two tasks Get the heart medicine and raise francs for Hayes rsquo bail
Return to Hayes rsquo shop and go to the rear
See the small case on the shelf
Talk with Lacoste
He can rsquo t give the case to you but he gives you aformfor requesting a waiver
It must be stamped
Leave the shop and return to the jail
Naturally the officer does not have the authority to stamp the form
Your two tasks will take some creativity
It rsquo s time to look around
Return to the alley and talk with the snake charmer
He tells you that his flute can be used with camels
Follow the discussion thread about the flute
He offers to lend the flute to you but first you have to bring him something to drink
Come down and talk with the jeweler in red
Discuss the ring Hayes gave you and the jeweler offers francs for it
He bumps it up to francsalong with acouponfor a free repair or polish
Go back to the bazaar and leave through the right arch to the desert
The sign warns against proceeding without a guide
The sign at the tent says that the guide is on a break
Look at the sparkling crystals but you can rsquo t break them off
Use the well crank on them and take acrystal
Also take somehayfrom the trough
Return to the alley and give the crystal to the jeweler
You use your coupon to have the crystal polished
The jeweler returns with thepolished quartz
Now it rsquo s time to distract the jail guard
Return to the jail
Place the polished quartz in the crank holder above the well
Place the hay in the ray of light
The jail officer rushes out to put out the fire
Talk to Hayes but he can rsquo t reach the stamp on the desk
Pass the well crank through the cell window and Hayes gets thestamp
Use the stamp on the form
Return to the rear of Hayes rsquo shop and give the stamped form to Lacoste
Take thesmall case return to the jail and use the small case on the cell window
Hayes returns the case that also contains agold detector
Use the well crank on the small case to break off theknob
Use the gold detector on the knob to learn that it is gold coated
Return to the bazaar and talk with the green grocer
Use your francs to buy ahalf melon
Use the well crank on the melon to get amelon rind
Go left to the dyer rsquo s shop and look at everything
Note especially the clean water
Use the melon rind on the water with the dyer rsquo s permission of course to get amelon rind with water
Return to the alley and give the water to the snake charmer
He gives hisfluteto you
Return to the bazaar and look at the poster on the right of the arch to the desert
Go out to the desert and use the flute on the camel beside the tent in the distance
After the camel arrives by a circuitous route try to use the camel
He won rsquo t move
However you should be safe if you follow the camel tracks
Use the camel tracks and at the map select the Berber fairgrounds
You talk with the man in blue and learn that beating Aziz in wrestling would give you a prize of francs
You also learn that you can rsquo t enter the festival unless you are wearing a blue djellaba
He gives you agarment ticketthat will allow you to rent a djellaba at the bazaar
Return to the bazaar and give the garment ticket to the cloth merchant
After much talk and haggling select thewhite djellaba
Go talk with the dyer
Eventually you can ask him whether he can dye your djellaba blue
Of course he is out of blue dye and is waiting for indigo
You can go to the oasis and get the indigo yourself
He gives youflatbreadfor the caravan master
Return to the desert and at the map select the oasis
Talk to the nomad give him the flatbread and receive abag of indigo
Note the shrub with the white flowers
Go back to the city and dyer
Give the indigo to him and you get theblue djellaba
Return to the desert and the Berber fairgrounds
Talk with the man in blue and then enter the shaman rsquo s tent at the far left
By the end of the game you will realize how prophetic the shaman is Talk about everything and learn about thorn apple seeds that taken immoderately can have serious consequences
Enter the wrestling tent and talk with the promoter
Accept the challenge
Naturally you lose but recall that Aziz began by taking a drink from the bucket
Go back to the desert and to the oasis
Take athorn apple blossomfrom the shrub
Now go back to the Berber fairgrounds and the wrestling tent
Try to place the thorn apple in the bucket but you wait until the promoter is looking the other way
The thorn apple goes into the bucket automatically
Talk to the promoter and accept the challenge
Sure enough Aziz drinks from the bucket and you win francs
Return to the city and to the thimblerigger rsquo s stand
This is the old monte con game and you will fail in trying to increase your francs
You can go ahead and try if you wish
It will cost you only francs
Note that the ball looks just like your gold ball
Use the gold ball on the stand
The con artist agrees to use your ball
After he shuffles the cups use your gold detector on the cups to locate the correct one
You win
Accept a rematch and follow the same procedure
You win again and the con artist gives up
Go to the jail and talk with the guard
Hayes is released
The two of you sit in a caf where Hayes tells a long tale
The bottom line is that the Eye of the Dragon which Hayes has is of no use without the keeper rsquo s map
Only with both can the second artifact be found
Hayes refers to the Piri Reis map the same one mentioned by the Countess
It is in the Berlin museum
At Hayes rsquo shop he produces the Eye of the Dragon but Nazis shoot him and abscond with the Eye
Hayes rsquo dying words are that you must prevent the Nazis from reaching Shambala
The scene shifts to the Governor rsquo s Palace where Lord Weston receives a telegram from Thomas
Curiously he burns the telegram
Chapter Four Into the Lion rsquo s Den Berlin Museum You spotted the Countess entering the museum to examine the Piri Reis map
Look at the advertising pillar and take the cameraposter
Look at and try the drainage grate
Enter the museum and talk with the maintenance man
The exhibits are closed right now

The organ grinder has a hat that you might be able to use
You can come back to this later
Pariser Platz Go to the city and Pariser Platz
Of course the IOC accreditation office is closed
Add a press pass to the list of things you need to get
Baltus Edison the man at the table strikes up a conversation
He is a journalist who hates sports
What he really wants to cover is some big story about romance in the royal family
Edison receives a phone call from his editor who is pushing for his Olympics story
Look at Edison rsquo s jacket to see his glasses and press pass
There is room for mischief here
Look in the pram and see a child with a lollipop
Try to take it but the child whimpers
Look at the dried flowers in inventory to get awire
Use the wire on the helium filled glove and attach the balloon animal to the pram
Pick up thelollipopthat the frightened child tosses away
Take thenapkinfrom the empty table and use it on the ketchup
Look at and talk with the tourist

You get hishat
Use the lollipop on the whiskers and then talk to the stadium guard again
Now you are done with your explanation to Glenn of how you got in here
You tell Glenn about your need to get into the museum
He agrees to get you in provided he wins the decathlon which is in doubt
Huber is the better long jumper
The margin is centimeters
If he wins by that much Glenn will lose the gold medal
After Glenn leaves for the event you decide to figure out how to rig the results
Walk up the steps out to the stadium
You watch the procedure for a long jump
Look at everything especially the tape measure which might be the heart of the matter

She is angered that the Piri Reis map was moved to the Wewelsburg Castle in the middle of the city
She denies being a member of the Thule Society although she is paid by them
She gives an important bag to the battalion leader
Watch the door by which he exits
You are certain that the bag contains the Eye of the Dragon but you will have to go to the Wewelsburg Castle for the Piri Reis map
The scientists run a test on a jet propulsion engine and then go to check the conduits
Try the red box and you get thehandlethat broke off
Recall the display case in the foyer with no lock
Go back there try the handle and take apiton

Note I suggest you save here in case you want to start over with the mine maze
Mine Enter the mine
Take a short step or two right and you see a railroad track
Follow the track although this requires some guesswork
Take very short steps for best success
The track dips down southeast for a while and then back up northeast
Eventually you will come to a junction with a track heading down
Keep going east to another junction with another track going down
Go past that junction also
The track you are on makes a turn south

You are greeted by the Countess and a large band of soldiers
Because you found the key you are the only who can use it
Naturally you dig in your heels until the Countess produces Kim
You capitulate and place the key in the pillar
When you awake you see Richard in a ghostlike form
When Richard used the key he was transported to Shambala of the past
Richard gives an explanation of what Shambala is
The surviving priests of the past set up a force shield to protect the center of Shambala
Only a certain amulet will provide access
The amulet is divided into three pieces and are hidden in the temples of three priest castes
Richard will be needed to stop the Nazis from disrupting the force field
The pieces of the amulet were not yet hidden in Richard rsquo s time but he can help you find them
Chapter Seven The Heart of the World You and Richard must team up to locate the three pieces of the amulet
Because Richard is in the past his actions will affect you in the present but not the other way around
Thus it makes sense to begin with Richard
Switch to Richard Note It is especially important that you look at everything in every scene and make notes about places where the hand icon appears but no action is yet possible Use the pile of shards and get anut
Open the stone slab beneath the center stone head and take thewooden gear

BUT HARD ONE GAME BOOMER'S Hints Cheats and Walkthroughs
Lost in Time Walk Through By oldmariner Cocktel Vision re released by Sierra
Win dos will play in modern pc rsquo s with Dosbox
On XP with Dosbox the game ran smoothly without any issues
The cd must be in the drive and properly mounted in Dosbox per Dosbox instructions
There appears to be many of these games available through Amazon and Half dot com resellers from under three dollars and up
I did not encounter any dead ends or ways for the main character to be killed as is common with these old games
It is completely mouse driven with inventory puzzles
There are two timed puzzles toward the end of the game where you should save before attempting them
It is a story driven game with minimal dialogue and no conversation tree
Cut scenes are used to advance the story and explain some events
You can click past the cut scenes but not viewing them will leave questions about the events
The game is in first person with frequent close up views of your character during game play
Part I The Briscarde You awake as Doralice aboard a ship not knowing how you got there or what to do
A word about the interface using the opening scene screen shot
When you move your curser to the top of the screen you see six icons
They are from left to right control panel hints notebook inventory map options
You can also access your inventory with a right click and a second right click to close
The save game and quit commands are in the control panel
The black area on the bottom of the screen is where the sub titles descriptions conversations and subtitles are printed
In Dosbox you can toggle in and out of full screen using the alt enter keys
You will discover Doralice is the original Macguyver as the puzzles are quite ingenious and logical
You start by clicking on the stool directly in front of you to see a nail on its underside
Using your pliers in inventory you can take the nail
You can also click on the poster which you will interact with in a few minutes but you need to do a few things first
Turn left to see a chest and barrels
You will discover the chest is locked and will have to come back to open it later
Search the barrels to find and take a lantern
Turn left again and you see more barrels and a bucket with water in it
Go forward to the barrels click on them
It is dark you are told so use the lantern on the barrels
Take the sponge and drop it into the bucket of water and then retrieve the soaked sponge
You may have to rewet the sponge as it might dry up when you attempt to use it
If you try to go down the opening Doralice will say it is dark again use the lantern on the opening and go down
Click twice on the cast in front of you to find a bottle of oil
Turn right twice to see a flooded section and a pump
Click on the pump handle it won rsquo t move
Use the oil on the handle then use the handle to pump out the water
Turn left and see to the left of the stairs there ia a chain
Click on the chain and in close up take the corkscrew
Go upstairs back to the hold
You may have to rewet the sponge
Use the wet sponge on the poster to remove it
You will see a knot on the wall look close then use your corkscrew on the knot
Look again at the hole you created and watch a cut scene
You are given a knife during the cut scene
Go back to the location of the water bucket and use the knife on the post then climb up
As each new location is reached it will be added to your map which you can use for instant travel
Check the door straight ahead you cannot open it
Turn right twice there are three racks of pins with one rack missing a pin
Make sure you have highlighted a pin and not the rack
Use your pliers to take a pin
Go toward the back of the ship two screens turn left
Take a towel from middle bucket behind post
Continue to the back of ship turn left and use towel on the ring turn right to see you have opened the recess in the wall
Click on recess in close up take the soap from the enclosure you opened
Turn right again to see a dark spot on the wall click on it
In close up you see it is a cannonball
Still in close up very hard to see in lower left is an oar click again to take it Turn right to see a trap door you can rsquo t do anything with now
Go forward two clicks turn right
Use the soap on the rusted cannon on the floor to get soap shavings
Turn left go to the back of the ship to the sliding door
Use the soap shavings on the bottom of the door
Now you can open it by clicking on the handle
Watch cut scene end of part one
Part Manor de la Prunliere You are transported back to present time at the manor At the gate look at the horse then the tractor
Click on the cab and in close up you se a basket on the roof
Click on it to take an apple which you give to the horse so he will leave the gate
There is a note on the gate read it and you will retain a dart
Again in close up of the tractor you take a battery and see a tool box
There are three items in the tool box three clicks and you have cigarettes a foil packet a match box and a metal pipe
Click again on the gate and see a lock in close up
The use of inventory is a bit different than other games I will illustrate with a screen shot of the gate where you are first required to mix inventory items to create a multiple inventory action
This is consistent in the game each time you must mix inventory items
This is a close up view of the lock with the pipe having been selected from inventory
Note the curser appears as the pipe and the options panel is highlighted
Once you select the pipe from inventory scroll to the top of the screen to highlight your option icons
Using the pipe click on the inventory icon
Your inventory opens with the pipe as your curser as seen below
You then select the battery to mix the pipe with the battery
You cannot highlight one item in the inventory and move it to another as done in modern games
You now have a pipe filled with battery acid click that on the lock to open the gate
Go forward past the well to the door
Click on the handle it breaks off and you have a handle in your inventory
Look at the keyhole to see the key is in there
Take the picture from above the door
You will have a picture and wire added to inventory
Use the dart on the keyhole to knock key to the floor
No we won rsquo t slide it out on a paper
The solution is far more ingenious
Go to the front yard the exit to the back yard is above the window left of the front of the house
Click on it and see two buildings the light house and a strange building
Go to the light house you cannot open the door
Go right to the north side of the light house
Click on the bottle to take the vinegar
The barrel is heavy use the dart on cork you see on the barrel
Now take the barrel
Go to the east side of the building then to the back yard and click on the strange building
Use the portrait from inventory on the hole you see in the steps
Click on the portrait and set the dials to
The numbers derived by subtracting one year from the other then click the cross
It will activate the elevator which has no power
Use the map to go back to the manor
Now we get creative
Take your handle click the inventory icon and click the handle on the wire in inventory
Put the handle away
Take the vinegar bottle and use it with the battery to energize it
Use the battery with the handle coil then use the new electro magnet on the space under the door
She will automatically put the handle in the door use the key and enter
Take the oar from the left wall
Click on a small box in the near corner the lamp is sitting on it
Click a second time to take a wire and open the door
Take the resin and see a fuse which you cannot take
Instead use the foil you have in inventory on the fuse
She will automatically place the fuse in the proper slot
This provides electricity to the elevator
Take the fire extinguisher from behind the trunk next to the fireplace In close up take the roasting spit from the fireplace
Turn to your left take the rod leaning against the wall and place it on the fireplace it won rsquo t stay on the andirons
Make sure your subtitle says fireplace and not andirons
The game is picky that way
Using your map go to the vault elevator site
Enter elevator press the center button
Place the barrel from inventory on the ground click on it
She will climb up and take a bottle of cider
Find a cork in inventory by highlighting the bottle of cider
Select the cork and use it on the can you see on the beam above the lantern
Take the can of rust remover your cork ended up in the well
We will get that later
Go to the light house using your map then to the north side
Use the roasting spit to break the window to get a hose
Go to the east side of the light house facing the door
Attach the hose to the handle note once you do that the hose end still appears in inventory
Go to the vault using your map
Standing below the steps you see a gray spot on the right side of the elevator it is identified as a railing click the hose end on it
From the same position at the bottom of the steps you see another gray area on the left side identified as the control panel
Click on that to send the elevator down
You see the action opens the light house door and you are left with a broken hose
Go to the light house
Go upstairs take the notebook from the left drawer of the desk
It will go to your notes file not the inventory
Take the paint remover from the right drawer
Then use your oar to open to open the dresser to get the razor
Take the telescope from the desk look through it by clicking on it
Change the view by moving your mouse don lsquo t click
This is rather difficult and may take more than one try sliding that mouse around
When you see this view click on the close up circle to get a enlarged view as shown below
The combinations are random as you can see you have a canon ball with a yellow background a sword with a yellow background and a canon with a yellow background
Almost any combination may appear
The three symbols can very in order and the background can have different colors
You need the exact order and color to solve the puzzle in the vault
Make a note of symbol color and the order as they appear left to right based on what you find in your game
Go upstairs look at the curtains click on them to climb up and get kerosene
Now use the razor on the curtains to obtain a rag
Go down to the first floor there is a hard to see wooden shoe on a lower step take it find a key inside it in inventory
Use the key on the door and you will go through to the outside
Go back in and see a small window just inside the door click on window to get shard of glass
Go through to the outside again
Open the valve wheel you see on the upper left side of screen
Use paint remover on the algae on the lower right
Now use glass shard on algae to discover a mechanism
Use your roasting spit on the mechanism followed by the rust remover
You can now turn the spit to open the gate
Look at the boat then use your map to go to the vault
Inside see the trunk click on it to get close up view
To do this puzzle remember the order of the combinations you saw through the telescope
The sword a knife The cannonball a bullet and the canon a gun Using the buttons top and bottom click in the color and weapon in proper order left to right
Take the fiber glass and the ships log
The log goes to notes
The fiber glass to inventory
Go to the well using your map
Connect your leaky hose to the faucet then look at the hose in close up
Put the fiber glass on the hose then use the resin on the fiber glass in close up
Remain in close up view of the repaired hose click to take the hose end
Then put it in the well
If the water is not turned on do that now to watch the well fill up
You can now take the cork out of the well Use map to go back to basement of the light house
Click on the boat and in close up view use the shoe to bail out the water
Place the piece of curtain in the hole and then put the cork on the rag and hole
Use the oar on the boat and watch the cut scene
Part The Fisherman's Cabin Enter the cabin open the cabinet take the boat in the bottle open the cabinet again and take the bottle of sauce
There is a basket on the table click on it three times to get a hanker chief bread and nail while rejecting a sweater that does not fit
Move chair then stand on it to get the chandelier
Use the nail you have in inventory on the top of the chandelier chain in close up
Click on the chandelier in inventory to separate parts
Go outside and look at the roof to see a buoy Use the sauce on the bread then throw it onto the roof
The gulls will knock the buoy onto the steps as they go after the bread
Use the razor on the fallen buoy to obtain a rope then attach the rope to your chandelier anchor
Throw that on the cliff you see to the right of the screen
It is implied that you climbed the cliff via the rope
You are auto returned to the well by your front door
Use the map to travel to the basement of the light house
Pick up the barrel which has all the things you left behind when you went boating
Go back to the well Click on the well to get a close up view
You can then use the razor on the repaired hose which will allow you to obtain a blunt instrument she calls a club
It is a piece of hose
If you have not done so pick up a log next to the front door of the manor then go inside Use kerosene on hanker chief
Put the log into fireplace and then put in the hanker chief
Sometimes the game will not allow you to do this in reverse order
It seems to want the log first
In close up view of the fire place use the club on the ship in the bottle both in inventory
She needs the match inside the bottle
Use match in inventory on cigarette box to light it then use lit match on log
Doralice notices the rod expands from the heat of the fire
When you exit close up you see a flagstone on the floor in front of the fireplace
Place the barrel you have in inventory on the flagstone
Then hit it with your club which opens the barrel
You see a hole in the side of the barrel place candle on hole to plug it
At first this was a bit confusing the club removed the lid from the barrel and did not create the hole you plugged with the candle
It took me awhile to get that idea
Take the wooden shoe use it on the trunk which is filled with sand the game will ask what you should do with it
Click the shoe on the barrel and she will auto fill the barrel with sand
The added weight on the flagstone opens a panel in the wall
Go through the new doorway and find yourself back on the ship
How did we make that leap
Supposedly a tunnel led to the wrecked ship and you traveled through it
How you did not get wet exiting the tunnel and entering the ship I don rsquo t know
Look at the mast in front of you and take the pliers
Place the wooden floats on the floor near the box
Use the copper wire in inventory with the electrical wire on the box
Use the pliers to cut the electrical wire
Use your pipe on the puddle to the left to fill it
Then in close up of the box use the pipe on the lock to wet it

Using the map go back to the mid deck
Go forward turn right and enter closet
In inventory use the pliers on the nail to bend it
Connect the oar with the ribbon and then connect the wooden pin to that combination in inventory
Then take the bent nail adding it to your oar ribbon pin construction to make a boat hook
Use the boat hook to pull the halyard hanging in front of you
The halyard is the rope you see in the picture below

You get the message ldquo under Galipo rdquo Put the bowl under Galipo and then the paint remover and salts on the bowl
Sometimes the game reports ldquo floor rdquo instead of ldquo under Galipo rdquo this works as well
This will create acid fumes and a brief scene showing the bird going into the cage
