Take the stick from the ground near the base of the smiling tree and pick the lowest hanging fruit from the tree
Enter the barn you can take the little keg off the dog's back Talking to the cat and dog reveals that the only way to leave this place is through the NiteMare which is well hidden
Leave the barn and go northwest to the castle
Inside the castle you'll meet Lissa who's literally the girl of your dreams
She tells you that the way to the NiteMare and the Dragon that you'll have to fight is near the tree where you picked the strange fruit
Go back to the barnyard and head east to the Forest of Emotion
Follow the path east
Search the pile of rocks to find a bottle of pills
Take the bottle and talk to BoneHead and CementHead
They tell you the way to the NiteMare is up the mountain but the log is blocking the path
Head back to the barnyard
Take the pills by the base of the cinnamon fruit tree
The label on the bottle reads fully SHRINKING AND GROWING PILLS
USE ONLY AS DIRECTED
MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO PREGNANT WOMEN
You'll shrink small enough that you can walk around in the grass at the base of the tree
Go farther up the tree to where the mouth is
You can prop the stick inside the mouth allowing to enter it safely
Before you go inside reach inside the tree's left nostril and pull out some tree snot
Inside the tree search the pop can to find a strange brick
Take it exit the tree and climb back down to the bottom
Use the pills again by the tiny bush by the base and you'll shrink even further
You can talk to Dynx the worm who collects sap
Give him the tree snot and he'll let you take the bucket
Return to your normal size and use the pills again by the anthill
You'll shrink to small enough that you could enter the ant hill if it weren't for the sturdy trap door blocking your way
Throw the strange grey plastic brick at the trap door
Plastic explosives do wonders for gaining entrance to inaccessible anthills
Enter the anthill and go to the West Wing
Take to Clifford the guard who gives you fairly useless information about the anthill except that you must speak to him before his wife Rachael the queen will speak with you
She's in the north wing and the ants' fruit storage is in the east wing

Take another pill and you'll be able to go inside the pop can
Search the can to find a stick
You can get the stick all goo'd up from the spider web above the can
Now head over to the Boris' hole
Light the wrapped stick with the matches then head to the roadblock
When CementHead give him beer and slip him the sleeping bean
Follow the path back to the west Forest of Emotion
With your torch you can now enter the dark part of the woods
Read the note on the tree
Notice the first letter of each line is capitalized
Look at each flower noting the first letter of its colour
Click on each flower in the order of the letters from the note and the vines blocking the way north will disappear
Go north and follow the path in the clearing to the stone gate
Go through the gate past the stone garden and into the mushroom grove
Use the pills to walk among the small mushrooms and press the button on the stump of the mushroom
The cave in blocking the cave has disappeared
Enter the cave and take the crowbar off the boxes of explosives
Return to the roadblock and head northwest to the overlook
Use the crowbar to pry up the loose rock and send it into the clearing below
Head back to the anthill and take the nail holding up the mirror in the central area
Go to the base of the tree and climb up
There's a small hole in the tree near the top of the screen
Put the nail in the hole and you'll be able to climb up farther
You can talk to Robyn the bird who tells you that he collects things
Perfect
So do you
Go out onto the east branch and look under the bottom branch to find a key
Take the key and return to the anthill
When the mirror fell down it revealed a locked safe
Use the key you found to open the safe
Take the diamond ring from inside and give it to Lissa in the castle
She'll be very grateful and tell you that the ants have something to remove the roadblock
Head back once again to the anthill and talk to the queen about it
She'll tell you that there's a bomb hidden in the fruit stores
Go there and look under the grapes
Take the bomb and use it to destroy the roadblock
Head up to the mountain This is it but those eyes seem to hypnotize you with their gaze
You can't get in
But wait the unicorn key that got you here must have some use
Insert it into the demon gate's left nostril
Go ahead and enter the NiteMare Part Three In Christian's Lair Near the top left corner of the wall in front of you is some dust that you can take
Get it search under the left pile of skulls to find a dead cockroach
Take that then enter the cemetary
Go left to the Forest of Agony and talk to the Bloody Stump
Keep talking to him until he tells you about why he is the way he is
Then take the dagger out of the stump
Also you can use the unicorn key to dislodge the newspaper stuck in the branches of the left tree
Head southwest to the Circle of Stones
You can take the bungee cord hanging in the tree
Go back to the Bloody Stump and take the northwest path to his right
There is a bucket hidden in the grass to the left of the path
Pick it up and head northwest to the Wall of Stones
You can take Charon's gravestone and if you search long enough you'll find a shard of wood in the creature's skull
Return to the Bloody Stump and this time take the path to the hill to the Stump's left
There's a shovel lying in the grass to the left of the path
Take it
Again dislodge the same newspaper that's now stuck in the tree on the left then go back to the cemetary
Take the path that leads beyond the hill and follow it into the schoolhouse
inside you can take a loose rock from the pile in the left corner then go back to the Forest of Agony
Head south to the River of Sorrow and talk to the body in the water
The boy's tied to a rock in the middle of the river so in order to free him you must cut the rope
Put the strange light red rock you got from the schoolhouse in the river
It's light enough to float allowing you to reach the boy and cut the rope with the dagger
Also fill up the empty bucket with water from the River of Sorrow
Go east to the grove and follow the path north
You'll come to a crossroads and the only path that leads anywhere is the south one leads to the crash site
All others eventually lead back to the cemetary
The roving newspaper is stuck in the tree on the right
Use the key to dislodge it again finally catching it
Head south then north to get to the crash site
Logically heading south then north will get you back where you started but who ever said a ten year old's mind was logical
Talk to the Unknown Soldier who wants an honourable burial
Dig him a grave with the shovel in the soft ground on the right
Put the soldier in the grave bury him and when you're finished put the Charon's grave stone over it to mark it
Go to the schoolhouse and burn the newspaper in the fire
Take the ashes and return to the Unknown Soldier's grave
Spread the ashes then the dust over the grave
A mirror will appear which you can take
Go to the spot where you found the shovel and follow the path to the summit
You can freeze the bucket of water in the icy flame there
Now take the path from the cemetary to the deserted mine
Use the mirror to use the power of the flashing eyes on themselves
You can now enter either of the eyes of the giant skull
Go inside and follow the path to the bridge
The cave's too hot to enter but if you drop the bucket of ice off the bridge into the lava it'll be cool enough for you to slip inside
When you get inside go to the east Chamber of Pain
You can talk to the man without skin who mumbles something about a picture
Take the sickle off the floor and head back to the cemetary
Take the northwest path to the left of the deserted mine to the distant overlook
Use the sickle to cut the leaf from the tree
Head to where you found the shovel this time entering the bunker
Stick the shard of wood into the ground by the hole in the floor and tie the bungee cord to it to be able to lower yourself into and back out of the hole
Head left and talk to Enthius the snake skeleton who tells you that he knows of places within your mind that you don't and that he's hungry
Feed him the dead cockroach and he'll open a secret passage for you
Enter the hidden cave and take the blank picture from the floor
Go back to the schoolhouse and hold the blank picture up to the green fire in the schoolhouse
Then go to the skinless man in the Chamber of Pain and give him the leaf from the tree
This will develop the picture
Take the picture and head the Forest of Agony
Go southwest to the Circle of Stones
Put the picture in the center of the circle and a crystal will appear
Go back to the skinless man and go right to the wall
Use the crystal on the hole in the floor and you'll find yourself in a caved in chamber
There is a skull with a candle standing on it talk to the creature inside Rennis the rat who requires proof of your identity before letting you pass
Show him the picture of your father and the rocks blocking your way will vanish
Go into the last chamber a Dead End
There are three items in front of you a pair of shattered glasses just like Terry's a plant with a vile odour and a teddy bear with glowing red eyes
Pick up the teddy bear to confront Christian once and for all

lengreen hotmail com PRELIMINARY IMPORTANT NOTES A This is not a minimalist walkthru It not only contains all the actions essential to finishing the game but also many others that only hint at future tasks amp or flesh out the story Hence several of the actions described here are not entirely necessary in order merely to complete the game in the shortest possible time Quite a lot of the explanatory dialog occurs when entering a new situation and is not repeated To properly understand the gameplay and enjoy it the walkthru prompts you to perform certain actions even though sometimes you are informed that they will produce no at least immediate results It also refers to many characters whose names amp or identities can easily be overlooked
There are doubtless additional things of interest that you can do which are not mentioned here but may add even more to your entertainment It may hopefully serve not only as a hint sheet for those who are stuck but also as a guide to those who enjoyed the game and wish to play it through again for fuller understanding of its intricacies or as a check against anything missed
B Often you can perform actions in a different order from that described here but sometimes not
C Author s Note It s relatively easy to prove that an action or series of actions is possible but you can t say definitely where impossible In some cases where I ve done this I ve marked the place with If anybody finds such an impossible scenario to be actually valid please email me Also there may be random variations or I may have slipped up
D Whenever dialog trees are displayed cover as much dialog as you are allowed to there are hints and clues in many of them N B On very rare occasions you may be penalized for talking too much One of the most common causes of stuckness in this game is due to incomplete dialog If you are stuck and can find no apparent reason return to characters with whom you ve had long conversations and talk with them until the only dialog options repeat or disappear
E ALWAYS do the following actions as a matter of course you will generally not be prompted to do them Whenever you enter a new scene examine everything where the question mark icon changes to an exclamation mark Click on everything where the hand icon extends its index finger unless you think this could be counter productive Pick up everything you can and examine it immediately in your inventory
F Save VERY frequently There are several places where you can be killed with very little or no warning especially in the Dark World and there are also some impasses When these happen you are forced back to the start sequence of the game again If you haven t saved fairly recently you may be in for substantial waste of time amp effort There are only save slots When these are filled you can overwrite them If you wish it s quite easy to save complete batches of files each but you have to do this outside the game itself i e
in Windows or DOS or whatever
G From time to time you must discuss progress with Mike s friend Jack Click on the bench just outside Mike s front door If Mike continues standing and says I m not tired this is not a suitable time If Mike sits it is a sign that Jack will drive up on his motorcycle Occasionally it might happen that Mike sits Jack doesn t arrive and Mike says I guess Jack s not in the neighborhood This is either a random occurrence or a bug In either case repeat until Jack arrives
H Some abbreviations are used throughout N W Normal World D W Dark World EX Question mark icon changed into EXclamation mark Examine FI Hand icon extends its index FInger Act upon or talk to R At or near the right edge of your monitor screen L At or near the left edge of your monitor screen T At or near the top edge of your monitor screen B At or near the bottom edge of your monitor screen M At or near the middle area of your monitor screen
I MAP DESIGNATIONS There are similar maps for both worlds On the map of the N W the captions remain constant throughout
On the map of the D W most captions start off fairly similarly to those of the N W but some alter twice or times according to progress probably different for each player To avoid confusion I will refer to the locations excluding the connecting portals which only appear later in both Worlds simply by the abbreviations below I have listed alongside them their ORIGINAL only captions The first four run clockwise starting at T R and the fifth is in M Loc Business District Loc Civic Center Loc Mike s House Mike s Neighborhood in D W Loc Carnival Power Center in D W Loc Hank s Diner amp Pool Hall Downtown in D W

Go L Look at the fortune teller Pandora and her pet snake Lucifer Dialog with Pandora Hand inventory items to her to foretell your future she will only take at a time and her prophecies don t seem very insightful Exit carnival Return to map Author s Note At this point in time whilst at the carnival you might wish to try the Hall of Mirrors amp or some of the games of skill amp chance I did but it got me nowhere You can't master the Hall of Mirrors and the games are all rigged See C above Go to the shed in the backyard of the Pool Hall Dialog with Slim listen to his weird conspiracy theories Return to map Go to your house Loc on the map Sit on the bench Jack rides up dialog he suggests alternative suspects Visit the sheriff dialog about his affair with Rita and his being kicked off the Dallas police force Visit the morgue waiting room Behind the glass window you see Doc Larson making out with some female Tap on the window and confront Larson Dialog This can be tricky He may dismiss you and exit but you can return as often as you like You have to get him to lose his temper and bang his fist on the counter thus opening the latch to the morgue door The only way to achieve this is by alluding to his being kicked off a hospital staff for seducing a woman patient If this topic doesn t materialize you haven t spoken sufficiently to the sheriff Go back and get him to talk about the condition of Rita s body and Doc Larson s peculiar behavior Then return to the morgue and you ll eventually succeed Enter from the waiting room into the morgue itself Examine and open freezer Rita s headless corpse ugh Examine EX toe tag of corpse on table Mark Danson with a glass key round his neck Take key can t do that Look at the file cabinet and examine contents FI several time until monologue repeats itself You should hear a lot of info including autopsy reports Check in inventory that you ve got Doc Larson s little black book Now you can take Mark s key Minnie got the names mixed up and mailed the key to M D but Mark Danson instead of Mike Dawson If you don t succeed it probably means that you haven t talked sufficiently to Pandora See C above so return and ask her about Minnie amp Daisy her riddle is the key to all this Return to and enter the Hall of Mirrors at the carnival Author s Note Since you are given no instructions I ll lay out the hints a line at a time so that the reader can choose as much or as little as he she needs It is not too difficult You can take as much time or as many moves as you like and you are never killed You can easily move around wherever you are permitted and restart instantaneously I recommend trying to figure it out without ANY of the help below
a Your objective is to enter one of the doors and make your way to an ornate room
b Once inside you are in a honeycomb of rooms some accessible and others not The rooms are arranged in a sort of matrix with rows and columns
c If you look carefully you can identify the ornate room as being somewhat different from all the others
d Counting rows from T and columns from R this room is row column
e Now try to make it on your own If you can t read further
f Sweep the whole area and EX will indicate the ornate room
g You may have noticed a VERY small difference in one of the rooms
h If you can t find it EX will highlight a keyhole in one of the rooms

Darkness Within The Dark Lineage Walkthrough by Becky Waxman This is a lengthy intricate game with dark occult and violent themes
I was more comfortable playing it in daylight than at night of course if you are braver than I am the best way to play it is probably at night with headphones on the sound and music are quite effective
The game has three difficulty levels
This walkthrough is written for the Standard difficulty level
The game is more enjoyable initially if you go into the Options menu and set the gamma correction to a higher setting than the default setting
About midway along the slider bar should be good
If you find the environments are too light after you've become acquainted with the gameworld it's easy to adjust the gamma correction back to the default setting
Some people myself included with NVIDIA graphics cards have not been able to get the game to run without going to the NVIDIA website to download the latest version of the PhysX drivers
It is helpful to read the manual for Darkness Within because the interface is different than that of many adventure games
Moving Around Movement in this game requires you to press a key on the keyboard usually the quot W quot key while moving the mouse around in quot mouse look quot mode
This is easy to do but it does require two hands all the time you're moving
Movement goes a bit faster if you hit the quot Caps Lock quot key
The inventory and much of the object interaction is point and click
You can crouch down in the game the quot C quot key and sometimes this is necessary to find hotspots on the floor or under furniture
You can also walk while crouching
Note it's easy to forget that you're crouching if you suddenly can't walk up stairs or can't reach things try pressing the quot C quot key to see if you need to stand up again
Using the spacebar you can jump up on just about anything in the environment that's a couple of feet tall including many barrels and crates and some of the beds
This does sometimes have a use but often it's just to add to the feeling of quot being there quot I'll mention jumping on things only when it's essential or especially fun
Object Interactions Some inventory items can be quot enabled quot or quot equipped quot by right clicking on them in inventory
This is true of the lantern the flashlights and the compass for example
If after enabling an item you want to get rid of it for awhile go into the inventory and right click on the item in inventory
It will then disappear from the main screen
There are items in each environment that you can click on to have them identified that don't have a purpose other than to add quot atmosphere quot many of these I leave to you to find on your own
Sometimes when you quot take quot items they go into the inventory
To access the inventory right click to bring it up left click on the item you want right click to close the inventory screen and then left click the item on the appropriate hotspot in the gameworld
If you have an inventory item that you want to put back in the inventory right click to put it back
Inventory items can also be combined in the quot Howard's Mind quot feature
Other times when you quot take quot things the item attaches itself to the cursor so you are walking around while carrying a pillow or a crate for example
To drop the pillow or crate you find an open spot probably on the floor and left click to drop the item
If the item is glowing red it cannot be dropped where you are trying to drop it
Look for a more open space and sometimes it helps to drop the item if you raise it up before dropping it
A few of these quot shiftable quot items must be moved to see what's under them or to use them to gain access to something
But many of the items that can be moved around in this way are there just for fun
These have no use in terms of getting the game to progress
Some items can be either pulled or pushed chairs for instance
To do this hold the left mouse button down over the quot push pull quot icon and use the quot W quot key to push and the quot S quot key to pull
Other Stuff You will encounter many close up screens usually after clicking on an quot examine quot hotspot
Once in a close up it will almost always be necessary to click on the yellow arrow quot exit the close up quot icon before you can get back to the regular gameworld
If you can't get out of a screen hitting the quot Esc quot key also will help
Dialogs can be clicked through
The game contains save game slots save often
The game contains some unusual features including underlining text and exploring ideas in quot Howard's Mind quot I talk about these features in the body of the walkthrough the first time that they occur in the game
NOTE This is just one pathway through the game There are optional thought combinations and other intricacies that are not mentioned here but that you can seek out on your own
Even after finishing the game I left doors that were unlocked inventory items that were unused and a box that I couldn't unlock
Also from the final Game Results screen I could tell that I missed secrets hidden clues and Easter Eggs
Now to begin The Cottage In this game you assume the role of Howard Loreid detective
After the opening cut scene you awaken in pain
As your head clears the room comes into focus
You are in a cottage not in a mental institution which is where you last remember being
You don't know how you arrived at the cottage or why you came or were sent here

Train Trip and Arkhamend Station You'll find yourself on a train yes that's you sitting in the corner looking stunned

Once the cut scene ends you'll be at the train station for Arkhamend
Enable the lantern and walk around and examine everything including the quot graffiti quot on the walls and at least one of the train schedules
Walk further into the station and you'll end up automatically at the entrance to the Arkhamend town square

Cut Scene then wake up
Open your hotel room door and take the staircase down
You'll overhear an important conversation
When you try to go further downstairs you will automatically go back up to bed
Morning Such as it Is In Arkhamend Go downstairs and talk to the inn keeper
I'm not sure what reaction your lies will evoke I said that I was a writer researching the war which seemed to go down all right
The Worm's Feast Recollections of the Past Exit the hotel and go to the Worm's Feast the local bookstore
Examine the stuff on the desk
Speak with the bookseller Henry
I told him I was a writer interested in the war
Open the counter flap to walk through and go down to the basement
Enable the lantern
Examine everything downstairs
Pick up the large metal lever it looks like a crowbar near the stuffed green dragon
Examine the stethoscope on the shelf under the green dragon
Examine the toy jeep and music box on the farthest bookcase from the door
The book you are looking for Recollections of the Past is on the bottom shelf of the bookcase farthest from the door
It is slightly separate from the other books on that shelf and is in a silvery metallic container
It is on the bottom shelf below the toy jeep and just slightly to the left of the jeep's position
You can only see the book's spine or really the spine of the case it's in
I could see the book but couldn't find the hotspot until I was standing between the two bookcases in just the right spot
You may have to move slightly forward or back or to the side to get in the right position to trigger the hotspot
Once you've found the hotspot click to take the book
Working Really Hard to Open the Book Click to put the book into inventory
Right click on the book in inventory and then click on the bottom left corner of the book where a small quot examine quot icon can be triggered
This brings up the book container's locking mechanism
Click to use it and it separates
You'll see six metal bolt like quot wheels quot These each have a rectangle etched on one side
Clicking on these quot wheels quot rotates them
Clicking on the raised rectangle on the handle quot sets quot the mechanism if any of the rectangles etched on the quot wheels quot are visible when you click on the raised rectangle on the handle you can see a tiny spike spring out of those particular quot wheels
quot Clicking on the handle itself puts the two pieces of the mechanism back together this only works if the lock is not in the quot set quot position with spikes sticking out if you can't put the two pieces of the mechanism back together click on the raised rectangle on the handle to quot unset quot it and click the handle to put the pieces together
The idea is to set the quot wheels quot in the right alignment put the device back together and then quot set quot it by clicking on the rectangle in the handle which will unlock the device
When the device is put back together the quot wheel quot that you worked with most recently when it was in two pieces glows red that is the active quot wheel quot when the device is together
Experiment with moving the quot wheels quot putting the two pieces together and taking them apart and hitting the raised rectangle on the handle
As you experiment with this mechanism Loreid will comment that he can't hear the necessary sounds from the lock
Right click to put the book back into inventory
Move to the bookcase that has the dragon
Below the dragon is a stethoscope easier to see if you have the lantern or flashlight on
Until now you couldn't pick up the stethoscope but now you can
Click it to pick it up
Combining Items in Howard's Mind Right click to bring up the inventory
To the right is a brain icon it's probably glowing at this point
This is the quot button quot to bring up Howard's Mind which allows you to combine thoughts and or inventory items
Click on the brain icon
Note You'll see a list of items along the left side of the Howard's Mind screen
These are Howard's thoughts and can be clicked on as a sort of review
At some point some of these thoughts will also be combinable just as the inventory items are combinable
In Howard's Mind click to pick up the stethoscope and put it in a blank quot combine quot slot in Howard's Mind
The tutorial will tell you to click and drag this is incorrect
Just click on the stethoscope and move the cursor to the blank slot and click to put the stethoscope in the blank slot
Then click to pick up the book and put it into another blank quot combine quot slot in Howard's Mind
Then click the gears icon next to quot Outcome quot You'll see the stethoscope attached to the book
Clicking again puts the book plus stethoscope back in inventory
Right click to use the book again and the locking device comes up
Unlocking the Book While the device is together you can now hear the sound each quot wheel quot makes when you click the raised rectangle button to set the device
You know which wheel you are hearing because the most recently turned wheel glows red once the device is together
When each quot wheel quot is correctly aligned it will give a low satisfying clunk sound when you click on the raised rectangular button when the two pieces are together
When it's incorrectly aligned you'll hear a higher less final click sound when you click on the raised rectangular button when the two pieces are together
If you want to figure out the book lock combination yourself With the lock in two pieces click on one of the wheels click on the handle to put the device together click on the raised rectangular button and listen to the click
Then click on the raised rectangular button to quot unset quot the device and click on the handle to separate the device you know which quot wheel quot you're working with when the device is together because it glows red
Continue to do this over and over figuring out by trial and error the correct alignment by the sound you receive when hitting the raised rectangular button when the device is together judging if you are getting a quot clunk quot sound or a quot click quot sound each time
If you just want to get on with the proceedings and quickly open the book With the device in two pieces click the quot wheels quot until all the etched rectangles are facing toward you original default position
In my game this was how the alignment worked Starting with all the quot wheels quot with the rectangular etching facing toward you in default position And starting left to right The first wheel will be rotated twice
The second wheel will be rotated twice
The third wheel shouldn't be rotated at all
The fourth wheel should be rotated three times
The fifth wheel should be rotated once
The sixth wheel should be rotated once
Click on the handle to put the device together
Click on the raised rectangle and the device quot sets quot The book is now unlocked

Put the pieces together
The pieces can be rotated by right clicking
They quot spring quot slightly together to join two correct pieces that are placed near one another
HINT In my game the two largest pieces of the left part of the puzzle you can see the left part of the circle in them do NOT need to be rotated
When the puzzle is assembled take a good look at the black pattern path drawn along the lines in the center of the diagram
This will be much less noticeable once the diagram goes into inventory
When the pieces are assembled correctly Loreid won't pick them up because they'll fall apart

There's a code mechanism with symbols pointers and a knob
We need more information before we can figure it out
Exit the close up
The Old Building Hovel Exterior Symbols and the Rock Garden Or Opening that Thing in the Floor Walk outside the hovel old building and note the stones on the ground
There are sixteen of them
Use the camera from inventory on each one of them this reveals a symbol on each rock and they match the symbols on the code mechanism in the floor back in the room with the table
Note one stone is particularly difficult to find
It's in a crook of the fence next to the field
It's between the stone with the symbol that looks like an quot S quot and the stone with a symbol that looks like it has rabbit ears
Once you've used the camera to flash each of the stones get out the compass and note which stones are farthest out in each cardinal direction
The stone that's farthest East looks like a stick figure of a human with arms up and a circle and a handle under its arms
The stone that's farthest North looks like a bent letter quot X quot with a circle next to it
The stone that's farthest West looks like a letter quot Y quot with a dot in the middle
The stone that's farthest South has a bar on the top and a curlicue on the bottom which is attached to an angle
Right click in inventory on the paper diagram that you put together from torn jigsaw like pieces to observe it more closely
It looks like a compass rose and each cardinal direction can be associated with a colored quot jewel quot on the paper diagram compass rose
From the book up in the attic room you get this information
East red North white West black South yellow
Obviously some of these colors are wrong
Whoever put the paper together must have torn it apart when he realized he had gotten it wrong
Assume that East black North white West Red South Yellow This makes things a whole lot easier and you might actually then solve the puzzle
Look at the paper diagram compass rose again
Note that there are grey circular web like lines
There's one dark rather smudgy line through the middle of the diagram
And very faintly darker than the grey circular lines is a pattern path that starts ends with the Black quot jewel quot The other end from what I can tell is in the middle of the diagram
This faintly darker pattern path is what's important
We will assume this pattern path starts with the Black jewel and not in the middle of the diagram though that's just a quot trial and error quot assumption
So outside of the hovel walk over to the stone that is farthest East and note its shape as I've described earlier it's looks like a stick figure of a human with arms raised and a circle and a handle under its arms
The pattern path on the paper heads south toward the yellow quot jewel quot so use your compass to head in a southerly direction
You will continue in this direction without reversing your orientation for the entire pattern
On the diagram compass rose the pattern goes forward through lines and then jogs down in another direction
The jog signifies that that's the next stone in the path that you must note
So go forward stones and note the symbol that looks like two arcs
Go forward more stones and note the stone that looks like a stick figure acrobat
Go forward stones and note the stone that is the farthest North stone it looks like a bent letter quot X quot with a circle next to it
Go forward stone it looks like two circles with rabbit ears
Go forward stones and note the stone that looks like a rectangle with a line cross through it
Go forward more stones and note the stone that looks like a bug with four legs coming out of it
You now have the sequence for the code mechanism with symbols and pointers that's housed in the floor of the room with the table
The Hint system refers to this as the quot elevator code quot but of course you have no idea what it actually is at this point
The Old Building Hovel Interior Return to the flap in the floor in the room with the table
Input the sequence you've just written down into the code mechanism in the floor lined up with the two pointers
Note Symbol the one with rabbit ears is very easily confused with another symbol that also has two lines coming out of it
If the sequence doesn't work mess around with symbol first to see if you have the right symbol
When the symbols are all in line with the pointers click on the quot knob quot thing on the right
If you're still confused this is what worked for me Looking at the mechanism in the floor when it is at its default setting all the quot wheels quot look like the stick figure acrobat
Going from left to right and clicking on each wheel Wheel click times Wheel click times Wheel leave it just like it is Wheel click times Wheel click times Wheel click time Wheel click times If you're correct there's a click and you draw slightly away from the mechanism
Click on the floor near the mechanism to use the floor as an elevator

You'll be returned to the quot elevator quot The Old Building Hovel The Underground Galleries Basement Blues Walk forward again and this time turn left
The door at the end is locked
Use the key from the desk on the padlock
Open the door
There's nothing useful in the desk drawers
Examine the document on the desk
It's a Morse Code Alphabet
Examine the box cabinet on the desk it's locked
Open the wardrobe doors
Behind the left one is a gas container
Click to take it
Leave the room
Turn left and walk forward a bit more and find another door on the left
This one isn't locked
Enter and examine the microscope if you like
There are two wardrobes at the end of the room both covered with bugs
You can right click on your handy dandy bug sprayer in inventory if you like
This will enable the sprayer and you can spray the bugs on the wardrobe though you must be thorough
If you're not thorough enough and you try to open the wardrobe door you will have a quot seeing scarlet quot moment
You can't apparently die however
The easier method is to right click on the protective suit in inventory
This means you can only see through the mask but you don't have to rid the wardrobe of every single bug either
Open the right wardrobe left door and take the two cylinders in the box
Open the right wardrobe right door and take the empty metallic capsule the one that smells eerily
You can open the left wardrobe doors but there's nothing worth seeing
Leave the room
Remove the protective suit if you're wearing it
Listening to the Phonograph Go back to the room with the phonograph
Examine the phonograph and place a cylinder from inventory on it
Remember whether you've just placed the sideways cylinder or the straight up cylinder so you won't listen to the same one twice
Then click the small red lever at the front corner of the phonograph
You can hear sound but nothing intelligible
Click on the machine to the right of the phonograph and note that the dials are now working
There are three bars with knobs under the dials
There's a quot use quot icon for each knob which is on the lowest setting
Clicking on the knobs pushes the bars all the way up or if they're in the up position all the way down
The goal is to get the arrows on both dials into the quot green quot area on the dial
Start by playing around with the dials a bit
Hint You'll note that all the knobs cause the arrows on the two dials to go in the opposite direction from one another
The Middle knob causes the arrows to go in the opposite direction of that triggered by the Left knob and the Right knob
Hint It's a good idea to start with the Middle knob
Hint You'll probably use the Middle knob more than the others
Note If the arrows stop registering sound altogether back out of the close up and touch the red lever by the phonograph again to get the cylinder moving again
When you have set the device correctly the red knob at the right of the machine lights up when this happens the voice on the phonograph can be heard
After listening to one cylinder use the same procedure with the second cylinder
Learn from the phonograph that the large speaker machine in this room is number
Also learn NOT to look in the window of the large central machine when bringing back a soul from the dead
This knowledge may make you want to look in the windoweven morethan before but deal with it
Look down near the base of the large central machine and examine the rectangular area
Input the number from the phonograph by clicking on the buttons beneath the numbers
Click out of the close up
Examine the same part of the machine there's now a hole where something can be inserted
You can try inserting everything in inventory that's round but you aren't ready yet

The unblocked door has a broken lock and can't be opened
You'll need to free up the other door
Note it is much easier to get behind the table and push it than it is to stand in front of the table and pull it
So try not to do anything that accidentally shoves the table back against the wall
If you do have to pull the table just be patient it does move eventually
Pull and push everything away from the door
Hold down the quot push pull quot icon with the left mouse button and press the quot W quot key to push things and the quot S quot key to pull things
Once all the furniture is away from the door click to open the door
This simple action was very difficult for some reason partly perhaps because the door will slowly close once you get it partially open
I finally got the door open by holding down the left mouse button on the quot open quot hotspot and pressing the quot S quot key
Another way to open it is through repeated clicking though I'm not sure quite why that finally triggered it
From the cellar room with the chute you've entered another cellar room that has bed frames in it

I tried combining the black mirror prepared in a human head shape with the sledgehammer in Howard's Mind but Howard wouldn't perform an action that would I am convinced save everyone a lot of trouble
By game's end I still hadn't figured out what to do with the black mirror
Approach the desk and examine the skull and the map

Press the quot C quot key to crouch down
Then move until you see an quot open quot icon on the parquet tile that was covered by the chair
Click to pull up the tile
Take the key with the skeleton shape
Take the envelope
In my game I had to press the quot S quot key to back up slightly before I got an quot examine quot hotspot for the envelope
In inventory right click to open the envelope
Read the book
Underline Remember to click on the gears icon after underlining My name is Nathaniel your grandfather
There is an object which acts as a key
The other two will be safe with me
Use the carrier to reach your destination
Press the quot C quot key to stand back up
Main Floor of The Gate Go downstairs to the study
Examine the side table
From inventory use the hairpin in the lock
Click to open the box
Read the note and examine the item
Exterior of The Gate From inventory use the key general purpose on the front door
Exit and go outside
You can try to leave through the entrance gates at the end of the driveway but Loreid feels it's too dangerous
Packs of wolves roam the area though wolves might be kinder than Loreid's grandfather was
Walk to the quot guest house quot and use the key with a skeleton in inventory on the door
Click to open
The Crypt So this is a crypt and not an ordinary one either
You can walk around and read the names of dead and soon to be dead
Loreids
You can examine both Williams' coffin and Nathaniel's coffin and when you click the quot examine quot hotspots for each each coffin will be set down on the floor
You can open these coffins on the floor and examine the contents
When Williams' coffin is open click on the bottle between Williams' skull and shoulder bone
When Nathaniel's coffin is open examine it and keep clicking until you get a key
If you feel like desecrating the remains of this horrible man who was your grandfather you will be disappointed
Loreid doesn't seem to be the vengeful type
I tried the lever the sledgehammer and the heavy music box on Nathaniel's skeleton but nothing worked
The closest I got to quot airing quot my feelings was when I enabled the bug sprayer and sprayed it near his head in the coffin
I then fumigated the rest of the crypt which was strangely satisfying
You can try to open the door at the back of the crypt but it's stuck
The sledgehammer doesn't work here either nor does the lever
Exit the crypt
A storm has begun
Enable the lantern
Return to the house
Main Floor of The Gate You can try to take the car if you like but Loreid won't leave because the storm is too severe
Return to the kitchen and use the key from inventory on the locked door near the refrigerator
Examine everything inside
All over The Gate Go back to Loreid's bedroom
Examine the bed to sleep
Loreid wakes up to sounds in the walls or is this another dream vision
Go downstairs and open the kitchen door
A cut scene occurs
Follow the rats down into the cellar
Go to the right to the room with the bottles
How'd we miss that when we first explored the cellar
A Guest Above and Below Ground at The Gate Loreid wakes up again
Go downstairs to something unexpected
Enable the lantern if it isn't enabled already
Loreid needs to go back to the cellar
Note the words scrawled on the wall as you go down the stairs
Turn right and continue through to where you saw rats pouring through an opening in the floor it's the room with bottles
Examine the floor
From inventory use the sledgehammer on the floor
Step down into the subterranean area beneath the cellar
Click to open the gate
Wake up with no memory of how you made it back to bed
Enable the lantern if necessary
Go back to the cellar and re enter the hole in the floor
Explore the subterranean area
Note the cave in
Go forward into the only available tunnel
Open the door on the left
Take the dagger
Speak to the hooded figure
Leave the subterranean area and return to the house
You may need to enable the lantern again and click to get up the stairs
Leaving Home Go to the kitchen and then to the garage
Examine the car
From inventory use the gas container on the car
Examine the car again
Arkhamend Town Enable the lantern
Return to the Worm's Feast
Henry isn't there
Click on the new book on the counter
When you walk downstairs searching for Henry he isn't there either walk into the crate near the bottom of the stairs and it moves
Crouch down quot C quot key to examine the floor where the crate used to be and see a trap door
Examine the trap door and examine what's beneath it
Take the two items which go into inventory you can examine them further there by right clicking on them
Press quot C quot to stand back up
Exit the Worm's Feast and enter the square
Walk to the alley in which stairs go down between buildings
Examine the manhole on the ground it leads to the sewers
Note If you talk to Jacob again at the white house he'll run through the same conversation this can get a bit long but what he says will now make more sense so if you're seriously quot into quot the story you might want to talk to him and hear what he says again
Enter the Camphorwood Inn
The men you suspect of robbing your grandfather's tomb are here
Loreid wishes to follow them
Go out of the inn the game will only let you walk so far before the men begin to move again
Go down to the manhole in the alleyway down the stairs and click to enter the sewers
The Sewers Note visual cues to finding this particular ladder again when you return
With your back to the ladder across from you and to the left is a leaky pipe and an odd bit of graffiti on the wall almost a partial painting
Enable the lantern
This part of the game is maze like
You can explore on your own or follow the directions below
Stand with your back to the ladder you just came down and face the quot water quot in front of you
Turn left and walk around a bend to the left
Eventually you will come to a short bridge
Cross it and turn right
Keep going and note that as you go around another left bend there's a large black symbol on the wall to your left
Keep going until you hit a metal fence grate
The gate is on the other side so turn around and take the short metal bridge behind you to get to the side with the gate
After going through the gate cross the next short metal bridge turn right and go forward to the hole in the wall
The Rokland Nursing Home Est
You are in an abandoned nursing home
You can walk around and examine things if you like
Walk upstairs to the left and hear voices behind a door those must be the thieves
Turn around and go back over to the hole and look behind you at the downstairs steps
Go down the stairs and go through the door at the bottom
In the distance is an odd blue light
You can explore all the rooms and push some bed frames around if you like but the important room is the one with the colonial portrait on the wall as you look through the doorway second door on the left
There are file cabinets whose drawers you can open but I couldn't find anything in any of them
Near the file cabinets are a set of display cases
Examine the display case with the gorilla and click to pick up the object at the end of the necklace the gorilla is wearing
Now that you have the item you were looking for go back into the hallway and head in the direction opposite the blue light
Go through the door and upstairs toward the hole that leads back into the sewers
Ouch
Wake up upside down
Listen to the conversation
Walk forward and click on the door
Wait a bit and click on the door again
Examine what's on the floor as you exit
Pause long enough to quot contemplate your own mortality quot this may bring up an intriguing visual effect
Head in the direction opposite to that of the blue light
Open the door
Before starting up the stairs examine the second thief
Step over him and crouch down quot C quot key to observe something on the floor
Enable the lantern and you'll see an intriguing knot in the wood floor that looks like someone wearing glasses but it isn't quot hot quot Take the metal object with a handle on the floor between the body and the wall
Stand back up quot C quot key
Go back to the sewers and click to go through the hole
Returning Through the Sewers To return cross over the first small metal bridge and walk through the metal gate
Cross the next short metal bridge
Turn left
Keep going looking at the wall on your right until you get to the bend where the large black symbol is on the wall to your right
Cross the next short metal bridge
Turn left
Keep going until you see a ladder this should be the ladder you came down in the first place it's across from and a short ways down from the leaky pipe and the odd graffiti
Press quot W quot to climb up the ladder
Revisiting The Camphorwood Inn Return to the Camphorwood Inn
The inn keeper has stepped out
Go behind the bar and take the two keys hanging in a wooden key cabinet
Go toward the first floor rooms through the double doors
On the left is a bureau
Open the drawer and examine the newspaper clipping
Underline Remember to click on the gears icon after underlining Two cruelly butchered human corpses were found in the Northwood forest Walk down the hall to the first room on the left
From inventory use the key for the st floor room on the first door on the left
Click to open
Ingrid's Room at the Camphorwood The challenge here is to move the bed into the right place and then search the floor
Note there is a glitch here that can turn the bed completely around when that happens it may be impossible to find the right hotspot on the floor
If as you are pushing it the bed goes crazy and finally flips around into a different position and if you then can't find an quot examine quot hotspot anywhere on the floor go back to a previous save and start again
Push or pull the chair near the bed over toward the door
Pull the bed out as far as you can
Jump spacebar to get over the bed
Enable the lantern
As you stand facing the window turn slightly to the right toward the right corner
Press the quot C quot key to crouch down
Walk toward the right corner searching the floor as you go
Click to examine you may need to click twice
From inventory remove the lever and use it on the floor
Note the lever can be difficult to see in inventory it is most likely located in a slot in inventory near that of the lantern and it may look like a blank slot with a faint line in it
Take the last metal piece of the artifact from its hiding place beneath the floorboards
Click out of the close up
In Howard's Mind combine the pieces of the metal artifact to get something that Loreid calls a quot sign of soul metamorphosis quot
Right click on the completed artifact in inventory to examine it further
It bears a striking resemblance to the Loreid coat of arms on the ring an eye with three marks above it and seven marks below it
At this point it may be necessary to press quot C quot to stand up from a crouching position
The Second Floor Room Next Door Leave the room turn left and go up to the second floor
From inventory use the key for the nd door on the right that's the door next to Loreid's room
Search the room
It smells horrible and the bathroom is locked
I did not figure out how to get the bathroom door open
Use the map in inventory to go to The Gate
You could also probably go back to the car in the square and click on it to return to The Gate
Reopening The Gate Back to the mansion
You can putter around inside the mansion to see if anything has changed since you left I noted a couple of changes
If you want to put off the final confrontation you can find a nice place to hide by hopping on the hedge near the cellar chute at the back door and then getting under the porch in the farthest corner
However sooner or later Loreid must face his destiny
Mustn't he
There's no way to avoid it sooner or later Loreid has to go down that well
Remember it's at the end of the pathway to the right as you stand at the entrance looking toward the mansion
Loreid should now unlock the cover over the well
From inventory use the strange metallic object with the wooden handle on the well cover
Click to enter
After the Fall the Subterranean Area Walk forward down a strange hallway
Walk into the elevator turn around and examine the quot X quot on the floor
Click to open the panel
Going from left to right click the first wheel twice the second wheel twice the third wheel twice and the fourth wheel once or twice it differed in different playthroughs
Steam begins to issue from the mechanism which is what you want
Once you see the steam click out of the close up
Click on the floor to use the elevator
You can move around while the elevator is moving be sure to look out the window
When it stops open the door
Spend some time looking out the windows and up at the ceiling
Go back and try the elevator door it looks like you'll be going forward from here not back
Walk forward click on the door and enable the lantern
Click on the door again and walk forward through the gate
Turn left and speak to the man on the other side of the pit
Retrace your steps
The way is blocked in one direction so go down the center hallway to the gate and keep going until you reach the ornate door
Click on it
From inventory use the metal artifact sign of a soul metamorphosis on the door
Click to open the door
The Final Scene Examine what's behind you
You can also examine the statues
SAVE YOUR GAME HERE
Walk forward into these nightmarish environs
You can walk around and look at everything and you also can examine the well pit
At the center of all the drama is a creature with strange facial features
Before him is a large glowing red crystal
Examine the crystal
In a final conversation you are given two dialog choices
With one of the dialog choices where you assert your independence you will then find yourself rooted to the spot and ironically only one of the inventory items can still be used on only one hotspot
With the other dialog choice you'll also find yourself rooted to the spot but you have a choice as to what to do with the inventory item it will work on two different hotspots
What you choose to do with the inventory item will trigger one of two different endings
A Game Results screen appears and indicates your final disposition location
It pays to sit through the credits or actually you can click through the credits or even hit Esc to skip them which will bring you directly to the last cut scene to see the possible implications of Loreid's final disposition location

INTRODUCTION Being that this is my first and probably only walkthrough I will ever do I'll just say now that I originally just wrote this stuff down to help mywife when she played the game and since there were no walkthroughs upfor it yet I decided to go ahead and submit it
The walkthrough whiletruncated answers every puzzle reveals every secret item and willsuccessfully get you through the entire game including the quot Revisited quot levels
The nitpicky little stuff like controls I won't be includingbecause I feel like if you went through the trouble to look up a walkthrough then you are probably capable of reading the book the game came with toget the controls
I'm also not going to retell you the story of the game If you want the story read the book
This walkthrough is designed simplyto get you through the game when you get stuck UPDATE JUNE Due to the popularity of this walkthrough and fromnumerous requests to do so I will retract my statement about this being theonly walkthrough I am doing
I am beginning work on the walkthrough forGrand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories

Contact Information HELPUL NOTE Since the walkthrough must be presented to the various websites ina txt based format I have included URL's throughout the walkthroughto images that I have posted to help you get through the game Because of the popularity of the walkthrough the website that Ihad originally hosted the images on has shut me down because Iexceeded my allotted bandwidth within a span of days therefore I've put them up on my own webspace upping my monthly bandwidthlimitation from MB to Gig These images are hosted in a photo gallery of my own creation onone of my own websites
I have only put in a few as necessary tohelp you get through the game however there are over screenshotsin total throughout the entire gallery if you would like to view it It can be found at http www northsearesearch com dvcgallery index phpAs of June the PDF and DOC versions can be downloaded fromthe links shown below PDF http www northsearesearch com dvcfiles DVinci Illustratedpdf zipDOC http www northsearesearch com dvcfiles DVinci Illustrateddoc zip BEFORE YOU WRITE TO ME
I do not mind answering questions in fact I have enjoyed hearing from folksall over the world already and have met some really great people but I wouldask this Please don't write with a question until you have CAREFULLY checkedthe walkthrough to be sure the answer isn't there
I have been recieving a LOTof e mail and I'm the type of person who has to answer EVERY SINGLE ONE it isjust the kinda guy I am and I wouldn't sleep if I didn't answer one not thatI sleep anyway
Far too many of the questions have been things that wereanswered in the walkthrough and either because the individual read too quicklyor they had not read far enough they didn't find the answer they needed Please help me by making absolutely sure the answer isn't in the walkthroughalready I am a writer
I write in english and I appreciate those that respond to mein english do it correctly
I do not respond to quot internet shorthand quot
Donot write quot r quot instead of quot are quot
Do not write quot quot instead of quot for quot
Do notwrite quot quot instead of quot to quot and for God's sake don't write quot knoe quot instead of quot know quot
I took the time to write using proper english you will take the timeto respond to me in proper english
I believe quot internet shorthand quot is anabomination of the language and simply goes to demonstrate INCREDIBLE laziness I also used capital letters punctuation and sentence structure
I expectyou to do so as well
The idea here is that if you can read it correctly then you ought to be able to write it correctly too
This is a major pet peeveof mine and I will not bend on it
Any e mail sent to me like this willsimply get this paragraph copied and pasted in return
EDITED JUNE OK PEOPLE FOR THE LAST TIME IF THE ANSWER IS INTHIS WALKTHROUGH I AM NO LONGER ANSWERING YOUR E MAILS
ONE GUY HAS EVENDECIDED TO ARGUE WITH ME THAT I DON'T GIVE THE DIGIT CODE NEEDED AT THEBEGINNING OF BANK OF ZURICH WHEN NOT ONLY IS IT THERE ITS THERE TWICE
SO FROM THIS POINT FORWARD IF I DON'T ANSWER YOUR MAIL THE ANSWER IS INTHE WALKTHROUGH AND YOU MISSED IT I
The Louvre Secrets Secrets will be indicated by surrounding stars and all capitalletters
eg SECRET Starting with the opening scene with Silas sitting on the bed carefullywatch the entire opening scenes
Take special note of the order in whicheach character appears in the opening sequence
I know its a little earlyto be talking about it now but this sequence of character appearance willbe important to you in the very last puzzle of the game You'll go through some more scenes and finally you will gain control You will get a phone call that doesn't make any sense to you and you willsay as much to Sophie
She will then slip you a business card
Go intoyour inventory and examine the business card and you will find a number onthe back of it
Then use the cell phone in your inventory and dial quot quot on the phone and there will be a message that will clear things up a bit You'll then end up in the bathroom with Sophie
Get the bar of soap fromthe counter go into your inventory and combine it with the tracking device Use the buttons you are instructed to to lift the window and throw theresulting device out
I have recieved numerous e mails about people not being able to get thiswindow open
You have to tap the button that appears at the bottom of thescreen REPEATEDLY until that icon turns bright green you have built up hisstrength then you must QUICKLY push up on both joysticks and the windowwill raise
If you don't push up quickly enough Langdon will lose hisstrength and you will have to start again
Get used to this procedure
You will be using it a lot in this game
Now you'll have a cryptogram puzzle
Rearrange the letters in quot OH LAMESAINT quot to make quot THE MONA LISA quot A clue Now you'll be Sophie and you'll have to creep towards the entrance wayto get the UV light from the Crime Investigators box
Just crouch andsneak past the first two guards and in the next room grab the pole on theground and sneak up behind the third guard staring into the box and clubhim quietly to the floor
Examine the box and you'll eventually findthe UV light
Poof You're standing in front of the Mona Lisa andLangdon is with you again Examine the Mona Lisa with the UV light and you'll see the cryptogram Use the UV light to highlight EVERY SINGLE character and it will switchyou over so you can solve the puzzle by replacing the symbols withletters
The solution will be DA VINCIPAINTED THOSETHAT KNEWBETWEEN BACCHUSAND URIEL LIESTHE CLUECongratulations you've solved the first of many cryptograms
Grab the SATURN SPHERE from the statue in the middle of the room IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Take note of the glowing symbol on the statue before you grab the item This is what you will look for to find further secret items
Now headout the door back into the main hall
Just outside the door you'llfind the paintings of both Bacchus and Uriel and a cutscene will ensue Examine the painting in between the two and you'll find something Lift Sophie up and she'll grab the PRIORY RING
More cutscene Now you'll be heading to Sauniere's office
Either hide out in the mainhall and sneak past the guards wait for them to walk out or doubleteam them and beat 'em up your choice
Go into the office the guardswon't return
Examine all the objects on the desk grab the smallbandage in the top right drawer if you need it
When you've done that move to the wall and examine the map with the UV light
Another clue Go to the air vent on the wall just to the left of the map and liftSophie up to climb in
She'll open up the Restoration room and let you in In here you'll need to examine another desk and read a note to learnabout mixing chemicals
Directly behind you on top of some boxes youcan find DA VINCI'S ARIAL SCREW There are no glowing symbols toindicate any of Da Vinci's contraptions you've actually gotta look forthose IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Now you want to head to the table with the chemicals on it and examinethat
Just to sort out what you read at the desk you want shot ofChitinase shot of Dismutase and shot of Catalase st nd and thchemicals and you'll have your mixture
Now look by a yellow toolboxand find the TOWEL
Combine the towel and the chemical
Take theresulting red rag and use it on the dirty painting
When the cutsceneis done grab a first aid kit from a corner of the room behind some tallpaintings and you can head out of this room
You're heading back downto the Mona Lisa room When you get back in there creep up the left side of the room becausea guard will come around from the right side of the Mona Lisa
Youwant to go where he came from you just want to get there from theleft side of the painting
Creeping will avoid having to deal with himat all
Go through the doorway behind the Mona Lisa and creep directlyto the left side of the two doorways and hide in that corner
In justa second the two guards in the next room will get called away and youcan cruise in there without having to deal with either of them
Thereis nothing of importance in that room so just run on through to theother side and you'll enter the Nike room Go down either stairwell it doesn't matter
When you get to the landingand start to go up the next set of stairs a guard will pop out frombehind the Nike Statue
If you're creeping then he won't see you andin just a second he'll turn his back to you and go up a set of stairsto the left
Creep up behind him and do the stealth knockout and youcan breathe relief
Examine the statue and learn stuff
Go back up tothe platform you knocked out the guard on and examine the display casethere
You'll see a round hole here
Be sure to pan the camera so thatthe round hole is in the center of the screen and is indicated as such atthe top of the screen
Use the PRIORY RING on it and a drawer will slideout to give you a FLEUR DE LIS DISC You're all done here and now its time to escape the Louvre
Go down tothe landing below the Nike statue and two guards will start to come uptowards you
Hide to the right wait for them to separate and you cantake them both out with stealth attacks
After both guards are knocked out look around on the lower landing the right side as you came down thestairs
You should see a glowing symbol on the wall as you turn tolook back up the stairs
Examine the railing and you'll find the LEAD COIN
Finally head carefully out the exit door there at thevery bottom
You'll see one guard but there are actually two
Creepup behind the statue to the left and if you're lucky you can take outone of them with a stealth attack but at a minimum you're going to endup fighting at least one of them so take them out
When they aredisposed of head to the exit and the level is over II
SAINT SULPICE Secrets Once the opening sequence is done you'll be standing in a bedroom
Thereis a small bandage on the table between the beds other than that thereis nothing useful in here at all
Head out and go to the bedroom straightacross
Examine the dead sister on the floor make sure you examine heroutstretched hand
Examine the desk and read stuff
The numbers quot quot are important
That's all you can do in here for now so go out of thisroom and go to the door to the right balcony and enter Cross the balcony to the other door there is nothing useful on thebalcony and enter
You find yourself in a closet so search around andbe sure to find the CAN OF OIL and the BOLT CUTTERS and then head backacross the balcony Back in the living quarters area head into the little alcove with the twodoors in it The door to your right is the sisters room and if you knock on her door she will give you hints but if you're using this guide you don't need her Go out the other door
First things first there is a creepy monk walkingaway from you
Simply creep up behind him and knock him out with astealth attack then search around this area don't go down the stairs yet and you'll find the diagram on the wall that tells you the letters thatcorresponds to symbols
Note this because you'll need this twice inthis level IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos or you can just keep using this walkthrough 'cause I'm gonna tell you anyway Head back to the room with the dead sister on the floor If you examined her hand earlier he said something about her pointingto the bed
Stand beside that bed and pull it out of the way
You willreveal a safe on the floor that has a slide puzzle lock
The center rowof the puzzle has symbols in the blocks underneath the slider tiles These tell you what letters should be in the center row using the earliernoted diagram
You want the center row to say quot SION quot IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos I generally hate these kind of puzzles but its already pretty close andyou can make that arrangement in about moves
Complete it and it willopen to give you the BRONZE SLIDE
Head back out to the area that had thealphabet diagram Now you can head down those steps and enter the door then you will gothrough yet another door and you'll be standing in one big a room There are two creepy monks walking around in here one of whom is rightin front of you with his back to you
Creep up behind him and stealthattack his butt
There is a large bandage in this area where youknocked him out behind a round concrete thingy with a cross on top
Theother creepy monk is way down near the other end of this giant room Hunt him down and take him out
There MAY be a third creepy monk inhere I forget but I don't think so
You may now freely explore thisvery large room
You can listen to the stories on all of the posts but note the little platform on the bottom of each one
Get the TIN COIN in the window of the dark alcove between 's IX and X IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos The quickest way to get this done is to go down to the end of the roombetween 's VII and VIII where you will find two fountains thatlook like seashells
In the fountain closest to you will find an ORNATEKEY
Grab this key and head all the way back up to the room with the deadsister and the quot under the bed quot puzzle
Use the ornate key on thearmoire
Once again be sure to center the camera on the keyhole of thearmoire
Look inside to find a small statue of Jesus after his death then head back down to the giant room I don't believe the creepy monks come back when you return so youshould be ok Now we're ready to finish up this room for such a largeroom there isn't a whole lot to do here
Go to the alcove between 's III and IV
Read the book there and then turn to the stonetablet on the floor and examine it
Using what you learned in the book you know that you have to turn the left dial to quot Aprilis quot and the rightdial to quot XI quot IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Just outside the alcove a piece of the floor will rise up and there youwill find another small statue of Jesus carrying the cross Now head down to the large double doors near pillar
You'll know youare at the right one because it is locked with a padlock
Yank out thetrusty BOLT CUTTERS and unlock the door
You will go up a short set ofstairs and enter another door
You are standing in front of the churchorgan
To your left there is a small bandage on the floor
Go to thecrank to the right of the organ and use it to change the clock to IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos A slot in the floor will open up in front of the organ keys and you willget the COPPER SLIDE
Now head back to the large pillar room Three creepy monks return in the pillar room when you return so do whatyou have to do to get rid of them Now go to pillar and examine it
Put the statue of Jesus carrying thecross on the platform
From there go to pillar and put the remainingstatue there IMAGEShttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos http www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos A trapdoor in the floor between pillars and will unlock and thatswhere we're going next
Open the trapdoor and enter You'll find yourself in a cave
There is a stack of boxes immediatelyto your right behind which you will find DA VINCI'S ORNITHOPTER IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Head around to the left to the stone table with the lanterns on it Stand behind the table and examine it
Use the can of oil on the oilvalve
Now open the lanterns and put the sliders that you found inthe appropriate lantern Put the BRASS SLIDE in the BRASS LANTERN etc and use the matches to light all the lanterns
You will now see theword quot JERUSALEM quot projected on the wall
That's a hint folks Now go to the crypt to the left of the lanterns left as you are lookingat the word projected on the wall and push it to the side
Behindit you will find a series of buttons with those symbols on them thatyou found in the alphabet diagram at the beginning of this level
Thesymbols all correspond to the letters in the word quot JERUSALEM quot and there fore need to be pushed in that order
Since there are two quot E's quot thefirst one you push is indicated by dot and the second indicated by dots To help you out I'll translate the buttons in the diagrambelow S E R J L A M E U When the puzzle is solved a door in the floor will open up and youwill get a list of all the Grand Masters of the Priory of Sion
Youwill never use this or hear mention of it again in the rest of the game so I'm not entirely sure why we had to go through all this except tobe able to move on to the next level of the game As soon as the cutscene is done two creepy monks will be heading towardsyou from the way you came in and they are blocking your hasty exit Since facing two of these guys in a fight when you are alone RARELYworks out in your favor hide behind the crypt opposite the buttonpuzzle
There is one of those golf club looking things on the floorthere for your convenience although I'm not sure what a golf club isdoing in an ancient crypt
Keep an eye on these two and when theyhead in separate directions do your best to creep up behind one of themand take him out with a stealth attack usually the easiest one to getis the one that heads towards the lanterns
You are then free to fightthe other monk as you wish
If you do manage to get discovered by bothmonks simply take the option to run away and get as far away as possible It doesn't take long for them to believe they lost you and resume theirpatrol Head out the way you came in after you've disposed of the monks Now that you've made it out of that trap and are back up in the large pillar room you will find that the game has kindly placed monks intothis room now
You can either carefully beat the crap out of all of themone at a time or slowly creep past all of them

either way yourgoal here is to get back to the door to head back upstairs
Once you'vechosen your method get to the door and head back up
You are going toknock on the door of the sisters room and get the cutscene that endsthe level
Yay you III
NORMANDY MANSION Secrets You begin facing the mansion
Don't worry about the dogs yet they're notcoming after you unless you go right up to them and you're not goingover there yet anyway
Go behind the shed to your right and climb inthe back window
As soon as you start to move the Creepy Monk Leader Silas will follow you in in a cutscene and then you'll have to beat himunconscious before you can do anything
Once he's out you need to goexamine the lockbox on the shelves next to the chalkboard with the numberson it
The numbers indicate the Fibonacci Sequence which is simply asequence in which the next number is the sum of the two numbers in frontof it
thus This being like ahint and all it means that the number you need to unlock the box isrelated to this
Quite simply you just need the next numbers in thesequence so it's solved like this or Unlock the box with the combination
Get the key found inside andleave the shed IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Time to deal with the dogs
Walk straight out from the shed to the otherbuilding and find the boarded up door at the end
You should be lookingalmost straight at it when you exit the shed
Break down the door Inside this small room locate the freezer that you can examine and getthe steak out from inside
Head back out of this little room and overto the open cage with the dog bowls in it
Put the steak in the bowl You only need to put it in one bowl the steak will appear in both bowlsafter you do it Walk out of the cage and turn to the left back towardsthe room with the freezers
You'll see a big square on the sidewalkthere its a shadow of the belfrey and there is a rope there
Pull therope and the bell will ring and the dogs will run up to eat
You arenow a friend to the dogs and they are no longer a threat Now you need to turn the bridge so you can get to the mansion so go downto the big spool just below the shed
Grab the crank and turn it to spinthe bridge around
NOTE This action is SUPER picky compared to everyother action you will do in this whole game
Do EXACTLY what the indicatoron the bottom of the screen is showing you


do not get ahead of it and don't fall to far behind what it is indicating
You will need to spinit times
It's annoying but keep trying
Once the bridge is spun head across to the mansion
Don't let the dogs upset you they're yourfriends now but it kind of freaked me out the first time I saw themrunning at me
Go up to the door and use the key you found in the shed Now that you are standing inside ignore the stairs in front of you for nowand head into the alcove on the left
Look in the cabinet you find thereand you will find the AENEAS STATUE
Go into the room opposite the cabinetwith the lions head with the fleur de lis discs over it
Notice that thereis a disc missing
Well now you know what to do with that disc you foundback in the Louvre but now she's crabbing about not remembering how theyare supposed to be rotated so we'll have to figure that out
Head towardsthe back of this room and look on a little table on the left side
Sittingright there in front of everybody with no puzzle or locks or cabinets oranything is the CUPID STATUE
Grab it
Keep going out the back of thisroom and head up the stairs you find here
You can examine the stainedglass windows here but at the moment it is meaningless to you so head allthe way to the top of the stairs
The PRIORY RING is what unlocks this door so unlock it and head in You find yourself in a bedroom wish I had a bedroom like that
First examine the bed and find DA VINCI'S TANK IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Now go to the dresser and examine it
There is a poem you need to read inthe top center drawer which gives you a clue as to how you are going torotate the discs downstairs
There is a large bandage in the middle draweron the right
The drawer on the bottom left is locked but once again thePRIORY RING is the key to unlock it
In that drawer you find the VULCANSTATUE
Now head back out the way you came in and go observe the stainedglass windows You'll see that each window has a God on it and Sophie will tell you thestory of each one
Each God has a fleur de lis symbol in a pane above itrotated in a certain direction
Each line of the poem you found in thedresser refers to one of these God's and your goal here is to figure outwhich God each line refers to and therefore which direction theirrespective fleur de lis is facing IMAGEShttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos http www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos It's all very confusing at first but for the purposes of this walkthrough head down to the fleur de lis discs over the lion's head and examine thediscs again
Turn them like this The direction refers to which way the TOP of the design faces DOWN RIGHT UP LEFTIMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos The lions mouth will open and give you the VENUS STATUE
Now head back upto the bedroom Go all the way through the bedroom and into the library on the other side Stay on the top level for now and go to the table you see to your left Look inside the box first and you'll get the JUPITER STATUE then read thenote on the table
After you've read the text of the note you'll get yoursecond cryptogram of the game
Give it a shot first hint the symbolsalways represent the same letter in EVERY cryptogram you will do in thewhole game but if you don't wanna this is what it says JUPITER ISABOVE VULCANAENEAS IS BELOWMARS MARS IS TOVULCANS RIGHTNow head down the stairs to the lower part of this library
Upon reachingthe bottom of the stairs you will be treated to another cutscene andanother quot You don't have any choice close quarters fight with a crazed monk quot Once you have disposed of the monk examine the table with the skeletonsitting on it like a monk fight spectator
Examine the funky UFO lookin'thing and a statue will roll out from under it
Move your gaze to the floorunder the table and pick up the MARS STATUE
Pick either door out of thisroom and make your way back to the stairs you saw when you first entered themansion and head up Halfway up there is a little overlook area with two paintings
Examine thepainting on the left and you'll find the JUPITER SPHERE
Now head therest of the way up the stairs to the room at the top In this room go to the round table with the pentacle on it and place all statues on it They will all line up on the platform on the left sideof the table
Once they are all there its time to place them all on thepentacle in the correct spot and facing the correct direction
Put themon the pentacle in THIS ORDER Put Aeneas on the lower right pointPut Mars on the upper right pointPut Cupid on the lower left pointPut Jupiter on the top pointPut Venus in the centerPut Vulcan in the upper left pointIMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos When you are done make sure that all the statues are FACING VENUS and thatVenus is facing Aeneas
You'll get a cutscene and when its over you'll bein the garden below The concept here is pretty simple its just a matter of getting it done
Thegarden is a big replica of the pentacle table you just completed
You simplyhave to go around the outside and rotate all the statues so that they faceVenus which is pretty easy considering that when the statue is facing theright way a big box pops up on the screen and tells you that its right The trick is the guards wandering around in there
Fortunately it does allow so that you only run into one guard at a time MOST of thetime
One time I did get snagged by two at once
and you can usuallysneak up on him and take him out with a stealth attack
Just be sure to dragthem out of the way so one of the other guards doesn't find him and wake himback up Metal Gear Solid flashbacks
The safest bet is to drag them to oneof the statues that you have to rotate

they don't go there on theirpatrol
Once you have them all turned the right way the Venus statue willrise up out of the ground to reveal an entranceway beneath it
Of course you should go there and enter So now you're in the quot Underground Grotto quot First there is a statue on either side of the room
Go to the one thatlooks like King Tut and take the TORCH You can examine the other statue butthere is nothing there to examine until the puzzle is completed and thenits a cutscene anyway so forget it
Light the torch on one of the flamingbirds
Now you can do what I did and run around for minutes justlighting torches until you get lucky and the puzzle solves itself or you cando this Starting from scratch before you've lit any torches imagine the torches ina clock format
When you walk in the room the one furthest from you beingthe o'clock position illustrated as shown below door you come in IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Now light the torches in this order oclock oclock oclock oclock oclock oclock oclock Many thanks to 'maceasar' on the IGN Message Boards for this descriptionof solving the puzzle
A cutscene ensues the LASER ETCHED KEY is retrieved and the level is over IV
BANK OF ZURICH Secrets If I had to pick which level is quot Chock full O' guards quot this is it so ifyou don't like the guard fights and creeping around go ahead and mentallyprepare yourself now First thing you're going to do is talk to the guard at the main desk andhe'll point you through the door on the right
Go through the two doors hereand you'll be in the quot Atrium quot
There is nothing to find on this level andthe only door you can go through is the one in the center on the left side so just head there and go in Speaking to the guard here is useless unless you just want to hear him saystuff that only borders on funny so you can skip him and go to the gate anduse your newly aquired LASER ETCHED KEY to get in
Once the gate is open there is an open room right in front of you to go in
Don't bother exploringthe hallway there is nothing there In this new room you will again use the laser etched key to retrieve yourbox o' goodies but to your surprise it gets there and THEN it decidesto let you know you need a password
Then you have cutscenes telling youabout the symbol on your box of goodies and what numbers it represents andthe Fibonacci Sequence and and and and blah blah blah so itsgoing to make you do math again but at least its math you can do in yourhead because you only need a digit number this time so this you know already How about that
A digit number
quot quot is your password so enter it andthe box o' goodies is yours
Inside you get the Cryptex and no clue how toopen it


SWEEEEEEET
not Examine the box again and you will find that there is a tiny hole in thesmaller box that contained the Cryptex but you need something to poke intothe hole
Well of all things suddenly you can examine the desk on the leftside of this room
Open the drawer and inside you'll get a paper clip
Ofcourse Sophie will tell you how very perfect that is so go and use it onthe little hole in the Cryptex case
You get a lovely little poem that ifyou know anything at all about quot The Da Vinci Code quot even if you've only seencommercials or it could be you are over years old and you are a MontyPython fan you know boils down to one word quot GRAIL quot Go into yourinventory and chose the Cryptex and quot use quot it
Enter the word quot GRAIL quot andyou're on your way
The bank manager comes in and very kindly tells you toget the hell out and he's going to help you do it without getting busted After the cutscene head out the way you came in but when you get back tothe quot Atrium quot head to the left and around to the elevators
Use the securitycard the bank manager just gave you on the elevator
A cutscene lets youknow that this is the last friendly guard you're gonna see on this level because this guy is too stupid to know he's supposed to be pissed at you yet When you're in the elevator you're told that you're screwed and you need toget out of there before the elevator opens so lift Sophie through the doorin the top of the elevator and up you both go
Once there turn the crankyou see on the wall to open the doors Head to the right out of the elevator
There are two guards patrolling thisfloor
Go into the first set of doors you come to which should put you ina storage closet
Look around in here and you'll find a large bandage andyou should see the eerie glow of one of the secret items so of course search the shelves to find the MARS SPHERE
Exit the closet IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos At this point what you do with the guards is up to you
What you want to dois continue along this side of the Atrium to the doors further down the hall If you can get there and into the Admin Office without messing with theguards good for you if not try to only have to get rid of one of them Enter the Admin Office In here there are two more guards
Sophie will not follow you in here soyou are on your own for fighting so just don't fight
Immediately crouchand look straight ahead and a guard will pass from right to left
Sneak upbehind him and stealth attack him and knock him cold
Move up a littlefurther and look to your right around the cubicles and you'll see anotherguard on patrol
If you crept up correctly you should be able to sneak upon him and do the same thing you did to the first guard in here
If not just fight him and take him out
You are now free to explore and do yourthing on your own time in here First thing we'll do is take care of one of the two hardest secrets in thegame to find
If you go to the door you came into this room and turnaround and look into the room just as you did when you came in you need togo all the way to the back of the room to the furthest cubicle on the RIGHT
If this description confuses you just check each of the four corner cubiclesand you've got a one in four chance of hitting it
At least you won't have tosearch all of them like I did and finally find it in the last one you check
Go in the cubicle and you'll get the quot examine quot cue
Examine the shelf hereand you'll get DA VINCI'S BALLISTA
If you choose to find this cubicleby looking at the map on the wall to either side of the door it will be thecubicle in the lower right corner
IMAGEShttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos http www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Now you have to go to the Administrator's office
As you came in its on theleft side near the back and you have to walk through a smaller office withabout cubicles in it to get to the Admin Office
Does this mean theAdministrator has secretaries
This guy can DELEGATE
Once in theAdmin office go to the desk and insert the security card after the bankmanager gives you the code
Enter the code quot quot and it will be wrong TRIVIA NOTE For those of you who might be fan's of 's music notethat this passcode is the first digits of the song quot Jenny quot that Tommy Tutone topped the charts with in
I have yet toconfirm if this was on purpose or if its a freaky coincidence
Is myage showing
so the manager tells you to check out the Office Managers office
As youstand the Office Managers office is directly across the main cubicle roomfrom you so head out and go across and enter the Office Manger's office Search the desk first
There is a large bandage in the bottom left drawerand a password in the middle right drawer
When you're done with the desk turn around and examine the painting with the UV light
Examine thefingerprints you find
Now you can lift the painting and reveal the safethat is hidden behind it
Use the password you found in the drawer to openthe safe quot quot
Take the FILE CABINET KEY you find inside and leave thatoffice Go to the right and enter the file room at the end
Go all the way to theback of the room to the last set of free standing file cabinets IE Not theones against the wall and find the set that allows you to quot examine quot
Unlockthe top drawer with the key you just obtained from the safe and get thepassword
Go back to the Admin Office Put the security card back in the computer and enter the code that you foundin the file cabinet quot quot
Head out of here and back towards the door youcame in here from and find the Security Card Reader in that corner
Use thesecurity card and move to the stairwell
When you get to the bottom you'llgo through another door and end up on the lower floor of the quot Atrium quot
Sophiebegins to follow you again when you head down the stairs
Wasn't she helpful
There are guards here but if you immediately crouch and head to the left you'll end up near a door that says it is quot Deposits and Servers quot or somethingto that effect
Enter that door and go down a long hallway that has nothingin it but doors you can't open until the last door on the left
Go throughthat door down a little hallway past an unmanned security desk and throughanother door
You end up in a small break room
Walk through it and you'llbe in a big quot privacy cubicle quot room
Walk all the way to the far side of thisroom and peek to your left and you'll see the two guards in this room
It'sup to you how you handle those two because I knocked them both out when I wassearching for secrets but it is possible to get through the room without theguards even knowing you're there As you come in this room the place you want to be is the other corner ofthis room directly to your left there is a security card reader and anotherdoor in this corner
There is a privacy room you can enter closest to thesecurity card reader however the secret you want is in the privacy roomdirectly BEHIND it
In other words check the two privacy rooms closest tothe card reader you'll see the glowing symbol on the wall when you go in Get the IRON COIN IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos On the same wall as the door by the card reader there is an air vent
Gothere and you will be prompted to shove Sophie through it
Do so You are now in a small server room and a guard will walk up between theservers and turn his back to you
Creep up on him and take him out with astealth attack
Go to the left from here and you'll find a set of doors andan office with no door
Creep into the office because there is a guardstanding there with his back to you
Take him out with a stealth attack You can now upgrade your security card once again at the computer found inthis office
Just stick it in


no password or puzzle necessary Go back out of this office and through the doors right beside it
Go downthe short hallway outside the card upgrade office and open the door at theother end with the security card
Langdon will meet you there and you'll beback in the quot privacy cubicle quot room
Leave here the way you came in and goback to the quot Atrium quot When you're back in the Atrium there are two guards here but there is noneed to even mess with them
Simply crouch turn to the right and follow thewall around to the loading dock door
You've got time and space here solisten to the guards conversation for a giggle if you want
If not go aheadand enter the loading dock area You'll be in a sitting room with a security card reader and a caged off door Use your upgraded card in the card reader and the cage will raise
Creepthrough the doorway quick enough and there will be a guard walking awayfrom you that you can sneak up on and take out with a stealth attack
Asyou now stand you should now see a guard just standing there and lookingto your left
Believe it or not you can crouch and sneak up beside and thenbehind him and take him out with a stealth attack the guys gotta be BLIND
There is a small bandage in the closet behind that guard
Now look downwhere that guard was looking and you'll see a guard waaaaaaay down on theother end
He does pace back and forth so I suppose you COULD sneak up onhim but its quicker just to run up fight him and knock him out The arrow on the floor points you out the door so follow it
Go to the endof that hall use the Vehicle Key on the doors and the level is over V
CHATEAU VILLETTE Secrets This level has only one enemy and you don't see him till the end so in themeantime we'll have to endure the fact that Teabing is longwinded and justget through this
When you finally have control after the cutscenes thefirst thing I recommend that you do Only if you want all the secrets istake the steps down into the basement
Go through the door and the basementis to your left
Go to the back left corner of the basement look for theglowing symbol and there are some chairs there that let you quot examine quot them You'll find the COPPER COIN there
Go back upstairs to the room everyoneis standing in IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Listen to Teabing babble and observe the two paintings on the wall
Whenhe's done you can either go to each shield at the back of the room andlisten to Teabings story or you can listen long enough to find quot Gallahad's quot shield and quot Percival's quot shield
In either case it is the shield furthestto the left in both sets
Gallahad's shield is a red cross Percival'sshield is the Heart Grab Gallahad's shield and put it on the Knight closest to the painting ofthe knight looking at the Angels Grab Percival's shield and put it on the Knight closest to the painting ofthe knight looking at the castle and the Grail floating in the sky IMAGEShttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos http www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Doors will open

Go over to Percival's Room and read the Bible onthe bookcase
Go back to Gallahad's Room and enter quot HEAR quot as the passwordon the security door

Basically after you have observed and heardabout the following items you'll be done The quot V Shape quot The quot Grail quot quot John is Mary quot The quot M Shape quot quot Peter mad at Mary quot The quot Grail quot again quot Jesus and Mary quot Apparently now you have all you need to solve Cryptex so go in yourinventory use Cryptex and put in quot MAGDALENE quot Large cutscene here with the Creepy Monk Silas and now you'll have to sendparts to the basement to complete a weapon

In there you will find DAVINCI'S PADDLEBOAT on top of the file cabinets just to your right insideIMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos the door
Go back in by the guard you knocked out and enter the door justto the right of the television You are in a large sanctuary with a crypy to your left
There are two guardsin the crypt having a conversation
Wait for them to finish and quietly takethem both out with stealth attacks when they go their separate ways
Thereis still one guard left in the main sanctuary area
Sneak around and take himout too You are now free to roam but not much you need
In the main sanctuary thereare two cabinets in opposing corners
One has doors on it and the otherdoes not
The one that has doors on it has only a SMALL GEAR grab it and goto the other corner
In that cabinet that has no doors get another SMALLGEAR and a large bandage Go back over to the crypt area where you took out the first two guards andturn to your left
You will find a desk that has a LARGE GEAR on it
Headback to the door and go back down to where you were held prisoner
When yougo back in this room go to the right and find the gearbox
In yourinventory you should have large gear and small gears
You may rearrangethe gears you see in the gearbox but this should be your final result ssL Ex Ls s Sw s small gearL larger gear Ex Exit gear Sw Switch gearIMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos When you get it right pull the switch and you'll get a cutscene and you'll beSophie again CHANGE CHARACTERS AND BE SOPHIE All you have to do here is be sneaky and take out the two guards
Wait inthe archway that you start in and listen to the conversation that the guardsare having on the radio absolutely hysterical
The guards will then walkby you to the right and then very quickly turn around and walk back towhere they came from
As they pass back by sneak up behind them and knockthem out
Enter the basement door when they are taken care of
Thats it you're done
You join Langdon in the basement Now that you have Sophie with you you can take her down the long hallway inthis room and open the door to the tunnels catacombs
Once inside thetunnels there is a small bandage just to your left in the little alcove
Letthe two guards have their conversation and when they are done talking theywill split up
Now you can creep down and stealth attack the first guard Continue on down the tunnel and beat up the next guard as well Carefully continue through the tunnels until you come up on more guards andlet them finish talking as well
Let the first guard come to you and thensubdue him
Look in the crypts on the wall in this area should be on yourleft as you are walking through the tunnels and you should find your firstTEMPLAR SEAL
Now you need to move up and dispose of the remaining guard Move a little further along the tunnels and look for a crypt on your rightwith a cardboard box in it
Move the box and get the second TEMPLAR SEAL Continue through the tunnels until you get to one lonely guard complainingabout the electrical switch
Creep up on him and stealth attack him
Nowyou get a brief very brief break from the guards
Examine the electricalbox on the wall
There are green buttons inside that you need to push inthe correct order to get them all to light up
Remember this order becauseyou will need it later several times when you are in a panicked state IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Push them in that order and the power will turn on for the switch right nextto you
Pull the switch and enter the room that opens for you
Grab thesmall bandage and the third TEMPLAR SEAL
Check your inventory and make sureyou have all TEMPLAR SEALS
You are going back through the tunnels the wayyou came now so if you don't have them all you can pick up what you missedon the way Go back through the tunnels carefully because guards will reappear for yourfighting pleasure
Do away with these guards and return to the switch onthe wall in the area you found these guards
Pull the switch and enter thelittle room that opens for you
You have a disc puzzle in front of you verysimilar to the one you found in Normandy Mansion only its not nearly ascomplicated to figure out Put the three TEMPLAR SEALS you found into the empty spaces in the puzzle The way the seals need to be turned is very easily painted on the walls toeither side of the puzzle
I will use clock positions to tell you how eachdisc should be turned since this puzzle doesn't have straightforward up downtype positions
Turn them like this from left to right the clock positionrefers to where the TOP of the seal should be O'clock o'clock o'clock o'clock For the really observant among you if you looked at the monument in thecourtyard of the church when you first started the level you may have noticedthat there were templar seals on it numbered I IV
Those seals wererotated the way you will have to rotate them here
IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Now you'll get a cutscene showing you that you've revealed something up in thecourtyard where this level first started so you're going to continue backthrough the tunnels the way you came in
You will come across two guards onyour way back but there will be more if either of those guards find andawaken any of the guards you knocked out on the way in so get out of therefairly quickly When you exit the tunnels back in the room where Langdon was held prisoner the guard Langdon knocked out when he escaped his cell will be there waitingfor you and he won't be happy
Take him out and go out the door near the TVto go back up to the church sanctuary When you get there use the combined efforts of Langdon and Sophie to unlockand open the front door of the church that you see on your right and exitout into the courtyard you started the level in
Go to the monument straightin front of you and look around the bottom of it for the item you revealedwith the Templar Seal puzzle
Get the METAL SHARD After you have the shard guards will run across the courtyard after you Take care of them as you see fit and return inside the church through thefront door Go to the left into the room with all the crypts on the floor and in the rightrear of this room you will find a shield with two pieces missing
Put theROUGH METAL SHARD in the top space and the SHARP METAL SHARD in the bottomspace and the shield will be whole again revealing a code of paired symbols You don't need to write this down as it will be shown to you when you need it Look at the crypts in the room and find the one that says quot Dark Effigy quot whenyou approach it
When you examine it it will say quot Here lies W Marshall quot andthen you will be presented with a chart and the shield you need to decode Use the paired symbols on the shield to find the correct letters on the chartand fill in the blank spaces at the bottom
When you finish the word willspell out quot RICHARD quot Now you can go into your inventory and solve the rd Cryptex with the word quot RICHARD quot You'll get a cutscene in which you'll discover that you've been duped
Enjoythe cutscene or skip it but be prepared when its over because the CreepyMonk Leader will be chasing you with a gun
Yes only Langdon
Not sureexactly where Sophie disappeared to or how you ended up back in the tunnels but yet here you are
What you have to do here is just RUN
You will get a crappy camera angle witha view of the crazed monk shooting at you from behind
Run away from himuntil you get to a door that you need to break down
Do it quickly andcontinue to run
Next you'll come to another door with one of thoseelectrical boxes and a switch
Solve the electrical box with the solutionI gave you earlier pull the switch and then run some more The next door you come to will be one that you have to break down again
Doit and keep running
You come to another electrical box switch door so dothem again but this time the door will only go halfway up
Quickly grab thedoor and pull it the rest of the way up by hand then run again The next door you come to will just be halfway up so just grab it and liftit up by hand and run some more and you'll come to another half opened doorwhere you will do the same thing and keep on running The last door you come to will be the electrical box switch type door
Getit opened by the prescribed method and enter it for the cutscene
In totalthere are doors you have to get through
Thankfully while you are running the crazed monk is walking so you get enough time to get through them all but here is an abbreviated list of the doors you have to go through
Break through door
Electrical Box Switch door
Break through door
Electrical Box Switch broken door then lift
Half open door

Now this level is over VIII
Westminster Abbey Secrets This level looks kind of intimidating but its really not that bad
Firstthing you need to do is turn and look at the directory to get an idea ofwhere you will be going
Go behind the directory first towards the frontdoors of Westminster Abbey and look towards the statue on the left for theglowing symbol that indicates a secret
Examine that area to find the GOLD COIN
That is the only secret out in this main area so we'll pickup the other two on our way through the level IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Check the directory and find your way to quot Newton's Tomb quot
As soon as youenter this room you will get a hint about electricuting the patrollingguard
Do as suggested and shove the light into the puddle of water butdo it fairly quickly as the guard will eventually walk out of the puddle andthen you'll have to kick his butt as you normally would
Go straight acrossthe room to the opposite side and look on the wall for the glowing symbolof secrets
Examine that area to get the SUN SPHERE
Just started andalready you got secrets
IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Now walk over to Newton's Tomb and examine it thoroughly
When it has beencompletely examined and you are staring at it wondering what to do use thePRIORY RING in the little hole next to the Sun and you will be able to takethe sun off the tomb and add it to your inventory
That Priory Ring is handyas hell Listen to them babble for a bit and head out of this room back tothe main area Use the directory if you need to but you want to go to quot Chaucer's Tomb quot Examine this tomb and note the characters from Canterberry Tales across thetop of the tomb
You will need to know one of them to solve this puzzle Examine down near the bottom of the tomb and find the slider puzzle with theshield engraving in the middle
Place the Sun Orb on the shield engraving toactivate the slider puzzle
It's pretty easy to solve as you have to getthe letters to spell out quot PARDONER quot clockwise around the puzzle starting fromthe top left square IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Simply slide the quot D quot into the center and the rest of the letters will slideright into place so you can slide the quot D quot right where it is supposed to beand the puzzle will be solved
You will be presented with the LARGE RINGfor your efforts Now that you have completed that lets save you some running around and graba nearby item that you will need later
You are standing next to whereShakespeare's Memorial should be but there is a sign saying that it isbeing renovated
Right next to that area you will find a quot Workman's Cabinet quot Examine the cabinet and you will find and old coat inside
Slide the coatto the side and you will get a BRUSH added to your inventory
Now if you knowthe way head to quot The Cloister quot
Check the directory if you don't know howto get there When you enter the Cloister creep straight ahead and there will be a guard infront of you
Look a little to the left and Langdon will proclaim that maybehe can untie the light on the ceiling and it will drop on the guard
Do justthat and grab the large bandage that you find there as well
Continue downthat hall and enter the quot Restoration Hall quot on your left near the end There are guards in this hallway
Try to take them out with stealthattacks by turning on the light switches you can find on either side of thehallway otherwise if all guards come after you you are unlikely to beatthem
The third guard is near the end of this quot L quot shaped hallway near acloset with a closed door
Enter the closet and find a large bandage and alight switch
Flip the switch and a guard will walk out of the Restorationroom at the end of the hall
Run out and take care of him before he wakesup any of the bodies you've left laying around the hall
When the guards areall sleeping peacefully enter the Restoration room at the end of the hall Just inside the door to the right is a pallet that you can examine
Searchit and find BOLT CUTTERS inside one of the boxes
Look to the other side ofthe door you came in and look for two boxes covered with blue cloths rightnext to each other
Walk around them until you get the cue to quot examine quot andyou will be rewarded with DA VINCI'S CODEX ARUNDEL
You can't doIMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos anything else in this room at the moment but go and examine Shakespeare'sStatue before you leave if you feel like it
Head back out of the RestorationHall to the Cloister and back towards the door you came in but instead ofleaving turn to your left and go down the previously unexplored hallway There will be guard wandering around down here so just take him out inwhatever way you like best and proceed all the way to the end of the hall tofind a padlocked door
Use the BOLT CUTTERS to unlock the door and enter thiscloset The closet is dark so examine the pallet just inside the door and slide abox to the side to reveal the light switch and turn on the lights
Searchunder the workbench until you find MARBLE CLEANER
You are done in here sogo aaaaaaaaall the way back to the Restoration Room where Shakespeare's Statuewas
When you get there there will be a single guard wandering around theroom
He's pretty easy to creep up on and take out with a stealth attack Do that and go over and examine Shakespeare's Statue
Go in your inventoryand combine the MARBLE CLEANER and the BRUSH
Use the resulting soapy brushon the scroll on the statue and reveal the quote
Note the word thatShakespeare is pointing to quot TEMPLES quot
Now examine Shakespeare's finger andplace the LARGE RING on it
A drawer will slide out and you will be rewardedwith a HAND CRANK You are done here so you are going to head all the way back to the main areaof Westminster Abbey
You will encounter guard on the way back in the hallin the Cloister so take him out on the way When you are back in the main area head over to King Henry III's Tomb if youknow the way check the directory if you don't Examine King Henry's Tomb and you will find a hole into which you can insertthe HAND CRANK
The word Shakespeare was pointing to is your clue so crankthe letters around until it says quot TEMPLES quot IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Your efforts will reward you with the KING SYMBOL Now turn around and examine the scaffold behind you
Examine the two wheelswith locks on them and unlock them
Now you can push the scaffold to the sideto reveal the door to Saint John's Chapel
Use the BOLT CUTTERS to unlockthis gate and enter Saint John's Chapel In here search through the box on the floor and once you've emptied it you'll find a first aid kit
Now go examine Baron Hunsden's Tomb in thisroom
Put the KING SYMBOL in the empty space that you find
Use the clueto figure out the sequence in which to push the buttons you now have in frontof you or just read the sequence I have provided for you here because the clueyou have is terribly confusing
Push the buttons in this order QUEENBARONKNIGHTSOLDIERYou will be presented with the UNUSUAL CYLINDER
A guard has now entered theroom and you will have to induce his coma so you can get out of here
Whenyou have made it back out to the main area of Westminster Abbey you need tohead back to the very first room you explored in this level Newton's Tomb When you enter Newton's Tomb again there will once more be a guard wanderingaround in here but electrocuting him is not presented as an option this time so you'll just have to kick his butt
Once that is done examine the tombonce again
In your inventory combine the UNUSUAL CYLINDER and the SUN ORB Place the resulting object SUN ORB CYLINDER in the Sun Orb Cavity on thetomb
A drawer will slide open to reveal a torn scroll
Take the tornscroll you already have in your inventory I don't know how it got thereeither and place it in the empty space below the torn scroll you just found Now you will have a scrambled up picture to assemble
Generally speaking thetop and bottom row of the picture should be fairly easy to identify so putthat together first and assemble the rest of the picture
There isn't reallya quot way quot to do this puzzle you just have to use your eyes until it is puttogether correctly
This is probably the most requested image in the whole game
Be sure to clickon the image in the gallery for the x version if you need a closerlook http www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos Once it is done you get the word you need to solve the fourth and finalCryptex quot PAYENS quot Instead of getting to solve the Cryptex though you'll be subjected to a verylongwinded cutscene in which you find out that Teabing has screwed you over During this long oration from Teabing you will be presented with differentthings for Sophie to say to Teabing to distract him so that Langdon has sometime to solve the Cryptex The first response you need to use is quot I thought you told us only the worthy can find the grail quot You will then switch to Langdon and the Cryptex
You need to rotate it asquickly as possible to say quot PAYENS quot
You will probably not get to finishthe first time so get as far as you can until you are returned to the cut scene The next time you need to respond use quot You are the one responsible for my grandfather's murder quot You will now return to the Cryptex to pick up where you left off
I managedto get the Cryptex finished during this turn so it just returned to the cut scene to let it finish out the level but if you need one more go at it youwill be given another opportunity to respond to Teabing This response will be quot You are no better than the church quot If you sill have not finished the cryptex you will be given a fourth and finalchance to get it done
Listen further to the cutscene and shortly you willbe presented with the last list of responses This response is quot and now you have taken over where the church left off quot Thank you to Janica Aniceto for writing to me from the Phillipines to giveme this th response
After that listen through the rest of the cutscene to the end of the level IX
ROSSLYN CHAPEL Secret For being the last level of the game this is certainly the easiest
Thereare no guards no crazed monks and no friends to stab you in the backanymore
In fact there is no creeping fighting or hiding at all in thislevel
You are just here to follow clues and solve puzzles just the wayThe Da Vinci Code was intended First go into the foyer of the church the area where the front doors are Examine the Baptismal there and take the STONE LID from it
Turn around andlook behind you and examine the wooden chest being sure to examine the dragmarks on the floor in front of it
Now you can pull the wooden chest awayfrom the wall and find a loose stone underneath it
Pick up the loose stoneand you will find a DAISY DISC Go back into the main area of the chapel and go over to the red curtain onthe right wall
Pull the rope to open the curtain
Place the STONE LIDin the empty space you find here and you will retrieve the LILY DISC Now return towards the rear of the church and examine the Angels on theback wall
Grab the box of matches from underneath the quot Faith quot Angel
Nowgo to the red curtain on the other side of the sanctuary and pull the rope toopen that curtain
Use the matches on the candle you find there then readthe inscription for a clue Return to the back wall and closely examine the quot Truth quot Angel and help Sophieretrieve the ROSE DISC from it Now go up to the front of the sanctuary and examine the altars on the frontwall
There is nothing in the left and center altars but in the right altaryou will find and read the quot Ceiling Journal quot
Note the following things fromit Daisies InnocenceLilies PuritySunflowers AdorationRoses LoveStars in the sky crescent moon one small star a dove a sun and anopen hand underneath Now you can walk around this room and let Langdon tell Sophie about the pillars at the front of the room or you can just move on to the gate with theStar of David on it so you can get out of here
Examine the Star of Davidgate and you will see the various characteristics on it with a littlespace underneath it
We are only worried about of them Put the DAISY DISC in the quot Innocence quot spacePut the LILY DISC in the quot Purity quot spacePut the ROSE DISC in the quot Love quot spaceA cutscene will open the door and you can now go down into the Sacristy As you enter the Sacristy read the memorial on your right
Go up to thefront of this room and observe the globe on the right
Be sure to spinthe globe so that you find that it is missing a piece
Now return to theend of this room and go down the short hallway you find on the right Examine the quot Bleeding Angel quot on the wall and retrieve the ODDLY SHAPED STONE This is of course the missing piece of the globe you just looked at soreturn to the globe and put the ODDLY SHAPED STONE into the globe where itbelongs
The globe will now open and give you the STAR DISC Go back down the short hall past the quot Bleeding Angel quot and into the next room In here you find a stone slab and a wicker box
Push the wicker box out ofthe way to reveal the trap door beneath it which you can't open yet examine the stone slab and use the STAR DISC in the appropriate place andanother scrambled picture puzzle will reveal itself
This one is REAL EASYbecause the borders of the picture make it obvious where most of the piecesgo and then you just have to arrange the center pieces
It should befairly obvious that you are assembling the picture that was described earlierin the level in the quot Ceiling Journal quot IMAGEhttp www northsearesearch com dvcgallery displayimage php album amp pos When the puzzle is completed the trapdoor will unlock and you can open itand enter the final area of the game Before you do anything else in here go to the far corner of the room near astack of chairs and find the last secret of the game DA VINCI'S CODECATLANTICUS
Now all you have left to do is examine the two murals on thewall in here and then examine the photo album and its contents
When you'vedone that put the controller down and watch the closing cutscene Congratulations you have completed quot The Da Vinci Code quot X
THE LOUVRE REVISITED This level is an extra awarded to you after completing the game
There areno enemies to fight or secrets to find
In here you simply return to TheLouvre and get to examine all the paintings

They don't have to be donein any particular order because they are just there for the puzzle loversamong you
These puzzles were unlocked by finding the secrets within thegame
There are puzzles in the main hall and in the Mona Lisa room HINTS TO HELP YOU The quote the cryptograms reveal are simply dialouge that you heard in cut scenes that you saw in each level so if you're the type that skips thesecutscenes you'll find these cryptograms a little more difficult Note that the same symbols represent the same letters in every singlecryptogram
For example the symbol that looks like the letter quot B quot that fellover onto its humps represents the letter quot T quot in EVERY puzzle FOR THE COMPLETELY LAZY OR TOTALLY STUMPED This is quite simply the solutions to all the puzzles The Louvre Museum Painting YOU SHOULD NOTHAVE RUNMONSIEURSAUNIERE NOWTELL ME WHEREIT ISSt

The important thingto note here is that if you have not found ALL of the secrets in the game then not all of the things in this level will work
It breaks down likethis The rotating solar system will not be rotating and you will not be ableto examine it if you have not found all the SPHERES The coins on the table will not play music tracks if you have not foundall of the COINS You will not be able to go into the underground library if you have notfound all of DA VINCI'S INVENTIONS You will not be able to go upstairs unless you have all the secrets Please do not write to tell me that Rosslyn Revisited is not working foryou
If it isn't working you aren't finished with everything
End ofstory
Do not write me angry e mails because you didn't finish everythingand Rosslyn Chapel isn't working for you
I've given you all theinformation you needed in this walkthrough to get everything If Rosslyn Revisited isn't working for you it's YOUR fault
I dideverything described in this walkthrough and it all worked for me The rotating solar system model where the globe was during the game allowsyou to play various music tracks from the game by clicking on the coinsthat you found that are now on the base of the solar system model andexamining the Sun gives you a full screen view of the solar system In the room that had the trap door in the floor there is a table that willdisplay all of Da Vinci's invention models that you found during the courseof the game Take the trapdoor down to the lower room and in here you will find allthe concept art that you unlocked by finding the secrets during the game Originally I didn't even bother to try to go upstairs into the mainsanctuary of the church because I figured if they wanted me to be there they would have started me in there just like the normal level did butafter recieving an e mail from a reader All he gave me were the intitialsB G
So Thank you B G
I found that there is a whole big puzzle up there Several actually but they all add up to one final one so here goes thesolution s Up in the area where the altars are the one on the right is JACQUES SAUNIERE SAINT CLAIRThe one on the left is REMY LEGALUDECThe one just outside of this area is SOPHIE NEVEU SAINT CLAIRAs you look at the back wall under the Angel Statues the one on the right is BEZU FACHEthe one on the left is SILASThe one right by the Star of David Gate is SISTER SANDRINE BIEILLooking at the two in the center of the room the one on the right is LEIGH TEABINGand the one on the left is of course ROBERT LANGDONAs you solved each one you may have noticed that you got a box on the screenthat repeated the name for you and added a title to them JACQUES SAUNIERE SAINT CLAIR The KingREMY LEGALUDEC The MerchantSOPHIE NEVEU SAINT CLAIR The QueenBEZU FACHE The SoldierSILAS The PriestSISTER SANDRINE BIEIL The BardLEIGH TEABING The BaronROBERT LANGDON The KnightGo to the table in between the Langdon and Teabing anagrams in the center ofthe room and examine it
You will find buttons corresponding to the titlesgiven to the characters above and a note lying on the table above the buttons Read the note and it gives you the clue as to what order to push the buttons You have to push the button that corresponds to each character in the order theyfirst appeared IN THE GAME
I have to clarify the quot IN THE GAME quot part becauseI received several e mails telling me that quot thats NOT how they appeared in themovie or the book or whatever Hopefully you did as I told you at the very beginning of the game
In fact itwas the very first paragraph of the walkthrough
Using the opening cutscene you should know in what order the first characters appear
After that itshould be real easy to figure out the last being that you next see SisterSandrine in level and then you need only figure out what order you met Remyand Teabing in level You will now push the buttons in this order PRIESTKNIGHTSOLDIERKINGQUEENBARDMERCHANTBARONThe Blacksmith button will never be used The game then tells you that everything in the visual database has beenunlocked
This means that all the data in your L menu is now availablefor you to go through
For those of you playing on XBox or PC its themenu where you can go through and read about the characters art history go over the clues you've recieved and see how many of the secrets you havepicked up
Once again there you are just wandering around Rosslyn Chapelwith no forseeable end so you can now save and exit Again thanks to B G
for pointing out to me that I missed this whole section and thanks to Google for helping me find all of the complete names that I hadnot heard before It would seem you are done with the game

FAQ I've put together this page to help answer some of the questions thatyou kind folks have asked me via e mail since I have posted this walkthrough The question as it was written to me is here as well as the answer that Ie mailed back
These are good questions that warranted an appropriateresponse Please note that if you don't see your question here the reason may be thatit is a stupid question
In which case you will find it on the Dumb FAQ
Iused to believe that the only stupid question is the question that is notasked
Since writing this walkthrough I've found this theory to be completebull amp Q quot Wow
You don't write like a year old hard core gamer that lives withtheir parents and has nothing but time on their hands
Your teachers must bevery proud of you quot A Indeed years ago my teachers were quite proud of me
or of themstill are
I am in fact years old do not have nothing but time on my handsand have to compete with three kids ages for the Playstation
I finishedthe game the first time with about hours total playing time and wrote thefirst draft of the completed walkthrough from memory in about hours
I'vereached the point now where I can complete the game including both Revisitedlevels in just over hours Q You are an incredible writer and you make me HOT
Will you marry me andlet me have your children A Yes however my wife insists on being the Maid of Honor and that shevideotape the conception of the children Q quot When I am in the Catacombs in Temple Church and I am trying to leave thetunnels there are three guards that attack me before I can get to the door
Ican't beat them and the game won't allow me to open the door
What do I do I'm extremely frustrated with this quot A Then there are two ways to approach heading out of here Run like hell back towards the beginning so the new guards don't have achance to find any guards to wake up or Be patient carefully head back toward the beginning and draw the guardsto you by so you don't get beat to death by a large group I don'trecommend trying to fight more than guards at once While Sophie'sassistance in a on fight is at best a decent distraction while you takeout guard and at worst she just plain gets in the way in a on fightyou don't have a chance
Be patient draw them to you or at a time andyou'll make it through I promise Q quot I found the UV light to discover the symbols written on the protectingglass in front of quot La Joconde Mona Lisa quot but there is something missing I've passed almost hours for searching what could be missing quot A You must pass the UV light over EVERY SINGLE SYMBOL on the Mona Lisabefore you will be given the cryptogram Q quot I have got to the Nike room and have followed your instruction in yourwalkthrough regarding the use of the Priory ring to open the display case butam having problems opening it Langdon keeps repeating phrases that it isn'tthe right thing to do and Sophie suggests looking around the room

I have been recieving a LOTof e mail and I'm the type of person who has to answer EVERY SINGLE ONE it isjust the kinda guy I am and I wouldn't sleep if I didn't answer one not thatI sleep anyway
Far too many of the questions have been things that wereanswered in the walkthrough and either because the individual read too quicklyor they had not read far enough they didn't find the answer they needed Please help me by making absolutely sure the answer isn't in the walkthroughalready I am a writer
I write in english and I appreciate those that respond to mein english do it correctly
I do not respond to quot internet shorthand quot
Donot write quot r quot instead of quot are quot
Do not write quot quot instead of quot for quot
Do notwrite quot quot instead of quot to quot and for God's sake don't write quot knoe quot instead of quot know quot
I took the time to write using proper english you will take the timeto respond to me in proper english

Stand to the left or back to see the runes
It has the names of the demons and runes associated with that demon below it
Kapjip Naviz has Acra Urak and Culu runes under the etched name
These runes is changed in later game release to Acra Zeph and Inus The small pillar is also the focal point of the stone veins coming from stone spikes
Relic pedestal Behind the pillar are rising steps that goes up to a pedestal
Go up to the pedestal and see that it is the perfect place to put the relic
On the ground at left of path is the stone vein that brings electricity to the pedestal and comes from the rune pillar
Glass globe To the right of the ritual pedestal is another rising steps
It has a glass globe on the top
Stone Spikes There are stone spikes around the area that have cavity on the base where the runes are inserted
Prepare for the ritual Read the Destruction of Kapjip Naviz page in documents
The runes Acra Urak and Culu are in boldface
These boldfaced runes is changed in later game release to Acra Zeph and Inus
First disable the entire chain of the knot otherwise the lightning will strike the pedestal prematurely
Use the pick axe to move the light colored stone vein segment going to the pedestal
Secondly find out which stone spikes are for which runes
Go to the glass globe right of the ritual pedestal
Use the glass globe and see a stone spike with a rune on it
Study the surrounding area so that you can identify it later
Use the D key to scroll to all stone spikes with their runes and learn their surroundings
Then place the correct runes on the correct stone spikes
If the correct rune is placed in its proper stone spikes the rune will light up above the pillar at the edge of the clearing
This verifies then that that is the stone spike for that rune
All runes will light up when the rune tablets are in their own spike
Ritual
Verify that the light colored stone vein going to the relic pedestal is removed

Place selected runes on their proper stone spikes
Note The runes Acra Urak and Culu given as clues above did not produce the solution needed for the correct ending
Place the Acra Zeph and Inus runes in their proper stone spikes Thanks Mordack
Acra spike is situated at bottom right step from the glass globe
The backdrop is a cliff
Zeph spike is situated across the glass globe stairs
The stairs go down and is beside the bridge on the right
Inus spike is situated left of the arch and right of the pedestal close to the clearing
See the runes above the pillar at the clearing

Destination Treasure Island A Walkthrough by ZURREEN ZUBAIRIE Copyright All rights reserved
Please note that this walkthrough is copyrighted Hence anyattempt to reproduceanythingfrom this walkthrough will beseverelypunished to themaximumextent of the law
The Walkthrough GENERALLY This is actually a very easy game and I would encourage you to try to solve as many puzzles as you can on your own For this reason I have tried to write the following walkthrough so that you can find the answer to a question without quot accidentally discovering quot the answer to another that you might have preferred to find yourself
As for the game itself the format is similar to that of quot The Return to Mysterious Island quot and quot Voyage ndash A Journey Beyond Reality quot that is in the way you combine things disassemble them etc There is no quot Intelligence Score quot in this game however something that I had really enjoyed in the above two games But this game has a lot of qualities that more than make up for that shortcoming The storyline is more sophisticated the puzzles are fun and the game overall is quite creative and presents a wonderful adventure
COMBINE Just pick up an item in the inventory place it on another item and click If you need only two items for the combination they will be combined But if you need more items a box will open at the bottom of the screen showing the two items and a question mark for each of the missing items Feel free to try any or every item in your inventory to see if it fits
DISASSEMBLE EMPTY If an item can be disassembled or emptied a black and white spanner symbol will appear in its lower right corner Just place the item on the spanner in the lower left portion of the screen and the item will be disassembled or emptied as the case may be But note do not worry about losing a vessel's contents There are really only two liquids in this game rum and water Of these water is the only thing that is ever lost when you empty the vessel the helmet But that is okay because you can always get more water throughout the game In the case of rum however you do not really quot empty quot the bottle and therefore never lose the rum Putting the bottle on the spanner only opens it by removing the cork which then appears as a separate item in your inventory
THE MAP You can use this map to get from one place to another during the game if you have already visited the second place at least once In order to do this open the map and click on the spot where you would like to go You will see the hero jump from one point in the map to the other and you will then find yourself at that other location
Note I have often given the quot physical quot directions to various places even after we have visited them already just in case you might want to quot go by foot quot again I have also used different labels for some places from those indicated in the map For example I call the place where you first arrive as quot The Point of Arrival quot I thought that it might be better to call it that than quot Cape Fear quot as it is called in the map because my descriptive label might be easier to remember than the map's non descriptive name especially after we are introduced to the quot Flowery Coast quot and have to then differentiate quot Cape Fear quot from the quot Flowery Coast quot both of which happen to be on the same side of the island
THE ALTERNATIVE STORY It might be best to mention the following right here in the introduction At the beginning of the game there is not only aSextantbut also aMarine Chronometer found up on the ceiling in Jim Hawkins' cabin The game will allow you to take either both or even neither of these instruments when you leave for Emerald Island The storyline and thus the game play will be at least slightly affected by your particular choice I have written the following walkthrough assuming that you take only theSextant Unlike some walkthrough writers however I decided not to use boxes etc
to try to show what would happen if we had made another choice because doing so seems to make the walkthrough unnecessarily complicated I chose the Sextant only choice because that was how I first played the game and also because I loved having to repair that dinghy which would not have required any repair if I had taken both the instruments
Feel free to try any or all of the other three possibilities one by one to see how it affects the game Whatever choice you make rest assured that the game will provide you with whatever you might need to finish it Enjoy the quot exploration quot of the other possibilities
Well that is all I can think of in terms of a general guide to the game Following is a more detailed step by step walkthrough Please feel free to address any comments or questions about this walkthrough toZSZUBAIRIE AOL com
Jim Hawkins' cabin After the beginning cutscene you hear a rapping Turn to the middle of the three large windows on your left Open the window Click on the parrot Retrieve theMessagefrom its left claw the one onyourright A cutscene follows Click on the quot X quot in the lower right corner of the screen to close the Map

After the parrot finishes talking moving RIGHT pick up the following objects SEXTANT from the top left of the desk under the small window BLACK SPOT from the top center of the pole left of the door after the cutscene THICK ROPE from the same spot as the Black Spot LIGHTER from the floor on the right of the bed and ROPE from the same spot as the Lighter

You need to keep completing your assignments and perfecting your special ability

Robert rsquo s special ability was to produce apparitions but he became suspicious of DITR rsquo s motivation for perfecting that ability
Another employee seemed to be helping Robert and Henry get to the bottom of things
Pieces of paper were left in the bird house to let them know when certain locations would be unattended
Henry thinks Robert was murdered

Henry wants you to try to find more information about Sydelle

Henry thinks DITR is some kind of government probably military operation
You are to look for yellow dossiers everywhere you go DITR the warehouse and Hungerton rsquo s house
He also thinks the computers would have valuable information but they are password protected

Henry rsquo s special ability is that he can tell when someone is lying

Henry doesn rsquo t like or trust Nadine

Henry thinks that Sydelle rsquo s special ability might be among the most important to what DITR is trying to accomplish

Go back inside the house
As you walk through the living room Sydelle knocks on the door
She is upset because she knows you are up to something and you haven rsquo t shared with her
You tell her everything but she is still skeptical about your arrangement with Henry
She eventually agrees to serve as a distraction at the warehouse
Leave your house and take the right path at the fork to the town square
The warehouse is the building left of the statue and library
Warehouse Enter the warehouse to see Sydelle talking to the warehouse boss
He goes through a ridiculously long accounting of everything stored there
You can left click through much of that dialog
Step forward into the warehouse and when the boss rsquo back is turned continue toward the back
Note There is much to do here and because this is your one chance you cannot leave the warehouse until all the tasks have been performed

Look at it to see that will accommodate three plugs
Continue back into the warehouse and see an office with an open door
You can try to enter but there is someone in there
Continue all the way to the back of the warehouse where you see vehicles of all kinds
Look at the fire detectors on the ceiling This gives you an idea
There is a reddish crate down the left side of the aisle
Try to set the crate on fire with your matches but the crate is too damp
Pour your lighter fluid on the crate and then try your matches again
You realize that this would set off the sprinklers and damage the files in the office
Look at the ldquo board rdquo on the right wall and use it to get a closeup
Click the water switches on the right side of the board to turn off the water but leave everything else alone
Now go back to the crate and try your matches again
The fire signal goes off but not the sprinklers
Come back down screen and enter the now empty office
Next to the door is a printer atop a stand with three drawers
Open each drawer and look at it to see whether there is anything inside

Look at the desk and see two yellow dossiers
There are two more on the shelf right of the computer
For each of these folders open and read then use your cell phone to photograph the contents
Note that Henry rsquo s and Nadine rsquo s dossiers are included here
Now you are done in the warehouse so leave the office and the building and go to the apartment building
Apartment Building Go up to the third floor and knock on the door across from the stairs
This is where Jerry said his parents live
You get no answer so try the master key on the door
However you reconsider and decide to talk to Nadine first
Go down to the second floor and knock on Nadine rsquo s door
Having read her file you know that Nadine rsquo s special ability is in controlling animals
You confront Nadine with her being the one who has been sending messages via the bird
Nadine hasn rsquo t wanted to become more involved than that because she doesn rsquo t want to lose her job
You continue your web cam narration
You are obviously getting in bad shape and you now regret being so suspicious of the goings on at DITR
Mr Hungerton rsquo s House You automatically meet with Hungerton at his house and confess that you have been snooping
He knows what you have been doing and doesn rsquo t seem to care
You end up outside his house
Go back to the apartment building Apartment Building Go up to the third floor to the apartment that Jerry said his parents live in
Use your master key on the door across from the stairs
You see that the apartment has not been inhabited for a long time and you wonder why Jerry lied to you
Leave the apartment building and head for the DITR building
DITR Building Enter the building and go up to the meeting room first door on the right

Now turn on the projector to get that hypnotic image on the screen
Use your cell phone on the screen to shoot a short video of it
Click the bookKing Mouseon yourself and see again the blank red pages
Click your cell phone on the pages
After several clicks including the activation of the red filter you see the two pages filled with codes
Based on conversations with Nadine and others you can assume that these are passwords or clues to passwords
Note Exiting the book will not lose the text
Now repeat that same procedure for the other three books
Leave the building and go to the apartment building
Apartment Building Go to Henry rsquo s apartment on the second floor knock and use your master key to enter
Go into Henry rsquo s bedroom on the right and see the bulletin board with notes
Keep looking until you see a note about someone banging on his door and he won rsquo t go down without a fight
Go back to the main room and then into the bathroom on the left
Observe the blood on the floor
Leave the apartment and the apartment building and go back to the DITR building
DITR Building Go upstairs and see that the door at the end of the hall is now open
Go into the examination room and look to see who the two people are
Coming out of the right wall is a thick cable that is connected to a big machine in the back
Use your scissors to cut the cable
Leave the examination room and go into Dr Brown rsquo s office
There is a yellow dossier on the shelf along the right wall
Take and read Sydelle rsquo s startling dossier
Note that she has a rating and that she has ldquo targeted rdquo individuals
While Dr Brown is busy in the examination room this is your opportunity to access his computer
Before you do it will be helpful to try to complete the table of books that was started earlier DITR Employee Alias Title Author Robert E Lee Rocketfall Jim Axleton Dr Brown James Longstreet Without Guilt Thomas Clumsy Jennie Hodges King Mouse Jimmy Clavellmore Frances Clalin Black Mansion Stephanie Queen Recall that you foundRocketfallon Hungerton rsquo s patio table so that association seems plausible
Also by using your special abilities you came up with the password for the receptionist rsquo s computer ma ne er
Look through the four books to see whether any of the listed codes come close to that
The only you can find is ma ne er inKing Mouse
Therefore it seems reasonable to associateKing Mousewith the receptionist
Note too that the ma ne er code is for week all times
By elimination that leavesBlack Mansionfor the librarian
The completed table is DITR Employee Alias Title Author Mr Hungerton Robert E Lee Rocketfall Jim Axleton Dr Brown James Longstreet Without Guilt Thomas Clumsy Receptionist Jennie Hodges King Mouse Jimmy Clavellmore Librarian Frances Clalin Black Mansion Stephanie Queen In the case of Dr Brown his code should be found inWithout Guilt
Look again in that book and see that two other items of information are needed to identify the code the week and the time
You already know that this is week from the receptionist rsquo s bookKing Mouse
As always you can determine the time by using the eye cursor on yourself
Note The time will vary depending on where you are in the game but the procedure is the same in all cases
Look at Dr Brown rsquo s bookWithout Guiltand go to the section for week
You see the following p p hjre nb wetmrt mxxx mbitrlsore nbnbvrr knmoer From Robert rsquo s diary we know that the passwords are ldquo dynamic rdquo and that the codes in these books will not work
What adjustment needs to be made
The answer lies in comparing the receptionist rsquo s book code with the correct password Book code ma ne er Password ma ne er Note that the letters do not change only the numbers and the numbers add up to
Thus to convert a book code to the actual password keep the letters and subtract the book code numbers from to obtain the password numbers
Thus Dr Brown rsquo s password can be found in the following table depending on the time of your game Time Book Code Password p p hjre nb p p hjre nb wetmrt mxxx wetmrt mxxx mbitrlsore mbitrlsore nbnbvrr knmoer nbnbvrr knmoer Enter the correct password to access Dr Brown rsquo s computer
Select ldquo Network rdquo to see two folders Click the Hungerton folder and then ldquo Finances mrt rdquo to see his financial report
Back out of ldquo Network rdquo and look at the two folders at the bottom right corner
Click ldquo Conference mrt rdquo to read the report about the yellow phosphorus you have ingested
Click ldquo To Print mrt rdquo and read ldquo Additions to Simon Davenport rsquo s report rdquo Simon can visit other peoples rsquo dreams and take someone else to those dreams
This sounds like a visit with Simon would be in order
Leave the DITR building and go to the apartment building
Apartment Building Go up to the third floor and knock on the door that is at the back right
You tell Simon that you want him to visit a dream Sydelle rsquo s and to take you with him
He can rsquo t do that without an authorization from Dr Brown
Try to talk to him again and he goes back inside
And now for a little trickery
Use your pen on the blank letterhead paper
Knock on the door again and give the bogus letter to Simon
However he still not satisfied
After he goes back inside his apartment use the stamp on the ink pad and then use the inked stamp on the bogus letter
Knock on the door once again and present the stamped letter to Simon
Now he is okay with it but to enter Sydelle rsquo s dream he needs something personal that belongs to her Go downstairs to Sydelle rsquo s apartment knock and let yourself in with the master key
Go to her bedroom and pick up thepink blouse
Go back upstairs knock on Simon rsquo s door and give the pink blouse to him
Simon transports you to Sydelle rsquo s dream

Once you have looked at everything you are back outside Simon rsquo s door again
Leave the building and go back to the DITR building
DITR Building Go up the stairs and enter Hungerton rsquo s office
See the yellow dossier in the cabinet to the right
Read your dossier
Note the recommendation that Henry rsquo s contract be terminated
Try to get into Hungerton rsquo s computer
The method is exactly the same as it was for Dr Brown
Check the time by using the eye cursor on yourself
Hungerton rsquo s book isRocketfall
Use that book on yourself and turn to page
Look at the codes for week choose the book code for your time of day and convert the code to the correct password as before
Time Book Code Password yui fakhh yui fakhh nnn klgj b nnn klgj b nert dz ubvmc nert dz ubvmc ujb mpec ujb mpec Look at the ldquo unlock rdquo icon in the lower right corner
According to Robert rsquo s diary this unlocks the door to the basement
Use the icon and hope it works
Leave the office and go down the stairs
You see that the door at the foot of the stairs is now open
Go through the door to the basement
Enter the first door on the back wall
You see a guard and a huge bank of monitors that are not working because of your sabotage with the cable upstairs
Look at the gun next to the guard
You can try to grab it but that rsquo s not a good idea
Leave the room and enter the next door on the back wall
This is a lab of some kind or maybe a morgue
Look at the sheet and lift it to find Henry
Look at him
Look at the bottle on the shelf on the back wall
It is yellow phosphorus
Take thevial
Leave the room and look at the gray metal door along the left wall
Go into what looks like a dungeon cell
A prisoner is chained to the wall
It rsquo s Robert
Robert talks to you and wants to be set free
Look around and then talk to him again
You suggest the plan of Robert rsquo s sending an apparition to distract the guard but he isn rsquo t up to it Click every one of your thoughts on Robert to learn more about DITR
Use your cell phone with Robert to hypnotize him
If this does not eventually have the desired effect leave the cell and then return
When you are told that it is okay to do so leave the cell
Go to the first room with the monitors
Now that the guard is no longer there take the gun
Leave the monitor room and sit back for a very long ending

DISCWORLD Solution by Phil Darke The humour and distinctive style of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series of books and the original Discworld computer game
Have made them probably the funniest and best available
Discworld continues this tradition
However it should be appreciated that much of the humour is impromptu and not necessarily important to solving the puzzles in the game
It is with this in mind that I suggest that while are playing this game you should visit every available location talk to all the characters and try any actions that occur to you even if they do not seem to be logical
When Rincewind encounters something which is relevant you will receive a fairly obvious hint that there is something to be done here
Although this will not usually tell you exactly what is required it certainly helps to put you on the right track
So although this solution will give all the answers to all of the problems I suggest that you only resort to it if you are stuck and hopefully this will enable you to not only complete the game but also appreciate the humour within the game but enough waffle from me on with the game
Watch the intro at least once It does not tell you much about the game but it is excellent
DEATH seems to have gone AWOL leaving the souls of the departed with nowhere to go
In order to rectify this situation the Arch chancellor of Unseen University has declared that it will be necessary to perform the Rites Of Ashkent
This requires that a number of ingredients be collected in order to perform the aforesaid Rites and this is where Rincewind comes in
You start in the University Dining Hall with the Luggage and a list of ingredients
These are Glitter Dust Three pieces of wood all exactly the same length ccs of mouse blood Dribbly candles and a vile smell
GLITTER DUST Go to the Plaza and have a chat to the Milk maid who is doing a Marylyn Monroe impersonation outside the Odium
Take a good look at the dress it is covered in sequins just what you need
Take a closer look at her impersonation and you may notice that something is not quite right maybe a bit of a draught from the grating she is standing on would do the trick
Next go to the University's High Energy Facility
After a bit of a chat and a good look round grab the bellows and head for the ruins of the Fools Guild
Go down the hole and into the sewers
Search around and you will find yourself under the grate on which the Milk maid is standing
Use the bellows on the grate and youwill be showered with sequins
Bingo
back to the university and hand them over to the Archchancellor
THREE PIECES OF WOOD Go to the garden and take a look at the croquet mallets which the Dean the Bursar and the Librarian are using
The handles of those mallets would be just perfect
Of course their present owners are not willing to part with them so you need to find something to put in their place
The first of these is easy to find
Just go to the wandering shop and after a chat with the owner take the stuffed Flamingo
Also take the stuffed Fish
Now go to the docks
There is a bird sitting on the roof who would make a good mallet substitute and also hanging up in the net is a Hammerhead Shark who would do very nicely
Throw the stuffed fish into the water
The Bird will dive down tograb it and knock its self out so pick it up
The net however is not going to give up the shark so easily and you need something to cut the net
Go to Shades and find the entrance to the mortuary
Inside is a slops trough examine it and take the knife
So back to the docks and use the knife on the net and pick up the Shark
Now head to the University Garden and swap the Shark for the Bursar's mallet the Flamingo for the Dean's mallet and the Bird with the Librarian
Take the mallets to the Archchancellor
FOUR ccs OF MOUSE BLOOD The first thing to do is to find a mouse
Fortunately Gimlets near the Shades specialises in such delicacies
Go to Gimlets and sit at the table
Examine the menu and then talk to Gimlet
Order one extra rare mouse burger
Now you need a means to extract the blood
Now go to the Trolls Head in Shades
Here you find a Vampire
Talk to him and you will discover that he has false teeth
If you visited the cemetery you should have seen a crypt with a coffin and a glass of water nearby
This is where he keeps his teeth when he is sleeping during the day
Rincewind has not got time to wait for dawn so he needs something to persuade him that it is time for bed
How about a cock crow
Did you notice a cock in the University Garden
that would do fine
However it will not cooperate
Maybe you could drug it with something
Cocks are very partial to corn
Go to the Plaza and buy some pop corn from Dibbler
Now you need something with which to drug the corn
Some alcohol would do so go to the Trolls Head and buy a drink
While you are here talk to Casanunda
He has a ladder which you will need later
Ask him for the ladder
He tells you that he will give you the ladder in exchange for an introduction to a lady who is close enough to the ground for him to serenade without the use of the ladder
While you where in the mortuary earlier you should have seen a coffin containing the mortal remains of Granny Weatherwax
Tell Casanunda about her
He will now give you the ladder
Return to the University garden
Use the drink on the corn then give the corn to the rooster
You now have the rooster
Return to Shades
Unfortunately the alcohol has worked so well that the rooster is incapable of crowing so you need to sober him up
Go and look for the beggars in Shades
Here you will find a can containing coffee
Take the can and use it on the Rooster
Now return to the Trolls Head and use the Rooster on the vampire
On hearing the crowing he decides that it is time for bed and heads off to his coffin dropping his teeth into the glass before settling down to sleep
Follow him and use the ladder on the coffin and take the teeth
Use the teeth on the mouse to get the blood
However you still need some way to measure ccs
While in the High Energy facility earlier you may have seen a test tube
Go there and take the tube
In the process of removing it you break the machine and release the ants but more of this later
Use the test tube on the teeth and go and give it to the Archchancellor
DRIBBLY CANDLES While you where in the wandering shop you may have noticed some candles
If you ask the old woman about these she tells you that they are for show only
However she will make some candles for you if you get her some bees wax
There are some bee hives in the University garden
Go there and talk to the bee keeper
He is obsessed with bees and the Queen in particular and wants to spread his knowledge
When you spoke to Dibbler earlier in the game he may have given you a leaflet about clickies
This is just what the bee keeper needs so give him the leaflet and away he goes
You are now free to get the bees wax from the hive
First however you need some protection and something with which to smoke the bees from the hive
Go to Shades and into Mrs Cake's shop at the left is a mannequin wearing a petticoat
Try to take the petticoat and you get a piece of material which will make a perfect veil
Now for the smoke
In the wandering shop are some incense sticks so go and get them
On the counter of the Trolls Head is a box of matches so get these as well and return to the bee hives
Wear the veil and use the matches to light the incense sticks
Use the lighted incense sticks on the hive and get some wax
Go and give the wax to the old woman in the wandering shop and she will make some candles for you
However these candles are not very dribbly
The old woman tells you that you need to make the bees drink a lot of water
To do this you need to go back to Gimlets and get the Chilli powder from the table
The bees will not take the chilli powder if you use it on them
So use it on the flowers
Using the same procedure as before collect some more wax which is now very dribbly
So off to the shop and get the old woman to make you some more candles
these are just right so go and give them to the Archchancellor
A VILE SMELL Go to Shades where the beggars are
Here you will notice a vile smell
However you can not just take it
You need a suitable container first
The ideal container is the genie bottle in Mrs Cake's shop
Before you shoot off there to get it have a chat with Foul Ole Ron
Ask him about the vile smell and he tells you that it likes boots
Now off to Mrs Cake's shop
Your first problem here is one of communication
Mrs Cake has the power of pre cognition
This means that she will answer your questions before you ask them
So in order to be able to understand her you need to talk to her in the reverse order to what you would normally
Before you start talking to her look at the genie bottle
Now talk to Mrs Cake clicking on the icons in the following order sarcasm question muse and greeting
Ask her about the genie bottle and she will agree to give it to you in exchange for some ectoplasm
If you question her further about ectoplasm she tells you that it can be wrung out of ghosts
There just happen to be a couple of ghosts conveniently located at the ruins of the Fools Guild but they are not willing to come with you as they have to haunt the Fools Guild
Look around and you will find a brick lying on the ground
Use the brick on the ghosts and convince them that since this is part of the Fools Guild they could haunt the brick instead
You now need to find a way to wring the ectoplasm from the ghosts
If you have been paying attention you will have noticed a centrifuge in the University's High Energy Facility perfect
Go there and use the brick on the centrifuge to obtain some ectoplasm
While you are here pick up the magnet as you will shortly be needing this
Go to Mrs Cake's shop and give her the ectoplasm in exchange for the genie bottle
Now go to the university garden
On the right of the screen near the compost heap you find an Imp
Talk to him and ask about his boots
These boots have steel toe caps so use the magnet on the imp and voila one fine pair of daisy roots
Now go back to Shades and use the boots on the genie bottle then use the bottle on the vile smell which then takes up residence in the bottle
Now go back to the university and give the vile smell to the Archchancellor
The rite of Ashkente is duly performed and DEATH appears but it seems that he is enjoying himself too much to come back and perform his duties
Our hero Rincewind is given the task of finding out where he has gone and bringing him back
ACT TWO It appears that DEATH has decided to take a holiday in the land of XXXX and you need to find some transport to get there
If you go to the docks you will find a ship moored there
Talk to the captain and ask him for passage to XXXX
He tells you that he is booked up to take the undead and since you are clearly alive there is no place for you
Go to Shades and talk to the dead collector
He tells you that you need a death certificate
Go to the mortuary and talk to the mortician
Ask about a death certificate and he tells you that he has to perform two tests before he can issue you with a death certificate
The first test is if you do not cloud a cold mirror and the second is to testyour pulse
You need to get a false arm
The dummy in Mrs Cakes shop would be perfect but you can not break the arm off
Go to where the beggars are and take the saw
Return to Mrs Cake's and use the saw on the dummy
Return to the mortuary
Your breath would obviously cloud the cold mirror
So you need to warm it up pick up the mirror and use it on the Bunsen burner
Put the mirror back on the bench and hop onto the slab
Use the wooden arm on Rincewind and talk to the mortician
Great you passed the tests
Unfortunately he forgot to tell you about the final test
To check body temperature
The size of the thermometer and its intended target give Rincewind a shock and he fails the body temperature test
Something is clearly need to reduce Rincewind's temperature
Some ice would be just the job
Go to the sewers where you got the glitter dust
Nearby is a ladder leading up to the Pork Futures warehouse
You can not just pick up the ice though you need something to break a chunk of it off
Go to the cemetery and take the pickaxe and use it to get some ice
Now return to the mortuary and repeat the previous procedure but this time use the ice on Rincewind
You get your death certificate
Show it to the dead collector and it's hi ho of to XXXX
When you get there death is lounging around on Bonedie beach
Have a chat with him and he finally agrees to come back but only if you can make him more popular
How about a clickie with him in the starring role
Who do you know who does clickies Dibbler of course
So it's off back to Ank Morpork and talk to him
He agrees but requires three things Some novelties a gorgeous babe and a catchy jingle with a band to sing it
NOVELTIES There is a novelty shop on the docks in Ank Morpork but since Rincewind has no way of getting in there he is going to have to break down the wall
Head for Holy wood
Here you will find a ton weight
Take it and return to the docks
Use the weight on the hook which held the net
Swing the weight against the wall
It is not heavy enough to break the wall so you need to find a way to make it heavier
Go back to Holywood
Look at the mail box near where you got the weight
It has a label with on it take the label and go and stick it onto the weight and try again
This time the wall is demolished
Pick up the novelties and head back to Holywood and give them to Dibbler
A GORGEOUS BABE
The obvious candidate for this is the milk maid who has now taken up residence in the trailer near where Dibbler is
Look at the door it is locked
The Troll security guard has the key
Talk to him and persuade him to give it to you
Open the trailer door and go and talk to the milk maid
She will help you but only if you find her a little friend by which she means a diamond
In the course of your conversation with the troll you should have discovered that trolls teeth are made of diamond
Earlier in the game when you spoke to Gimlet you should have discovered that trolls are very partial to Rock candy but he has run out
The source of rock candy is Djelibeybi
So head off there
Look at the rock candy and talk to the rock seller
Just as you are about to clinch the deal a bunch of women appear and grab it
It seems that this is used as ammunition for stonings but there is not one scheduled for a couple of months
Rincewind is going to have to arrange a stoning since he can't wait that long
Remember the suffrajester back in Ank Morpork
She would be ideal
First go to the stoning area which is to the left of the rock seller and take the stake
Go back to Ank Morpork
The suffrajester has tied herself to the dovecote in the university gardens
Talk to her and then use the stake on the compost heap
The suffrajester will tie herself to the stake and Rincewind can grab the stake with her attached and head back to Djelibeybi
Go to the stoning area and use the stake on the hole
After the stoning take the rock candy and the rope and head back to Holywood
Give the rock candy to the troll and when he complains of toothache use the rope on him
Take the diamond and give it to the milk maid
Pick up the milk maid and give her to Dibbler
A CATCHY JINGLE Go to Djelibeybi and talk to Uri Djeller
He tells you about a philosopher in the desert
You can not get there on foot so hire a camel and head off into the desert
Go to the cartwheel and talk to the philosopher
He writes a jingle for you but before he will give it to you you must find the answer to the eternal question WHY
The computer in Unseen University rsquo s High Energy Facility could supply the answer
Go and talk to Skazz
Since your last visit the machine does not work due to a shortage of ants
So off you go to get some
There is an anthill near Bonedie beach but of course you can't just pick them up
You need some bait
A hamper full of food would do
Go and talk to Dibbjla in his shop
He will give you a boomerang
Look at the baskets in his shop and buy a basket
An empty basket is no use of course so you need to fill it
Go to the dining hall in the University and use the basket on the anthill
Go back to the High Level Energy Facility and use the basket on the machine
You didn't think it would be that easy did you
The little buggers are quite happy where they are and show no inclination to get into the machine
You need something to tempt them something sweet
How about some honey
First you need a container
Go to Shades
Near the Beggars there is a pot go and get it then go to the bee hives
Use the same procedure as you did to get the wax but use the pot on the hives
Now go back to the High Level Energy Facility and use the pot on the hamper
Hooray success the ants are now in the machine and you can ask your question WHY
Skazz tells you that it will take a little time about two million years
Back in Djelibeybi there is a man who builds pyramids which slow down time
Maybe he could build one to accelerate time
So head off there but first pick up the hoops from the croquet lawn
When you get back to Djelybebi talk to the architect and take the plans from the wall
Now go to the square and talk to Uri Djeller
Give him the croquet hoops and he will straighten them for you
Now go back to the High Level Energy Facility and use the plans on the wires to construct a pyramid
Use the pyramid on the machine and then talk to Skazz
Finally you get the answer BECAUSE
OK head back off to the Philosopher and give him the answer and he will give you the jingle
Go and give it to Dibbler
You still need a band to perform the jingle
Go to the hill near Djelybebi and talk to Bone Idle
He agrees to perform
Use the knife to cut him down and go and give the band to Dibbler
Great you got everything now you can start shooting but where is the star DEATH
Still in make up
DEATH is being awkward and nothing the make up girl does is right
She refuses to do any more unless you bring her a picture of the elven queen
To do this you are going to need a camera and an imp
Go to where the trainer is
There is a camera here so take it
You also need an imp to take the picture
Ask the trainer about imps
he tells you to take the one on the water cooler
The imp runs off as soon as you try to grab him
Use the boomerang with the paint
Then use it on the imp
Use the imp on the camera
So off to find the Elven Queen
The only person who can tell you where to find her is Granny Weatherwax
So go to the mortuary in Ank Morpork and talk to her
She is being pestered by Casanunda thanks to your efforts earlier in the game
Granny Weatherwax will only help you if you get rid of him
Talk to Casanunsda and tell him about the women in Djelybebi and he will be off
Now ask Granny Weatherwax about the Elven Queen
She shows you where the elven lands are situated
Go there and double click on the stones Rincewind can get in but the luggage can not follow
Go to the castle and you are chased away by the guards
The guards mention that the Queen's pet is missing
Go and ask Granny Weatherwax about the pet
She tells you that it is a Unicorn
In the wardrobe department in Holywood there is a pantomime horse costume
The wardrobe lady will give it to you in exchange for some costume jewellery
At the Oasis near Djelybebi there is a mummified arm with a ring on it
It is guarded by a pair of Vultures
They will not part with it so you need something to swap it for
The wooden arm would do but first you need to wrap it in some cloth
Go to Mrs Cake's shop and take the scissors
Now where do you think you could find bandages
In a pyramid of course
Go to the Pyramid near Djelybebi and use the scissors on the mummy inside the tomb
While you are here take the embalmers glue you will need this later
Use the bandages on the wooden arm and return to the Oasis
Swap the wooden arm for the rotten arm
Go back to the wardrobe lady
Take the ring from the arm and give it to her
She will now give you the horse costume
To make it into a Unicorn you need a horn for it
Near the fools guild there is a hooter go and get it
Now go to the dining room in the University
Talk to the librarian and ask him to partner you in the Unicorn suit
Use the suit on the Librarian he takes the front end
Use the glue on the hooter then use the hooter on the suit
Go back to the Elven lands but before entering transfer the purse from Rincewind's personal inventory to the luggage and the camera and the horse costume to the luggage's inventory
Enter the stone circle then use the horse costume on Rincewind
Enter the castle and use the camera on the Elven Queen
Get out of there and go back to Holywood
Give the picture of the Elven Queen to the make up artist
Ok everything is finally set to start shooting the film
Talk to Dibbler and the filming starts
After the first few scenes DEATH objects to having to perform his own stunts and demands that you provide him with a stunt double
STUNT DOUBLE Go to Ank Morpork and go to the Fresh Start Club which is in Shades opposite Mrs Cake's shop
Knock on the door at first you can not get in
Show the death certificate to Reg Shoe and he will let you in
Once inside open the closet
Inside is the Black Sheep's skeleton
Talk to him and ask him to be DEATH's double
He agrees but the actor's union will not allow him to perform unless he can provide proof of his ancestry
This can be found in a cave near Bonedie beach
The only way to get to the cave is to surf the waves
Go to Mrs Cake's shop and open the closet
Take the ironing board and use the saw on it to remove the legs
Go to Bonedie beach and use the board on the surf
At first Rincewind keeps falling off so use the glue on the board
Rincewind will now end up in the cave
Look at the paintings and use the camera on them
Show the pictures of the cave paintings to the sheep
Finally the film is made
Rincewind now appears at the premiere of DEATH's clickie
The audience hates it
In the projection room Rincewind must sort it out
Take the reel of film off the projector and use it on the editing table
Splice in the left over footage of the Elven Queen and run the film again
This time it is a success
The success of his film has gone to DEATH' head and he is hailed as a cult idol
He is now unwilling to return to his old job so poor old Rincewind is lumbered and must take on the job
ACT THREE THE GRIM RINCEWIND Binky DEATH's horse whisks you away to his house
Enter the house and go to the kitchen
Here you meet Albert the butler
He tells you that before you can take on the job
You will need to demonstrate your ability to ride Binky and a black robe a deep booming voice and a scythe
On the table is a sugar bowl
If Rincewind could take them and give them to Binky that would surely do the trick
Albert however is not willing to part with them
Leave the kitchen and go up the stairs
Enter DEATH's study and pull the cord
Albert leaves the kitchen to investigate giving you just enough time to nip into the kitchen and grab the sugar
Go to the stable and give the sugar to Binky
Pick up the saddle and use it on Binky
Try to ride the horse
Albert gives Binky a slap making him rear up and throw Rincewind
Use the glue on the saddle and try again
This time Albert is convinced
Now you need to find a black robe
Go back to the house and take the curtains from the hallway
Show this to Albert
He says that it is not black enough
Go back to the study and take the inkwell
Go to the garden to the right of the stable and use the ink on the fishpond
Use the curtain on the pond then go and show it to Albert
He grudgingly agrees that it will do
Now for the voice
Take the rope from the stable and tie it to the boomerang
Go back to the house and throw the boomerang at the chimney
Climb up and shout down the chimney
Albert is a bit hard of hearing and can not hear you properly
go back to the kitchen and open the pot belly stove
Now go back to the chimney and try again
Success
The final part is to get a scythe
There is one in the umbrella stand by the front door
Take it and show it to Albert
He says that you must demonstrate that you can use it by reaping the corn in the field
Go to the field and use the scythe on the corn
Unfortunately Rincewind's efforts are pretty pathetic
If only he had something to use it with to make it more efficient
In the garden is a toy cart
This belongs to Susan DEATH's grand daughter
Talk to her and she agrees to give you it in exchange for one of the biographies from the library specifically Rincewind's biography
Go to the library and take it to her
However she has now changed her mind and wants a book with pictures
These books are hidden away in a locked alcove in the library
Go to the house and pick up the door mat
Underneath is a key
Take the key and go to the library On the far right hand side is the alcove
Unlock it and enter
It is pitch black in here and Rincewind can not see a thing
What is obviously needed is a candle
From his experience earlier in the game Rincewind knows how to make candles
All he needs is the raw materials
There are bee hives in the garden but before he can get it he needs a veil some smoke and string for the wick

Maze Father Arno falls down a trap door
Clue Read the inscription on the floor It is not suitable that the sequence of the immortals grow infinitely
Of those who come few will be chosen The immortals want that their number be limited and the rest be their victims
This inscription is also a clue
Since the immortals wants limited immortal servants it follows that numbers should decrease not increase
We already saw a mathematical progression on the entrance number lock
So the clue to the maze is a sequential decrease in number
Take note of the Roman Numerals above each spiked gate
If we continue the entrance number lock progression we will reach up to the number of the only spiked gate open MDXCVII
Going in reverse from the calculated sequence enter the spiked gate that has these numbers Forward to MDXCVII There's an odor of tobacco
Right to CMLXXXVII Left to DCX Forward to CCCLXXVII Forward to CCXXXIII Forward to CXLIV Forward to LXXXIX Smells like tobacco Horizont brand
Look at the floor and see fresh blood
Right to LV Strange odor much stronger than tobacco
Right to XXXIV Fresh blood on floor
Advance in spite of risk
Left to XXI Forward to XIII Forward to VIII Left to V Right to III Left to II Right to I Forward to I Forward to blank
Before the Per Aspera gate Father Arno falls down again through another trap door
Meet Janos
Mythical Beasts Duel Talk to Janos and learn about his involvement
He says that he did not kill the Irina or Stephan
Is his pants on fire
He also says that Maria is a servant of Dracula
See that there is a panel with mythical beasts Water serpent basilisk griffon hydra heads and Cerberus heads
The object of the puzzle is to select a beast and Janos selects his beast
If a player's beast wins the partition that separates the men moves towards the loser
The partition pushes the loser closer to the back wall
After wins the back wall of the loser shoots out spikes
The fifth win kills the loser
Clue Take note of the panel and the lines that joins the beasts
There are arrows on those lines that point to the beasts that can be defeated by that beast
The water serpent at top left defeats points to basilisk at top right cereberus at bottom left and griffon at bottom right
The basilisk at top right defeats the griffon at bottom right and the hydra at bottom
The griffon at bottom right defeats the hydra at bottom
The hydra at bottom defeats water serpent at top left and cereberus at bottom left
The cereberus at bottom left defeats the griffon at bottom right and the basilisk at top right
Knowing the strength of the beasts will aid in the selection of your beast to fight the next opponent
The water serpent at top left is the strongest since it wins against opponents but can be defeated by the hydra
The weakest is the griffon but can defeat the hydra
Play Select a beast by pressing an icon
Janos will select his beast without knowing what you selected
Look up and see the selected beast and who won on that round
The defeated one falls down
Result After wins of Father Arno his conscience would not allow for murder by winning the fifth and final round
Janos does not have the same compunction but will kill Arno on the fifth round
My solution which may be different from yours is and then or and then
Escape Duel room If Arno wins times and has moved the partition to push Janos a panel at left side is exposed
Spike cable Use the monkey wrench to open the panel at left wall
See the wire held by metal link that springs the spikes
The link cannot be cut but is screwed in to the wire
Insert the knife inside the link
Turn the link to the left until the knife is at the back
Take the knife and repeat until the link is unscrewed from the holder
This stops the spikes from springing shooting out
Take thesteel wirethat held the link
Play the game one more time to win and move the partition
This exposes the exit door completely
Exit the duel room

Professor Van Helsing's Study Listen as Professor Van Helsing talks about the various ways to defeat vampires
He mentions some untested techniques such as garlic mirrors running water and silver bullets
However the three methods he trusts most are a crucifix holy water and a wooden stake
Your lodger Maria arrives and delivers a letter and a newspaper
The letter is from your former student Jonathan Harker who was on a mission to seek out and destroy Dracula
Right click and look in the Documents to read the letter
Pretending to be a librarian in order to get access to Dracula Harker made the mistake of mentioning his beloved Mina and showing her picture to Dracula
This sent Dracula off to London in search of Mina but not before Harker met his end at Dracula rsquo s hands
Right click again to read the newspaper
In this and in ensuing newspaper articles the most information to gather is a where the murder took place and b the direction in which the perpetrator in one guise or another fled
News Times Crime location Melford home on New Kent Road Flight direction National Gallery Note that the newspaper refers to another similar incident reported in the Tuesday edition
You decide that Mina must be warned and you go there automatically
Mina rsquo s Apartment You decide not to tell Mina about Harker especially because she is so upset over the news about the murder of her servant's sister
After Mina leaves the room pick up the newspaper from the stuffed chair and read the report
Courier Crime location Southwark Bridge Flight direction Tate Art Gallery Pick up the single newspaper from the table next to the door
Daily Big Mirror Crime location intersection of Tottenham Court and Euston Road Flight direction St George rsquo s Cathedral Finally pick up the pile of newspapers at the end of the table
Recall that today's News Times the newspaper brought to you in your study referred to an article two days ago i e
Find that newspaper
News Times Crime location St George rsquo s Church Flight direction Victoria Station Look at Jonathan Harker's picture on the left end of the table
Come down screen and open the curtain to see a map of London
The objective is to use the four newspaper articles above to draw lines from the crime locations to the places to which the aggressor fled

Pick up the red pencil and click it on the crime location circle with the correct label
You hear a confirmation that you are starting at the right place

Drag the pencil to the circle that indicates where the aggressor fled
Release your mouse and you again hear a confirmation
If you make a mistake you can use the eraser at the bottom of the screen to remove individual lines
The flight lines appear to intersect at Godalming Manor so click that spot
This must be the refuge of the criminal and you decide to go there right away
Mina returns to the room and you instruct her to take some precautions
Your assurances ring a little hollow when you promise to dine with her later if you are still alive
Bloomsbury Cemetery Knock on the door of Godalming Manor and a thuggish guy named Hendrick comes out
You tell him a nutty story about being interested in buying the house but it doesn rsquo t work
Note Hendrick rsquo s comment about eating flies
You need to find some other way to get into the manor
Go through the gate on the left to enter the cemetery
Look at the urn with the swarm of flies
Try the tool shed but it is locked
Take the path that leads up screen and see Paul Long digging a grave with his hands
Look at the empty wine bottles on the coffin and take thescraperon the ground in front of Paul
Talk to the grave digger
You suggest that he use a shovel but it is in the locked tool shed and he can rsquo t remember the combination
Paul does recall his boss telling him that the combination can be obtained from the ages of J
B
Lemon and his wife
They are in the mausoleum near the north stairs
He also says that the numbers must be flipped upside down
Continue up the path and around at the first right
The mausoleum you are looking forward is beside the stairs leading down
Note Because these are the north stairs the entry gate to the cemetery is on the south side
This will be helpful to remember in later directions
Look at the engraved plaques on the side of the mausoleum
Hold and drag the scraper around the plaques to clean them up
Keep doing this until you say ldquo Perfect rdquo and the dates are entered in the documents
Return to the tool shed either by walking around the outside or by cutting through the lower section
Look at the lock on the door and see that it is a digit combination lock
Refer to the dates in the documents to see that J
B
Lemon died at age and Suzy Lemon died at age
Therefore the combination should be but the numbers must be flipped upside down
Set on the lock and then push the yellow button at the right
Enter the tool shed and look all around
Take thespadeand theiron barbeside the door and thelanternfrom the table
Go back to Paul Long the gravedigger and talk to him Godalming Manor
The former watchman made all the statues and said that there is a tunnel between the cemetery and manor
Unfortunately the old watchman is dead
He is buried in the lower section a mausoleum with two monks beside a rusty gate
There is a book inside that mentions something about the tunnel passage but Paul has no idea how to get in
Go back to the north side of the cemetery and then down the stairs
Find the old watchman's mausoleum and look at the two monks and the rusted gate
There is a stone inscription on the ground inside the gate but it is too dark to read
The inscription might offer a clue for entering the mausoleum
Use the iron bar on the rusty gate to create an opening
In inventory drag the matches to the lantern to light it
You can try the lantern on the opening in the gate but you need something to get the lantern farther inside
In inventory drag the lantern to the shovel to create a sconce
Now use the sconce on the opening to view the inscription
When you look at the inscription the poem is copied into the documents
It refers to the ldquo celestial henchmen rdquo which means the statues of angels that you might have seen as you walked around the cemetery
There are four angel statues and they can be worked in any order
Angel near the old watchman rsquo s mausoleum Staying at the lower level go up screen to the angel you can see in the background
Look at the angel and see a saint lying horizontally and surrounded by demons and the faithful
Look at the bottom of the engraving and read the inscription When the saint sacrifices himself to redeem our sins the demons drink his blood and the pure cry on him
The squares in front of the surrounding figures can be toggled between a cup for drinking blood and water drops tears
The objective is to set cups for the demons and tears for the faithful
Number the figures through starting at the lower left and working clockwise
Set cups for and
Set tears for all the others
Now press the saint at the upper left corner of the screen and hear the sound of a mechanism
You say ldquo Perfect rdquo Angel at the northwest corner Go up the stairs on your right and then come down screen to an angel that is bent over
When you look at the engraving the text is copied into your documents
The left pan of the scale holds seven sinners and on the right there are weights to be selected to bring the scale into balance
The weights can be determined from the judgments in the text
Sin Weight wrath for each of the three wrathful sinners conceit times what a wrathful sinner got envy Half the total for wrath and conceit of gluttony Half the total for wrath and conceit of miser Twice the total for wrath plus x The total is years so select weights that add up to that total Angel on the west path Go one scene change to the right and pick up theblack veilon top of the cross
You see a chained angel on the other side of the path
Look at it and see sinners and the faithful
Read the inscription at the bottom Only the pious and the pure have eternal salvation and nothing to fear
You can click the heads of some of the characters in the engraving but none of the demons or children
It is unclear whether you are to identify the sinners or the faithful but clicking a head turns it black so the sinners seem the best bet
The fat gluttonous guy at the lower left The woman who is beating a child at the bottom center The woman exposing her back side The man with the bag of coins at the lower right The obese woman being carried Click the sword at the top left hear a mechanism and yes ldquo Perfect rdquo Angel at the southeast corner Come down the walkway past the gravedigger and the main gate and continue to the southeast corner where you see another chained angel
A closer look reveals an engraving of various animals and reptiles
Read the inscription at the bottom The demon is everywhere in the eye of the spider the serpent the toad and the wolves
The objective is to click the eyes of the creatures listed in the inscription the spider the snake the toad and the wolves
There are only three wolves
One is attacking the horse one is snarling at the boxer like dog and the third is howling below the horse
Now click the wolf at the upper right hear a mechanism and ldquo Perfect rdquo When you have completed all four angle puzzles you decide that the old watchman rsquo s mausoleum must now be open
Go left on the path back to the cemetery gate
Look at that urn again and see the flies
Use the black veil on them to get abag of flies
Go down the stairs across from the urn and follow around to the watchman rsquo s mausoleum on the north side
The mausoleum is indeed open so go inside
Pick up the book from the top of the coffin and read part of it in the documents
It tells how a secret passage from the cemetery to the manor came to be and it describes its location as the northeast angle corner between a tomb without a cover and a large Gothic cross
Leave the mausoleum and go up the nearby north stairs
You want the northeast corner so go up screen
There you see a tomb with no cover and the cross at the corner
Between them is a tomb with a gold edging
Use the iron bar on the cover of the tomb and enter the secret passage
Godalming Manor Try the door and see that it has a lock
The objective is to move all the buttons to the right side
Each button controls two other buttons
Button Controls This table shows that there are three easy solutions and or and or and
Now you are in the cellar of the manor
Note that the secret passage was hidden behind the shelves in the back
Look around at everything
Take thenailsat the front left corner of the work bench
Take theglass jarunder the work bench
Take theplierson the floor next to the large green jar on the left
Come down screen and look some more
Take thesawthat is leaning against the stairs
Go up the stairs and through the door into the kitchen where you see that idiot Hendrick eating insects
Look around at everything
Take thefileon the floor right in front of you and take thewooden spoonthat is on the table
You don rsquo t want to make noise by going through the other door
In inventory combine the bag of flies with the glass jar
Then give the jar of flies to Hendrick
Now you can go through the door into the lower hallway
Come down screen to the front door of the man
Take thecaneon the left of the door
Go back up to the kitchen door and enter the door across from it
Look at everything especially the brown safe on the wall behind you
You can rsquo t open it yet
Come down screen and look around
Take thepieces of woodfrom the floor in the back right corner
Exit the room
Head up the stairs and stop at the first landing
Look around especially at the candle on the back wall
It seems loose so unfasten it with the pliers
Now look at the panel and see that some kind of key is needed to unlock it
Continue up the stairs and enter the door on the left to Lady Godalming rsquo s bedchamber
Pick up and read the brown message that is on the floor directly below the tilted painting
It refers to the man of the house touching a ldquo torchiere rdquo Is that the candle that you just removed from the secret panel at the landing
Take thespoolof threadon the floor next to the blue material
Come down screen and look at the jacket on the floor next to the bed
Hendrick must be using this room now
Take thetape measureon the floor at the end of the bed and themalletthat is under the boarded up window
Exit the room out to the hallway and come down screen to a locked door
You feel that this room is important but you can rsquo t enter the door
Come back and enter the library across the hallway from the bedroom
Look around at everything especially the panel on the wall next to the huge clock
It is similar to the one downstairs but you still can rsquo t do anything with it
Go right and look around
There is a box of various items on the table
Take thewriting papersthat are beside the box
Now it is time to figure out how to open that safe downstairs
The keys to solving the problem are the panel down there and the panel here in the library
Return to the panel next to the clock
Inspect the panel to see Latin words and raised rectangles below them
Use the inventory icon and take a piece of paper
Drag the paper all the way to the bottom and click to get atemplatefor the raised rectangles
Now go back down to the salon and look at the metal panel left of the door
The main difference between this panel and the one upstairs is that this one has dials below the raised rectangles
There is also a compass in the upper right corner that seems to correspond to the dials
As before click the inventory icon and take a paper
Use paper on the metal panel drag it to the bottom and click to get anothertemplate This template has higher holes so call this the salon template
Go back upstairs and enter the library
Use the salon template on the metal panel and move it down over the words
Letters can be seen through the holes N E N S SE E Click to enter these letters in your reports
Go back to the salon downstairs and repeat the process
Use the other template on the metal panel and move it down over the words to see more letters SE E N SE N SE
Again click to enter the letters in your reports
Back away from the metal plate
Now you have the information needed to open the safe
The code consists of the two sets of letters SE E N SE N SE N E N S SE E where N North S South and SE Southeast
The markers on the dials correspond to these same directions as shown on the compass at the upper right
Set the dials in the sequence above
When the safe opens take thekey
Now you can tackle that secret door at the stairs landing the door that needs a special key
Go there look at the panel and see that there are four holes
Click any of the holes and decide that you must first measure the depth of the holes
In inventory combine the spool of thread the measuring tape and the wooden spoon to get a measuring instrument
Use the instrument on all four holes to measure their depths and centimeters
These measurements are entered in documents
Go back into the kitchen and through the other door
Go down the stairs to the work bench in the cellar
Look at the vise to get a close view of the key making area
There is a ruler and a collection of brown dowels below it
Along the right side are the file the nails the mallet and the saw
Take a dark brown dowel and drag it to below the ruler so that one end is at the end of the ruler and then click it into place
Drag the saw over so that the tip of the saw is at the marker on the ruler
Click to cut the dowel
Then drag the dowel up and insert it into the top hole of the thick vertical dowel above
Repeat this process for dowels cut to and centimeters with the cut dowels placed in the holes in that order from top to bottom
Now drag the big light dowel to under the ruler and click it into place
Use the saw to cut the dowel
This appears to be trial and error
Keep trying until you find the proper length which should be centimeters
Drag the cut dowel up and insert it into the large hole on the left side of the vertical dowel above
Drag the file over to the dowels and use it on each one to shape them
Drag the nails over and insert them in the side opposite each of the five dowels
Finally use the mallet on the nails to cinch the nails
Now you have ahomemade key
Return to the landing and use the homemade key on the panel to open it
After you enter the secret passage go up the stairs
Watch out for that hole with stakes
Go up to the locked door and open it with the key that you found in the safe
Now you are in Dracula's room
The open window suggests that Dracula flew out that way Look around at everything
In particular there is a pentagram design that needs additional information to solve
Walk left and look around
Open the book that is on the middle shelf of the right bookcase
Look at the page and see a sketch that looks like the pentagram design
The sketch shows symbols in the triangular sections and text in the outer circular segments
It also shows the jewels at the tips of the pentagon
Return to the book with the pentagon design under the Dracula portrait
The first task is to display symbols in the triangular sections and text in the circular sections
You can do these in either order
No solution is needed here because the puzzle is very easy

Click any two blank triangular or circular sections to interchange them

Click the bat above
Symbols or text will appear on any section that is in the right place

Repeat steps and until all the sections have been filled in
The final task is to move the jewels out to the tips of the pentagon
Note As far as I can tell there are no clues to help you know the positions in which the jewels are supposed to be
If you move a jewel to a particular tip and then press the bat the jewel will light up if it is in the right location
If it isn rsquo t then try other locations until the jewel lights when the bat is pressed
In this way you can trial and error your way through
There is a rumor however that too many failures could cause the bat to lose all its blood which resets the whole puzzle
I did not experience this myself but the puzzle will definitely reset if you place all the jewels incorrectly and then press the bat
Here is the solution Jewel Location Black top right Red bottom right White top left Blue bottom Green bottom left Read Dracula's book to learn more than just about anyone would want to know
The bottom line is that he yearns for the return of his beloved Irina and he needs to find the Demonomicon of Wliwggi in Cairo
You need to get back to Mina to save her
Hendrick is seen walking along the upper hallway
Leave by way of the door with swords go down the stone steps and automatically return to Mina's apartment
Mina's Apartment Observe the basket of garlic but it hasn rsquo t been strung up around the windows as you instructed
Try Mina's door in the background but you feel a ldquo presence rdquo Grab the crucifix and enter Mina rsquo s bedroom
Too late
Dracula has already bitten Mina and after threatening you flies off in the form of a bat
Read the telegram that you sent to Seward MD Director of Carfax Sanatorium and a former disciple
You have asked for his help with Mina and for your battle with Dracula
Presumably later Seward emerges from Mina rsquo s bedroom and tells you about her condition
Come down screen and use the wall map to display a map of Europe
Based on Dracula rsquo s journal select Cairo at the bottom right of the screen
You tell Seward your plans to find the Demonomicon before Dracula does or lacking that to destroy Dracula
Cairo Don rsquo t bother trying to talk to any of the loiterers in the streets because you don rsquo t speak the language
Go forward to the market place
The sign on top of the building at the right edge of the screen indicates that you are in right place because eventually you will need a camel
Continue forward toward the building with the sign
Mustapha is the man in the red fez
He is a perpetually tormented fellow who at least provides some comic relief
Talk to him and arrange for an inconspicuous room
He also more or less gives you directions to the Egyptian Museum Return to where you came from and check the sign on the post of the camels rsquo stall
It points in the direction of the museum
Go right along the path at the bottom right of the screen
You automatically end up inside the museum
Look around and then come down screen to the man sitting at a table along the back wall
Talk to him and learn that he is the assistant director of the museum
He is too busy to assist you so offer to help to him
He gives you a list recorded in the documents of items that you are to find in the museum
After you look at the list ask him what a deben is
After he explains he gives acopper debenand astylusto you
Also pick up the Giza pyramids sketch from the desk
Now it is time to search for the items on the list but you might as well take any other items that you can
Go right to the back end of the shelves
Outer Right Shelves Take the excavationpapyrusfrom the middle shelf
Take theflailand theminiature pyramidfrom the front shelves
Also take thekeythat was under the pyramid
Inner Right Shelves Turn to the inner right shelves by clicking the footprints on the shelves themselves not forward or back along the aisle
Look at the foreground shelves and take thepyramidand theknifewith a mother of pearl handle
Center Shelves Come down screen and right to the desk to face the center shelves
Take thepharaoh with a broken headfrom the front table Take theSpanish helmetfrom the end shelf on the left
Take thepyramidand the greencrookthat are on top the chest below where the helmet was Come down screen to see more of the center shelves and tables
Take the granite scarab from the shelf on the left and the pyramid from the center table
Inner Left Shelves Go around to the right of the door to see the inner left shelves
Take thehead with a solar diskand thepyramidin the foreground shelves
Look at the small chest at eye level and use the key you found earlier to open it
Take thepyramidfrom inside the chest
Far Left Wall Use the footprints in the bottom right corner of the screen to go to the far left wall
Place the crook and the flail in the hands of the sarcophagus next to the mummy
When it opens take thepyramidthat is hidden inside
Now that you have found all the items in the list go up screen to return to the assistant director and talk to him
You learn about the worship of the black sphinx and the Demonomicon which might be at the Blood Rocks
He doesn rsquo t think anyone would agree to take you there
Note This conversation covers a lot of ground and goes by somewhat quickly
Remember that you can review the entire discussion by reading it in the Dialogues
Exit the museum and you are automatically back with Mustapha rsquo s camels
Walk up past the camels to find Mustapha
Talk to him and learn that his camels are all sick
You cut a deal with him to use one of his camels if you can find a cure and you pay triple the fee
He mentions a monk that might know of a remedy and tells you where you can find him
Go past Mustapha to the left and see the monk standing on his porch
Come down and talk to Herodotus of Judas
He wants you to find out what is wrong the camels
Go back to the market place
Take thedishfrom the ledge behind Mustapha
Take thepitchforkthat is leaning on the cart
Use the pitchfork to remove the herbs in the water trough in front of the camels
Return left to Herodotus the monk and show the herbs to him
He tells you they are poisonous and when burned they will scare snakes away something that will be useful later
He gives you an antidote for one of the camels and he issues dire warnings about Blood Rocks
Return to Mustapha and give the antidote to him
He guides you to Blood Rocks
The Temple at Blood Rocks Enter the temple only to have the door blocked by a rock slide
Dracula's henchman has covered the exit with boulders so you will need to find another way out
Look around the room
Pick up aplankfrom the pile on the left
Take theturbanandpick headon the right
Come down screen and go right at the next wall
You see an abyss with stakes at the bottom
Look to the right of the hole and see that there is an opening down there
Place the plank on the far side of the abyss cross over and take thelantern
Continue up screen and see that you can go left or right at the tee
First go left and discover the body of a woman who was wearing a black sari
Pick up thebelton the ground beside her body
Look at the metal door and see that it has a sun figure in the center
There is also a cross with slots at each of the four ends
The right indentation smells of garlic and the bottom one appears to be for a liquid
Back away return to the tee and continue forward along the right into some kind of medicine room
Look at everything and learn that it is a mummification room
Take theoil flaskfrom the table on the right
Take thelinen stripsfrom the front right corner of the medicine table
Leave this room and come back down to the abyss
In inventory combine the linen strip the belt and the turban to get arope
Tie the rope to the plank
Now combine the oil flask and the lantern and then use the match on the lantern
Use the lit lantern on the rope to go down into the abyss At the bottom pick up thewooden spikeon the floor right at your feet
Go up screen through the hallway and discover a skeleton recently crushed by boulders
Pick up some ldquo curious plants rdquo from the bag near the skeleton rsquo s head
These are the same kind of plants that poisoned Mustapha rsquo s camels
Look to the upper right of the boulders and see an opening
Combine the pick head and spike to get apick
Use the pick to enlarge the opening
The pick breaks but the spike is still intact
Exit the temple through the opening
One outside you see your old friend Herodotus the monk and thank goodness he brought a camel Talk to the monk
You tell him that you are seeking the Demonomicon but you don rsquo t think it is here in the temple any longer
You tell Herodotus why you are seeking that tome
Herodotus tells you about the history of the temple how an ancient priest kept guard over the sealed tomb by which he means the door with the sun and cross that you saw earlier
The sun disk needs to be recovered along with the objects for the ends of the arms of the cross in order to reproduce the seal
You need to find these artifacts that were taken by the looters and the by the authorities
These artifacts are kept in the museum and Herodotus gives a list to you
Cairo You automatically return to Mustapha rsquo s area of the marketplace
He tells you that his wife's niece is missing and that she wears a black sari
Oh goodness that was who you saw in the temple
You have Herodotus rsquo list in inventory but you the player can rsquo t see what is on it
All you can do is just start finding things
Come down screen and then go to the steps into the market area at the far left
This puts you in front of a stall
Again you can rsquo t get anywhere talking to the stall owner
Take thegarlicfrom the post on the left
Take theflaskand thepan balancefrom the right table
We can only assume that you actually paid for these items and aren rsquo t a simple thief
Leave the marketplace and return to the museum by the path at the bottom right
Talk to the assistant director and an assassin throws a knife at you
Take theknifefrom the bookcase and themirrorfragment from the right end of the table
Give Herodotus' list to the assistant director
He confirms that those Coptic artifacts are indeed here in the museum but there is a lot of red tape for getting them back
He doubts that the authorities would ever consent
He throws you a bone by giving you ahinu receptacleas a souvenir
Then he seems to have an idea
Many valuable items have been stolen or embezzled
If you can recover them the authorities will probably ignore the Coptic artifacts and he will give them to you
Finally he gives anecklaceto you one with a diamond of great value
Leave the museum and return to Mustapha
Show the knife to Mustapha
He says that the knife is an Ottoman blade that is owned by a Turk
This Turk is the head of smugglers and thieves so maybe he is in possession of the stolen items the museum wants back
Mustapha says that the Turk has left his house and tells you how to get there
Exit to the right
Then take the path to the left past the stairs into the marketplace
You arrive at a house with ivy on the walls
Try to enter the door and you are confronted with a puzzle
At the left is a ball pattern that looks somewhat like a ldquo rdquo The objective is to move the balls to create that arrangement
The red rectangle resets the puzzle
When you move your cursor over a ball that can be moved you see one or more red arrows that indicate the direction s in which the ball can be moved
Click the red arrow to execute the move
Moving a ball at the end of a column or row moves all the adjacent balls in that column or row
Note Although a little tedious this is not a difficult puzzle
I will not offer a ldquo solution rdquo because there are many many different ways to go about it and any approach you take will involve quite a few steps
Just keep your eye on the target pattern For a step by step solution see the walkthrough by MaGtRo at Gameboomers com
Once the door is open go inside the Turk rsquo s house
The items of interest are on the chest at the bottom left and the table at the bottom right
Take thepyramidand theblack sphinxfrom the chest
You copy the hieroglyphs of the black sphinx
Pick up theaxethat is in front of the chest
Look at the items on the table and take the torn parchment from the table
Assemble the pieces by dragging them into place and using right click to rotate them
The completed parchment shows hieroglyphs and it is copied into your Documents
Come down screen and try the door by clicking the padlock
The urn next to the door teeters and breaks and a cobra crawls out to block your way
Place the curious plant on the on the brazier and watch as the smoke knocks out the cobra
Pick up thekeynear the broken vase and use it on the padlock to open the door
Go into the next room which is apparently where the Turk stored the stolen loot
Take thesolar diskthat is leaning against the back wall
Take thegold powderfrom the shelf to the left of the window
Take the scrolls and the letter from the vase on the low table at the bottom right
The first letter establishes a link between the Turk and Dracula
The second is a note written by Dracula after a short stay in Cairo and on the verge of his trip back to Europe
He wants you dead
Leave the house and return to the museum
The assistant director thanks you for finding the loot
The Turk rsquo s name is Suleiman but the authorities have not caught him yet
You are given a bag that contains theCoptic artifacts
Show the Turk's letter the parchment with hieroglyphs to the assistant director
He says that you can use the book on his table to decipher the hieroglyphs
Pick up the book and Turk rsquo s page of hieroglyphs appears
Each word on the left is a translation of one of the hieroglyphs
Drag the word under the corresponding hieroglyph and click it into place
Unfortunately you get no indication of a match until the entire parchment is completed correctly at which point the hieroglyphs turn red
A few of the hieroglyphs are somewhat discernable but most are not
The open book helps a little
One approach is to try to form sentences out of the words before you start dragging the words to the hieroglyphs but the sentences are fractured and lack verbs Top Line Weapon With Magical Powers Within Seker Head Middle Line Cursed Blood Hidden Under North Altar Bottom Line Before Enter Darkness Destroy Guard Curse be on you forever This translation now appears in the Documents
Show the black sphinx to the assistant director
He explains the significance of the statuette and tells you about the phrase ldquo Ny ar lut hotep rdquo
Leave the museum and return to talk to Mustapha who remains in trouble over the missing niece
You don rsquo t reveal what you know out of fear of reprisals
Go left to the monk Herodotus and give the bag of Coptic artifacts to him
He gives a ldquo host rdquo to you and says that he doesn rsquo t know anything about the two items that the demons fear
He assumes that you do
He will create holy water by blessing it but he needs water that has never touched the ground Show the black sphinx to Herodotus
The hieroglyph on the sphinx that was translated by the assistant director is the name of the ldquo messenger of the ancient gods rdquo He goes on to explain the mystic significance of the black man with no face
Go back by the camels to figure out how to obtain water that has never touched the ground
Use the dish in inventory to get water out of the trough in front of the camels
Place the dish full of water on the grill that is below the large barrel
Now you have a dish of boiling water in your inventory
Use the knife on the necklace to pry loose the diamond
Use the diamond on the mirror to cut it into a square mirror
In inventory place the mirror over the dish of water and steam condenses on the mirror
In inventory move the flask to the mirror with condensation to fill the flask withwaterthat has never touched the ground
Return to the monk and give the flask to him
Now the monk givesholy waterto you and he tells you what to do once you are through the sealed door
You can review this in the Dialogues later when the time comes
You are automatically transported back to the Blood Rocks
The Temple at Blood Rocks Enter the temple through the opening that you hacked out earlier
Go forward climb the rope go forward again and then use the left corridor to go to the sealed door
Look at the seal and note that all the items you need are displayed along the left of the screen

Place the solar disk at the center

Put the host into the top slot

Put the garlic into the right slot

Put the mirror into left slot

Pour the holy water into the bottom slot
Now you speak in tongues and the sealed door rises
The door rises
Enter into a chamber with a whirlpool in the center basin
Now it is time to refer again to the translated hieroglyphs that were on the Turk rsquo s parchment
Weapon With Magical Powers Within Seker Head Look at the fallen statue on the right side of the chamber and see that it is the god Seker
Use the axe on the head and take thesilver spear tip
Cursed Blood Hidden Under North Altar Note that there are four altars surrounding the basin
Only the one at the bottom left is accessible
Look at that altar and see two rows of hieroglyphs
Some of the hieroglyphs are the same as those on the black sphinx which translated to ldquo Ny ar lut hotep rdquo the messenger of the ancient gods
Use the icon at the bottom of the screen to access Documents and bring up the hieroglyphs of the black sphinx
With that as a guide press the altar rsquo s hieroglyphs in the same order
The altar rotates to reveal blood underneath
Use the brown receptacle to collect ahinu of blood
This is the first of the two items Herodotus said you would need to open a secret passage
The other is a deben of gold
Leave the altar and place the pan scale on the chest at the left of the chamber
You are automatically reminded that a gold deben is grams
Pick up thedishthat is just to the left of the chest
Go to the right side of the chamber and take acopper debenfrom inside a jar
Place the dish on the pan scale
Now you have a view of the scale along with the copper deben from the museum the copper deben you just took from the jar a stylus and a scoop
Just below the scoop is a reset bar
Begin by weighing each of the items
Place the item in the left pan and then add scoops of gold dust from the bag at the bottom left to the right pan
When the two pans are in balance the weight of the item is displayed
Item Gold dust Weight copper deben from the museum scoops grams copper deben from the jar scoops grams stylus scoops grams Note that the two copper debens have a total weight of grams
The difference between that weight and the weight of the stylus grams is grams which is exactly the weight of a gold deben
Therefore place the two copper debens in one pan and the stylus in the other pan
Then add gold to the stylus pan until the scale is balanced scoops
The bowl in the bottom left corner lights up
Scoop the grams of gold into the bowl and you have agold deben
Continuing to follow Herodotus rsquo instructions place the hinu of blood and the gold deben into the basin and see the whirlpool change into sand
Only one step remains
Herodotus said that the sun must hit the summit of the Pharaoh's tombs
Look at the middle pillar at the left of the chamber
You need light so use the lit lantern on the pillar
This displays three pyramids with light beaming down on their tops
The arrows at the bottom corners are used to slide the lantern back and forth
The objective is the place a large medium and small pyramid over the lantern and to adjust the pyramid as need to cast a perfect shadow on the pyramid above it

The best place to start is with the large pyramid
Slide the lantern underneath it drag one of the large pyramids down and place it in the open space above the lantern
Now a shadow is seen on the upper pyramid
The vertical scale on the left can be used to raise or lower the pyramid
Play with the vertical scale to try to cast a perfect shadow on the upper pyramid
If this is not possible with the pyramid that you selected then try another pyramid
Keep tweaking until a perfect shadow is cast on the upper pyramid
Now repeat for the small pyramid on the right and then the medium pyramid in the center
Note The vertical scale raises and lowers all the pyramids that you have placed
Therefore once you have the large pyramid in place it is best not to use the vertical scale anymore unless you have exhausted all possibilities for the other pyramids
Once all your pyramids are casting perfect shadows you hear the usual hooray ldquo Perfect rdquo Now the only pyramids in inventory are the large medium and small pyramids
You might want to drag them side by side in inventory to help you see which is which
Now the pyramids must be placed in the sand
Refer to the document ldquo The Giza Pyramids rdquo to see the order small medium large from left to right
Light beams down to the pyramids and a secret door opens
Go through the secret door and watch as a crocodile slithers from the platform into the water
You need to make some kind of bridge to get to the other side
Return to the chamber and look at the funerary barge between the two statues
Take the metal bar from the statue on the left
Pick up the broken piece of column from the floor right of the statue on the right
Go back to the barge and look at the support on the right
Breaking it would cause the boat to fall
Use the axe on it and the supports collapse
Now use the piece of column under the right end of the boat
Wedge the metal bar between the piece of column and the boat
The pull down on the metal bar to dislodge the boat and send it skittering down the stairs
Go back down the stairs to the secret room and look at the structure atop the platform
An undead creature reaches out and an explanatory entry is made in the Reports
Walk over the barge and go forward to the darkness behind the structure
A misty supernatural force stops you and you realize that the spell must be broken
Before Enter Darkness Destroy Guard Curse be on you forever To ldquo destroy the guard rdquo go into inventory and use the axe on the black sphinx
Use the broken black sphinx on the mist and it fades away allowing you to advance
Go forward into the next room
Take the papyrus scrolls from the altar
Suddenly there is an earthquake so leave the room
You automatically return to the marketplace
Cairo Go left and talk to Herodotus
The papyrus scrolls are written in the ancient language of his order but he can rsquo t understand any of it
All hope seems lost but then he remember as European monk named Brother Alberto who said that he knew some of the language
If he is still living he might be found working as an illuminator at St Carousel Abbey in Vienna
Go back and talk to Mustapha who gives you a letter
You give him a fictional account of what happened to the niece
The story has a kernel of truth to it but it is embellished and deceptive
To add credence to it you give the gold dust to Mustapha and the diamond necklace for the niece's family
Vienna During your trip to Vienna you read the letter that Mustapha gave to you
It is from Seward who blames you for the fact that Mina is getting worse
She wants to go to Europe to join her lover
Seward and Mina will join you in Vienna
At the home of Duchess Orlowski you speak with Seward and the Duchess while Mina is sleeping
You relate your difficulties in getting into the abbey
Neither Seward no the Duchess can be of any help
However Seward does recall that the abbey signed over some of its property to the university so that a library could be built
Duke Orlowski insisted that there be a door connecting the library and the abbey
Duke Orlowski had a key to the university that he planned to give to a student who could pass a test that was to be administered in this room
He died before the test was given but the Duchess thinks that the key is still in this room
Come down screen and try the white door
The Duchess says that it leads to the library Come back down screen and look at the painting of piano keys
You copy it into your documents and you can see chemical formulas on the keys
Look at the closed panel just right of the piano and see that it is a small laboratory setup
Perhaps this is where the Duke rsquo s test was to take place
Take a page from the chemistry book on the lowest shelf of the middle section of the bookcase
The black and white smears surely were meant as a clue to the piano painting
Go back and talk to the Duchess
She hums a melody that the Duke used to play on the piano
The notes of the melody are recorded in the Documents C G D F D A C
Go back left to the small chemistry laboratory and look at it
An explanation appear in Reports
There is a rack of test tubes of differing chemicals and colors
The objective is to dip litmus paper into the test tubes in the correct order
To determine that order you must use the Duchesses rsquo melody and the Duke rsquo s painting on the wall next to the white door
In the following table the piano keys are listed from left to right
The chemicals are from the painting at the upper left and the colors are taken from the chemistry book page at the upper right
Key Chemical Color C Na CrO yellow C H SO beige D HgS red D NiO green E POCl brown F MnO black F No information G CuSO H O blue G NaOH grey A O pink A Na Cr O orange B C H O violet C TiO white In the following table the keys of the melody are shown in the top row
The bottom row shows the associated colors from the table above
C G D F D A C yellow blue green black red orange white Now drag litmus papers from the lower right corner to the test tubes in the order shown in the bottom row above
As you do this numbers appear in the white space below the test tubes Go left to the corner of the room where you see something that looks like a giant urn
Click it to reveal a safe
To open the safe use the left and right arrows at the top to move the pointer to each of the numbers above in order
Each time you point to a number click the handle on the right
Reach into the safe and take the key and the wooden angel
You also get a letter from Duke Orlowski that appears in Documents
Read the letter to learn that something sinister was going on at the university
Unlock the white door right of the bookshelves and enter
Somewhere her in the library is the secret door that leads to the abbey
Come down screen and see the long banner with the university insignia
Pull the curtain aside and see a round receiving area for the black demon and white angel pieces
This must be what Baker Orlowski rsquo s student referred to
Although you don rsquo t have all the needed pieces you can go ahead and fit the ones that are there to get some idea of the pattern
Just experiment
After only a couple of locked in pieces you will see how they will all eventually fit together
Go up screen to the dissecting table just left of the foot of the stairs
Pick up thetweezersand thescalpel
Now check the cabinet with the butterfly collection on the wall behind the table
Open the cabinet with the scalpel and take anangel
Go to the ornate radio between the bookshelves right of the butterfly cabinet and take anangel
Go up the stairs behind you and see a map of Europe
Click Transylvania a country in gray just right of center and take anotherangel
Go right along the bookcases
There is a book with an angel on the cover at the end of the first middle shelf
You might need to step forward a little so you can see it
Take theangeland read about crossbows
Come back down the stairs and go up toward the fireplace on the left
You are looking at the left side of the staircase
Pick up thepokerin the lower left corner
Try the winch and watch as the chandelier is lowered
Come back down and take themoveable stairs
Huh
Place the moveable stairs under the chandelier by clicking the stairs on the chandelier
Go up and get anotherangel
Go right of the central staircase to the anatomy display
Take thesuspendersfrom one of the skeletons
Come down screen to the Medicine shelves next to the desk
One of the large jars contains something of interest but it has a stopper
Combine the suspenders with the poker to make an ldquo obedience collar rdquo Use the obedience collar to open the jar
Then use the tweezers on the jar to get ademon
You should now have all the remaining angels and demons that you need
Go to the back wall and complete the angels and demons pattern
The secret door to the abbey opens
It took poor Baker years to figure out something that took you only a few minutes
You enter the St Carousel Abbey only to have the door close behind you
Look around at everything
You are in the anteroom of a wine cellar
Take thelinen cloththat is over a basket right of the door
The desk has a front drawer that is protected by a dragon head
Look up at the left bookcase and take St Michael'sspearfrom the statue
Use it on the dragon head to open the drawer
You find a safe with a lock The objective is to set lighted balls at all the tips
Clicking on a circle displays a ball along with paths along which the ball can be moved
One approach is to recognize that you do not want lighted balls that are two spaces apart
Doing so blocks the ball across the way from being moved
My method was to keep moving the balls to locations that arethreespaces away from the previously set ball
For example
For your first step choose any circle and move the ball to either possible location
Call it location A

Now count three spaces clockwise from the ball you just set at location A
Call this new circle location B

Keeping your eye on location B look across the way and select the circle that is connected to location B and move the ball to location B

Keep repeating steps and until only one circle is unlit

Click the final circle to open the safe
Reach into the safe and take thechaliceand thekey
Come down screen and pick up the oldbroom handlethat is next to the broom leaning near the left of the arch
Look at the wine barrel on the shelf to see that the spigot is jammed
Use the scalpel on the barrel and the alcohol pours out on the floor
This doesn rsquo t seem very productive but it will come in handy later
Go through the arch and look at the dreadful mess
Below the hanging man is a student rsquo s pack
Look at the very bottom of the screen below the rats and learn that the man must be Baker the student that the Duke mentioned in his letter
Look at the rats and decide that you must get rid of them
In inventory attach the linen cloth to the broomstick to make a torch
Now use the matches to light the torch
Finally use the lit torch to chase the rats away
Oh yes Perfect
Reach into Baker rsquo s pack and take theholy water
Go up screen under the chains to a hallway
Nothing will open the door but there is a monk rsquo s robe that will be a good disguise
Take it and automatically put it on
Return to the wine cellar and see a zombie like monk enter and threaten you
Use the lit torch on the alcohol that you spilled on the floor earlier
Pick up thekeyfrom the floor next to the ashes
Return to the hallway where you found the robe
Try the key the gold one on the locked door
Enter and see some kind of satanic worship ritual
Observe that one of the monks drinks from a chalice atop an altar on the right
You also see Brother Alberto in a cage
Come down right and talk to him
You must get rid of the zombie monks
Back away and go up inside the pentagram
Look at the chalice at the right of the pentagram
You can rsquo t just pour the holy water into the chalice
Instead in inventory combine the holy water with the chalice
Then use the chalice of holy water on the altar to swap chalices
Move away and watch the effect on the monk who drinks from the chalice
While the other two monks are er preoccupied go back and talk to Brother Alberto
His leg is broken and worse his has been blinded which means he cannot read the text
He tells how the abbey was taken over by the Prince of Darkness and how he was the only one to resist
He says that Dracula must be conquered on his own soil
If he is defeated his link to those he controls will also vanish
Poor Brother Alberto expires
Use the key the black one to unlock the door to the right of Brother Alberto
You automatically return to the home of Duchess Orlowski
Mina has been taken by Dracula
You and Seward must battle Dracula on his own soil Transylvania
On the way you make a crossbow
Transylvania Accompanied by an ill Seward you arrive at an inn that is near Dracula rsquo s castle
Speak with Seward and then automatically enter the inn
After more conversation with Seward you decide that you must proceed alone
Talk to Abraham du Varmin the temperamental innkeeper
Try to look at the menu at the left end of the counter but Abraham fusses
Look around at everything especially the decor
Come down screen and look around some more
Taketwo pretzelsfrom the bowl at the end of Seward rsquo s table
Also take thespoonand thesilverpaperfrom the table
Look at theslimy substanceon the bench at the right
Use the spoon to scrape off some of it
Try to take the silver key hanging left of the door with predictable results
Try going out the door with the same results but you conclude that the door leads to a stable and possibly a coach
Seward is getting worse
Talk to Abraham about a remedy and he leaves to find one in the stable
Now you can look at the menu on the counter but it isn rsquo t a menu at all
It is an extract from Harker rsquo s writing
Learn that Harker was made into a vampire
When Abraham returns the animal head falls and a tooth is dislodged
As Abraham tends to Seward go pick up themolarfrom the floor
In inventory combine the silver paper and the sticky substance
Then combine each of the two pretzels and the molar with the silver paper
Finally combine the three silvery parts to obtain a fake key Swap the fake key and thereal keythat is left of the door
Talk to Abraham about something a little stronger for Seward
While Abraham looks for some moonshine use the real key on the door to the stable
There is no hand cursor just use the footprints cursor
Look around at the stable especially the coach and the large barrel on top
You hatch a plan for hiding in the cask and sneaking into Dracula rsquo s castle
Of course the cask is full and turning the spigot would leave a mess that would not go unnoticed
You have another problem
If you check the horses you find that they have red eyes and they are being aggressive
You need to calm them down
Go to the work bench and pick up thebucketfrom the floor at the left end
Fill the bucket with the oats that can be found right at your feet
Go back to the horses and give them the bucket of oats
Oh wait
These are Dracula rsquo s horses
How does their master feed them
Go back to the door where there are hanging carcasses with blood dripping from them
Use the bucket of oats on the carcass to mix some blood into the oats
Try again to give the oats to the horses
Now you have made them happy and you go around to the front by coming down screen
Take the dried upbeaver's cadaverfrom beside the chopping block near the front gate
Take thewooden boxand thefunnelfrom the table as well as thetroughfrom under the table
Finally take the largetubefrom the ground in front of the horses
Return to the coach and put the wooden box on the ground in front of the back wheel
Place the trough on top of the chest the beaver carcass on top of the trough and the funnel on top of the beaver
Now place the large tube at the lower end of the trough and you have a sluiceway to the hole in the ground
Open the spigot on the cask and watch wine flow down into the hole
Click the trough to automatically dismantle the whole arrangement
You hear the sound of someone coming and you automatically climb into the cask and watch your trip to the castle
Castle Dracula The coachman will be a problem and you decide to set a trap for him
Take theleg trapfrom the end of the worktable
Note the bucket of blood on the floor right under where the trap was
Come down screen to see the door the coachman went through
There are two barrels along the left wall
Take thetwo ropesthat are on top of those barrels
At the top of the screen above the window with the swinging shutter is a pulley
Use one of the ropes on that pulley
The attach the leg trap to the rope
The trap is now resting on the ground
Attach the other rope to the trap
Note that the rope lies along the ground and runs to the right behind the coach
Go there and click the pulley that is above the table at the very top edge of the screen
This attaches the loose end of the rope on the other side
Taketwo hooksfrom the bottom end of the table
Look back down the table until you get a hand cursor at about the middle of the table
You see a dead rat that has been trapped
The two hooks you just picked up are at the bottom of the screen
You will use the hooks to open the trap so you can get the rat
Place one hook at the right of the trap and the other hook at the left of the trap
Just drag the hooks up there and keep clicking until they fall into place
Then take therat
Return to the leg trap and place the dead rat in it
Watch what happens
Talk to the coachman about Mina
Dracula has begun his ritual for bringing back his first love
The place where Dracula and Mina are is protected by a beautiful beast with black hair
Talk to Igor again
He is hungry and wants a heart with jam
Pick up theaxein front of him
Look back toward the door Igor used and see a red package near the ground
Slice the package open with the arrow for a crossbow and take thejam potwith preserved hearts
Take thegoldbowlfrom just above where the red package was
Give the jam pot to Igor who is now beholden to you
Go right and then up screen to the front of the coach
Use the bowl on that bucket of blood that you saw earlier at the end of the work table
Now you have abowl of blood
Go right and enter the door to the castle
Come down and take the oldfur coatfrom the barrel at the bottom of the screen
Take the yellowcurtain cordfrom the red material at the right
Enter the door up screen and find yourself in front of a gate that leads to a crypt
Look at the gate and then at the panel on the right
Take a look at all the elements of the panel
There is a x picture of Dracula whose tiles can be toggled off and on
At the right is a large grid with a variety of symbols in various colors
At the top and right of the grid are four symbols
Finally there are two color panels one at the top left currently all green and one at the bottom left currently all blue
The upper color panel corresponds to the four symbols at the top of the grid
The lower color panel corresponds to the four symbols at the right of the grid
It will be helpful to identify the various symbols of the grid A triangle within a triangle with a horizontal line B triangle within a triangle C triangle with a horizontal line D blank triangle Begin with the symbols at the top of the grid
The symbols are A D B D
Run your cursor over the first symbol and see one of the tiles of the Dracula painting

Find that tile in the Dracula painting and turn it over

Repeat for the remaining three symbols
A B D D
With four tiles of the Dracula picture now grayed out grab the frame of the picture and drag it over to the grid

Now find a location on the grid in which the all the symbols that appear in the holes are the same as those shown in the table above
The easiest method is to find a symbol A for example and then check to see whether the other symbols match up

Once the picture is in a correct location note the colors of the grid symbols
In this case A green D white B blue D blue
In the upper left color panel set those colors in order
Now follow exactly the same procedure for the symbols at the right of the grid
To avoid confusion it will help to restore the picture before you begin
C B D D Set the color panel at the lower left to C green B white D red D white When you are successful the gate rises
Enter the crypt
Look at the coffin in front of you
Click the name Moana and the number to enter the information in your Reports
Now click the near end of the coffin to open it and see the skeleton of a vampire
Check the Reports and see the observation that she had red hair In summary Moana red hair Working counterclockwise open the coffin on the left
There is nothing of interest here
Continuing counterclockwise look at the cover of the next coffin
Again click the name Illona and the number to enter the information in Reports
Check the Reports for the note that Illona was a blonde
In summary Illona blonde hair Now look at the coffin in the foreground
It is Dracula rsquo s coffin and must be destroyed
Smash the coffin with the axe
Look at the dead bird below the coffin on the right
Open the coffin to find your friend Harker
Take Harker's journal from the end of the coffin
He writes about how he was turned into a vampire by a black haired ldquo initiator rdquo He also describes what he had learned about Pelor the shield of the Sun
Take theglassesfrom Harker rsquo s hand
Take and read the book at the side of the coffin to learn more about the Pelor shield
In inventory combine the stake and the mallet and use the result on Harker to give him peace
Leave the crypt come down screen and enter the door on the right
Walk to the left side of the great hall and look at the bluish white painting on the floor in the corner Fiat lux ldquo Let there be light rdquo Look at the large tapestry on the wall and then zoom in
There two things to see here
Look at Dracula rsquo s shield
Look at the rose colored ribbon the left arm of the knight in gold at the left
In Dracula rsquo s diary he mentioned a knight who stole his beloved
This must be the guy
Look at his shield to see two slivers of the moon that face in opposite directions
Left of the tapestry is a curtain with a cord
Pull the cord to reveal a portrait of a woman and then pick up thecordfrom the floor
Look closer at the painting and note that the area around her left wrist looks smudged
Zoom in on that area and use Harker's glasses
Keep moving the glasses around and clicking
Try to get the darker pink parts in the two lenses
Obviously someone has tried to erase the pink areas and your Report indicates that the erased item was a ldquo dazzling rose rdquo Surely this must be Irina Dracula's first and only love and the lady who Dracula wants to bring back to life
Go left and then across the hall to the other side where you see three more paintings
Look at the recent portrait of Dracula in the middle
Look at the other two portraits and at their nameplates
Illona with blonde hair is on the left Moana with red hair is on the right
Go right and open the door in the back not the door on the right
Jada emerges and is not impressed with your crucifix
This is surely the black haired ldquo initiator rdquo of whom Harker wrote
She is deluded into thinking that she is Dracula rsquo s only true love
An important comment to note is that she has spent nights with Dracula
By my calculations that rsquo s nearly years poor girl
Well anyway you are obviously not going to get past her through this door
Try the main door on the right and see that it can rsquo t be opened
Go right through the yellow lit arch
Look at the sword at the center of the grate and see that it is actually a lock with a dial You don rsquo t have enough information to unlock the grate
Who can help
Remember that Igor the coachman owes you one because you gave heart jam to him
Exit back out in the great hall and then come down left to the door at the end of the hall
Exit the great hall and continue forward through the left door
Talk to Igor and learn that the numbers on the coffins of Moana and Illona are the numbers of nights the women were with Dracula
Igor then gives clues regarding the combination lock ldquo times the night with a white moon plus times the night with a red moon plus times the night with a black moon rdquo His word ldquo moon rdquo must refer to the women rsquo s hair Woman Hair Number Illona blonde x Moana red x Jada black x Sum Return to the great hall and the armory
Set the dials on the sword to and the grate opens
Look at the middle shelf on the left and take thecoat of mailand thecrossbow without a string
Look at the lower three shields
Is one of these the Pelor shield
Recall Harker rsquo s journal in which he wrote that there were many forgeries and that it would take some ingenuity to identify the real one
The middle shield can be recognized as that of the gold knight in the tapestry because it has two slices of the moon facing in opposite directions
The chances are good that this is the one
Now review the book you picked up from Harker rsquo s coffin the Myths and Legends book
It refers to ldquo crossing rdquo the two moons
It goes on to say that the arrows must be aimed so that the ldquo golden darts target the neighbouring silver and that silver in his turn points towards a nearby bronze rdquo First click the two moons completely around so that they face or ldquo cross rdquo each other
Now to set the arrows
Clicking the outer ring turns it clockwise the inner ring turns counterclockwise
A gold arrow must point to a silver circle and a silver arrow must point to a bronze circle
A simple solution is to keep clicking the inner ring until you say ldquo Pelor rdquo Now theshieldis in your inventory
Leave the armory and try Jada rsquo s door the one on the left
You need something to attract her
Place the bowl of blood on the floor in front of the door
She emerges and takes the bowl of blood but there you are with the shield ldquo Let there be light rdquo Jada curses you to the end but it appears there will be no night number with Dracula
Enter Jada's bedroom and look around at everything
Pick up thepot of greasefrom the floor on your left
Look at the coffin the foreground and see that it is another Dracula model
As before destroy it with the axe
Take thekeynear the head of the coffin
Take and read the book The Vermis Mysteris Mysteries of the Worm
It will be helpful to know later that ldquo elemental forces that comes from the centre of earth or from the skies can cause harm to this black ones rdquo Destroy the other coffin with the axe also
Look at the picture of Jada the lovely brown haired girl
Apparently her hair turned black after becoming a vampire
Look at the mandolin that is leaning against the bed
Its strings are still good so cut one off astringwith the crossbow arrow
Combine this string and the crossbow
Leave the room and enter the large door with the key that you took from Dracula's coffin
You are clearly near your show down
You will need to get past the green mist of spirits to save Mina who is levitated while Dracula is performing a ritual
Recall the book you just took from Dracula rsquo s coffin
Elemental forces from the sky can disperse the green spirits
Perhaps the lightning
Look at the metal top of the bookcase
The bookcase is on tracks that lead to the right toward a puddle by the left statue
Look at the tracks to see that the bookcase is movable but the mechanism is jammed
Use the pot of grease on the railing
Now push the book case to the right
Approach the silver statue on the left and see that it is made of metal
Drop the coat of mail into the puddle by the statue
Combine the two cords in inventory and tie them to the statue rsquo s foot
Go right and see that the lightning has caused a gap in the mist
Place the fur coat near the cord so that you can go through the gap
First though get your weapon ready
Combine the crossbow and arrow and select it from inventory
Sneak through the mist and watch the end scenes

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
Dragon Riders Chronicles of Pern Walkthrough by JeninChgo rev rev
I rsquo ve never written a WT before so hopefully this will be informative as well as entertaining
This is a long game therefore it goes to reason that this will be an even longer WT
Mostly because I rsquo m writing it I rsquo m going to start out very detailed amp later shorten things assuming by then you know how to use the interface
If you rsquo re looking for the solve to or how to trigger a particular quest sub quest scan the WT for the various quest recap lists listed in order received amp kept on the list until solved
If you find it on the list amp it says SOLVED next to it the section between the last quest list amp this is where you need to look for your information
If you rsquo re having a problem check the BUGS TIPS section
If I rsquo ve missed something or made a horrible error please let me know
If there rsquo s any typos the butler did it
A few words about this game Adventure gamers might be put off playing this due to its reputation of action amp timed sequences not to mention keyboard controls
I want to clarify that this is adventure amp of the lsquo icky rsquo stuff
Of that it is easy once you know how If I can do it you can too
However I rsquo m comfortable with using the keyboard controls
If you rsquo re not you probably will be frustrated with this game The mouse is not used at all
I felt this game worth the annoyances
It rsquo s got story folks
There are no mazes and jumps are all done in cut scene so there rsquo s no falling off ledges
The game is somewhat linear where you need to do certain actions to trigger other actions amp move the story along or you need to be a certain level before you can do something
However a lot of the quests sub quests can be done at any time so the order I rsquo ve done things in may not be the same order you rsquo ve done them
If you miss something a sub quest may not trigger and you simply will not get that quest
The journal is a good indicator
It fills in periodically as you gather information
Blank pages or sections indicate missing information
You may need to reload an earlier save in order to get information written to the journal that you may have missed
It is not necessary to finish the game
You will never miss a main plot quest just for the completionists out there
We know who we are

There is no apparent way to skip cut scenes
This will become your biggest annoyance in the game as every time you fly your dragon to a new land you rsquo ll have a long one to endure
Think of it as intermission amp take the opportunity to use the bathroom get a snack take a nap most likely it will still be playing when you return to the computer
There rsquo s also a few known bugs
You may experience more or none at all
None I rsquo ve encountered have been game stopping
Just strange or annoying
I hope this list doesn rsquo t stop you from playing as I said none are game stopping
Most are just strange visuals or quirks that can be overcome
BUGS TIPS Problems
Look here Camera Angles Sometimes the camera angle swings wildly amp you cannot see very well
This happens most often during fights of course
Pressing the right or left arrow key usually swings you around so you can see what you rsquo re doing
You may need to move forward or back as well but try swinging around first so you can still hit your enemy
Save often just in case
You usually know when you rsquo re about to fight amp have the opportunity to do so
In other cases the camera doesn rsquo t swing amp what you think is a dead end is actually a turn
You should be getting a close up view amp instead you rsquo re far away amp it rsquo s hard to see if there is a corner to turn
Hug walls when exploring leave no corner unturned
Sometimes exiting amp reentering an area fixes it The strangest camera glitch by far is the pinhole view
Hard to explain unless you get the bug but the screen turns black except for a small circle which is stretched into bands like a time warp or sun rays
Using the arrow keys to move your character usually brings the screen back to normal
Voice When you set up the game make sure you choose subtitles text option in addition to voice
The audio cuts out sometimes during conversations amp you rsquo d otherwise miss out on what was said
Scarecrows This happened to me once amp freaked me out
After killing some guards in the prison level I saved the game
When I returned to the game all the bodies were standing upright in a T formation just like scarecrows
They remained like that even after reloading
They are still dead non interactive but very freaky to see
Giants In one part of the game I was exploring amp I saw a woman sweeping in the distance
When approaching her to talk she was enormous in size
Clearly four times as large as D rsquo kor
You should have seen the size of her broom
Pressing Spacebar initiated conversation amp she popped back down to normal size
Good thing because she gave me a key
It would have been as large as D rsquo Kor
There were a few other places in the game where giants were spotted
Just another strange video glitch
Sneak Mode In several parts of the game you will be required to sneak past an enemy
It rsquo s just a matter of pressing the action button when you see the sneak icon usually
However sometimes when the icon is present you cannot seem to enter sneak mode
Here rsquo s the scoop
Once you rsquo ve visited several areas you rsquo ll notice that the default changes depending on the area from walk to run or vise verse
Meaning pressing the up arrow in one place might make you walk while in a different area doing the same action would make you run
There rsquo s no rhyme or reason to it
Holding the Left Shift key toggles between the two so if default is walk holding L Shift and the up arrow will make you run
Sneak mode will only work when you rsquo re in walk mode
Running turns it off
So if you rsquo re at a sneak spot you rsquo ll know and you can rsquo t enter sneak mode try holding the L Shift key in addition to the action button spacebar
I can rsquo t get no satisf ACTION I encountered this annoyance in several parts of the game
When there rsquo s more than one action in a small location your dragon cursor will sometimes not reveal the other actions amp favor one in particular
This most often occurred in combination with sneak mode
The point is if you rsquo re standing in front of a button but are not getting an action icon to push said button and instead are getting an icon to sneak press the zero INS key on the numeric key pad to scroll through available actions
This also works well when trying to talk to a particular person in a group but your dragon insists you keep speaking to someone else over amp over
Hit ins to scroll through the people
I also encountered this when in sneak mode amp there was something on the ground to pick up
I kept getting the sneak icon even though I was already in sneak mode amp couldn rsquo t get the pick up icon
Pressing ins solves this
This only works if there rsquo s an action icon at the top of the screen
Incorrect Leads A few of the characters will give you unintentional bogus information
Usually it rsquo s just a name amp the correct person is near the person they told you to talk to
Nothing major just be aware so if you rsquo re trying to solve a particular quest amp that person isn rsquo t helping it might not be them you need to speak with
Try others nearby
There rsquo s one instance where a location is wrong
The habitat is correct the name of the place you rsquo re told is wrong
Don rsquo t worry about it You rsquo ll stumble upon it eventually
Interactive items people are difficult to miss regardless of bad info
Inventory In one part of the story you get all of your inventory taken from you
You soon get it back but I encountered a bug where I saved just after the items were taken
When I reloaded my game the inventory was there again
I encountered a fight amp had weapon ready only to find that I fought bare fisted amp died
Not a big deal as I had just saved but it could have been This only happened at this point in the game
The rest of my deaths were all my fault
Save Menu The game automatically saves upon entering a new area with a ldquo Loading rdquo symbol
This top slot in the save menu overwrites itself automatically so you will need to save manually as well if you want to save more than just your current location
You will only get four available manual slots in the Save menu
In the Load menu you will get five open slots plus the automatic save up top if you rsquo ve never saved before
This threw me for a loop for the longest time
The thslot is for Quick Save or F
Pressing this will save the game without going through the menu
Pressing F again will overwrite the game in the thQuick Save slot
So in essence there rsquo s two slots for quick saves but you only control one
Just understand there rsquo s only four slots for regular saves Unlimited would have been nice as there rsquo s some places where if you miss something a quest will not trigger or you rsquo ll be unable to complete a task
I rsquo ll note these spots in the WT with a big WARNING
However they are only sub quests amp entirely unnecessary to finish the game
Fighting Other than the weird camera angles at times there rsquo s no bugs
Here rsquo s a tip
You rsquo ll learn to fight very early in the game from a teacher
The teacher makes it far more complicated than it really is
You rsquo ll have to follow his instructions to pass the learning portion which is easy
Do yourself a favor amp forget what he taught you All you need to know is this When you see the crossed sword action icon at the top of the screen make sure your weapon is equipped amp face the enemy
Walking inch toward them a little at a time until they come toward you then stop walking amp start swinging
Hold down the action key spacebar and tap the up arrow key repeatedly
Don rsquo t bother with turning while fighting unless you can rsquo t see blocking defensive or hard swings
You rsquo ll only get hurt killed trying to be fancy or at least I did
Keep it simple
Tapping the up arrow kills everything pretty quickly with little damage to yourself
You rsquo ll usually know when there rsquo s a fight about to happen so remember to save incase things don rsquo t work out in your favor or if you get hurt badly
Have you seen my lizard
You rsquo ll collect lsquo Fire Lizard Eggs rsquo throughout the game
A fire lizard is the small dragon flying near you which acts as your cursor
When you collect an egg you rsquo ll take it to your room amp hatch it to create a different colored one
You can replace your current dragon with a newly hatched one
The only difference is color amp it rsquo s not necessary to anything in the game
Just a custom option
There are six eggs to hatch but even though I hatched them all I only was able to use the rust blue amp green dragons
The bronze gold amp white disappeared as soon as they were hatched
I rsquo ve put their pictures on milk cartons
This tip is from George Sarosky aka Buzman the missing fire lizards are in another room on a completely different perch behind what looks like a bathtub
It rsquo s the room connected to D rsquo kor rsquo s bedroom where you pick up the brush for Zenth in the beginning
You rsquo ll have to walk around the lsquo bathtub rsquo to see it
So this isn rsquo t a bug it rsquo s just a bad camera angle

Weyr Hall Weyrbowl Lower Level LL Upon entering you see a windmill surrounded by water amp off to the left a small bridge to a cottage with smoke rising from the chimney
Let rsquo s head there our journal said Ramalla might be there
Run toward the bridge ignoring everything else for the time being
Once over the bridge turn left
Enter the white door by pressing Spacebar
Ramalla Kendrick rsquo s Cottage Talk to Ramalla to complete that quest
You have found your first Weyrwoman candidate
Exit the cottage
Walk away from the door and the camera angle changes to show the windmill
Let rsquo s check it out
Head over the little bridge in front of you not the same one you just crossed to get to the cottage
Windmill Once on the island with the windmill talk to the Miller
You can try to help him by pressing Spacebar while standing by the stuck lever
It won rsquo t budge yet because we need to achieve a strength of level ldquo Formidable rdquo We rsquo re wimps now
Yet another quest we rsquo ll have to come back to
Just a note that it pays to write some of this stuff down for future reference
If you haven rsquo t noticed only certain things register in the journal as quests
Some like this stuck windmill are bonuses sidequests but it rsquo s up to you to keep track of them
Go back over the bridge toward the cottage
When the camera angle changes you rsquo ll see the cottage a well and a stable next to yet another little bridge
Walk to the well
Well Once you rsquo re next to the Well you should get a hand action icon
Press enter to use the Well
Feeling like a total wimp
Well again we have to return here once we rsquo ve beefed up
This one however is at least noted for us in our journal
Let rsquo s cross that other little bridge by the stable
You can check inside the stable but there rsquo s nothing in there
Weyr Hall Weyrbowl Lower Level LL Cross the bridge and see Hal hammering away at a large rock
Pass him for now and talk to Perry sitting on the cart
Perry rsquo s the ore trader
We should report this to S rsquo bor but let rsquo s finish here first
Go around to the other side of the card amp find Jax petting the herdbeast
Talk to him if you want but he rsquo s not helpful yet
He will be in a minute
There rsquo s a large archway cut out in the wall to the left
If you head there you rsquo ll find it blocked by Jillan
Talk to him to get a small crossbow amp the ongoing six bug quest
Now we rsquo ve got our bug catching gear
Turn around and walk away from Jillan
You should see a little girl wearing a blue shirt playing near the water
Talk to Helan to learn more about the missing Jim
She rats out Jax so now let rsquo s go talk to him
He rsquo s hiding now eavesdropping on our conversation with Helan
From facing Helan and the cart in the background turn completely around so they are behind D rsquo kor
D rsquo kor should be facing you the screen
Walk forward blindly until the camera angle changes and you should spot Jax
He rsquo s behind a set of rocks just to the right of that large archway Jillan is guarding
Talk to Jax
He rsquo ll tell you more about Jim and offer you a map of the Dark Caves
Take it
View the map by pressing TAB
Talk to Jax again and he rsquo ll point you to the cave entrance
Hug the rock wall behind Jax and head right
You rsquo ll see another little bridge
Just before the bridge is a cave with some large boulders blocking it
Once you get close enough you rsquo ll find Mullen amp the cave entrance
After the tiny cut scene talk to Mullen again
We need to find something to smash the boards
We have nothing in inventory that can do this but we did see someone who rsquo s got the right tool
Turn back around amp head back toward the cart
Talk to Hal to borrow his hammer
Run back to the cave but before you do anything walk to the little bridge next to it
Notice the light green plant to the right
Walk to it amp a hand action icon appears
Press Spacebar to pick it up
Now because we are not skilled or knowledgeable we do not know what kind of herb this is
It could be a healing herb or it could be poisonous
Keep it in inventory for now
Okay let rsquo s go find Jim
Walk over to the cave entrance
You rsquo ll have to be in front of Mullen to get the proper action icon
Equip the hammer in inventory by highlighting it with your gold bracket cursor amp press Enter
Press Enter again to break the boards down
Follow Mullen into the Dark Caves
Dark Caves Follow Mullen to a blocked passage amp you rsquo ll get a small cut scene
With the hammer equipped press Enter to smash your way through the rocks
Follow Mullen into the passage
Keep following him to a bridge
You should get a cut scene
Cross the bridge and it collapses behind you
Wonderful
Mullen will run off for help
Up ahead you see some sort of animal moving about
That my friend is a Tunnel Snake and they bite
Hard
Equip your knife by highlighting it in inventory amp pressing Enter
It will not show up in the gold circle but it will have a gold glow around it
Save your game here
Once equipped head toward the snake but don rsquo t get too close
Now you can kill the snake or you can run past it amp take the right side path
I say kill it now so we don rsquo t accidently bump into it later
Walk toward the snake until you get a crossed sword action icon
You should still be a safe distance away and the snake should not attack
Practice your fighting moves press amp hold Spacebar until D rsquo kor assumes a fighting stance
The sword action icon must be present to do this While holding Spacebar tap quickly on the up arrow key to hit
Got it
Okay face the snake amp advance slowly toward it inching a little at a time until the snake starts to shake amp advance toward you
Stop amp hold the spacebar
Start tapping the up arrow key amp a couple of hits should kill him
If you get hurt badly reload amp try again
You can usually defeat the snakes without being hurt at all
Once he rsquo s dead walk down the corridor the snake was guarding
You rsquo ll get a cut scene with Jim
We have to keep an eye out for Jim rsquo s trapping basket
Turn around a walk in a few steps
You should get an arm action icon
Press Enter to pick up the darts for shooting bugs
Walk back to the dead tunnel snake and take the other path
Walk down the path until you see another tunnel snake blocking a path to the front and an opening to the left
Again the choice to fight or avoid
I prefer to clear out an area of enemies amp then explore freely without fear so for this WT I rsquo m killing it now
Follow the same procedure as the last fight
Save before you attack just incase
Your strength should increase once you kill him
Skip the path on the left for now amp head down the corridor he was guarding
Be careful
There rsquo s more tunnel snakes to kill amp they do walk around
Explore this lower area fully killing both tunnel snakes amp gathering any herbs you find
You should also grab that Tunnel Snake Egg
Notice there rsquo s another one of those beetle bugs here
This one rsquo s brown
Catch it
Save here before trying incase you use too many darts
Catching Trundlebugs Equip the small crossbow in inventory by highlighting it with the gold bracket cursor amp press Enter
It should show up in the gold circle
Exit inventory
Run around until you find the bug amp are close by it amp facing it
Press Enter to get the cross hair view of the crossbow
You rsquo ll have to be quick as the bug moves faster than the cross hairs move
Use the arrow keys to center the bug in the cross hairs and press Spacebar to shoot
This make take a few attempts
Once you shoot the bug it will turn belly up amp you can then walk over amp pick it up
It will be kept in the glass jar
You can only carry one bug at a time so we need to give this to Jillan as soon as we can so we can get the next bug
When you rsquo re done bug catching head back up the ramp and take the first right
At the ledge you should get a running man action icon
Press Spacebar to jump onto a rock pillar in front of you Don rsquo t worry
You can rsquo t fall off
Walk forward on the pillar until you get the next jump action icon amp press Spacebar
Continue jumping across the pillars to the other side and into the cave
Follow this cave up and you rsquo ll encounter another tunnel snake
Kill it as you rsquo ve done already
Be sure to save before attacking
If the camera angle is weird amp you can rsquo t see the opponent press the right left arrow keys to circle around into view
After the snake is dead you can see a small light brown box on a ledge in the back of the cave
Walk toward the box above amp under the ledge to a lighter grey boulder
Approach and you rsquo ll get a push action icon
Press Spacebar amp you rsquo ll try to move it
Seems as if we rsquo re still too weak
Make note of this place to return later when we rsquo re stronger
Walk back to the dead snake
Facing the cave entrance you came through hug the wall to the left
You rsquo ll smack into a boulder and get a jump action icon
Press Spacebar to climb up
Again a bunch of pillars to jump
Keep moving forward pressing Spacebar to climb to the top ledge
Pick up the trapping basket
Jump your way back down
At this point take a look at your strength in inventory
Each jump climb gives you strength points
If you rsquo re close to achieving the next level you can play around on these pillars to level up
You can literally max out your strength here but it would take some time amp be incredibly boring
I jumped the pillars one extra time amp brought my strength up to lvl
Still not strong enough to move that darn boulder
Darn
Head toward the other cave exit the one with the greenish glow
There rsquo s another snake to kill here so save first
Dispatch it amp continue forward
You should spot Jim down the path
As you head toward him you rsquo ll get an eye action icon as you pass some boulders on the right
Press Spacebar amp it will tell you they are loose
Continue forward toward the crying Jim
Just as you get near him a door comes crashing down blocking your way
Turn around and walk back to the loose boulders
The door raises again
Walk to Jim and it closes again
Hmmm must be a pressure plate here
Equip the hammer in inventory amp press Enter by the boulders
You rsquo ll hit the rocks with your hammer
The rocks fall amp one large round rock is on the left
Walk over to the large rock amp press Enter when you get the push action icon
The rock will roll down amp prevent the door from closing when you near Jim
Now we can reach Jim
Walk to the door amp press Spacebar to crawl under the door
The rock breaks and the door crashes down behind you
Talk to Jim
Looks like we need to find another way out
Walk to the mining cart and press Spacebar to find it rsquo s rusted and stuck
If you push from the back it rsquo s stuck
If you push from the side closest to Jim the lever is rusted shut
Hit Enter to use your hammer on the lever
Oops
Broke the hammer
Walk to the back of the cart amp push
It will follow the track down amp bust through the wall marked ldquo DANGER rdquo on the Lower Level Weyr Hall map
A cut scene will ensue
Jim rsquo s mom amp dad will whisk him away and thank you with a Reputation increase
Checking stats in inventory you should be at level in all
Weyr Hall Lower Level LL The bald guy in front of you is the missing meeting member
Talk to L rsquo tul He rsquo s off to the meeting
We have them all
Before we leave the Weyrbowl let rsquo s go give the bug we caught to Jillan
Head downstairs amp out into the bowl
Weyr Hall Weyrbowl Lower Level LL This time head toward the right
You rsquo ll see a ramp going up the wall leave it for now or explore it to find yet another rock you rsquo re not strong enough to move
Keep going and you rsquo ll bump into J rsquo cob
Talk to J rsquo cob
He rsquo ll teach you about the Dragon button or D key and it rsquo s function if you haven rsquo t already figured it out
You can check out the functions now but you can rsquo t leave on your dragon yet
Walk toward the little bridge past J rsquo cob and pick up the herbs to the left and right
Cross the bridge and head to Jillan at the big arch
Give him the bug and he rsquo ll give you back the empty jar to catch another as well as a Reputation increase
of done
While we rsquo re here let rsquo s go tell Hal the bad news about his hammer
Run to the cart amp talk to Hal
He rsquo ll take his hammer parts and leave
Tip from George Sarosky aka Buzman Buzman kept the broken hammer
He was able to get the hammer repaired later at Mastersmith Hall by talking to Klor amp then returned it to Hal
I am unable to trigger this after a gazillion attempts
Every time I talk to Klor he just complains about Govan
Repairing the hammer could be worth more Rep points but it you don rsquo t need them to complete the game
Head back toward the exit to the Lower Levels but don rsquo t exit
When facing the exit to the right is a much larger cave opening
Enter there to the Hatching Grounds
Hatching Grounds Walk in to see the gold dragon Morath sleeping and Syllia near her head
Talk to Syllia and she rsquo ll give you a fire lizard egg
We can hatch it if we rsquo re ldquo knowledgeable rdquo Checking our Knowledge in inventory we are at lvl and able to do it
Before we go walk past Syllia to the back of the cave
You rsquo ll see a ramp up
Head up to find Ramalla
This is where the potential Weyrwomen candidates go when we find them
You can talk to Ramalla if you rsquo d like to
Continue forward down the other side of the ramp and exit the Hatching Grounds
Head right and exit the Weyrbowl to the Lower Level
Take the stairs up to the Middle Level
Weyr Hall Middle Level ML Walk forward and to the left until you see Emmara working on the tapestry
Our reputation is high enough so let rsquo s chat with her again
She rsquo ll give us the quest to help her create the tapestry by answering questions about the worlds so she can record it
Talk to her again and she rsquo ll ask about the Dark Caves
Answer Tunnel Snakes for a Reputation increase
We have to check in with her from time to time and see if there rsquo s new questions to answer
For now we rsquo re done here
Let rsquo s head up to the Kitchen rsquo s area amp catch that bug in Stores
Head there now
Stores Arm your crossbow amp capture the black beetle just as you did the bug in the Dark Caves
Again it might take a few tries
Save before attempting
After you capture the bug leave the Stores amp visit the Kitchen again
Kitchen Talk to Roma amp deliver the stingredient for the recipe a tunnel snake egg
We rsquo ll need more of these
Before we attend the meeting on the Upper Level let rsquo s drop off this bug to Jillan
Go back downstairs to the Middle Level amp down the other stairs to the Lower Level
Exit to the Weyrbowl
Weyr Hall Weyrbowl Lower Level LL Run across the bowl to Jillan either way will get you there
Talk to Jillan to give him the bug amp get your empty jar back
Another Reputation increase

Ramp Rock Facing the exit there rsquo s a ramp up to your left
Climb the ramp to the top amp find a large rock blocking a cave
Push the rock by pressing Spacebar when you get the action icon
Enter the cave and pick up an Ancient Artefact and some more bug darts
If you can rsquo t see them don rsquo t worry
Just walk around the cave amp when you get the action icon press Spacebar to pick an item up

Nothing else in here so exit the cave amp head down the ramp
Now we can leave the Weyrbowl and head upstairs to the Middle Level
Weyr Hall Middle Level ML Assuming you made it up here without directions

If a long cut scene doesn rsquo t start then you rsquo ve encountered a minor bug
I had the bug
Someone will still be missing from the meeting
Walk around the table amp take attendance
You may need to press the ins key to cycle the cursor through the available people
Once you figure out who rsquo s missing run to their room amp talk to them again
That usually sets things running again
If you rsquo re lucky the meeting should start amp you should not have to go fetch anyone
So now we rsquo re to head to Fort Hold with K rsquo tan to deliver news of Nalaya rsquo s death to Lord Gralt
Lytah reports Nalaya rsquo s death to be suspicious
We also report the ore shortage to S rsquo bor
D rsquo kor rsquo s Room We regain control in D rsquo kor rsquo s room
Walk over to the fireplace
Open inventory and highlight the two fire lizard eggs in the lower right box
They are pinkish
Press Spacebar when standing in front of the fire to place the eggs in the sand tray to hatch them
Two new fire dragons will hatch and fly to the perch to the left
You rsquo ll collect more eggs and hatch them as the game progresses
Now you can pick a new little dragon to replace your current green one if you rsquo d like but it makes no difference which color you pick just a pretty feature
Press ins if you rsquo re having trouble picking and the wrong color keeps being chosen to cycle through the choices
Just watch who the current dragon is flying over amp press Spacebar when it rsquo s over the right one
Once you rsquo ve made your color choice let rsquo s head out
Exit D rsquo kor rsquo s room and another cut scene occurs
V rsquo hul brings you a note from S rsquo bor and asks you to deliver it to Lamrat at Ft

Tell Zenth you rsquo re ready to leave
Arrow to highlight the place you want to go and press Spacebar
Choose ldquo Ft Hold rdquo
A long cut scene occurs where you fly your dragon through a portal ldquo Between rdquo and to your chosen destination
A little disappointing eh
I was hoping to actually fly the dragon not watch it
Fort Hold Courtyard You arrive in the large courtyard surrounded by vendor stalls set up for The Gather
K rsquo tan tells you he rsquo s going to see Lord Gralt and you should search for potential Weyrwomen
There rsquo s a large arched doorway ahead and what looks like someone selling bread or pies to the right of the door
We rsquo ll start there amp work our way around clockwise
Arrie rsquo s Food Stall Talk to Arrie
She rsquo ll tell you of a thief in the courtyard market
She rsquo s afraid we wont be able to catch the thief because our current outfits clearly distinguish us as Dragonriders
The thief will surely avoid us dressed like this
Borl rsquo s Bar Stall Head to the right and talk to Maloren and Taolousien sitting on the benches near the bar stall
The drunken miners will tell you of secret caves beneath the Hold and give you a map
They rsquo ll also give you a Knowledge increase
Press TAB to view the new map
Talk to Borl behind the bar and order a drink
He rsquo ll tell you a little about the drunken miners
Another patron or two might stop in Perella amp or Archen while you rsquo re there or you might encounter them elsewhere in the Courtyard
You can talk to them but they aren rsquo t useful
Continue to the right to the next stall
Skarn rsquo s Tapestry Stall Talk to Skarn
Offer to deliver the tapestry to Salyn the Headwoman at Harperhall
Take the tapestry and continue on to the right
You rsquo ll next encounter Faran with a broken cart
During this time a little girl Keela will come by the cart amp steal candy
Faran will chase her away
This sequence is repeated until you talk to both of them
I spoke with Keela first by waiting until she stole the candy amp ran off
Follow Keela and talk to her
She rsquo ll tell you about Daize her best friend who rsquo s grumpy because she lost her toy
She rsquo ll also ask you if she can touch Zenth
Be nice and let her
She rsquo ll give you the candy she stole and a Reputation boost
Now go talk to poor Faran with the broken cart
Speaking with Faran will prompt the quest to find him a wheel bracket and a new herdbeast
You have to help him otherwise you rsquo ll never get through the door he rsquo s blocking
Accept his quest for a Reputation boost
Continue on to the next stall to the right
Parlan amp Archen rsquo s Clothing Stall Talk to Parlan or Archer whomever is there and he rsquo ll offer you some boots or clothes depending on who you talk to
Take them
Wait for the other one to walk over sometimes he rsquo s at the bar Parlan and Archen take turns going to the bar while the other works the clothing stall and talk to him
It may take a little time for him to come over
He walks between the bar amp the clothing stall so just wait amp he rsquo ll come He rsquo ll offer you the other half of your outfit
Take it
He rsquo ll only offer them to you here not at the bar
You now have a full set of civilian clothes
Keep your Dragonrider outfit on for the time being
Head to the right again along the wall
Note the crates in the corner
The next person you rsquo ll encounter is Lamrat guarding a large arched entrance
A cut scene occurs and you deliver the note from S rsquo bor
Lamrat tells you to catch the thief if you want access inside the Hold he rsquo s guarding
He also suggests Harperhall as a means of gathering information
Save your game here
You rsquo ve never had to change clothes before because you automatically put on take off your riding gear
Enter inventory amp highlight the rdoutfit
Press Enter amp you rsquo ll change into it
Nice hood
I can barely recognize you You are now ldquo undercover rdquo and are a target for the thief
He will rob you eventually but it rsquo s random as to when where within the Courtyard amp it rsquo s pretty quick so you rsquo ve got to be watching for the text message that he stole your knife
Just keep exploring amp following the WT until you are robbed then come back to this next section
ROBBED Once you are robbed you must catch and confront the thief
Run to the crates in the corner to the left of Lamrat
He stinks at hide and go seek and you rsquo ll spot him easily
Run over amp talk to Natty the thief
He rsquo ll return your knife and give you a map of The Gather courtyard market amp indoor Hall
He rsquo ll also teach you the Sneak Skill
Practice the skill as it can be hard to get into sneak mode here if you follow Natty rsquo s directions
He fails to mention that because you rsquo re in run mode you also need to hold down the L Shift key while pressing Spacebar action and use the directional arrows to move
See Bugs Tips for more info
Once you sneak out of bounds of the crates Natty will leave and you rsquo ve got a new skill in inventory
You can only sneak when that hooded action icon appears
We can try to sneak past Lamrat but let rsquo s finish exploring out here first
Joliad rsquo s Pottery Stall Head to the right of Lamrat amp meet Joliad the potter
Cranky guy
A check of the journal shows he needs a new bracket for his potter rsquo s wheel
What is with the wheel brackets in this land
Sheesh
Head right again to the next stall
Derna rsquo s Trinket Stall Derna has a few interesting items
A mining bracelet that costs marks
Darn we rsquo re broke
Perhaps later we can buy it
Ask about the top and she rsquo ll give it to you
Nice lady
Done here so continue to the right
That was the last of the vendor stalls
You come to a large arch with double doors
Looks like one is open
Enter it
Fort Hold Fountain Square Sytra is nearby sweeping
Talk to her if you rsquo d like
Walk to the right and find Ollerth Carrick and Stephe standing around drinking
Talk to any of them to start a cut scene
Ollerth needs Llama Hair
Whatever for
Best not to think about it
They rsquo ve nothing further to say so talk to the family seated on the bench by the fountain
This triggers a cut scene
Ah so this is Daize Keela rsquo s friend
They will tell you where to look for the missing toy dragon
Save game here
Behind the family is the Archery Contest
Mantaran Huwell amp Jolliffe are competing
Neelet is running the show
Talk to Neelet and enter the contest
When it rsquo s your turn you rsquo ll automatically walk up to the shooting line
Shoot the target just like you rsquo ve done the bugs
You must get ldquo Yellow rdquo to win
If you don rsquo t try again
Reload the save if you miss too many times amp run low on darts
Once you hit ldquo Yellow rdquo you rsquo ll win mark
You can only win once so move on back to the fountain once you do
Back at the fountain on another bench you rsquo ll see Skjald a harp player
Talk to Skjald and he rsquo ll relocate to the Courtyard market to annoy the potter
This increases your Reputation oddly enough
Walk to the caravan trailer just past the fountain and talk to Manwor
He rsquo ll tell you of a land called Ista and an illness affecting people and cattle
Next to Manwor is an animal pen
Harlat is in front of it
Talk to Harlat
We need a herdbeast for Faran rsquo s cart
He wants a baby tunnel snake alive in even exchange
Maybe Jim back at Weyr can help
Okay we rsquo ve talked to everyone here
Just one thing left to do before we leave the Fountain Square
There rsquo s one of those Trundlebugs here
A blue one
Shoot it with the crossbow amp capture it
Once you rsquo ve got it you can leave the Fountain Square back to the Courtyard via the doors you came in
Fort Hold Courtyard A cut scene ensues between the harp player and the potter
Run forward past Derna to the benches between Derna rsquo s stall and the potter rsquo s Talk to Skjald the harp player
Walk over to the potter rsquo s stall Joliad rsquo s Pottery Stall Take the pottery wheel by pressing Spacebar when you get the action icon
Nothing else to do around here so let rsquo s try to sneak past Lamrat
Run over behind the crates to the left of Lamrat to get the sneak action icon
Remember to hold down L Shift and Spacebar to enter sneak mode
Walk to the edge of the crates near the stairs
Wait until Lamrat goes over to Keela playing ball
Sneak up the stairs and down the corridor until it cuts to the interior of the Grand Hall
If you get caught no biggie
Try again as many times as you need
Start as close as you can to the stairs without catching Lamrat rsquo s attention
You rsquo ll have to do it quickly as I believe this part is timed
Lamrat will eventually stop talking to Keela amp return to his post on the stairs
Fort Hold Grand Hall Once inside walk down the blue pillared hall to the Stages Area
If you rsquo re stuck in sneak mode hold L Shift and the up arrow to run forward
That will turn sneak off
You may encounter Lyntikka busy changing light bulbs sorry glowlamps you can talk to her but she rsquo s not helpful
She moves about so don rsquo t worry if you don rsquo t see her now
You will next time you walk this corridor
Stages Area Walk straight ahead into the large room amp you rsquo ll a wooden stage being built
Janeth is standing in front of the ststage
Talk to Janeth
He rsquo ll say he rsquo s lost his bag of nails
Good thing he rsquo s not using wheel brackets
Walk around to the right hugging the stage amp see Tolwin hammering at the stairs
Talk to Tolwin amp he rsquo ll walk away leaving a bag of nails
Pick the bag up and bring it back to Janeth
Talk to Janeth amp he rsquo ll take the bag amp give you Mark gold in return as well as a Reputation increase
From the stage walk right amp you should bump into Larin the sculptor
He rsquo s standing in front of a large statue
Talk to Larin
He needs help uncovering the statues in here
There rsquo s to uncover around the perimeter of the large room
From Larin head right back toward the entrance
Follow the wall around keeping it on D rsquo kor rsquo s left
You rsquo ll next see men blocking a doorway
Talk to Grathol and Fandel
They will start arguing in a cut scene
This is Lord Gralt rsquo s room and we rsquo re not getting in here at the moment
Continue right following the wall
You should next see in the distance what looks like a giant white Xmas tree or a teepee
That rsquo s a statue covered in a tarp
Boy they must use a lot of starch
Walk close to it VERY close until you get an action icon
Press Spacebar to pull the tarp off the statue
to go
Continue right keeping the wall on D rsquo kor rsquo s left toward the exit
Step into the pillared hall with the glowlamps a few feet to trigger a cut scene with Lamrat
He rsquo ll tell you he needs you to find the cure to an illness
The cure is found deep within the caves beneath the Hold
Accept his quest
We need to find something to light our way in the dark caves
That mining bracelet Derna was selling will do the trick but we don rsquo t have enough Marks yet
Let rsquo s finish exploring the Grand Hall
Turn around and walk back into the large room
Head left following the wall
You may encounter Narska sweeping
Talk to her if you want
You should spot the next covered statue
Remove the tarp like you did the last
Remember you may have to getreallyclose to get the action icon
Turn to put the wall on D rsquo kor rsquo s left again amp continue forward along the wall
You rsquo ll see a door but it rsquo s decoration only
Walk past it to the next statue to uncover
Pull off the tarp
Put the wall on D rsquo kor rsquo s left side again amp continue forward
You rsquo ll next see another purely decorative door
Pass it to the next statue
Purvis is also there admiring a tapestry
Talk to him if you rsquo d like
Pull the tarp off the statue
Turn so the wall is on D rsquo kor rsquo s left again amp continue forward around the corner to an area with a bunch of tables
The nearest door is another one of those unfunctional pretty doors

Fort Hold Courtyard Okay other than now being able to enter the cave for Lamrat we rsquo re stuck here unable to fulfill quests
Let rsquo s call Zenth press D to travel somewhere new
Highlight Mastersmith Hall and press Spacebar
Mastersmith Hall After the hour cut scene yawn you arrive at Mastersmith Hall facing a building a river with water wheels turning and a little bridge
Run forward amp cross the bridge
Continue forward until the camera angle changes
There rsquo s a big concrete block in front of you and a fork in the path around it
Head right and go around the corner of the building
There will be a large doorway immediately to D rsquo kor rsquo s right
Enter the door to the Workshops
Workshops Talk to Govan
Another ldquo grumpy gus rdquo
Wonder if he rsquo s related to Jolian
Walk forward behind Govan amp then slightly left to meet Forn
Forn is your weapons connection
He rsquo ll tell you he rsquo ll upgrade your weapon in exchange for the Artefact you rsquo re carrying
Take the upgrade the Artefacts are otherwise useless not that the upgrades are anything but gold stars
They rsquo re prettier
I noticed no difference in killing
Probably just another side quest
Every time you get an Artefact bring it to Forn for another gold star I mean upgrade
Walk to the left past Forn to meet Klor
He rsquo ll fix Joliad rsquo s wheel remove the wheel bracket amp replace it with a new one
He lets you keep the old one too for Faran
Talk to Klor again for further discussion of that sweetie Govan
Exit the workshop outside
Back outside you see what looks like another doorway to the left
Go forward past the doorway
You can rsquo t enter it rsquo s just an ore bin
There are more ore bins you can rsquo t enter here
You rsquo ll also find Guy walking around here
Talk to him when you see him
He rsquo s lost his pickaxe
Guess we rsquo ll be keeping an eye out
Keep walking forward between the last ore bin amp a grey boulder until the camera angle changes
Then take a right into the cluster of rocks
In this group of rocks you rsquo ll find Guy rsquo s pickaxe
Walk back around the rocks amp talk to Guy again
You rsquo ll give back his axe amp he rsquo ll give you a Reputation increase
He also gives you a sword
Finally a real weapon
Too bad we rsquo d put an eye out if we tried to use it
We need to find someone to teach us the sword skill
Guy mentioned traders and there rsquo s a lot at Ft
Hold for the gather
Walk between the last ore bin amp the grey boulder again only this time go left
Run to the Windmill
Windmill Talk to the Miller
He may be around the side near yet another stuck lever
I wonder if the same company that makes wheel brackets in this land also dabbles in windmills
Walk to the lever and press Spacebar to learn we have to be ldquo formidable rdquo before we can budge it
The Miller also mentioned he needs new sails
The next building left of the windmill is the Masterminer rsquo s Area
Hug the wall of this building left to find the door which is locked
The bronze key doesn rsquo t work here
Guess we rsquo ll have to come back later
Turn around and follow the edge of the adjacent building
You rsquo ll encounter Rillat amp Nisan
They rsquo ll talk more about that ore problem and teach you the Mining Skill
Look for weird colored walls amp cracks from now on
The miners will get off the cart and get back to work
Leaning on the cart is a spare pick axe
Take it
There rsquo s a caravan trailer nearby but it rsquo s only decoration
Walk past the miners amp turn right curving behind the ore bins the miners are working near
Follow the dirt path to the right
It dead ends behind the Masterminer Area building
There rsquo s an herb on the ground to the right
Pick it up
Turn around and follow the dirt path back
It will merge with another path and ahead you can see a small bridge
Cross the bridge and follow the dirt path around a to a pond
Before the path ends at the pond there rsquo s another herb on the ground to the left
Pick it up
The Pond Walk into the pond
Stop in the middle
There rsquo s some small white things sliding around in the pond
They look somewhat like Trundlebugs but are oysters
Pearls come in oysters
Eureka
We can get a pearl for Lytah here
Maybe
Save your game here
Equip the crossbow and shoot an oyster much like you do the bugs
These guys are quick so reload the save if you miss too much or run low on darts
Not every oyster has contains a pearl but you rsquo ll get an ldquo edible oyster rdquo out of it if it doesn rsquo t You can eat them to replenish your health
I saved after each oyster kill to conserve darts
I found a pearl in the nd oyster I shot but it rsquo s random
The next time it was the thoyster
If you kill all the oysters and are still pearl less don rsquo t worry
There rsquo s another area later in the game that also has oysters amp you rsquo ll get a pearl there
I found if I stood in the middle amp faced the path many oysters used this area to stop for several seconds and we rsquo re easier to hit
Just look around for where a lot of them stop to change direction amp aim there
One or several will come into view
Take your time
It rsquo s frustrating
Once you rsquo re done either killing all the oysters or have a pearl call Zenth Press D and travel to Fort Weyr
Fort Weyr Weyrbowl Lower Level LL After the familiar cut scene you arrive back in the Weyr bowl
We rsquo ve a few things to do here at Weyr
First let rsquo s give Jillan this Trundlebug
Zenth drops you near the Hatching Grounds so run over to the far side amp talk to Jillan
He rsquo ll empty the jar amp give you a Reputation increase
While we rsquo re here let rsquo s go see if we rsquo re strong enough to move that rock in the Dark Cave
Follow the rock wall to the right of Jillan over to the boarded entrance you broke earlier
Enter the cave
Dark Caves Walk down the path
There rsquo s a path forward and the path to the right that you broke down earlier
Both are dead ends
Opposite of the path on the right is one of those cracks the miners told you about
So walk even with the path on the right amp turn left
You rsquo ll get a close up amp and an action icon on the wall
Equip the pick axe it rsquo s under ldquo usable rdquo items and press Enter to break down the wall
Walk inside amp pick up the ldquo Medicinal Brew rdquo
This is just a healing potion
Take it if your health gets really low
Leave the cave back to the Weyrbowl the same way you came in
Before we go indoors run around to the cottage area
Right in front of the bridge to the Windmill you rsquo ll find Helan playing
Talk to Helan
She rsquo ll say she rsquo s got something amp she rsquo ll only give it to someone ldquo Dependable rdquo
Checking stats in inventory we see that she wants level in Reputation
We rsquo re only lvl so we rsquo ll have to come back later
Exit the Weyrbowl to the LL
Weyr Hall Lower Level LL Head up the first set of stairs up do not go up to the ML
Instead take a left on the landing to the place marked ldquo DANGER rdquo on the map
Enter the Dark Caves the back way
Dark Caves Walk up the corridor and find Gethen
Talk to Gethen then head up through the doorway he rsquo s working on
Walk up the path amp you rsquo ll come to another oddly colored wall on your left
It rsquo s past the boulders you knocked down to block the door
Equip the pick axe and knock it down
Walk inside and pick up a tunnel snake egg
It rsquo s a little dark in these caves
Let rsquo s try out our Mining Bracelet
Equip it in inventory amp press Enter to turn it on off
Ah that rsquo s better
Save your game here
There rsquo s a tunnel snake just ahead so let rsquo s equip the knife not the sword
now and continue up the path with caution
As soon as you get the action icon hold down Spacebar amp start swinging
You may need to inch forward a little until it attacks
Kill it and SAVE
There rsquo s another snake just ahead
Proceed forward into the room with the rock we need to push amp kill the snake
Okay check your Strength lvl in inventory
We need a lvl to push the boulder
We rsquo re lvl
We came in through the greenish glowing entrance this time so exit the other cave entrance to some rock pillars
Jump across the rock pillars to the other side
Just out the door and to the left is another tunnel snake so be ready
Walk out amp kill it
SAVE
Continue down the path to the left he was guarding
Be careful there rsquo s more snakes down here
Find and kill the snakes
There rsquo s also an herb along the wall to pick up
Exit this area the same way you came and pass the opening to the pillars on your right
Continue up the path forward
There rsquo s one more snake to kill to the right
Walk right amp kill it then turn around and head back to the pillars because this area is all dead ends
Jump back across the pillars and into the cave
Enter the room with the rock amp the other greenish glowing entrance
Go to the back of this room amp push the rock amp pick up the Ancient Artefact
Walk back out amp exit the room through the greenish glowing door

Doesn rsquo t matter which you enter they both lead to the same place
Pick one amp walk in
Infirmary Stockroom Take a look around you rsquo ll find a lot of action icons near shelves
Most of the shelves actually contain nothing but if Sygull is in here you rsquo re not going to find out
This is a silly timed puzzle
The hassle is not worth the reward amp you can skip it without problem which is what I suggest
If you try to look at any of the shelves when she rsquo s in the room she rsquo ll ask you to go away amp you wont see the shelf contents
Sygull walks in the North door amp makes the same repeated stops then exits the South door
While she rsquo s walking around again to the North door through the Infirmary is the time to check shelves
You can check them all if you wish but only one contains a measly ldquo medicinal brew rdquo
You want to know which shelf
Ha
Ok ok I rsquo ll cut you a break

On the rdledge is a Wherry and it flies
It will attack you once you rsquo re on the ndledge
Kill it as you rsquo ve done the snakes
Climb up the ledge into the cave
SAVE
Walk down the long corridor
It will make a right curve and around that bend is another snake
The camera angle didn rsquo t change for me amp I couldn rsquo t see it
I held down space amp tapped away at the up arrow when I got the action icon and got notice it was dead
Blind fighting is a little scary
SAVE so we don rsquo t have to do that again
If you rsquo re having trouble with killing it try running past the snake until the camera angle changes then turn around amp tackle him
Keep walking and you rsquo ll come to another stone bridge
On the other side you can see a snake waiting
There rsquo s also a cave opening to the left but we can rsquo t get there from here
Walk over the bridge amp kill the snake
SAVE
From here the path forks left amp right
Take the path up to the right
It curves around heading up and around one of the bends hides another snake
Kill it SAVE amp continue up to the cave opening
Nothing here so head back down and take a right at the fork
There rsquo s another snake to kill around here so be ready as you round each bend
Continue up the cave opening after killing the snake and saving
Once you walk out the mouth of the cave a Wherry will attack from a ledge to your right
Kill it amp save

Pick up the herb
Climb the ledge to the right and then one more to another cave opening
There rsquo s a snake just ahead
Kill it amp save

SAVE
Make sure your sword is equipped amp head to the beach
After you pass the stables Holin amp his men will attack you
You rsquo ll have to beat all of them
This is the most difficult fight so far
Just tackle one at a time as they attack you
It will do no good to attack them if they aren rsquo t in fight mode toward you
Take potions or herbs as you need them amp try not to panic getting to them
Once you rsquo re in inventory they don rsquo t hurt you but they keep trying
Once you defeat them a cut scene will occur where you lose the fight amp Zenth comes to your rescue
You rsquo re probably beat up so take some healing items amp head to the beach

Exit the beach back to town
Ista Hold Go all the way up to Roem rsquo s house again
Roem rsquo s House Talk to them both amp Roem goes off to become a Weyrwoman candidate
Another found
Exit back down to the beach
Ista Beach Okay we can rsquo t do anything else here until we play dice with Fillian
We need help to win
We last saw B rsquo rak at Fort Hold playing with dice in the courtyard
Perhaps he can assist us
Let rsquo s also drop by Weyr and clear up a few things
Call Zenth and head to Ft Weyr first
Fort Weyr Weyrbowl LL Run toward the little cottage over the bridge
Just in front of the bridge to the windmill Helan is playing on the ground
Talk to her amp she rsquo ll give you an Artefact now that our Rep level is high enough

He rsquo ll teach you to use Holin rsquo s dice
Don rsquo t worry about the rules they rsquo ll be written in your journal for review later
He rsquo ll also allow you to trade in items for Marks gold
You can only sell things in inventory unnecessary to the main plot
Sell the pipe the drum the tapestry the drum pattern both lsquo strangely textured skins rsquo amp the fresh fruit
He rsquo ll also give you marks for the Artefact but you wont get the weapon upgrade
Your choice
I kept it
Call Zenth amp go to Ista Island
Ista Beach Run over to Matrice and the fishermen
SAVE
Check your journal for the rules of the game
We can make bets for or Marks each
We can rsquo t win times in a row so we have to be sure to throw a loss after every wins
What I did was mark bet roll high win mark bet roll high win mark bet roll low lose repeat
There will be times where you rsquo ll lose even if you try to win just restart the sequence
Reload if you lose too many Marks
Just keep it up amp when you accumulate over Marks the game will end amp you win
Once you win he rsquo ll give you info on the old cove where N rsquo eth might be hidden
Talk to Matrice
She rsquo ll tell you of secret tunnels in the city leading to the cove
She rsquo ll also tell us to check up in town about the recent strangers visiting Ista
Head up to town
Ista Hold Go to Kallior rsquo s door the guy who says ldquo Go Away rdquo where you had your first fight with Holin and the door opposite will open
Sorian will call you inside amp discuss the shady operations next door
You rsquo ll devise a plan for Sorian to distract the men while you sneak in
SAVE
Exit Sorian rsquo s house amp he rsquo ll follow
Enter the alley left of Kallior rsquo s door amp a cut scene ensues
You rsquo ll sneak in
This is a timed puzzle so hurry
You rsquo ll be inside the smugglers house amp the sneak action icon will be present
Enter sneak mode amp tip toe out to the right toward the fireplace
Next to the crates you should get an action icon
Press space amp you rsquo ll pick up the key from one of the smugglers
Once he rsquo s done talking to Sorian you can put the key in inventory amp tip toe back to the trap door in the floor you passed
Equip the Smuggler rsquo s Key amp use it on the trap door
You need to have the eye action icon present at the trapdoor to do so
If you get caught you rsquo ll get beat up amp tossed outside amp will have to do it over
Just reload so you rsquo re not hurt
After you open the trapdoor amp get another cut scene you rsquo ll regain control in Smugglers rsquo Cove
Smugglers rsquo Cove SAVE
You rsquo ll be in sneak mode which doesn rsquo t do much good now so hold down Shift while walking to turn it off
You rsquo re going to be seen by the enemy regardless so might as well be speedy
Run forward amp go right
A smuggler might spot you from the next doorway
Kill him if he does but more times than not you can just run right past him without him noticing
Skip the doorway he rsquo s at amp go to the next on the right
Walk in amp head down the loooong ramp
Halfway down there rsquo s a little house you can rsquo t enter
Turn amp take the path down further
SAVE
Enter the doorway at the bottom
Head right east
There will be doors out to the right and a path straight ahead
You can go right at any door which lead outside but all roads end up at the same place it just takes longer
You might have better luck avoiding the guards outside though
There are at least guards down here kill them if you rsquo re attacked
If you rsquo re lucky you can avoid them
SAVE amp heal after each kill
Keep going East to the end inside or out
When you can rsquo t go east anymore go left from inside if you rsquo re outside you rsquo ll have to turn left to get inside amp then go forward
Walk in amp you rsquo ll get an overhead view with paths to the left amp right
It iscrucialyou go in the door to D rsquo kor rsquo s right first or N rsquo eth dies
So go right
Jump down the large steps ignoring the egg for now amp rescue N rsquo eth who is staked out at the bottom
He rsquo ll swim to safety
Go back up the steps grabbing the egg along the way
If N rsquo eth accidently dies reload the save
Walk straight across amp enter the other cave
You rsquo ll find some sick Herdbeast amp Belan rsquo s body behind them
Search his body
You rsquo ll get a brooch amp a journal entry
Turn around amp go back to the entrance of this cave
Go right amp walk straight outside
Go straight over the bridge walkway amp you rsquo ll see some crates amp another smuggler ahead
You get the sneak icon by the crates
Enter sneak mode amp tip toe past the smuggler into the ship
Notice the symbol on the sails is the same as the brooch
Cut scene You rsquo re sailing on the ship amp Zenth is following above
You regain control inside the ship
The Clear Endeavour SAVE
There rsquo s some bug darts to pick up next to the barrel you rsquo re standing by
Grab them amp sneak around the barrels to the right
Keep going forward amp you should see a green Trundlebug
Capture it with the crossbow
Sneak toward the stairs but don rsquo t go up them
Instead turn left
On the other side of some crates is a map on the ground
Pick it up
A cabin boy will come downstairs shortly
He rsquo ll yell for Captain
Pay him to keep him quiet amp get a Rep increase
The ship will reach port via cut scene
You regain control on the dock
If the cabin boy comes down before you do everything reload
Ierna Beach LL Run past the smuggler at the end of the dock amp he rsquo ll yell to the crew to kill you
SAVE
They are all on the beach in various spots amp will attack you on sight
Fortunately they don rsquo t look around much
You can see the first from where you are amp he rsquo s alone
There are sets of men further down the beach
Take your time amp kill them all
Save after each kill amp remember to heal if you get hurt or reload
To kill the pairs with minimal damage inch your way toward the side of one man out of sight from the other amp he rsquo ll attack you with out the other noticing
Sort of like inching toward the tunnel snakes until they attack
When he rsquo s dead do the same for the other man
After you kill all men explore the beach
Grab whatever herbs you find
You rsquo ll also see a gold Trundlebug but our jar is full at the moment
We rsquo ll have to come back for this one
Along the back cliff wall is a ramp leading up
We can rsquo t call Zenth amp leave until the ship leaves so head up the ramp
Ierna Beach UL Fort Weyr Weyrbowl LL Run toward the cottage
Helan is playing on the ground near the bridge to the windmill again
Talk to her amp she rsquo ll offer you a tunnel snake egg
If you say you want it she rsquo ll say no amp run off to the Hatching Ground entrance
Go over the bridge to the windmill
Windmill Our strength is lsquo Formidable rsquo so we can now more the lever for the Miller
The hatch around the front opens amp you can pick up some bug darts
Exit the windmill area Run over to Jillan amp give him the green bug
You can go over to the Hatching Ground entrance amp talk to Helan again

Ignore them for now
Go right into the hall leading to D rsquo kor rsquo s room
Enter D rsquo kor rsquo s room
D rsquo kor rsquo s Room Place the egg in the sand tray
I encountered a bug here
The egg hatched amp I got no new dragon
At least the trip wasn rsquo t for nothing go back out to the meeting room

Talk to him amp find out both men we seek are inside
Enter V rsquo hul rsquo s room amp find only S rsquo lon rummaging through V rsquo hul rsquo s stuff
S rsquo lon suspects V rsquo hul as being a traitor
Try to exit amp S rsquo lon will ask you for help searching
Look at the table amp you rsquo ll pick up a lsquo vile of liquid rsquo amp a lsquo letter from Lamrat rsquo
Cut scene up to the UL
You rsquo ll stop S rsquo bor in time so he rsquo s not poisoned
Now it looks like you rsquo re implicated for being the delivery boy
We have days to prove our innocence
Sheesh
That rsquo s a fine ldquo Thanks for saving my life rdquo
We also need to gather the ingredients for the cure
Sure we have nothing better to do
Exit down to the ML amp then down again to the bowl
Fort Weyr Weyrbowl LL Call Zenth amp go to Mastersmith Hall
Mastersmith Hall Run over amp pick up the gravestone from Guy
You rsquo ll also get a Rep increase
Call Zenth amp go to Ista
Ista Beach Deliver the gravestone to Kilimi
She rsquo ll now head to the Hatching Grounds
Another candidate found
Go up the ramp near Kiristi to the curved building at the beach
Enter the first door
Curved Building Walk in amp down the stairs
Go around the crates amp barrels at the bottom to the area behind the stairs
You rsquo ll get a pick up action icon amp get some bug darts
Go back upstairs amp through the doorway in front of you a little to the right
In the next room on top of a large crate is a medicinal brew
You can explore the rest of the building but there rsquo s nothing else to be found
Exit the building
Ista Beach Around the other end of the curved building opposite Kiristi is another ramp leading up to the curved building
To the right of that ramp are herbs to pick up
There rsquo s a purplish herb between two rocks next to the green herb
Make sure you grab it it rsquo s the Featherfern we need for Roma
Call Zenth amp go to Ierne Island
Ierne Beach UL Zenth drops you at the upper region where you rsquo ll notice of the paths previously blocked by white cats are now open
Head down the ramp to the beach
Let rsquo s get that golden Trundlebug
Ierne Beach LL From the ramp head left
Capture the bug with the small crossbow
Head back up the ramp to the UL
Ierne Beach UL Head to the middle opening
It rsquo s the lsquo Keep Clear rsquo area on the map
Walk in amp get a pick up icon
You fall into a trap pit amp climb out the other side
Lear will ldquo greet rdquo you
You rsquo ll follow him to the lsquo Hunters rsquo Lodge rsquo
Hunters rsquo Lodge Here he rsquo ll test your sneaking abilities
He rsquo ll tell you to stick to shadowed areas to move undetected in order to get the herb
It rsquo s in the volcano area guarded by the white cats
You rsquo ll have to pass his test to continue
You rsquo ll regain control with the sneak icon present
SAVE
There rsquo s a closed cave entrance behind you
Enter sneak mode turn around amp walk toward the cave door
Sneak to the right around the rock you started next to
You rsquo ll get an overhead view
Sneak to the cliff wall next to the rock
Follow the cliff wall staying in the shadows best you can
Stay tight to the wall amp you rsquo ll walk around a large rock amp right under Lear rsquo s nose
From beneath Lear sneak straight out to the ramp up to him
You rsquo ll pass his test
He tells you to visit him once you rsquo ve got the herb
You rsquo ll also get your sneak skill enhanced
Walk up the ramp to Lear amp enter the storage room behind him
Pick up the lsquo empty glass container rsquo
Exit down the ramp amp you rsquo ll see herbs to the right of the target D rsquo kor rsquo s left
Run over amp pick them up
Press Ins on the numeric keypad to get the pick up icon
To the left if facing of the closed cave entrance you started at is an area with tanks containing some natural acid
Equip the empty glass container amp press enter there to fill it with acid
There rsquo s also some herbs back here to pick up
If you follow the wall with the acid tanks to the left you rsquo ll find the exit back to the upper cliff
Jump back across the pit amp run out to the UL of the beach
Ierna Beach UL Now all entrances are open amp none guarded by the white cats
Head to the entrance marked lsquo Beware Felines rsquo lsquo To Volcano rsquo on the map
SAVE before entering
Volcano Contrary to Lear rsquo s advice sneak doesn rsquo t work very well with the cats
I had better luck running quickly amp killing the cats one by one
There will be little glowing lsquo niches rsquo to hide in amp they will contain the sneak icon
I used the niches to hide in only
The cats walk past you with out attacking if you rsquo re in sneak mode within a niche
If you walk around in sneak you rsquo ll be too slow get caught amp have to fight
So run from niche to niche amp make sure you hit sneak when you rsquo re in the niche or you rsquo ll be spotted amp attacked in the niche
Yes they will come in after you if you rsquo re not in sneak mode
Chances are that you rsquo ll have to fight at least once probably more
Just save often every time to make it to the next niche unharmed or after every kill
Use herbs oysters amp brews as needed
F is your friend
You can also run away if you rsquo re attacked
Try not to panic amp run to another niche amp enter sneak mode
If you rsquo re quick enough the cats will go back to their patrol routes amp leave you alone
From the entrance head in amp to the right
There is only one way to go but there will be niches to hide in
There is one cat ahead
Go around the corner amp enter the blue niche
You rsquo ll get a sneak icon
Enter sneak mode amp wait for the cat to turn around in front of the niche
Follow him in a run as long as you rsquo re behind him he wont see you to the next niche which is green
Wait there in sneak mode for him to pass back the other way toward the entrance
Then run opposite to the gap in the path
You rsquo ll get an action icon to jump across
Hurry amp run into any of the niches there amp hit space to sneak
With any luck the cat there will not follow you into the niche amp eat you
Kill him if you must but try to do so from inside the niche or another cat might spot you amp run over to help
Then you rsquo ll have to deal with
If you get after you your best bet is to run for your life to another niche jump back across the gap or just reload amp try again
There are cats over here so be careful
This path curves around to the right amp also makes a loop
Around the far side there rsquo s an edge to jump down to the middle area the path curves around
This is our goal to get down there
If you find a long blue hallway like niche with an herb inside you rsquo re in the right area
It rsquo s about as far right as you can get on the path
It rsquo s where the rdcat on this path patrols
From the blue hallway niche wait until you see the cat turn around then run out amp to the right
You rsquo ll see the edge with no rocks blocking the way
You rsquo ll get the jump icon
Quickly jump down once before the rdcat attacks you
SAVE
When you jump down twice more you rsquo ll have to fight a cat so make sure you rsquo re okay on health amp have the sword equipped before you jump
Jump down amp kill the cat
After you kill it take the herb on the rock
Cut scene amp Lear will kill a cat attacking you from behind
You rsquo ll get a journal update amp follow him to the Hunters rsquo Lodge
Hunters rsquo Lodge You rsquo ll discuss the people living on the South side of the island
He rsquo ll give you a large crossbow and the skill to use it
This one rsquo s not for bugs but for people that bug you
Exit the area jump over the pit back to the upper cliff of the beach
Ierne Beach UL Call Zenth and go to Ft Weyr
Let rsquo s get rid of this Trundlebug so we rsquo ll have an empty jar just incase
Fort Weyr Weyrbowl LL Run to Jillan amp give him the bug

Zenth says it might be a good idea to meet her
She might be Weyrwoman material

NOTE
This section contains a puzzle that I chose not to do
This may or may not have resulted in the missing journal entry I have for Hellion
The puzzle involves ringing the bells on levels which calls the guards to various rooms depending on the number of strikes to the bell
This allows you to move or move prisoners undetected by the guards
I killed all the guards before I figured this out
Mine being the much easier lsquo thug solve rsquo

If anyone knows how to solve this quest amp get the journal entry on pg please email me
I also wonder about pg of the journal
It seems like a large empty space at the bottom of the page
My final entry on that page reads ldquo URGENT I must find some SWEATROOT to give to poor Roem rdquo If there rsquo s another entry I missed here please email me amp let me know
It may be because the next entry on pg is a picture amp there wasn rsquo t enough room on pg for it so we might not be missing anything
Then again we could be missing a sentence or two concerning where to find the Sweatroot
Other than these spots the journal is complete
Hope you enjoyed yourself

I think this format works well for this game
Alsonote that this was written using the Normal difficulty setting
However sincethe only difference between the difficulty settings is how much damage you take for easy for hard this shouldn't have any effect at all on theWalkthrough
Also note that I don't use the proper names for most of the creatures
Iusually call them what they look like
This is because the manual doesn'tactually list all the monsters so I had to make new names up
If you want tosee the proper names you can check down at the Enemies section below
The Beginning of the Game Ruined Village Get the Mithril Short Sword Hint Do a Quick Save simply press 'Q' after you win every Battle
Butdon't just use the Quick Save
Every once in awhile say after youdo something significant like get the Dragon Armor you should makea Safety Save that is save it normally with the intention of keepingthat save forever
This way if you find that you missed something youcan simply reload and keep going
Beats redoing a level Be careful when you first start out a Wartok will try to sneak up on you Don't forget to equip your sword
use the mouse wheel or press ' ' Go north and then east
There is a Wartok here
Go into the house to get aHealth Elixer Now go all the way west
You will see a ruined house there but don'tbother going inside
Instead go north and slide down to the beach
Alittle to the Northwest is some treasure a Mithril Short Sword and Health Elixers Now swim along a little to the west make sure to come up for air
and thengo back on shore and head south to get Duncan's Battle Axe durability Go back to where you got the Mithril Short Sword and there is a little cavejust to the south of that
Go in there
There are some Spiders in there sobe cautious
Spiders Kill them is pretty easy just crouch R CTRL and attack if they gettoo close
No strategy involved really
These enemies are weakenough that you only need to use Atimar's Blade
You will find yourself at an underground lake
Swim across it to a newsmall room that has a pool Dive into the pool and swim through to a new area Get out of the water and find the passage hard in the dark and go down it There will be some spiders here Eventually you will reach the end of the passage and then you flip thelever to get into the Tavern Basement
You start at the last step in thenext part Tavern Key
So immediately you can get the Key
Tavern Key The Tavern is just to the south of where the Man died In one of the rooms upstairs is a Life Potion On the back of the stairs open a door to the cellar Smash any barrels you find for Health Elixers Jump onto the boxes to get onto the ledge to get the Mace
Hint The sword that you start with is the only item until you get the MournBringer or Rune Blade but that will be awhile
that does not getdamaged over time all the other weapons armors etc
will
So if youdon't need to use the Mace DON'T
For example if you see a Barrel thatyou want to smash use your original Short Sword on it
Flip the lever ENTER to open the portculis Use the crouch attack on the Spiders On a table to the left from where you entered is a key use ENTER to getit
Find the Rusty Chainmail From the dead Man go West until you get to the Area with the Scavengers init
Scavenger Sneak up to it then let it come to you crouch and attack with theMace
It should only take about attacks
There is a little cave further to the west that has the Chain Mail in it durability
Hint After you get a new item like the Chain Mail armor you need to open upyour inventory press 'I' and equip it
double click it Go out of the cave and up the ledge that leads southward
There will beanother Scavenger up here Jump into the river and swim westwards until you get to where you can standup in the water then head north
There will be a Wartok here
Kill himto get the Invisibility Potion
Go into the shed or is that an outhouse
to get Health Elixers Climb up the ledge to the South West and then slide down the other side toget back to the area where we found the Chainmail From here go back to the Tavern
Priest Book Head south past the tavern to get to the Priests house Beware there is a scavenger fast bugger
along the path
Scavenger Sneak up to it then let it come to you crouch and attack with theMace
It should only take about attacks
Further along the path you will find a Wartok killing a human
Wartok Sneak up to it then attack as much as you can
Head south and cross the river Atimar's the Priests house is not the one immediately across the river his is the house just to the east of that
There is another Scavengerbetween the houses Go up to the door and use your key ENTER then enter to house The Book is just on the table inside
Find Soul Crystal As you exit there will be two Wartoks
Hint If it looks to you like a Wartok is yelling and flailing his arms aroundthat means that he is calling for his other Wartok buddies to come andhelp him kill you
Head back north across the bridge Go East there should be about Wartocks along here As the path curves go north
There will be a larger Wartok here with aPotion of Life Head north across the bridge and into the temple Use the book ENTER on the pedestal which is on the temple you must dothis while standing on the north side of the temple Step onto the steps and the Game will take over and show you someinteresting exposition Go down into the pit After you go through a little tunnel you will emerge into a room with manySwinging Axe Blades
Walk right up to each blade wait for it to go by then run past it
Careful
Each blade goes at a different speed
You maywant to save it after you pass each one
Also be careful that you stay onthe path it bends to the right then bends back sort of like a crescentmoon Walk through the tunnel into a Domed Chamber At the opposite end of the dome you will find a Statue and a Floor Switch Push the statue onto the switch Now on the two sides of the chamber are two more Floor Switches go over tothose and step on them
The lights should go out leaving only a purplishcolor in the center of the room
Also the pit in the center of the domewill be filled Go into the center of the room and get Heron's Crystal off of the front that is facing the entrance of the weird Purple thing Now the pit will reopen but now as a Staircase go down it Finally step onto the platform at the end of the tunnel and it will raiseyou to a new cave
Awaken Arokh Exit the cave and cross the suspension bridge
Your map will be updated which is what that flashing map icon means On the other side you will find a Wartok
or two Head east and then south
You should arrive at a place with a few stackedboxes and a torch
From there take the new path to the north There should be about Wartoks here on mine they appeared to have killeda fourth one
Don't attack their barrels as they are explosives Continue north to the Giant Bare Tree Thingie whatever and push it over If you are lucky it will fall on the Wartock on the other side and killhim
well that's what happened to me
Jump onto your new bridge and CAREFULLY cross it Head north
There will be another Wartok here Go into the cave there are about Wartoks in here
Go through the cave
Hint Don't try to run away from Wartoks they are much faster than you
Thisis true for most enemies they simply are faster than you
Once through the cave there is another Wartok Head east through the northern path and you'll get to see a brokensuspension bridge Careful while crossing this bridge as you may have noticed it is quitebroken There will be a Wartok immediately off of the bridge and there are severalothers camped out close by
Hint The Thrust Tap Forward Attack makes an excellent first attack againstWartoks it can remove their weapons or limbs and slightly stuns themas well
Hint If Wartoks hear something they will go out to investigate whether theyknow you are there or not
So if you stay still they may wander aroundthen head back to their camp and go back to sleep
Very useful
Thenyou can sneak up on them and attack
Go to the East Bridge and cross it you'll know it because there is askeleton skewered by it Now go north drop off the little cliff and then go up the side of themountain to the East
There is a Wartok here
Hint If you are having trouble going up a mountain side try doing a littlejump
Head east to the next bridge
There will be about Wartoks around
DoNOT attack the barrels there one of them is an explosive Cross the Bridge
Careful this bridge isn't completed either Now go North East
A Wartok here will push a boulder in an attempt to killyou but on my game he merely managed to kill another Wartok
Notice thepretty waterfall
Ooh Pretty The path we want to follow is close to the river and heads south
It'svery dark and hard to see but this path leads to another bridge Cross this bridge as well and once again there's a big hole in it
You'dthink that the people here would have taken better care of their bridges There is a Scavenger to the right after you get off the bridge Further to the West right of the bridge is a Cave and inside is anotherScavenger who has killed a man who had a Health Elixer and a Worn ChainMail
Cool Go back out of the Cave and head up and east You will soon see a Red Cave that looks very suspicious
There are quite afew Scavengers around here Walk through the little stream and over to the Cave
Go inside
Your mapwill be immediately updated to show this cave In the hallway just past the Main Hallway will be a trap near the floor Just as soon as the axe moves out of the wall and away from you run afterit
Then when you get about halfway you will need to jump because the axewill swing back out Now the hall will turn and the next hallway has such axes
One on thefloor and one higher
Get as close to it as you can get use the Sneak before making your move
After the low one has passed run out about halfwayand crouch let the one move above you then run out again and jump to getover the low one For the next hallway it is actually safe to stand in the corner of thehallway that connects to this hall NOT the corner near the Axe
Thisallows you to look and see what you need to do
This time there are again traps and again one high and one low
However this time they swing atthe same time
Again run past the first trap and then quickly crouch runon the second trap
It should pass harmlessly overhead
Then stay crouchedand do a few rolls forward to the end of the hall and a roll left to get tosafety You will now be in a weird Reddish room with blocks missing from the floor Did I mention that if you fall down into that pit you die
What you have todo is to jump across the pit to get to the other side
There are someblocks left that you can use to jump across but they will fall down if youwait too long
Once across IMMEDIATELY turn to the right and run into thecave if you wait even for a second the blocks will all fall down and youwill die Run into the next chamber but don't jump down the cliff
You will be in aroom with the statue of a large Dragon
Follow the path to the right of theentrance to the chamber to reach the bottom of the room Walk up to the Thingie in the Center of the room and watch the littlecutscene
Congratulations you now have a Dragon
Wartok Canyons Area Find the Grimstone Mines Part One You are now in a small cave leave the cave and it will be daylight andraining there will be two Wartoks out here
Hint When fighting on the back of your Dragon realize that Arokh does notautomatically move his head around as you move the mouse while Rynndoes
To move his head to hit the enemies better use the Right MouseButton
Also realize that the amount of life you have is shared soif you have a sliver of life while on the Dragon you both have a sliverof life
Finally the meter on the right is for your Dragon Flame andnaturally replenishes itself
To the south across the river is a small ruin that has a Health Elixer There will be about two Wartocks around this Go a little to the east to the small cabin there get off your Dragon andgo inside
There's a man there who managed to avoid the Wartoks and hewill get you a better sword IF you clear out a mine full of spiders whichis just a little to the south A little further east you will find three big Wartoks well technicallythis is a normal Wartok and all the smaller ones are called Orcs but sincethey are related I call them both Wartoks
and another ruin
Big Wartok Attack first with a slicing motion the normal attack works fine with your Sword
You do this to try to get rid of their weaponsor a shield if they have one
If you can try to kill them on yourDragon but realize that it will take two shots of flame to killthem
Plus they tend to run for cover when you start shooting atthem
Hint Careful
There is a Giant Cannon Thing just to the north of this area and it will start shooting at you if you get too near it
and there isyet another one to the east of that first one Check out the ruins for another Health Elixer
there is a small cave nearbywhich is the exit from the Spider Cave and no you can't go very far in it Clean Out Spider Caves Check your map to see where the Spider Cave is
It isn't all that high upon the mountain
Fly there get off of your dragon and go inside
useENTER to unlock the door Once inside just wander around and kill Spiders
You'll know there areSpiders because you can see the Reds of their eyes Walk out onto a ledge then push that big Post Thingie down and cross itlike a bridge Kill the spiders here and then head south into the dark
There will besome more spiders
And a Bow
Make sure to secure the area i e
kill allthe spiders before trying to grab the bow ENTER because you arevulnerable while you grab things
Don't forget to take the Arrows too Head east into more spider killing fun
the Spiders Nest
Hint Be very careful in this area
Just when you think there are no moreSpiders around they will drop on their Spiderline from the Ceiling tokill you
Also you can kill that weird moving thing on the wall
Continue through the cave to the south until you get to the barrels Secure the area
Smash the barrels to find two Health Elixers
Continueup the passage killing all the spiders that you find You will find yourself in a nicely lit room that is also convenientlylocated above the Nest
Move to the other end of the room to find yourselfa new Chain Mail Jump onto the low box from there to the higher box and from there to thevery convenient board with the explosive at the other end
The Explosivewill fly up and blast the ceiling killing the spiders Now head down the SE passage
There will be a set of boxes here and aledge
Jump onto the boxes to get onto the ledge
This leads to the caveby the Man's Cavern you know the guy who sent you up here
Leave thecave and go West to the man's cabin You get a Rune of Stone and an updated map
You have to use the Rune ona certain ledge to find out where the Sword is
it's to the north Get the Short Sword of Flame After coming out from the Cabin I was attacked by a Crow Dragon
Crow Dragon These nasty creatures fly around and shoot you with Green Fire Get on your Dragon quickly and blast them away
just hold downthe Attack key Crow Dragons firing range is ever so muchshorter than yours but don't let them get too close or they'llblast you away
Fly up to the ledge which should now be indicated on your map it's to thenorth in any case
Use your Rune of Stone in the center of the monolithswhere there is a little indentation for it and a cave will open up
Goinside The cave will wind its way for a little while don't worry you won't getattacked until a little later
Hint NEVER roll up to a Scavenger
Or any other enemy for that matter Scavengers will tend to swipe at you when you are still rolling
When you reach a small hallway with a torch the wall crumbles and out popsa Scavenger
Now you can go either left or right from here it doesn'treally matter as they end out in the same place in the end
Although theright passage has a trap to get by
if you take the left passage that isthe one that the Scavenger popped out of you will pass another room onyour way to the room with the Big Green Crystals In the next room there will be more Scavengers Near the Big Green Crystals will be a skeleton who just happens to have aHealth Elixer Take the passage to the West this is where the Left passage came from andgo into the little room on the right
Step on the little Plate here and aSecret Door will open Take the passage down
There will be a Scavenger here
Now you have twomore choices
There is the door that is in front of you and one thatcurves back behind you
it's to the north Take the north path
You will see a narrow path suspended over what appearsto be a bottomless pit with two giant axe traps to each side
Run down thepath to get to the Short Sword of Flame
The path will collapse behind youand the Axes will start swinging
Getting out is the fun part
Walk to theend of the ledge wait for the right moment and jump back
Hint To use the Short Sword of Flame's fire attack use the Attack Alternatebutton which is either the middle mouse button or ' ' on the numberpad
But remember that you only get of those
Also the Short Swordof Flame works well as a torch
Note When you fight Knights later on they have a similar version of theShort Sword of Flame so if you lose this one don't worry too much
Go back to where you had the two choices of where to go Go down the little passage and hop down into the room
There will a coupleScavengers in here or more
There is also a Health Elixer here if youwant it
Where you want to go are the Two Big Blocks
Use them to get upto a ledge Go down the little passage
You will find two sleeping Scavengers here sneak up to them and kill them Continue down the passage to the Cave Exit which again you can't go backup
When you exit you will find two big Wartoks here
Also Arokh will fly downfrom the high ledge
Note If you're wondering if you can go back to the Man and talk to him aboutyour newfound Sword well you can't
Sorry
Find the Grimstone Mines Part Two We're going to continue East along the River
Watch out for any Cannons Wartoks Crow Dragons along the way
Make sure to check the bodies of anyWartoks that you kill for Health Elixers When you get close to the Gate Mine well that's what it looks like on themap it will start to snow
Get off your Dragon and go towards the door It's locked and you need a key
Find Key to Troll Caves Continue all the way east
There are a lot of Crow Dragons and Cannonsalong the way so be extraordinarily careful
Go to the cave with thebanners get off Arokh and go inside There is a big Wartok with a shield near the entrance here Continue down the passage and slide down to the area with all the boxes Kill the Wartok here and try to then sneak up on the other Big Wartoks withShields
Caution
One of those Wartoks is really really Big and reallyreally tough
Try pelting him with arrows Go into their forge to pick up a Long Sword and more arrows
And alsomake sure to get the East Cave Key
Despite the name it's the key we areafter
if you can manage it you might want to get these before fightingthose Wartoks In the Big Fireplace you can also find a Mithril Long Sword Go into the next room with the barrels and flip the switch then run andjump onto the elevator to get back onto the ledge
From there you merelyhave to retrace your route out
Troll Caves Go back to the west to the Mines that we couldn't get into before
Thistime unlock the door and go inside There will be two Wartocks one large one not so much in here
Flip thelever to open the giant door to let your Dragon in Go back and get on Arokh come inside and roast any Wartoks you can find Unfortunately you can't go very far before a trap springs closing a gatethat forces you off Arokh back on foot Just past the gate is a VERY large chamber with a lake in the center andtwo Wartoks
Using your Mithril Long Sword they shouldn't present much ofa challenge Head right up to the passageway with a Steam Vent and a Cart by it
Therewill also be another Large Shielded Wartok here Go down the passage kill the small Wartok and take his Scimitar Run through the doorway and then quickly jump while you are in the darksection lest you fall into the trap Go forward into the dark then turn left and go down the ladder use theBACK command to go down ladders You should now be above a torture chamber there are wartoks down there If you want you could Sniper them with your Bow
Hint After you use arrows on anything try to find all the arrows that youshot you will be able to collect quite a few of them
On the table here is a Health Elixer The Corpse on the Rack has a Battle Axe which you can take stuck in him There is another Health Elixer by those boxes to the north of the Rack Once you're done down there use the boxes to get back up the way we cameinto the chamber and go back up the ladder From here run up a path on the other side of the passageway to get to thearea above
There will be two Wartoks here one large and one not
Killthe big one to get a Potion of Life Continue up this way until you get to where there is a Gate on the side ofthe passage and the passage still continues onward Go right into the room and further in to a nice little treasure chamber You will find a Fire Crystal and a Health Elixer on the shelf some MagicArrows and a Heavy Bow on the boxes
Nice
Note Fire Crystals and any other type of Magic Crystals are used just likeweapons
Once you use a Crystal it disappears
Note You can only equip different weapons although you can have more inyour inventory
Hint Don't use your nice Magic Arrows on normal enemies like Wartok's savethem for faster prey such as Crow Dragons
you'll see
Now that you've taken their stuff the Gate has closed and a Wartok is inthere with you
Kill it open the gate again and go Continue down the passageway again
You will come back to that largechamber with the lake but this time you are far above it
There is a verylarge and mean Wartok on this bridge
Once you get to the other side flipthe big switch to open the big gate to let in Arokh Now you have to dive into the lake careful where you dive btw go back tothe other side and go get Arokh Open up the gate with Rynn then get back on Arokh and go through
Blastthe Wartoks in here
Careful it is a tight fit Go down the corridor
Eventually you will have to fly across a smallunderground canyon Once past that continue down the canyon
You will shortly pop out into theOutside world again this time on the north end of the map
Find the Grimstone Mines Part Three There will be two Crow Dragons flying around here
As long as you don't gettoo close to them you can try to pick them off from a distance
Good luck In the ruins nearest the Cave Exit are some Arrows Go up to the ruins just to the north of the first ones to find a dying manfrom your village
He says that there is a Secret Entrance to the Minesthat can only be reached by Dragon
Your map will also be updated to showthe Secret Entrance to the North East of your current position
There isanother Crow Dragon just to the east of here
Find the Secret Entrance There's nothing at the other two ruins although there are some Wartoks nearthe Ruin to the East You can check out the Entrance to the Mine to the SW but you can't get inthat way you have to go to the Secret Entrance that we so conveniently justheard about
So go North East You can find the secret entrance on a ledge on the right side of the water fall
Land there get off Arokh and go inside
Wartok Mines Inside the Mines Just inside the entrance there will be a Spider
Hint Just use your original Short Sword on the Spiders
It's quick and itonly takes three hits to kill a spider with it
Head north along the passage there will be a little tremor don't worry itwill pass
and just after that you'll find another couple of Spiders Continue down the windy passage You will eventually after a Spider or two of course get to a large roomwith a giant contraption
Neat looking ain't it
We'll get back to itlater Continue on across the board over the ravine and from there into the nextpassage When you come to the place where you can go different ways go left thenleft again
There are bunches of spiders here so be careful
There is asmall room with a big egg sac in the center that has a Great Sword and aHealth Elixer Continue down this passage In the next room you will find some arrows and in the furthest room downyou will find a Health Elixer an Invisibility Potion and a Power Crystal Continue down the little corridor again it gets really tight in here
andthere will be another tremor
Follow this passage back out the way we cameand then go back across the Ravine Go up to the Machine again and from the side facing away from the ravineuse the Power Crystal that is walk up to the Slot and press ENTER
Themachine will make a new door for you go through it
you have to go aroundthe right side of the machine Hint Attacking Wartoks can get tricky especially when taking on the verylarge ones with the shields
First you want to use a Big Weapon theGreatsword will do nicely and remember that the timing is completelydifferent with this weapon than with your Shortsword
Now what you wantto do is to attack them from behind or while they are attacking asthat is the time when their defenses are lowered
After you have doneyour attack you want to dodge around use the Strafe side to side andbackwards motions
Another idea is to try moving Left and Right andslashing but this idea takes better timing than it would appear
There are a lot of Wartoks here From here go to the right past the boxes and the Wartoks up to the passage There will be another Wartok here a nasty guy with an Axe Just past here will be the Main Entrance and two more large Wartoks onlyone has a Shield however Flip the switch and the door will open partway
Go outside and QUICKLYcall Arokh
Very soon a Green Dragon will attack you kill it and a GiantGreen Rune of Poison will appear
Fly into it and get it
there is anifty little animation here The Door will open back up and you can takeArokh inside
Hint You can switch Dragon attacks the same way you switch Rynn's attacks Realize that the poison attack is a lingering one and doesn't disipateas quickly as a fire attack which is gone as soon as it hits
Don'tworry you can't be hurt by your own poison
Go back inside and go to the Ravine using Arokh to cross it Go down the little passageway until you get to a point where there are twoways that you could go
There will also be a Wartok here
as you movedown this passageway you will notice that it pauses and says Loading thisis because we have now entered the Mines Proper check your map it is nowthe Mines map Get off of Arokh here and go up the left path and through the door You enter just in time to see Wartoks torturing a prisoner to death
Seemsthat they are looking for the hider
Find the Hider Go down the ladder to the left
There will be two Wartoks here Flip the switch if you flip it and the door is closed go back and flip itagain to open up the door that is down from the switch
Inside you willfind a Chain Mail Worn Mace Health Elixers and a Life Potion Now go back to where you left Arokh and go down the other path whichshould now be open
A Wartok w Shield will be there waiting for you
Youcould take him by yourself or you could blast him with Arokh
Your choice Get back on Arokh and go into the new passage There will be a bunch of Wartoks here but they are no match for Arokh Continue down the passage
You will see a miner working on a lode of theGrimstone that's what those big green crystals are
He is quite insanebecause of the Grimstone and will attack you
Grimstone Miner These poor humans are so taken by the Grimstone that theywill attack you their only hope for salvation
They areslow and easy to attack
The easiest way to deal with them however is to ignore them since they won't be very quickto attack you
Turn left from the miner and continue down the passage
There is a Wartokhere A gate will close here and you'll have to leave Arokh here
Nuts
Gothrough the gate as Rynn You are now in a large mining area
Go left and then follow the pathupwards as it curves back around
There will be two Wartoks up here
Thereis also a Long Sword here and if you smash the barrels you'll find a HealthElixer Use the Switch here to open the Gate to get Arokh back At the north end of this Chamber right from the Gate is another littledoor for Rynn to go through so you didn't kepe Arokh that long
There area great many Wartoks through here so you may want to use Arokh's attacksthrough the door before you go in Head down the passage
You will reach a cliff follow the little path alongthe cliff
There will be a Wartok here There will be a suspension bridge cross it Continue along until you get to a very large chamber
There are of course many nasty Wartoks here Go to the far end of the chamber and climb up the litle path
There willbe three sleeping Wartoks here assuming you didn't already kill them Be very careful here but one of the three barrels is not an explosive Find which one it's more fat if that makes sense and smash it to reveala Fire Crystal If you want continue along the path kill the Wartok back here to get itsLife Potion Run back to the front of this Mine Thing and climb up the ladders
On thethird ladder make sure that you are on the right side of it that is theside facing the ledge Now jump across from this ledge to the next ledge careful to avoid thetraps And from this ledge jump across to the final ledge don't bother going upthat ladder Run down this little passage
Skip the room to the right unless you needa Scimitar and go into the room to the left As you enter a boulder will be pushed down towards you
Run to the littlealcove to the left and the boulder should pass you by
There is a Wartokhere
Go up to the left to the lighted area to find a large ledgeoverlooking the mining operation and a Switch
Flip it and a largeplatform will be moved up Head back out the passage to where you had to jump ledges while avoiding thebig traps
Jump across and this time go up the ladder
Hint If you want you can knock Wartoks off of ledges instead of killing themyourself
Simply get them near a ledge and attack
There is a Wartok here and a miner
Ignore them run across and jump ontothat platform that you raised and from there to the next ledge There is another Wartok here as well Run along the path and from there into the next passageway try not tofall down that bottomless pit btw When you get to the sign turn right and go down the passage At the next sign you don't want to continue going upwards through thepassage you want to go outside into the snow with the two Wartoks
but remember this place for later it's the Crushing Room sign
Run along the ledge don't fall now
and into the next room and from thereinto yet another passage There is a Wartok in here
Go through this passage It leads outside again to an area with a lot of Wartoks Find the path leading to the higher ground and from there find the doorwayto the next chamber At the far end of this chamber are two barrels
Smash them to get someArrows
Go up the ladder There is a Wartok here
From this chamber go west to the passage until youget to a left right fork in the passage Take the left passage as far as it will go
There will be a few Wartoks inhere
At the far chamber smash the barrels but avoid the Explosive hiddenin between the barrels to get a Health Elixer
Also get the Magic Arrowson the bench
There is also a long bow here if you need it Go back to the fork and take the other passage After going all the way down and killing the two Wartoks you will find quitethe little treasure trove
There is a Giant Slayer Sword Scale Mail armor Health Elixer in the barrels and an Ice Crystal Go back to the room with the ladder in it and this time take the pathwaythat leads to the East Head along this passageway until you get back outside then follow the pathalong the cliff You will make it to another passageway to go down
This leads to a darkroom
Go inside
There will be a pedestal with the Crusher Room Key on it Take the key
remember back to when we had a choice up going up a passageat a sign or going outside along a cliff well that's where we're going
Also walk up to the Treasure Chests to get them to open to get two HealthElixers Go out of the room and you will be attacked by a Knight with Two FlamingSwords
Knight He has both a regular attack with his two flaming swords and a magicFlame attack
When he brings he swords up above his head that meansmagic so get away from him quick
You can try using the Ice Crystalon him and your new sword the Giant Slayer
Once he's dead take his Flaming Sword
it has a better attack than yourShort Sword of Flame but has a much shorter Durability Now we have to get way way back to where we had the option of going outsideor following a passage upwards to the Crushing Room because now we have akey for it
it's actually not all that far back if you know where you'regoing Once back at the sign go up and fight off the two Wartoks here
Go out thenew door
There may be a Crow Dragon out here
Crow Dragon without Arokh Use your Bow and Magic Arrows they'll seek rightto your prey
Head out across the path
Careful of the Wartoks here
You want to go allthe way south and into a new passage
If you see a big green thing thatlooks like a portal avoid it
You want to take the passage that heads eastto get Arokh back Go all the way down the passage and flip the lever to open the big door Go through and pick up Arokh and bring him back
Go back out of thispassage Go to the big Gate thing in the center of the Area get off your dragon andopen the door with your new key
Go inside There are some Wartoks in here
but when are there not
There are barrels the middle one is an explosive
There are Health Elixers in thebarrels Head down the passage until you reach the Crusher
There are a couple ofWaroks here sneak up and kill them
The big Wartok should leave you a LifePotion Find the big switch and flip it to turn the Crusher on Now go to the far end of the chamber past the Crusher and up the littlepath to the ledge right by the Crusher Now jump from crusher thing to crusher thing to get to the far ledge
Youmay not get it on the first attempt but don't worry just so long as youdon't get crushed
On the last Crusher Thing you can probably just run offof it when it gets a little higher than the next ledge Go down the passage a little ways until you get to an area where you get achoice of a right path and a left path
There you will find a Scavenger Go into the little room to the right to get Health Elixers Now take that path to the left
Another Scavenger will pop out of the wallto the West
Inside its little hidey hole is a Mace of the Hand
very nicething to have Continue down the passage
There will be a section that you will have toslide down There is a really big Grimstone here that looks like flakes are falling offfrom it
Walk down a little ways and you will find the Hider
He explainsthat you have to destroy the mines by destroying the Grimstone Generator And this is ok because all the miners are insane anyway
Plus your brotherwas taken elsewhere
Destroy the Mines Go to the reverse side of the chamber by going around the cliff ledge tothe side by the Green Barrier
Jump onto the close one of those platforms Now turn the Side Crank three times so that your platform will be about onthe same level as the next platform
Now go to the Lever and pull that and QUICKLY jump onto the next platform this one is about to fall
Here you only need to pull the lever and jump to the next one On this platform you need to Turn the Crank about times then pull thelever and jump to the next platform This one is a little tricky
What we want to do is to pull the lever andthen jump down to the ledge by the Barrier which will drop when we throwthe switch
Do so Go through the Hole that the Barrier was in and run up the passage
Carefulas some boulders will fall when a tremor hits
if you stay to the left youshould be able to avoid them Continue on and across the wooden ramp From this ledge turn right and jump onto the platform and from that ontothe next ledge Run up to the highest point on this ledge it's closest to the wall andfrom there jump across to the next ledge From this ledge jump onto the path ledge to the southeast Run up this path
Another tremor will hit and another boulder will falldown
Continue onward until you exit the mines and meet back up with Arokh Now fly down that large southern passage and into that very large portal
it had been blocked by a Green barrier Hint When flying into the large portals on Arokh make sure that you arecentered on it vertically and horizontally
Otherwise you cannot getthrough
Fly a little farther and you are out
Grotto Get the Sword of Ice In this little area are about Crow Dragons
there are more if you takethat little tunnel to the west Go straight west
There are more Crow Dragons here
Fly as high as you canand you will notice a cave to the south
Fly over there and land
There isa Giant Wartok here
Giant Wartok Is a really mean bugger who likes to throw things at you
Hemight even pick YOU up if you get too close to him
or he'lljust crush you under his foot If you are lucky enough to be onArokh at the time he isn't any harder than a Cannon but onfoot he is much harder
He is almost slow enough that youcan outrun him if you have to fight him face to face
Don'tbother wasting your arrows on him as they have no effect
Useyour most powerful weapon run up to him and attack then getaway before he hits you with his very powerful attacks
Have Arokh land on the higher ledge by the small cave and send Rynn inside There will be one Giant Wartok here and an ornate entrance to another cavewhich will be put on your map Go into the cave There you will see the Sword of Ice
Careful when getting it to avoid theIce attacks eminating from it You can't go back the way we came so go down the other path that heads tothe south
There will be TWO Giant Wartoks here Go into the little cave to the West to get a Health Elixer and a Life Potionand there is also some Ice Arrows and a Long Bow Now run up that side ledge and follow it along until it puts you on aprecipice just above the cave that we came in at
Slide down and go backinto the cave Now we are going to take Arokh into that larger cave Go forward a ways then have Arokh shoot a hole in the wall there's alittle black section there and have Rynn go through There will be about Scavengers here
Continue through the passage whichnow takes a turn to the left A skeleton frozen on the wall has an Invisibility Potion
The otherskeleton here has an Ancient Long Sword durability and a Scale Mailarmor Now just slide down from this ledge and get back on Arokh and go
Find the Entrance to the Eastern Archipeligo Go back to where you started in this area Fly South and West near that big Portal
It's sealed so we have to land onthat nearby ledge and get off Arokh Go in the door
Just inside you will find a Wartok
And behind those boxesare some arrows Continue down the passage
Smash the barrels to get a Health Elixer Cross the bridge and go into the next passage
There will be two Wartoksin here
In between the boxes you will find some Arrows and a Heavy Bow Go out of the passage and along the path
Be careful of that Giant Wartokas it will throw anything it finds at you including other Wartoks
Now slide down to the lower level and go down the path to the West When you get the option turn north
You will be on the other side of theBig portal that we saw ealier that we couldn't get through
Just a littleto the west on a small ledge you will find a Floor Switch
Step on it tolet Arokh in
Careful there is a Giant Wartok to the south who can throwexplosives at you Go back south and then along the path to the west
There will be a CrowDragon here and a few Wartoks on the ground Now go south again
There is a Cannon here and two Wartoks as well
And tothe west of this is yet another Cannon
There will also be a Dragon
flying around here
it's not a Crow Dragon nor is it an Elder Dragon isit just a Dragon
A little more west and we find another sealed portal
Just to the left ofthe portal is a ledge with a switch
We can't land there yet but we canfry up all the Wartoks inside A little to the east is a passage small enough for Rynn to fit through Go through
You will see a Giant Wartok across the way
Turn right andfollow the little path along the cliff's edge
Follow that until you getto a room with a ladder and a Wartok inside it
Smash the barrels in hereto get a Health Elixer and an Invisibility Potion Climb down the ladder and you'll be in the ledge that we were shooting upearlier
Walk out to the edge and flip the switch to open the portal
Find the Banded Mail Go back up the ladder and then exit the little room but don't go anywhereon the path
We're going to hop down off the ledge to a smaller ledgebelow this only works if you are all the way down the path
Plus it willstill hurt a little From here slide down to the next little ledge be sure that you actuallymake the ledge if you don't you could die
and from there to the nextledge until you get to the ground
There will probably be about two Wartokshere Take the path that heads southerly until you get to some large Wartoks atcamp
Here you will find some Banded Mail a Battle Hammer and from theWartoks a Life Potion Now go back to the main area and head East
When the path diverges to thenorth go up that way
the east path heads up to a cliff over the Wartokscamp if you want an easier way to kill them you could try rolling thoseboulders onto them which isn't as easy as it sounds
In this little area there are a couple of Wartoks and a Giant Wartok
Plusnear the boxes you can find some arrows You can also open the gate here to get back out but you can't get Arokh in Go a little to the south and go east through the path hidden by some trees On top of a box you will find an Invulnerability potion Now go out the Gate and onto Arokh
Exit the Area As you come into the area the game will take over and you get a littlecutscene with an old dragon friend Myrock
He tells you that he has anew master and will never bond with a human again
And then he fights you Same Dragon Fighting rules apply fly around trying not to get killed whileattacking yourself When he is good and dead you get another Dragon Rune of Ice
Hint The Ice attack is a little different from the others
It will freezeyour enemies but it won't go that last step and kill them
For thatswitch to the Fire attack and attack normally
They will then burstinto pieces
Once you're ready go through the next tunnel and into the next Area
Islands Before you can do anything you get to watch a Cutscene which explains whatyou have to do in this area
You know find a wizard and take his RiftCrystal
Find Rimril This one isn't hard
Fly to the Northwest to the temple where the Wizardis hiding
On the way are some Ice Dragons Also about halfway up to the Northwest you can land on the land there andfind some Goblins and some treasure
Smash a barrel there to get some FlameArrows
Goblins These buggers like to shoot you with arrows and sometimes evenFlaming Arrows
Hit them with Arokh if you can but avoid theirarrows
If you get close to them they attack with their bayonets
Rimril explains that the Succubi are dirty liars and that they probably haveyour brother taken captive
So you want to take his test to get the RiftCrystal but you need the Elemental Amulet to take the test and to get theAmulet you need the Bell Hammer
Great There is a small cave hidden to the west here that leads to a beach butseems rather pointless
Grimstone Towers You will see these giant looking towers with a piece ofGrimstone at the top
Shoot the stone out with Arokh orthey'll hit you with a lightning attack
Get the Bell Hammer Go now to the south west corner of the map where the little icon is
On theway you will encounter more Dragons and Towers as well as some actualGiants
not Giant Wartoks but actual Giants
Giants These things behave almost exactly like their cousin the Giant Wartok but they have an unlimited supply of axes to throw at you
Your bestbet is to blast them from Arokh but make sure to avoid those axes If you get in close they have a big Club to whack you with
Just to the north of the Map Icon that we are heading for you will find someruins
In one of the ruins is a Fire Crystal
You will also find someGiant Mosquito's here
this is still on the upper level you know the onewith the grass
Giant Mosquito These things dive in to attack but otherwise remain as farfrom you as possible
Plus they attack so swiftly that youbarely have time to hit them
You may get lucky with yoursword but you will likely have to shoot them with your Bow
use the normal arrows Now fly down to the lower level to find the Doorway
Bring Arokh inside anda new level should load up Walk in a little ways and a Cutscene will take over as you talk to a SoulShadow
She was the guardian of this place when it was a city and becauseof a mistake is doomed to stay here forever as a soul shadow
She wants youto bring her the Soul Crystal of her slain Dragon
Ruins of Alwarren Retrieve Tuiri's Soul Crystal Fly further into the cave
There are some Wartoks and Cannons in here When you get to the area just after the second cannon there will be a cavethat goes northward
Go up that way to find a Wartok camp At the camp search around to find a Speed Scimitar
Although ittechnically isn't any speedier than a normal Scimitar it is still neat There are also some Health Elixers here Now there is a new path that heads south take that path
When you get to aLake fly across it and land near the gate on the other side You have to send Rynn in alone at first
You will quickly find a Wartokcamp kill the Wartoks and flip the switch
There is a Giant here
DO NOTATTACK until you go back and get Arokh Now with Arokh go in and roast that Giant
Continue down the path throughthe open gate You will be at another underground lake
Have Rynn dive into the lake andgo south and west to find the small cave with a Key
Vykruta's Axe Key tobe more precise Now get back on Arokh and take the south path down awhile
There are a fewWartoks here and it's a close situation so be careful On the next doorway you will find a Flame Crystal You have to go in as Rynn
Kill the two Wartoks here and be careful not tofall into that oh so obvious trap pit there Go into the next passage and all the way down it to the next room
Therewill be small Wartoks and one big one with a shield
Use the key that wejust got back at the lake on the small box to the right of the Portculis atthe opposite end of the chamber
Inside is Vykruta's Axe
Very nice
unfortunately its durability is Go back to the lake and this time take the North Path
Follow this passageEast and Up past the waterfalls until you get to a walking path that headsnorth and go up that You will come up to a Gate guarded by some Goblins
Smash one of thebarrels to get a Life Potion Flip the switch to open the Large Gate
Go through and kill that Giant thatis just standing there waiting for you Walk down into the East Passage
You will have to get off Arokh and go inon foot
Be careful in there there are many dangerous enemies Go down the passage
You will find some Goblins shooting Fire Arrows aroundand actually hurting themselves in the process
Grab the Soul Crystal andyou will be attacked by TWO knights this time
Fun Go back to Arokh
The gate that you came in is now closed and the otherone is open so go out that way
There will be Goblins here shooting at youwith Fire Arrows and normal Arrows
Blast the Barrels to find a HealthElixer Continue down the passage until you get out
There will be a Giant someWartoks cannons and a Giant Mosquito here Drop down into the pit and take the passage to the south here Fly back to where we first met the Soul Shadow it's the skeleton by theGate by the Entrance of this cave and walk up to the Skeleton
After alittle cutscene in which the Soul Shadow explains what you do now sheis freed
Collect all Magic Barrier Runes and Place in City Seal Go into the now open gate
There is a pedestal here and in the center isthe first of the Magic Barrier Runes
Take it and you will be attacked bya Knight but this one can attack you from a distance
Run up and attackhim but then run back to near Arokh and have the knight follow you
Arokhwill attack the knight making him much easier to beat Go into the little passage to the West with the skeleton but don't slidedown the path yet
Look down
There is a Health Elixer there
If you getit just right you can get it but since it's only one Health Elixer youprobably don't need it Slide down and RUN
That path is about to fall taking you to your doom At the other end you will find a Scavenger and a barrel Further down the passage the floor is missing in places but the rest ofthe floor is stable so just avoid falling in As you exit the passage you will find an Armored Spider well that's whatit looks like
kill it the same way you would a Scavenger Continue going along the path past the wall
Your map will be updated totell you that a Rune is nearby but you can't get it from here just yet Continue along the path past the Armored Spiders and as the path curves tothe right go that way until you reach a Knight
There will be Chainmailhere as well Head further into the passage and again there will be a section with littlefloor left
There are some Health Elixers here as well
Go past this areaby hopping from floor to floor
When you get past this small area therewill be a Scavenger waiting for you Just past the Scavenger are some Flaming Arrows
Go out of this passage You are now at the Second Rune
But this one has flame all around it sowe have to be a little clever
Just behind the circle of flame are someruins
Jump up onto the lowest ruin by the flames and push the littleblock there onto the flames
Go into the circle and take the Rune Now just slide back down to the main path below Instead of taking the path as it curves right we're going to take the paththat goes due south
There will be lots of Goblins here You should walk right to the next Rune
Near the fire circle is a largestone block
Jump onto the small stone block and from that one to thelarge stone block now jump into the circle to avoid the flames
Get thethird Rune
Now to get out jump onto the pedestal and from there jumpback to the large stone There is a Life Potion hidden in the stone thing to the left facing it fromthe passage of the south stairs Now just to the north of the flame circle is a smaller passage go insidethat
When you get to the ladders go up them Head east until you reach the Barrier which is now on the floor
There isa path to the left that leads to a Mithril Long Sword Walk across the Barrier don't worry you'll be fine and into the nextpassageway
There will a couple of Goblins here Finish going through the passage and then when you get to the small pit fall down it to get to the fourth Rune Watch the Flame Circle carefully
Notice that one of the flames will go outever so briefly
Time it just right and run in to get the Fourth Rune Head north through the next passage
When you exit it there will be someGoblins and you can see the Fifth Rune to the north of that
However don't just run over there
Take it slowly
You will have a small area thatyou have to jump or you might slide down to the lava below
Be careful Cross the suspension bridge to get to the flame circle
Here you mustattack that water basin until the area fills with water putting out theflames
Get the Fifth Rune Go back to where we got the fourth Rune To the south is a little Portculis that can only be opened from the otherside
Well there's a Wartok in there and if you wait he'll open it foryou
Go inside Follow the passage down until you find the next Flaming Circle At the opposite end of the chamber is a staircase and on that staircase isa broken column
Push that column towards the Flaming Circle and it willknock the Rune off of the pedestal
Go out and grab it
Once you do thata new Knight will appear Go into the next passage and out to find the City Center where we get todeposit all these Runes Walk up to each pedestal and press ENTER to deposit a Rune there
Once allare in place the Middle Gem will glow and the Barriers will drop There are two ways to go about this now One you can just go into the doorand into the City or two if you want some treasure like a Banded Mail you can go back to where we got the fifth Rune and follow the little walk through here Extra Treasure Go back to where we got the Fifth Rune Follow the little path upwards and into the next passage
Careful thispassage ends with a steep drop
You should be able to see a ledge in thecenter of the pit
You can make this jump even if it looks bad Once across you can get the Great Sword from the center of the skeleton
I don't think that he'll miss it
Jump across to the next ledge and into the next passage
You will come upto a place with a skeleton hanging who is wearing a Banded Mail
There arealso some Flaming Arrows near the barrels Go into the next little and dark passage There will be an Explosive here stand back from it and shoot it with yourbow regular arrows work fine
Go through You will be back with Arokh here

He throws giant axes so you might want to avoidthose and hit him with Arokhs attacks
He doesn't seem to be that muchtougher than a regular giant Now get off of Arokh and walk to the pedestal to get the Bellhammer
Theground will shake as a new Dragon Crystal has appeared Get back on Arokh and get the Crystal of Lightning There's only one way out of here and that's the exit to the north whereArokh came in by the First Rune
And from there you can leave this wholeCave

Also after you hit him he will vanish and reappearelsewhere
Make sure to know where he is at all times
He isn'ttoo hard to hit
Go into the coffin to get the Key

The best way that I found to do it is this Get near the coffin butnot right next to the ledge
Now turn around so that your back is facingthe coffin
Use the Right Mouse button to get yourself perfectly lined upso that you will jump into the center of the coffin
Now SAVE IT and back flip into the coffin

As you get near it it will open and a Knight willpop out Go inside and follow the passageway up to another Spiked Door which alsoopens

You are now in the roomwhere we met up with the Succubus
Go to the center of the chamber andshe'll reappear
She tells you to follow a bright shiny fairy thing to theThrone Room The Fairy will zip ahead to the east and open the Spiked Door there
Followit through the door and down the passage

When you get to it go through the door There is a moving platform connecting the top ledge that you are on to thebottom ledge that you want to get to Head down the path to find a skeleton with Health Elixers an InvisibilityPotion and a new Energy Bow
Now go back to the Platform
A Knight mayhave followed you here Go back to where we had the choice of going left or right and go down theother way
Just before you reach the door you will find yes anotherKnight this one has a Health Elixer Go through the door and down the path
Go past the Spiked Door and therewill be another Knight who also has a Health Elixer Go down to where the fairy is floating by
If you go in this door youwill quickly discover that the next door in there is locked and you can't goany further
Well continue down the path until you reach a second door andgo through that one Well you will be locked inside by a mean Wartok
There are some MagicArrows and a Heavy Bow here
At the end of the room is a strange lookingfloor
Crouch and hit it
that's why we keep Atimar's Blade you know
Fall down then go through the South Door
the north door takes you back towhere we just were Then go through the passage
There will be a Knighthere From the Knight head along a path to the North East to get to a skeletonwho has Health Elixers a Life Potion and the Cleaver
VERY NICE Continue onward
Go to the Rising Platform and jump onto it
From therejump onto the ledge
Go down this path until you reach the Door to theThrone Room
There will be a Knight here
Go into the door Go down the passage
It leads to a small room with a locked door and anopen door
Go through the open door
As you get out you will see a BlackKnight at the far end of the chamber
Black Knight DO NOT ATTACK THESE FACE TO FACE
Hit them with your EnergyBow about a half dozen times
Go over to where you killed him to get the Mourn Bringer a very nice sword You can safely toss Atimar's Blade away as this blade is not onlyIndestructable but also Vampiric
if you attack a creature it gives youlife SWEET
Find Grimstone Shipping Docks Go north and a little cutscene will take over
You get to see that Arokhis going to be shipped to some Master
You better find that ship quick Head out of the Throne Room back into that chamber where there was thelocked door
It ain't locked now
Go into it Once you pop out of the passage there will be a big nasty Giant here
Youmust kill him to get those doors to the south to open
Once he's dead andthe door is open go through it In this passage are some really big Scavengers
When you reach the boxesthere will be a door to the south for you to go through You are now where you need to be
Rescue Arokh There are many small Wartoks here as well as a normal giant
When youfirst enter take a sharp left into a small path and follow that for awhileto get some arrows
Then return all the way out Now to get onto the ship we need to curve around the water by going south You are now at the Docks themselves
There will be a Wartok here Jump from the docks onto the small plank thing sticking out from the side ofthe ship A cutscene will take over and take you to the next Level
Volcano After an amusing cutscene in which the Wartoks scurry off to avoid somestrange form of punishment run up to Arokh
He tells you that you need togo get the Rune Cage Key from Queen Shilla
Retrieve Rune Cage Key from Queen Shilla Head to the West and up to a little ledge
There is another Dark Knighthere run up to him and show him the sharp end of the Mourn Bringer
Whenhe dies he leaves Dark Scimitars behind Keep going upwards along the path
There are Wartoks here with GreatSwords
Go into the passageway
There is another Dark Knight in thepassage When you exit the passage you will be in a large open area and staring downa very large Scavenger
King Scavenger This is the biggest Scavenger of them all
He is so largethat he takes a great many hits even with the Mourn Bringer So as soon as you sight him peg him with arrows
It takesaround or so to bring him down normal arrows
Go across the path and into the next door As you exit the passage a cutscene will take place
You get to see yourbrother but he isn't exactly happy to be there
Seems that he is going tobe possessed by a certain dark master
As the meeting ends Shilla willfly back out the passage Before you chase after Shilla there are some treasure chests to attend to they are located in the western end of the room and one has Magic Arrows and Health Elixers and the other has a Lightning Axe and a Life Potion There is a passage to the south but that's not where we're going
We'regoing back up the ramp to the West
Follow the path around and up to thepassage that we came in through
Go through the passage to get back to thebridge
Shilla is here you both say some things and then you fight
Queen Shilla Shilla can't shoot you luckily but she does fly around a lot and that means that you have to use your Energy Bow
She willtry to get above you and fall on you complete with little fartnoises
Shoot her a bunch of times to kill her
Grab the Rune and get back to Arokh
As you run past the bridge a newDragon Rune will appear Go free Arokh and bring him back to the Lava Rune
After that a smallcutscene will ensue as Arokh tells you that you need to get the Rune Bladeto beat Navaros
Find the Dragon Armor Rune However we need to get the Dragon Armor first Before you can do much of anything you will be attacked by a Skeletal Dragona very tough enemey
Beat it like any other Dragon Get off Arokh and go back to the Meeting Place with Rynn Now go down the southern passage
Careful there are several trap doorshere but they trigger before you step on them so just go slowly and youwill be fine As you exit the passage you will see a couple giant blades spinning
Whatwe are going to do is to jump across the blades when they stop
When thefirst one stops jump onto it
You'll have to wait for it to stop AGAINbefore jumping to the next
Now while this one is moving walk down to theslender end of the blade
When they stop again just jump onto the ledge Move down the passage to find a Knight
Be careful of the exploding lavachunks that will fly out of the ravine here Now we have to jump across to the next ledge
Jump while the lava chunksare at their peak Now to make the next jump stand near that big Blue Crystal and run andjump across
There is a Knight here
Kill him and get is Health Elixer Go into the next door
There will be several Knights in here Run down the passage and then jump onto the ledge
There will be yetanother Knight here
He also has a Health Elixer
and the Flaming Sword but they all have that Jump onto the final ledge and then go through the door Here you will find a weird green looking platform
Jump onto it to get theDragon Armor Rune Jump back to the ledge and from there go to the next door
Be careful ofSpikes as you go down this passage
hehe This next room is by far one of the coolest in the game
Four Mummy Mageswill pop out of the ground
The best advice that I can give you forfighting them off is to never ever stop moving
Run dodge their skullattacks and their green bolts and whack at them
Once they're all dead go to the Green Geyser whatever in the center of the room You should now be up one level
Go down the passage Once you are out of the passage jump onto the moving platform to get backto the spinning blade thingie
From the blade jump back to the ledge andhead back to the meeting area When you get back there will be a trio of Mummy Mages Mucking around
Onceall are dead you get a Life Potion Go back outside and retrieve Arokh
Get the Dragon Armor We're going to fly Arokh westward to the thing on the map that looks like abig mouth on the Map it looks like a mouth but in the game it's nothingmore than a really big cave it's by the three Grimstone Towers on the map just to the north of them
By the way there are lots of Dragons Towers and Dark Knights on the way
You can't get in the main entrance because ofa force field like that's never happened
So on the side of the cave aresome small entrances where Rynn can enter Once inside there are two Knights
Kill them and find the passage thatleads further inside since there are two entrances you don't want to gothrough the door that just goes back outside Go down that weird stream of green flecks to get to a ledge guarded by someMummy Mages
There is a lever here to lower the force field to let Arokhin
He will fly right in so you don't have to go out and get him Now get on Arokh and fly to the east and then down the river of lava There will be several Dragons down here
When you see the small ledge landon it and have Rynn get off of Arokh Walk up to the small pedestal to the left of the door and place the Runethere
That will open up the door
Go inside At the end of the chamber is a chest
Don't open it just yet
When you doopen it two Mummy Mages will pop out of their little coffins
So to speedthings up make space in your inventory for it before hand and de equipyour weapon
Then open it jump into the chest and get it ENTER quicklyhit 'i' and double click it hit 'i' again and fight the Mummy Mages
Oryou could wait until they're dead before getting it
Either way Return outside
Find the Runeblade Fly to the west and keep low
There are lots of Skeletal Dragons and otherthings like Dark Knights and regular Dragons
well Ebon Dragons Youwill find a really suspicious looking thing on the ground it looks like adome and is all glowing with lightning shooting out from it
That is theRift World down there To the east of that at the very lowest point is a big Gate
Fly into it Just inside the entrance is a Dragon
There is also a Dark Knight up onthe ledge
Kill him to get an Invisibility Potion
Hint If you get close to a Dark Knight they can't throw their lightningspears at you
But if you back away again they will get them back out The trick is to get close but not too close
Continue up the Cave and you will see that the next Gate is sealed off How typical Fly to the ledge and have Rynn get off of Arokh
There will be a risingplatform here get on it There are Dark Knights up here so as you are fighting off on of them theother will still be throwing the Lightning Spears at you
Fun Jump down to the next ledge and deal with this Dark Knight Go into the next door
You are on a high ledge and below you is anothertorture chamber with a Dark Knight and a Mummy Mage
You could just jumpdown there and kill them
But you do have a bow
In any case youeventually end out down there The Dark Knight should have dropped a Rune Key
Take it and go down thepath
There will be a Knight here To your right you can see a door don't go that way continue down the path On the boxes are some Health Elixers Further down the path is a sealed door use your key to get in
Inside area number of chests as you open each one a Dark Knight will appear andattack you
The treasure that you find is An Invulnerability Potion anEnergy Bow a Lightning Crystal and a Life Potion Now go back to that door that we saw earlier and go through it
There isan obligatory Dark Knight standing on the bridge here Now we have to go down a VERY dark path to the right
Can't see it
Good There is a Knight down below kill him and get a Life Potion Go all the way down this path to a lever
Pull the lever to break that sealfrom earlier and let Arokh in Get on Arokh and fly south
You will get to what appears to be a dead endrather quickly
Drop altitude R CTRL to drop into a pit
There will bea Dragon here
Make sure to drop ALL the way down There is another Dragon here
Go down the cavern
Fly down it until youget to a large suspicous looking door
We aren't going in there yet butkeep a note of it
Now turn right and fly up that Lavafall
Find the Lava Rune We'll make our way out to a nice large room
It's so large that we may aswell be outside
There are some Dragons here
Fly up to the ledge with theDoor and land Have Rynn get off of Arokh and go into the door
There are Dark Knightshere Go into the next passageway Jump across to the next ledge
There is a Mummy Mage Casket here you candeal with it now or later either way
In any case jump onto the nextledge and go through the door When you exit there will be a Dark Knight
Here are some more giantswinging blades for you to ride
Ride the first one over to where it meetsthe second then jump to the second and ride that one up to the ledge Run into the doorway and down to a lever
Flip the lever Now go back to where the Mummy Mage Casket was
you don't have to ride theBlades again there is a moving platform you can take back down Once the Mummy Mage is dealt with get in the coffin and wait for it to takeyou to the passage above
Run down to the Glowing Invisible Bridge
Youcan't actually see the Bridge but you can see the little Glow Spots thatfall on the Bridge Cross the bridge Run into the room and the FIRST thing that you should see are a whole lotof Mummy Mage Coffins
In the chest is the Lava Rune Now get all the way back to that door I pointed out earlier
Get the Rune Blade Go into the door and down the passage
You get to a large lava filled roomwith a small pedestal
Land and go put the Rune in the Pedestal
The lavawill drain almost completely away Get back on Arokh
Fly down to a small ledge just in front of you
Thereis a small door that is VERY hard to see
Go inside We are now in the Rune Blade Chamber
Yay
Too bad it is encased in aGiant Block of Ice
There is a lever here flip it thrice three times The center will have moved placing that large Torch thing under a pillar ofLight Go back out and get on Arokh
Fly up to the hole that is right above thetorch and have Arokh shoot a fire ball in
It's easiest if you aim withthe Right Mouse button
Once it is lit send Rynn back inside Go back to the lever and pull it three more times Now run around the room until you get to a giant Statue
On the back of theStatue is a large green button push it and the Statue will fire a giantarrow through the fire and into the ice melting it Now just go up there and get your Rune Blade
You just got the best weaponin the game
Congratulations
Enter the Rift Fly back to that weird Dome looking thing and you will enter the Rift Worldthe last section of the game
Rift World Note The map doesn't work here
You don't really need one in any case
Kill Navaros You will be in a large chamber and you are about to be attacked by surlyDragons so you may want to get out of the way
Try to pick them off oneby one if you can There's only once place to go fly to the ledge and land on it
Then haveRynn get off on foot
There is a Giant Door here those round things arenot doors so don't try flying into them go through it There will be another set of doors in front of you but that is locked turn right and run down the passage
save it before you hit the cutscene and not a quicksave so that you can go back to it later if you die
Pretty soon a Cutscene will take over as Navaros takes possession of yourbrother's body
Now you have to fight him
Evil Delon He may be slow to attack but since most of his attacks kill youinstantly it makes up for it
Heh
Hit him as fast as you canwith the Rune Blade and dodge his attacks
Keep moving andattacking
Eventually the evil will be drawn out of Delon but he will fall into theVoid and a big nasty creature will pop out
Yes this is Navaros theLast Bad Guy
Navaros Well well he's a giant four headed dragon
Fun
Of course youwant to avoid his Breath Attacks and if you get in too close to himhe bites
Plus he only has one area vulnerable to attack theinside of his mouth
Heh
Unless you're feeling crazy use theregular breath attack fire because you can launch a lot of themin the time you can get one lava breath off
Blow each head up tobeat him
Congratulations you have beaten Drakan Order of the Flame
Now you get tosee the ending
All seconds of it Miscellaneous Tips Save it at the beginning of each level NOT a quicksave
Keep these saves incase you forget something and want to get it later
In addition to dodging attacks by moving around you can duck attacks R CTRL and also block attacks press on the number pad
Some weapons have Secondary attacks
Weapons such as the Flaming Sword orVykruta's Axe
Use these weapons by pressing on the number pad
Also when on Arokh each of his breath attacks has a secondary attack accessedthe same way as normal weapons that is pressing on the number pad
Save your arrows for the later stages when you REALLY need them
Don't killthings like Wartoks with arrows wait until you have to kill Dark Knights Mummy Mages and Succubi
The best keyboard mouse combination that I have found is to use my left hand onthe E S D F movement keys and use my right hand for the mouse
This wayI can also easily use the L SHIFT Sneak Command
If you are using the keyboard to make life easier for yourself you should addsome keyboard commands for Turn Left and Turn Right
I chose W for Left andR for Right to put them near the other keyboard commands for movement
If you have a Scroll Wheel on your mouse you can use it to cycle through yourweapons
Save often
Use the Quick Save 'Q' and the Quick Load 'L'
But don't just usethe Quick Save in that you could get yourself into really sticky situations Also have a Safety Save in an area that you know is safe
Save this one the normal way by hitting ESC then clicking on SAVE
To skip any of the Cutscenes press the ENTER key
Cheating You can cheat by typing the ' ' key followed by different texts iamgod The gods will then favor you granting you invulnerability smoghead You will get your full strength back
If you only have the demo use these instead sanctuary gives you invulnerabilitysmeghead You will get your full strength back
To turn any of the cheats off again simply type them in again
Unlimited Potions and CrystalsThere is a way to get Unlimited Potions amp Crystals in the game
Open up theInventory and drag a potion out but don't drop the Potion
Now close theinventory and you have a new potion
Check it out by looking into yourinventory again
This ONLY works if you have at least of something
Ifyou don't it won't do anything
Oddities After having chopped all the legs off of a spider I had the pleasure ofnoting that it was still alive and flopping around
Hehe
You can also chop up dead bodies into small parts hehe
Why can't you take the Armor from the Dying Man near the mines
If you attack an egg sac with the Flame Sword it will turn black
Arokh is mispelled on the First Area map
as Arohk The PA announcement at the beginning of the Lava World is rather odd Especially the bit about Punctuality
Doesn't the Dragon Armor look like it was designed by H R
Geiger
Aliens Just who is left alive in Drakan that we are saving anyway
The only peoplethat we have ever met tended to be dead dying or about to die
Hmmm Bugs In the Volcano world when I killed a Dark Knight who had a key the key fellTHROUGH THE FLOOR to the lava below
That made it just a little hard to get
Also in the Volcano world after coming out of the Meeting Room cave aftergetting the Dragon Armor Rune Arokh will sometimes land in a completelyinaccesible location
And since he won't go short distances when called youmay be completely out of luck
if you have troubles with this one simply getthe Dragon Armor Rune before freeing Arokh Jason Grundy had this to add As for bugs I've had Rynn fall through the floor on at least seperateoccasions walking up the stairs that fall from the ceiling in the tower getting the key in the lava room in the tower in the succubi lair and at anealier point
I've also had succubi fly INTO a wall completely and deadenemys have the health potion they drop go INTO the wall and of coursedoesn't come out
My damn fire crystals keep disappearing from my inventoryat the worst times too
Arokh has gotten stuck to some things before agate in the city area comes to mind he 'popped' off after a bit but I wassure I was going to have to reload
Items This should be finished but I may have missed something
If so email me aboutit
Also I didn't list things like Worn Mace since it is just a Mace with alower durability
If the Durability says then that means that that item is indestructible

Use the k key continuously until he is knocked out cold
This way gives you ample time to check the second floor

Select the dialogues Vacancies lie calm and manager
He will allow you to look around
This way gives less time to check out the second floor and you 'might' eventually have to fight him later if you take time on the second floor

Time the pizza to finish
Quickly hide at the entrance to the basement
Sneak behind him while he's eating pizza and go to the stairs past the TV
Second floor Go upstairs and see a girl on a mattress attached to a machine in room
There's medical equipment on the wall
This is not a hotel it is a laboratory
Go next door and see that April's room is locked
Ignore the girl that came out of room
She is lost in her own world
Go to the other end of the hallway and into the bathroom
Take thehandleoff the window
Climb the stairs to the third floor and see that the door is locked
Go down and enter the room left of the stairs on the second floor
Use the handle on the window
Climb out to the broken fire escape
See a red covered bed in room at the next window
If you took too much time checking things out and used the dialogue way to get to the second floor Vinnie might come up and say you tricked him
You need to fight him
Similar frontal assault won the fight for me
Face him move forward and use the k key continuously
The man will fall down and settle under the stairs
If you use the fight way earlier you will have ample time to find room and do the rest that follows
Or if you hear Vinnie come up you can hide or sneak and he will go away
Third floor Climb the ladder left of the window to get to the third floor fire escape
The rusty ladder falls off
Open window and enter
See medical equipment on the wall
Exit the room and check the other door on the left
A man in his shorts walks by Zo automatically hides
Go forward and right to the bathroom
Take thefilthy towelfrom the rack
If the man arrives at the bathroom go to the end of the bathroom by the shower and he will not see you
Exit the bathroom and go forward to the hallway
Look inside the open room on the left and see the man in shorts sleeping on dirty sheets
These are some ways to do this part that I found
Take the sheets and it will waken the man
This is an easy fight since he's might be drugged or still sleepy
Take thedirty sheets

Wait at the other hallway or check the other doors and the man will eventually leave the room
Take thedirty sheetsthen
Exit the room left and go forward to the next hallway
See a window with a radiator underneath
Look through the window and see room with the red sheet on the bed
In inventory combine the towel and dirty sheet to get amakeshift rope
Use the makeshift rope on the radiator control
Open the window and climb down to the second floor fire escape
Room Walk the fire escape ledge to look through room

A DIFFICULT solution to this puzzle is found on page XXIX of the game manual
The goal is to remove the last flame or flames so that only the chalice remains thus forcing the Knight to drink
NOTE you will always lose the first game because the Knight places the chalice on a stable square
Thus you must win the second and third games
You must remove the flames so that when they are gone the chalice is on a shaded square for the new active board dimension
If the chalice is on a stable square it will always be on an unstable square at the next turn
Likewise if it s on an unstable square it s always possible to make it stable on the next turn
Since you go first in the second game turn away from the board andSAVE GAME
Turn back to the board and always place the chalice in a corner
Quite often the board will change and leave only the corner chalice and four flames in a row with the chalice
If this does not occur turn away from the board to reset it
Turn back to the board and try again
When you finally get four flames in a row with the corner chalice get rid of the flame next to the chalice and you win the second game
You can also win the third game by resetting the board
THIRD GAME Keep resetting the board until the knight places the chalice in the middle square on any edge
Then get rid of the next row of flames from that edge
You should end up with the chalice and only two flames on one side of it in a row along that edge
If not reset the board until you do have the chalice and two flames together for instance OOCFF
O means empty squares
Then all you have to do is get rid of the flame next to the chalice

Here's the Rod game
You will have to manipulate the x y z and rotational coordinates of the Rod of Osiris
First you must place the two keys in your inventory into the two keyholes
Click them near the upper left of the black and yellow sticker then slowly move your mouse to the upper right
You will have four tries at placing the Rod in the correct coordinates and rotational orientation right side up with empty rod on the right
The puzzle varies the initial coordinates each game
The first thing you should do at the start of the game is move all control knobs to the far left this is the position
If you turn around you can see the position of the Rod The upper left hand knob controls the X axis
Each click will move the Rod one square to the right
Note that if the Rod is in the rightmost box it will move to the leftmost box in one click
The lower left hand knob controls the Z axis
Each click moves the Rod back one square along the Z axis The upper right hand knob controls the XY axis
Each click moves the Rod down one square to the right on the X axis and two squares up the Y axis The lower right hand knob controls the rotation of the Rod
The Rod must end up vertical right side up
You can set this knob to rotate the Rod upright in the first control settings movement then set it back to zero to keep other movements from changing the upright position
It's best to change one or two movements at a time
Once you learn the workings of the coordinates you might realize that certain controls are no longer needed and you can turn them back to zero
You have four moves to complete the puzzle before having to try again
Once you've completed the Rod puzzle all three coordinates will be flashing

GAME BOOMERS hints cheats and walkthroughs
General Hints Talk as much to each character as possible without insulting them
For instance do not ask to meet Jackalope's girlfriend and take care to feed Bloodstone's ego
Some characters require only specific answers in order to get through a conversation
Listen to what each character tells you
Most information is important although some clues and objects in the game are decoys
Gather as many items as possible and try the items in various ways in different areas of the town
Any item mentioned here as quot explore item quot is not significant in completing the game but is something interesting in the environment
Characters tend to wander around a given area outside but will be found near the buildings mentioned if you are going to meet them
If you should run out of pocket money Mr Help will give you a little even if you have put all your money in the bank
But you must have more that what you started with to continue the game on the first night
The best way to do that is play Blackjack
Save before you begin playing and bet everything
Save again if you win return to saved game if you lose
There are lots of characters who will take cigars flowers or a sip from the jug
The ring could end up several different places if you don't follow this walkthrough
Go back to the person you gave it to and if they don't have it they will tell you w here to look
If it disappears from your inventory try Help
Some items you don't need will disappear after a time from your inventory as well
If you give away the flowers and want more go back to where you picked them up
There will not always be more flowers and the cigars are limited
Walkthrough This walkthrough was designed to allow as much experience in one game as possible and to allow a sub plot between your character and Ruby to develop fully
Not all listed steps are necessary for game completion
The main goal for each time period is listed first so if you stray from the walkthrough you will know what is expected
You may gather more than one of some items but your inventory will only hold one of each thing
If a more detailed description might be helpful in solving some area the clue is marked with an asterisk and the details are found on the last few pages
This will allow you to do some thinking for yourself while still getting as much out of the game as you can
