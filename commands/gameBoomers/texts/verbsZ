Zanzarah Walkthrough Written and donated by MOJO Well here it is folks the long awaited and searched for Zanzarah walkthrough
Please do not copy this walkthrough without first contacting MOJO at webmaster adventureworld zzn com This walkthrough contains as much information as was possible I do not claim to have discovered every area of ZANZARAH however this is how I completed the game
I have mentioned as many important objects as possible My advice for this game is to train your fairies hard at least one fairy of each type pick up and open anything that you come across and save before you are going to take on a larger adversary than just the tree and stone fairies hellip hellip hellip LONDON You start the game as AMY lying on your bed reading a book your mother shouts up the stairs that she has to leave and goes out You then hear a noise on the stairs and you will watch an FMV clip of RABI the Goblin placing a CHEST in the attic hellip hellip hellip
Go straight up every flight of stairs until you come to the attic you can look around the house but there is nothing to do here AMY will see the CHEST on the shelf open it and you will have the RUNE BAG and this enables you to move from one place to another quickly Use the RUNE BAG to take you to the FAIRY GARDEN
FAIRY GARDEN You start this area in a cave go to the mouth of the cave and RABI will appear he explains about the prophecy and how the SHADOW FAIRIES are making their lives miserable and that you are the one that has been chosen to help them RABI will give you a FAIRY BAG which is capable of carrying all manner of objects without growing in size
He tells you that to survive the journey you will need your own FAIRY and that you should go and talk to the FOREST ELVES in the village of ENDEVA Finish talking to RABI and walk to your left out of the cave read the BOOK and it explains that MAGIC is turning the FAIRY WORLD into chaos and that now only a human can save them Go down the slope and to the left and pick up the HEALING POTION then turn back to the right and walk as far as you can you will enter ENDEVA
VILLAGE OF ENDEVA As you enter the village talk to the OWL on the bridge he will explain that there are OWLS throughout ZANZARAH that are there to help you carry on over the bridge and speak to the ELF he will tell you that pixies have stolen his SPHERE and have hidden it somewhere in the village but he doesn rsquo t know where Walk past the elf and go in to the first door that opens on your right talk to RUFUS he rsquo s the one on the left and he will say that if you have come to help them fight the PIXIE PLAGUE that you had better go to his house and pick one of FAIRIES there to be your own he gives you the KEY to his house so that you can get in
Leave and walk up the hill and to the left the house with the large PADLOCK is RUFUS rsquo S house the KEY he gave you will unlock the door Inside you will see fairies here it is up to you which one you chose
I chose the NATURE FAIRY lsquo Sillia rsquo At the end of the bed is a RUNE pick it up it is a RETURN RUNE and will take you back to your place of birth Walk to the window at the far end of the room and open the CHEST you will find more healing potions here
Leave RUFUS rsquo S house and go to the house next to the waterwheel behind this house you will find the SPHERE you are now capable of catching fairies with an experience level of Go back and speak to RUFUS he will tell you that he can help no more and that you need to speak to LUCIUS Walk up the hill to the top and LUCUIS is standing in the gateway he will say that he will fetch a PIXIE BAG and meet you at the other end of the FAIRY GARDEN to show you how to use it Follow in LUCIUS rsquo S footsteps and you are in the FAIRY GARDEN
There at least large trees in here where if you get too close you will have to fight the FAIRY that lives in them try to walk as far away round them as possible and you will meet an ELF who challenges you to a FAIRY FIGHT you have no choice but to agree When you manage to defeat his FAIRIES he will give you a MANA POTION Keep walking and you enter a different section of the garden to the right at the bottom of the cliff is a HEALING POTION to pick up At the far end of the area is a signpost this will point you the way to LUCIUS he will give you the PIXIE BAG and this enables you to catch PIXIES Now you can go and rid the village of the annoying little characters there is one causing havoc in the spell shop
Now go back over the bridge near the waterwheel and back over the bridge the ELF there will tell you how to catch and let you practice training fairies Now you can go through the entrance being guarded by SEAMUS because you have a PIXIE BAG Go through this entrance and you will come across several signposts at this point I took the one to TIRALIN
This will take you through the enchanted forest talk to the elf there he explains that certain fairies cast spells which have a continuous effect such as poison he will give you a MEDICINE VIAL just in case Carry on up the brick way path until you come to a STONE DOOR a DWARF will appear and tell you that RABI told him to watch out for you and that he is very sorry but needs to leave and look for his father QUINLIN who has gone missing since the trouble started Carry on through the doors ndash you are now entering TIRALIN
TIRALIN ndash City of Fairies On entering the city you will see a SWAMP GOBLIN sitting on the edge of a fountain say hello and then take the doorway to the right and he follows you and explains that the SWAMP VILLAGE is under siege from the SHADOW ELVES and that the village is blocked off and you must help save them
Take a look around the city there is a spell shop and a tavern talk to all elves and goblins that you meet they may be able to sell you important items or give you info If you speak to the other SWAMP GOBLIN he tells you that the only way into the swamp is with a SWAMP RUNE the lady in the TAVERN will sell you one for crystals The elf in front of the TOWN HALL large building behind the fountain will sell you they will cost you a total of coins Inside the TOWN HALL you can speak to the MAYOR and upstairs there is a CHEST on the landing open it and you will have the MAP and there is another storybook to read When you come out of the TOWN HALL to go through the doorway on the left you will have to fight SEAMUS and his fairies
You can rsquo t go through this doorway until you have defeated him When you have defeated him make your way through walk towards the large door at the end and EIRIK the fairy master will challenge you once defeated he explains that he is still looking for that invincible combination of fairies The entrance to the CATACOMBS is right through the arch from the main gate and then direct right again walk down the slope to the locked door and you are at the entrance to the CATACOMBS Make sure you investigate all of these you will come to a large room at the bottom but cannot go any further without a key as the DWARVES have sealed the rest of them off
THE ENCHANTED FOREST Make your way through here to reach the RUINS FOREST HUT the dwarf lady will ask you to remove prickly bushes from her land and for that she gives you the ELEVATOR KEY then she mentions that her husband is still in the SWAMP VILLAGE because he doesn rsquo t know that the bushes have gone and it would be nice if someone would tell him
SWAMP VILLAGE Explore all of the huts in these you will find the TARALIN RUNE and the MAP for the swamps Talk to the Goblins around the huts one of them will tell you that he is not going back into the swamp until the SHADOW ELF GENERAL has gone make your way into the swamp and fight all of the horrid red SHADOW ELVES once you defeat the GENERAL you rsquo ll get the WATER CONCH go back to the SWAMP VILLAGE and the goblin will tell you to follow the GHOST LIGHTS to find the NATURE CARD follow them and this will lead you into the MISTY SWAMP
MISTY SWAMP Here you will find the NATURE CARD Walk directly down the path when you enter this swamp and talk to the OWL he will again tell you to follow the GHOST LIGHTS As you follow them they bear round to the left after a short distance you have to jump parts of the swamp head for the larger raised island and the NATURE CARD is here in the middle of the trees There is also another SHADOW ELF to duel with Once you have beaten the SHADOW ELF carry on through the swamp here you can pick up a number of spheres and at least PIXIES
Keep going until you are sure that you rsquo ve checked out the whole of the SWAMP Transport yourself to THE FAIRY GARDEN
FAIRY GARDEN Talk to RABI again and he will explain that if you find the EARTH CARD and combine it with a STONE FAIRY this will move the ROCKS from your path he believes that the EARTH CARD is in the REALM OF THE CLOUDS and suggests that you visit the DWARVES in the DWARF TOWER Make your way through the FAIRY GARDEN to the COTTAGE
COTTAGE Here in front of the cottage is a SCARECROW if you speak to him he asks that you help him get rid of the CHAOS FAIRIES that are making his life a misery defeat them in a duel and he will say that you only have to ask and he will boost your FAIRIES MANA
If you hand over PIXIES LUCIUS will give you the KEY to his cellar this is the GUARDIAN OF PIXIES KEY Make your way down his stairs and open the cellar door Follow the wooden walkway downward there are plenty of crystals to collect here at the end of the wooden walkway there is a CHEST to open it you must either turn all the panels red or turn them all off once you have done this trial and error sorry you will receive the EVOLUTIONARY MAGIC OF NATURE Make your way back up the walkway to the cottage Leave the COTTAGE and take the left hand path walk through the rocks and keep going straight in this part of the garden there is the COTTAGE RUNE to be found and also a DWARF who will sell you a CHAOS FAIRY for coins plus lots of coins and bags when you rsquo ve done this follow the path away from the cottage and bear to the right keep going and you will come upon an OWL sitting on a stump you are now near the entrance to the TOWER OF DWARVES
Talk to the OWL and he will tell you that strange AIR EDDIES keep appearing Turn again up the path to your right and your heading towards the TOWER Keep going and you will find yourself in the MOUNTAIN WORLD
MOUNTAIN WORLD Once in Mountain World defeat SHADOW ELF on stone bridge and follow the path forwards you will come to another SHADOW ELF on a wooden bridge after defeating him follow the path round until you come to a pillared rock area on your left Walk to the back of it and through the opening and you will be looking down on an open valley go down into the valley and grab the PIXIES that are running around Go back up slope to where you stood when you came out of the opening just in front of you to the left is a ledge walk onto this and to the end walk into the MAGIC LIGHTS and STEPPING STONES will appear above your head Walk back up original path to the STEPPING STONES but keep walking just past them is a very thin ledge walk along this and you will find a STEEPING STONE on its own jump onto this and into the MAGIC LIGHTS now to SPHERES will appear on the other STONES go back jump the STONES and pick them up Now carry on up the slope and go through opening on left once in directly on your right there is a shaft of sunlight coming through this is another opening go through here and follow path to your left and through first opening on left and you will come to a high plateau Here you can go either left or right
Right path hellip Walk down slope and into trees on left there are some items to get here that you could probably use when done come back out of trees and carry on down path hellip
you are now in the DARK CAVES
DARK CAVES At this point I followed the path right every time there was a turnoff I took the right this brings you to another part of the ENCHANTED FOREST You cant do much here at the minute apart from pick up some coins although if you look down into the valley you will see a set of AIR EDDIES go back into the caves and go back the way you came until you come to a point where you can change paths You can go up these different paths and pick up items but the only place they lead to is that section of the ENCHANTED FOREST Come out of the caves the way you came back into MOUNTAIN WORLD MOUNTAIN WORLD Go back the way you came until you come to the SHADOW ELF once you have defeated him cross the small wooden bridge and follow the path round take the opening at the end of the path on your left and you are in the TOWER OF DWARVES

ZelenhgormEpisode The Great ShipWalkthrough by Crash Short Review Zelenhgorm is an adventure game that is divided into seven different episodes
The first episode is a very short game
It will only take you about minutes to finish the game
It has a promising story but I doubt people want to spend hundred of dollars to purchase the entire episodes where they could spend as low as for a complete adventure game
Graphic and sound quality are very good
The puzzles are integrated to the game even though sometime player could reach a point where they do not have a clue on how to progress the game
Introduction This walkthrough is designed to work according to the flow of the story
I would not tell you to pick up everything at the first time you enter a room scene
Instead you will pick up items as needed
There are so many things you could do inside Sevana that are not required for finishing the game
Those additional actions that you could do will be placed as special notes
There is one point that could make you going back and forth to solve the puzzles
When you reach the ship read the shortcut note if you just want to complete the tasks as soon as possible
You could finish the game in minutes once you know what you need to do
This is a very short game
Try to learn your way around Sevana and take notes on places
Pearls are the main currency in this land
You need at least pearls to be able to complete the game
Do not make too many mistakes inside the village because Arrikk could get a drowning punishment
Walkthrough Q What should Arrikk do first A Check out the window
Arrikk will see a big ship landed on his back yard
He needs to check the ship out
Exit the bedroom and enter the bathroom to the left
Pick up the notebook next to the toilet
He rsquo ll automatically pick up the reading glass also
Go down stair and head straight to the ship
Hmmmm hellip It rsquo s a huge ship
How could he enter this ship
A ladder might come handy
As for now try to get more information about the ship from the villagers
Q Where could Arrikk find more information about the ship A The couple that stands on the way to the main road cursed him for being a left handed man and blamed him for the stranded ship
Continuing the journey Arrikk will arrive at the main intersection
The right path will take him to the lighthouse the left path will lead him to the village and his uncle live at the house across the path
Take the right path to the lighthouse and he rsquo ll learn from his cousin the man sitting on the rock about the lighthouse
Out of the blue along with the presence of the ship the lighthouse works again
Go back to the main road and this time take the path to the village
Almost everybody in the village blamed him for the ship
He could also talk to his grandmother the woman sweeping her yard on the way to the village about all of these problems
Q An old woman asked Arrikk to get her a rush wool
Where could he get one A Received pearls from her
He could use one to buy the wool and one for his gift
Turn right and walk straight to the tavern
Turn slight left and follow the path to the wooden fence
The market is behind the fence
Walk to the second last merchant
Arrikk could buy wool from her
Give the wool to the old woman
Q Where could he find the village rsquo s elder A The council houseis on the opposite direction from the market pass through the two little kids on the street
The guard will not let him to go through though
The best way to meet the elder is by doing something wrong
Go back to the tavern and head to the path in between the tavern and the stall
Enter the opening on the fence to the right of the standing guards
This is the council backyard
Enter the council house and talk to one of the elder woman
No matter what Arrikk answer she rsquo ll summon the guards
The guards will bring him to meet the elder
The elder will spare his life and put him on the stocks for a night
It rsquo s time to go back home and investigate the ship
If only he could find a ladder
Note In front of the guard of the council house Arrikk could use his notebook to record the drawings on the four stones
He could buy a pork meat and give it to the dog at the council backyard
Q Where could Arrikk get a ladder A Talk with his uncle
Make sure he told him that it's not his fault the ship landed in Sevana or else you will not be able to borrow the ladder
Promise him to return it later on
Go back to the ship
Darn there are guards standing in front of the ship
He needs to find a way to reach the ship
Q How could Arrikk pass the guards of the ship A There are two main clues to solve this problem
First find your way to the council backyard Click on the opening to the left of the sharpener He will hear a conversation between the guards regarding the daily shift of the guard
The jester on the last stall at the market holds the second clue
Beat him twice on his game and he will tell you to get the guard uniform
Q How could Arrikk beat the jester on his games A The first game pearl in the cup is quite tricky
To guess the correct cup you need to pay attention to his hand
He rsquo ll make an extra forward move on the correct cup
The second game the rope knot is easy
Choose the left knot to solve it
The third game is easy also
Choose the elder to solve it
The fourth game requires your agility and quick reflexes
Note If Arrikk could beat the jester for the fourth time he will receive a deck of cards
It is not useful for this episode
Q Where could Arrikk find the guard uniform A It is kept in the council house
The back entrance could be found to the left of the standing guard
It is boarded
Arrikk needs to find a crowbar
Q Where could Arrikk find a crowbar A Enter the tavern and sit down on the empty table to your left
Order a rice beer
Do not drink it yet
Instead turn to your right and look closely at the barrels on the corner
He rsquo ll find a crowbar hidden behind the barrels
Use the crowbar to pry open the boarded window

Look at amulet through bottle so the red twines don't blurr the picture anymore
Then you can say the word written on the amulet and get strength for a few moves using one of the three stars on the amulet
Put the saddle on the pterodactyl and fly north wait if wind is blowing against you
Cloudy directions cannot be entered to get to the ruins
Use the vial from under the pew in the Chapel Jungle to get rid of the undead warrior
To get more dexterity squeeze moss in cellar or idol giving you each
To get rid of the monkey grinder give him the closed chest after you've opened it once to get to the implementors
He can't read To get the jewel hit the baby hungus wait for its mother to follow you to the maw of the idol
Get up and take the jewel whenthe hungus is on the jaw
How do I get out of the idol and get the jewel from the hungus
Use the eversion twice
Point it at idol and hungus To get more compassion use levitation on the baby hungus who deserves it after being hit by you
Sell the jewel zorkmids and buy the hourglass which can be used at the ruins under the arch shaped like an hourglass
Once under the arch turn the hourglass and you can travel through time
Take the minx and a truffle who has been in the pool of youth so it will stay fresh forever
Throw the truffle in the trench where the helmet rolls into and travel through time to the place called quot desolation quot and wait for the minx to dig up the truffle
Then you can take the helmet
Don't go back to the battle trench after that because history will start all over again and you'll lose the helmet you're carrying
Wearing the helmet gives you intelligence and armor class extra
Use the hurdy gurdy from the monkey grinder near the corbies in the gray field of Frotzen
Set dial to eye and close lid
Then turn the crank right until a farmhouse will fall down
Find the farm enter it and wait to get to a giant boot
Examine the flowers near the boot and choose the right key the one having the same colour as the third scarecrow after turning the hurdy gurdy
Carrying this key gives you access through the giant wall of corbies and you'll find a compass rose
The rose can be used to see in which direction the wind blows AND can actually change the direction of the wind
quot Set rose to se quot enables you to fly nw with the wind in your back cloudy directions are still unaccessable
You can use the palimpsest to go to the ruins as well by saying the word on it when you are on the ground walk to the location you want to go to once you're above the ground and say the word on the palimpsest again
Search the debris in the lamphouse of the lighthouse and you'll find a valuable sextant you can sell
To get past the Christmas Tree monsters you have to change the butterfly in a caterpillar using the hurdy gurdy
The butterfly will align on the rim of the goblet somewhere in the fields of Frotzen it's attracted by the nectar
Put the butterfly in the hurdy gurdy open the lid first and close the lid
Set the dial to clock and turn the crank left quot reverse quot time a butterfly comes out of a caterpillar normally now it's the other way around
Carrying the caterpillar the trees will avoid you and you can get through
Take the diary and the hemisphere along with the leaflet from the mailbox
The leaflet will turn into a burin needed to inscribe the glyph

Run away from the lava or you'll get killed
Wear the ring and enter the lava while it's still hot
Inscribe the glyph with the burin the glyph is written in the diary as well so read it if you haven't done that earlier without an example there'll be no glyph writing

Game Boomers Cheats and Walkthroughs for Boomers and the rest of you guys
Zork NemesisWalkthrough by Dan KennedyArpil Introduction Zork Nemesis was Activision's attempt at recasting its long running adventure series as a graphically driven game during the mid 's
Gone is the goofy humour and the kitchen sink think out of the box style puzzles that were the cornerstone of the Zork games instead we get a dark brooding eerie atmosphere and Myst style puzzles
There are numerous references to familiar Zorkian terms and titles but the laughing never really gets louder than a chuckle
The game actually comes across as sort of a Myst quot plus quot better graphics longer gameplay better developed story and more puzzles
Although never managing to capture Myst's uniquely immersive feel let's face it Myst pretty much created and broke the mould at the same time the gameplay is a good blend of story driven sequences and quot wandering around quot time
Where the game suffers is in the all too familiar story structure and quot good is bad bad is good quot characters
Nemesis is undoubtedly the black sheep of the Zork family a great engaging and sometimes gory game that perhaps tries a little too hard to be Myst
In fact Activision all but admitted that it had strayed a little too far from the essence of the Zork series with the release of the much funnier Zork Grand Inquisitor a few years later
Like other mid 's games that relied heavily on the best graphics of the day Nemesis suffers by comparison with the look of today's adventures
Having said that the visuals are decent and the game controls are simple just follow the cursor
I understand that some fairly detailed documentation comes with the game I did not get a chance to review it since my copy came from a cheap distributor
You can be killed in this game but only at a few select spots
Also you may wish to find and download the Nemesis patch which displays character's speech at the bottom of the screen
Goin' to the Chapel Intro movie stabbed guy murdered woman needs to be rescued everyone cursed future unravelled spiralling down into a dark dreary deserted world
Any of this sounding familiar
Once the movie ends you find yourself standing in a deserted courtyard outside what appears to be a church
This is your first look at the Nemesis cursor a forward pointing arrow indicates you can move in that direction
Wander around the courtyard a bit but there isn't really anything of interest here
You can see what looks like a city off to the right of the church
Turn around and click on the locked gate note how the cursor turns yellow over something that can be touched the chain jiggles but the way is blocked
Use the quot back quot arrow cursor to return to the normal view
Approach the building opposite the gate climb the stairs and walk towards the sun symbol on the outside wall of the building
Proceed to your left turn right at the corner of the building and move forward
You'll spot another sun on this side of the building
Continue along to the next corner you should now be able to see a much larger cathedral like building straight ahead
Turn to your right and follow the back wall of the small building to the next corner another sun symbol is found here too
Turn to your right and spot the open door along the fourth wall of the small building
Walk forward turn to your right and enter
This seems to be some sort of chapel or mausoleum
Walk forward several steps towards the candle burning in the alcove on the far wall and click on the flame
The vision of a woman tells us that quot they're in the temple quot Back away from the alcove and turn to your right to see a stone crypt
Walk towards the crypt and then click on it to see a red violin float around
Once the music is done move forward again and click on the note lying inside the crypt beside the violin
The note says quot I will be waiting at the Gates of Hell
You will not escape my wrath quot
Click again to put the note down and then back away
Look up hellip look WAY up Turn around and make you way back outside
Turning to your left walk to the corner of the building and turn to your left again
Walk forward and turn to your right you will see a clear pathway to the door of the temple
Three steps forward will take you right to the temple door
The double arrow icon indicates a spot where the panning feature can be changed from horizontal to vertical
Find the yellow coloured up pointing arrow icon on the screen and click to change the panning direction
You should now be able to look upwards at the top of the doorway
Click on the plaque above your head which reads quot When the sun and the moon are joined the entrance to eternity is opened quot
Back away from the plaque and find the yellow coloured horizontal arrow to switch back to horizontal panning
Click on the left hand door knocker for a close up the sun symbol is in the centre and the moon symbol is on the piece that hangs down below
Mouse over the hanging piece the cursor switches to an open hand indicating that the object can be manipulated in some way
Click and drag the hanging piece upward until the moon and sun symbols are touching as the plaque said the doors will now open
Walk into the temple as the doors close behind you
The front hallway of the Temple has a number of walled up doorways leading off that make an ominous thump when you click on them However there is only one doorway the leads to anywhere
Proceed forward one step listen to the threatening message from Nemesis turn to your right and enter the Library
Easy Reading You'll see book shelves in every direction some hanging screens to your right and a giant globe to your left
Ignore the screens for now and move to your left
Turn around and face the long wooden desk opposite the globe
There are accessible books along this desk that contain varying amounts of useful information
The left most book has some circular symbols on its cover and is a journal written in the same handwriting as the note from the Chapel's Crypt
We can guess that the journal belongs to Nemesis
The first pages indicate that he has killed four alchemists but must continue whatever work they were doing before their deaths
The facing page contains a map of the Temple I suggest you quickly sketch this map out
The library is located in the bottom right corner of the map
The rest of the journal indicates the following The next book is titled quot Astronomy For a New Age quot and contains some typical Zorkian gibberish and well as the pictures of planets
Four of the planets have names scrawled next to them two of the names were mentioned as alchemists in Nemesis' journal so we can deduce that the names belong to the Alchemists Sartorius planet Juperon Malveaux planet Saturnax Sophia planet Venusnv and Kaine planet Murz
The third book from the left quot Interview with a Grue quot again contains some Zorkian humour that players of other games in the series will recognize
The fourth book quot The Best of the New Zorker quot contains some interesting information on what has occurred in this quot Forbidden quot land
The fifth book quot Alchemy of Pure Love quot describes the mysterious fifth element the quot quintessence quot or pure love or Philosopher's Stone Harry Potter eat your heart out
The sixth and last accessible book quot My Best Excesses quot is written by Zork's most famous tax crazed leader Dimwit Flathead
Message in a Haunted Temple Turn around and walk towards the exit located in the far corner beyond the large globe
Before you leave the library click on the small table with the knife and crystal ball on it to the right of the doorway
Get a close up on the knife and click it again
Yikes what was that
Back away and exit the room via the corner doorway
You are now at one of the corners of the Temple's interior courtyard
Turn to your left and move forward
If you pan to your left you will see the entrance hallway with the front door visible at its far end
Turn back to your original direction and move forward again
Nemesis pings you with another message these seem to be magical recordings since he hasn't rushed out and finished us off
So far he seems very peeved with the alchemists and desperately wants you to go away
Turn to your left and enter the Lab this is marked on the map you should have sketched out from the journal
Black Lab You will see a red book lying on the bench directly in front of you as you enter
Click on it to reveal a photograph underneath and click on the photo to show a girl playing the violin
In fact it's the same girl that we saw in the Chapel vision
Back up away from the picture and pan around until the left side of the doorway is visible
Click on the dusty red book propped up next to the door frame
This book contains more Nemesis notes connecting each alchemists to a specific element Sartorius Air Malveaux Fire Sophia Water and Kaine Earth
Turn around and take a step to the right of the doorway
There's a picture on the wall to your left that plays some peaceful violin music to soothe your worries
Pan towards the centre of the room and take a step in that direction
Turn to your left and hit the yellow vertical arrow to pan down
Four broken shapes are displayed on the counter here but they only glow when you try to touch them
Back away and turn to the opposite direction
Pan downward again and check out the naked fella diagram set into the wooden counter here
Malveaux's name is scrawled beside a symbol that looks like an quot h quot with a tick along the letter's stem
quot May he burn in hell quot is written next to an inverted open triangle
Back away pan to the left and click to move towards the ladder
Standing directly in front of it click to go up the ladder
The only item that can be examined here is a sketch book located to your right
The sketches show four individuals doing various tasks could these be the alchemists
Back away and click on the downward arrow to descend the ladder
Make your way into the lab's back room
Pan a bit to the right and click on the papers on the writing desk here
The top sheet displays the relationships between the alchemists and their respective elements and metals
Symbols for each are also displayed
The rest of the documents mentions things like changing earthly matter into perfection base metals into gold and silver and mortal flesh into eternal life
Back away from the desk and turn to your left to see six recording disks mounted on a frame
Click on each of the disks starting from the left to hear more of Nemesis' notes from the lab
He appears to be torturing the alchemists to learn their secrets how to torture someone you've already murdered is beyond me but he's not having much success
Nemesis has learned four steps in the alchemy process sublimation distillation calcification coagulation but is missing a mysterious vital step
He's also left the premises in search of more riches and a wizard to help him
The Fountainhand Back away from the recording disks turn around and exit the lab via the doorway
Once outside walk forward one step turn to your right and move forward another step
Turn to your right and approach the two fountains in the centre of the courtyard
The ivory tusks on either side of each fountain control the water flow clicking on the left tusk turns the water on while the right tusk turns it off
The fountain to your right doesn't contain anything interesting
Turn the water flow off on the fountain to your left and move forward to examine the object behind the water
The object resembles a hand sticking out of the wall
Clicking on it yields a metallic clang and little else
It appears that whatever mechanism this operates is not functional as yet
Back away from the fountain turn to your left and walk forward two steps into another central hallway
There's a painting on the wall to your left that can be examined in greater detail if one so desires
Now turn to the opposite wall to find an doorway to the outside
Exit the Temple onto a large balcony containing a central gazebo and a sundial
Feel free to wander about but there's not much to see here
Note the other doorway that lead back to the Temple's interior courtyard
Approach the sundial near the outer wall
The dial has the alchemists' symbols on it as well as two others the sun and the moon
Grab the piece that creates the shadow in the dial's surface it looks like a paint brush and right click to place it into your inventory
Re enter the Temple building through the entrance you left by
Turn to your right and take a step forward to enter a cavernous room used for worship
The Living Dead Walk two steps forward and turn around to see the bodies of the four alchemists in their glass coffins
Approach each in turn and click on their bodies to get a message from each one
They all mention that you must find the four hidden elements and that to watch out for Nemesis
Once you've heard from all four alchemists make your way onto the dais behind where you've been standing from the centre of the room just move to the left or right and walk onto the raised area
Walk to the back of the dais and then forward to the round altar at the front of the dais
The top of the altar has the four symbols etched into it and well as a central depression that is empty at the moment
Our next step is to find the four elements that Nemesis has hidden about the Temple
It's a good idea to consult that map at this point your sketched copy or the map back in the Library
If you look carefully on the map you will see the alchemists' symbols displayed three of the symbols are located along the outer edge of the great room while the fourth Malveaux's symbol indicates that the Fire element is found beyond the screened wall in the Library
If you're not already there return to the Library using any path you wish there are several ways of doing so and you should be familiar enough with the layout of the building by now
Approach the screens at the far end of the room and click to get even closer
For each screen there are two choices click on the left side to move it left or click on the right side to move it to the right
Each screen will only shift completely out of the way in one of the two directions
Click on the left side of the first screen right on the nd screen right on the rd and left on the th
Blue Angel The screens peel back to reveal a doorway step through and find yourself in a torch lit corridor
Turn to your left and take two steps forward to find a familiar looking diagram on the wall just like the one on the lab counter
Mouse over the man's head until you get the open hand cursor and then click and rotate the centre disk
Remember what the symbol for fire was
It's the open upright triangle which is found in the lower left part of the outer circle
Position the centre wheel so that the man's head is pointed at the fire symbol and the door opens straight ahead
Walk straight ahead to the sundial and click on the right button to bring up the arm from the outdoor sundial
Click on the hole on the right hand side to place it there
The centre portion of this dial can also be rotated by grabbing the arm and making a circular motion
Remember how a sundial works rotate the centre disk until the shadow of the arm lays across the symbol
The sundial spins and a door opens along the far wall step beyond the dial and walk over to the door
Take one step into the room and pan to the right
Grab the mirror hanging on the wall here pan back and continue into the room of candles
The object here is to find the true fire element which is burning on only one candle in the room
That candle's flame is the only one that appears blue in the reflection from the magical mirror you picked up a moment ago
Note the six brass hooks above the candles to place the mirror on to reflect the flames place the mirror on each hook and look for the blue flame
The correct candle will be visible when the mirror is hanging on the first hook to the right of the doorway
Now how to find that candle
Obviously its on the side of the room that's reflected in the mirror
Use the configuration of the other candles in the image to find the correct one
Or if you're really stuck face the doorway and start counting candles along the third shelf from the top to the left of the doorway the correct candle is the th one left of the doorway
Click the close up of the blue flame and you are transported back to the dais in the great room directly in front of the altar
Click on the burning fire and then walk to Malveaux's coffin it's the second from the left
Malveaux has a clearer message for you Nemesis killed his daughter Alexandria and he wants to bring her back to life
Once you're done listening to Malveaux turn to your left and head off towards the back corner of the great room to go after Sartorious' air element
Proceed towards the side of the dais pan to your right and go towards the dark corner of the room
You should spot a large two story porch like structure in the corner with a doorway in the centre
Walk through the doorway into the room beyond
Star Power Move towards the centre of the room and click on the strange looking contraption to the right it's a table with coloured horns sitting on it
Click each horn to hear a tone followed by the sound of an element note that the blue horn emits a higher tone than the rest and the wind sound afterward indicates blue represents air
Note to self blue is important here
Back away from the horn collection and change to vertical panning to look down at the large star chart on the ground in front of you
There are a number of different coloured stars shown here but the wind element symbol flashes over the blue stars on the right side of the chart for a few moments when you first look at it
I told you blue was important
The object here is to make all five of the blue stars flash while turning off all of the flashing purple stars to the left
You can try solving this puzzle by clicking on various combinations of stars but to quickly get the blue stars shining do the following back away and approach again and then click on each of the twinkling purple stars in order from left to right
This should shut all of them off
Now simply click on the centre blue star and the symbol morphs into a bird that flies up into the air as a mammoth spiral staircase descends
Gas Regulations Walk towards the stairs and then click to ascend to the top
Enter the room ahead and approach the strange looking gas mixing apparatus
The close up view shows a set of five tubes leading into a mixing chamber
Levers regulate the flow of gas for each of the five tubes
Other than that we're not sure what's going on here
Back away and proceed to the left of the central installation
Turn around and look at the coloured disk on the side of the central equipment
Hmm hellip Circle around the back of the central installation and look at the similarly coloured disk located here this one has an air symbol in the centre
Continue around the equipment and examine the third coloured disk
This one's a bit different we've got equal shares of green yellow and dark blue with only half as much red on the disk
Back away and click on the glass mixing chamber above for a close up
Mouse over the small picture of the bug located just below and to the right of the glass container
Find the hotspot and click this shuts the blinds allowing you to see the colour of the glass inside the chamber and within the tubes
Walk around to the front of the equipment again and re examine the tubes
We've already got green gas flowing at full capacity the left most tube
Match the ratio of the colours to the third disk by turning on the dark blue rd tube form the left and yellow th tube gases to full capacity and the red nd tube gas to half capacity the middle setting on the red gas lever
Leave the light blue tube the th off completely
A cyclone will appear within the mixing chamber
Click to grab it and be transported back to the dais in front of the altar
Click on the cyclone again to place it into the altar and then walk to Sartorius' coffin to hear his message the one on the far left
He admits that the alchemists were not innocents but Nemesis is one really bad dude
Earthly Delights Our next target is Kaine's earth element
Back away from Sartorius' coffin pan to the left and walk to the right of the dais
Once you've walked past the dais turn to your left and take several steps straight ahead
Note the dome covered room located directly behind the dais we'll need to come back here later
Angle off to the right towards the back corner of the room you will see a porch structure similar to that which lead to the air element
Approach the closed door and click on each of the skeletal fingers to raise them off the door locking mechanism
The four alchemist's symbols are on the left and the corresponding four metal symbols are on the right
Click on the fingers again to cover up all of the symbols except the one for Kaine left most finger on the left side and the one for the corresponding metal iron the second finger on the right side
The door opens revealing a room with a spiral staircase leading upwards except that there are no steps
Walk up to the staircase and click on the lever located to the right of the entrance to the staircase
The staircase is actually an elaborate elevator that carries you down into the basement of the temple
At the bottom turn around and attempt to walk back up the stairs we can't get back up since there are no steps
Take a step away from the stairs and turn around to see a set of cogs and levers on a table to the left
Click on the red coloured gear on the right side to lock the elevator in place and raise the stairs on the staircase
You can now go up the staircase in case you wish to return to the main level before finding the earth element
Riding the Rails Facing away from the stairs walk through the doorway into the next room
Take three steps forward and click on the telescope before you
We get a close up shot of the earthen mask that is our goal
Back away from the telescope and turn around to see a set of stairs leading up to a raised area
Walk up the stairs and look to your left to see a four button panel and what looks to be a mine car
Click on the panel for a close up we've got four buttons with four different buildings displayed on them
Click each of the buttons in turn and find the one that displays the symbol for earth a downward pointing filled triangle the top right button is the correct choice here
Once you've clicked the button back away and click on the mine car to go for a wild ride
If you choose one of the other buttons your trip will end in death by whatever element you chose fire burning water drowning or air falling from a great height
Once you crash through a wall and come to a stop turn to your right and walk up the stone stairs
At the top turn to your left and proceed over to the earthen mask
Clicking on it transports you back to the dais click on the piece of earth to add it to the altar and walk over to Kaine's coffin to hear him mourn his son Lucien who he claims was killed by Nemesis
Play the Piper We have only the water element to find now so turn away from Kaine's coffin and proceed to the left of the dais
Take about two or three steps forward and then turn to your left you should see a staircase leading off to your left
Walk up the stairs and stop before the two doors at the end of the hall
Try going through one of the doors you end up coming back out the other door
Clearly there's something funny going on here
Facing the doors again turn to your left and click on the statue of the head playing the pipes
Three notes play out if you have installed the patch the words at the bottom of the screen will read quot Do hellip Fa hellip So quot
Back away from the statue and turn around to face the opposite wall
There are a number of knobs on the wall here that emit tones similar to those played by the head on the other side
Use your tremendous musical ear to figure out which of the knobs to hit in sequence
If your ear is not working correctly use your knowledge of musical notes you've all seen The Sound of Music what's the note sequence
Do hellip Ray hellip Me Fa hellip So hellip La hellip Ti hellip Do quot
Hit the left most knob then the th from the left and then the fifth from the left to recreate the statue's notes
That clicking sound you hear sounds like success
Facing the two doors again open the one on the right and click to descend the stairs
The door at the end opens to reveal hellip nothing
Use the special quot turn around quot cursor to well turn around and then climb back up the stairs
This time choose the left doorway
Walk up the stairs and enter the gallery room at the top
Icicle Works The room you've entered contains paintings on the wall an hourglass on a table in the centre and a window on the far wall
Examine the painting in order starting to the right of the doorway
The paintings illustrate the ages of Zork's existence
Moving from left to right an Ice Age a Prehistoric Undisturbed Age the Age of Fire and Lava the Age of Temple Construction the Age of Magic with a completed Temple and a Futuristic Age
Now approach the blue hourglass in the centre of the room
Click on the hourglass to trigger a mechanism that flips over to reveal a plush chair
You don't have to tell me twice to sit down
Click on the chair to climb aboard and use the mouse to turn so that the chair faces the window
Walk towards the window and examine the blue bowl a great container for some special elemental water
The view out the window shows the Temple wall and the grey skies
Back up to get back into the chair and rotate it around to the left two complete turns
As you go around the second time you may notice a short hesitation as you pass the doorway to the room
Keep turning to face the window and walk towards it
The sounds of hammering and construction greet you
We've gone from the Age of Magic to the Age of Temple Construction
The chair actually allows you to switch between the six ages of Zork by spinning forward or backward through time
Have a look out the window there still isn't any water in the bowl but there is a saw sitting on the scaffolding just outside the window
Pick up the saw and right click to put it into your inventory
Now back up and get into the chair again
What age should get us some water
We haven't seen any in the two ages we've already been to and there isn't likely any in the Futuristic or Fire and Lava Ages
The Ice Age sound like its your best bet
Turn three turn to your left and spin to face the window again
It certainly looks cold out there
That big icicle right above the bowl looks a little loose
Right click to bring up the saw and click on the icicle to knock it into the bowl
Now we must melt the ice likely the Fire and Lava Age
Get back into the chair and spin to the right two complete turns
Walk towards the window to see the icicle melt into water and then click on the bowl to get a close up
Finally click on the water to send you and the water element back to the dais
If you somehow mess this sequence up just go back to the Temple Construction Age to retrieve the saw and begin the sequence all over again
Four Heads are Better Than One Once you click on the water bowl to pour it into the water symbol on the altar the four heads of the alchemists appear above you and speak of the need to now collect the four lost metals
We must journey to the planets that each of the alchemists hail from to do this
Suddenly Nemesis shows up and tries to throw his weight around
The four put their minds together and somehow banish him away yielding a gold ball that they give to you
Walk off the dais to the left or right and proceed around behind it to the dome shaped structure located there
Proceed down the recessed staircase into the room below
You will find six posters of the gods that are represented by the planets Juperon Saturnax Murz and Venusnv as well as the sun and moon
Now click on the orrery the model of the planets and note the two levers on either side of the equipment
The left lever raises and lowers the central cage the thing attached to the centre of the model via an arm while the right lever controls the rotation of the model
Right now the model can be rotated but nothing happens since a vital component the model sun is missing
Grasp the left lever pull it up and then over to the middle right position
The cage that hung down below the orrery has now swung up and is accessible
Take out the gold ball that the alchemists gave you and place it inside the cage
Grasp the left lever again push it over to the left and pull it up to the top position
The cage raises up and places the gold ball in the centre of the orrery creating a model sun for the display
Travel to each of the four planets is accomplished by simply rotating the right lever until the sun shines directly onto one of the planets you will here a small quot ping quot when the planet is directly in the sunlight
Although it does not matter in what order the planets are completed let's start with Sartorius' cold Juperon and the Asylum
Rotate the right lever until it sits in the o'clock position and listen for the quot ping quot that tells you the planet is properly placed
You will now travel to Juperon
Be forewarned this world contains some fairly disturbing scenes involving blood severed heads and other corpse manipulations not for the squeamish
Record Keeping Once your swooping approach to Sartorius' Asylum ends you are placed on a small platform just outside the front door
Brrrr
If you ever need to quot Return to Zork quot heh heh you can return here and click on the glowing planet to the right of the doorway

Place the locked box from the refrigerator inside this box and then click near the top of the locked box
We get a close up of the lock tumbler but have no idea as to the combination
Back away from the tumbler and then the box and click on the yellow lever located just to the right of the box
This turns on a shiny blue light
Click on the box once more and part of the combination to the locked box is shown on the box's side quot quot is now visible we know there must be something further to this combination who every heard of a two number combination
The faint outline of what looks to be a key is also illuminated in the blue light
We're missing a head and part of a locked box combination so we'll need to keep searching
Before you leave the room check out the weird blood filtering machine along the far wall of the room to the left of the heads poster
We'll need to put something into the clamp above the filter later on

Head Games Disembodied voices crying for salvation bloodied cutting instruments perhaps a decaying body hidden somewhere inside fun for the whole family
Walk towards the equipment in the centre of the room yes this is the control panel for the guillotine you can see in the background
Hmmm hellip we need a head and we've got a method for detachment all we need is the body
Proceed to the right of the control panel to stand to the right of the guillotine
Looks like its seen some use
Turn around and face the wall of cadaver drawers
Have some fun by opening random drawers looking for something to hack

Give Yourself a Hand You've walked into another wheel shaped room with a doorway directly in front of you
Click on the electrified keypad to get a close up but don't touch it again you will be sent packing in a most unfortunate way
Instead back away and look for something that can be used to touch the lock without frying yourself
Turn to your right and walk forward
As you walk around the circular room you will see a number of quot displays quot to your left that consist of wired up body parts that jiggle and move when electricity is applied to them via the button below
On display is a torso a brain a skeleton and an arm with the hand attached
None but the hand will be any help here
Take out your axe smash the glass protective shield and then grab the arm
Walk forward one more step to reach the two doorways again and turn to your left to view the electrified keypad
Click for a close up and then use the arm to unlock the door apparently the fingers have been here before
Walk into the inner room click on the ladder once to look up and again to climb
Pushing Tin You arrive at the top and step onto a rooftop laboratory with two large pieces of equipment a sink and set of tanks to the left and a large gas mixing chamber and cylinders to the right
Approach the sink first and look at the tanks evidently something's not working because each has a red light lit up on it
Click on the sink to get a close up and click on the tap in the centre to fill the sink with water
Now click on the switch near the back right corner of the sink to drain the water into the tanks each of which now shows a healthy green light indicating they've been filled
Walk over to the gas mixing equipment you've got a central gas mixer made of glass a helium tank to the left and a spark switch to the right
Click near the top right corner of the screen to examine the oxygen and hydrogen tanks to the right of the spark switch
Currently the oxygen tank is turned on and the hydrogen tank is off

Proceed to the display room and open the th display from the left to access the communications panel
From the phantom victims in the dungeon we know five code numbers split troops infiltrate destroy verify message distraction and build bridges
We were also told that equalled retreat but since that doesn't jibe with what was on Lucien's easel dig trenches we can ignore that one
The only problems is that we don't know the proper order to make the commands
Let's have another look at that battle plan from Kaine's room
It begins on the left saying quot could build bridges if enemy is distracted quot then following the red arrows quot split troops quot and quot infiltrate hellip quot
This would place the order as distraction build bridges quot quot split troops quot and quot infiltrate destroy quot followed by quot verify message quot
Using the up down arrows on the device punch in quot quot and press the large enter button to the right
The old soldier's voice comes over the speaker and tells you they've won the battle
Leave the display room and cross the parlour and the front room to reach the front door
Click on the wooden door to receive congratulations from the old soldier
Click on the door again to open it and walk through
Heavy Fuel Proceed more or less straight forward about five steps until you reach the general's tank and get in you will have to pan a bit to the left and right to find the proper path
The tank has a control panel to the right with a control stick and a place to key in a destination code and a doorway to the left
The door doesn't open but there is a blue coloured tube to the left of it open it up to see that it is empty
Since the control stick does nothing its likely that this machine needs some fuel to operate
Exit the vehicle and walk back into the keep remember to pan a bit to the right or left to find your way

Approach the mould making machine and click to get a close up
The correct symbol must be displayed on the right in order to construct the correct mould
Build the symbol by choosing the correct squares from the eight on the left and then clicking the appropriate spot on the right
Since we know Kaine's symbol is the male symbol use the four squares across the top on the left side to form the image to the right
Click on the first square to the left along the top row and place it by clicking on the top right square on the display on the right
The second square from the left goes in the top left part of the display the third square from the left goes in the bottom left part of the display and the fourth square from the left goes in the bottom right corner of the display
Now pull the lever to the right and pick up the mould that comes out below the squares
Back away from the machine pan to the right and proceed down the passage leading forward
This is a good spot to save your game since there is a timed sequence up ahead
Get into the elevator at the end of the passage turn around and click on the switch to drop the elevator

Zork Nemesis Easter Eggs Egg type quot chloe quot w o quotes anywhere in game will transport you to library open book turn first page voila photo of programmer
Egg Game Boomers Cheats and Walkthroughs for Boomers and the rest of you guys

This is a hint guide for the game Zork Nemesis from Activision
Before we begin I would like to express my opinion of the game I think it is outstanding but it is emphatically NOT for children
In movie terms Iwould rate this as PG
Having said that if you enter with the right frame of mind it will draw you into the game
Seldom have I had such an immersive experience
Another warning is this The game includes the name ZORK but it has little if anything to do with the old Infocom Zork series For all intents and purposes this game is unrelated
Thus if you are looking for an experience similar to the original Zork series you won't find it here
If you approach Zork Nemesis as its own game which is not part of any previous lineage and simply acceptit as it is you will enjoy yourself immensely
One last warning In many cases the questions themselves are spoilers
If one of the headings made up is How do I open the purple garbage can then if you haven't actually FOUND that it would cue you in that you should be looking for it
Therefore it is advised that you use this document only when you are really stuck
One of the better hint guides I've seen is the DiscWorld hint guide which is organized with two sections
Both have exactly the same headings but the first has mild or somewhat cryptic clues while the second is extremely clear and explicit
I've decided to do this one the same way
It is impossible for me to structure this without ever giving away anything
However I'll try my best
It isn't giving much away to say that the game is organized loosely into three segments
The first segment has four objectives and you must achieve all four before moving to the second
The first segment takes place within the area I will call the temple
The second segment of the game also has four objectives and these objectives are accomplished on four other worlds actually other locations on Zork
The thirdsegment has only one objective
The hint guide below is thus organized by these segments
Within any of the first two segments the four objectives can be achieved in any order
The easy way to tell which segment you are in is to look at the prefs frame and see your score
If it is you are in the first segment
If it is you are in the second
If it is you are in the final segment
This document is organized in the following order SEGMENT mild cluesSEGMENT explicit cluesSEGMENT mild cluesSEGMENT explicit cluesEASTER EGGS AND POSTSCRIPT There are no clues for segment
You're on your own
There are seven main characters in this game
I will refer to them as Nemesis Lucien Lucien Kaine Alexandria Sophia Malveax Sartorius and Kaine Thaddeus Kaine
General comment Many adventure games have dozens of objects you must pick up and move around sometimes incredible distances
This game is not like that
There are VERY few objects you can actually take with you
There is a special mouse pointer which indicates either I can be picked up or Something can be placed here
General comment Many of the things you see have to do with plot development
I rarely mention those
This hint guide is intendedto deal with the puzzles which would hold up your progress in the game
Don't restrict yourself to just what I mention here or you will miss almost all the experience
This is not a die whenever you do anything wrong kind of game so don't be afraid to experiment
And take lots of notes

What do I do at the top of the Earth pavilion Heck of a view ain't it
What do I do with the telescope underground Sure is a nice view isn't it
Bet you're getting tired of me saying that aren't you
Why can't I make the mine car move Where do you want to go
Water Segment Mild Clues I don't understand these doors I've heard that time is circular but this is ridiculous
How do I make the doors work correctly Maybe the clue is musical

Read all six of them
You'll probably want to come back later and refer to them
The entrance to the Fire pavilion is also located here behind sliding panels
What should I do in the fountain courtyard This is a transit point to other interesting locations
It connects to the library the ruined deck Nemesis' lab and the hall with the painting
Try experimenting with the fountains
What should I do on the ruined deck Look at the sundial and get the spike from it
What should I do in the lab The only item which is critical is the scroll on the work table
The first page of it gives the symbolsfor the four planets the four elements and the four metals and also shows their relationships
This is critical to solving manypuzzles in this game so copy this page down explicitly
What should I do with the four crypts When you move to the lower closeup there are two hotspots
The upper hotspotallows you to correlate a planet to each alchemist and hence also an element and a metal
The lower hotspot permits you tolisten to what the alchemist has to say for him herself
This combined with one of the books in the library gives you a face foreach name
The upper closeup is not used at this time
What should I do with the altar The four objectives in this segment of the game will fill in the four outer holes
This will happen in due course
Where are the four elements hidden In one of the books in the library is a map of the temple complex and four planet symbols are written on it
These correlate to the elements you seek
This map is reproduced in the back of the tan pamphlet which was included with the game
I found an element and I can't leave the altar Before you can proceed you must watch an FMV sequence of the alchemist associated with that element
The correct crypt will be highlighted by a beam of sunlight
You must move closer to it

But a better way is to try hanging the mirror from each of the hooks
One of the flames will reflect blue
That gives you a hint as to where to look
Air Segment Explicit Clues What do I do with the horns Each of the horns makes the sound of an elemental force
Blue is wind purple is thunder yellow is an earthquake green is rain and red is fire
Also the blue horn is in a different key than the others
The point of all this is simply to tell you that blue is the color you should be striving for in the constellation puzzle in this same room
What do I do with the constellations The idea is to have all the blue stars on and none of the purple stars on
The easiest way to do this is simply to click any purple star which is on and any blue star which is off
If you keep doing this eventually you'll get it right and you can watch an FMV sequence
Why can't I move the levers You need to close the curtains first
When you are facing the levers move to the right of the platform and search for a hotspot just under the sphere
If you click it curtains will come down
This unfreezes all the levers except one which is permanently stuck

Levers and should both be full on
Lever should be off
Earth Segment Explicit Clues How do I unlock the first door You must expose the symbols for Iron and for Murz but no others these being the metal and planet associated with Earth
I can't go up the helical staircase In this case you must go down first

The lady won't let me into the auditorium Get the last poster out of Alexandria's portfolio upstairs and put it onto the board next to the boiler room door
Then get a ticket from the ticket booth
Use the ticket on the auditorium door and she'll let you in
I can't get into the boiler room You have to get into the auditorium first
How do I turn the lights on After you've gone to box C and seen the FMV sequence come back downstairs
You have to use the baton to cue the sections where the instruments are sitting in the correct sequence to generate the traditional fanfare

Rather it is more like in an opera house
Here is more or less what it looks like from above X X X PODIUM X The numbers indicate the order in which you must hit the hot spots
Since it is dark you'll have to hunt a bit to get them right
There isn't any hurry but if you screw up the sequence you have to start over

OK the lever in the boiler room stayed down now what You need to go back in the water
There's a door you can exit through down there
What do I do in the crystal room This is extremely difficult mostly because the background music drowns out the sound of the crystals and the place is extremely difficult to navigate
You're going to have to spend a lot of time here getting to know the place and where all the crystals are
Something which may help is that the background music is in the key of C There is also a map on the wall which tells about where things are
You need to find a place in the wall filled with crystals and get one of them
Toss it into the boiling pot and a large black crystal will appear
Then go to the large green crystalline fish and open its mouth and get the wafer
Toss this in the pot and the crystal will turn gray
If you do this in the wrong order it won't work
Now you have to play the notes in the proper order
The Music of the spheres is CDEBG but the G is the gray crystal itself
The other four are spread around the room you'll have to find them and turn them on in the correct order
Unfortunately a crystal only stays on about a minute so if you go too slowly you'll have to start over
Another thing which won't work is to turn one of the crystals on off and on again this is considered to disrupt the sequence

Zork The Undiscovered Underground Walkthroughby Andrew Egerton egerton intop net This is a FAQ that should get you through all of the puzzles in Zork The Undiscovered Underground the new text adventure from Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn
This is my first FAQ so please bear with me
IMPORTANT Should your lantern go out give it a good shake
You begin in the New Excavation
Mir Yannick the Grand Inquisitor of Zork has ordered you to explore uncharted terrain in the Great Underground Empire
Travel northeast twice and you will come to the Cultural Complex
Go north to the Convention Center Lobby and northwest to the Souvinier Stand
Try talking to the salesman there
It seems odd that there's another person down here
He's wearing a mask
Try taking the mask and see what happens
Ooh that was fun
I hope you remembered the appearance of that grue
like you could forget Now take the candy from the counter as well as the popcorn and postcards
Read the postcards
Yippee
Go north into the changing room
You'll see a wide array of costumes
Take the suit gloves and mask that look similar to the grue and head back to the Convention Center Lobby
Wear the costume drop the lamp and head north to the Convention Hall jam packed with grues
Take the hat glasses and shoes and get out via the south exit
DO NOT take the chute
Head back to the Cultural Complex and head south for the Hall of Science
Explore the adjoing rooms and don't forget to take the stuff in the Mud Forum
Look at the tree and take the tinsel hanging from it
Head back to the Cultural Complex and go east to the Theater
Head east to the backstage and open the trunk
Take the zorkmid piece inside and TIE THE TINSEL TO IT
ooh alliteration
Go back to the Museum of Illusions and put the zorkmid in the slot
Take it out and put it back in again
Neat you got some hints
Let's follow up on them then shall we
Go to the Hall of Adventure and use your sword to pry the sixth rib of the skeleton
Go through the door to the Janitor Closet and take the bug repellant
Rose colored glasses huh
D
Go to the stage and look at those footlights
Take the blue and red lenses hope you had your gloves on
and put them in the glasses
Go back to the Mud Forum wear the glasses drop your entire inventory and open the cover
Hold the button and observe the picture
This is the combination for the sealed door
put the model of the closest object in the circle next in the square triangle then pentagon
The sealed door should open
Drop a candy bar in the Mud Forum one in the Hall of Science and one in the Cultural Complex
Go back to the Mud Forum and go southeast
Drop your remaining candy bar and run back to the Cultural Complex and wait for the rat ants
When they leave go through the tunnel to safety and a Great Reward from the Grand Inquisitor himself
NOTE It is important that you have your bug repellent with you at this point
If not rat ants devastate the countryside and you get to see what the inside of a totemizer looks like

JESTER NOTE The annoying and semi random jester is similar to the wizard in Zork II and you should play accordingly
Save very often and restore whenever the jester messes you up
This is especially important since he will sometimes summon a giant bat to fly you off to a random location or turn you into an alligator
You don't always have to restore when he does something though
If he puts a clown nose on you remove it and drop it
If he summons a giant bedbug yawn to get rid of it
If he says that he'll see you in the funny papers wait for a funny paper to blow into view then take it
If he hands you a slate keep it until you need it

GAME BOOMERS hints cheats and walkthroughs
ZORK I Part One So you're all set for The Great Underground Empire eh
Okay but before we begin a few words about this walkthru
First this is not the only way to solve the game
It's just one of the faster ones
Second because there is no wasted motion in this game you will not be visiting all the locations
So you might want to play around with the game on your own for a while mapping out as much as you can without much regard for gathering treasures
Actually mapping is a good idea since if you make a misstep somewhere you might find yourself in trouble
Be especially careful to follow the directions when in the mazes a wrong move there and you could be lost for quite some time
Finally you may not go through this in exactly the way it's written because of the thief
He is a variable item in the game you never know where he will show up
Try to move out of the room he's in as soon as he shows up
But keep in mind that even if he does steal anything from you you will get it all back from him in the end
Okay
Let's start the adventure
You begin West of the house and your first chore is to get inside
So go South and East
Open the window and enter the house you're in the kitchen then go West into the living room
Get the lamp then move the rug revealing the trap door
Open the trap door turn on the lamp and go down
At this point some mysterious person will shut the door on you don't worry about that for now
Okay so here you are in the cellar
It's time to pick up your first treasure so go South then East to the Gallery
Get the painting then continue North to the Studio
Go up the chimney you can only fit with the lamp and the painting and you will be in the kitchen again
Now go upstairs to the attic and get the knife and rope
Come back down and go into the living room
Open the case and put the painting inside
Then drop the knife and get the sword
Open the trap door again and return to the cellar
Again the door is shut by someone you never will find out who's doing this but it doesn't matter
Now you're back in the cellar and since we're coming to one of the more dangerous parts of the game you might want to do a save here
Gripping your trusty sword head North into the Troll room
There's a nasty troll here with a bloody axe and the only way past is to kill him
So do just that Kill Troll With Sword
It will most likely take more than one attempt so keep at it and eventually he will disappear in a cloud of black smoke
Now drop the sword because you really don't need it any more and it will hinder you in carrying other more important items
Having dispatched the troll you move along East East into the Round room then SE and East
You are now in the Dome room
It's a long way down and too far to jump so here's where the rope comes in handy
Tie the rope to the railing then climb down the rope
You will be in the Torch room
Leave the torch for now you'll be coming back this way again later
From the Torch room go South then East and get the coffin
Return West then continue South to the Altar
There's no way you're going to get down that hole with the coffin and even the program will tell you that you haven't got a prayer
That's a hint folks Just Pray and you will find yourself in the forest again
Since it's daylight out save energy and turn off the lamp
Now head along South then North I know but it works
to the clearing then East to the Canyon View
Climb all the way down to the bottom then go North to Rainbow's End
Drop the coffin and open it
Inside is a jeweled sceptre
Get that and wave it
The rainbow will become solid you'll need to cross over from the other side later
Now Look
You should see a pot of gold
Get that and the coffin
After that go SW then all the way back up to Canyon View
From there it's NW to the clearing and then West to the window
Once in the kitchen open the bag and get the garlic nothing else just the garlic
Go on into the living room and put your treasures in the case
Now sit down and take a breather because you're about to do a lot of traveling
ZORK I Part Two Once again open the trap door turn on the lamp and go down
Watch carefully and you will notice that this time the door doesn't close
Whoever was doing it before must have gotten bored
Anyway you're on your way to the dam so move along North East North NE and East
You are now on top of the dam
From there go North to the Lobby
Pick up the matches then go either North or East doesn't matter into the Maintenance room
Get the wrench and the screwdriver then push the yellow button
Now return to the dam and you will see that the green bubble is lit
Turn the bolt with the wrench then drop the wrench
You have opened the dam and you will be coming back this way again to reap the fruits of your labors
However right now you're on your way to Hades so let's get going
Go South then down into the Loud room
Leave the platinum bar for now you'll get it later
Head West into the Round room then SE and East hmmmm haven't you been here before
Again climb down the rope
This time get the torch
At this point you can turn off your lamp the torch will provide light so long as you have it
Now continue straight South getting the bell then the book and candles from the altar
Go down the hole to the cave then down again to the entrance to Hades
Your candles will have blown out by this time but don't worry about it
Okay here's where you have to be careful
First ring the bell
It will become red hot and you will drop it
You will also drop the candles
Stay calm and do the following all in one command Get the candles light match light candles with match necessary because of the torch and DON'T use the torch or you'll vaporize the candles
Okay strange things happened when you lit the candles now read the book
Whew
The demons have been exorcised
Drop the book then go South and get the crystal skull
Now back North then up to the cave then North to the Mirror room
By the way better put out the candles
Rub the mirror and you will now be in another Mirror room this one is North of the dam as the other one is South
Now go North then West then North then West into the Squeaky room well I told you you'd be doing a lot of traveling this time
Make sure you have the garlic with you then go North into the Bat room
So long as you have the garlic he won't bother you
There is a jade figurine here but leave it for now
You'll pick it up on your way out
ZORK I Part Three Go East to the Shaft room
Put the torch into the basket then turn on your lamp and head North to the Smelly room then down to the Gas Room best not to carry any open flames here
Now you are about to enter a small maze so follow these directions CAREFULLY EastNortheastSoutheastSouthwestdown and you should be at the top of the ladder if you aren't may God have mercy on your soul
From there go down to the Ladder Bottomand then South to the Dead End for the coal Get that then return to the ladder top From there go upNorthEastSouthNorth and you will be back in the Gas roomGo up then South to the Shaft room again Put the coal in the basket and lower the basket
Now guess what
You have to go back through the coal mine again
So make your way to the Ladder Bottom but this time go West to the Timber room
Ignore the broken timber not useful for anything and drop all but the screwdriver
Now you can squeeze through the crack to the West
And here you are in the Drafty Room which is also at the bottom of the shaft
There's the basket so get the coal and the torch and move South into the Machine room
Open the lid put the coal in the machine close the lid and turn the switch with the screwdriver
Drop the screwdriver open the lid and get the diamond well no one ever said Zork was an EASY game
Now go back North and put the torch and the diamond in the basket
Squeeze back East into the Timber room
Get the skull lamp and garlic
You won't be needing the matches and the candles any more so you can leave them
They were insurance in case the thief came along and stole the torch before you could get the diamond
Now head East again to the Ladder Bottom and from there up and through the coal mine you know the way now
to the Gas room
Pick up the bracelet then continue on up and South to the Shaft room
Get the torch and the diamond from the basket turn off the lamp then go West into the Bat room
Get the jade then go South East South to the Slide room
Now here's a fast way back to the cellar Just go down the slide
Wheeeee
Then it's up to the living room remember the trap door is open now and all the treasures go into the case
Huff
Puff
Bet you didn't know you'd be doing THIS much running around
But don't get too relaxed there's still plenty more to come urk
ZORK I Part Four Turn on the lamp and return to the cellar
From there it's North ah deja vu
then East North NE to Reservoir South
Now that the sluice gates are open you can head North picking up the trunk of jewels North again to Reservoir North getting the air pump and North one more time getting the crystal trident
After that go all the way back South again to Reservoir South then East to the dam and then East once more to the Dam Base
Here you find a little pile of folded plastic guess what it is
Right it's an inflatable boat
So inflate it with the pump then drop the pump then get inside the boat say Launch and you're floating off along the Frigid River
Now just keep waiting until you see the buoy
Get that then East to the beach
Get out of the boat then get the shovel and move on to the Sandy Cave to the NE
You might want tosave the gameat this point since you have to dig here until the scarab turns up and I'm sure you don't want to get buried alive it's been known to happen
Okay drop the shovel and get the scarab then go back SW Drop the buoy and open it inside is an emerald
Get that then continue South to the Aragain Falls
Here you can cross the rainbow so do that
which brings you to the End of The Rainbow
Turn off the lamp then go SW to the Canyon Bottom
From there make your way back to the living room and put all the treasures in the case
Your collection is quite impressive by now but you aren't finished yet
Go East twice then North twice
Climb up the tree and get the egg
Climb down again and go South East and back to the living room
However this time you don't put the treasure in the case
Turn on the lamp and go down once again
into the cellar and North to the Troll room
Now you are about to enter a maze so follow the directions very carefully West this brings you into the maze SouthEast up and you find several items hereTake only the coins and the key and be careful not to touch the skeleton From here go SWEastSouthSE and you will be in the Cyclops room
The Cyclops is not friendly but you can deal with him effortlessly Just type in Ulysses or Odysseus if you prefer
Old One Eye will tear out of there right through the wall
In fact he will create a passage eastward from that room right into the living room However you don't want to go that way yet
Instead go upstairs and you will be in the Treasure Room the thief's secret lair
Now give him the egg and go back downstairs then East to the living room
Deposit the coins in the case then get the knife the thief needs a little time to open the egg
Okay go back West to the Cyclops room
Again at this point saving is recommended the thief will not be easy to kill
So head upstairs and use the nasty knife to kill the thief
Once he's dead all treasures in the room will be visible
This includes the egg a silver chalice and anything he may have stolen from you before
Get everything then follow these directions Down NW South West up down NE and you will be in the Grating Room
Unlock and open the grate watch out for falling leaves
then go up
You will be in a clearing
From there go South and climb the tree again
Wind up the canary that's inside the egg
A songbird will come by and drop a bauble for you
Climb down again and get the bauble then return to the living room
Put all the treasures in the case making sure you REMOVE THE CANARY from the egg and put it in the case separately
You're almost finished
Just one more trip to make
Now for the last time enter the cellar and go North
From the Troll Room go East until you come again to the Loud Room
Type in Echo and you will now be able to get the bar
So grab it and return to the living room
Once you place it in the case you will get a message
Follow the advice of that message and you will get a map
Take that and return to the place where this all started the mailbox West of the house
You should have no trouble getting to the barrow from there
Of course once you enter the barrow You didn't really think it would end there did you
Not when there's still Zork II and Zork III waiting for you up ahead
Ah but it's too late you can't turn back now
You'll just have to grit your teeth and follow through to the end with a little help of course
See you in Zork II

The Wizard of Frobozz is a lot moretroublesome than the thief ever was This is due to hisspell casting abilities
Therefore frequent saving of the gameis recommended
Otherwise you will be wasting a lot of timewaiting for some spells to wear off
Okay let's go Get thesword and lamp and move along South South South SW to theShallow Ford At this point turn on your lamp then continueSouth SE to the North End of Garden

These are the directions from the various other roomsto the Carousel Room Marble Hall South Path Near Stream Southwest Topiary West Menhir Room North Cobwebby Corridor Northeast Cool Room Southeast All right you've finally made itto the Riddle Room Now all you have to do is answer theriddle Actually it's a fairly simple riddle just enter Say quot A Well quot and you will be able to move on to the East which isthe Pearl Room Leave the necklace for now and continue Eastinto the Circular Room

Return West to the Posts Room and eat the blue cake Presto

Stretch a little thenhead NW into the Low Room Aha there's a robot here Tell therobot to quot Go E quot then go that way yourself and you will both bein the Machine Room I wouldn't be surprised if the controls tothe Carousel room were here
Tell the robot to quot Push Triangular quot There will be a thud in the distance something fell and theCarousel Room is now off
Tell the robot to go South and dolikewise You are now in a Dingy Closet and a red sphere sitsinvitingly just beyond your grasp Try getting it and a steelcage will come down over you uh oh
Not to worry however Once the cage is down just tell the robot even though you can'tsee him to quot Lift Cage quot Once that's done you will be able toget the sphere ZORK II Part Two Now getting back to the bucket may be a problem of sorts pushing the button has caused strange things to happen in the LowRoom So after going North and West from the closet into theLow Room you may have a problem when trying to go SE back to theTea Room Keep trying however and you'll get there sooner orlater Then go West from the Tea Room enter the bucket getthe water and the bucket will descend again
Get out drop theTeapot head West pick up the necklace then West again and NWto the Carousel Room There is a box here the thud you heardbefore Open it and inside is a violin You don't need totake it now so just leave it here for the time being

Now it's Southand Down to the ledge then West and North into the Dragon Room what would an adventure game be without a dragon
He's notone of your nicer dragons so be careful here Hit him with thesword then move South He will follow you Hit him a secondtime and move South again He's still following you and you'realmost where you want to be Whack the scaly nuisance one moretime and head West into the Ice Room
Okay the dragon followsyou in gets silly over his reflection in the glacier andproceeds to get himself drowned You can drop the sword now since you won't be needing it anymore As his body washes away go East and SE to the Carousel Room then SW to the CobwebbyRoom
Get the string then go back NE and pick up the newspaperand the matches Now move along NW West and West again intothe Lava Room Leave the ruby for now and continue on Southwardto the Volcano Bottom
Aha look what's here a hot airballoon All you need is a way to get it inflated and you justhappen to have the means to do that Get into the basket thenopen the receptacle and put the newspaper inside Light a match then light the newspaper with the match Make sure you keep thereceptacle open Now just wait until the balloon rises to theNarrow Ledge then quot Land quot Tie the wire to the hook and get outof the basket
On the ledge is a gold coin
Pick that up and headSouth into the Library Get the purple book open it get thestamp then drop the book You can ignore the other books theyare all worthless Now back North and into the basket again Untie the wire and wait until the balloon rises to the WideLedge
Again quot Land quot and tie the wire to the hook Get out andgo South Now it's time for a few thrills Put the string inthe brick then put the brick in the hole in the box Now lighta match then light the string
Now head North IMMEDIATELY There will be an explosion then you can safely go back and getthe crown But don't dawdle once you have it get back to thebasket pronto The explosion weakened the ledge and it won'thold much longer
So get in untie the wire close thereceptacle and wait until the balloon lands at the VolcanoBottom
Well you seem to be doing almost as much travellingaround as in Zork I and you aren't finished yet not by a longshot Go North get the ruby then East twice and SE to yetagain

Exit the Gazebo then move South West SW Drop off some of the treasures then go back NW North North North to the Lair again Open the chest and get the statuette then return to the Carousel Room From there due South to thestairway This is a good place to save the game as you areabout to enter one of the nastier mazes around
Go down thestairs and you will be in the Oddly Angled Room
Things are notalways as they seem here and the exact direction to go at thispoint is not constant Try East first and if you can't go thatway then try West Either way you should find a club Get theclub and from that point go SE NE NW SW Watch the roomdescriptions carefully as you do this the little diamonds onthe floor should get brighter with each move you make you areactually quot running the bases quot here If they are not doing this restore the game and try again
When you have done itsuccessfully there will be a noise in the distance Now youshould try to go either North or South that varies also Ifone way doesn't work try the other and if neither works tryEast or West There will be a staircase going down but youdon't want to do that yet so go Up instead and head North untilyou are back in the Carousel Room

Or is it After all there'sstill Zork III up ahead
Zork III Dungeon Master Well you've come a long way since you first stood by the mailbox outside the house in the forest
You've defeated the thief outwitted the wizard of frobozz and now you stand at the foot of the endless stairs ready to embark on the final part of your journey
So pick up the lamp turn it on and head along due s until you come to the shore of the lake
Drop the lamp and jump into the lake
Brrrr
pretty cold
so don't stay in there long swim w and then go s
Get the torch and wait for the number to change to quot ii quot then touch the table
My oh my
you're in a room from zork ii Room as a matter of fact
However you don't have much time to sight see so get the can of grue repellent then try moving e and you will find yourself back in scenic vista again
Now wait for the number to change to quot iii quot then touch the table again
This time you're in a damp passage
Drop the torch and just wait there until you're pulled back to scenic vista
Okay you're finished here so move along n to the shore and again jump in the lake
Splash
it hasn't gotten any warmer in fact you just dropped the can of repellent
So go down and you will be on the lake bottom
Ah there it is
but could there be something else there too
quot get all quot and you will have not only the repellent but also an amulet
This is one of those quot wonderful quot variable things it may take more than one try on your part to get both items
In the meantime you can't stay in the icy waters too long and sooner or later a hungry fish will come looking for you
Therefore it's best tosavethe game before you jump in from the wern shore
So if you die in the water or get eaten by the fish or picked up by the roc you don't have to start all the way back at the beginning
By the way this is the only one of the zorks where you don't lose points if you die
But all the items you've collected so far get scattered all around and it's time consuming to go look for them
Okay now you have the can and the amulet so head up to the surface then s to the sern shore
You can see a cave to the s and it looks kind of dark
In fact it is dark in there which is why you have the repellent
So spray the smelly stuff on yourself and go s and you will find yourself in a dark place
Go s again then e and you will be in the key room
Whew
at le there's quot some light in here
and by the light you can see a strange key
Lged the key then move the manhole cover and go down
Here you are on an aqueduct
Since you can't go back you might as well go forward
So just head along n and you will come to the water slide
Go n down the slide and guess where you are
in the damp passage
there's the torch so pick it up because you're certainly going to need a light source especially when you think of where you're going next
So from the damp passage hike along w to the junction then s into creepy crawl and sw into the shadow land
Here we come to another variable portion of the game
You will have to wander around in the shadow land until a cloaked and hooded figure appears
When that happens the sword will suddenly materialize in your hand and you will be able to fight
However since there's no way of telling when that will happen you just have to keep moving around until it does
At le you will get a chance to practice some elementary map making
also this is the most dangerous part of the game as the figure is quite capable of killing you too
so best tosavebefore you enter shadow land
When the mysterious figure finally appears attack him with your sword until he is badly wounded and cannot defend himself
At that point get his hood
The figure will then disappear leaving the cloak behind
Get that also
Now you have to get out of here and i can't tell you exactly how since there's no way of knowing exactly where you were when the fight started
However if you go ewards you will exit the shadow land at either the creepy crawl or the foggy room
From either place go n to the junction
From the junction it's w through the barren area and w again
You just can't wait to climb down the rope huh
well pick up the bread first then go down to the ledge
Well well a chest
too bad you don't have a key to open it
In fact there's no way for you to open it at all
But don't despair there's a way of doing it
Just wait around and someone will come along the top of the cliff
You may not really trust him but tie the rope to the chest when he asks and wait around some more
Eventually he will return and help you back up the cliff
He will also give you a staff which is what you're really after here
Take the staff then go back down to the ledge and from there to the cliff base
Trek s to the flathead ocean and do a little more waiting
Sooner or later a ship will okay now w w w n n n e e and push the s wall two times

From there w s s e e n and push the w wall two times

Now s w and push the n wall until it won't move any more

Then w and n Finally
you have maneuvered the ladder under the hole and now you can just go up and out
whew
okay you've solved the royal puzzle and you have the book so go n to the museum entrance then open the e door and get your other stuff from the jewel room
Then it's back w to the great door and from there back to the junction
Now e into the damp passage and ne to the engravings roam
Well we have here yet another of those variable events sooner or later an old man will be sleeping here
If he isn't there the first time you arrive walk around a little and return
When you finally do see him wake him up and give him the bread
He will eat it and then make visible to you a secret door
He will then vanish
Okay you're getting closer to the end
open the door and go into the button room then n to the beam room
Put the sword in the beam then go back to the button room and push the button
Now back n to the beam room and n again into the mirror room
There will be an opening in the mirror so go n one more time and you will be inside
Now don't let the long and complicated descriptions scare you
it's not really as bad as you think
First raise the short pole
Then push the white panel twice
Now push the pine panel and go n Okay so here you are standing a little too close for comfort to the guardians of zork
If i were you i wouldn't try going past them quite yet
open the vial then drink the liquid
While nothing seems to have happened you have in fact become invisible
Now you can walk n until you come to the locked door
Knock on the door and the dungeon master will open it and let you in
All right hang in there you have reached the end game
go n then w then n again
The dm will be following you
Go n to the parapet set the dial to and push the button
Now go s open the cell door and step inside
The dm will not follow you in
Once inside you will notice a bronze door in one of the walls
However you can't open it yet
something else has to be done and it will have to be done by someone else
So first tell the dm to go to the parapet
Then tell him to turn the dial to and then tell him to push the button
All right
the magic moment has arrived
unlock the bronze door with the key open the door and go s
ta da
finally zork is finished
you have survived all the perils pitfalls and puzzles and now you are the new dungeon master
