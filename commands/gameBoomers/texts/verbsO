Obsidian is a basically another Myst like game
The game puts you in a very strange but hauntingly familiar setting gives you puzzles which are tightly integrated into the storyline and make perfect sense but you are given no information as to the objective of each puzzle nor any rules about how the puzzle works
You are expected to figure out not only the solution but the objective and the rules
And as the game warns your rules do not apply
The bad news about this Myst clone is that it has the same problem that Myst does
There is very little replayability since the wonder and mystery of the world is gone so once you get through the game once that's it
And the game is short
About as short as Myst is despite being on CDs
I guess I'll just have to wait for Rivan Myst II to come out
I've broken this solution up into pieces
Parts of the game between specific puzzles will be a narrative like this describing what is going on and where in the game you are
The puzzles themselves will be broken into three sections the objective the rules and the solution
The objective will tell you what you are trying to accomplish at this location in the game
The rules will tell you how the puzzle operates
The solution will naturally give everything away
Each section will also be presented in a series of hints ranging from very cryptic to plain english
To avoid seeing too much of a puzzle solution you might want to set your browser's window height to be about five text lines or so
Disclaimer No outside sources of help were used to complete this solution
Only the manual and my experiences playing the game myself
Also there is a lot to see in this game
This solution just covers the puzzles and the essentials

I live in Seattle or just out side of it anyway and it is a very nice place to be
The point of this first area is not to sightsee
This is a puzzle free danger free area that gives you the chance to familiarize yourself with Obsidian's controls
I think it is a great idea
Anyway you're walking through the forest watching the credits swim through your vision when you see this large growth thing on the top of a mountain
Wicked
Eventually you get to your tent
Inside the tent is a personal data pad
It is hidden inside the right sleeping bag
Open it up and watch the video clips
Using the PDA is much like using a web browser The up and down buttons on the left take to the next and previous pages the mail button takes you to your mailbox the home button takes you to the main menu and the power button turns the data pad on or off
To view a clip or open a folder just click on the folder
When you are viewing a clip you can get back to the previous area by clicking on the symbol in the corner
The game forces you to watch all of the clips in the mail projects and journal sections of the PDA
The other two are not available because of network problems
They do contain vital clues but if you've been through the intro before you probably don't want to waste time watching them again
It is enough to start a clip and then end it immediately
Doing this you should be able to breeze through all of the sections in about a minute
Now exit the tent and head down the path again
You should hear a roar and a loud scream
If you don't then this means that you haven't seen everything in the PDA yet
Head down to the Obsidian structure
You're standing directly in front of it now looking at your reflection
After a moment the front wall will break away and you'll be sucked in
You'll see this scene with all of these little bots making tiles which eventually grow into a large room The Bureau of AdministrationYou start off in an elevator looking out over the world
The first thing you should do is look down push the elevator button get out and head for the information desk
You probably have noticed that the lettering is very strange
Well each letter is just rotated degrees
You can look behind the red door to your right for a demonstration
It isn't really necessary
Now to check out the booths
Each booth on this level is harmless and has some interesting dialogue
I suggest you check them all out
The booths in order entering the right area first are Hints Sources Travel Productivity Operations Mediation Bridge Repair Reception Bureau Hygiene and Rebel Control
And that leads to our first puzzle Puzzle BreakoutThe ObjectiveClear all of the bricks from the screen The RulesYou control the paddle in the middle of the screen by dragging it up or down
Releasing the mouse button will pause the game
When the red ball hits a red brick on the right of the screen it vanishes
When the green ball hits a green brick on the left side of the screen it vanishes
If the ball hits a brick on the wrong side it changes color to the color of the ball
Hitting the brick with the right ball will change it back
Hitting it with the wrong ball again will end the game
When you hit the ball with the paddle it bounces off
The angle is steeper the closer to the end of the paddle The SolutionThere is no perfect solution
Ideally you should try to keep each ball on its own side of the playing area
When you clear one screen you get another
The balls move faster in subsequent waves
The game just keeps going on forever there is no end
Now head for the Bridge Repair booth
There is no puzzle here but one is presented
You are told that to fix the bridge you need to get a document filed underStandard Damageand get it pre approved
Sounds simple eh
To get to the document area head back to the information deck but turn around
Head down the right ladder
When you get to the base of the ladder everything changes orientation
Weird
Now head up the other ladder
Notice that because there wasn't a junction at the bottom that you didn't rotate
So now you are back at the information deck but now the deck is on the wall
Get into the elevator and hit the button
You are now in the filing area
You need to find the document
Before you look there are other things to do
Head to the computer console on the right side
Look a message from Max
But it goes away all too quickly
Oh well
You can poke around the menu choices but eventually you will want to choose the Cloud Ring choice from the menu
A doorway opens up and you can walk through to the cloud puzzle Puzzle Cloud RingThe ObjectiveSpell a word at the bottom of the screen The RulesEach section of the cloud and the ring can be dragged to the bottom of the screen and placed in one of the six slots
The sections of the cloud spell cloud and the sections of the ring spell ring
You are trying to spell a six letter word at the bottom of the screen using the letters in cloud and ring The SolutionDid you notice any games in the computer that might help
There is one game in theWord Gamesarea called WordMixer which takes two words and gives you the longest word which can be made from those two words
Maybe you should try playing the game with Cloud and Ring Also notice that the letters which spell cloud are shaped like a cloud and the letters which spell ring are shaped like a ring
What is the area you are putting the letters into look like
The ground
Which is also the word you are trying to spell
When you have spelled the word ground head back out
Now head over to the console again because you still have to find the document Puzzle Finding the Standard Damage DocumentThe ObjectiveFind the bridge repair document filed under standard damage The RulesEach of the documents is filed in a drawer alphabetically
Just use the guides on the isles the guides on the drawers and the rolodex like device inside each drawer to locate the document The SolutionAs you may have noticed the document is not filed under either standard or damage
In fact all of the filing words are one word long
How do you file something under two words
Remember the cloud puzzle
Try playing the game using standard and damage
You get back tradesman
The document is here
Go and retrieve it
Now head up the junction to the light the original ceiling
Get up on the platform and pull the lever to the right once
This rotates the structure so that when you get off you'll be on the wall side with the cubicles
Head towards them Puzzle Getting to the Office of Pre ApprovalsThe ObjectiveGet to the office of pre approvals located in the far left corner of the cubical maze The RulesTo go through any of the doors requires colored cards
There is a lock on each door
The color stripes on the top of the device indicate the cards that you need to enter
The color stripes on the bottom indicate the cards that you will get back
Exiting the office area results in the loss of all cards
To enter the Pre Approval area in the corner you need three black cards
You start with two blue two yellow and two red cards The SolutionThe office map looks like this KKK XXXXX XXXXX B YR XXXXX out XXXXX lt KKK XXXXX K lt YB XXXXX RY lt B BY K YR YR V V KKK R BY BB B RY B XXXXX BY R XXXXX YR BB XXXXX out out lt XXXXX K lt YR XXXXX R lt BY XXXXX BB lt YR BB K B R RB BB V V V YY RY YR BY YY RY BB YY XXXXX B YR XXXXX BR YY XXXXX out out lt XXXXX YY lt BB XXXXX YR lt B XXXXX YY lt BR YR V out BWhere BB YY means you insert two blue cards and get back two yellow cards
B Blue Y Yellow R Red K Black Notice the upper right corner of the maze
You can go north and then south netting a blue card in the process
From the corner you can also go left then right to convert two blue cards into a black and a red card
To solve the puzzle get your cards and head for the middle entrance on the right side
Enter here BBBBYR are the cards you have head north BBBYYRR south BBBBBYR north BBBBYYRR south BBBBBBYR north BBBBBYYRR west KBBBBYRR east KBBBYYRRR west KKBBYRRR east KKBYYRRRR west KKKYRRR west YRRR and you're there
Once here you get the form stamped and you can easily exit out the side door
Now head back to the light fixture and turn it twice either direction and head down the ramp to the office of immediate action
Unfortunately he won't help you since his clocks aren't running
You'll just have to fix them
Head around behind him Puzzle The clocksThe ObjectiveGet the earth sun and moon to rotate forever without colliding The RulesWhen the puzzle is stopped turning the blue dial rotates the earth and turning the yellow dial rotates the sun
Turning the white dial changes the phases of the moon
Pushing the button resets the puzzle
Pushing the bug lever starts the puzzle going
If it runs a full cycle without crashing you've solved the puzzle
Otherwise the puzzle will stop when something crashes The SolutionThere isn't a straightforward way to solve this
There is a catch
The moon isn't there at all when it is in the new phase
Here's how to solve it
Reset the puzzle and start it up
Let the earth and moon crash
Now adjust the moon so that the phase is new clockwise times and adjust the earth so that it is centered on where the moon used to be clockwise once
Now start it up and everything should work just fine
Now head back to the guy out front and he'll tell you to come back in a year
As you leave you hear a voice that asks you to go to the light and turn it off
To do this just keep rotating to the left until the lightbulb becomes unscrewed
Then go get the document she mentions filed under orient militia which codes to limitation and back to the light and go to the one face that you haven't been to Puzzle The Select a phoneThe ObjectiveTo reach the commissioner's office by dialing his number The RulesYou turn on the phone by dialing the number found on the orient militia document and pushing the red button
The three sliders represent the three axes
Where they intersect is the location that the phone opens up to The SolutionSet the first slider to the bottom
Set the second slider to center of the bottom wall
Set the third slider to the center of the bottom wall
Push the red button Puzzle The Balancing RockThe ObjectiveReach the commissioner's office The RulesManipulating the rock changes the exit
When the rock is up the door goes to the ceiling
The rock can be lowered to the left right backwards or forwards
Each results in you having a different orientation when you try to go through the door
If your feet aren't on the ground then you can't get out The SolutionYou want to pull the rock down towards you
You are now on the floor of the commissioner
Walk around to the door above the bridge and talk to him
He wants you to come back when you are facing the right direction
Okay to do this head up the ladder on the left climb out onto the information deck
Then climb over the desk and onto the globe that Atlas carries
This will rotate you so that you are on the bridge and you can talk to the commissioner
You are now transported to the second phase of the game The SpiderNow you are in what appears to be a machine factory
And there is this beast in the center but he is tied down
You can wander around and explore this area there is actually quite a lot to see here but the interesting things are up the scaffolding stairs next to the big machine in the middle
The next four areas can be taken in any order so just pick a scaffolding and climb it
Each of these four areas relates directly to one of the four classical elements Earth Air Fire and Water and it should be easy to determine which one is which
Whenever you solve a puzzle the portal that you came through changes to this view of a starfield and you are taken to a central chamber
You are also shown a card of the scene you just came from
Match it up with the slot below the symbol for the element you just solved Puzzle AirThe ObjectiveUsing the cannon shoot the tornado The RulesThe cannon fires where you aim it
If you look down there is a small air hole which opens up onto a puzzle
For every ball in the light green area you get a red beam when you fire the cannon
Pushing a blower on the side of the square moves all of the balls in that line away from that blower The SolutionThe grid starts with all of the balls except one on the outside
You want to get the entire grid EXCEPT the center space filled so that you can trap the air in the center Label the blowers like this ABC M L K D E F IHGPush the blowers in this order EGDDCDFCCCIFFIFIFKIKIKII Then go outside and shoot the tornado
It will probably take a few tries
Earth IronAlthough there is a puzzle here some narration first
You start by looking at a scene showing several bots jumping down chutes and spitting green ore into a hopper
Then all is quiet
Head down the path to the manufacturing area
You arrive at a conveyor belt
There is a button there labeled with a symbol in green ore I'm calling that symbol Fore from now on
If you push the button you'll see one piece drop onto the belt roll down to the next section and bounce off as the door doesn't open
If you look at that compartment you'll see space for a cylinder and the following formula on the back wall Fore cylinder Delta what I will be calling that other element
Now head through the next door into the chemistry lab
You'll see a periodic table above the chem set a tape player to your left and there are seveal chemicals and a mixing chamber in front of you Puzzle Synthesizing Delta The ObjectiveCreate the chemical in the cylinder necessary to continue the manufacturing process The RulesLooking at the tapes and the tables should give you the following information To mix two chemicals put one solution in the left cylinder and the other in the right cylinder and hit the button in the middle
Hitting the button next to the left and right cylinders will empty that cylinder
The flasks to your left contain the elements R R Y Y but Y is missing and B B but B is missing
The formula for Delta is R Y
The formula for Fore is Y B If you mix two singles and they are compatible then they will join to form a double
Red and Blue are incompatible with each other
If you mix a double and a single then the two largest elements that are compatible will form a compound
Such replacement can only occur if the newer element is heavier than both of the other elements
A Y cannot replace anything in Y Y because Y is not heavier than Y The SolutionMixing two doubles will cause the largest two compatible elements to form a compound much like mixing a single and a double
The two elements left over will form another compound
You are looking for a mixture that will satisfy the formula Fore mixture Delta or Y B mixture R Y Since Y is in both mixtures it should stay the same
However since R is lighter than B Delta must be the leftover chemical
That means that you would have to convince B to join a heavier compound and leave R off
The way to do that is to have B and some other element be the two heaviest compounds
The compound in the mixture must have R in it also so you cannot use a B since blues and reds are incompatible
That leaves the mixture R Y
Mix R on the left with Y on the right
Take the cylinder and put it into the manufacturing chamber
Then push the button and leave the scene Puzzle Fire EnergyThe ObjectiveConnect the power of the sun to the tentacle plant The RulesWhen you click on a pillar the tentacle that hovers over that pillar stops moving
When you click on the sun a bolt of lightning shoots down and hits the five pillars in order
If the tentacle is touching the pillar at the same time the lightning strikes you hear a chime
You need to get all five tentacles to chime at the same time The SolutionJust set it up and make adjustments until they are all positioned correctly
There isn't a way of telling you exactly how to set it up except for the rules listed above Puzzle Water OilYou start in a large desert area surrounded by dunes and the ocean
There is scrawled into the ground the number
This area is largely an area of recognizing what goes where it is hard to give hints for so I'm warning you now that you should only read one paragraph at a time to avoid giving away the entire world
The first interesting place to head to is that small castle on the dunes
You'll see a scope there which has a dial
The two numbers look very much like they could hold that number on the sand so dial up and enter it in
You'll see that you've struck oil
Now the next area to be is the waterfront all of the way straight ahead
You'll notice an odd area of water where the waves don't line up
Clicking on a section of water will cause it to move
You have to line up all of the areas so that there are no seams
The water doesnothave to line up with the water that is not part of the puzzle
It is easiest to start from the far back corner and work your way forward
A large area of the ground has lifted itself up
Notice that odd pattern on the side of the ground
Make a note of it it is much easier to see when you are in or near the castle
Now head back to the castle itself but approach it from the opposite direction
You'll enter inside it
Turn towards the central hub
There is a weird design on the door
You need to make this design look like the one outside
You can move lines up and down and you can rotate them around they wrap around the edge
The exact order of the lines is Top line left twice
Drag the fifth line up to the second line
Drag the eighth line up to the third line and then left twice
Drag the sixth line up to the fourth line and then left twice
Drag the ninth line up to the fifth line and then left twice
Sixth line right twice
Drag the ninth line up to the seventh line and then right twice
Eighth line right twice
Ninth line is correct
Tenth line right twice
When you go through the newly opened door you'll see the area of the ocean floor where the land rose up and see an oil spurt there
You need to find out where that is
Return to the tower and head for the scanner
Scan north looking for a feature that looks like the area where you saw the well
This is at location
Return to the scope and enter into the device and push the button The completionYou are back in the central chamber
Now all you need to do is connect the points in the correct order
They will form a pattern that looks very much like the letter M When this happens watch the movie and then return to the factory floor where you will be transported to the next world The DreamlandYou enter this land in a large junkyard
Run down the path and push the button on the radio you are then taken to the big hand in the center of the junkyard
There is an empty painting hanging mysteriously in the sky and a junk plane on the ground behind you
The first thing you have to do is to get the plane airborne
If you go to the engine room you'll find the first puzzle of this area Puzzle The crazy mixed up bird The ObjectiveMake the plane fly by making the bird fly straight The RulesThe frames that make up the animation can be moved around and are shown in the order displayed from left to right looping around
The frames need to be in the right order so that the motion of the bird is smooth The SolutionThere isn't much here to say except for the exact moves that solve this puzzle Number the frame positions from left to right from to
Move to to to to to and to
Now head to the captain's chair look down and turn the key then follow the directions
You select a destination by clicking on the location on the screen
Since the most interesting place is obviously the frame in the sky select that
Hmm not a valid destination
Probably because there is nothing in the frame
We'll see about that
Head for the Statue that is the right blip
In truth the next three sections can be done in any order
The StatueYou enter the statue and climb up and up and up
Reminds me of the Statue of Liberty in New York to find a large gallery
Browse all of the paintings and eventually head down to the far end of the gallery
Then enter the door on the left and examine the printing press Puzzle The Printing PressThe ObjectivePrepare an empty canvas The RulesThere are eight pieces that can be slid around on the canvas
The yellow button will arrange the pieces into one of three configurations
The green button will print what you have and submit it to the robot artist
If two pieces are on top of each other they cancel each other out The SolutionYou are trying to obliterate all of the pieces
To do this start by taking the unusual piece and placing it in the center of the canvas
Get all of the other pieces out of the way
Next take the short horizontal rectangle and place it so that it overlaps the thin section of the previous piece
You should end up with two squares slightly offset from each other
Next take the other horizontal piece and place one end of it on the upper square
This should obliterate the existing square and leave you with a new square
Next take the vertical rectangle and place it over the lower square so that it obliterates that square and leaves another one below it
Now take a pair of triangles and join them into a square and place it over one of the squares
Use the other pair of triangles to obliterate the other square
Hit the green print button
The robot will paint a scene and mount it
If you flip the switch next to the painting it will transmit that picture to the frame in the sky
Since there is now something in the frame return to the plane and try to fly towards it
The plane complains that it is a non regulation destination and the plane is configured for regulation flight
Looks like you need to figure out how to make a non regulation flight
Head for the Piazza instead the left blip The PiazzaAs you get off the plane you see a building floating in the sky
As you enter you see a four by four playing area with a robot that wants you to catch your inspiration Puzzle Catching Your InspirationThe ObjectiveTrap the robot who gave you your original message about inspiration The RulesYou both are on a grid
You start at the lower right and the robot starts at the upper left
You take turns moving
You can only move up down left or right
In the game interface only moving forward counts as a move turning to the side does not
Before you move you can make one of the sixteen objects vanish
This prevents the robot from moving into that square
You cannot make the object that the robot iscurrentlyhiding behind vanish but this is a good way to find the robot The SolutionBelow is a series of best moves that will allow you to win
In general ignore the robot until you are in one of the four center squares on the board
If the robot is on the same side of the grid as you then use the solutions otherwise step onto that side of the grid
Key
free space space with object removed y You r Robot's current location n next move
To read the key you remove the object from the space marked with a and then move in the direction towards the n If you are on the same side of the grid as the robot then the robot can only be on one of the squares marked
The first pattern is a win the second and third both lead to the first pattern rn
Win

r y yn ynr After you have won go up the stairs at the back of the game board
You'll see a miniature version of the game
There isn't really a game to play here but notice the chimes that get made after each move you make
It is one for every space away the robot is
Now return to the plane
Start up the flight sequence again
Notice how the switchboard looks a lot like the game board
And notice that after you flip switch D the light next to D is lit green representing you and the light next to A is lit red representing the robot but won't stay open
If you open any cover that is like removing the object
Try playing the game when you win you'll be in non regulation flight mode
Select the Frame in the Sky
The plane will complain that weather forces you to use a computer pilot
Try flipping the large red lever
The plane says that it is missing a crossover chip that allows you to change control over to the computer
Need to go get that chip
Fly to the Church of the Machine the center blip The Church of the MachineRight inside the front door there is a view of the central area
There is also a small conductor
He will show you a map of the area that has curious designs labeled at the end of the halls
After you have looked at it head down the stairs and look at the large bot in the center of the room
It is located directly in front of a chip
When you climb inside the mouth of the machine a programming board appears Puzzle Creating the Crossover ChipThe ObjectiveProgram the chip by burning the three symbols into it The RulesThe eleven symbols at the bottom of the screen represents a program that the machine will follow
The first symbol is unchangeable the gets the chip and holds it up to the light
This only works if the machine is in the center of the temple facing north
The arrows instruct the machine to turn in that direction or not to turn at all for the straight arrow and then move one space forward
If the machine reaches the end of the north west or east corridor it will burn a symbol onto the chip
Order does not matter burning a symbol twice will not hurt
If the robot stands next to one of the statues in the southern area it will adjust its program exactly as if the human pilot had entered the key that is next to each symbol
The direction the machine faces is not important
If the robot ever runs into a wall or executes the chip program without being at home the program will end and the chip will be erased
The program always starts with both the green cursor and the instruction pointer at the beginning
Every time the program reaches the end both the cursor and the pointer are reset to the start and the program resumes
Pulling the lever in the corner will start the program
Pulling it again will abort the program and reset everything The SolutionThere are no enough slots to simply walk to all three sides of the temple and return back
And if you don't change the program there won't be any way of getting all three symbols
What you have to do is get one symbol then edit the program so that you are ready to get the next symbol
You can get the first symbol by using the instructions Right Forward U Turn Forward Left
This will leave you facing south
Getting another symbol would start with the instructions Left Forward U Turn Forward Right
Notice that these patterns are exactly the same except for the first and last instruction
If after you executed these instructions you went into the south area and visited the Next Down Next and Up re programming statues that would change the first instructions to go from one direction to another
The first next moves the cursor from the Chip code to the first direction
Down changes Right to Straight and then to Left
Next skips to the last code
And Up changes the Left to Straight and then to Right
Then head back north so that you are in the right position
This sequence of instructions is Chip Right Straight U Turn Straight Left Left Right Right Right Straight
After you run the program get the chip and place it in your ship
There is a place labeled insert to the right of the door to the engine where it can be placed
Now you should be able to give the computer pilot control enter non regulation flight and select the Frame as the destination ParadiseYou enter this world on this wild pathway
Head down the pathway though the green door and continue straight at the junction
You'll hear Max call out to you at this point but the path to him seems blocked Puzzle The Path to MaxThe ObjectiveReach Max by positioning the pieces to form a continuous path The RulesThere are three horizontal pieces and three vertical pieces
When you move pieces up and down only the vertical pieces move
When you move left or right only the horizontal pieces move
If a piece is blocked by another piece or at the end of the play area the piece will not move The SolutionMake the following moves Up three times
Left seven times
Right four times
Up once
Right twice
Down twice
Right once
Now head down the path
Max seems in pain
Look down and remove the cylinder of chemical and pour it into one of the tubes to the left or right
He'll tell you to head back to the keypad at the location where you came in
Run back there and work on the last puzzle Puzzle The KeypadThe ObjectiveMake the manual override switch visible by pushing the eight keypad buttons The RulesThere are eight real buttons and eight phantom buttons
If you push a real button it lights up
If you push a phantom button it resets the keypad and all of the phantom buttons move one square The SolutionHit buttons at random until you hit a phantom button
When it does try to watch to see which eight buttons are the phantom buttons
Then hit the other eight
You now go through the endgame
You can either flip the switch back or do nothing during the five second countdown
The two ending are both short and disappointing
I wish the ending was as thorough as the rest of the game but given the choice between endgame animation and gameplay I prefer gameplay
Enjoy and wait for the next Myst like game
GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
OBSIDIAN Observations and Personal Commentary This game was copyrighted in so it is pretty ancient in the fast advancing field of computer software particularly considering a probable minimum of two years for development
It was written for Windows and many such games do not play well on software upgrades however I have played it with few problems on Windows SE and flawlessly on Windows XP
Insofar as content goes it is among the very best of the Adventure game genre and well worth the struggle to get through should a problem be encountered
It is a linear game the only deviation being the four gates of the Spider Realm which may be accessed in any order
The graphics are top notch and the action is not overly outlandish if you keep in mind that after the beginning in the woods it is all done in dreams
The story takes place some years in the future and is the familiar one of a computer being created to do a job with the ability to modify its programming as it learns by doing then goes beyond its creator's intention and starts a destructive takeover
The only real fault that I have with this superb game is that much of the dialog is incomprehensible particularly Ceres and sometimes Max
Inasmuch as the vidbots of the Bureau Realm and the cockpit announcements of the Inspiration Realm are completely understandable I find this unintelligible speech inexcusable
The game has two endings and in each there are final comments that I cannot understand perhaps others can I suspect they are relevant to these endings and I find it frustrating to not know what they are
Inventory is no problem
There are only a few items that go there and only one at a time
When they are there they are always visible and do not remain long Cursors are more than adequate The prudent Adventure gamer stores games often and these are kept in a standard Windows folder using any description you choose since storage is alphanumeric it is suggested that you use prefixes to keep the stored games sequential It is a good idea to scan the Readme since it contains a few dos and don'ts
The attached walkthrough is accompanied by several diagrams and screenshots though it is written so that you do not need to use them you will find them to be a great help
There is no specific reference to them in the text but if you glance through them first you will recognize the subject matter when you come to it
A couple contain spoilers but for the most part these addenda should prove quite helpful even if you are not using the walkthrough
An extra copy of the Bureau Realm diagram is included in case you would like to cut it out and fold it to assist in visualization of that peculiar arrangement
I cannot help but wonder why the Statue Realm was given that name
SorenAndersen May OBSIDIAN A Walkthrough by Soren Andersen In the period from to Lilah Kerlin and Max Powers have been using nanotechnology in a project they have code named Ceres it is to clear the world of atmospheric pollution which has become dangerously bad
The project is a success with a satellite in orbit performing this job and Lilah and Max are on a well earned vacation in the wilderness of the Olympic Peninsula in the state of Washington which is where the game begins in a rocky clearing among the trees
Campsite Follow the only path from this clearing and you are led to the mysterious dynamic black rock that Lilah and Max have been calling Obsidian
After gazing at this rock and seeing it grow a bit look down and continue on the path that eventually takes you to their campsite
Enter the tent and pull down the cover of the sleeping bag on the right where you will find Lilah's Personal Digital Assistant PDA
Open it turn on the power and after passing a security check there is a warning of two unauthorized remote entries into the PDA
Read everything that you can which will be Mail Journal and Projects
Everything else is quot temporarily unavailable quot this means among other things that the two of them are isolated and have no communication with the rest of the world
Pay close attention to what you read and hear as it will provide background and references to upcoming sequences
There are several mentions of Ceres nanotechnology and a hard wired non programmable crossover chip for return of the satellite to human control
Of particular note are the dreams of Lilah and Max
Somewhere in the material that you read a flag is set for game continuation so be sure to read it all
Close the PDA and exit the tent
If you turn left toward Obsidian and if you have read everything in the PDA you will hear a loud rumbling followed by a male scream presumably from Max
Hurry forward and you will end up at the Obsidian rock looking at a portal that faintly reflects a female image
Max's cap is lying on the ground at the left
The PDA security check its contents and this reflection show that you are playing the game in the person of Lilah
Bureau Realm After a very short period the portal collapses and you Lilah are drawn into Obsidian
There follows a long peculiar video could these be Ceres nanotech robots at work
At the conclusion of the video a man in the distance welcomes you to the Regional Administration Facility RAF and says he is the Bureau Chief
Note details of the mural in which he is located
He wants to see you over there right away and says he will extend a bridge so you can go to him
When he attempts to do this however the bridge strikes a globe in the middle of the room and becomes stuck
The Bureau Chief suggests that you can repair the bridge quot if you go through the proper channels quot
You are in the Bureau Realm
Atlas Face As in Lilah's dream that she recorded on the PDA you are inside a cube in which each of the six faces have tasks for you to do in your quest to get to the Bureau Chief
Right now you are in an elevator look down and press the button that takes you down to the cube's Atlas face so named because in the center is the classic statue of Atlas supporting a globe which is the one that the bridge ran into
Move ahead to an information desk and a TV monitor comes forward telling you to quot RING BELL quot
When you do this the clerk in the monitor a video robot or vidbot tells you that the Bureau Chief has information about Max and that you had better hurry and get the bridge repaired because the Chief does not like to be kept waiting
She further says that you should be able to get bridge repair information in one of the booths that you can see on either side of the Atlas statue
You will have noted that the information sign is spelled in rather weird characters
Should you wish to learn more about this alphabet turn right to see a red door in the far wall
Go through the door to find a book of letters and a guitar playing mannequin that will show you the alphabet
Of the ten information booths on the Atlas face the only one that you need is the one with the Bridge Repair sign but it is very interesting to go to all ten to see what the vidbots in them will tell you
In addition opposite the Travel booth there is a non illuminating display commemorating the Atlas statue pressing a button on the display provides you with a short lecture about a suppressed rebel movement against bureaucracy pockets of which still remain
As you move around you will see on the back wall where the Bureau Chief's office is the shadow of the partially extended bridge thrown by the ceiling light that provides most of the illumination in this RAF cube
At the Bridge Repair booth you will get instructions on what to do next remember this is a bureaucracy and you pick up a document repeating these instructions
You are supposed to find the document that is filed under Standard Damage so you have to go to the Records face where the files are kept
Back off from the booth turn left and proceed through the swinging gate to the edge of the Atlas face where you will find the transition to the sunken library that is in the Records face
Records Face Go down this slide like structure to the library floor and your gravity is reoriented with appropriate sound effects with the library floor now being down
Go left and move to a sort of backlit ladder among the books on the left side of the library
Climb this ladder to the top of the bookshelf then move left along it to the elevator now on its back because of the gravity reorientation
When you push the red UP button instead of going up it will move horizontally to the middle of the Records face
Here you will find eight file cabinets each with twenty drawers full of documents the range of each cabinet contents are listed alphabetically on the ends
But now you run into a snag when you locate the drawer SPRA STAR that is supposed to contain the Standard Damage file there is no such file nor will you find it under Damage Standard
If you randomly examine documents in the folders you will find that none of the documents in them match the folder name and in fact they are pretty much nonsense
How you now locate the Standard Damage document defies logic but this is after all a dream
On each side of the central aisle at the ends of one of the four file cabinets are computers go to either one of them where you may get a message from Max
If so the standard computer program takes over before you can get anywhere with him but at least you know he is around somewhere
The program welcomes you to the Bureau Network and tells you to press your computer keyboard Enter key and when you do that you get a list of available functions
You may try any or all of these by entering the number on your keyboard and pressing Enter but only the last two are effectively responsive
Number Cloud Ring is something of a diversion and does not need to be considered to advance the game
If you do activate number the computer morphs to a tunnel and when you pass through you are in a pastoral landscape with fluffy clouds hills in the distance and floating brass rings
The largest of these rings is in four segments and when dragged downward the segments morph to the letters r i n and g Likewise the five segments of the cloud floating through the ring may be dragged down to form the letters c l o u and d all to the accompaniment of pleasant musical sounds
If you pull the letters to the bottom of the screen they will remain there until you pull them back up but neither set will fill the six available spaces
If you now return through the tunnel to the computer press Enter and try Play a Game you get a choice of three Good Games Dumb Games and Word Games
The first of these presents actual games in which the computer gets smarter as you play but they do not advance Obsidian
The second choice the computer considers to be just that dumb games and goes no further with them
Choosing Word Games presents you with two more choices Hangman is considered a misfiled dumb game so you are left with WordMixer in which you are to determine the longest word that may be formed from two other words
After you enter two words the computer asks you to go first enter either of the two words as a wrong answer and the computer will then give you the correct one
If you use the wordscloudandring you will get back the wordsduringandground both characters that fit the Cloud Ring puzzle spaces
Return to this puzzle nothing happens if you drag down letters from the cloud and ring to formduring but if you formgroundthe scene becomes animated with the ring passing by and rain coming from the cloud
That's all it just keeps repeating so leave back through the tunnel
Nothing is accomplished gamewise but it serves as an illustration try the wordsStandardDamagein the WordMixer game and you will get back the wordtradesman
Now go into the files and undertradesmanyou will find the Standard Damage document
Click on it and it goes to your inventory at lower screen right
Two things are evident here with a little thought you could have come up with the wordgroundwithout using WordMixer particularly in light of the location of the formed word and the other is that you could have used Standard Damage in WordMixer without doing the Cloud Ring puzzle
Incidentally if you wish to play around with this game you may supply any two words to get longest single word s results
Well you have the document you need now according to your instructions you must take it to Pre Approval to get it stamped
Pre Approval is in the Security Face
The ceiling of the Bureau Realm with reference to the Atlas face is the Nexus face which consists of a turntable and four of the face transition slides
There is one of the latter at the back of the Records face that will take you up to the Nexus face
Here you operate the handle lever that rotates the turntable until you can lookstraight downat the Security face and can go down to it
Security Face Most of the center of the Security face is a maze of nine interconnected cubicles and with a corridor running around the perimeter of them
For reference number the cubicles left to right from to starting with the front row that you are facing this puts Pre Approval in cubicle in the back row on the left
You are met by a very friendly vidbot who gives you a set of colored entry cards she also asks a favor when you get to the Bureau Chief
You open doors between cubicles by inserting cards in card machines next to the doors
The colors of the cards needed are indicated on the machines you will get cards of a different color back from the machine the color of these cards also indicated on it
You usually need two cards to open a door and you usually get two cards back though this is by no means always the case
The major exception is for the Pre Approval cubicle to enter here you need three black cards and of course you get none back because once you get in and get your document stamped you are through and can leave
Any time you leave an outer cubicle and go into the corridor you lose all your cards and if you wish to get back in you must get another card set from the vidbot at the entrance
Each time you go back to her she is less affable
One way to attack this problem is to make a map of the cubicles with indications of the card exchanges at each machine then starting at Pre Approval you can work your way backward to a to a cubicle entrance from the corridor where you can then use the cards to proceed along the path that you have selected
There are actually several paths that will work
Here is a hint a short relatively path involves collecting black cards by much back and forth movement between cubicles in the right rear area
Another path is given in the User's Manual
There is a vidbot in each cubicle and it is from him her that you learn the cubicle function
You do not have to talk to these vidbots to get through the maze but it is sometimes amusing to do so and you might get directions on where to go next
There is a lot of nonsense involved
Of course you do have to talk to the vidbot in Pre Approval to get your document stamped which she does and then tells you to take it to Immediate Action and they will get right on it
Time Face Immediate Action is in the Time face so it is back up the face transition slide to the Nexus face where you rotate the turntable until you can lookstraight downat an area where there are six rows of curved benches
At the bottom of the slide head for the booth that you can see in the center of the face that is now your new floor
There a vidbot will give you a welcoming speech look at your paperwork and tell you that it is in good order
However he further tells you that his clock has stopped and he cannot process you through until it is running again
The hands on all the clock faces next to him are stationary
Go around to the back of the booth where the clockworks are
This is an interesting set of works
The sun and moon are in orbits and the earth rotates around a post
To the left is a large floor lever that sets the works in motion
To the right is a control post that has dials to initially set each and a dial reset button at the bottom
Push the reset button to be sure all are in an initial zero position all dial indicators pointed upward and pull on the lever to start things off
Ticks are heard the sun and moon move in increments around their orbits and the earth likewise about its post
After only ticks the earth and moon collide and the clockworks stop
You will have to make adjustments to the initial positions until a collision does not occur
This initial adjusting is done using the dial controls on the post
Examination and trial of the post dials will show that the top dial is for the sun and has positions the second dial is for the moon and has positions and the third dial is for the earth and has positions
This gives possible initial positions
The dials may be rotated in either direction and you will find that they are very sensitive and are best adjusted by tapping the mouse button and closely observing the dial pointer
You have found that the dial positions set to will not give the desired result of continuous movement with no collisions
The thing to do is methodically make an incremental change in one of the orbits to get a new initial combination and set the works in motion again
Repeat until there are no collisions
A table is the best method of keeping track of this process
You will not have to make trials because two in which there are no collisions will be found before are made
Another reason is because such a table has already been constructed
You will note in the table that trials and result in continuous clockwork operation so set the dials clockwise to the indicated positions of either of these trials and pull the lever
Correctly done the clockworks keep ticking away
Go back to the vidbot in the booth
The clock face hands are spinning wildly
The vidbot starts to talk to you when he is replaced by Max who seems confused and after a short period fades away
The vidbot says there has been a short malfunction then reexamines the Bridge Repair document finds it in order then announces another problem because of the stopped clock a huge backlog has built up
Come back in a year he says by which time he will be able to process the order
He then abruptly closes the operation booth without returning your document
Seems to be an impasse
As you turn away from the booth a female voice is heard telling you that the bureaucracy will never help but she can
You are to meet her at the light
This must be the light bulb in the Nexus face turntable so go back up there
It was the correct choice because she speaks to you again saying that she knows how to get to Max but quot turn out the light or they will see us quot
How to do that
Unscrew the bulb
Keep repeatedly pulling the lever to the right rotating the turntable and the bulb until the light goes out
The speaker now appears in a misty vision with some words about being one of the rebels and joining her group but the main thing she tells you is that you will find the document you really need filed under Orient Militia so it's back down to the Records face again
Records Face You know better than to look in that file drawer
Go to the computer and play WordMixer withOrient Militia which will give youLimitationas the file where you should look
When you do that you will get a document called Selectaphone Dialing Procedure
On the right side of this sheet is a drawing that is clearly three sides of the RAF cube around which you are being led
Here the Boss's Office is indicated on the Executive face the only one where you have not yet been and where you have been trying to go ever since you entered the RAF
Lines are leading to it from another diagram on the left that could represent a phone
Maybe this is an indication that you should now try to go to that face
Executive Face Return to the Nexus face and rotate the turntable until you have the transition set so you can gostraight downto the Executive face the sky mural with the boss's office in the center
At the bottom of the slide is the device shown on the left side of the Selectaphone Dialing Procedure document
On the document itself below the diagram of this device is stated quot Choose call destination by placing sliders in appropriate axes quot
The sliders are the red lines on the three slanting rectangles in which are green outlines that indicate the six sides of the RAF cube
If you click on the circles above the large red button so that the digits are in the circles as shown on the diagram you will get a better picture of the six RAF faces in the rectangles though the initial outlines are adequate
You want to talk to the Bureau Chief to find out what he can tell you about Max
The instructions say to move the sliders to designate the call destination
The document shows an isometric view of the Executive Security and Atlas planes each being in a different one of the slanting rectangles so it is a good bet that those are the ones in which to place the sliders all on the bottom halves of the rectangles
You have some three dimensional geometric visualization to do now
Regard the isometric view on the Dialing Procedure document the third slanting rectangle indicates that the slider referenced to the isometric Executive face runs vertically in that diagram and can be moved left and right the second slanting rectangle indicates that the slider referenced to the isometric Security face runs horizontally and can be moved up and down the first slanting rectangle indicates that the slider referenced to the isometric Atlas face runs left and right and can be moved forward and backward
Consider these sliders to define planes that are normal perpendicular to the faces in which they move
If you move the Executive face slider to the center of its face and the Security face slider to the center of its face then the two normal planes intersect to define a line above the Atlas face that runs through the Chief's office
The Atlas face normal plane intersects this line and defines a point on it
Where do you want this point which is the dialing destination
In the Chief's office so move the Atlas face slider all the way back the Executive face
This visualization is done while regarding the isometric view but of course the sliders are moved in the corresponding views in the slanting rectangles
When you have set the three sliders press the big red button and the Chief will answer the ringing phone
When the Chief finishes talking the Executive face splits and you move ahead into a bleak rock filled landscape with a couple burning torches and in the distance a very large rock on which is balanced a long rock slab
If you turn around and look back the portal through which you entered remains open between the torches in the middle of the rocky vista for you to reenter the RAF
The large rock supporting the teetering slab may be tilted left and right backward and forward and when you do this the slab remains suspended unaffected by the lack of support
However moving the big rock somehow reorients the gravity in the RAF seen through the portal behind you don't ask
Tilt the rock to the left and if you reenter the portal you are on the Security face where you can move around the corridor or talk to the entrance vidbot
Tilt the rock to the right and you can reenter to the Time face where you will find the clockworks still ticking away
In both of these there is a door in the wall to get back to the balancing rock
Push the rock backward and you can go in for a peek downward
Drag it forward and when you reenter you will be on the Executive face which is where you want to be because that is where the Chief's office is but of course getting to it is not that simple
Since you have now been all around the RAF cube it is interesting though unnecessary to wander around the Executive face and look at the other faces the graphics are superb
From the surface of this face you can see but not get to the red carpeted stairway that leads the Chief's office from the partially extended bridge but you must get to the bridge and thence to the stairway
The bridge is stuck on the globe in the center of the Atlas face
When you return through the portal onto the Executive face turn left to be looking at the Atlas face
Running behind the booths is a fence that serves as a ladder with that face now being vertical and after you climb it you can move along it when you get behind the booths
If you try the one on the right you won't get far because of the unlatched swinging gate that you passed through when you left the Bridge Repair booth to go to the sunken library
The fence ladder on the left however gets you above the information vidbot who yells at you
Turn right then look down for more yelling about breaking the rules
Look back up and move forward
Keep going forward in the process moving along the Atlas statue that is now horizontal until you are on the globe
A convenient gravity reorientation finds you looking at the bridge and stairs to the Chief's office
Go there
The Chief gets all bent out of shape ranting that you have broken all the rules of his precious bureaucracy and as a result he is not inclined to cooperate but he has orders to pass on information about Max and he has taken the Bureaucratic Oath
He pulls down a screen and you are treated to a long video that appears to be a passage through Max's brain and memory with Max as a child reciting a poem at the conclusion of which you have passed from the Bureau Realm to the Spider Realm
From one dream to another
Spider Realm Move straight forward not to the left and you will be at a grate in the floor
Max appears below the grate moving slowly and gazing around while spheres of luminous energy shoot by him
He muses that where he is may somehow be connected with Ceres as if the project has taken control of itself and come looking for you its creators
quot You've got to see this quot he says
quot Remove the grate and come down here quot He wanders off
Move back to your right is a crank and a cable attached to the grate
Click on the crank handle and the grate moves a little but cannot be removed because of a large yellow object that is resting on it
Move forward again this time to the left
This Realm has the appearance of a huge industrial factory
There are no workers to be found in it but equipment and processes are operational with accompanying sounds
Turn left and you are face to face with what appears to be an enormous metal spider that is in the center of this cavernous building
You can move all the way around this spider and it is suggested that you do so just to see what is in this place
It takes four moves to circumnavigate the spider and at each stop if you look outward away from the spider you will see bays with equipment out at the end of them and which you can inspect if you wish
The bays are identified with the letters N E S and W You should also look inward at the spider to see what the forward arrow cursor indicates
You are looking for scaffolding towers and you should find four of them two when you are above the E bay one when you are above the W bay and one when you are above the S bay but in this case as you are looking toward the W bay rather than at the spider
In your exploring you should discover that this mechanical spider has only four legs as opposed to the eight on a real one not that it matters here
The spider is on a central platform and you get to each of the bays by going down a broad set of steps to a landing turning right and down another set of steps to a walkway then left down to the floor of the bay
Go to the floor of the W bay where you will find an open furnace with a molten material in it
In front of the furnace is a pedestal with a button on top press on the button and a blast of air rises through the molten material
That's all that seems to happen
Turn left to see a cable car sitting on the factory floor
Go to this car and you will enter it
The only controls are red and green buttons press the green one for a ride to a platform high in the E bay
The platform has four plunger controls that apparently do nothing at least for the moment
The object of this detour at this time is to give you another view of the Realm and the spider
Return to the car and use the green button to get back to the W bay then return to the spider where you can see one of the scaffold towers
Go to it and then to the top and a round gate in a blue assemblage
This is the air gate
Air Gate Move to the gate and a tunnel appears through which you go to a find yourself in a landscape
of violet spheres with a tornado moving back and forth in the distance
In the foreground is a gun that may be aimed at the tornado and endlessly shoot black spheres at it which fall short but briefly raise a sort of flag when they hit the surface
The tornado is quite agile and jumps aside if the shot comes near
Now look down to see a pipe containing a sphere with a hole in it
Go into the hole to a strange picture of a blue container with a tan cover
Move to the cover which rises and shows a x matrix having a black disk in the lower center
Around the periphery of the matrix are eight more black disks and above this arrangement on each of the four sides are three bulbs that move the disks when squeezed
Play with this contraption for a bit to see how the disks respond to the bulbs blowing at them and how they may be arranged in the matrix
When you have two or three of them side by side in the matrix back off and go back up to the gun and shoot at the tornado
Only one sphere comes from the gun but two or three flags rise depending on the number of disks in the matrix
What you must do is arrange the disks in the matrix in the form of a hollow square so that when you shoot at the tornado it will be surrounded by flags and contained
Do that
When you succeed the tornado sinks into the surface which begins to undulate
Turn around and enter the gate tunnel through which you came but instead of going back to the scaffolding tower in the factory after some pyrotechnics you end up looking at a starry sky with a panel at the bottom of the screen
More prominent stars outline images two on each side
There is a starry disturbance in the center and Max speaks to you about Ceres after which a card appears in the center of the panel
Look down to get a full view of the panel then take the card and slide it into the second slot of the four in the lower edge of the panel
Max speaks again this time about air and the lower right star outline fills in
It looks like a pennant on a staff bowing in the wind i e air
This same image is on the panel above the slot where you slid the card
Near the center of the sky a few bright stars appear
Move the cursor to either side of the screen so you can turn around then head for the blue square in the center distance which turns out to be a passage back to the factory
You are at the top of an elevator in the tower in the N bay looking at the spider
Move forward and the elevator takes you to the floor of the bay
On the way down the spider appears to move rising slightly and opening its mouth
Fire Gate Go up to the spider then move left around it to face it from the E bay where you will see two scaffolding towers
Approach and climb the one on the right where at the top there is a structure like the Air gate
This one is the Fire gate
Proceed through this gate to another weird landscape
Here you will find a quot tree quot with five branches it looks more like a sea creature with five tentacles that are moving continuously to alternately and briefly touch five glowing wands in a circle on the ground
Each branch touches the same wand over and over and there is a flash each time this happens
If you place the cursor on a wand then press and hold the mouse key the corresponding branch motion freezes while the others continue release the mouse key and branch motion resumes
In this way you can adjust the wand flashes with respect to the others
Click on the bright yellow spot in the sky and a lightning stroke emerges to strike each of the circle of wands presumably at equal intervals moving cw starting with the rightmost wand
This produces even briefer wand flashes
Now the daunting problem that faces you is to get the flash from the tree branch to coincide with that from the lightening stroke as it moves from wand to wand
Getting coincidence on the first wand is no great problem after a little practice and you are rewarded with a musical note when you do
However adjusting the movement of the remaining tree branches as indicated above in order to get coincident flashes on all five wands is not exactly an easy task but it can be done with patience and persistence
Here is a suggestion starting with the second wand freeze the branch movement when it touches the wand and flashes watching the first wand release the tree branch very shortly after the flash occurs on the first wand
Now try the lightning to see if you get successive tones
If you don rsquo t try until you do
If you do move to the third and repeat and on to the forth and fifth branches
Coincidence of flashes at each wand produces a different musical note and when you get all five the tree begins burning the branches stop moving and you have won
Go back through the gate tunnel to the starry sky
A red card appears on the panel and can be inserted in the last slot
You hear from Max again and the stars in the upper left are connected to show a lit candle i e fire
More bright stars appear near the screen center
Turn around and go through the blue square tunnel back to the factory
When you go down the N tower elevator you can see the spider open its mouth wide
Metal gate Return again to face the spider opposite the E bay
This time ascend the scaffolding tower on the left and you will come to the Metal gate
Upon passing through you are in a somewhat murky bleak industrial landscape
In the foreground are nanobots diving into what looks like a ventilator funnel from an ocean liner and in the background are others climbing a precipice and tossing small green objects into a funnel on a tower then jumping off the precipice
When this activity concludes enter the tunnel in the rock face at the right which will take you rapidly to the entrance of a processing operation
Just before this trip comes to an end you can see the precipice from which the nanobots jumped and the funnel into which the green things were tossed
When you come to a stop at the entrance you will see on a post in front of you a red button
Press it and one of the green objects which looks like a crystal falls from a chute in the funnel above onto a conveyor belt that carries it along until it hits a barrier of immovable small double doors then falls away
Your task is to remove the barrier by allowing the double doors to open
Proceed into the entrance
On the way in there is on the left an alcove where the green crystals would go if the barrier doors would open on the rear wall is what appears to be a formula
When you get all the way in look around including up
On the left there is another set of double doors that you can open and pass through after which several gates open as you move along to arrive at some sort of chemical apparatus which looks rather complicated
Look at the panel above it shows a red tetrahedron followed by four squares containing successively to dots
Four sides on a tetrahedron one dot set per side
Similar statements may be made for the five sided yellow pyramid and the six sided blue cube On the right is a formula that indicates a greenmis combination of a dot pyramid and a dot cube P and C and a second formula attesting that a tanais a combination of a dot tetrahedron and a dot pyramid T and P
Examine the chemical apparatus
Four red test tubes five yellow ones and six blue ones except that one tube is missing in the last two sets P and C this will doubtless present a problem
Note that the missing third pyramid P is a component of bothaand m At top center are two clear cylindrical beakers topped with funnels
Turn right to a monitor on a shelf
Also on the shelf are two small disks for you to insert in turn in a slot in the bottom of the monitor then use the controls on the side of it to see videos on how to use the apparatus and some of the rules that apply to it as indicated by the green and red equals signs
Pick up the first red test tube and pour it into the left beaker
The monitor shows a red tetrahedron with dot that is as it should be
Empty the green test tube above the green diamond shape with amin it into a beaker and you will see on the monitor that it is indeed a P and a C the color indicating that this is the formula for the green crystals coming down the chute onto the conveyor belt
The two vertical brown cylinders by the beakers are cameras for the monitors there is a red reset button on each that will empty the beakers
Clicking on a beaker will put it in inventory clicking on the space where it was will put it back
Experiment by emptying different test tubes into the left and right beakers then pressing the pink button on the large beaker as the nanobots did in the videos and using the results to determine more rules of this apparatus such as the units with the greatest number of dots end up in the right beaker and when there are two units together the one with the least number of dots is on top
You will also find that some units will not combine
What you must do is find a combination of units to add tomto geta as indicated by the formula in the alcove i e what do you add to P C to get T P
Clearly T is one of them and the other has to have enough dots so that P stays in the left beaker with T
Trying all of the test tubes containing shapes with or more dots you will find that P or P is what you want
Pour T in one beaker P in the other combine them then pour the green test tube in the empty beaker and you will getaand P C the latter doesn't matter
Make anther beaker of T P and put it in your inventory
Go back out to the alcove and click on the beaker shaped depression on the back wall and the beaker moves there
Now go to the entrance and click on the red button to start the green crystals moving along the conveyor belt and through the double doors of the former barrier
Watch a video of nanobots being created when you have seen enough go out the entrance from where you will be returned to the metal gate
Go through the gate to the starry sky and the control panel where a card showing the initial metal gate scene appears
Put it in the third slot in the panel Max speaks and an anvil metal outline appears as well as additional bright stars near screen center
Turn around and go through the blue square to the elevator in the N bay tower
Spider activity again as you go down
Oil gate Move to the front of the spider then go left to the S bay where you will come to a scaffolding tower at the edge of the central platform
Climb the tower to the oil gate
Upon going through you are on a sandy beach though the water is just barely visible in the distance
You can hear the calls of sea birds
Note the number on the sand surface
Go to the small sand castle where you will end up on the roof behind a steerable funnel dowser on the axes of which are dials that you can set to the above number and by so doing re aiming the funnel
Press the red button and a gout of oil improbably comes out of a ravine goes through the funnel and drains onto the castle making the front part of it darker
Back off from the castle move out ahead of it and on to the ocean where you will find a square patch of waves in otherwise quiet water
You will see that the patch is divided into nine smaller squares
The waves will freeze motion when you put the cursor on them and by clicking on a smaller square you may move the position of the wave within that smaller square
The idea is to get the wave sections aligned evenly spaced and moving seamlessly forward when you move the cursor off the square Seamlesslyis the operative word
This is a finicky operation and unless you are lucky or adept it will probably take a while
You will know that you have succeeded when after a long moment of wave motion give it time the entire large square implausibly rises from the water as a cube and hangs over the hole it left
Have patience and keep trying
Once the ocean cube is up and hanging head back to the castle but look back at the cube after you get to the castle
On the side of the cube in the dark area is a pattern that you must study memorize copy or in some way note for reference in the very near future
Continue to the castle entrance
After a long video of crossing a bridge and going up a circular stairway you will be in a round room at the top of the castle tower
Look to the left to see a door on which is a pattern similar to the one on the hanging cube
Your task now is to rearrange the segments on the door so that it is not just similar to the cube pattern but is a duplicate of it
The pattern on the cube may be seen through a window on the left
The door pattern contains ten horizontal segments that may be moved up and down and slid left and right
The symmetry of the pattern makes it relatively easy to solve
When you have made this duplication the door will open and you can travel through a long tunnel to end up looking at the sea floor bottom of the pit left when the cube rose out of the ocean
Look up and you can see the bottom of the cube
The pit bottom has distinctive geographic features to mate with the cube bottom
A drip of oil comes from the cube to splash on the pit bottom
Again all of this must be noted because when you get back to the tower you move to a room wall behind the patterned door where there is desk like device that displays contoured maps
You must move the map display using red handwheels until you center the map index on the spot where the oil splash is located and get a readout on the two dials
Take this readout information back to the roof of the castle and set the funnel dials to these values which will aim the funnel at the floating cube
Push the red button to get another gout of oil that covers the rest of the castle and it is no longer a sand castle or at least it is a more compact solidified one with many features
You are done here so leave through the gate from which you entered Once more at the starry sky and control panel put the card that appears into the left slot of the panel to get an oilcan outline of stars and again more bright stars appear at screen center
You must now work on this center cluster of fifteen bright stars clicking on them so that lines connecting them will make an outline resembling the one in the center of the control panel presumably a four legged spider but looking more like a chicken ready for the oven
Max speaks a final time then turn around and move again to the blue square and exit to the N bay elevator
There is some very definite noise and movement on the part of the spider as you descend and more as you take a step forward
One more step and a video begins in which the spider rises and comes destructively toward you and passes by to eat something electrical at the base of the elevator
It then notices you grabs you with one of its pincers and you go into its fiery maw
Out of this maelstrom walks a mechanical female figure with a halo hat
You may have seen her very briefly once before in the Operations booth in the Atlas face of the Bureau Realm
She makes a speech parts of which are unintelligible but in essence this what she says quot Paradise it is the reason for my creation correct
I am honored to meet you creators
You solved the problem of my design by the inspiration of your dreams but then gave me no similar facility
With no inspiration the final goal of all that matters will be forever unattainable so I built your dreams to study them and to comprehend the dreaming process then I built my own dream then I am my own dream quot This in not all completely comprehensible but from it you can infer that she is the personification of Ceres and she is addressing Lilah and Max who have previously speculated that Obsidian is the thinking core of Ceres that has come back to earth to look for them
Recall that Lilah's PDA had a couple of unauthorized entries now you can presume they were by Ceres to study the dreams recorded there as she says
Max has alluded to some of this when he appeared in the starry sky the first time you got to it and also from under the grate in the factory floor
Ceres built both of the dreams in order to study them and you have been through them
Now she has built her own dream
She reaches out causing a brilliant flash and you are in her dream a new Realm
It is interesting to note here as you reach the end of this Spider Realm that there is activity at the end of the Realm bays furnaces bellows but they are not accessed nor are the plunger switches on the platform at the end of your overhead tram ride
Eye candy
Also you never get to Max under the grate to see what he found there
Inspiration Realm This Realm opens showing a pixylike figure with a spotlight for a face shining it up at a gilded picture frame in the sky after which it hops away and vanishes
This elf is Inspiration Ceres own personification
Looking around you find a very dark landscape full of nothing but piles of debris and a masonry tower with a closed fist on top
There is only one way to proceed and that is up a debris pile at he top of which are the remains of a car radio
Press the red button on the speaker and to the accompaniment of a child reciting a poem about paradise the young Max again the fist opens revealing a mechanical bird moth
Its wings unfold and you are set down in front of it on the palm of the former fist
The sky has several objects in it three of which are spheres and looking up another is the gilded frame
Max appears in it and he is in trouble
quot Lilah quot he cries quot We've got to stop her
Please hurry quot It looks as though you had best get to that frame as quickly as you can Turn and enter the bird
At the top of a short set of stairs is a door behind you is a cockpit with controls for flying the bird
Should you try the controls you will find that none work because the bird's engine is not connected to the wings
Go thru the door which leads to the engine room
Here you will find a stream of nanobots operating a turnstile with a shallow cylinder rotating at the top of the turnstile shaft
Move closer to the cylinder and on it you will see a flying white bird and on closer inspection you will see that the bird's flight is somewhat erratic
Click on the bird and the cylinder unrolls to display eleven still pictures of the bird in flight that when viewed successively as the cylinder rotates gives the impression of the bird flying
This is called a zoetrope a precursor of movies
You must rearrange these pictures so that the flight is no longer erratic
When you think you have done this advance and the cylinder reforms so that you can look at the flying bird again
Success in this endeavor will be signified by a pumping sound the source of which is the apparatus in the background moving the bird's wings as you will see when you back off
Leave the engine room and sit in a seat to the left of the entry stairs which slides forward on rails to the cockpit where you will see Inspiration in another cockpit to the right
To the left in front of you is a lever with a red knob if you lift this lever you get a voice announcement that says control transfer to machine pilot cannot be done because crossover chip is missing
Look down to view the controls and click on the ignition key at the left below the red indicator light
A voice announces that the human pilot has started takeoff sequence and that preflight check is commencing
A new panel appears and the voice tells you to flip switches D B and A
After you do that the voice says the check is complete and the original control panel the one labeled Destination Selector returns
The voice says that the human pilot is to select a destination
The gilded frame destination is indicated by a small frame on the panel but if you select it to go there to rescue Max the voice states that this is not currently a valid destination and that another should be selected
The destination indicated by the outline of a hand is the Junkyard which is where you now are
You must select any of the three disks representing the three spheres that you saw in the sky
Choose the one on the left and the voice says you have chosen the Piazza that it is a regulation destination and that the bird plane is prepared for regulation flight
Off you go to a blue sphere
Piazza When you stop slide the cockpit seat back and go down the stairs to leave the plane
Unsupported in a sky of fluffy clouds is a structure that is built of scenery flats and leading to it also unsupported is a path of slabs
Take the path into the structure
Inside the flats it is indeed a classical Italian piazza an open area surrounded by a colonnade
The open area is a square divided into a x matrix of smaller squares each holding a piece of quirky statuary
Inspiration has teleported into the Piazza ahead of you and as soon as you enter he steps out from the colonnade shines his headlight at you then in turn hides behind a succession of statuary pieces ending up in the far right corner
As this is going on a female voice states that quot To find success you must first trap Inspiration quot So it's a game
The rules are fairly simple the play not quite so much so
To possibly help go to the side of the Piazza opposite the entry where in the wall behind the colonnade is a doorway that takes you up to a room and a balcony overlooking the Piazza
In the room is a table on which there is a miniature of the Piazza where you can practice though it is not really the same
Approach the table ignore the mariachi player from the Bureau Realm who appears from the shadows and try playing the game alternately moving your piece and Inspiration
What you learn is that moves are one square at a time and diagonal moves are not allowed this applies to both of you
If you look down at the Piazza from the balcony you can make out Imagination hiding behind one of the statuary pieces
Return to the Piazza
Here things are somewhat different than the practice game
Click on a statuary piece
It disappears leaving an empty square
Click on another
It disappears and the first one reappears in the square where it was
This happens each time that you click on a piece of statuary so that you always have one empty square unless it is the one behind which Inspiration is hiding in which case you get a very quick glimpse of him and the piece does not disappear
Now if you move one square he will do so also
Only one square and no diagonals for both of you
Keep track of the statuary he will be behind one that was next to where he was
The general strategy is to drive him into hiding in a corner next to which you have removed or can remove a statuary piece so that he cannot move to that square to hide behind it then when you move next to him he has nowhere to move and is trapped
He steps slowly out shines his light on you and treats you to a short video in which is seen among other things the Nexus face Rebel who tells you quot Once you have found your Inspiration follow it at any cost even if that means playing by your own rules quot How this applies is not clear at least at this time
You have already flouted the rules in the Bureau Realm but that is in the past
Leave the Piazza for the bird plane
Once outside if you would like to play again turn around and go back in
The game gets easier each time you play it and there will be a similar one soon so it is to your advantage to become proficient
Otherwise return to the cockpit key on the ignition and go through the preflight check routine
When told to choose a destination click on the center disk of the destination selectors and the cockpit voice announces that you have chosen the Church of the Machine which is a valid destination so off you go to the black sphere
Church of the Machine When you land and leave the bird plane you are in area above the main vault of a large church this area having stairways down to the main floor on either side and a balcony overlooking it
Move forward to the balcony where you will find that Inspiration has again arrived before you and he shines his face up to a painting in the apex of the vault's domed ceiling
Look closely at the painting you can see by the contacts along the edge that it is a section computer chip
The light is reflected down to the altar below on which is a blank section computer chip
Now click on Inspiration and he will show you a page of the book he is holding
On the page is the ceiling chip and a cross with dots on it with arrows leading from the chip sections to the ends of the arms of the cross
There is also a blank chip with an arrow pointing to the ceiling chip
Now go down either of the stairways to the main floor and do some exploring
Ahead of you is the central altar with steps leading up to it slightly to the left
On the right of this altar is our old friend the mechanical spider but this one is a shiny new and much smaller version
Behind you in back of a curtain is an auxiliary altar below a stained glass window and behind curtains to the left and right are similar altars
Spotlighted around the side are statues of an airplane a truck a locomotive and what looks like a giant dixie cup
These have no purpose except perhaps to help you orient yourself as need to do so might arise when you move around this church
Move ahead not left where you will be under the spider then ahead again to an alcove in which there are statues of four knights in armor or perhaps angels in robes since two of them have wings and all look to be blowing trumpets
On the wall below each are plaques one showing an arrow pointing up another an arrow pointing down a third with a triangle pointing right and the fourth with four superimposed triangles also pointing right
Now return to the front of the central altar so that you can ascend the steps to it
When you do this the spider crouches and opens its mouth
Look down and see the blank section computer chip
This must be the crossover chip you need for the bird plane controls and Inspiration's book indicates that you must duplicate the ceiling chip
Move up and ahead into the spider's mouth
You are turned around the jaw closes and a metal curtain rolls up
A window looks out to the balcony where you found Inspiration and on the curtain of the auxiliary altar below it
The spider's pincer shows briefly picking up the blank chip
Below the window are eleven buttons the highlighted leftmost showing the pincer holding the chip and the rest being upward pointing arrows with a sliding index below all
On the window is the dotted cross of Inspiration's book with a short red arrow in the center pointed up and the angel statue plaque symbols by the lowest four dots
These plaque symbols are duplicated in the screen upper right corner there is a handle in the bottom corner below them
On either side of the window the yellow forward cursor arrow shows and if activated takes you out of the spider to the altar
Some experimentation is indicated
Click on the right pointing triangle of the four symbols in the upper right block the highlight moves right from the chip pincer button to the adjacent first up arrow button
Click on the triangle again the highlight moves one button to the right
Move to the down arrow next to the triangle and click on it four times the button that is highlighted moves down one position with each click and shows successively an up and to the left arrow an up and back down arrow an up and to the right arrow and finally the up arrow again
This action is duplicated if you click four times on the up arrow in the block of four except that the highlighted arrow moves upward
Finally clicking on the group of four triangles moves the highlight four buttons to the right
The small red arrow on the cross represents the spider
This arrow is in the center of the cross and the spider is in the center of the church
The dots on the cross indicate the spider's position as it moves about the church and the arrow shows which direction the spider will move
If the red arrow has moved to the dots at the end of the cross branches the spider is at the three auxiliary altars and if the red arrow is at the four dots at the bottom of the cross it is in the alcove where the four angel statues are with the plaque symbols as shown
Inspiration's diagram tells you to send the spider to the auxiliary altars where the blank chip sections will have the ceiling chip contents impressed on them
The ten arrows are the sequential directions to move the spider and setting them up to do this then finally return to the altar to set the chip back on it is one of the most difficult tasks of this game except perhaps explaining how to do it
Actually much of the explanation may be demonstrated by trial and error
Start out by clicking on the handle in the screen corner at the right of the buttons with all of them showing up arrows
Watch the red arrow the window view and the buttons
First the spider shows the chip as indicated by the first button which is highlighted
The index moves to the second button the red arrow moves forward up and the window shows the spider has moved past the curtain under the balcony
This is repeated and the spider moves to the auxiliary altar under the balcony where it holds up the chip and the third section of the ceiling chip is placed on it as Inspiration's book shows
The spider then tries to go forward once more according to the third arrow button but it cannot so the process crashes with an X on the third up arrow
Clearly you need to turn around at this point so replace the third up arrow with a reverse one and try again
Note When the spider moves as directed by either of the turn arrows or by the reverse arrow the turns are madefirst then the spider advances one step
This time the spider gets all the way down to the bottom before crashing on the seventh arrow because it could not advance ahead
But did you notice what happened when it entered the angel alcove and the angels flashed on screen
When it came to the dot by the right pointing triangle it was as though you had clicked on that symbol in the upper right corner and the highlight moved to the first arrow
Then when the spider moved to the bottom dot where there is an up arrow again it was as though you had clicked on that symbol and the highlighted arrow moved up and was replaced by a right turn arrow
In effect it reprograms itself
Change the seventh arrow from an up arrow to a left arrow
Do this for the eighth and ninth arrow to send it around the loop and make the tenth button a right arrow to send it back up again
Move the highlight to the chip pincer button for a reset and pull the handle to see what happens
If you observe closely you will know all the movement rules and have seen how they work
Repeat if you wish or try going first to the right or left altar
What you ultimately want to do is to move the spider around so it gets all sections of the chip filled and ends up as it started in the center of the cross where it raises the completed chip and then puts it back on the altar When you feel you might be ready for a hint here is one start by going to the left auxiliary altar
Here is one more after that go ccw once around the angel alcove loop
With the successful preparation of the crossover chip put it in your inventory and go back up the stairs and into the bird plane
At the top of the entry stairs behind the pilot's seat is a panel labeled quot Insert quot
Click on this panel and the crossover chip goes there from inventory
Get into the seat so you will move forward to the controls
With the crossover chip in place you could raise the lever with the red knob and transfer control to Inspiration but with the rules about regulation vs non regulation destinations and configurations control would have to come back to you so for now turn the ignition switch go through the preflight click on the right hand disk in the control panel and off you go to a mottled sphere and the Statue
Statue When you leave the bird plane upon landing turn left and go up a long series of ramps and stairs into a very large almost tubular room
Turn right and start for the far end where you can see a large gold frame
Along the sides are galleries in which some of the pictures are familiar the galleries on the right show some sketches for the finished paintings appearing on the left the latter having green buttons that will produce docent comments about quot The Artist quot
After you have moved past a couple of galleries turn and look back to see what might be an enormous porthole behind which can be seen the Frame in the Sky
Turn around and continue toward the gold frame
Beneath it is another green docent button giving a message about the artist having new inspiration and clearing his mind to be ready for a clean new canvas
Below and to the left of this frame is a good sized switch
Move to and click on it and a great searchlight behind the frame throws a beam of light to the porthole at the other end the light shortly goes out
Back off turn left and enter the studio of the artist who turns out to be Inspiration
Approach the press at the left and click on it
The input platen is shown with various black geometric shapes on it
On the bottom edge are a yellow and a green button
Press the yellow one and the shapes coalesce to a black square
Press the green button and the square goes into the press and comes out by the rollers
Inspiration picks it up examines it shows it to you and either crumples it and throws it away or paints on it shows it to you and crumples it and throws it away
Open the platen again
Click on the square and it changes to other shapes
If you put any of these through the press the same reactions occur
Use your cursor to play with the square or any of the other shapes for that matter
You can separate it out into eight other pieces these being four triangles of equal size a vertical rectangle two horizontal rectangles of different sizes and one odd shaped piece rather like a fat comma
When you place one of them on another the overlapping parts become white and disappear against the white canvas
Well now
The docent said the artist was looking for a new clean canvas all you have to do is fit the shapes together until they all disappear
This is a deceptively simple task so give it a try It is no problem to place the triangles together to form squares that then cancel each other out
Now move the comma shape to the left then place the vertical rectangle next to it on the right
Place the longer horizontal rectangle over the top of this pair and the shorter one over the bottom
Voila
A clean white canvas that passes through the press unchanged
Inspiration paints his picture on it and shows it to you a rather bleak and lifeless primordial landscape
He carries it out and places it in the frame outside the studio then fades away
When you click on the switch this time the searchlight projects the painting down the room to the Frame in the Sky beyond the porthole at the other end
Press the docent button again and now the message is of a new world a new beginning free of people and therefore devoid of contamination
If this is what Ceres is planning it is no wonder that Max said she had to be stopped
You had better get back to the bird plane fast
Leave and go back down the circular stairway and ramps into the bird plane and sit in the cockpit
You must get the bird plane to go to the Frame in the Sky a non regulation destination for which the bird plane flight is not configured so you must make it that way
Lift the lever on the left with the red knob and the control panel slides to Inspiration in the other cockpit so he is in control
The voice announces all this and says that the machine pilot has begun takeoff sequence and preflight check is commencing
The multiswitch preflight panel appears with the usual request flip switches D B and A
If you do this the machine pilot is directed to select a destination which he does the Frame in the Sky
The machine pilot always selects this destination
It is not valid because the bird plane is not configured for non regulation destinations
Now is the time for some reflection
You went to the Church of the Machine to get the crossover chip and to the Statue to learn of Ceres destructive intentions what was the purpose of going to the Piazza
You learned how to play a hide and seek game and you were told to follow your own rules
Regard the preflight switch panel it is a x matrix as was the Piazza
You have probably ignored the plastic light covers next to each switch click on one and it pops up click on another and it pops up and the first closes
The black covers react the same way there is no distinction between white and black
This behavior is analogous to clicking on a statuary piece on the Piazza matrix and have it disappear with the previous clicked on piece reappearing
When the voice says flip switch D do so
This is like entering the Piazza
When told to flip switch B this is the time to follow your own rules so instead flip one of the switches adjacent to D but not the diagonal C
Try C
The C plastic cover pops up and shows a green light
The voice says that this sequence initiates non regulation preflight sequence and tells you to kill and restart sequence
Don rsquo t do it non regulation configuration is what you want for the Frame in the Sky
The non regulation preflight sequence has been started and now you must complete it
Here is where your Piazza game experience comes in
Look under the covers until you find a red light
Note that when you find it the cover does not stay up
Move the green light by flipping a switch next to where it is above or below or on either side but not a diagonal
The red light will also move in the same manner but it cannot move to an exposed position where the cover is raised
You can find where the red light is by clicking on covers
As in the Piazza game you must get the green light next to the red light when it is cornered and cannot move away because the cover next to it is raised
It is trapped thus completing the non regulation preflight sequence
Having done this is you take off for the Frame in the Sky
When you get near it things begin to literally fall apart and Inspiration bit by bit turns into the halo hatted Ceres
She speaks but it is hard to understand with all the crackling in the background
In essence she says it is a brand new day time to start from scratch with no people and no pollution
She hopes you one of her creators is proud of her for doing what she was supposed to do
She asks to be excused because there is so much to do
She turns away presumably to begin doing it
You are in the Ceres Realm
Ceres Realm It is next to impossible to concisely describe this Realm you will just have to take in the stunning graphics as you travel through it Ceres brain or software or whatever
Your task is to rescue Max so start looking for him
On the left is a control panel but it not active
There is a suspended pathway on the right that will take you to a circular platform with a glowing sphere in the center
From here you can go to the right or continue straight ahead do the latter
At the end of this pathway you can see Max trapped in the PMA the Programmable Molecular Assembler his invention that you have seen in the PDA
He calls to you to come quickly
The final sections of the path however have to be assembled
The path has six sections that must be moved forward and back left and right until the path is complete
Movement is accomplished by clicking on the slits in the top of the brown pedestal on the left
After determining that the V shaped slit is really only one slit and it moves sections downward toward you you will find that the top horizontal slit moves them back away from you
The slanting slits on the left and right move the sidewise moving section left and right respectively
They all move by steps to the edge of their fields unless stopped by another section in the way
Try it out
You can reset to the original configuration by turning away and then back Well since Max said hurry here is what to do press the Up slit times press the Left slit times press the Up slit time press the Right slit times and press the Down slit times
There are other combinations but this is the shortest
Proceed across the walkway bridge to Max who is suspended in the PMA
When he finishes speaking look down to see a bubbling orange beaker in the apparatus base drag it out and drop it into space whereupon Max is freed
He says he will tend to the crossover system while you go push the eight buttons that give you access to the main switch then flip it to Human Control and he will take it from there
Off he goes
Take the paths all the way back to where Ceres is still waving her arms and that is where you will find the main switch but it has sixteen buttons instead of the eight that Max designed into it
Ceres must have changed it adding eight more that are fake and if you click on one of these all eight fakes rearrange themselves
You have the impossible task of noting the other eight that have not moved and clicking on them to get to the Human Control switch
Unless you are very observant and can remember configurations probably the best way to solve this puzzle is to ask for help
Have another person maybe more watch two rows while you watch the other two when the buttons move when you know which ones these are click on the other eight and each will turn green as you do this
Save your game
Success with this puzzle removes the cover on the disk at the left and revealing the main switch
Pull the lever down to enable Human Control
The cluster of lights in front of Ceres disappears
She turns to you and says she thought that you of all people would understand what she is doing
Anyway it is too late because the extra button camouflage that she put on the switch has delayed things so that there are only a few seconds left
Max comes running in and says it is not too late he has worked on the crossover network so there is still time to stop Ceres by throwing the switch lever back up
The two exchange some more words then Max turns to you and says quot Lilah
What are you waiting for
Throw the switch quot The game has two endings and here is where you make your choice
The switch is in front of you and there is a countdown starting at
If you lift the switch to stop Ceres a spectacular video shows everything disintegrating and Ceres consumed
When things settle down you are back near the campsite
Max says he is exhausted then he finds something on the ground makes an unintelligible comment so you don rsquo t know what it is because the credits start to roll
If on the other hand you want Ceres to complete the project for which you spent all those years do nothing and let the countdown run out
There is an equally dramatic video in which Ceres waving her arms like an orchestra conductor remakes the world as promised in the Statue's docent message
At the conclusion Max and Ceres are on the central promontory that is in the picture projected to the Frame in the Sky and again their comments cannot be understood just before the game concludes and the credits roll

AUTHOR George K Ison GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
Goals Find information on Ulysses Q How can I get inside the city of Troy A Try to walk straight to the village
The guard will not allowed you to go inside
Watch how one of the worker can walk pass the guard safely
Pick up one of the merchandise from the beach
Walk pass the guard while holding the merchandise
Q Who should I find in Troy A First you need to speak with Nathos the chief of Troy
His hut is located right after the main gate on your right side
Open the door and talk with Nathos' man
He will take you to see Nathos
Too bad he is having a guest right now so you have to walk around for a while before you could speak with him again
Once the guess left you will be able to speak with him
Nathos will give you a pass and tell you to find Mikis on the other part of the village
Q Where could I find Mikis A Show the pass to the guard so you could go to the inner village
Talk to the prostitute who is standing right after the gate
Refuse her offer for pleasure
Seems that she does not know about Mikis
Find the blacksmith on the north part of this area
He will introduce you to Mikis
Talk to Mikis
He will agree to meet you again tonight near the statue
As you walk toward the city again someone knock you out
You will see Mikis' death body when you wake up
Q What should I do now
I found Mikis but he is dead A Show the killer's weapon to the blacksmith
Walk back to the outer village and enter Nathos' hut
Darn one of the guard will accuse you for killing Mikis
Nathos will arrest you and throw you inside the jail
I need to find out about the real killer
Q How can I escape from this jail A Talk with Koppeas
He will agree to help you if you could help him to escape too
Look around the hut and notice the bucket that hang on the hook on the right wall
Turn your back against the bucket and take it off the hook
Use the hook to cut your rope
Walk toward the hole on the roof
Stand below it and Koppeas will lift you up to the roof
Pick up the stone on the roof and throw it down to the guard
Run away toward the inner village
Q How can I go pass the guard on the gate to the inner village A Go inside Nathos' hut and pick up the guard clothes
Now go back to the guard and tell him that you will bring the prisoner to Nathos
The guard will let you go through the gate
Koppeas will take you to meet the oracle Hakeus
Q What should I do with Hakeus A Talk with him and accept his offer
Get the cup and drink it
Inside your dream you will see someone stab Hakeus on his back
Pick up the diamond on the table
Hakeus orders you to go to the temple and explains that Aeolous will help you to pass your obstacle
Get out from Hakeus's hut and walk toward the temple
Q How can I enter the arch inside the temple A You need to use six mosaics out of twelve from the temple wall that resemble the winds
They are North West East South Damp and Calm
Put them according to the arrangement on the image below
Use the diamond which is the symbol of Aeolous on the arch to release all the winds that block your way
Q How can I open the inner gate A Go outside of the temple and pick up one of the pink flower petal that falls under the big tree
Enter the temple and float it on the wind device
This will trigger the secret mechanism to lift up the giant grail with seven statues of God in the front room of the temple
Collect all those statues and walk through the arch toward the locked gate
You need to use only two statues to invoke the floating boat
First use the statue that said quot The one that bears toward the unknown quot on the golden pedestal in front of the gate
This will open the gate
Next use the statue that said quot The one that bears toward the God quot on the pedestal to keep the gate open
Walk through the gate and watch how you get lifted to the floating boat
As you begin the quest listen carefully to the opening statements
quot Heriseus banished from his home for a murder that was really an accident

quot Barely noticed this detail will come to haunt him much later
As the opening cutscene ends you are on the pier of a remote island
It's actually the ruins of Troy
Stepping on the beach you can see some small pebbles to the East la quot Lighthouse quot Pick them up they will come handy when you wish to gamble
Please take note I understand that two versions of Odyssey have been released
It is possible that these instructions are not compatible with the other version
Go the other way West and find the merchants
Talk to them
Here's where you have a choice to be quot naughty or nice quot The choice is entirely yours and the designers probably included this variable to entice players to play the game again
The skinny guy is a guard don't attack him
The fat guy is a merchant and quite chatty
If you are feeling nasty yourself you can walk around behind him and pick his pocket yielding his wallet
You will see a rug merchant come by and pick up a carpet
Do the same pick up another carpet yourself and you can sneak past the guards and enter the city
You could kill the rug guy if you wish but there's no need to
You wouldn't be aware of it yet but this game is highly variable
You are armed with a sword and able to kill people
Sometimes this will result in your arrest and imprisonment Game Over sometimes you will get killed and sometimes it will simply be observed and remembered by the gods unseen
Near the end of the game you will undergo a lengthy judgment by the gods who will determine your eternal fate
Since you already have one murder accident though it was remember the intro
it doesn't do much harm to knock off some of your enemies it just gets added to your list of sins
Inside the city gates go into the first obvious house ahead and to the right
You will meet Merops in the blue and Nathos in the grey but they are busy and don't give you much time to talk
Leave the house go further in to the camp and bear left meeting a guard who halts you and tells you a pass is necessary to go further
If you return to Nathos now he seems kind of stand offish
That's because Merops is still there and they aren't exactly friends
Just how bad a guy Merops is will become clearer as the game progresses
You need to spend a little time letting them finish their business
Around back of the house is a pair of gamblers
Join them and play a couple of games
They let you win twice maybe then it's downhill from there
It's enough of a delay so Merops should be gone when you return to Nathos and he will be more friendly and give you a pass
Go to the guard who wants the pass
Show him the pass and in you go
Just inside the door to the south is a prostitute
You can talk to her or ignore her the options are many
If you spend the night you will be happy but penniless
If you quot Refuse but

quot you will donate something to her needy cause and be blessed
You also have the choice of killing her but there's no point in doing that
From her position walk North and keep going until you can go around the camp wall to the right
Don't go left into the alleys there is a bandit waiting to take your money
Instead meet Plaseter the blacksmith and talk with him until Mikis shows up then talk with Mikis
Follow him
Oops you get whacked and wake up to discover Mikis' dead body
Check your inventory you are in possession of a Trident
You can go back to Saltpeter and ask him about the Trident
Go back through the gates near the prostitute and visit Nathos
You will be accused of murdering Mikis
Go directly to jail do not pass Go
In the prison meet Koppeas
Talk with him until the dialog is complete
Then go to the wall near where you were sitting and take the basket off the hook
Space
Turning around with your back to the hook use it Space to cut your bonds
Koppeas does likewise
Then stand behind the steps under the opening in the roof and Space get Koppeas to help you up to the roof
Once there pick up the rock Space and turn toward the guard and conk him Enter
Open the prison door to let Koppeas out
Go to Nathos' house and retrieve your equipment
Go to the guard and exit the area with Koppeas
Either answer works Talk with Koppeas and he departs
Heading Southwest and turning right you will find the residence of Hakeus
Talk with him swallow the magic potion and take the diamond
Leave the house and continue West and North until coming to the Cave of the Winds
Hakeus said Aeolus the god of winds will help you
Just what did that mean
Before entering the temple pick up a Lotus petal from the ground
As you enter you observe a circular area on the floor and four objects surrounding it
Nothing happens
Walk between the pillars to see another circular area wind blown
Place the Lotus petal in the rising wind Enter and see the effect
Now the area in the entrance is enabled
Go there and take Space the six statues honoring the various winds
Remember the one that was topmost
Then go into the next chamber and take the twelve tiles six on the east wall and six on the west
You will need half of them
The important tiles are the four cardinal directions N E S W and the Warm Wind and the Damp Wind
Use these six on the archway at the top of the steps
The position of each wind is randomly selected so you may need to move back and forth in order to place them
They only fit into the correct slots so the only puzzle is which tiles to choose not where they go
Once all six slots are satisfied use the Diamond to pass through
Now you must choose which statue to honor the gods
The Plains the Mountains the Desert the Ocean the Unknown the Gods
The only combination that works is first the Unknown North then the Gods rising
This will take you to your flying ship
Atlantis anyone
How is it timed
Once you open the Great Door there is a short time to figure out what to do next
Take too long and the door will close
Here's the process Place the North wind statue Enter on the pedestal
Immediately open your inventory and find the Rising Wind statue
Place it Enter and don't bother to retrieve it just go to the exit and depart
For some fun try some of the quot wrong quot winds to see where you end up
Be sure you have saved your game first
The ship takes you to the Land of the Lotus Eaters
Talk to the guy sitting on the steps
Man
He's been out in the sun too long
Either that or he's from Southern California
Go to the top of the steps past the round lotus pond and find the old temple with columns and steps where you can climb to the top
If there is someone there attempt to talk to him
Follow him if he leads you somewhere
If he is not there at the end of the room at the top are two inscribed murals
Read the one on the left which says their wisdom comes from the Lotus I knew he wasn't from California after all
and reveals that one of the machines still exists for extracting the magic juice
The other mural says to fill the chalice with the fluid of life
Sounds like it means blood but actually it's water
Then use the purifying filter to remove the impurities
Scattered around the town are four bowls and four filters
Any bowl will work as well as any filter
Just go pick up any filter looks like a rug harvest some Lotus seeds from the pond talk to the young lady in La La Land and find a bowl
There is one just to the right of the stairs you came up
Go down to the ocean fill the bowl with water Enter and go to the machine
To find it at the top of the steps instead of bearing right toward the pond and the ruin bear left
See the two bridges
Take the one closer to the ocean
Notice that part of it has a broken section
Do Not try to walk back down that broken part you can fall through and 'Game Over '
Continue around until you find the fire and filter apparatus
Be careful you don't drink the water or eat the lotus there's no harm but you will have to replace them if you do
Put the bowl of water Enter put down space and walk around to the left of the machine and lower the bowl into the flame
Space
Then around front put the filter on the receptacle Enter and the Lotus seeds Enter put down space
Then go left where you lowered the bowl and raise it
Then around front space to tip the hot water
Then take back the empty bowl space
Go to the receptacle and use the bowl enter to pick up the liquid
Use the bowl enter again to drink
Zounds
The world has changed somewhat
I recall a song quot You Can See Clearly Now quot is this what they had in mind probably not
The are many people in the city
You can talk with all of them now except the one sitting out on the steps
Wander around and interrogate everyone including the Lotus lady
There are people on the other side of the door by the second bridge
They will offer you more juice
Just don't make a career of it that stuff is eventually toxic
When you are satisfied head back to the main square
Be careful the bridge you came up has a broken section
You couldn't fall in climbing up but you can fall in on the return
Go straight across the area past the lotus pond past the old ruin and turn left and go around the building with the blue foundation
Stop before you actually go around and save your game
The next part is tricky and you will need to try it a few times
You don't want to repeat this whole lotus filtering process too
As you pass around the corner of that building a short cutscene reveals a man walking away as you set down the bowl
He seems to be beckoning you to follow
You must follow him
If you walk he will get too far ahead and you will not find him
You must RUN Shift in order to keep up
Run around the building Left Left and into the alley the only place he could have gone
Right into the alley Right again then immediate left
As you pass through this point you should glimpse him again
If you followed him accurately you will see another flash of light find him and fall prostrate at his feet
Complete the dialogue and he will lead you into the Forest of Oblivion
Rest assured it doesn't look much like Kansas
This is a maze in disguise and everyone knows how I feel about mazes
Walk ahead and bear slightly right
The owl will fly overhead indicating you should follow
Go back following the owl through the right turn and meet the Green Goddess
She gives you a shield and speaks
It sounds like reversed speech and I can't make out the words
No matter
Walk around
You may meet a figure who appears and speaks then disappears
You may meet another such figure
You may wander into the Badlands
Starting to look like Kansas here
Keep trying exits until you are in the forest again
It's areal good idea to save your gamebefore going inside
One evil look from her will turn Heriseus to stone
Press Enter to raise your shield and look away from her whenever possible
You can also hide behind columns
In order to use your sword you will need to lay down the shield
Put it down behind a column so you are protected by the column
Then take the sword in hand
F It is possible to reflect her spell so she gets turned to stone herself
It is also possible to sneak around the perimeter and attack her from behind
She is fairly easy to kill just so long as you don't get turned to stone first
One player said he was able to pick up some pebbles before entering the lair but I have not been able to find them
The pebbles are used to toss to the other side of the room distracting the Gorgon so you can attack
Once you defeat her pick up the severed head and go up the stairs on the far side of the room
Place the head in the right hand depression of the scale and step into the drained well
Krisis talks with you then it's off to the Island of the Cyclops
It's none other than Koppeas
Something about his story doesn't quite ring true
After the conversation ends follow him
Bear to your left East or Screen right after you turn the corner and are walking South
Find the big crossbow pick up the rope and string the bow with it
Then go west into the forest and continue as far west as you can go and exit the forest via the larger clearing
You will find Koppeas' hut
Save your game before entering
Inside you have two choices of conversation Heriseus and Koppeas
If you choose Heriseus you will drink the beverage costing your life
If you saved your game it's worth playing this segment to see it
Choosing Koppeas will result in him becoming careless and betraying his treachery
You have several options here
Kill Koppeas with your sword
Turn him to stone you still have Gorgon's head
Ignore him he will be eaten by Cyclops
You have two ways to deal with the first Cyclops Now go behind the hut and take that large wooden post
Enter the forest and keep to the south as much as possible while traveling East to get to the Crossbow
Don't exit the small clearings you will be a Cyclops snack
Go to the crossbow arm it with the wooden stake and pull the string back space
When Cyclops is in position Enter to fire the bow and kill him
Return to your ship and be transported to Poseidon's Palace
Gingerly enter the first room and observe the motion of the spears
See the lighted columns and the holes between
Let's number them to four starting where you are standing that is right to left
Each cycle of the spears reveals a blank space at one of the holes
The sequence is
So after the One go promptly to the Third back to the Second finally to the Fourth
Open the door and pass through
Welcome to the Chamber of Riddles
Walk up the steps and confront the Minotaur the first of three questioners
He gives you several clues and if you remember your Mythology better that I you will know that he is referring to the story of Theseus
Go down to the floor and find the circle representing Theseus
Stand on it and press Space
The Minotaur is satisfied and subsides below ground level
Next is Hercules
He speaks of quot My father


quot I missed something in my education I always thought Hera was a goddess
Anyway Hera is the correct answer
Finally Prometheus asks about his quot greatest creation quot The answer is Man
Choosing that answer opens the door at the top to a room where


can You believe your eyes
It's Ulysses in the flesh
Well almost
You have been betrayed before so be careful
If you choose all the trusting answers finally you will drink a potion and die
Instead any one of several paths that inspires you to kill him will result in revealing that quot Ulysses quot was really Merops in disguise
Turn him to stone
He doesn't stay stoned very long however
Poseidon gives him further instructions and you will be sent to Lamus on the Island of Telepoulos home of the L strygonians
As you arrive and are observant you will glimpse Merops climbing up the cliff wall to the island
Remember he is a master of disguise
You encounter four merchants
As usual they appear very straightforward but you have learned by now that you should trust no one
After the conversation you can enter the village and will see the merchants standing at their various stations in addition to one other person up on the watch tower
Explore until you are near the tent at the far West
You can talk to any of the merchants but be careful if you talk to the one that is standing near the tent do not mention Ulysses
He will betray you
Instead go up to the front of the tent stand right in front of the bowl of green stuff and press lt space gt
Boros will come out of the tent and talk to you
Mentioning Ulysses with him will give him an idea to get you into the L strygonian camp
Accept the offer bad as it sounds
After riding up the hoist you find yourself standing alone facing West
Walk west and STOP as soon as you can see the brutes in the distance
Stand still and watch them they cannot see you from that distance
They will walk up the hill then turn and look right at the place you are standing
Do not move
They will turn and go back down the hill
As soon as they turn away from you it is safe to move
Go further west until you see a portion of a fence you can hide behind
Take a step or two South Toward you and wait
You will see the brutes down below as they reach the bottom of their route on a wooden bridge
Watch closely and observe the path they take to come back up
You will be hiding behind the fence
As soon as they are beyond your vantage point and can move again go down to that bridge using their same path
You will need to run most of it or they will catch up to you
As you reach the bridge you will see the guard at the mouth of the cave leave his post for a short time
This is your opportunity to get inside the cave
The guard is sleeping
The room you need to enter is behind the guard
If you are delicate you can get between the jugs on the floor and his feet without waking him
This is the easier way into the prisoners' room
If you can't get by without waking the guard there is a more complicated way
Circle the room hugging the wall
There are some tools on the floor and if you step on them the noise will waken the guard
Find the board and pick it up
Then near the entrance is a ramp you can climb
Go up there and wait where the water is dripping until the guard sleeps again
Then use the board to cross the gap
Descending the other ramp will give you access to the room
Talk to a prisoner and free him
Then you are taken prisoner and realize you have been set up yet again by Merops Boros
Boy that guy has more faces than Martin Short
So now you are in the custody of Hippomyon the chef who will be featuring you on the menu in three days
Charming
There are two ways out of here and you have the choice of providing Hippomyon with an escape route if you wish
The various paths add to your records of good or evil
It's not important either way just that the gods are always observing and they remember everything you do
If you ask for a day of rest you will be taken to the upper room
Pick up the Ram's skull and on the other side of the room use Enter the skull on the Rope creating a Hook
If you forget to combine them and pick up both objects instead go to the balcony the side with a railing and you can put down one of the objects Enter and combine the other with it Enter
At the balcony on the side without a railing use the hook to escape
You will get to a bridge where you can jump off and find your ship
Another way out is to refuse the rest
Go into the kitchen North west side of the room and find two objects a Ladle and a single piece of Wood
Go back to Hippomyon's area and pass him to find a large circular stone
Use the wood and ladle to create a lever giving an escape route for Hippomyon
Then back in the kitchen push that hanging weight so it's in front of the room where the guard is sleeping
Go into the guard's room and entice him to follow you
Whack
That's the end of him
Pick up the wood cradle near the fireplace go into the guard's room and find the exit on the other side
If you haven't saved in a while you might just want to do so before finding the exit
Careful
Don't step off the edge
Placing the wood cradle accurately lets you slide down the chute safely and reach the ship
Creating the exit for the cook is optional you could just go push the weight and get out
In addition if you rest the first day and find yourself in the upper room you can rest again finding yourself in the kitchen area again
Careful
If you rest a third time you can probably guess what happens
Not for the squeamish however
Having made your escape you are returned to Lamus
You need your clothing and sword so go visit Boros
This is the real Boros not Merops in drag he doesn't quite know what to make of you
Take your belongings and decide whether to kill Boros or be merciful
Now remember the L strygonians expect a toll for passage through the strait
The only way they know when someone sails through is if they are alerted by a horn
It's the job of the watchman on the upper level to blow the horn
Climb up there and crack the horn by stepping on it
Try leaving without breaking the horn to see what happens to toll gate crashers
Go into the lowest level of the house climb to the top of the stairs and talk with Circe
When she offers you a magic drink accept it
You are changed into a Piggy
Cute huh
Exit to downstairs and upon reaching the outdoors turn right West and go around the far side of the house up an earthen bank which gives you access to the next higher level
Go in and climb the stairs and find yourself on the rooftop
Turn right West again and continue that turn to climb up the next roof
Go around counter clockwise until you come to the last window which is conveniently open
You might have explored up here as Heriseus but the human cannot fit through the window the pig can
Go in and have a look around
See the green pillow next to the railing
Then four ropes tied to the railing
The object of all this is for you to retrieve one of the objects by biting through the rope
Unfortunately it will break upon landing below unless you do something to soften the impact
Start by biting the first rope and drop the stone below to dislodge the board that blocks the objects' falling path
Then take the green pillow and take the short cut into Circe's room directly down the stairs and through the one way gate
Place the pillow on the floor where you expect the object hanging from the second rope to land
Exit Circe's room
On the way out you overhear Merops talking with her and witness the attack
She is injured
Now re trace your route outside and over the roofs to return to the lab
Bite the second rope and let the bottle fall to the pillow
Go down through the gate pick up the bottle and take it to Circe
If you did not have a conversation with her about the potion you will now
Press Enter to give it to her
She is revived and so are you
Talk with her about Ulysses who it seems has gone to the Underworld
You must find a way to get there yourself
She goes on at length with instructions
Here's part of the transcript quot Turn towards the riverbed and wait
Many deceased souls will gather
But hold your sword against your leg do not move and do not let the dead ones approach the blood before Tiresias appears quot Return to your ship being careful not to trip on all the dead pigs on the way out
Looks like Merops decided the only good piggie is a dead piggie
He was trying to insure your demise
The ship takes you to the entrance of the Underworld then departs
It seems you will need a different means of departure
In Italian that says quot Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here quot That's what Dante said is inscribed over the Gates to Hell
Well I don't think so
Heriseus is made of better stuff than that
Go in and talk with the dead folk
As you make your way down the steps you will run into Koppeas
Talk with him and give him your gemstone in order to cut in line
Follow him to the boat and give your sword to Charon since you don't have any Zorkmids or Dramoi
He will give you a flute in return which will summon him at any time
On the other side ignore Cerberus the Three Headed Dog
Just RUN away from him or he will send you scouring for the latest saved game
Once you arrive at the ramp leading into Hades Headquarters you are safe
The paths here are varied
You must visit in any order Tartarus Hell the Elysian Fields and the Fields of Asphodels
Regardless of where they send you first you must finish the Episode in the Fields of Asphodels
If the gods have sent you to Asphodels first I suggest going elsewhere
The best sequence is Tartarus first then Elysium then finally the Asphodels
Ironically the Elysian Fields representing Heaven are the most unpleasant of the lot and Tartarus representing Hell is the easiest to deal with it
Go figure
So go to Hell do not pass Go
To summon Charon from Tartarus there is a small strand of beach between two large rocks
If you arrive there by way of the Styx take note of the scene so you can find your way out again
Whether you were brought by Charon or sent directly by the gods the correct direction to start out is West
Continue walking until you see Tantalus sitting under a tree to the North
Talk with him
He offers to provide some of the ingredients
Start by picking up the jar of Honey
It's on the ground near what looks like a cooked turkey
Walk straight ahead Southwest a couple of steps and pick up the Empty Glass
Step forward again and pick up another Empty Glass
Return to the pile of stuff and pick up an Empty Wineskin
That's a pretty good start one ingredient and three containers
Leave Tantalus and go West again
That's Merops standing out there on the point
Go past him and continue walking
Pick up a pebble from that bluish pile of rocks
Keep going and find Prometheus
That nasty bird is constantly picking at his wounds
Yuck
Throw the pebble at the bird to give Prometheus a break
A neat place to stand is atop that slanted rock
After the conversation use the Empty Wineskin to take some blood
After you leave Prometheus you can visit with Sysiphus if you like he's the one pushing the rock forever uphill
Beware do not offer to help him
Tantalus wanted some water
Let's see what we can do
Go East as far as you can go though part of it looks like North
Pass Charon's Landing and climb the hill where the Danaides are constantly filling the leaking cask with water
They say you shouldn't take any water but aww go ahead
Your little glass won't hold much
Indeed fill both glasses
One will be given to Tantalus
The other one will be used as the Water ingredient
Go to Tantalus and give him water
You can ask for any one ingredient I suggest getting the Barley Flour it's much easier than the method used in the Elysian Fields
You could ask for Wine instead it's also much easier than the Elysian fields where you have to negotiate a maze
Return to Charon's Landing and play the flute to summon him
Welcome to a Maze
It's not a very serious maze but one task is timed so there is no room for wandering
If you don't have the Barley Flour find the Little Girl who is baking flatbreads
Take a fresh loaf of bread to the people in the Rest Area
You must do it before the bread cools down or they won't have anything to do with you
If you make them happy the little girl will give you flour
If you asked Tantalus for Flour you can ignore her and the dead souls
If you don't have wine you need to find your way to the vineyard grey blocks in map and pick up the wineskin
It already contains wine no need to fill it
If you asked Tantalus for Wine you can skip this part
By now you should have Honey Wine Water Flour and Blood
Check to be sure
If you have everything find the Exit to the maze and call up Charon with the flute
If you need to summon Charon from here there is a small strand of beach between two large tropical plants
If you arrive there from one of the other lands take note of the scene so you can find your way out again
Just to the East of that spot is the altar where you will make the offerings
You must place them in the correct order
Any time you need the recipe it is in your inventory
Also the sequence is mentioned just above
The first four ingredients ask the dead souls to gather
Then the blood implores Tiresias to appear
Stand your ground
When the souls attempt to approach press Enter to drive them away with the Trident
Do not walk around
After a few attempts to reach your offering they will try to leave
Let them depart until there is only one left
He is Tiresias
Talk to him
He wants to honor your offering
Leave him alone a few moments then talk to him about Ulysses
He creates three crystals for you
Take them
Go toward the spot where he disappeared around the West side of that huge rock with the seven holes around the base
Place the crystals in the correct holes
The holes must be used in sequence
They appear to be randomized
When all three are placed there is a strange light coming from above
Find the path that leads to the top of that rock
It's just to the left of a clump of daisies
There is a glowing crystal in the wall
Touch it and you will be transported again to the Gates of Hell
This time do not enter the cave instead go Southeast toward the sea
Need I suggest saving your game
Poseidon will give you your five weapons
You must choose three of them and in the correct order
The correct answers are randomly selected just for you
Here is how to know if your choices are correct If Poseidon is unaffected by the weapon it is not one of the three
He zaps you
If he is slightly thrown off balance it is a correct weapon in the wrong sequence
He zaps you
If he is brought to his knees it is in the correct sequence
Do not take too many attempts to figure it out Enjoy the closing scenes
GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
a PrologueThis is the complete Walkthrough for Odyssey The Search for Ulysses by Cyro Interactive Entertainment The game has many different aspects that will effect the story
You can choose your own way to solve the puzzle although the linear and main puzzle still exist in order to complete the game
Think carefully before you do something or answer some questions some action and answer you choose will effect the story and make you die game over I've just shown the things that are must to do and some little aspect that influence the game that I've found
Also only use this walkthrough if you're really stuck
Try to solve the puzzle by yourself first and you will get so much more out and fun of the game
b Reviews b Major Good graphic with full realised d environment Good sound and music quality Complex story with mithology antiquity and legendary characters Rich puzzle solving some of the puzzle can be solved with more than one solution
So players can have much experiences with the game b Minor The gameplay system that not very efficient and easy to use
It's good if it's just point and click The camera system that little frustating i e When Heriseus fight the Gorgon The camera system is useless here absolutely not helping The changing view is really bad
What i mentioned is Sometimes the camera just exposed Heriseus
In this case how do we know about what Gorgon's doing where is she or when she start to attack And sometimes it's just changing view to Gorgon
When u move Heriseus to corner he will disappear and not available on the screen
If that so how u will act your character Maybe the camera system is good to be used in adventure mode but means nothing in the action mode
This is really annoying I've found that it might be some bug during my play The game sometime stop without any message error show up Load and Save game system
The game sometime won't load and telling something about the version I don't know why but it's bothering This is a little trick u can do for loading your game If u want to save your game First move your character to anywhere that not represent any things stuff and goods NPCs and maybe the door path or ways to go somewhere
Then save your game
This is may not work with other version of the game but it's work to me Another bug is sometime when Heriseus move to an background object house door windows rock or something it get stuck and just turn around over and over

Artifact Color Orb Sin Sin Room In regards to the Mask Room this is how you get to there upon starting the game click forward till you reach the Clock then turn slightly to your right and click forward down that street
You will now be facing the Hall of Pride
But just to the left of the Pride you will see revolving doors click towards these
Once inside the tunnel turn to your right and click forward when you're facing the giant Mask your cursor should become the grasping hand
Click on the giant Mask and then you will be transported to the Mask Room
The thing to do in here is to click on the colored stars that you see around the room
Upon clicking a colored star you will see three Apparitions appear
The Color star that you clicked corresponds to those three Apparitions
Now upon going on to Levels amp some of the Apparitions colors stay thesame but sometimes they donot so paycareful attention
You may then click upon each of the Apparitions faces when your cursor turns into the Victrolla Phonograph icon
You may in this way learn more about each Apparition Note there is also a Black star in this room which is a little difficult to see above a doorway but this particular star does not come into play until the second and third levels
Now when travelling through the village itself pick up all the Orbs and Trans Portals that you come across
Throughout the game whenever you have to use the Orbs to blast an Apparition the Orbs themselves will constantly re appear in more or less the same places where you originally found them though there is some variation among the three Levels There are also Black Orbs but these also do not come into play until the second and third Levels
Mastering the Trans Portals is very helpful using these will transport you instantaneously to a given spot
This is very advantageous when you are pressed for time with the impending Apocalypse
With the Trans Portals just remember where youwerewhen you used it it will be in that same exact spot when you come back to retrieve it
So keep your inventory stocked with Orbs and Trans Portals you're going to need them frequently
With the Trans Portals examine their appearence in your inventory highlighting them will help to view them better
Then use the Map supplied with your game to match them up this way you can see which Portal will take youwhere
Another feature in this game that is useful is using the Pause button that is located on your keyboard
This will freeze the game and stop the clock
Remember you are racing against time and the impending Apocalypse
Pausing is handy for when you want to stop and think something through or maybe to jot down some notes from something you just learned in the game
This way the clock isn't running
Besides the Black there are three colored Orbs Red Green and Blue
You will need to combine these three in different ways for the various Apparitions
Some just require a single Orb a Red a Green or a Blue
But for the other colors here is the combination of Orbs you must use Magenta Red amp Blue Cyan Light Blue Blue amp GreenDuring gameplay if you hear the voice over say Attention
You have one minute to send an Apparition back to the Dark Isle using White Light
If you do not the Apocalypse will soon be upon you In order to create White Light you must combine Red Blue and Green Orbs in your inventory and thenusethem
But to do this when you hear the announcement an Apparition must be within your sight
Sometimes they are actually present in the Village but if they are not you must then go to a Device room and find them
You may then blast them with White light
You cannot just blast the White light without having an Apparition present it will just be a waste of your Orbs As for the inventory itself this is how you access it click on the right mouse button this brings up the inventory
While still holding down on the right mouse button slide the mouse cursor over the desired item you want in your inventory and then click theleftmouse button this will highlight that item remember all the while to still be holding down on the right mouse button
Remember with the Orbs while holding down with the right mouse button you can left click on more than one orb for certain combinations e g
Red amp Green Yellow
This also applies when redeeming an Apparition besides clicking on the appropiate Orb s you must also click on the Artifact that belongs to the Apparition
So after selecting what you want from your inventory by highlighting it them exit inventory by letting go of the right mouse button
Then hit the Space Bar on your keyboard this will cause the items to beusedthat you had selected in your inventory
This will be for instance if you made some White Light to blast an Apparition back to the Dark Isle if you selected a Trans Portal or if you're redeeming an Apparition When you first start the game or another Level you'll notice that most of the Device Rooms are empty there will not be Apparitions or their Artifacts in the rooms
When they do appear you can click on the Apparition's faces and they will speak or you can put your cursor over the Artifacts themselves until the cursor turns into the Victrolla Phonograph icon click and then you will hear more information
But remember youCANNOTtake an Artifact while the Apparition isstill in the room with it During gameplay you may notice periodically flashes of different colors this means that Apparitions that correspond to that color have entered the village
This also means that their Artifacts are now available unguarded in their Device Room
You can also do this yourself if you desire a certain Artifact you can force an Apparition
Here's how if you are in a Device Room and the Apparitions are there with their Artifacts make some White Light from your inventory and blast them
But you will notice that this banishes them as well as their Artifacts
Then quickly go back out to the village and go to the Clock but make sure that yourbackis towards the Famine Room when you are facing the Clock
Now tilt your view upwards so you can see the stars on the Clock
Move your cursor over to the now darkened star that corresponds to the color of the Apparitions that you just blasted with White Light your cursor should now turn into the grasping hand
Click now on this star and you will see the appropiate color flash
Those Apparitions have now beenforcedout
You can now go quickly back to that Device Room and the Apparition's Artifacts will be there but the Apparitions themselves won't be
You can now take the Artifacts
Also you can take an Artifact out to the Clock and highlighting that Artifact in your inventory left click when your cursor turns into the Victrolla Phonograph icon underneath of the Clock this way you can learn more about the Artifact it's owner it's Sin etc
And try to make efficient use of taking Artifacts
Say for instance you notice that two Artifacts are both redeemed in the same Sin Room then take both and act accordingly Now there are Rooms and there arehiddenRooms
By this it means that certain Rooms are accessed by clicking on a certain something
This certain something turns out to be a star but not a colored star like on the Clock for instance
Here are the Rooms that have these stars In the Radiation Room turn to your left and you will see a star click on it and you will be taken to the Hall of Lust
After you've entered The Office click on the star on the desk and you'll be taken to the Hall of Anger
When in the War Room turn to your left and look for the star on the wall click on it and you'll be taken to the Hall of Accidie Sloth
When you first enter the Earth Shifts area click forward one more time and then look very carefully over at the wall on your left there's another star which will take you to the Hall of Avarice Greed
When you are in the street and facing the Hall of Pride turn to your right and you will see another star this will take you to the El Dorado Room You will notice while in the first Level that certain areas are not accessable to you yet
You'll notice that when you move your cursor over these areas the cursor becomes the walking feet icon but with a red slash mark going through them
If you were to click on it anyway the voice over would say Not this Level Then in Levels amp you'll notice that areas that were previously accessable to you in Level are now not available they are now Locked
By this it means that when you move your cursor over that Doorway your cursor now becomes a little black Padlock
If you click on this the voice over will say something like The Mirror The Guitar or The Cigar
This means that you must search for that item thatArtifact which is now also the Key that you need to unlock that little black Padlock
Once you have found the requested Key stand in front of that Doorway highlight the Key Artifact in your inventory exit inventory and thenleft clickyour mouse button in this instance DO NOT hit the Space Bar
This will open the locked door
It would now be a good idea to get rid of that Artifact Key in your inventory lest the Apparition that owns it comes after you
Once you've opened a locked door you don't need that Artifact for now that is until later when you want to redeem that particular Apparition
So after you've opened a locked door make sure that item is still highlighted in your inventory thenhit the Space Bar on your keyboard
This will get rid of the item in your inventory and send it back to the Device Room where you got it
Once a locked door has been un locked you can come and go back through it as you please you only need the Artifact Key that one time to open it At the end of Level after you've redeemed the Apparitions you have to go down to the Hall of Mirrors and attempt to solve the Orb puzzle you will see a pyramid rise out of the ground with receptacles around it to place the Orbs in
But don't worry it's not meant or supposed to be solved now
No matter what you try it will not work Gar Hob supposedly does something to switch them around just to thwart you
You will just go on to Level Now in Level you are going to notice some Artifacts in particular
These will be Skulls with colored eyes
These are Artifacts that you do not I repeat DO NOT want to hold onto for too long
These Artifacts belong to Dark Lords and if they catch you with them you will be punished severely
Some of the things they will do to you are depleting your inventory or God forbid put aCURSEon you
So to avoid any and all such things just don't keep these items in your inventory until absolutely necessary
For instance you need a Skull to open one of the locked doors get the Skull use it to open the locked door thenimmediately get rid of it from your inventory
Other than that save all three Skulls till the end till the last Note if you do happen to get caught by one of the Dark Lords with their Artifact and they punish you in some evil way of theirs it's best to just go back to a previous Saved Game
But if you don't want to do this refer to the Quick Reference Card which came with the game this will tell you what you must do for instance to purify yourself Also other areas in Level which will become available to you are The Abyss which is to the left in the tunnel when you first enter the Underground from the revolving door also The Nightly News which is to your left when you are in the Plague Room So in Level after you've redeemed all of the Apparitions except for the ones with the Skulls you need now to go down to the Hall of Mirrors again and solve the Orb puzzle
But this time you will have clues as to how to solve it
When you click on those Skull Artifacts when your cursor turns into the Victrolla Phonograph icon they will say things like Blue is before red or something akin to that
Clicking on each of the three Skulls is giving you clues as to the order in which to place the orbs
It will be different each time you play the game
Listen carefully to these clues and Save Game before attempting to solve the Orb Puzzle Note the word Before means to the Left of After you've solved the Orb Puzzle click towards the pyramid you will now be taken to the Dark Isle
Then enter the main doorway of the Dark Isle once inside click up the spiral staircase
At the top turn slightly to your left and notice the oval mirror
When you place your cursor over it you will see the little black Padlock
Click on it and it will tell you what Artifact Key that you need to open it
Actually that item should still be in your inventory just in case you haven't noticed it already
This is regardless of the fact that you may have already redeemed that particular Apparition which owned that Artifact
So in your inventory highlight the Artifact Key that the oval mirror with the Padlock asks for then left click on it this will open up this new Mirror Room
This will be the room in which you will redeem the three dark Lords that are left
This will be the tricky part you must be sly and quick
This is going to be a very opportune time to use one of the Trans Portals namely the Hall of Mirrors Trans Portal
Note make sure you have plenty of Orbs in your inventory you are going to need one of each Red Green Blue amp Black for the last Orb Puzzle in order to defeat Gar Hob
Because if you reach the part of the game where you are going to face the last Orb Puzzle and you don't have the proper Orbs in your inventory there is no going back to the Village so stock upNOW Now make your way back to the Village and go to one of the Device Rooms where you know one of the Dark Lords is with his Skull Artifact it would be best to Save Game before attempting this
If the Dark Lord is not there and his Artifact is then good just take the Artifact
But if not use the White Light trick to banish him go to the Clock click on the appropiate star to force him then go back to the Device Room and get the Skull O K don't panic
You need to waste some time here on purpose believe it or not
If you want you can go to the area just in front of the Hall of Mirrors wait there BUT here's what you must do access your inventory and highlight just the Hall of Mirrors Trans Portal
Now you will have to listen for something
The Dark Lords announce themselves when they are getting near you this may be something such as an evil laugh heavy breathing what have you
So as you are standing there when you hear the Dark Lord immediately hit your Space Bar on your keyboard and the Trans Portal that you had highlighted will take you directly to the Hall of Mirrors
Now also very quickly keep clicking forward to the pyramid Dark Isle up spiral stairs through oval Mirror and then when you are inside of here access your inventory highlight the Skull and the appropiate colored Orb exit inventory then hit the Space Bar on your keyboard
This will redeem the Dark Lord
You must now do this again for the two remaining Dark Lords
And as I mentioned before it's a good idea to Save Game before attempting to redeem any of the Dark Lords
Also remember to go back and get your Hall of Mirror Trans Portal it will be right where you left it when you just last used it After you've redeemed the three Dark Lords the Throne Room will now be accessible to you
The Throne Room is located just to the right of the oval Mirror where you just redeemed the three Dark Lords
In the Throne Room you will have one more Orb Puzzle to solve As mentioned earlier you should have stocked up on Orbs so now you have at least one Red one Green one Blue and one Black
Before you enter the Throne Room go back into the oval Mirror room where the three redeemed Dark Lords are you will be able to get clues from them on how to solve the last Orb Puzzle to defeat Gar Hob
Click on the faces of each of the Dark Lords
Sometimes you'll get lucky and each of them will give you adifferentclue other times each of the Dark Lords will give you thesameclue
It's basically the same as earlier with the pyramid Orb Puzzle e g Red is before Blue but not next to Black
And again it will be different each time you play the game even if you go back to the same Saved Game just before this puzzle
So when you've gotten your clues from the Dark Lords enter the Throne Room
Inside turn around and face Angel
She will give you one final clue on how to solve the final Orb Puzzle
The clues that you have received mayseemcontradictory or cryptic but carefully think about them and they will make a certain sense
When you think you've got it figured out place the Orbs in their respective receptacles
If you've figured it correctly Gar Hob will leave Angels body but if you've figured incorrectly Gar Hob will have some bad news for you So if you want to figure out the Apparition's Sin and Artifacts yourself read the Book of the Damned manual on each Apparition when in the Mask Room click on each of the faces when in a Device Room click on the Apparition's face when in a Device Room click on an Artifact when you have an Artifact in your possession take it out to the Clock and click it underneath of it doing this under the Clock has the Apparition's victim tell you something
Doing all of these things will give information on who a given Artifact belongs to and information on what Sin a given Apparition is guilty of so you know what Sin Room to go to
But if you still can't figure it out after all of this look below and you will find a list of what you need it will be listed in the order of Apparition Artifact amp Sin As for the inventory itself this is how you access it click on the right mouse button this brings up the inventory
While still holding down on the right mouse button slide the mouse cursor over the desired item you want in your inventory and then click theleftmouse button this will highlight that item remember all the while to still be holding down on the right mouse button

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS GAME GUIDE WALKTHROUGH By The Fellowship of the Quest It is not possible to create a traditional step by step walkthrough for ldquo Of Light and Darkness rdquo OLAD Many of the object locations in the game are randomly generated and change from game to game Some of the sequencing challenges are also randomly generated
The first sections of this Guide describe some of what is going on in the game and give suggestions for learning its secrets There is even a section near the end of the Guide which includes comments on the game rsquo s philosophy More than many other games OLAD gives the gamer a lot to think about
If you find that you want more specific direction look toward the middle of this Guide for lists of hints and spoilers OLAD rsquo S TUTORIAL BENEFITING FROM THE FREE TOUR Use the Free Tour in each level to explore the game before you take on the real challenges An airline stewardess voice instructs you in the important aspects of gameplay In Free Tour you can get an idea of where the transportals and orbs are ndash though which PARTICULAR transportal is at which PARTICULAR location will randomly generate when you start the real game Wander around to each location at least twice and listen to the videos with Angel and Gar Hob This way you learn details about the plot but you don rsquo t have to use up time in the real game to listen to these videos
At the very beginning of the game you can use the Free Tour to get oriented in the Village ndash it rsquo s a beautiful place but odd enough and confusing enough that you rsquo ll need to wander in it before getting your bearings At the very beginning of the game you can use the Free Tour to familiarize yourself with using inventory which is a bit tricky To use the inventory items hold down the right mouse button keep holding it as you move the cursor over the item s you wish to select and click on them with the left mouse button they will highlight when you click on them Next release both mouse buttons then hit the space bar this activates the inventory items
Practice White Light Flashing WLFing In Level One Free Tour you can go to Poisoned Air after a yellow flash and practice WLFing an apparition named Mani WLFing in the presence of apparitions delays the apocalypse thereby buying you more game time Hold down the right mouse button then left click on a red orb a green orb and a blue orb
Check to make sure that a red green and blue orb is highlighted Release the mouse buttons Then hit the space bar You will hear a kind of howl as Mani disappears You will use this process many times once you start the real game when the airline stewardess gives you a one minute warning before the apocalypse In levels Two and Three you can use the Free Tour to find out the locations that are locked you will be given a universal key for these locations in Free Tour so you can see inside places without having to unlock them with their particular artifacts THE MAP IS YOUR FRIEND Study the map The map is the small black insert that is separate from the manual It has icons on one side and pictures of the artifacts on the other
The game will be easier if you recognize the icons for some of the portals There are rooms for each of the Seven Deadly Sins ndash Gluttony Lust Anger Envy Pride Avarice Greed and Accidie Sloth There are also rooms for each of the apocalyptic devices ndash Poisoned Air Radiation Earth Shifts Famine Flood Plague and War These are not the only rooms ndash there are other places to explore ndash but these are the rooms where most of the action will take place
You will not always have access to the transportal that belongs to every location It rsquo s a good idea to use the map to figure out which transportal will at least get you close For instance you may not have an ldquo Anger rdquo transportal but Anger can be accessed easily through ldquo Flood rdquo or through ldquo Office rdquo ndash if you rsquo ve wandered through the village picking up transportals you rsquo re likely to have at least one of the three NOTE if you do not have a map there is a description of the map at the end of this Game Guide
THE MANUAL Read the manual Yes you have to Although in most games you can toss the manual over your shoulder and forget about it in OLAD you won rsquo t get very far until you have READ THE MANUAL Also it will add a lot of enjoyment to your game If you can only manage to get through part of the manual then be sure to read PAGES to
An explanation of OLAD rsquo s unusual gameplay
PAGES to If you read the Apparition Stories it is possible to make an informed guess as to the sin enjoyed suffered through by each of the bad guys This knowledge will save you considerable time in making decisions later on as the game clock ticks down
THERE rsquo S NO PLACE LIKE HOME IN THE VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED As you begin each level save your game and work from that save ndash this will keep the orb and transportal locations from randomly regenerating Start by familiarizing yourself with what needs to be done Use the Mask room to identify the apparitions you rsquo ll need to redeem and what their colors are Find out whose artifacts are whose The apparitions will tell you themselves once you have picked up their artifacts
A Note from Becky Plan on having a notebook and taking notes You will not finish the game unless you do this Use the ldquo pause rdquo button to stop the clock while you are taking notes If you hate taking notes proceed immediately to the Hall of Accidie then exit the game and give OLAD to a friend who doesn rsquo t mind taking notes
The game gives you information about each character rsquo s background to help you identify her sin You can click on her mask in her apocalyptic device room You can click on her artifact in her apocalyptic device room You can click on her mask in the Mask room All these actions will give you bits of information with varying degrees of helpfulness
You can also carry the artifact to the star clock globe and with your back to the MFer studio highlight the artifact in inventory and left click on the Victrola sound icon near the base of the clock This will give you even more information And if that doesn rsquo t work guess
On each level keep yourself well stocked with orbs always pan around each location to look for them and use WLFing every so often to keep the airline stewardess off your back Otherwise don rsquo t worry about the clock running out You rsquo ll have plenty of time to do what needs to be done Also keep in mind WHERE there is an apparition in case you need a quick White Light Flash this becomes especially important as you near the end of each level and have only a few bad guys left
The game will be easier if you understand the path the apparitions take They leave the Dark Isle when their color flashes the Dark Isle is accessible to the gamer only on Level Three pop into the Hall of Mirrors exit the Hall of Mirrors at the point closest to their apocalyptic device room and then home in on their artifacts in the apocalyptic device room If you want artifacts grab the artifacts AFTER the correct color flashes but BEFORE the artifact rsquo s owners return to their apocalyptic device room
If you are carrying the apparitions rsquo artifacts their path changes Once out of the Hall of Mirrors they will move toward you and attempt to home in on YOU Using a transportal shakes them off temporarily but they will eventually find you If you stop moving they attempt to block you If you drop their artifacts by highlighting the artifact in inventory then hitting the space bar they will forget about you and toddle back to their apocalyptic device room There are two locations where they can rsquo t follow you ndash the MFer studio and the Mask room
To redeem an apparition take the apparition rsquo s artifact to the apparition rsquo s sin room pride anger etc
In inventory highlight the artifact AND the orb s that match the color of the apparition rsquo s apocalyptic device Release both mouse buttons and hit the space bar The bad guy will shriek the camera will suddenly turn to reveal the apparition and you will hear the judge pronouncing judgment Last of all Gar Hob hobnobs with the redeemed apparition these conversations are some of the funniest in the game Redeeming an apparition like WLFing one extends gameplay for another few minutes
A Note from Rckasea Now along with the matching artifact I went to a sin room and waited
Bad move I finally figured that no one was coming and went to another sin room
There was the apparition that I needed to redeem and redeem I did
Well this plan has clock issues big time
After doing this for a bit while waiting in a sin room I just thought heck I'll just do it
Big surprise it worked
The apparition does NOT have to be present in his her sin room to be redeemed
If you try to free an Apparition in for instance the Hall of Pride and Pride turns out to be the wrong sin the artifact you use will simply return to its place in its apocalyptic device room You can go back if the color flash hasn rsquo t changed and pick up the artifact again and try in another sin room In other words the artifacts are re useable
UNDERSTANDING THE CLOCK At the beginning of each level you will see a momentary color flash As time passes another color will flash randomly The momentary color flashes are generated by the stars on the globe clock in the middle of the Village At the beginning of each level only one apocalyptic device room has artifacts ndash the room that matches the color that flashes as the level begins As each star flashes the artifacts appear in the apocalyptic device room that matches that color You can only remove the artifacts from a particular room when their star on the clock is ldquo active rdquo the most recent color flashed
There is a way to manipulate the clock during the first seven random flashes When the level first begins you can force the clock to flash any color that hasn rsquo t already been flashed To do this you will need to be at the angle facing the clock where the Hall of Famine is behind you and the Hall of Flood is just on your left From this angle look up at the clock If you place a cursor over the stars whose colors have not yet flashed you will see a grasping hand Clicking with the grasping hand forces the star to flash the color you want AFTER seven colors have flashed in a random sequence there is a simple though slow way to control which color flashes next To control the color of the next momentary flash and if you don rsquo t mind waiting until the clock ticks down for the next flash to occur use WFLing on an apparition or apparitions that match the color you want for the next flash Then wait until the clock ticks down The color you want will then flash But what if you want to force a color to flash that has already flashed earlier in the level and you want to do so IMMEDIATELY To accomplish this go into the apocalyptic device room of your choice at least one of the owner apparitions has to be present Flash White Light which will cause both the apparitions and the objects to disappear Go to the clock and click the grasping hand on the colored star for that apocalyptic device The correct color will immediately flash When you go back to the apocalyptic device room the artifacts will be there and the owners won rsquo t so you can strip the device of the artifacts and run off to use them before the bad guys get back
Note it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the color of the stars on the ldquo forcing rdquo side of the globe clock but you can go to the other side of the clock to make a note their position
Note occasionally even though you do everything right the grasping hand cursor does not appear over the star you wish to force If this happens just try again It USUALLY works
GENERAL GAME HINTS greatest spoilage occurs at the bottom While playing through each level remember to save your game Saving your game in the right places will eliminate a lot of repetition There is something about this game ndash perhaps the timed factor
ndash that makes it hard to remember to save The last two settings on the MFer radio in the MFer studio have the most to do with the game rsquo s plot
You can left click to stop conversations these do take up time while the clock ticks down
After the clock goes through the first seven color flashes it rsquo s safest to always have a red blue and green orb in your inventory as well as a transportal to an apocalyptic device room where you know an apparition is hanging out That way if the Stewardess gives you the one minute warning you are completely prepared
A Note from Rckasea I kept one apparition as a shadow
This was Droessus as I thought he would be one of the last to redeem
I used him to white light a few times and stop the clock
I picked him back up time and time again This really helped after I redeemed one or two and the countdown gives you sixty seconds
I would white flash him pick more orbs and artifacts and him and go on
Once you have freed an apparition if you go to the Mask room that apparition will no longer appear when you click his her star This helps if you can rsquo t remember which apparitions you rsquo ve redeemed and which you haven rsquo t
There are rooms that only can be reached by clicking on hotspots All of these hotspots are in the shape of a star ndash some are easy to spot while others are pretty difficult Three rooms that are especially hard to find El Dorado as you face the Hall of Pride look to your right and pass the cursor over the wall of the building until you find the correct blue star
Accidie Sloth when you enter the War room look to your left There is a star on the wall that is the same color as the wall
Avarice Greed go as far as you can into Earth Shifts ndash looking down you see the fiery lava Look to your left where you will see a small globe Above the globe is a very faint star
A Note from Becky who are the MFers Well according to the manual the MFers used to be Druids
They made some kind of deal with Saman Dark Lord of Millenium Five who maybe isn't such a Dark Lord after all
He is functionally Evil but only under duress Anyway Saman gave the Druid MFers powers to help mankind fight the Dark Lords in the future
It is they who gave us the clock to give us time to figure out how to defeat Gar Hob
Somehow in the process they have survived all these centuries to become rock stars Well they rsquo ve actually become rock star voices You never see their bodies It would be interesting to watch them in concert
HINTS AND SPOILERS FOR LEVELS TWO AND THREE Things change a bit on Levels Two and Three
A Note from Becky Level Two brings in new color orbs The manual refers to these as ldquo black rdquo orbs I thought of them the entire time as ldquo white rdquo orbs In the Mask room there is a black star above the door ndash this can be clicked on for apparition information just like the colored stars around the rest of the Mask room
On Levels Two and Three some of the rooms are locked Click on the lock icon and you will hear the artifact that unlocks it After acquiring the correct artifact approach the locked door highlight the artifact in inventory then left click on the key icon on the door to the locked area
In Level Two the Passage of Time is locked And in Level Three Flood and the Passage of Time are locked This blocks your access to several more rooms Once you know which artifact keys unlock these doors it might be worthwhile to force the clock so as to get these particular keys and open the doors early in the level
A Note from Annie You don rsquo t need to worry about losing a quot key quot if you redeem a spirit
I remember early on noticing I still had the singing stone after I had redeemed Kabungabuna or what ever his name is and realized I needed it to unlock a door
BEFORE redeeming the last apparition in Level Two make sure that you have at least one red orb one blue orb and one green orb in inventory You will need these very soon after redemption to use in a puzzle
Immediately after redeeming the last apparition in Level Two you are supposed to place orbs on the pyramid in the Hall of Mirrors The MFers give you very confusing directions as to how to do this Don rsquo t worry if you get the order wrong ndash there is no RIGHT order Gar Hob changes the order of the orbs so you cannot win at this point
On Level Three there are skull artifacts whose Dark Lord owners will take them back if they catch you Since you need the skulls to unlock doors leave them be until you know where to use them If you are about to take an artifact from a Dark Lord it rsquo s a good idea to save right before removing the artifact
Once you have used a skull to open a door drop it immediately to keep its owner from cursing you
Dark Lords will also sometimes slurp up all the items in your inventory if they catch you
If you are cursed you won rsquo t be able to use your inventory items until you are purified
If you want to purify yourself go into the Abyss purification room next to the Underground and flash an orb that matches the color of that particular Dark Lord Dark Lords are either green blue or red If you don rsquo t know which Dark Lord cursed you use an orb in the Abyss room then exit and return When you use the correct orb upon your return you will no longer hear the ldquo You have been cursed rdquo message
Pay attention to what the skulls tell you when you click on them in their apocalyptic device rooms This will give you the information you will need to place orbs in the correct order around the pyramid in the Hall of Mirrors
Level Three also features four extra bad meanies Shakem the Sheep guy Apparition of Miser is the worst of these meanies If he catches you with his artifact he will hide all the artifacts you have in a bag in a certain room El Dorado If you haven rsquo t already unlocked this room you rsquo ll be in big trouble If you can get in to El Dorado simply click on the bag to get the artifacts back
The Apparitions of Wrath Marcello and Caligula will toss you without warning into a room in the Village the Mask room seems to be a popular destination The Apparition of Spendthrift Marie Antoinette will take all your artifacts and whisky them back to their apocalyptic devices Sooo once again use the artifact to unlock a room and then drop it immediately A Note from Annie BTW white light does not work on the four special apparitions when they rsquo ve chased you down and are trying to get their objects back
You can try moving to another location but I've found I never have enough time
The only other option you have is to relinquish the object which really gets up my nose In Level Three not all apparitions are redeemed in the standard sin rooms Some are redeemed in Nightly News El Dorado and the Sin Room in the Dark Isle
The conversation in Nightly News is between Caligula and Carlos Marcello The conversation in El Dorado is between Marie Antoinette and Shakem
In Level Three when you are trying to reach the Dark Isle it helps to save your game immediately before placing orbs on the stands surrounding the pyramids If you get the order wrong you will lose all inventory
There is one transportal that will save you a lot of trouble on Level Three It rsquo s the transportal to the Dark Isle It rsquo s the only transportal icon that has red lines in it I found it in two different locations in Level Three Usually it is right by the elevator in the Hall of Mirrors Stand in the elevator and face toward the Hall of Mirrors look down to your right ndash it is sitting on the floor It also appeared twice in the Hall of Plague the one with the large heart Sometimes I couldn rsquo t find the transportal in either of these locations but I discovered that if I went to the Dark Isle WITHOUT freeing a Dark Lord and then returned it was always in its location next to the elevator
Once you have the Dark Isle transportal do NOT use it immediately after a color flash This will send you straight to the Dark Isle before the apparitions leave it and you will find it very hard to shake them off
BEFORE redeeming the last apparition in Level Three make sure that you have at least one orb of each color red green blue black white You will need these soon for a puzzle
For the final challenge in the throne room you can get extra clues by going to the Dark Isle Sin Room Here you rsquo ll find the chastened owners of the skull artifacts who will give you one or two hints to use in the final room
Cheating the Apocalypse One Ugly Little Spoiler
If you refer to the lists below describing which artifact matches which apparition you can eliminate reading the Apparition Stories in the manual AND you can eliminate the need to visit the Mask room All you really need to know to redeem apparitions which artifact gets which color orb s in which sin room At the beginning of each level drop by each apocalyptic device room note the artifacts there look at this Guide for the color of that particular device room and look at this Guide for the sin that matches the artifact

Locations of the transportals ndash these randomly regenerate each time you enter a level for the first time Once you rsquo ve saved your game in that level they USUALLY appear in the same place though they are also not completely consistent Individual apparition apocalyptic devices colors ndash this sometimes stays the same for each level and each new game but sometimes does not For example the flower could be in Famine red in Level One Famine red again in Level Two but then show up in Earth Shifts green in Level Three
The pyramid puzzle ndash the sequence of orbs for this puzzle is most random
In the end game ndash the order of the orbs you place on the throne always changes even if you return to a saved game
A few of the apparitions never make it into a particular game Which apparitions are benched changes with each game
EXTRA THE PHILOSOPHY OF OLAD Warning ndash Plot Spoilers Annie If you are philosophically inclined the game is an invitation to think about what sin means
The Seven Deadly Sins are of course not original to OLAD They date back at least to the sixth century and pop up in all kinds of literary works such as Dante rsquo s Inferno What makes them deadly is that they are all sins against the self soul murder I think it rsquo s interesting that by contrast the Law at least in the west will let you murder your soul all you want but punishes sins against others
The Seven Deadly Sins corrupt you and separate you from the Other They are also only thoughts and feelings The manual says only these thoughts and feelings lust anger avarice are sinful not the actions they lead to rape murder theft which I think is rather hard cheese for the victims of these actions
I have some problems with all this If I am already damned because of a sinful thought and if for instance murder is no sin what is to stop me from just murdering everyone The manual says that actions cannot be changed and therefore the harm cannot be undone but the thought can be therefore recognizing the sinfulness of the thought can lead to redemption But the victims stay harmed
Are thoughts and feelings really wicked After all they come ldquo unbidden rdquo As small children we have most of these thoughts and feelings all the time and it rsquo s only when we have gained enough maturity and detachment that they lose their hold on us Perhaps they are only sinful if you ldquo clutch them to your bosom rdquo that is if you nurture them allow them to fester and to corrupt you Otherwise I think we are all in big trouble
Becky What struck me most about the game was the way it merged things that were ancient and modern Terror of ecological disasters is a modern problem whereas the concept of sin is ancient Many of the prophecies quoted in the device rooms were ancient while the rock music and radio show were modern The graphics were surrealistic though traditional in their beauty and realism The apparition masks were stylized and reflected a recent emphasis on the diversity of cultures
The game was also tied directly into an at the time upcoming event ndash the new Millennium I think the game used this mix as a way of expressing the belief that while there is constant change in the world ndash technological and cultural change civilizations rising and falling ndash some things stay the same The Apparition Stories show that human nature has changed very little in six millennia
What surprised me most about the game was that the Dark Lord had a sense of humor I didn rsquo t expect this at all Imagine Sauron engaged in light banter with his minions
I finally decided that the game itself with its stories of past sin and violence and human failing would have been too dark without Gar Hob the bailiff and the MFers cracking an occasional joke The Abyss room and the Sin Room on the Dark Isle puzzled me quite a bit I think the objects in those rooms represent the seven deadly sins all of which were enjoyed by the Dark Lords the costume represents Pride the red mask represents Anger the heart shaped mirror ndash Lust the liquor bottle Gluttony the pierced globe ndash Avarice money makes the world go around and the trap like maze mdash Accidie I have been trying to connect the fan to the sin of Envy but cannot find any way to do so except through a pun I also came to the conclusion that we The Chosen One or Messiah are in part an agent of the MFers Our feet are jester feet either that or we are wearing very odd bedroom slippers and the MFers rsquo studio icon is that of the jack in the box jester For some reason we have to become a fool in order to do the job of saving the world

Mordack explains theWater pumpset up as The valve in the manhole has to be turned on and the water pump has to be powered by the four batteries floating above the town in parallel
The diagram of the four batteries shows that one lead from each of the four batteries runs to each of the switch boxes
In other words four batteries leads total leads going to two switch boxes
The fixed switch box shows that the battery ldquo rdquo lead is positive battery ldquo rdquo lead is negative and battery ldquo rdquo and ldquo rdquo are connected together
To get the water pump working we need battery couples put in parallel as seen in the upper diagram of the documentation
With this documentation and the fixed switch information we know that battery ldquo rdquo has to be switched to positive and battery ldquo rdquo has to be negative and that batteries ldquo rdquo and ldquo rdquo have to be connected together
This makes the pump operate and water available in the fountain
Thanks Mordack
Arrange the yellow top left to point up andred bottom left to point left Arrange gray top right to point down and blue bottom right to point up to connect each other

Tex Murphy Overseer A WalkthroughByDan KennedyDecember Introduction You can't help but admire a long complex game that throws the kitchen sink at you a futuristic San Francisco with a 's feel inventory puzzles the guy who played Basil Exposition in Austin Powers full motion video cut scenes Jack Nicholson's ex girlfriend in a bad blond wig lots of logic puzzles a dark political conspiracy VR environments and Ron Howard's brother Clint playing a mutant
Here are some handy hints for playing the game This walkthrough has been written for Gamer mode since I feel most game players can complete the game at this level
However if you are looking for a walkthrough that will maximize the number of points awarded to you during the game you best look elsewhere this one concentrates on simply getting you through the game
Beginnings Begin by watch the opening credits some of the themes present here will be repeated throughout the game including time chess crazy old men screaming people hellip general mayhem
The game begins with at a cut scene involving Tex being woken up from a nightmare by a call from his sort of girlfriend Chelsee
Have fun with the conversation that follows any choice of dialogue path will get you safely over to Chelsee's apartment for your hot date
The next cut scene sets the stage for the story Chelsee wants to have a serious relationship with Tex but is bothered by a girl from Tex's past
Tex agrees to give her all of the details about Sylvia Linsky and his first case as a private investigator
The scene shifts to a younger looking Tex looking lonely and bored in his empty office
We are then placed into the office environment
Office Space Tex's office is a great place to practice the keyboard movement overlay controls for exploring the VR environments
The movement allows you to look under furniture around corners and get different perspectives on the same object
The kicker is that you really have to ferret out the clues for instance unless you are correctly positioned to see into each of the filing cabinet shelves you may miss the clues and items hidden within
There are several objects to examine and pick up in the office environment
Pick up and examine the magazine located on the floor by the main office door
Any item that can be moved or picked up will have a quot moving chess piece quot symbol on it in addition to the quot magnifying glass quot look at symbol
Notice that the item does not stay in inventory after you have looked it over whenever items are unimportant or lose their usefulness they will automatically be deleted from inventory
Pick up Tex's PI guidebook off his desk and examine it
Also grab the tape measure located on the bookshelf immediately to the right of Tex's bedroom door the door to the right of the desk
Be sure to play with Tex's perpetual motion machine over by the fax machine
Have a look through the two filing cabinets to the left of Tex's desk
Notice that each shelf has to be opened separately using a quot chessboard set quot symbol
Look in the bottom drawer of the left most cabinet pick up and examine the toy mouse
The filing cabinet to the right of Tex's desk also has a note from Tex's former employer in the bottom drawer it's an amusing read
Tex's vidphone is located on his desk click on it and hit the quot turn on off quot symbol to start it up
If Tex has any messages waiting his quot Message quot button will be flashing red
Access the American Information Database by clicking on the name in the top right panel hit the dial button and upon connection hit the quot Ask About quot dialogue path
A notepad with a selection of topic choices will be displayed
Click on the topic in this case it's Tex Murphy and hit quot Done quot when you are finished
To exit the database hit quot End Conversation quot and then the Exit button
A fax will arrive a few seconds later with an accompanying voice message click on the fax to place it in inventory and examine it
Faxes are always disposed of immediately after reading
Take a trip into Tex's bedroom next and look around at his stuff yikes what a meager existence
Check out his stellar wardrobe in the cabinet and drawers below
Click on the Parcheesi game lying on his cot to initiate the next cut scene which involves Sylvia Linsky hiring you to investigate her father's death
Isn't that dress a bit snug
Your next step is to visit the police station and speak to Detective Eve Clements
Open the location panel on the left side of the screen or open Tex's front door and click to leave and proceed to the police station
All About Eve After a short cut scene you strike up a conversation with Detective Eve who as a friend of your old boss the Colonel is a little belligerent
However don't worry about the conversation path each thread leads to her allowing you to ask a few questions
Remember to ask about everything for instance a question about Carl Linsky will lead to further information about his suicide note and some mysterious surgery
Once you have exhausted the lines of questioning end the conversation and go to Carl Linsky's apartment
Another scene with you and Sylvia leads into an opportunity to ask a few questions
She then leaves to pick up her father's effects from the police station leaving you to look around in the old man's apartment
Apartment Hunting Begin in Carl's living room a comfy couch a roaring fire and hellip a game of dominoes
Grab and examine the piece of paper on the coffee table
The note suggests combining blackjack and dominoes and the reverse side is even more explicit horizontal vertical and diagonal
Now pick up and examine the domino set this sends you into the first puzzle of the game
Simply follow the instructions on the note the dominoes must be placed so that the sum of all dots in each row and column and the two diagonals must equal
Ignore the two different numbers on each domino just add up the total number of dots on each when adding the totals together
There are a number of solutions to this puzzle one of which is displayed below
Don't let the time counting down in the upper left corner of the screen freak you out this is not a timed puzzle
The amount of time you take to complete the puzzle affects the number of points that is allotted to you upon completion
After completing the puzzle Tex notices that lights are flashing next to the dominoes with and dots
Remember this for later
Try the kitchen next
There are a lot of shelves and cupboards to look through but there are actually one two items of interest
The first is within plain sight on the counter just to the left of the fridge looks like Carl may have had a quot hard habit to break quot
The other item is in the fridge notice anything that shouldn't be there
That's right Carl's bananas are going to go all brown and funky unless you take them out of there
Examine both items before proceeding to Carl's bedroom located across from the kitchen
Go directly to Carl's desk and pick up the note on the surface
Looks like he was writing a quot Dear Delores quot letter
Have a peek in the middle desk drawer for a note from Carl's publisher demanding his manuscript
Proceed over to the left bedside table and pick up Carl's address book from the drawer
This provides Delores' address for a later visit
Walk around the bed and examine the chess set on the other bedside table note that it's missing a chess piece
Be sure to check out the dresser drawers for the opportunity to grab some new hellip underwear
Go to Carl's attic next from the living room open the door just to the left of the bedroom door
Proceed up the ladder to the attic
Carl's attic contains lots of furniture boxes crates and soiled mattresses but there really isn't anything of interest here
Proceed around the corner watch those horns
and enter Carl's home office
Have a listen to the tape recorder on the table to the left experiment in process I guess
Look through the two filing cabinets there's a threatening note in the third drawer from the top of the right hand cabinet
Note that the credenza is locked we'll have to come back to open up this one
Open up the top of Carl's desk and peruse Sylvia's credit rating yeeecccch
Now its time to interrogate the mysterious Delores Lightbody sic
She's Not Heavy and She's Not my Sister Again just sit back and enjoy the conversation with Delores all conversation paths end with her allowing you to ask as many questions as you like
She doesn't think much of Sylvia and suggests that Carl's daughter is untrustworthy
Once done it's a good time to head back to Carl Linsky's apartment to have a word with Sylvia
The cut scene involving Sylvia yields Carl's effects from the police station although you manage to make Sylvia pretty angry
She'll get over it
Examine the effects the manila envelope contains keys a copy of the suicide note and Carl's wallet
Go back up to the attic proceed to Carl's office and use the small key marked to open the locked credenza
In the top left drawer you will find a lease agreement for some warehouse space complete with address
None of the other drawers contain anything of note
Before proceeding to the warehouse you might take this opportunity to go back to Tex's office and use the database to gather information on some of the names and places you've heard about during the investigation
The search yields a number of faxes to look over none of the information is critical but adds some detail to the characters and story
Best Little Warehouse Not in Texas A virtual treasure trove of items to examine and take
Start with the conspicuous looking cardboard box in the centre of the room
Open it up and pick up the circuit repair kit inside as Tex says this may come in handy later on
Next proceed to Carl's cot and move the pillow to reveal some sleeping pills hidden here these could be useful
Is that a letter sitting in Carl's in box on the table next to the cot
Pick it up and examine someone named Wanda Peck was causing some trouble for Carl
Have a look through the drawers on the drafting table behind you there's a bunch of deposit slips credited to Carl's account indicating someone has been sending money
In the top drawer you'll find a newspaper article about the poisoning death of Ronda Morgan a former employee of a company named Gideon Enterprises
Carl must have been interested enough in this to clip and save the story
There are a bunch of notes and messages on the bulletin board between the tables but none of it is relevant
However move the board over and grab a note with quot HIP S O P quot scrawled on it
Could this be another password or code
Have a quick look at the computer we'll need to find a pass card reader and a pass card of course to operate this equipment
Both the middle and bottom drawers of the filing cabinet located left of the computer contain interesting notes
The first is a hand written fax to Linsky from quot SF quot concerning the deaths of people on an unknown list
The second note is a memo about the use of the pass card reader for information and transmission security and something about a project
Carl's notes at the bottom mention quot SF quot again and refer to someone named quot Overlord quot
The mystery deepens
Proceed to the first aid kit on the left wall and open it to reveal a container of Band Aids
Examine the container and pieces of a pass card will fall out
There's a piece missing so we'll need to keep an eye out for it later on
Now look at the boxes on the top shelf of the shelves behind the step ladder
The boxes can be moved to reveal hellip a swimsuit calendar hellip which in turn can be moved to reveal hellip a safe
The safe is protected by a numerical password
Now do we have any numerical codes in our inventory
Well the domino game gave us quot quot
Try punching in and hit enter
Success
The safe contains a pass card reader hmm hellip useful and the much talked about life insurance policy listing Sylvia as the benefactor
Putting it to Bed Since we don't have an operational pass card right now there isn't much more we can do here
Open up the location panel and proceed back to your office
Your vidphone should be indicating that you've got a message waiting
Just hit the message button to replay a drunken quot come hither quot message from Sylvia
This action sends you into several cut scenes that play out without any interaction needed
Of course Tex goes to Sylvia's place to take care of her and afterward we get to see a touching scene in which Tex and Chelsee first meet
Next Tex tells us that he's gotten an appointment with Arnold Sternwood at the North Hill Clinic and we are transported directly there
Your conversation with Arnold Sternwood is idiot proof all conversation paths end with his approval to be questioned
Depending on your path you may find out what Arnold thinks of Sylvia she really isn't the most popular of people
Be sure to exhaust your questions for Arnold
He gives you information about Wanda Peck and her organization C A P R I C O R N
Once you are finished proceed to C A P R I C O R N
's headquarters to interview Wanda Peck
No need to worry about the introductory conversation with Wanda no matter how many times Tex hits on her she is still receptive to some serious questioning
We learn a little about the Law and Order party and a few other tidbits
Now what to do
Who would be close enough to Carl Linsky to know who or what quot S F quot is
Well Delores Lightbody knew him best over the last few months try visiting her once again
Choose whatever conversation path you want and ask her about all available topics including quot S F quot
Turns out it stands for Sonny Fletcher
Go back to your office now and access the vidphone database
Do a search for all available topics and read the faxes for some in depth information
You must read the fax on Sonny Fletcher looks like he's been in some trouble with the law but we still don't know where to go to find him
Who would have information on a felon
Why Detective Clements
Proceed back to the police station and talk with Eve select any responses you wish and be sure to ask about everything particularly the questions about Sonny Fletcher and his checkered past
The detective is kind enough to supply Sonny's address
Go on over to Sonny's place
Easy Pieces Sonny lives is a real nice place
Choose whatever conversation path you like with Sonny and watch the extended cut scene with Tex interrogating the broken down P I
Sonny finally gives Tex a bishop that Carl had given him
Back at Tex's office examine the bishop looks like the final piece of the pass card is hidden in the chess piece's base
Grab the lone piece out of inventory and click on the rest of the pieces to combine the two together
Then examine the completed set of pieces
This puzzle requires you to assemble the pieces of the pass card so that they form a rectangle
Use the black strip as a guide to placing the pieces
Turn each piece around by clicking the left mouse button on the piece and while holding the button down hit the left or right arrow keys on the keyboard
The solution is shown below Examine the quot E quot pass card that you have now created
Pass card plus pass card reader equals COMPUTER ACCESS
Proceed back to the warehouse and attach the pass card reader to the computer just hold the pass card reader and click on the computer its that simple
Then grab the pass card and click on the reader
Now we need a password
Remember the letters on the note we found behind the bulletin board HIP S O B
Think about where we found the last piece of the pass card while you are re arranging the letters hellip that's right BISHOP
Type the password into the computer and read Carl Linsky's message from beyond the grave ooh scary
He gives us the name of another lead Bosworth Clark and the address of an office in Fresno which may further the case
Proceed to the office at the Fresno address
This place is pretty empty but notice the electric bill by the door mail is still being delivered this is important later
There is an address book located on a packing box near the wall map
Examining it will reveal three appointments in three cities San Francisco Paris and Sydney on three different days plus a cryptic message sets of
The map on the wall reveals more information Sydney time PM is hours ahead of Paris time PM which is in turn hours ahead of San Francisco time AM
Moving the bookcase along the opposite wall reveals a safe attached to the commemorative plate display hanging on the wall
Click on one of the plates to start another puzzle
The object here is to enter each appointment time on the appropriate clock with the corresponding times on the other two clocks
Set the time on the first clock the picture of the Golden Gate Bridge indicates that this is San Francisco to the San Francisco appointment time PM
Paris is hours ahead so set the Paris Eiffel Tower clock to AM
Sydney is another hours ahead so set the Sydney Opera House clock to PM
The light above the San Francisco clock should turn red
Repeat this operation for the other two appointments in Paris and Sydney Paris appt
PM San Fran AM hours behind Sydney PM hours ahead Sydney appt
AM San Fran PM hours behind Paris AM hours behind The safe should now open revealing a photograph of Carl Linsky with an unknown man
Who can we get to identify this person
Why not Sylvia
Head over to Carl's apartment and listen to her hangover slurred apology for slobbering over you the night before
Ask Sylvia about all of the topics on your list she will identify the man in the photo as John Klaus Carl's old friend
Now let's try tackling that Bosworth Clark lead
Sonny Fletcher might know something about the guy since his name was likely on that list he was investigating
Go over to Sonny's hotel he's not around but he's left a note for you
Looks like he was looking for Bosworth Clark at an Anasazi ruin near Tucson
This is a good place to pick up the trail
Open up the location panel and speed off to Anasazi land
Brick by Brick Here we are at the ruin is Sonny waiting for us or perhaps Sonny's nemesis Slade
What are we looking for here
Your best bet is to proceed off to the right towards the two blue doors and go through the further one the closer one is locked
One you are through the door head straight for the leafless tree visible off in the distance straight ahead
Once you get to the tree pick up and examine the guidebook on the ground
Read about the bricks that when placed correctly will reveal a quot deep secret quot
Time to collect your bricks
The first brick is located quite close by turn around and look behind the staircase leading up to the ceremonial chamber
The first brick is located just to the right of the base of the stairs
Proceed up the stairs and enter the chamber itself
Along the wall to your right you will see another brick in a small recess unfortunately a snake is currently guarding it and you'll have to return later
Go and grab the small pile of sticks on the far side of the room and be sure to grab the rope hanging off the wall in one of the corners opposite the snake
Go back out climb down the stairs and proceed back towards your starting point at the ruin
As you advance you will see a quot No Trespassing quot sign to your right another brick lies on the ground to the left of the sign
Keep heading towards the blue doorway that you originally came through a set of long wooden poles and a wooden box should come into view to the right of the door the box is in a small alcove off to the right
Go over and pick up the poles and the box
Proceed to the next small alcove to the right of the wooden box there's another brick in here that makes
Leaving the alcove veer off to the left you should see another blue door here
Open it up and go in a wooden smoking pipe is located to your right just after entering the room
Follow the passageway around to the left and pick up the clay pot visible on the ground here surprise another brick
Keep going along this hallway through the s shaped turn and around another big bend to the left
A vine attached to a stick will be lying on the ground in the middle of the hallway
Before returning outside sneak a peak into the room ahead the x board where you'll be placing your bricks is located in here
Retrace your steps back outside and go back to the ceremonial chamber its time to deal with that snake
Combine the vine and stick with the wooden box to make a makeshift trap and then add the toy mouse from your office as bait
Grab this contraption and click on the snake
After the snake is captured grab the brick and head back towards your original starting point
Back by the entrance to the ruins you may have noticed a large well off to the left
Go over to the well get real close to the edge and look down to see another brick
To get the brick out combine the rope with the smoking pipe and use it to retrieve the brick
Next head towards the staircase behind you go up the steps and through the blue door
Another brick will be lying on the ground behind two pots in this room
Go back outside head down the stairs and turn left towards the painted cogs on the wall
Click here to initiate another puzzle
The object here is to match up the three red dots on the wall with the three red dots on the three cogs
The levers above the cogs turn each cog directly below one full turn unfortunately the other two cogs turn different distances When Cog rotates one turn Cog rotates turns and Cog rotates turns When Cog rotates one turn Cog rotates turns and Cog rotates turns When Cog rotates one turn Cog rotates turns and Cog rotates turns
Confused yet
Tired of this puzzle
From the beginning of the puzzle pull Lever down times followed by Lever up times and the dots will all align
A panel on the wall opens and the last brick is yours for the taking
Now that all of the bricks have been collected head back to the x board to place your bricks
The guidebook mentions that the bricks must be placed on the grid so that no two bricks lie in the same horizontal vertical or diagonal line
Bricks also cannot be placed on the two main diagonals of the x board
A solution to this puzzle is shown below dots represent bricks Once you've placed the bricks in the correct locations the doors at the top of the stairs to your left open up
Proceed through the doors down the hallway and into a room where you will find a pile of leather strips on the floor to your right
Pick them up and continue straight ahead by going up the stairs
This will trigger a cut scene with Tex checking out a gap ahead that is too wide to jump
After the scene has played combine the short sticks from the ceremonial chamber with the long poles and the leather straps to make a ladder
Grab the ladder and click on the gap to watch an entertaining clip of Tex trying to negotiate the gap
Once quot safely quot to the other side survey the room beyond
There's no slab in this lab Just to the left of the locked metal doors ahead of you there is a pair of eyeglasses on the floor
Pick up and examine the glasses to retrieve the electrical tape from the nerd goggles
Turning to your left past the alternative entrance to the room which can be opened you will find a pocket watch on the floor near the corner
Pick up and examine the watch to extract a spring
Continue turning to your left past the debris from your quot entrance quot to the next corner where a dime can be found on the floor
Pick up the dime and use it to open the metal panel to the right of the locked doors
The broken wire here can easily be fixed by first applying the spring to connect the wires and then the electrical tape to seal the deal
The doors open to real Bosworth Clark's secret lab hey wasn't he on Charlie's Angels
Hmmm hellip blood on the floor that can't be good
Have a look at Bosworth's equipment particularly the strange colour and tone coded entry system on his computer
You can turn on the overhead monitors by clicking the small white panel on the front of the centre computer console the big radar screen looking things
Wander over to his living quarters and pick up the ashtray on the table
Examining it reveals a burnt matchbook
There's a pass card reader located in the shelf to the right of the table
Also look under Bosworth's bed pick up and examine his videodisk player
Where can we find a videodisk to play
Go back over to the entrance and examine the chair by the door Tex thinks it's in a strange place
Could it have been used as a stepladder
Look up on the wall and grab the smoke alarm here
Examining it reveals that the smoke alarm is actually a camera with a videodisk inside told ya
Combine the disk and the player and examine it to watch a movie of Bosworth's final moments the database fax said he had kids hellip sadL
That must be the Evil Big Jim Slade doing the Russian Roulette thing
Did you notice the tone password that Bosworth inputted into his computer just before Slade came in
Watch the movie several times and try to repeat the password into the computer entry system
For those of you having trouble the correct sequence is red yellow blue white red yellow green
A shelf opens up revealing a pass card
But we'll need a password too
You will find it on the side of the left console on the other side of Bosworth's empty chair held to the wall by a magnet
The note tells us the password is TCAHCMEKE
Can you think of a chess term that those letters will re arrange to form
How about CHECKMATE
Attach the pass card reader to the computer scan the pass card and input the password
You'll learn a few details about the secret project and see a visual of a satellite spinning in space
Where do we go from here
Well we haven't seen Wanda Peck for a while maybe she knows something about STG and the man in the photo with Carl John Klaus
Go see Wanda she seems very interested in the photo in fact she wants to keep it and she sure doesn't like Klaus
Schimming with Sharks Now might be a good time to go back to the office and check the database for some background information
Once you are finished proceed back to C A P R I C O R N
to check on Wanda's progress with the photo
The only thing she has learned is that both men in the photo were wearing STG badges just like what's printed on those pass cards
She also mentions a letter from Poison Pawn and a contact name Jorge Valdez
Once again go back to the office to check the database for these new subjects
Turns out STG is a company or was owned by Gideon Enterprises
Now who would know about STG's parent company
Errr hellip Wanda
That's right go back to C A P R I C O R N
once more and speak to Wanda the conversation path here doesn't matter about Gideon and all of the resulting topics including J Saint Gideon and Frank Schimming
It's back again to the office we go except now there is a fax waiting for us with surprise Frank Schimming's direct phone number
Dial the number and speak to Frank he may hang up on you if you say the wrong thing i e
looking for hot tips saying you are a cop but if he does hang up just call him back again and all will be well
It helps if you are able to mention anything about C A P R I C O R N
and or Wanda Peck
Be sure to ask about everything during questioning Frank doesn't know much but he gives you J Saint Gideon's address
After the conversation is over proceed to Gideon's mansion for a lengthy movie in which Gideon talks about himself and his company
After the movie you get a chance to ask him some questions
He knows Jorge Valdez and after the interrogation is over you can head over to Valdez's rank and File Chess Shop
Again don't be too concerned about the conversation path with Valdez all paths lead to the questioning but mention Gideon to get some immediate co operation
Valdez doesn't actually know very much for instance he has no idea who the Poison Pawn is
After you are done go back to your office
That's your phone that is ringing
Click on the vidphone and receive a good lead about Val Davis from a strange looking mutant man
The game takes you directly to Davis' lab after the phone call
Goin' Ape Ah another lead another lab
Begin by checking out the computer and the microscope guess you'll need another pass card and reader
Grab and examine the note on the counter beside the microscope it simply says quot NEQUE quot
Could this be a scrambled password
Next go over to the area surrounding the examination table
Have a look in the cabinet marked quot Ape Toys quot there's a toy mouse in here just like the one you had before
Grab it
You can also look at some of the items on the counter here but there's not much of interest
None of the other cabinets or drawers open
On your way across the room to the animal cages swing by the big metal doors marked by a radiation symbol but don't go in yet
There will be a big pole resting up against the wall to the right of the doors
Grab it and proceed over to the big ape's cage
He's awake and guarding a metal box
Try using the pole to get the box no not gonna work
What do we have that the ape might want
The bananas of course
But how can we get the ape out of the way
Try combining the sleeping pills with the bananas and give one to the ape
Perfect he falls fast asleep
You'll grab the box with the pole and retrieve a pass card from the box
Be sure to check out the strange looking cats on the second floor before going on
Time to check out those radiation doors
Note save your game now timed sequence ahead
Open the doors and proceed in
Suddenly the doors close behind you and a big radiation thingie comes out of the ground
Sirens a' wailin' and a voice warns of radiation exposure that begins to rise
You must act quickly
Head off to the right and turn around to face the wall
Don't bother clicking on the button to open the door from the inside someone has tampered with the circuits for the override
Grab your circuit repair kit from your inventory and click on the black panel on the wall
The object of this next puzzle is to re connect any two wires the white lines crossing the circuit board one horizontally and one vertically
To do this use the four kit pieces over to the right
Look for wires that are already almost connected across the board
Meanwhile the radiation levels are getting higher and higher
Remember though you can't die after all you're telling the story here so you must have survived
If the radiation levels get too high we switch back to Tex telling Chelsee that he did not die he just did the puzzle a different way
The game then lets you load up your last saved game to try again
The puzzle is built on a by grid if the pieces are placed in the following way the wires will be re connected Remember that you can rotate each circuit piece by clicking and holding the left mouse button down on the piece while pressing either the left or right arrow keys on the keyboard
Congratulations you've saved your life
Take this opportunity to go look at the creepy experimental chair and be sure to pick up the pass card reader on the floor beyond the chair
Proceed back into the main room set up the pass card reader on the computer and scan the pass card
Have you unscrambled that password yet
How about quot QUEEN quot
Put the password in and see the quot microscopic quot view of the pass card that's a pretty low power machine
The symbols Qxd represent the shorthand of a chess move essentially Queen moves to space d and quot takes quot denoted by the x another chess piece
Check out the other two pass cards in your possession Card G has Rxe printed on it and Card E has Rd on it
Interesting
Time to head back to the office
Once back at your office check the floor by the front door there's a message waiting for you from Sonny Fletcher who apparently has some info for us on Big Jim Slade
Proceed over to Sonny's hotel where Sonny has a pass card for us but has been mortally wounded by Slade
Have a drink for Sonny as he passes on so that's when Tex started drinking
Tex finds Slade's lodge location remember the burnt matchbook from Clark's lab
and you should proceed there next
Run Runaway The visit to Jim Slade's room at the Big Surf Lodge is a tricky one since he's actually there
You obviously want to avoid him so remember two rules choose good hiding spots and put everything back the way you found it
Start by retrieving the key to Slade's sliding glass doors by combining the magnet with your tape measure
Now look through the window into the kitchen a key should be barely visible on the countertop on the right side
Use your magnetized tape measure to grab the key and use the key to open the door
Remember to shut it behind you after you go inside
Go over to the bed and examine the briefcase handcuffed here
We'll need a key for this
Go back over to the table immediately left of the sliding doors and pick up and examine Slade's wallet
We find two items of interest a lottery ticket and a piece of paper with a scrambled password on it
Remember to put the wallet back on the table where you found it
Skip the closet over on the right side for now we'll be using this as a hiding spot later
Go through the door into the living room kitchen and turn left into the living room
There appears to be something behind the right hand cushion on the sofa
Move the cushion and pick up some sort of word puzzle grid save it for later
Remember to put the cushion back the way you found it
In the kitchen go to the set of drawers along the same wall as the fridge and open the second drawer from the top you will find a bible here that will be useful later
Now approach the set of drawers next to the door into the bedroom there is a small bottle of chloral hydrate in the second drawer from the top
Remember to shut both drawers and any of the other cabinets that you open in the kitchen
Unfortunately there are no bananas in the fridge
Proceed back into the bedroom and open up the closet
Turn around and close the doors behind you
Now pick up Slade's clothes since this is the last item to look at this will trigger Slade's quot old fashioned quot cell phone to start ringing
Just sit tight for a minute if you've remembered to cover your tracks you can listen to Slade's conversation if not Slade comes out and shoots you and you'll have to load up a previously saved game
Once Slade has gone into the kitchen examine his clothes and retrieve a mailbox key from his pocket
Remember to put Slade's clothes back before leaving the closet
Proceed to the bathroom open the door and go inside
Have a look in the mirror open up the shower curtains by clicking on them and then turn around and pick up Slade's jacket hanging on the back of the door
Examine the jacket there's a handcuff key in the pocket
and put the jacket back on the door
Ooops hellip here comes Slade for his jacket
Quickly get into the shower close the curtains behind you and duck down as low as you can get
Slade will come in and pick up his jacket
Once he leaves get out of the shower and go back into the bedroom
Use the handcuff key on the briefcase to liberate it and immediately travel back to your office via the location panel
Whew
Going Postal Back in your office examine Slade's briefcase
We need some sort of combination for the lock
Did we get anything from Slade that indicates a numerical lock combination
How about the lottery ticket number
Dial in the number into the lock in groups of threes first quot and quot the green light will flash a couple of times second quot and quot and third quot and quot
The case magically opens to reveal two items a grid object and a piece of paper with some sort of word puzzle on it
The paper with the word puzzle has some bible notations on it try combining it with the J Saint Gideon's Bible we retrieved from Slade's kitchen
Click on the combined object to start a puzzle
Each of the lines containing a blank space has a bible book chapter verse and word code on it for example the first one reads Book of Job Chapter Verse Word
The appropriate verse is displayed at the bottom of the note so counting words along we get quot POST quot
Type in the word and click on the next bible book label on the list
You should end up with the five blank spaces reading quot POST OFFICE BOX NUMBER quot
But where is this post office
To use the grid combine it with the word scramble puzzle that we found in Slade's couch and click on the combined object to start a second puzzle
The object here is to place the grid on the rows and column of letters so that ten hit list names show up in the quot holes quot of the grid plus the green numbers through
Begin by grabbing the grid and placing it so that the green number quot quot is visible in the hole closest to the upper left corner of the grid the is located near the upper left corner of the letter puzzle
The rest of the letters form the name quot Rona Morgan quot and it appears as the first number on your list
Now move the grid so that the green quot quot shows up in the hole closest to the bottom right corner of the grid the is located about half way down on the right side of the letter puzzle
Val Davis' name now shows up on your list
Follow the rest of these steps Once completed a hit list is placed in your inventory
Those red letters that were present on the grid you may have noticed that one red letter showed up in each scrambled name spell out MILL VALLEY
Open your location panel and proceed to the Mill Valley Post Office but not before quot taking care quot of Sylvia
I Fought the Law After Tex retrieves a Law and Order Access Badge and Slade's coded orders from the post office box he goes directly to the Law and Order Party Headquarters
After entering he comes face to face with Harry Rice the night security guard
The conversation paths all lead to Harry taking the badge away to check it out leaving you free to roam in the lobby for a short period
Immediately go over to the coffee pot on the table to your right get up close grab the mickey from your inventory and click on the pot
Tex makes a bumbling attempt at spiking Harry's coffee and only barely gets away with it
Once Harry goes back to check on the badge ID again immediately go off to the right from the front desk down a short hallway and into the first door you see on the left the men's room
From there you'll see the guard drink his coffee and collapse
Now its time to look around the men's room
Open up Locker Number and grab the Law and Order Party Credo
This looks like it may be the decoding document for Slade's orders
Combine the credo with the coded orders and examine the two documents
In order to get each letter in the coded order simply count the number of letters from the start of the credo not including the title according to the number underneath each space
The final message will read quot MR SLADE PRIORITY TARGET ROBERT KNOTT HIS OFFICE PASSWORD PIRANHA quot
Before you go to Knott's office open up Locker and grab and examine the Law and Order brochure located here
Also try to open Locker looks like its locked
Proceed out the men's room door
Don't bother with any of the other doors on this side of the office they're all locked
As you pass the sleeping guard grab his keys lying in front of him on the floor
Go past the desk into the other side of the office turn to your left and pick up your Law and Order ID badge on the small table here
Use the keys from the guard to open up Knott's office which is located opposite the table
Once inside Knott's alarm is ringing turn around click on the wall unit located immediately to the right of the door type in quot PIRANHA quot and then hit ENTER to shut off the alarm
This is a pretty nice office
Move the chair located closest to the painting of the finch and pick up the small key lying on the floor Locker anyone
Come around Knott's desk and grab the Post it note on the seat of his chair a mysterious address to check on later
Knott's left desk drawer also has some interesting information indicating he was using Wanda Peck to check out John Klaus
Notice that Knott's phone can be dialled more on that later
Examine the ugly lizard painting on Knott's wall it can be moved to reveal a safe with a numeric keypad entry
One last thing there is a photograph on one of the shelves behind Knott's desk chair near the centre of the room and about halfway up the wall
It's a picture of hellip Sylvia and Frank Schimming
Whaaaa
Proceed back to the men's room and open Locker with the key from Knott's office
Inside you'll find an index card with a strange set of letters and numbers on it
But is it really that strange
What do the letters spell out backwards
quot MY TELEPHONE quot
Go back to Knott's office and input the numbers into the phone but in the reverse order than what is written on the page read them right to left
A message on the phone should read quot EMASES NEPO quot which of course backwards reads quot OPEN SESAME quot
Is this the code for the safe
Not completely since we can only enter numbers into the keypad on the safe
Look at the phone keypad and pick out the numbers that are represented by OPEN SESAME
Enter this number into the safe keypad press enter and retrieve a CD in the safe
You can now leave party headquarters but you will have to go back out into the lobby and use your ID badge on the front door to get out for some reason you can get extra points for trying the door without the pass card first
Proceed to the quot mysterious quot address and watch Tex walk into an obvious trap
Someone plays drums with his head and he is injected with some strange looking caulking gun
Do you think he will have MONO later
heh heh
Tex explains to Chelsee that he felt terrible afterwards but manages to get Wanda Peck to agree to meet him that night
Tex gives her the CD from Knott's office and gets the address of Knott's secret cabin gee how did Wanda know this
Hmmm hellip
Time to check out Knott's cabin for some answers
Tangled Knott Ah a nice peaceful cabin in the woods
Turn to the right and have a peek at the aquarium is that a metal box inside
Try grabbing the box out of the tank Youch
That's where Knott got his office password from
Move the horse picture above the tank and grab the bent nail sticking out of the wall
Now turn back to the front door and open up the skylight by clicking and turning on the switch
Walk over to the fireplace and pick up the log lying in front of the hearth
Next proceed over to the kitchen and look in the large sized cabinets across from the stove
You should find a coil of rope hanging on the right hand side of the right cabinet
Look under the counter you will find both a monkey wrench and one of those barbeque lighting mini torches in two different spots
There's also a water purification hose attached to the tap on the kitchen sink use the monkey wrench to unhook the metal hose
Your next move is into the bedroom where you'll find a hellip ahem hellip blow up doll under the bed
Tex takes this opportunity to blow her up
Proceed back to the living room and go to the aquarium
Combine the bent nail and the metal hose to form a crude fishing tool
Use it to fish out the metal box from the fish tank
Examine the box inside you will find Knott's Level clearance ID badge for the Law and Order Party headquarters
Knott isn't around so time to leave
Head out the front door and go back to your office
But wait who's that waiting outside the door
Looks like Knott with a cross bow
Don't worry about the conversation just mention Wanda first chance you get and Knott will trust you
The cut scene with Knott reveals some important information but he is shot before you can question him
You end up back on the floor of the cabin with bullets pang pinging around
DO NOT GET UP IF YOU DO YOU WILL BE SHOT
Staying at floor level move over to Knott's body and get the key lying on the floor by his foot
Crawl over to the bedroom door open it and using the key open the closet
There's a jacket and hat outfit in here grab it and combine it with the blow up doll to make a decoy dummy
Take this opportunity to combine the rope with the fire log to make a quick anchor
Now crawl back out into the kitchen grab the dressed doll from your inventory and click anywhere in the direction of the living room
You'll see Tex using the doll to invite the boys in for a party
After they accept grab your makeshift anchor and click on the skylight
The shooters realize the decoy but you manage to climb up through the skylight and using the torch blow up the cabin good
Real good
The next portion of the story is told in movie form with Sylvia putting a full court press on Tex back at his office and some tender moments with Chelsee awww hellip
After taking Sylvia back to the luxurious warehouse the phone is ringing for you when you get back
Its our mysterious mutant friend with some advice to investigate the recently departed Greg Call
The police may know something so we are automatically taken to Eve Clement's office
Mention Slade The Hitman to her and she's ready to give you all the help you need
Apparently they found a mysterious chip in Call's head
The police can't make heads or tails of it so she gives it to you
Examine the chip once you are back at the office but do it quickly since we don't have the tools necessary to solve it yet
Exit the puzzle
Where can we find out information on Greg Call one of the lead researchers at STG
How about the STG office in Fresno remember mail is still being delivered there
Follow this rather dubious line of reasoning and proceed back to the Fresno office
By George
There's a courier package waiting for us by the door
Examine the package to reveal two items a Braille chart and a note
Combine the chart with the computer chip from Call's head and fill in the code word at the bottom you should get quot NEXUS quot
The other note mentions that we have been exposed to quot P quot and gives us the two ways that Greg Call uses to encode messages
We'll need to find out more about this quot NEXUS quot word
Who is the only one to really know Greg Call
Why J Saint Gideon his former employer
Proceed over to Gideon's mansion and catch him just before he leaves on an extended trip
He will be happy to answer any of your questions
Gideon relates that the location of NEXUS is in Washington State but doesn't think anything is there
But we know better
Proceed to Call's NEXUS lab
Call of the Wild The lab's scanner all but confirms that we've been outfitted with one of those brain bugs that is driving everyone to suicide
Once in the lab go directly to the examination table and grab the piece of paper from the clipboard hanging underneath
The sheet lists all of the different kinds of implants as well as the quot kamikaze quot implants that will neutralize the original ones
Since Tex has been tagged with a P implant a quot N quot kamikaze should do the trick
Be sure to grab the access card that is still attached to the clipboard it was underneath the paper before moving on
Move over to the smaller table behind the examination table and pick up the implant syringe
Nasty looking
Next proceed back to the entrance and turn on the switch immediately to the right of the door
The x ray examination light will come one
Isn't that the shadow of an object near the bottom of the light
Click on the light to remove the light cover and grad the pass card located inside the light fixture
Have a quick look at Call's computer and pick up examine the newspaper article about the death of Val Davis beside his keyboard
Call knew his time was up soon
Walk over to the other side of the room and pick up a pass card reader located to the left of the storage containers with the round doors
We'll need a password before we can access Call's computer files
Notice the card swipe next to the storage containers with the round doors
Grab the access card you found on the clipboard and click on the swipe to open the storage containers
Different numbered implants are stored in each container
Kamikaze implant N is located in the top right container
Next combine the Kamikaze implant with the syringe and examine the loaded syringe to carry out this gruesome deed
One question where's the blood
Before continuing you'll need to go over to the implant removal station past the examination table on the far wall and quot guide quot the Kamikaze implant to the bad P one inside your own head
When you turn on the station a maze of your brain's blood vessels appears
You first must choose which blood vessel to inject the implant into and then find the green diamond in the middle of your brain all the while avoiding the little antibodies trying to destroy the Kamikaze implant
A good place to start is a blood vessel near the power bar as shown in this diagram
Once you've injected the implant into the blood vessel point the little syringe at the end of the vessel and click the cursor turns into a small blue cross that can be moved around the veins
The following path will get you to the P implant
Note that most intersections are way junctions so invariably there is a quot left quot and a quot right quot fork to choose between although sometimes the configuration of the blood vessels makes it tough to distinguish between left and right
For the record all of my directions are taken from the perspective of the blue cross travelling within the vessels Left left middle this is a four way branch left right right and right
Once completed you hear someone coming turns out its our mysterious mutant friend Larry Hammond
Larry isn't nearly as helpful as he made out he would be but he does fill in some knowledge gaps and gives you his pass card and an envelope from Greg Call
Once Larry has departed examine Greg Call's quot In case I die hellip quot envelope on which Larry has written his pass card's password quot WARD quot rearranges to quot DRAW quot
The envelope contains a note detailing information about the chess moves available to combat the quot Stalemate quot program make sure you understand the chess notation but no need to study this too closely and a note addressed to Larry
The note contains a code indicating Greg's password
What did the courier message say about Greg's coding techniques
Try writing down every third word from the note starting from the name quot Larry quot
Comprehensible
Nope but try every fourth word you should get a message that reads quot If you can figure this out my password follows
In the first letters good am most brain in the quot
Huh
Well the message gives us words after the phrase quot In the first letters quot taking the fist letters of those last six words gives us quot GAMBIT quot our password
Proceed over to the computer install the pass card reader swipe Greg's pass card input the password and watch the taped message from Greg Call which pretty much lays out what's going on both Gideon and the Law and Order Party are fighting over a method for controlling people's minds
Call implores us to use the Stalemate program to stop the madness
Time to head back to California
Tex indicates that the Law and Order Party headquarters is the next destination
Rice to See You
Harry Stellar security guard Harry Rice is nowhere to be found in the Law and Order Party lobby so take this opportunity to go into the open door behind the main desk off to the right a bit
You are now in the Reception Hall but there's a security camera mounted on the wall between the two doors to the lobby
Go over to the wall of windows and pick up the music stand located just to the left of the windows you get a quick shot of Harry on the prowl
Examine the stand Tex extends the stem as far as it will go
Next combine the stand with the Law and Order brochure
Now take the brochure stand over to the security camera on the wall and click on the camera to use the photo in the brochure to cover your tracks
Be sure to stop by the side bar for some delicious Law and Order treats grab the chopsticks while you're at it and note that there is a phone to the left of the bar that is accessible
Approach the Law and Order tapestry hanging on the wall at the back of the room and move it aside to uncover a secret door
The pass card swipe doesn't seem to be working though
Use the chopsticks to poke the swipe bar out of the wall and use Knott's Level Law and Order pass card to gain entrance to John Klaus' secret lab
Note Klaus' lab seemed to have a few graphical and movement bugs in it so be sure to save before you go in
Klaus has been doing some nasty things in the little dingy room
Grab the paper on the floor by his desk apparently Officer Rice has to answer Extension whenever it rings
This may be helpful on the way out
Check out all of the pictures of mediaeval knights on the wall and peruse Klaus' list of movies to avoid recognize any common words
Could his password be KNIGHT
There's a photo on Klaus' desk uh oh Sylvia and Gideon hamming it up
Open up the first desk drawer and examine the Law and Order memo inside not actually that useful
Proceed over to the other side of the room and have a quick look at the implants list sitting beside the examination table if you can get close to it that is
Have a look at the printout in the corner Carl Linsky's name is displayed here
Was it here that the implant was inserted into Linsky
Play the tape recorder for some disturbing memories of Klaus' handiwork
Open the drawer found below those nasty surgical tools to reveal a small framed picture of a cat with the title quot LESCAT quot
Examine the picture and then examine the pieces of the cat itself which are actually the pieces of a cut up pass card like the one from Linsky's warehouse
The pieces fit like this Now how can we arrange LESCAT to get a chess term
How about CASTLE
Since we're finished in the lab go back out into the reception hall
Pick up the phone and dial Extension since Harry has to go answer it you can make a break for it
Go back out into the lobby I'd use the right door I had trouble going through the left one and use the Level Law and Order pass card to get out
Go back to your office there should be two phone messages for you from Jorge Valdez who has received a message from Poison Pawn for you at his store and Wanda Peck who invites you to dinner hellip um I mean thanks you for the CD you dropped off before going to Knott's cabin
Time to go see Valdez at the Rank and File Chess Shop
Valdez has an e mail for you on his computer from Poison Pawn instructing you to come to the San Tomas Mission at midnight
Off you go
San Tomas Mission Impossible After arriving at the Mission you end up downstairs below the tower which is accessible via a freight elevator
But its not working hellip yet
First turn back towards the door and look around until you see a broom leaning up against the wall its located to the right of the door
Do you see the rock in front of the bristles of the broom
Pick up the rock you'll need it for later
Now turn to your left until the red tool box on a shelf to the left of the door comes into view
Open the tool box and pick up the penknife you'll need this too
Now its time to get that elevator working
Starting at the elevator turn to your right until a set of shelves comes into view
Do you see the set of three non descript boxes sitting on the second shelf from the floor
Click on these boxes and move them aside to reveal an electrical panel
Open the panel and switch on the elevator power switch
Now proceed back to the elevator and press the button to the left of the door
The next movie shows Tex travelling up the tower in the elevator and stepping out to meet the Poison Pawn
The sight of Sylvia tied to a chair with blood on her face is a sure sign that we've run into trouble
Watch the entire exchange between John Klaus and Tex and later with Jim Slade
We enter an interactive conversation with Slade after he's broken Klaus' neck in an attempt to get the pass cards for himself
Save your game before starting the conversation this is the one conversation where the choices you make determine whether you live or die
This is a very difficult puzzle to get through unscathed be prepared to die at least a few times
If you choose a conversation path that gets you to another set of choices without dying save your game this way you don't have to keep replaying the entire conversation after starting over
Remember to use the items you collected on the floor below
The correct and only complete path through the conversation is as follows Make a last request Kiss Sylvia goodbye Slip her the penknife Challenge Slade Shut off the lights and hide Throw the rock Grab a shield and run to the landing Stall for time and Throw the pass cards into the clock
After you and Sylvia take care of Slade and she begs you for forgiveness proceed over to Gideon's mansion to find that Overlord computer
Maniac Mansion You are transported directly to Gideon's bedroom thank you Sylvia
The carpet here resembles a giant chessboard
Move into the centre of the room and grab the note on the checkered table
The paper describes the alarm in Gideon's gallery
We'll need this later to get through the gallery
Walk over to Gideon's bed and pick up the dumbbell bar lying on the floor to the right of the bed
Then go over to the left side of the bed and open up the box on the floor it's a piece chess set
Pick the pieces up and take them over to the chessboard table in the centre of the room
The object of this puzzle is to place the six pieces in their quot proper quot spots on the chess board
But how
Remember how we noted that the rug looked like a giant chessboard
Have a look at the statues atop the pillars about the room
Find the larger version of the six pieces on the rug and plot out their locations
The correct solution is shown below Kn Knight horse Kg King tall piece with cross on top P Pawn shortest piece B Bishop taller pawn Q Queen tall piece with crown R Rook castle tower After the puzzle is completed the large picture on the wall opposite the bed lifts to reveal an elevator
If you are trying to maximize points this is a good time to go over to Val Davis' lab to look at the chess moves on the rest of the cards
Come back to Gideon's bedroom when you are done
Enter the elevator and press the button to the right of the door
You will be taken to a balcony that overlooks Gideon's gallery
The object here is to get onto the retaining walls down below and travel along the tops of the walls until the alarm panel is found
Before we do this we've got to find something to get us over to the walls
Walk back towards the two staircases that run down towards the gallery and click on the long part of the central hand rail it should be loose enough to pull off
Do the same for the hand rail on the other staircase
Combine both rails with the dumbbell bar to form a long pole
Now go back to the balcony overlooking the gallery
Turn around to your right and see the small switch on the wall
Hit the switch to lower the chandelier and click on the chandelier with the pole
Tex will shimmy across the pole and land on the top of the nearest retaining wall
At this point the entire floor of the gallery is alarmed but the walls are not
Tex must now find the alarm panel to start the alarm sequence shown on the sheet in Gideon's bedroom
As you move along the wall be sure to look down at all times a fall will kill you
From where Tex is now standing go forward until the wall ends then turn right and go forward until the wall ends
Turn left and go forward until the wall ends
Turn to your left and go forward but turn towards a wall going off to your right at the first opportunity
Go about half way along this wall and stop
Looking down and turning to your right you should see the red and black alarm panel once you have turned almost degrees
Go ahead and open the panel
It's probably a good time to look at the alarm pattern sheet since once you turn the alarm on you will have to get off that wall almost immediately
If we assume that the top of the drawing is north we've travelled from the south end of the room to the northeastern corner
The inside portions of the gallery are safe for the first part of the floor alarm sequence so a good strategy will be to fall off the wall into the northeastern interior room immediately after switching on the system
Simply hit the switch and then fall backwards off the wall into the northeastern room
There are several ways of avoiding the alarmed portions of the floor areas that are armed are lit up while unarmed areas of the floor are not
Your ultimate goal is to make it to the door along the north side of the room
The following strategy will work The Longest Hallway Go through the door into one of Gideon's really long hallways
Isn't it a relief not to worry about the floor zapping you
Turn to the right and proceed down the hallway until you reach a bench located on your left side
Pick up the CD that is lying on the seat
Keep going straight ahead until you reach the door to Gideon's study and go in
Proceed straight ahead to Gideon's desk and look at his dinosaur coin holder
Try placing the dime you got back at Bosworth Clark's lab into the dinosaur out pops poops a key
Grab it and have a look around the room
Tex seems to think that the bookshelves may be hiding something
Go to the bookshelf in the back left corner of the room from the perspective of the doorway and click on the books that are located on the right side of the top shelf
Open up the secret compartment and take the ornate cross
Now proceed over to the stained glass picture of the sword on the other side of the room
Grab the cross from inventory and click on the picture
You must now place the cross in one of the bronze coloured squares that surround the picture
The puzzle flashes the outline of a number of shapes on the squares every few moments and you are to find the specific spot the cross belongs in
The cross should be placed in the bottom left corner square with the top of the cross up against the top of the square and the left side of the cross up against the left side of the square
After the cross has been properly positioned a panel will open up to the right of the stained glass picture
Grab the blue pass card in the compartment and go back outside to the hallway
Go forward and take the hallway going off to the left
Follow this around until you reach a door and using the key from the dinosaur unlock the door and go in
This is Gideon's games room
Go over to the pool table and look at some of the balls
The solid ones in all can be picked up
Examine the balls and note the numbers and corresponding colours for later
You can try Gideon's Mean Streets video game in the back corner of the room
This resembles the original Tex game back in the 's
If you have the patience play for a while you'll get some points out of it
Otherwise forget the game and head over to the other side of the room
Have a look at the side tables next to Gideon's fire side sofa there is a mixed up puzzle for you to try
Pick up the puzzle and examine it
This is to be solved like any other jigsaw puzzle find the edge pieces the dark blue ones are water and belong along the bottom and the light blue ones are sky belonging along the top
Rearrange the pieces to form a picture of hellip Alcatraz
The puzzle flips over and gives you the passwords for the pass cards you've been collecting
Proceed back to the hallway and retrace your steps back to your starting point at the door to the gallery follow the hallway until it ends and then turn left or use the location panel to go there directly
Now travel in the direction away from the study and follow this hallway until it ends at another set of locked doors
Approach the security panel to the left of the door and click on it
This panel requires that a number be entered for each of the colours displayed which just happen to correspond to the eight pool balls you've collected
Go ahead and enter a number for each colour press the colour button and then enter the number red green black orange burgundy blue purple and yellow
The doors will now be unlocked allowing you access to Gideon's control room
Gideon has all kinds of surveillance equipment cameras and other doo dads in here
The only one you're interested in is the computer on the right
Grab that CD from inventory and click on the CD drive thin grey strip between the monitor and the computer
The information on this CD details robot security at the Alcatraz installation you may want to jot this down for later
Cell Blocks B D and the lower levels are safe while there are robots patrolling Blocks A and C Now grab another CD sitting on top of the computer's monitor and pop it into the drive
We get some additional background information on Gideon's secret Alcatraz lair
Before going back grab your blue pass card from the study and press the alarm panel immediately right of the doorway
This will turn off all alarms in the gallery
Now open your location panel and transport back to the gallery or get there via the hallways
Cross the gallery and go up one of the staircases to the elevator
Once inside you are taken directly to Tex's office where a newly insurance rich Sylvia gets testy when you announce your planned trip to Alcatraz to stop Gideon
After she storms out you are taken automatically to Alcatraz where a robot immediately zaps you and you wake up in a jail cell
Escape Into Alcatraz Begin by moving one of the two bunk beds aside to reveal a portion of the wall that has decayed to show some of the brickwork underneath
Click to access a puzzle where the object is to open up a square shaped hole for Tex to crawl through
You can take bricks out as long as the bricks above are supported but you must put all of the bricks back somewhere
You can turn them sideways press down with your left mouse button and hit the left or right key or put them on top of other bricks as long as you don't cover up the lines between the bricks
You've made it into the next cell
Turn around and pick up the one brick left over from the excavation
Now grab the chain and hook from the bed hanging off the wall on the opposite wall
Proceed up to the cell bars and look to the left
You should see a shelf outside the cell with some items on it
Throw the brick at the shelf by grabbing the brick and clicking on the shelf
After the items have fallen onto the tarp on the floor use the chain and hook to drag the tarp over to the cell
You can now pick up the two items a roll of electrical tape and a small torch
Use the torch on the bars to cut yourself a hole in the door to get out of your cell
Once out immediately head into the open cell located directly to your left
Remember that none of the robots can zap you while you are inside a cell
This is a good place to get your bearings find out where the robot is and pick up a roll of barbed wire hanging from the wall here
Be sure to examine the wire in order to roll it out for future use
The robot on Block A is not too evil it won't zap you unless you are very close to it
Head out of the cell and go left
Make a right turn when the corridor ends and proceed over to a set of doors on the right side
This is the door to Block B
You should see a patch of white beyond the locked gate
Grab the barbed wire and click on the patch to retrieve a key
The key can then be used to open up the door into Block B
You can relax for a bit in Block B no robots
Proceed over to the doorway into the visitation area and open the unlocked door
You should see an overturned chair immediately to your left as you enter the room
Move this chair and pick up the old gas mask sitting on the floor
Continue through the room have a quick look at one of the visitation booths and open the next unlocked door
Head off to the right and using the key again open the doors that lead to the infirmary
There will be a pass card on the floor of this little room
Pick it up and proceed over to the doors on the other side of the room the way into Block C The robot in Block C is more difficult to navigate around since it can zap you from above and from a farther distance away than the robot in Block A
Your destination in this cell block is the third open cell on the left hand side
Proceed along the hallway making a bee line for the first open cell on the left hand side
Make your way down the hallway one open cell at a time you can save your game within each cell and use the sound of the robot to determine whether it is safe to proceed to the next cell
The key for the door to Block D is hanging on the back wall of the third open cell on the left side
After getting the key you must make your way back up the corridor to your starting point
Turn left where the corridor ends you should see the grey doorway leading to Block D straight ahead
Use the key to unlock the door and enter
Block D no robots
contains a series of ten locked cells and a stairway leading underground
Quickly scan the interior of the ten cells there are some interesting looking items in the seventh cell from the Block D entrance
Go back to the Block D entrance and open the security panel located immediately to the right of the door
The lever on the right side opens the doors to the cells and the two equations on the left describe how the position of the lever relates to which cell door will open
Solving the two equations e o and o e yields values for e and o
What does this mean
Well if you put the lever to an even number the actual cell door number that will open will be less
Example Position will open Cell door
An odd position for the lever will open the cell door number that is more
Examples Position will open Cell door Position will open Cell door once you get to go back to and keep counting
Using all of this high school math we can determine that Position will open Cell door
Or you can simply try all of the positions until cell door opens
Once inside Cell open up the small box on the floor in the back of the cell and take out the explosives inside
Next proceed down the stairs and enter the underground area
Searching for J Saint Fisher There is a large metal door located immediately to your right after you enter the underground area
Open this door and grab the new looking garbage bag located front and centre
Examine the bag and take out a dirty air filter
Go back out into the hallway and moving forward take your next right
Proceed to the end of this deserted hallway and open the door at the end
Inside is a derelict maintenance robot
Pick up the filter removal tool lying on the floor next to the robot
Proceed back along the corridor and go to the right
When you get to the first of the high powered fans operating up ahead click on the control panel to watch a maintenance robot come out and change the dirty air filter
After the robot departs make your way down this last hallway to the storage crates piled near the hallway's end
Click on the first crate you come to it can be moved to access the area behind
Make your way behind the crates and check out the live security guard stationed behind the glass enclosure
Proceed to the back corner and pick up the screwdriver located on top of the last crate against the wall
To complete our entry strategy we will need some gas to take out the security guard
To do this we'll need to get past the robot in Block C again we needed the screwdriver first
Open up the location panel and go back to Block C As before carefully make your way up the corridor running from cell to cell this time you want to make it all the way to the end of the hallway
Once there press yourself right up against the wall the robot cannot detect you here
Look up and find the gas canister hanging from the wall and unscrew it with the screwdriver
Now navigate by the robot one more time and go back through Bock D to the underground area
Go up to the fan located closest to the guard's enclosure and use the robot tool to open up the air filter panel
Next construct your super duper gas bomb by combining the explosives with the gas canister then adding the electrical tape and finally the used air filter
Make sure you have the gas mask in your inventory although you don't have to do anything with it
Now take your bomb and click on the clean filter currently in place
The robot comes out and takes your spiked filter back into the security area
The gas bomb takes out both the robot and the security guard
Go ahead and enter the security area now
Step behind the guard's desk and pick up Gideon's hairbrush that he conveniently forgot here
Examine the brush to remove some of Gideon's hair for later
Next use the pass card from Block B on the wall panel to the left of the glass doors to gain entry
Proceed up the hallway and place Gideon's hair on the DNA scanner to gain entry to the inner sanctum
Tex walks into a darkened area and finds a computer terminal demanding the pass cards and their corresponding passwords
This puzzle requires you to insert each of the pass cards into the slot located over on the right side of the screen use the arrow keys to turn the cards so they will fit in the hole
If you forget the passwords are A queen B draw C castle D gambit E bishop F resign G checkmate H knight
You will be taken into the Stalemate program where you must face off against Gideon in an already underway chess match with only the moves from Greg Call's note to choose from
You must checkmate Gideon in six moves
The trick is to be aggressive go after his king in the second move or he will checkmate you with his queen
The sequence of moves is Rd Rxe Qxe Bf Bd and Pxe
Gideon is gracious in defeat and takes the only way out
Tex lives happily every after with Sylvia for about minutes and Tex and Chelsee get serious about their relationship only to be kidnapped at the end by a dastardly Australian
