Sacred GroundHints and Walkthroughby Bytten th April Introduction Sacred Ground is a very irritating game
Firstly there are lengthy video sequences that you need to go through
They are very good but you tire of seeing them over and over again which is what you need to do to finish this game
The game is strictly time limited and you don't have a lot of time to get everything right
Once you have run out of time the only solution is to restore the game to a previous point and try another path
This VERY quickly becomes quite tedious
Game Hints
You don't need to take photographs to finish the game
They only waste time
You don't need to visit the Library to finish the game
You don't need to visit the Mongoose Tavern to finish the game
You don't need to interview Wally to finish the game
Try to interview people right at the end of the day
This way you can cheat the timer
To arrest someone later in the game you must have two alibis that don't add up for that particular person so you DO need to order alibi checks on all suspects
Walkthrough Watch the opening video sequence describing the kidnapping
Day One
To start off with the only place you can go is the police station
Go there and you will be given your assignment by Chief Weber
You will also be introduced to Detective John Night Sky who will be interviewing the witnesses initially
Finally your PDA will be discussed

When you return to the map of Santa Fe your PDA is ringing so answer it
You will meet Detective Rebecca Orlando who will help with researching alibis

When you once again return to the Santa Fe map you are only able to go to the Tasker Estate so go there

Visit the Tasker Estate and go into Martin's office
Examine the drawer Theresa's letter the receipt in the top half of the briefcase the unmailed letter in the bottom half of the briefcase the letter to the lawyers on the front of the desk the answering machine and the prenuptial agreement in the desk file at the top right of the desk

Visit Dan Lightfoot and interview him

His alibi is unprovable

Visit George Vesco and interview him
His alibi is unprovable
You will also receive the forensic report on the rope loop

The only remaining bit of evidence which hasn't been reported on yet is the glove which doesn't matter

Head back to Police Headquarters and issue an arrest warrant for there are four possibilities

The Keepers clan knows that to combine the Sacred Rings with the Tetrahedron will grant the holder unlimited power and immortality
Durad wanted to acquire the Sacred Rings and with the help of Gugon instigated a Keepers rebellion using Gugon's power to control men
Arakon acquired the aid of Umang to collect the Sacred Rings and the Tetrahedron of Dragast and Na Tiexu
Umang traveled the worlds of Ademika Dragast and Na Tiexu to collect the artifacts
Bargul the leader of the Shadow Legion watches the arrival of Umang to this world
He praises his magician Gugon in the use of Durad He orders his guards to find this Umang and throws the amulet to guide them
Bargul's ultimate plan is to invade the new world of the Keepers
The last time we saw Umang was when he was being chased at the Island of Unity by the rival clan led by Durad
Unbeknownst to Umang an amulet was added to his inventory by a thief he released from prison at the Temple at Dragast Umang goes through the latest gate found by the Clan Leaders
The Sacred Rings must be returned to the Keepers the only ones who will be able to watch over them

Questions regarding this walkthrough may be addressed to Witchen at gjan aol com The Prologue The mystical Keepers Clan has known since the beginning of time that the tetrahendrons together with the Sacred Rings bring powerful and mystical forces together
Evil Durad leader of a rival clan is defiantly opposed to the Keepers benevolent plan to use the power of the precious artifacts to maintain unlimited power and immortality in a peaceful world Durad wants the rings and the tetrahedrons for himself To this end Durad calls upon Gugon an evil sorcerer in his employ Gugon is powerful in his own right and can control the souls of hapless men who fall under his influence
In following Durad's orders Gugon instigates a rebellion incorporating the Shadow Legion in the effort
The Shadow Legion is led by Bargul
Under the overall direction of Durad the Shadow Legion is ordered to find and steal the sacred artifacts
Arakon the leader of the Keepers Clan hears of the rebellion and knowing Durad's intent he calls upon his top student Umang to find and safeguard the two tetrahedron artifacts Umang journeys to the worlds of Ademiko Dragast and Na Tiexu to find the artifacts
On the Isle of Unity Umang is advised by another member of the Keepers Clan that the rebellion is strengthening and Gugan the sorcerer has discovered Umang's whereabouts there on the island Umang uses a portal to escape to another world where he believes he'll be able to hide until the rebellion is quelled Little does Umang know that his challenging and often life threatening adventure has barely begun
In the opening cutscene Bargul the leader of the Shadow Legion is shown spying on Umang in a magic orb Bargul plots with Gugon and tosses a member of the Shadow Legion a silver amulet to help guide the Legion to Umang Gugon now controls Durad's soul and he plots with Bargul to find the artifacts and depose Durad as the leader of the clan opposing the Keepers but time is running out
We see Umang enter the portal on his way to safety and in a fall from the portal and the very sky he is knocked unconscious Hearing a startling noise outside the occupant of a nearby metal structure Nikifor comes out to find Umang and brings him inside Nikifor thinks of the structure as his quot house quot After cursory introductions Nikifor wants Umang to open a big iron door and do various odd jobs needed around his house Having issued these instructions Nikifor goes off to his cabin to take a nap

Each mechanical device requires a different number of crystals to run
See a drawing of a crystal
They can be found Oh well we'll find them
Exit the desk and go forward to the door Before you go out turn left and go forward to the pedestal in the corner

V V Set the symbols at lower left to match those in your journal Now press the button opposite on your right
Click on that button to determine the symbol for each number of the crystals shown on the panel Note and remember that each is a different color
You can draw the symbols below on a print copy if you wish
However I found the colors were all that is necessary
crystal WHITE crystals DARK BLUE may appear black crystals YELLOW crystals LIGHT BLUE crystals GREEN crystals RED may appear purple With this new knowledge let's see what we can do with those four generator room keys Exit the den Go right and then left down the stairs Go right and around to the door
THE GENERATOR ROOM DOOR PUZZLE Insert the four keys left to right from your inventory in the slots of the lock Click each button below one time displaying the appropriate code in symbols
Umang will say quot Success quot when the door unlocks
If you fail just start over using exactly the same process
Open the door turn right and go down the stairs In front of you see a pedestal with various symbols These symbols and colors denote the numbers of crystals needed to power up various components of the vehicle as shown on the Security Box in the den
Pan left and go down the corridor to the silver object with lighted disks at the end It should remind you of a graphic from the desk in the den
Here it is the driving heart of the vehicle Umang exclaims that the object quot looks like an engine quot And indeed it is
Go forward and open the panel to see the engine's crystal compartment There are already two crystals installed in the top positions As you don't know yet quite what action to take here turn around and go back down the corridor
Nikifor appears and speaks with Umang his discovery of the engine and the need for batteries i e the crystals Continue down the corridor and enter The Compressor Room Turn to the right and take a look at the chart on the wall You might want to make a quick sketch Pan down and pick up theWRENCHfrom the work table
Swing slightly left and go forward to a close up of what looks like another crystal installed in some sort of peripheral device remember its position Turn left to see a huge compressor in the middle of the back wall See the control panel with three lever positions and only two levers one of them is broken Umang remarks that quot there must be something around here I can use to get this contraption going quot THE COMPRESSOR PUZZLE Use your wrench from inventory to replace the missing lever in the left position and using the wall chart as reference Move the wrench lever to the lowest position Move the next middle lever to the second from the bottom position
Move the third and last lever to the third from the bottom position
If you have successfully set the levers the compressor will begin to operate Well good We're making some progress
Now that some of the power appears to be working go to the pedestal to the right of the door
The large machine to the left of the compressor is not operable
At the pedestal move the lever upward to the third yellow position and see a still photo showing that the yellow symbol has been activated on a panel somewhere in this vehicle Enough with the pedestal
Move back twice and out out the door
Now turn right and see another pedestal
Let's see if we can activate another section of the vehicle When you click on the green fourth symbol you'll be shown a still shot of the green symbol being activated on the distant panel along with the yellow one from the pedestal in the compressor room Turn around go forward and go up the stairs
Turn left and exit through the door Go across to the main staircase Pass through the double doors
Go forward once past Nikifor's cabin and pan left to see another door with a familiar white symbol just above the frame Click on the door to find it locked Hmmm I'll bet you can figure out how to unlock it right Remember the Security Box in the den identifies a single crystal corresponding with this white symbol Where did you see crystals in place all ready to be powered up Down we go to the generator room and back to the engine
Turn around and go back downstairs through the double doors Turn right go through the generator room door down the stairs turn left and go to the engine At the engine open the panel Activate one crystal by pressing it Then press the WHITE button on the top left of the upper panel
Back out
Turn and go down the corridor right and then back up the stairs Go left at the top out through the door

Go forward and open the cabinet Take theCRYSTAL CAPSULEand anOIL CANfor quot lubricating machinery quot That's all you can do in the storeroom for now so exit through the door and go left through the second set of double doors Directly ahead of you is a single person elevator Use the controls at right on the wall to determine that the elevator is not working properly for some reason
The elevator platform will not descend Leave the elevator for now but keep it in mind
Go right one click and then left through the door to the right of the elevator controls
The Bridge Go down the steps to the upper platform housing the wheel the helm of the vehicle and other instruments necessary to power and operate it On the wheel pedestal note the control panel and symbols The controls are inoperable as yet Pan back and try to pull the lever on the floor at left quot I must have missed something quot is the response to your attempt We have a number of actions to complete yet Turn further left and click on the now familiar pedestal with the symbols for the power crystal requirements This is the third pedestal Come out of the close up Pan right to see the lighted indicator on the side wall reflecting your action to activate the first two pedestals in the below decks corridor and the compressor room Turn around Go forward and right to the side table Check it out to find it also is not yet operable Swing left Go forward to the tall center bookcase See that a book has fallen to the floor revealing a latch Click on the latch to hear quot Its locked quot Looks like we need to make another trip down to the engine
Pan left or right to go up a set of side stairs and turn around to exit to the upper stairs and the bridge In the corridor go through both sets of double doors down the stairs around to the right through the generator room door and down the stairs Go left to the engine
Open the panel light the second crystal and press the upper right DARK BLUE button on the top panel Remember in reasoning out this action that to open the latch in the bookcase on the bridge the color for two crystals is dark blue as depicted at the Security Box in the den So far you only have two of the required number of crystals to work with Exit the engine area and retrace your steps out of the engine room up the main staircase through both double doors and left or right past the elevator
Then through the side door to the bridge area Go down the stairs to the lower area in front of the bookcase
The Secret Room Press the latch and Umang enters a small circular secret room behind the bookcase Go forward to see the skeleton of perhaps the former captain of this strange vehicle Swing left and note the dark blue plaque on the wall with the appropriate symbol for two crystals
This discovery corroborates the action you already took at the engine to power up the second crystal unlocking the secret room Pan down left on the desk top and pick up theSPYGLASS Press the big brass button which was under the spyglass and watch a panel descend on a large piece of equipment across the room Go over there and look in close up at the six tubes inside Keep the location of this essential piece of equipment in mind
Exit the close up of the panel and pan down right Go forward
Pick up aTHIRD CRYSTALlaying on top of the small trunk Open the trunk and take the note inside
It bears a drawing look closely of the tubes inside the panel to your left

Stop at the little console on your right and open the front panel again Place the telescope key in the receptacle and watch a cutscene of the telescope being activated and positioned to view the outside landscape
Click on the eyepiece and watch the arrival of three members of the Shadow Legion
Oh gad This is definitely not good news In a cutscene Umang rushes to tell Nikifor about this perilous development The urgency to get this vehicle moving accelerates Nikifor goes outside to deny Umang's presence in the vehicle and to exchange banter with the soldiers The Shadow Legion soldiers decide to wait out the situation hoping to capture Umang quot You have to come out sooner or later quot Nikifor and Umang collaborate in the face of not having all the crystals necessary to get the vehicle moving Nikifor reasons that the Shadow Legion's vehicles must also operate with crystals Umang then suggests they wait until dark and try to go out and steal them
Stealing the Crystals Thieves in the Night After night falls Umang awakens in Nikifor's cabin You will need to access the storeroom again so you can sneak out the port hole and find your way to the Shadow Legion camp their vehicles and the crystals However since your last visit down to the engine you've reset the crystals so you'll have to reset them again to unlock the door to the storeroom
Leave the cabin and turn right to access the main staircase through the double doors Turn right and go to the generator room door You're literally able to find your way in the dark by now Go down to the engine Open the panel and turn off two crystals just one crystal is lit Push the WHITE BUTTON on the top panel Retrace your steps up to Nikifor's cabin passing it to stop at the storeroom door on your left Click on the door to enter Go to the port hole and use your rope from inventory on the ladder on the wall beneath the port hole Ready Take a deep breath and out you go down the rope SAVE YOUR GAME

If you continue without doing this sudden death will be your consequence Pan slightly right and go forward three times
You have arrived in the meadow where the soldiers have parked their vehicles
Click on the left vehicle A warning will let you know that the panel housing the power crystal is rusty Use your oil can on the lid to keep it from squeaking and alerting the sleeping warriors Open the lid Remove theFOURTH CRYSTALusing your crystal capsule

Pan left and go forward
Ditch your water lamp when you are warned Go forward once
Turn left Go forward twice and climb the rope back to the storeroom
Whew Good going Umang If I were there with you I'd be high fiving you big time
As you leave the storeroom Nikifor will appear and suggest that a good night's sleep is in order
Umang responds quot It sounds like a plan quot Morning comes Let's get back down to the engine to install those two stolen crystals Nikifor is already out and gone Leave the cabin and turn right
Go out the double doors and go back down to the engine
Install the two new crystals with the crystal capsule
Click on the crystals to activate four of them and press the corresponding LIGHT BLUE button on the upper panel
Go back out up the main staircase through both sets of double doors
Use one of the doors on either side to reenter the bridge
The Bridge at Last Fini Go to the wheel platform up front and approach the pedestal on the far left Place the lever in the light blue first position The panel on the bridge wall will activate Back out and go right to the steering wheel
Look at the symbols displayed on the control panel Make a note or remember what they look like The symbols depicted there now illustrate the current position of the vehicle But we want to get the heck out here
Go down the steps and over to the right to that tall table we couldn't operate earlier
THE NAVIGATION PUZZLE In closeup the metal plate will open to show four identical symbols Access your journal to find four symbols lined up horizontally
The four symbols are an open eye a character resembling a curly W an open hand another open eye When you enter the four symbols correctly the panel will close and the table will rotate displaying a vague map Umang says quot I need the exact coordinates quot You have them in your journal
But first we need to establish a starting point which is our current location On the small panel at right enter the last two of the three symbols you just saw up on the steering wheel control panel The first position will not activate Note that the indicator on the map moves to our current location Now we need to find the Manula Valley where the Keepers' portal is located The Captain's Diary in the den has an illustration of the Manula Valley topography
To find the Manula Valley pull the top lever three times You should see the Manula Valley map as depicted in the diary Now remember or check the directions from the Manula Valley to quot the land of the forgotten quot That is S S W W S W N W S From this position we can figure out how to get from here to the Manula Valley so the directions are backwards N E S E N E E N N Umang is elated
quot Got it Excellent
Now we have the coordinates quot Clever you Now using the dial at the bottom right on the map panel enter these coordinates When entered correctly Umang will let you know Take note of the symbols above the dial for the Manula Valley
Make a note of them if you need to Go to the steering wheel and enter the three symbols on the control panel
When entered correctly you'll be automatically taken out of the close up
Okay good
The next step is in the engine room again as we'll need to fire up the other critical engine installed on the roof of the vehicle I'm absolutely positive you can find your way down to the engine with no problem Once there open the panel Light up the fifth crystal Press the GREEN button middle on the right on the top panel
Go back up to the bridge and the steering wheel platform Pan down left and pull the lever on the floor
NOTE If nothing happens and you get a message from Umang that you've missed something read through this walkthrough so far to make sure you've completed all actions and have acquired all inventory items in red ink Also if you have incidentally picked up the last sixth crystal from the compressor room and or have already installed it in the generator panel return it to the machine in the compressor room Then check the engine panel to make sure you have five crystals lit and the green button pushed
Picking up and or installing the sixth crystal before it is needed will keep the vehicle from operating
As you pull the lever next to the steering wheel the engine comes alive in a cutscene Wheels gears joints belts and pistons move and fire The vehicle rises sprouts insect like legs and begins creaking and clanking to move toward its plotted destination
The vehicle summarily snuffs out one of the Shadow Legion warriors as it goes
Early on and while rounding a corner in a narrow canyon Umang is unable to successfully navigate the awkard vehicle through a narrow cut in the rocks The vehicle is caught crippled and it stalls
Nikifor announces quot Well here we are quot But the two of them don't have much time More of the Shadow Legion warriors will soon arrive and they have to find a way to quot seal the passage quot Nikifor charters Umang to come up with a plan
Run Like a Rabbit
Leave the bridge and take the main staircase down to the compressor room Time to extract that sixth crystal When you get there use your crystal capsule to take the crystal from the machine against the wall to the right of the compressor and return down the corridor to the engine Install the crystal Light the last crystal making sure all six are glowing Now click on the bottom right RED button This button activates the vehicle's self destruct system If you check your journal you'll see Self destruct Use with extreme caution at the proper time
When activated RUN
SAVE YOUR GAME Go immediately back to the bridge via the main staircase and the two double doors
In the lower area of the bridge access the bookcase again by pushing the latch to enter the Secret Room
Push the button on the desk to open the large cabinet opposite In close up Umang says quot I have no other choice quot Check your journal to see the chart that shows that all the tubes must have their red bands postioned at the top the object of the puzzle
THE SELF DESTRUCT PUZZLE Note that when you click on one of the six capsules the action prompts the revolution of at least two other tubes
The puzzle is not difficult
Click capsule numbers left to right and RUN
When the puzzle is successfully completed the vehicle's self destruct system activates in a cutscene and Umang and Nikifor run to safety just in the nick of time
As the scene settles Nikifor is absolutely furious with Umang for blowing up his quot house quot He raves and rants ultimately telling Umang that he is out of there exclaiming quot Get lost quot EPISODE TWO THE MANULA VALLEY SAVE YOUR GAME When Umang recovers from the loss of both the vehicle and Nikifor turn around to see the vehicle foundered among the rocks Pick up theIRON BAR Turn to the right and continue through the canyon going forward five times When you reach the edge of a cliff seeing mist off to your right turn right Go up the path four times and pan left to see a small cable transport system leading to an area on a central rock pinnacle in the canyon Stop Go forward and check out the transport system's controls Open the lid of the lower compartment and see the imprint of some sort of tool or odd key
Turn around to go back to the trail Go left and forward up the hill until you see a large circular stone platform Go on up to the edge of the platform a Keepers Clan's portal and see that the center is comprised of three concentric rings Pan down right to see a hole in the stone Click on it to get a message from Umang that something is needed there to stop the stone from moving What do you have in your inventory that might just do the job Yup the newly acquired iron bar from the vehicle's wreckage
Pan up and look at the statues around the platform and the way a pipe extends down from a statue and a pinkish colored pedestal above you on the right Recall this scene from the drawing of a Keepers' portal from the Captain's Diary in the vehicle's den
Turn around Go back down the hill three times and pan left to see a stone staircase Climb it When your each the top turn left and walk out on the little balcony
Pan up over your right shoulder to check out the stone statue with a globe in its hands and the pipe's downward path Pan down and click on the stone podium at the edge of the balcony
In a cutscene Michael the caretaker of this broken Keepers' Portal arrives He's been waiting for Umang the quot Chosen One quot He tells the story of the Keepers the artifacts and in using the tetrahedrons for exploring other worlds how they mistakenly opened the world of the warlike Shadow Legion The world where the portal is located was the Keepers' home but the Shadow Legion gained control of the portal and was able to infiltrate the Keepers' world Eventually after a long and bloody war the Keepers had to abandon this world to the Shadow Legion Now the Shadow Legion wants the rings and the tetrahedrons in order to pursue the Keepers Clan As the Chosen One Umang must find the Sacred Rings now in the palace in the lair of the Shadow Legion and protect the artifacts as Arakon asked of him He's to make sure the Shadow Legion is not ever again able to continue their evil quest to find the Keepers and steal the artifacts
But first Umang must figure out how to restore this portal to get to the Shadow Legion's lair at the palace
THE PORTAL PUZZLE When Michael disappears go to the podium and study the pattern of the stone rings on the right side This is the correct alignment of the rings
Achieving the correct alignment is the object of the puzzle
You've already placed the iron bar in the hole near the edge of the rings so turn the middle ring on the left side of the podium times
turn the small inside ring times
Oh boy
That cannot be good In a cutscene the portal powers up and then abruptly subsides Something isn't right Michael reappears to inform you that you need another energy source as powerful as this one was Michael says you must quot ask the sky quot and you must find the Shadow Legion's sign Michael gives Umang theFERRY KEY Oh
So that little conveyance down the hill is a ferry Kind of a quot mid air ferry quot I guess
Anyway it looks like Umang will now be able to operate it Go back down the stairs turn left and go down the trail to the ferry
Approach the platform and in close up open the lower compartment and insert the key from your inventory Turn the upper wooden handle to bring the ferry car over to your side of the canyon Climb aboard Turn left and pan down to turn the handle which propels the car across the cable system On the other side go to the platform at the other end of the trail Turn left and climb into the rail car which has been resting here unused for a very long time Umang hopes quot this still works quot
THE FAIRY WORLD Click on the bottom left button on the console and pull the lever After a remarkable ride you arrive in a green rainy world Leave the rail car and go along the path to see a pedestal in front of an arch bridge with an active portal You can go up onto the bridge but you will not be able to pass before solving the puzzle on the pedestal
THE BRIDGE PUZZLE Approach the pedestal In closeup see four stone buttons left to right purple blue gray green and yellow They represent fire ice smoke and electricity Press the buttons When the blue button is pressed Umang will say quot Let me through or I will break you quot This is the obvious clue to solving the puzzle After you press the blue button again go up on the bridge and use your crowbar from inventory to break the ice in the portal
The crowbar returns to inventory
When the ice shatters follow the trail across the little wooden foot bridge and up to the house This is the home of Reina the resident fairy who has an ill natured personality and considerable magical powers
Look closely at the frog and globe emblem on the door of the house Note that there are three rods or rays emanating from the globe This is a clue to gaining entry Go through the door and end up back outside Hmmm
That's weird Reenter the door twice more and you will gain entry Three rays on the frog and globe emblem three attempts to enter Its very dark in here but there's a door straight ahead and a bit left of you Use your cursor to guide you into Reina's inner sanctum Go forward and left to see Reina seated at a tall desk Click on her She introduces herself as a kind fairy
She's also likely a sorceress
Click on her again Umang asks if she knows of the sign of the Shadow Legion and if she knows about the Keepers' portal Reina is not very helpful Click on her a third time She has no more to say right now
Swing to your right and investigate the book shelf Take the bright green bottle ofPHOSPHORUSon a shelf high at your left Find the book of magic spells at the end of the second shelf Open it to see descriptions and symbols for three essential weather spells fog rain and lightening On the facing page read what more may be needed the correct placement of mood statues on the altar to cast the required spell The three weather symbols are recorded in your journal
Turn to your right and leave the room Climb the steps and then the ladder ahead of you On the roof see three round trays The first tray holds a chubby statue The second and third trays are empty and display two of the three weather symbols from Reina's book of magic spells No action is available yet but this must be the altar where Reina performs the weather spells
Turn around
Go down the ladder the steps and turn left to exit the door with the globe to the outside Looks like we've accomplished all we can here for now but we'll be back shortly Follow the pathway across the wooden and stone bridges back to the rail car Choose the lower button on the right at the controls Pull the lever

THE MINE WORLD Wow What a lovely green park like location The bright sunshine feels pretty good for a change Go on down the trail and speak with Nafal the old man sitting on a bench in front of his home a hut on stilts Umang tells him of the need to fix the broken Keepers' portal and asks if he knows about the sign of the Shadow Legion Nafal knows very little He's only just heard of the Shadow Legion
Climb the ladder and enter the hut
Go forward then right and talk to the sick old lady in her bed Umang asks her about the portal but she doesn't know anything Turn around go forward then left to see a stylized kitchen counter Scan it left to right to pick up an emptyBOTTLE Back out of the close up and go right and forward to exit the hut
Outside go forward up the hill and along the path At the end you reach what appears to be an abandoned mine entrance Be sure to go forward to have a good look at the bells hanging in the oval metal frame Ring the bells if you wish You can't accomplish anymore now Go back down the hill and speak with Nafal again before leaving
FIRD'S STORY Umang wants to know how to get down in the mine Nafal reveals that the mine is the exile home of Fird the Shadow Legion's executioner Umang thinks Fird might likely would know plenty about the Shadow Legion Nafal tells Umang Fird's sad story Mila the concubine of the Shadow Legion leader Bargul was deeply in love and having an affair with Rizan Fird's good and beloved son Trey an advisor of Bargul learned of the affair and told Bargul As punishment Bargul ordered Fird to encase Mila in a wall while she was still alive and he ordered Fird to execute his own son Rizan When Fird refused Bargul ordered Gugon his evil sorcerer to cast a spell on Fird making it impossible for Fird to disobey So and sadly Fird carried out the order to bury Mila alive and he executed his own son Trey the advisor who betrayed Mila and Rizan was so guilt stricken by what he had done to Mila and Rizan in causing their deaths that he committed suicide It was said that Mila's ghost was haunting him Further Nafal tells Umang that Fird was given his son's ashes and having gone mad he aimlessly wandered the world for some time after that
Finally he settled at the bottom of the abandoned mine Nafal mentions that his wife Sarah takes food to Fird each day up at the mine
Go back up into the hut and speak with Sarah again about going into the mine to see Fird Sarah tells Umang she's been out of her headache medicine quot tincture of Lukerii quot for over a year Its patently obvious that Umang will get no cooperation from Sarah unless he can find the medicine for her Turn right

The third page displays Elements Level III which shows an extension of Level II elements and develops the formula for BINGO
Tincture of Lukerii Sulphur of the Philosopher and Slow Poison
Look closely at the formula for Tincture of Lukerii and see that by comparing the two bottom symbols of the formula with those symbols illustrated on the prior Elements page that the Tincture of Lukerii is comprised of equal parts Cure Oil and Moon Elixir As you'll recall this is the medication we need for poor old Sarah's debilitating headache
Now that you have cleverly extracted the formula go back to the dispenser on the right There are three sections to the dispenser
Note that each section highlights separately Click the top to rotate the capsules where the various elements are stored

The object of the puzzle is to light all the candles simultaneously all lit at once You must click on one candle then click on another If both stay lit click on a third
If the third stays lit click on a fourth Proceed until all are lit
If you choose the wrong candle you'll have to start over The Rules If you click on a tall candle next one is spaces away If you click on a medium candle next one is spaces away If you click on a short candle next one is space away
Red flame next candle is above Yellow flame next candle is left Green flame next candle is right Blue flame next candle is below Help Shortcut this is what I used RED above YELLOW left GREEN right BLUE below SHORT space MEDIUM spaces TALL spaces EXAMPLE If the candle you light is short and the flame is blue the next candle you light is one space below
If the candle you light is tall and the flame is red the next candle you light is three spaces above
If the candle you light is medium and the flame is yellow the next candle you light is to the left two spaces
If the candle you light is short and the flame is green the next candle you light is to the right one space

When you begin SafeCracker one of the first things you will encounter inside the Reception Room is a slider puzzle
It is billed as the most difficult puzzle in the whole game
I don't think so
So many people just hate sliders
Possibly they hate them because they don't understand the technique for solving them
Let's look at some diagrams and see how the technique works
Normally sliders are a square grid
They may be x as the one in safecracker is or x or x it doesn't matter how big they are
They don't have to be square for a rectangle such as x or x the concept remains the same
Traditionally the missing piece is the bottom right corner
The correct sequence for such a puzzle is to solve the top row first the second row next and so on until there are TWO rows remaining
Then the bottom two rows are solved together as a unit
Look first at the finished puzzle diagram below
Here we have numbered each piece sequentially from left to right and top to bottom
So if you see the image of the puzzle either before it is scrambled or after it is finished this is the way it looks
The numbers quot stick quot to the pieces themselves not the relative positions
To solve a single row go from left to right
Place piece one then two
To finish the row you must find pieces and and bring them up the side as shown
Then you can slide to the left and four up
The row is finished not to be disturbed again
Do the second row the same way
Put piece in place then piece and arrange and as shown
Finish the row as above
Most people even those who hate sliders can get this far on their own
Now for the important part
The bottom two rows must be solved together starting at the left
Identify pieces and and place them as shown
Then goes left and down with following it
Use the same technique with and
After you put pieces and in place pieces and can only be rotated
The programmers apparently forgot the Rule of Parity when they designed this puzzle and of the time it scrambles in such a way that it is unsolvable
You cannot tell until you reach the final stage whether you can finish or not
If it turns out that you cannot you must back away approach the safe again and do the puzzle over
This time hoping that you hit a solvable one
Anyway now that you understand sliders the second time through is a snap
The important thing is to realize that sometimes it is simply impossible and not to struggle but do it over
It's not your fault
Some variations on the original slider plan can make things pretty interesting
There is a slider in TimeLapse that gives people fits
It is a x with an interesting twist
It actually is made up of four x puzzles which quot snap quot together and cannot be moved or broken up once they snap together
One has to be careful not to solve the mini puzzles in the wrong order diagonally for example or your pieces get trapped
The safest way to avoid this is to do the top row and the leftmost column before completing any of the x sections
Also the same parity problem rears its head again
Half the time the solution is impossible
The idea suggested for the TimeLapse puzzle works for normal sliders as well
Start with the top row then the leftmost column followed by the remainder of the second row then the rest of the second column from the left working your way towards the bottom right corner
This method works well but it can be more difficult to accomplish only because the pieces can be hard to identify
It's easy if you have a reference image to refer to
The demon of all sliders is in the exploration phase of Puzz D 's Orient Express
This one is relatively enormous the outline is irregular and there are a few pieces locked into position so you must work around them
In addition there are several pieces with blank backgrounds only hence they all look the same yet they are unique and the solver is expected to figure out where they go somehow
If that's not enough the Finished image is not easily accessible
Guess you're expected to have a photographic memory
Puzz D Notre Dame has a good one a stained glass window
There is no reference image but the edge pieces are easily identified and the picture is not hard to figure out on the fly
Several websites offer sliders online Check out http www sandlotscience com Games Slider puzzles htmhttp www article com shockwave slider htm A great oneThe Balmoral site is a slider solver program
Unfortunately it only handles up to a x grid
You could use it for a x if you solve the top row and the left column treating the remainder as a x but if you can do that you can finish the puzzle manually
It's easier than running the solver
Enjoy your sliders now

Spring Jump to the links Safecracker is a highly non linear game
You are free to explore rooms and solve puzzles in your own sequence up to a point The exceptions are safes containing actual keys to open other safes you must obviously open the safe containing the key before you can use it or safes containing clues to other puzzles you don't necessarily have to have found all the clues if you decide to cheat
Also the entire house is not accessible in the beginning
Because you can go in many directions I am going to present the rooms innumerical order NOT in sequence
I will attempt to cross reference as accurately as possible to help you connect which puzzles relate to which others
The room numbers are the same as found on the maps found in the Reception Room Rm

After you open each safe be sure you remove all the contents before backing away
You cannot re open a safe and anything you leave in it will be locked in forever

Leave the prison through this opening
Yard You emerge under a porch that opens up onto a yard filled with mounts and baggage
There are some guards in the area but luckily they are somewhat far away and not looking in your direction Move forward towards the yard
You walk by a pillar on which a lovely young woman is leaning it is Salammb daughter of the general Hamilcar and grand priestess of Tanith Click on Salammb to speak with her
She offers to help you leave the city if you agree to bring a statuette to the mercenary chief M tho with whom she is secretly in love
Accept this deal The dialog now over follow Salammb 's advice and go hide among the baggage piled up in the yard
The following sequence is presented in the form of a comic strip
Comic Strip Hidden among the bags of the treasurer Hannon you leave the sacred precinct and exit the city of Carthage
Hannon is off to pay the mercenaries the money that is still owed them
The treasurer and his escort stop a short ways from the mercenary camp and you take advantage of the general excitement to leave your hiding spot
Sadly you drop the statuette given to you by Salammb and it breaks
Mercenary camp and surrounding area Doors to Carthage Hannon's tent Moloch's finger upright stone M tho's tent Autharite's tent Potter's stall Wine merchant's stall Narr rsquo Havas' tent Pariahs' village Waterworks Backcountry road Important If lost look at the sky
The red star of Moloch indicates the north
Hannon's tent a Drinking trough and mount b Hannon's tent back door c Towards Moloch's finger H Hannon on his tank G Carthaginian guards M Mercenaries come to get the money still owed them You leave your hiding place at a behind Hannon's tent near a trough where a mount is drinking Be especially careful to not go near the Carthaginians your shackled hands reveal your status as an escaped slave and they would capture you immediately Go to c and continue towards the south
You reach a paved road near an upright stone that the local people call quot Moloch's finger quot Head to the right and follow the road partly covered with sand leading to the mercenary camp
At M tho's tent The first tent you reach is M tho's
It is guarded by two sentries
Answer their questions honestly and you rsquo ll be allowed to enter the chief mercenary's tent Give the broken statuette to M tho
He gets mad and insists that you fix it You won't be able to carry out this task with your shackled hands
Go to the Gaul Autharite who has blacksmith's tools Leave M tho's tent turn around and click the area to the left of the tent
Cross the road and continue to walk in a southerly direction until you reach Autharite's tent
At Autharite's tent Autharite is not there when you enter his tent
Click on the hammer and scissors that are on the chest
The tools fall making a frightful noise
Autharite alerted by the din emerges
Livid he speaks of handing you over to the Carthaginians To calm him down agree to play the game of cottabe with him
This game consists of throwing a helmet on a shield Autharite has been drinking and his aim is poor
But be careful
If you trounce the Gallic chief he rsquo ll become upset and hand you over to the enemy Always aiming outside of the target is not the solution either this will also anger Autharite for he likes a close game To win him over you will need to choose the middle of the road let him win but only after having proved to be a worthy opponent Here's the easiest way to proceed bull Win the first game bull Propose a rematch to Autharite bull Lose the second game A satisfied Autharite removes your chains
Your hands are now free
Leave Autharite's tent head to the right then again to the right until you reach a stall run by a Gallic potter
Potter's stall Chat with the potter to obtain some general information Put the broken statuette on the table the artisan gives you a pot of glue Use the glue to fix the statuette Take the object you rsquo ve repaired and return to M tho's tent
Back at M tho's tent Give the repaired statuette to M tho
He accepts the statuette but selfishly refuses to protect you
You rsquo ll have to manage on your own Turn the mercenaries against Carthage so as to avoid being taken prisoner again
You can do this by making sure they don't get paid the money they are owed this will involve stealing the money kept under guard in Hannon's tent
This feat is possible but only if you can draw the sentry on guard behind the tent away from his post
To do this you will need two objects bull a wineskin filled with quot elephant wine quot a powerful drug given to the war elephants prior to battle so that they will be thirsty for combat bull a daggerWhen you exit M tho's tent turn left and head directly north towards the section of the camp occupied by Narr rsquo Havas and his Numidian cavalrymen When you reach the first Numidian tent turn left and go to in front of the wine merchant's stall
Wine merchant's stall A drunk Numidian is guarding the stall
Ask him for something to drink
He refuses but reveals to you one of the three ingredients used to make elephant wine pepper Move away from the stall then go back
The Numidian is on the ground snoring
Take advantage of this opportunity to enter the stall and find the complete formula for making elephant wine On the stall are a jug of wine a bowl and four flasks respectively containing brimstone flour yellow pepper black pimento red incense blue and salt white Take the black flask and single click on the bowl to pour in a measure of pepper
In the same manner add a measure of red pimento and two measures of blue incense Take the jug and pour its contents into the bowl
You will obtain a bubbling purple liquid the elephant wine Take the empty wineskin that lays on the table
and click on the bowl
You gather a good portion of elephant wine that will be useful to you at a later point Turn to the right move forward then turn to the right yet again to head towards the center of the circle formed by the Numidian tents
Turn around you are facing Narr rsquo Havas chief of the Numidian cavalry who is having tea in front of his tent
Narr rsquo Havas Speak with Narr rsquo Havas exploring every possible avenue bull Ask him to help you he refuses bull Beg him to allow you to join his group he refuses yet again bull Insist that he brings you with him to his native country again he refuses bull Ask him for a weapon he gives you a dagger Armed with this blade and the elephant wine go back to the area behind Hannon's tent
Stealing the treasure a Drinking trough and mount b Hannon's tent back door c Towards Moloch's finger H Hannon on his tank G Carthaginian guards M Mercenaries come to get the money still owed them Avoiding the guards go to a near the mount
Pour the elephant wine into the trough
The mount drinks some of liquid and runs off at a gallop its insides on fire
The sentry on guard behind the tent at b abandons his post to chase the mount
A gauge is displayed on the screen to show you the time available until the guard returns Without taking any detours or losing any time whatsoever go immediately to the door b that is now with the sentry's disappearance no longer being guarded
To the left through the tent's canvas you see a bent over silhouette it's Hannon's interpreter filling a bag with the money destined to the mercenaries
Stab the man through the canvas
Use your dagger to sever in one swipe the leather cords tying the tent door shut
Don rsquo t waste time individually undoing them by hand
Enter the tent
The interpreter's body is lying in front of a chest
Take the bag of money found inside this chest and leave immediately
Comic Strip Now without his interpreter and having lost the money Hannon confronts the angry mercenaries
Throw a stone at him to provoke a riot
The treasurer and his escort flee towards the city
Your plan has worked to perfection
You enter the mercenary camp with the treasure hidden beneath your clothing
Chiefs' council Autharite stops you on the road to the camp near Moloch's finger
He's figured out what you've been up to
It's useless to deny it acknowledge the truth and offer him a deal The Gaul wants the stolen money
Hand over the treasure to him without argument
In exchange he introduces you at the Chiefs' council
It's now up to you to do what it takes so that the friction between the mercenaries and Carthage degenerates into an all out war The mercenary chiefs greet the general Hamilcar sent by Carthage as a negotiator You will get involved in the conversation a number of times
Always choose the reply that will lead to the events that you wish to bring about When Hamilcar calls for justice for the attack and thievery that Hannon has been subjected to reply quot Nothing strange for the men to have gotten carried away
They've about run out of patience quot Hamilcar is astonished at the mercenaries' anger particularly given that the treasurer had begun to pay them the money that was owed them
Reply quot Hannon's flight stopped the payments
When will they begin again quot Hamilcar then calls upon the mercenaries to hold an inquiry
Retort quot We shouldn't have to hold an inquiry quot Hamilcar is amazed at your reply
Go on to say quot It's not the mercenaries' responsibility to investigate this
The treasure was under the guard of Carthage when it was stolen quot Hamilcar annoyed expresses his fear that there will be quot a war that may prove very bad for everyone quot
Conclude with quot That would be unfortunate but everyone should be responsible for his actions quot After Hamilcar's departure Narr rsquo Havas frets he feels that attacking Carthage would be a foolish move
Other chiefs agree with him
Reassure them by stating quot You're invincible
Remember your victories against Rome quot M tho is hesitant to fight against Salammb 's native country
Tell him quot Destroy the city and Salammb will be yours
Harden your heart M tho for you have no other choice quot Narr rsquo Havas is afraid of defeat at the hands of Carthage's allies
Argue that quot Carthage takes advantages of its allies
They will revolt as soon as they see that the city is having difficulties quot The Etruscan chief recognizable by his closed helmet declares that no one shall rebel against the Carthaginians as long as they possess the Zaimph the sacred veil of Tanith
Propose a plan of action quot Let's put together an expedition to go get the Zaimph quot No one will volunteer to carry out such a risky action objects Narr rsquo Havas
Put an end to the discussion by volunteering to do so yourself quot I'll go alone to Carthage and bring back the Zaimph quot Act Objective Steal the Zaimph You rsquo ve promised the mercenary chiefs that you will bring them the Zaimph
To do this you will need to bull return to Carthage knowing that the city's doors are sealed following the riot against Hannon bull return to the sacred precinct bull find the Temple of Tanith steal the Zaimph and return to the mercenary camp all without being apprehended
Mercenary campGathering material Go see Narr rsquo Havas
Ask him how to penetrate into the city of Carthage
He refuses to have any part of your problem
Insist quot I am about to undertake huge risks on behalf of everyone
You must help me quot Narr rsquo Havas gives you a bow a weapon quot for killing sentinels from a distance and without making any noise quot Go to Autharite's tent
Ask the Gaul how to enter the city of Carthage then tell him quot I need equipment to be able to complete my mission quot He gives you an iron bar and climbing crampons Pariahs' villageGo find the pariahs that live at south of the mercenary camp
To enter their village tell the sentry that you can kill pigs with your bow The chief of the pariahs requires that you kill three pigs that are running around the village
This is not an easy task for you must hit the animals without injuring the men who are chasing them
If your marksmanship is poor use the F key
This shortcut allows you to automatically carry out this challenge The pariahs roast the pigs you rsquo ve killed and prepare a feast Ask the chief about the big long structure located behind the village
He replies that it rsquo s the waterworks installation that supplies Carthage with water
Ask him how to scale this structure
He tells you about the only spot where this can be done WaterworksFollowing the chief's instructions leave the village turn left and go to to the roots of a giant ivy plant that is growing on the waterworks Sentries are posted atop the structure but they rsquo re relaxed and their guard are down
Take advantage of this to climb the ivy using your climbing crampons Once atop the structure you notice guards facing away from you
Do not approach them rather aim the nearest one and fell him with an arrow The guard falls off the structure
Go to the place where he was standing
You will find his shield placed next to a closed shaft Turn the shield round Remove the leather strap from the shield and place it in your inventory Use your iron bar to open the shaft Enter the waterworks passage Head to the left
A grate blocks the passage
Its bars both at the top and to the left are rusted
Attach the shield's leather strap to this fragile part of the grate then use your iron bar on the strap The bar acts as a lever around which the strap wraps itself the bars will bend closer to one another then break

At the end of the meeting the room empties and you remain behind alone
You take a staircase leading down to the crypts hoping to find a path that will take you to the Temple of Tanith
Door of terror Move straight ahead
You come upon a closed door garnished with medallions
Clicking on a medallion makes it flip over displaying on its other side the head of a howling demon
It rsquo s time to consult your log to recall the words uttered by the old man king of the birds quot As each pair of demons howls in unisonThe door of terror will open up for you quot The riddle is interpreted as follows The demons sculpted on the medallions form pairs that let out the same howl
If you successively click on two heads of a same pair they remain displayed but if you click on two dissimilar heads they disappear once they have howled
To open the door you must display all the heads The table below shows where the pairs are located Treasure room Door of terror Keys Manuscripts Shelf Cavity containing a map and papyrus Clawed statue P Priestess whose body is pierced by a stake V Precious vases You enter the Carthaginian republic's treasure room The door of terror closes behind you with a sinister slamming noise
Going back on your footsteps is now impossible this room was designed to trap thieves it is much more difficult to escape it than it is to gain entry
To find a way out begin by carefully and systematically exploring the entire area
The center of the room is dedicated to a stone edicule
It is surrounded by poisoned stakes a deathly trap which although it once worked is now luckily for you defused At P lies the body of the thief who triggered the trap's mechanism
Approach her body and pick up the objects that have fallen out of her hands a piece of flint and a set of keys
Bypass the edicule on the right
At the stone wall has nine openings three of which contain rolls of papyrus
They are account books containing the details of the revenues of the Carthaginian republic taxes farm rent customs duties etc
The most interesting of the books is the one in the opening located at the bottom to the right
Click on the roll to read the text
It is as follows Profits in Roman numerals Profits in Carthaginian numerals Headings in the Carthaginian alphabet XXXVII CCCXXXXV IIII XVIIII XXXII II VIIII I III LVIIIITitle The title of the manuscript is at the bottom
The Carthaginians in fact wrote from right to left and bottom to top contrary to what is prevalent in the modern Western world The page is divided into three columns bull The sources of profits are in the right hand column bull The middle column contains the profits in Carthaginian numerals
They are distinguished from letters by the horizontal line above them bull The column to the left includes the values of the middle column expressed in ancient Roman numerals Studying this document gives rise to a few obvious concordances Now go to the spot in front of the shelf
Take the hammer that is found there and go to
On this side the wall of the edicule has nine keys much alike those of a modern digicode
The only difference is the position of the numbers which follows the Carthaginian rules
The numbers associated with each key are therefore as follows The challenge is now to find out the digicode's purpose and the numbers to be entered When you drugged Hannon at the tavern you noticed a strange tattoo on his arm
Consult your log to refresh your memory
Hannon treasurer of the republic had the combination of the chests for which he was responsible tattooed on his arm The concordances deduced from the account book let you transcribe the tattoo into more modern Roman numerals To find the combination you need only to read Hannon's tattoo from bottom to top in the Carthaginian manner
With the hammer you took from the shelf hit one after another the keys and finally
You trigger a mechanism that opens up six cavities in the walls of the room Four of the six cavities contain extremely heavy precious vases ndash proof that Carthage's finances are definitely doing well and that the senator's greed was the only thing responsible for the mercenaries not being paid what they were owed on time Take the vase located in cavity
You find a roll in the very depth of the cavity
Click to open it it contains a map of the area surrounding Carthage and a long strip of papyrus on which are written Carthaginian characters
Take this papyrus then put the vase back in the cavity Go back to
Use the flint in your inventory to light the oil lamp above the shelf and then use the lamp to set fire to the papyrus strip
Keep the burning papyrus in your hand if you place it in your inventory the fire will die out and you rsquo ll have to light it again You must now go to near the statue to activate a mechanism that will allow you to leave the room
Be careful
In this spot the ground is but a thin floor underneath which is hidden a stake filled pit
Ensure that there are no precious vases in your inventory these are so heavy that they would cause you to crash through the planks of the floor
This trap however is only designed for thieves and is not dangerous if you don rsquo t try to take any of the vases out of the room Be sure that you are at with your back to the statue and not at facing it
Use your burning papyrus to light up the coals filling a saucer located in front of you The resulting flame heats up a metal wire which in turn dilates and triggers a mechanism that causes the statue to rotate
The ensuing rotation transports you out of the room Look at the flagstones at your feet they form arrows
Follow the directions indicated by the arrows and after a series of passages and stairs you will reach a pavilion located in the Gardens of Tanith
Gardens of Tanith Pavilion Perch Fountain Slumber grove Priestess' hall Towards the Temple of Tanith You arrive in the pavilion
Go to the center of the room and open the chest on your right
Take the mask and pestle that are inside it Leave the pavilion and position yourself in front of the perch Review in your log the subsequent instructions given by the old man quot hellip In the sacred groves a female bird singsAnd the bicephalous bird a male is caught in the trap quot Take the princess bird from your inventory it is the quot female bird quot referred to in the riddle
Place it on the perch Take the pot of glue that rsquo s in your inventory and cover the branch located above and to the right of the perch with glue
Click on the princess bird to make it sing
Her song attracts a two headed male bird which alights on the branch and remains glued to it
Capture it using the empty cage in your inventory The bicephalous bird will be useful later on when you will be in the Temple of Tanith This building your final destination is close by since it can be accessed from the gardens by passing through the hall However there is a problem
A priestess stands guard in this room and will not let you go by
It rsquo s useless to try and convince her much less threaten her ndash she will only call the guards
Rather have another look at the old man's instructions quot hellip Near the slumbering monster grow three sleep inducing flowersTo be picked ground and then thrown in the fire Put she who watches to sleep etc quot This passage refers to the slumber grove where a sleeping dragon lies
You must gather the flowers that grow in this bed crush them with the pestle then throw the powder thus obtained into the incense burner located at the entrance to the hall
The smoke will put the priestess quot she who watches quot to sleep and you will be able to enter the temple
But be careful
If you are not adequately protected you will also lose consciousness To stop this from happening don the mask in your inventory ndash exactly as you put on Hannon's regalia before entering the sacred precinct If you speak to anyone the mask will immediately return to your inventory
In such a case do not forget to put it on again before being exposed to the sleep inducing smoke
Now that we have explained how it should work in theory it rsquo s time to put our instructions into practice
Carry out the following actions in the order they are listed bull Don the mask bull Enter the slumber grove
bull Gather the three sleep inducing flowers dream flower red forgetting flower white and night flower blue bull Go back to the pavilion bull Place the three flowers in the metal saucer near the chest bull Use the pestle in your inventory to crush the flowers bull Take the saucer containing the flower powder bull Enter the hall
Go through the door but no further
Sitting on a bench the priestess who watches over the site is singing and playing the harp
She turns her back to you paying you no mind
Pour some of the flower powder in the incense burner to your left
The smoke acts as a drug and puts the priestess to sleep
The smoke of the incense acts as a drug and puts the priestess to sleep Cross the hall and follow the passage to the Temple of Tanith
Temple of Tanith Secondary door Main door Stairs Stairs Statue of Tanith Cameos Amphitheatre You enter the temple via a secondary door
The main door is closed and the building deserted
The Zaimph the goal of your quest is draped around the statue of Tanith at
Go to the foot of one of the sets of stairs leading to the statue
A threatening serpent blocks your path Take the bicephalous bird from your inventory and place it on the perch protruding from the wall
The bird begins to sing You recognize the melody it rsquo s the same tune as the priestess was playing in the hall The serpent dances a moment to this melody then disappears leaving the passage open You rsquo ve just solved the last part of the old man's riddle quot hellip charm the guardianAnd close your hand over the sacred veil quot There remains however one obstacle that the king of the birds neglected to mention a deadly force field surrounding the Zaimph To disable this magical barrier go to
Take the cameos found in a box at your feet
Then raise your eyes and look to the left for a cavity filled cartouche where the cameos are to be encased The cameos you have in your possession are engraved with the following symbols crescent star dragon serpent galley sea mountains shepherd There is a link between these symbols and the hymn sung by the priestess in the hall
Open your log and look over the words of the song quot Sometimes thin and bent like a galley with no masts she glides over a black sea
Sometimes shiny and round she skims the peaks of mountains like a shepherd among the stars quot The words we have underlined correspond to certain of the cameo symbols To access the Zaimph you need to rewrite the words of the song in the form of a puzzle bull In the upper section of the cartouche place the underlined symbols according to the Carthaginian manner of reading star shepherd mountains sea galley bull In the lower section you must place the cameo that corresponds to the title of the song
Seeing as the words conjure up the heavenly body of the moon associated with Tanith the sought out symbol is the crescent of Tanith
Once the cameos are in the proper position they will emit a blue light and the force field will be disabled Climb to a spot in front of the statue of Tanith
Take the Zaimph
A magical alarm is immediately triggered
The guards will soon be upon you
How can you protect yourself
Remember that the Zaimph provokes a sacred fear in all Carthaginians
Wrap the veil around you as though it were a piece of clothing the guards will not dare touch you for fear of damaging the Zaimph Go to the center of the room
You find yourself face to face with Salammb
She calls you sacrilegious and a thief and demands that you give her the veil
Refuse and click near the main door of the temple henceforth open Guards bearing javelins appear from behind the pillars intent on blocking your path
But seeing the Zaimph stops them cold no man will dare stop you while you are wearing the veil
The domestic monkey that has just entered the temple however has no such inhibitions
You rsquo ll need to wheedle him and win him over otherwise he rsquo ll steal the veil leaving you defenseless against the guards Take the magic fruit floating above the cup for gifts
Give this fruit to the monkey and while he eats it leave the room by the main door
Comic Strip From the temple descend into the yard of the sacred precinct
You manage to get hold of an elephant and hoist yourself atop the mount
You triumphantly return to the mercenary camp
Act Objective Destroy the waterworks You have brought back the Zaimph
M tho immediately gives you another mission break the waterworks supplying Carthage with water This feat achieved you will then need to rally the mercenaries driven out of their camp by the Carthaginian army and lead them to victory Mercenary camp Doors to Carthage Moloch's finger M tho's tent Autharite's tent Potter's stall Wine merchant's stall Narr rsquo Havas' tent Pariahs' village Waterworks Backcountry road M tho holds a gathering of the mercenary chiefs in his tent to organize the operations against Carthage
He goes off on a mission to the coastal cities Narr rsquo Havas heads off to check on supplies Autharite is responsible for guarding the camp and you are in charge of sabotaging the waterworks
Upon leaving M tho's tent go to the pariahs' village and speak to the chief
He tells you that the structure is better guarded than ever and that it is now impossible to scale Call up the interface with a right click and consult the map of the area
You note that the waterworks capture water coming from deep inside the mountains
Seeing as the structure is closely guarded near the city the solution will require sabotaging it nearer to the water source
Go to the road leading towards the backcountry Talk to the mercenary who is posted there
Insist that he lend you a mount
He does not dare refuse you given how popular you rsquo ve become in the camp since your return with the Zaimph Click on a mount
A map appears giving you two possible choices as to your destination the Solitude Mountains and the Hatchet Mountain Pass
Click on the second option
Hatchet Mountain Pass Entrance to the pass Ledge Insect nest Rocky spur Dragon rocks Lost temple Enter the pass while your mount waits for you at
Head towards the entrance to an underground temple that is linked to the tunnel that collects the waterworks rsquo water Unfortunately as you arrive at you are pursued by a ravenous dragon of the sand
Immediately make a half turn and take the quickest route to the ledge i e via the rocky spur where you can seek refuge
On the ledge pick up a stone to your left and throw it at the insect nest
Your throw unleashes a swarm which attacks the dragon and chases it away Backtrack to your previous location
Take the skull from the skeleton that is leaning against the wall Go down to the base of the ledge where the dragon was previously
On the ground is a pool of green saliva that it left behind
From your inventory take the empty pot that used to hold the glue and use it to gather up the saliva Continue moving forward until you reach the Lost temple
Lost temple Hatchet Mountain Pass Hall of the Lost temple Room of the eye Stairs Waterworks Vaulted room a Hole in the wall Solitude Mountains S Secret doors Hall You enter into the hall of a very ancient temple built by the Carthaginians at the time their city was created
This temple is dedicated to Tanith and Moloch
It includes secret halls reserved solely for the initiated where one can only enter after having solved sacred riddles First bypass the hall's central pillar and position yourself in front of the vertical cartouche dug out of the rock On a shelf there are cameos similar to those you manipulated in Act to get hold of the Zaimph Click on the engraved text beneath the cameos
The translated text is displayed quot He who maps outThe city precinctWill continue on his wayTowards the sacred couple quot The riddle is interpreted as follows If you symbolically reproduce the layout of the walls of Carthage on the cartouche a secret door leading to the Room of the eye will open in this room there are two statues representing Tanith and Moloch the sacred couple Call up the interface open the map of the area and look at the ramparts of Carthage
These ramparts consist of main towers along with the Temples of Tanith and Moloch which are part of the precinct
All of these elements form the following figure Temple of Moloch Temple of TanithStar TowerBull TowerDragon TowerSerpent Tower Reproduce this plan on the cartouche by linking each building with the cameo symbolizing it
Crescent for the Temple of Tanith globe for Moloch star for the Star Tower etc
When this step is completed and the cartouche resembles the depiction above a secret door will open behind you
Pass through this door and walk until you reach the Room of the eye
Room of the eye a Statue of Tanith b Statue of Moloch c Roll d Drawer You enter a sanctuary where the priests of Carthage used to carry out sacrifices
The statue of Moloch would then raise its one eyelid to feast on the spectacle taking place Your goals are to first steal the eye of Moloch then to open the south door leading towards the waterworks
To do this you will need to carry out ancient rituals
The papyrus found in Carthage's treasure room will give you important instructions
It is in fact a sacred text cut into a thin strip so as to render it impossible to read
Place this strip at c it will wrap itself around the support attached to the altar and the characters will align themselves revealing the legible text quot Place the tomb of thoughts on the engraved diskThen pour in saliva from the killer Look deep into Tanith's eyes Seize the motionless hour where the water goddess In the celestial home of the killer Passes in front of Moloch a red and torrid fire quot Skirt around the altar and make your way to d
Take the skull quot the tomb of thoughts quot in your inventory and place it on the symbol of Moloch quot the engraved disk quot From your inventory take the pot filled with dragon saliva quot saliva from the killer quot and pour it into the skull
The skull imbeds itself into the altar Turn around Moloch has raised his eyelid displaying his red eye Walk towards the statue and use your dagger to remove the eye
Now go to a and click on Tanith's eyes
You are contemplating the world of the stars
On a backdrop of constellations the trajectories of the red globe of Moloch and the crescent of Tanith are intertwined
Use the cursor at the bottom of the screen to stop the image on the union pattern of trajectories described by the riddle Tanith in front of Moloch with a dragon constellation in the background quot the celestial home of the killer quot If you have some difficulty to control the stars use the F key
This shortcut allows you to automatically carry out this challenge
Release the mouse button
The screen becomes bright and you leave the world of the stars to return to the room
You notice that the south door is now open
Before passing through this door go back to d and consider the horns sticking up from the altar
Click on the th one from the right
From the drawer that opens take a strange key in the form of a demon's head
Destroying the waterworks Go to the foot of the stairs
Piled up rubble prevents you from climbing the stairs
Head to the right following a passage that will bring you to next to a canal that forms the waterworks' underground structure
Stay as close to the exit as possible and throw the eye of Moloch into the current
There is a violent reaction when the red globe hits the water
Make your way back to without wasting even a second
A tremendous explosion destroys the waterworks closing off the gallery behind you
Mission accomplished
At you see that the explosion has brought down the rubble that was blocking the stairway
Climb up into a large vaulted room then turn to the left and go down towards a closed door S
Open this door by using the demon key in the lock that is dug into the wall on the right You emerge at the bottom of a crevasse
The door closes behind you but you can easily open it again by using the key on the outside lock For the time being follow the crevasse
You emerge at on a desolate plateau the Solitude Mountains Solitude Mountains Idol Moloch Pond S Secret door leading to the Lost temple Lock of the secret door M Disheartened mercenaries E Etruscan chief A Autharite Retreating army At the crevasse's exit turn left and bypass a hill on which stands a statue of Moloch a bigger replica of the one found in the room of the eye Around the hill you meet disheartened and injured mercenaries M
Speak to the Etruscan chief E who is standing in front of the idol
He explains that Hannon took advantage of Autharite's carelessness to attack the mercenaries
Defeated they abandoned their camp and sought refuge in the Solitude Mountains
Their morale is lower than it has ever been and they refuse to continue to fight
Only a spectacular wonder could draw them out of the stupor into which they have fallen
You will therefore destroy the eye of the idol that according to the Etruscan chief quot brings misfortune quot First make your way to the pond on the banks of which Autharite A is brooding over his defeat Take the empty pot in your inventory and fill it with water Returning to the temple Retrace your steps back to the secret passage leading to the Lost temple Climb the stairs up to the vaulted room
The idol is truly vast in fact the room you are in is located inside the idol Go to a in front of a hole in the wall
A red light cast by the eye of the statue shines at the bottom of the hole
This eye has the same characteristics as that which destroyed the waterworks Pour your water filled pot into the hole and quickly move as far away as you can
As soon as the water makes contact with the eye there is a tremendous explosion so great is it that the eye is propelled from the idol
Tactical exam Return to where the Etruscan chief is standing
Confirm that the mutilation of the statue is a positive omen quot It's a sign
The gods are with us
Gather the men and let's move forth quot Before agreeing to follow you the Etruscan chief wants to ensure that you are a good general He tests your knowledge through a series of questions that he asks you in a random order
Here they are along with the correct answers Question quot If your cavalry is greater than that of the enemy will you seek a battle on the plains or in rugged terrain quot Answer quot On the plains quot Q quot If the enemy camp is to the west and you've camped out to the east do you attack in the morning or wait until the afternoon quot A quot The morning quot Q quot If you're fighting with your back to the sea are you better off attacking at day's end or in the morning quot A quot At day's end quot Q quot You surprise the enemy in his camp in the middle of the night
You can either entirely circle him or leave him a way out
Which would you choose to do quot A quot I'd leave him a way out quot Q quot While sacrificing prior to the battle twelve birds of prey fly off to your right
What do you do quot A quot I attack with confidence quot Q quot Is a lunar eclipse a good or bad omen for an army that must flee quot A quot A good omen quot Kinematics After having successfully completed your quot tactical exam quot you take command of the mercenaries and advance on the Carthaginians
On the way you meet Narr rsquo Havas who is returning from checking on the supplies he is prodding a troop of pigs in front of him
He joins you along with his weapons and baggage just before the onset of the battle against Hannon
Battle against Hannon Your choice of order of battle will determine whether or not you are victorious Hannon's troops are already amassed at the top of the screen
Select your own units one by one and place them in front of the enemy following the diagram below PigsNumidian cavalry Heavy infantry Balearic rebels Begin the battle and relish your victory
Act Objective Expose the traitor Following your victory over Hannon the mercenaries take back their camp and lay siege to the city with war machines that M tho brought back Hamilcar who has been leading at Carthage since your troops captured Hannon has managed to corrupt Narr rsquo Havas
The danger is now coming from within your own camp
The Numidian chief plans to first assassinate you then openly defect and attack M tho It's up to you to make sure he fails Mercenary camp Doors to Carthage Moloch's finger M tho's tent Autharite's tent Potter's stall Wine merchant's stall Narr rsquo Havas' tent Pariahs' village Waterworks Backcountry road Helepole siege tower HelepoleAt Narr rsquo Havas' request M tho orders you to go to the top of the helepole and help the Numidian warriors adjust the aim of one of their war machines In front of the helepole a Numidian warrior greets you and gives you more specific information concerning your objective hit the banner hanging from the enemy ramparts with a burning arrow Climb to the top of the tower Click on the winch in front of you to hoist up a pail filled with arrows Take an armful of arrows from the pail Place these arrows in the rack beside the ballista type of giant crossbow
Click on the rack to take an arrow
Set this arrow on fire by touching it to the fiery coals burning in a bronze vase to your links then place the burning arrow on the ballista
You're ready to fire
a Fire control b Right rope c Left rope d Raise the ballista control e Tension of right rope control f Tension of left rope control g Dial indicating height h Dial indicating tension of right rope i Dial indicating tension of left rope Fire a test shot by clicking on a
The arrow misses the banner too high To adjust your aim you will need to change the settings of the ballista
Principle The height of the shot is largely adjusted with the command d then refined with e and f which control the tension of the ropes
This exercise is particularly difficult in that the tensions of each rope when modified must remain equal if not the projectile will deviate to one side or the other
To ensure that they are equal pluck each rope by clicking on b then c they should have the same note i e sound exactly alike
Solution The ballista is properly adjusted when the machine's dials are in the following position You now only need fire to hit the banner and set it on fire
This done go stand near the winch and observe what is happening below the Numidian warrior who greeted you is shirking behind the ladder ready to fire his weapon at your back if you were to descend
There's betrayal afloat
To thwart the trap that has been set click on the lever located behind the winch to send the pail of arrows to the ground
Use the rope tied to the pail to drop down in turn
Once on the ground stab the Numidian in the back
Narr rsquo Havas rsquo betrayal Leave the helepole to go to M tho's tent
The layout of the site requires that you pass near Narr rsquo Havas' tent
You have just been attacked by a Numidian and it would be safe to presume that he acted on orders from his chief hellip Be suspicious skirt Narr rsquo Havas' tent rather than pass in front of it
You overhear a conversation between the latter and a messenger sent by Carthage
Your suspicions are confirmed the Numidian chief is betraying the mercenaries
Go quickly warn M tho
As he seems to doubt what you are telling him add the following to convince him quot Hamilcar promised Narr'Havas Salammb 's hand in marriage in exchange for your head quot Then run over to Autharite's tent to alert him that the Numidian chief is now siding with the enemy Finally go to the Pariahs' village
You will have to convince them to side with the mercenaries in order to compensate for the loss caused by the Numidian defection The chief of the pariahs is hesitant
Tell him quot We can no longer wage this entire battle on our own
You must help us quot In exchange for his allegiance the chief demands food
Promise him the quot phenicopterus tongues quot found in Hannon's baggage The chief replies that he would rather eat Hannon himself
Set aside your scruples and promise that you will hand over the Carthaginian treasurer to him
The deal is thus struck
Return to M tho's tent
He gives the order to immediately attack Narr rsquo Havas
Kinematics Narr rsquo Havas is defeated but Hamilcar launches an attack on your army from Carthage using his best troops
Forced to flee you allow yourselves to be trapped in the Hatchet Mountain Pass
Hamilcar joined by Narr rsquo Havas who has rallied his troops blocks all the exits with rocks
He then sets up his camp on a hilltop thereby preventing M tho from coming to your aid
Act Objective Survive to be victorious You and your men are prisoners in the Hatchet Mountain Pass
You have to escape otherwise you will starve to death From having visited this site in Act you know that there is a way out the secret door in the hall of the Lost temple
Unfortunately the mechanism for opening the door no longer works a vandal has removed two cameos from the cartouche of the central pillar You must bull find the cameos so as to be able to open the secret door bull cross the Lost temple to exit at the point in the Solitude Mountains where Hamilcar has set up camp bull infiltrate the enemy camp and unleash a panic that will result in Hamilcar's defeat bull bring the mercenaries back to attack Carthage win over the last of the enemy's armies and take control of the city
The first two objectives must be reached as quickly as possible for you are slowly dying of thirst and or hunger

Any such food eaten will temporarily raise your life gauge Pass and Lost temple Entrance to the pass Ledge Insect nest Rocky spur Dragon rocks Lost temple The site has changed significantly since your last visit the entrance to the pass is closed off by rocks and the ground is littered with the dead and the dying
The Act begins with a conversation with Autharite in front of the entrance to the Lost temple The Gaul claims that you're responsible for all of the army's troubles states that the men have lost confidence in you and predicts that your end is near
Ignore these defeatist words and enter the hall of the temple
Talk to the chief of the Pariahs who is sitting in the back of the room He is the one who stole the cameos required to open the secret door
He sees these as precious objects quot beautiful things quot that have awakened his lust
He agrees to give them to you if you bring him fresh meat
Exit the hall and head towards the rocky spur have no fear of the dragon from Act he has long ago been killed and eaten by hungry men At grows a cactus that could save you from starving to death Use your dagger to gather the plant

Click at one of the images to go directly to that part of the walkthrough Or click at the image of Hannah and Sam at the bottom of this page to go to the next part
Important This walkthrough is about the dvd version of the game
If you play the cd version all mission logs are wiped
This won't effect the game play
You'll only miss some clues that some of the missing scientists have left behind in the mission logs
In the cd version you also don't have to solve a very tough puzzle the telescope puzzle
In that case just go on with the game
The Floating Island Hannah Look around and you'll see only one path between the two benches
So that makes things easy
Follow that path until Hannah arrives at the first platform and sends her coordinates to Sam
Keep walking straight ahead
When you arrive at the next platform you can go to the left and to the right
The path to the right is just leading into the ocean so that won't get you any further
Step on the path leading to the left
Go forward two times
Turn to the right and climb up the path
At the next platform Hannah sees some sort of strange optical effect
Turn to the right and climb up the path until you reach the next platform
Look around and you'll see some kind of fountain
At the right of the fountain you'll see three benches in the distance
Walk toward those benches
Turn to the right and zoom in on the table
Three benches in the distance You'll see a mission log lying on the table
Zoom in on the mission log and switch it on
It seems that there are two entries left
You'll get a serious message from one of the missing scientists Tomlin
His messages doesn't sound very good
Zoom out
Turn around and walk towards the building at the right of the fountain
Just walk into the elevator shaft to call the elevator
When you entered the elevator look around and push the up button
When you arrive upstairs turn around and exit the elevator near the green plant
Turn to the right and you'll see some sort of control panel
Walk towards the control panel
Don't use it yet
Just remember it's there
Turn to the left and walk towards the green plant near the elevator
Turn to the right and walk forward
Now Hannah wonders where all the people have gone
Turn to the right to see another elevator
Don't enter it yet just remember it's there also
Turn back to the left and walk forward to another path leading up
When you are standing in front of that path look to the footbridge at your right
Zoom in on the bridge and discover that the first parts of the bottom of the bridge are missing
Zoom out and turn to the left to climb up the path
When you arrive at the next level look around and you'll see lots of bees flying around
You can only go into one direction
So go into that direction
Zoom in on the strange pear shaped device
Note these signs You'll see a plank with strange signs in the device
Make a note of these signs and number them from top to bottom number up to and including number
Notice that the liquid inside the device is pointing to number
Zoom in on the little shelf at the right of the device
You'll see a blue bottle attached to the device and an image of a bee
Zoom out
Turn around and climb down the path to the previous level
When you arrive at the previous level go one time forward to the right side of the elevator
Turn to the left and enter the elevator
Look around and push the up button
Turn around and exit the elevator through the door with the bars
Look around and you'll see lots of bees again Look around and you'll see a little well filled with green water
Turn to the right and head into that direction At your right you'll see another suspension bridge and a path leading up to the right
The suspension bridge will take you all the way to the part of the suspension bridge with the missing parts
You're going to climb the path leading up to the later on
So ignore them for now
Just keep going straight ahead
Go around the building and you'll see a strange rock formation
At the left you'll see a pedestal with some kind of urn
When you push the lid three tentacles in the rock are moving
Pick up the urn
Turn around and walk to the next path leading up
Turn to the left and climb up the path until you reach the next level
Hannah will give some comment to Sam again
In the distance you'll see another bench with a mission log
Walk to the bench turn to the right and zoom in on the mission log
The messages of this log seem to be wiped
Zoom out and turn to the left
Walk to the next path leading up
Go all the way up
You get another close encounter with one of the missing scientists Tomlin
Turn to the right and walk towards the fountain
Turn to the right and zoom in on the tulips
The first tulip is empty for now
But you are going to change that
Zoom out turn around and walk to the spiral stairs
Climb the stairs until you reach an oblong control panel
Zoom in on the control panel
All the way down you see the row of tulips
On the control panel you'll see five circles
Number them from the left to the right as number and
In the very last tulip there's a wooden tablet with coordinates
Your goal is to move that tablet to the first tulip by pushing the correct circles
Push them in the next order and
You'll see the tablet being thrown from one to another tulip and finally it will land into the first tulip
Look at the tulips all the way down Zoom out turn to the right and climb the stairs all the way up
Turn to the right and zoom in on the wooden planks which are lying on the floor
You'll find a wooden tablet with the same kind of signs you have seen on the pear shaped device
The upper signs are crossed out with a red mark
I wonder if these are the old coordinates this scientist was speaking of
And if the ones which aren't crossed out may be the new coordinates
Make a note of these coordinates
The first tablet with coordinates Notice that there's one sign on the tablet that isn't on the plank in the pear shaped device
It's the sign marked by me
with the red arrow According to the other signs on the plank this one fits in best after the sixth sign from top on the plank so it should be number
Now re number the signs on the plank in the pear shaped device from number up to
Now translate the signs on this tablet into real numbers From the top to the bottom you'll find The old coordinates with the red cross and the new ones Now you may think So what
Well believe me you'll find out Zoom out turn around and climb down the stairs all the way
When you arrive downstairs you'll have another brief encounter with that scientist Tomlin
He's telling you that you're doing well
Walk passed the fountain and zoom in on the tulips again
Now you'll find the wooden tablet that was hidden in the last tulip
Make a note of these coordinates as well
The second tablet with coordinates Now translate the signs on this tablet as well into real numbers From the top to the bottom you'll find the old coordinates with the red cross and the new ones You'll need these two new coordinates in a few moments to set sail to a new destination
And not only that
In chapter four you have to calculate new coordinates yourself based on these ones Zoom out and walk down the path to the previous level
At that level find and climb down the path down to the previous level
At that level walk forward one time turn to the left and enter the elevator
Look around and push the down button
When it stops exit the elevator
Turn to the left and walk towards the other elevator the one next to green plant
Don't enter this elevator now
In stead of that turn to the left and walk to the control panel
Push the button to call the gondola
You'll get a free ride to another part of the structure
When the gondola has stopped turn to the right and walk towards the path leading up
Climb up the path
Zoom in on the rock formation
Doesn't that look familiar
Yep it looks exactly as the rocks where you picked up the urn
Zoom out and turn to the right
Climb up the path with the horn shaped rocks
Zoom in on the rocks and you'll see an empty pedestal with a kind of dial
Beneath the dial you'll see lots of marks
Place the urn on the pedestal
As you have seen before you can move the tentacles in the rocks by pushing the lid of the urn
Your goal is to get all the tentacles sticking out the rocks by moving the dial and pushing the lid
When all the tentacles are sticking out an electric force field will be created which you can walk to the other site of the rocks
Every time you moved the dial into the correct position you have to push the lid of the urn
Number the marks on the pedestal from the left to the right as number up to and including
This is the correct order to turn the dial and to push the lid of the urn every time after you moved the dial to the next mark and
Don't forget to push the lid every time after you move the dial Zoom out turn around and walk one step ahead
Turn to the right and walk toward the tentacles sticking out of the rocks
You'll be taken to the next part of the structure
Zoom in on the big stretched vine in front of you
Use the device that's hanging from the vine
This gives you another free ride
At the end of your ride look around
You'll see some kind of control panel but you can't reach it yet
Turn to the right and go down the path
Walk into the elevator and push the up button
Turn to the left and exit the elevator
Walk to the two big wheels you'll see in this room
Zoom in on the wheels and you'll see familiar signs
Your goal is to highlight the correct new coordinates on both wheels which will take you to another part of the structure
Because you don't have all signs to all coordinates you can use some dots instead of that signs
Just imagine the wheels as a big clock
Notice that there's an outer rim a second rim and an inner rim
Just like an ordinary clock you can divide the clock into hours the outer rim minutes the second rim and seconds the inner rim
The only difference to an ordinary clock is that one hour hasn't got minutes but only
This clock also hasn't got seconds but only
You'll need this knowledge further to calculate new coordinates A few moments ago you found out the new coordinates to use at this device this time
These were The first set of coordinates has to be used at the wheel to the left
The second set is for the wheel to the right
Zoom in on the left wheel
On the outer rim push the sign at o'clockon the second rim push the dot at o'clockon the inner rim push the dot at o'clock The correct sign and dots on the left wheel Zoom out and zoom in on the wheel at the right
On the outer rim push the sign at o'clockon the second rim push the dot at o'clockon the inner rim push the sign at o'clock The correct signs and dot on the right wheel Zoom out and zoom in on the hand sign between the two wheels
Push on the hand and you'll drift away
When the island has docked zoom out and enter the elevator once more
Push the down button
Exit the elevator
Climb up the path
Turn to the left and zoom in on the vine again
Use the device to be transported across the ocean
Important one person told me that the vine couldn't reach the island at this point
If that's the case see how to correct this problem by using thetelescope
Walk to the end of the footboard and enter the building
When you entered the building save your game and switch over to Sam by pushing on his image at the bottom of your screen

On the left look close at a set of tentacles directed at a central bud Forward to the main console
At the console there are big circles on both sides and a smaller one with a hand scanner in between
The big circles have familiar icons from the coordinate plaques and each are made up concentric circles
Now to translate them Coordinates puzzle Based on what the ghost scientist said there are old and new coordinates found on the plaques recovered
Looking at both plaques the icons with the red x mark must be the old coordinates and the bottom ones the new coordinates
The big circles have concentric circles with dot s beside the icons corresponds to the position of the circles So clockwise the markings are topmost
The existing lit up icons are from the new coordinates from the plaque from the top floor of the other island
Look close on the smaller center circle with the hand
Note the lit green button on the left denoting the existing coordinates entered which must be here the living ships area
The new coordinates to be entered then should be the one from the tablet recovered from the tulip Plaque showing existing coordinates Plaque showing coordinates to be enteredLeft circle with new coordinatesRight circle with new coordinates So clockwise the markings are topmost
The existing lit up icons are from the new coordinates from the plaque from the top floor of the other island
Look close on the smaller center circle with the hand

Go back inside to the middle area and look close at the apparatus on both sides
Press some handles and walk back to the other apparatus this will trigger the appearance of Dr Bremer's ghost and she tells you that one gas is x stronger than the rest unstable changes every time and to guess which pipe it is on Air Compressor puzzle This is a random puzzle
The object of the puzzle is to find the strong gas x stronger than the rest on both apparatus and pipe it in to the balloon ship outside
Look close at one of the apparatus there are gas handles a large pipe on the left side leading to the fish balloon and a small coiled one leading to a miniature balloon and meter
By clicking a handle gas is piped in
Then click on the center ball with a directional arrow and the gas is piped into the miniature balloon on the right side
The circle meter shows the strength of the gas
After pumping gas to small balloon click the determined strong gas handle to pump the gas to the fish balloon
The center directional arrow now faces the large pipe By mixing all the gasses together individualize each gas and then reading the meter the stronger gas can be identified
Individualize each gas by numbering them for ease gas is the one at o'clock position
Pump gas once gas twice and so on until gas x to the small balloon If all the gasses have a strength of one the meter should read
The outer and inner meter indicator is divisible by
The outer meter indicator is units at each indent
The inner meter indicator is one at each point
ex
outer meter is at x and inner meter is x therefore
After pumping all the gasses read the meter and subtract to that reading ex The result is the strong gas
Click strong gas handle ex to pump the gas to the fish balloon and see it rise
Do this procedure to the other compressor and the balloon ship rises once more and can now be accessible
By mixing all the gasses together individualize each gas and then reading the meter the stronger gas can be identified

The first move is done by Matia and it will try to build a continuous wall vertically and block your moves
It is a random puzzle and two wins in a row is necessary
Saving a game in between the wins is not possible
I did not find a fixed strategy for this puzzle The wins I got were a staggered path from top to bottom diagonal or start paths and concentrated on one and slowly build the other path while the other is being blocked by Matia When wins are accomplished the bridge is raised but upon riding the trolley will realize that it is only a part of the bridge and that another part has to be done yet This puzzle can be done later until after the metal door puzzle Move back turn forward left and go out to the other side of the cliff
Turn right forward x turn right and see another door
This one is locked
There might be another of the rail track puzzle here to raise the rest of the bridge to get through to the Giant bud
Have to look for more clues
Move back turn left and forward until the elevator Tunnel Both characters should go down the elevator to the st floor or lowest level
Here the elevator has exits one to the dam and the other to the village and tunnel
Take either Sam or Hannah to look around the tunnel and see a man imprisoned at the other side of the water
To the left is a mechanism that has squares something to do later
Get the other character still by the elevator to go to the other exit by the dam
See and hear water flowing off the dam turn left and see a water wheel click hold turn up on the left side of the wheel and note that the sound of the water falling off the dam is gone
Now click on picture of the character inside the tunnel
Walk across the now dry reservoir and talk to the man take note of what Dr Charles Santo says Thinking that there's a watch system Matia they tried to make it mad by taking things
Angela Davis calls the Wanderer based from old text treasure beyond price the old name is Good Servant and might have a doomsday function
Richard Hovis came here and said that the village of Matiani makes dimensional shifts and the key are the houses enter twice exit once
The Wanderer is on the other side of the dam
Hovis found the safety measures in unlocking the Wanderer but cautions not to
As for him unlock it Come back for me Promise Turn around and exit the tunnel
Matiani Sam and Hannah As Sam go to the pathway away from the tunnel to the raised drawbridge
Press the button on the stand and see that the bridge is uneven and barely move Hannah Go to the front of the tunnel
Turn the wheel to the right of the tunnel while facing the tunnel clockwise
Sam push the button and check the bridge Do this back and forth the two characters until the right bridge goes down even and back up again
Hannah go to the wheel to the left of the tunnel while facing the tunnel and turn the wheel clockwise
Sam push the button and check if the left side of the bridge is even to the right
Turn wheel one increment at a time when the bridge is close to being even
Do this cooperation between the two until the bridge is even
Sam Cross the bridge and see houses on the left and one on the right House puzzle Remember what Dr Santo said Hovis rambled about entering a house twice and leaving it once
Check each house on the left and see that you can go out of the same house the house on the right or out of another house
While exploring a man appears at the right house and gives a metal plate similar to the one Hannah has except with a different icon with a knob at the center
By trial and error the answer can be obtained
A flash seen by opening the right house resets the puzzle and that the right house doesn't matter to the house entry and exit count
Number the houses to the left Enter house Exit house right right right right Come out of the right house into the night
Walk towards the bridge and see a woman looking up to the left
She says the decision is yours the Wanderer or the Good Servant Didn't Dr Santo say that they're one and the same
Wanderer new name of Good Servant or this a choice between old and new future Look at what she's looking at
Look up to the left
It looks like the knobs on the top portion of the computer setup at Bosch Tunnel
Take note of sequence of which ones are raised out of the lights
From left to right Enter the right house and come out to daylight

Right L R Go back to the floating island and click the third lit button and then the hand scanner
Travel back to Matia's island
Matia's island Hannah and Sam Hannah Get off the floating island ride the trolley to the Wanderer
Go to the left house and raise the buttons from left to right
Then go to the right house and raise the buttons from left to right
Go to the raised platform area and press the button across from the coordinate panel
See the Wanderer open and close
Turn to the right and see a ghost that says So that is your decision
So be it
There is still time to save your friends
Get to the balloon
Matia will do what it must do Travel back to the tunnel where Dr Santo is
Sam Go to the fish balloonon the top floor behind the meshed gate
Enter the new coordinates taken from the panel at the islet
Press center button The fish balloonflies to the Wanderer pulls something out travels to the floating island and drops the round object there
Green smoke rises from a chimney on the floating island and the blue and pink material on the wings disappears Go to the wheel by the dam and stop the water flow again
Hannah Walk towards Dr Santo and he says You came back kept your word keeping faith is what matters you and your friend must stay together we can go now
He disappears
Bring Sam and Hannah to the floating island and up to the main console
When both Sam and Hannah are up by the main console a man appears and points to the tentacles directed to a bud
Look close and see a gold sun like object replaces the bud Click on it and explanations are given by Angela Davies

A CD ROM Commentary amp Walkthrough bySoren Andersen Commentary Following are some personal observations I have about this game it is to be hoped there are no mistakes contained therein nothing misinterpreted or missed
Schizm is a very good game with particularly stunning graphics interesting and clever action and a good interface
You can play it using only your mouse though there can be a tendency to overshoot when panning
You can use the left and right keyboard arrow keys in which case the turning is instantaneous rather than panning
The ability to adjust the background music is a plus as it the option to have spoken words printed though most not all of the character speak clearly
Inventory presents no problem because there are no more than two items there at any one time
Let's just say that it is an all around very good game but there are a couple of shortfalls worthy of note
Several of the characters have speeches of some length and there is no way to skip these once you have heard them or repeat them for content review
Adventure gamers are always urged to store often as they proceed through a game but in this game you are given only sixteen slots for storage by no means enough for a game of this length
Moreover there is no provision for a descriptive indication of the storage point only a thumbnail fairly large and an automatically applied time tag
It may be prudent to keep a cross reference list of the time tags and a description of the action
You may record over a previous store but this is no substitute for the provision of continuously saving at many points along the game
There is a way around this dearth of storage if you wish to go to the following small trouble
Find the folder where the saved games are stored Program Files
They are stored as files Schizm sNN where NN goes from to
Somewhere convenient open another folder say Savgam or Schizsav and under that create as many folders Set Set as you will need to save sets of saved games
You can then move sets in and out of the game folder as required
You can use the Alt Tab keys to switch between the game and Windows Explorer the latter being a convenient place to shuffle stored game sets by dragging them with the right mouse key
Take reasonable care when doing this
Should you go for this extra storage don't forget to be sure it is deleted when you uninstall the game
The distinction between the Wanderer and the Good Servant is not clear nor what are the features of each
Santo indicates that they are the same just older and newer names but an Argilan lady appearing in Matiana says Sam must choose between them
The opportunity to do this is not apparent What exactly is or is in that ball removed from what I assume is the Wanderer
As is frequently the case in Adventure games the ending has the feeling of being rather contrived as though the designers ran out of ideas and or ambition or money
and just decided to quickly wrap things up and quit and in so doing not everything is completely clear
One always has to expect and accept some things that ordinarily might not occur at least not without explanation
When the island ship arrives at a destination you move between the island ship and the destination on a chair probably better described as a seat transporter that is supported by what appears to be a large heavy beam
There is no indication of how this beam is withdrawn and extended when leaving and arriving at a new location
And the chair is always waiting no matter which end you approach
Trivial perhaps but curious When working the gas collector puzzle pressing a lever to release a unit of gas will inflate a small instrument balloon the same gas unit when sent to a large transportation balloon will increase its size a very appreciable amount
Just accept it
On the other hand I have a major problem with the surveying instrument setup once the triangle used for the Temple calculations is accepted the mathematics is correct but I can't reconcile how the physical setup is represented by the triangles
Among other things the location of the measuring instrument in the triangle base is out of place
There is much traveling back and forth between sites in this game and also within the temple
As a possible help in keeping track of where you are a couple diagrams have been provided although they are included at the end of the walkthrough diagrams and screenshots these are by no means spoilers they are just intended as aids however successful they may or may not be as such
As stated in the accompanying walkthrough it is for the CD version of the game unfortunately not the DVD version that was unavailable to me
In it note that the terms Bosh and Bosh Tunnels are used interchangeably as are Matia Matia Island and Matia Zone and also Living Ships and Island Ships pretty much following game usage
Answers to puzzles are sometimes provided in the text sometimes separately but they are there where non variable solutions are possible
You must make notes where indicated
Soren Andersen Dec WALKTHROUGH It is important to note here at the outset that this walkthrough is for the CD ROM version of Schizm which is less intricate and has less puzzles than the DVD version
For example you can find mission logs lying about in the DVD version they have messages on them but in this CD ROM walkthrough some of them are blank in which case you are not directed to them
The game begins with a series of briefing statements outlining the story line situation that is covered in more detail on pages of the jewel case game booklet which of course you should carefully read
Really you should
You will be playing Schizm alternately as either Hanna Grant or Sam Mainey switching between the two using the portrait icons at screen lower right
Schizm is a linear game in which puzzles must be completed for action to proceed
This walkthrough describes one path of how Sam and Hanna do this but in fact either of them in many situations could be the one to provide the solutions
This is particularly the case in the latter part of the game where they are in the same location and are working together
Cases in point are the railroad puzzles and the houses puzzle in Matia or the cooperative bridge puzzle
You begin playing as Hanna who is separated from and out of communication with Sam and is on some sort of island or group of them which the Map of Argilus in the game booklet calls Living Ships
They appear to be deserted but everything is in working order
There are several floors to this island each not very extensive in area all but the first two of them richly detailed
You move between them by means of ramps and elevators and it pays to keep track of them and on which one you are operating
From this bare first floor at the surface of the sea there is only one place to go up a ramp to the second floor
Upon arriving you see a mysterious optical effect that is a brief flash of bright light
Again nothing to do here but take the ramp that goes up to the third floor
Upon arrival there will be two forward cursors spaced close together take the left one which will bring you to an elevator the right one leads to a blank mission log
Enter the elevator and click on the control to go up to the fourth floor
When you exit you will be facing a second elevator though not the entrance to it to the right of which is a call button for a gondola transporter to another island this is for later don't press the button at this time or you will be taken to this other island and will just have to come back
For now move to the left around the second elevator where there is another ramp and a suspension bridge to another island
A closeup of the bridge shows it to be useless because it is missing many of its floorboards
Now there is a chance for some confusion because both the ramp and the second elevator go up but to different floors two fifth floors
Start with the ramp because it goes to a floor with no other access call it floor five R
Here you encounter some bees ignore them
To the right is a pear shaped container almost filled with a liquid
When you get to it click the magnifying cursor to the right of it to see what is behind it a picture of a bee and also a blue bottle connected to the container
Back off then click the cursor on the container to get a closeup of the vertical scale within it
This scale must be used to measure liquid level and as such it will be a progressive series of numbers
Examine it starting at the top the first number is since there the container would be full then there are numbers in groups of three the first group vertical marks as in Roman numerals then these are repeated with a bar across the top then repeated again with bars across top and bottom bringing the numbers to
The tenth digit is a horizontal mark and the eleventh two horizontal marks
As will be seen later is three horizontal marks
However with this groups of three system the digit representing is missing from the scale making the scale erroneous so it will be added giving the corrected set of numbers as shown in Fig

This addition is for number system illustration clearly it cannot be added to the scale inside the container
Turn about and go back down the ramp to the fourth floor and the second elevator next to the unusable bridge
Take the elevator up to the next floor call it five E More bees and a green pool
To the right is another suspension bridge also missing flooring
Go past the bridge past an ascending ramp and around the corner
Here on a pedestal is what appears to be a lantern click the plunger on the top to make three carrot like spikes in the wall go in and out
That's all they do in and out
Use your grabber cursor to put the lantern into inventory where it appears even more to be one because it is illuminated
Go back to the ramp you just passed and use it to go up to floor six
Again two forward cursors close together and again take the left one to a ramp leading to floor seven
The right one again goes to a blank mission log
Go up the ramp to another optical effect but this time within it is one of the missing scientists
He gives you fragmentary messages Find the plaques
They were deliberately scattered so we couldn't get back to Bosh navigational coordinates for operating the living ships but they change all the time
Old ones won't work now new ones the new coordinates
Please help us
We're trapped in Look around this floor
Objects of interest are several large black tulips growing out over the edge of the floor
Approach the tulips and when they are all in a line you can click on the nearest one to have a look inside it however there is nothing in it but what you might expect in such a flower
Now you must go up one more time this time on a long circular stairway that you can find behind the fountain
Go all the way to the top on the way passing a panel of five dials
At the top you will find one of the headstone shaped plaques about which the trapped scientist spoke
It is at the bottom of the screen
This is probably plaque as there is a vertical mark in a circle at the top
It is reproduced in Fig
more about it later
Return down the steps to panel of five dials and get a closeup of it
You can see the row of tulips down below
Press one of the dials improbable as it may seem something is tossed from one tulip to another
Press another dial whatever it is is tossed to another tulip
Play like this for a while it is fun to do it resets when you have pressed all five dials or if you back off
The object is to get the thing tossed into the first tulip the one that you can look into
The dial sequence to do this is
Go down to see what the thing is that is in the tulip it is plaque also shown in Fig

It is time to return to the fourth floor the one where the two elevators meet and around to the gondola transporter terminal that you saw when leaving the first elevator
Push the button to summon the gondola which takes you to another island and deposits you next to what looks like an elevator but if it is you can't get into it
You can however take a ramp up to another floor where if you use your magnifying cursor you can see a wall with a row of about a dozen of those carrot like spikes
To the right between a couple torches is another ramp to walk up and behind the three curlicues is another pedestal
It is pretty obvious that you are to take the lantern from inventory and put it on the pedestal
There are marks on the edge of the pedestal one for each of the spikes in that row of them and a pointer indicating the rightmost mark
You are to turn the lantern to a mark push down the plunger on top of it in order to move some spikes in and out and repeat until all the spikes are extended
Inasmuch as spike movements are interconnected and each lantern pointer position provides two sets of spike extensions this is next to impossible to figure out but if you wish to give it a try here is a hint after you move the pointer to a starting position the movement of the pointer is progressive in one direction there is no moving back and forth
Another hint there are nine pointer positions needed
Removing the lantern resets the pointer but it doesn't reset the spikes moving back to the other side of the curlicues and then forward to the lantern again will make a complete reset and give you a fresh start for another attempt
Success in this endeavor is evidenced by brief electrical discharges appearing between the fully extended set of spikes
The correct sequence is shown in Fig

With all spikes extended you can walk across them then across a second spike set to arrive at another transporter this one using a chair rather than a gondola
The chair is folded up against the bottom of the transporter beam click on it for a closeup click on it again and it unfolds and off you go to be deposited on another island
This is the island ship to which Sam and Hanna will go and come many times
Other than go back all you can do is go down a ramp then up an elevator
When you get off the elevator you can examine something to the left that looks like a carnivorous plant or perhaps an anenome but there is nothing to be found in its center
Later more than likely
From here you move down to some consoles of which only the group of three on the left is accessible
Now is the time to consider those two plaques in Fig

Each has two sets of positional coordinates and on each the top set is crossed out so they may be ignored presumably they are the old ones mentioned by the trapped scientist and the lower sets are the new ones
Traditionally geographic position is given by latitude and longitude expressed in degrees minutes and seconds and this is what the Argilan number sets on the plaques represent
A line with the first symbol that looks like the Greek letter phi with a line across the stem will be latitude and the symbol that resembles the numeral also with a line across it will be longitude
Of the three Argilus numbering symbols following these latitude and longitude symbols the first is followed by a dot the second by two dots and the third by three dots and thus degrees minutes and seconds are designated
If you get a closeup on the center of the three consoles you will see an open hand icon and a single lit green indicator
Pressing the hand results in nothing but a brief faint flash and hum
Get a closeup of the left console and examine it in the center is the latitude symbol the outer ring of Argilus numbers each has a dot for degrees the next ring has two dots for minutes and the inner ring three dots for seconds
Note from this console that the Argilus system has minutes per degree and seconds per minute
The numbers that are illuminated are those for the new latitude of plaque a closeup of the longitude console on the right with the longitude symbol in the center shows illuminated numbers for plaque new longitude
The next move is pretty clear set the latitude and longitude of plaque into the left and right consoles
Having done this click on the hand icon for a video of the island sailing away
A second light on the hand console lights up and you have presumably arrived at Bosh
Return to the elevator take it down to the ramp and up the ramp to the chair transporter
Somehow the far end of the large transporter beam has now become attached to the new location Bosh so get in the chair and take off
At the end of the ride go along the suspended walkway and through the tunnel into a cavernous space with much scaffolding
This place is really big and pretty dark
The Bosh Tunnels
Go forward a couple times and you will be next to a large statue of a shrouded seated figure with a beam of light projecting from its head
You can climb a couple of ladders to get closer to the top of the statue where you will see a metal ring attached to its face
On the way down the ladders you will see the beam is illuminating a tablet on the floor
Going to this tablet shows an oval with a new symbol at the top and blank spaces for latitude and longitude
Go back a step toward the entrance tunnel and turn right to head along a corridor
One step along the corridor and another optical effect may occur this one containing a young woman who says something in a foreign tongue then hands you an article that automatically goes into inventory where it appears to be a flat rectangular object with a red symbol on it
Continue along the corridor as far as you can where on the left you will come upon a stone structure with wooden stairs going up the right side
On top of the structure is a console that has in several ways the appearance of a parlor organ though there is no conventional keyboard
Perhaps it is some sort of computer
You can play around with it but there is no indication of exactly what to do
You can have Hannah look all around this place but there seems to be nothing else for her to find or do
It is time to see what Sam is up to so click on his image at lower right
Sam's pod came down on balloon that is one of a vast field of these giant devices many of which resemble jellyfish
They are floating several thousand feet above the surface of Argilus all devoid of people as were Hannah's islands
He finds that he cannot make contact with her
Immediately look down at a compass on the deck in which the cardinal and ordinal positions are indicated by eight unfamiliar symbols
The pointer swings to one of them
Note this symbol or its equivalent standard direction
Turn right toward a large daisy like device with reversed petals or perhaps eight light bulbs in a circle to be seen in the building to the left of which is a video mission log on a stand click on the latter for a warning from one of the missing scientists
Leave the daisy for the moment and move down the corridor and through the tunnel watching all the time for more compasses on the floor near the edge of the platform
You will pass another gondola transporter a more elaborate enclosed one this time don't get in it on your way to finding the fifth and last compass of a series
On each of the five compasses you have to note the direction indicated by the pointer these positions change for each new game
Turn right from the last compass to another video mission log click on it for a message from a scientist Dr Frances Bremmer
Return back down the corridor to the daisy and click the five petals with the symbols indicated by the compass pointers in the order that you found them
When you have done this the center disk will open to collect nine small blue spheres for you to place in inventory
Turns out they are pearls
Each of the directions has a spoken word in the Argilan language and pressing the yellow petals allows you to hear them
In Fig
is an attempt of questionable success to reproduce these names phonetically
Unfortunately as spoken they are none too clear and there is some interfering background noise
It may well be that there are not any English letters or combinations thereof that truly represents an Argilan sound
You may wish to make your own interpretation
Return to the gondola transporter
Enter it click on the dashboard arrow and enjoy the ride to another balloon
Many of the balloons have a curious resemblance to jellyfish
When you disembark find a disk on a pedestal that shows heretofore unencountered symbols arranged in the outermost of several concentric circles as shown in Fig

You will need to refer to this in a little while
Follow the walkway into the structure all the way through to the platform at the other end
Turn left go the edge and look down to see an ornate balloon that rather resembles a fish this more clearly later
It appears to be steaming
You have to raise this balloon so that you can gain access to it
Go back into the structure to the center where there is a short cross walkway with an elaborate circular apparatus on each end
These are identical and the only way to distinguish between them is that one has steam escaping next to it from below
Get closer and examine this unit then go to the one opposite
Another optical effect occurs in which Dr Bremmer appears with a message one gas can be used two times stronger than the other gasses in the collector that gets it from the atmosphere
The collector is unstable so you can't know which pipe carries the correct gas measure lifting power
Just one try because the pattern changes each time
I wish I could The circular devices opposite each other are the gas collectors cited by Dr Bremmer and from the message fragments you may gather that you need to select a particular gas that is twice as buoyant as the other that is available and you must do this in just one attempt
Save your game here so that you can investigate these collectors to see how they operate after which you can then start anew for your one attempt to find the buoyant gas in each
When you get close to a generator you will see handles that release gasses when depressed all but one of the same buoyancy
In the center of the device is a bidirectional valve with an arrow that indicates the direction of gas flow and can be observed turning to point to the right as you initially approach the collector
Though you have no way of knowing it the larger pipe to the left of this valve leads to the fish balloon to the right the gas goes through a smaller coiled pipe to a small balloon next to a round gauge that measures buoyancy by the lift movement of the balloon
The gauge has two indicators a black outer one at units per division and an inner vernier at unit per division
Try it out press one of the collector handles then press the center valve
The gas goes to the right to the rising balloon which moves the center gauge indicator division
Turn back to the collector where the center valve now points to the left
The only way to turn it back to the right is to push on one of the handles sending gas to the fish balloon there is a brief video of this balloon from a distance in which the fish inflates somewhat then deflates again assuming that you have not by chance used the handle controlling the more buoyant gas
Try this sequence some more counting the times that you press a handle then press the center valve to get a buoyancy reading
If you press more than times the outer gauge indicator will move as well as the inner one
Now you are ready to determine which of the handles controls the extra buoyant gas
Since you've messed with the collector and Dr Bremmer said in effect that you could not do that restore your game
Select a reference handle any one will do as long as you note which one
Press that one once then move to the next handle either way and press that one twice the next one three times and so on one by one around to the tenth pressing that one ten times
Press the center valve sending the collected gas to the small balloon by the meter
If all the gasses had the same buoyancy the meter would read the number of times that you pressed handles but since one gas has a buoyancy twice that of the others the value will be higher than that
Subtract from the reading you get and you will know which handle controls the extra buoyant gas
Work it out
Turn back to the collector where the center valve now points to the left
Press the handle that you have determined controls the extra buoyant gas and if you have made the correct determination you will see the fish balloon inflate and rise half way
Now go to the other collector and repeat the process in order to bring the fish balloon the rest of the way up to the platform where you will see it become attached
The mouth opens so that you can enter the balloon
Go to the end platform and do that
Go up the steps into the fish where you will find that you cannot proceed further into the fish body
About face and go into the head
On both sides are sets of controls the ones on the left being unlit and inoperative
There is however on the seat a CD that you can place in inventory
Go across the aisle to another set of controls these with illuminated sets of symbols and handles that may be turned
Examine the symbols you should recognize them as those on the disk you saw right after you got to this balloon on the gondola transporter
Therefor the thing to do is to go now to that disk shown in Fig

When you get a closeup of the disk the cursor indicates the use of an inventory item which is of course the CD
Click the cursor and the CD goes to the disk
There are symbols in a radial row at the right of the CD click on the first of them the CD spins and a symbol is highlighted in the upper and in the lower arcs of symbols
Make a note of this set then repeat for the other of the radial symbols so that you have a listing of sets of symbols
Return to the fish balloon and to the right side controls in its head
It is pretty clear how to set the controls from your just noted symbol sets but you might want to save your game here in case you err
Set the left handle with the first of the three radial symbols the indicator on the arc of symbols above the handles to the symbol from the upper arc on the disk and move the right handle so the symbol from the disk lower arc is at the pointer
Do the same for the other two radial symbols on the left handle then press the button that is on the control post between the handles and take pleasure from the flight of the fish balloon to the Bosh Tunnels where it automatically docks at a mooring station
Leave the balloon Sam goes to the end of a walkway where he is now able to contact Hannah since they are both in the same location
He then starts to explore
Look down then go down the steps
Walk around the base of the mooring dock to a catwalk that leads into a domed gray unit that turns out to be an elevator
In the elevator pull the handle at top left to descend then go out the opening in front of you
Proceed along the long walkway to a large ledge in the rock and up to a lumped cloverleaf gate it is partly open but you can't get through
Go the left where there is another of these gates get a closeup of the gold colored pipe on the right and press the button
The gate opens
Go through this gate to a scene of many rocky islets in a sea of mist and covered with many interesting structures
Ahead you can see in the distance bridges and stairs where you will be going
Just keep moving forward across another walkway to a rock plateau onward over the bridges and up the long wide stairway where you will be in a small plaza looking at a large dark square tunnel with a monorail going into it
More exploring is indicated
Turn right and step forward
You will see a large yellow T shaped symbol on a stone wall turn right again and move to a catwalk leading out over the abyss to a platform containing a greenish domed shape
You will want to experiment with this instrument to see what may be learned about it
Click your magnifying cursor on the dome in order to climb into the attached seat
You will find that the whole unit may be rotated so that it is looking alternately at five different posts one of which is illustrated in Fig
D and also at the T shaped symbol on the stone wall
Look down and click on the handle to open the dome
A sight with red index pointers pops up Fig
B that may be dragged upward in seven discrete increments
Training the indices on the tops of the poles will give an angular measurement of their heights
Below this is a vertical scale Fig
C that introduces a new set of Argilan numerals not too easy to read
The numerals on the dial of Fig
A are of course the same as those in Fig
B but are compressed so that they are much harder to read though it can be done with concentration for instance the numeral for is relatively easy to pick out and you can count in both directions from that
Though there is no indication of its function a crafty inference will lead you to the fact that this unit is also used to measure distance to the poles
The units atop of the posts look as though they might have a mirror for laser reflection or the units might have transponders
Train the instrument on a pole press the button to set the dial to the zero reference then press the button to get the dial to register a distance reading for that pole
You can build a table of angular heights and linear distances for the five poles
The two dumbbell shaped symbols of Fig
A and C undoubtedly have some significance
The application of the table of measurements from this instrument will likely be revealed soon but now go back to the tunnel entrance with the monorail going into it
Turn left and step across the monorail
Sam says the scene ahead is the Science Base but there is no access he thinks it has been deliberately cut off
Turn left move ahead and turn about to see a pillar with a control lever mounted on it
Click on the lever and a monorail car comes rolling up extending a seat and controls
Approach the car to get in the seat then lift the only control lever that is not broken and you will be off on a noisy ride over the abyss and into a tunnel on the far side
When the monorail lets you off move ahead into the darkness and you will come out in a room where there is a circle of eight of what Sam calls prayer grinders large gold colored pillars each with its own unique shape and surface pattern
They are mounted on wooden stands with different colored displays in the face of the stands below the grinders
By dragging these display panels up or down with your mouse each of them may be individually rotated to the eight different patterns that are shown
If you click on a grinder it rotates and a double utterance is heard from the horn behind it
Upon playing with grinder and panel combinations you will find that the first part of the sounds are characteristic of the grinder and the second part is characteristic of the particular panel that is displayed
Fig
shows these eight grinders and panel pairs as they appear when you first move into the room each identified by the panel color surrounding its center disk
Below each is an attempted phonetic rendition of the utterance pairs unfortunately the speech pacing and word accenting cannot be indicated by simple spelling
As with the balloon field compass directions you may wish to provide your own
You can't do anything here other than observe and listen so go back to the monorail climb aboard and lower the control lever to return to the rock plaza and continue exploring
After you are put off the railcar return once more to the tunnel with the monorail and this time go through it
You have now entered the temple
This is a two tiered colonnaded set of corridors around a large rectangular pool with a statue at one end
Turn left and proceed along the corridor next to the pool
You will soon see recessed in the wall on the left a set of the prayer grinders in a closeup you will find that they rotate with only a faint sound if any at all and dragging on any of the display panels moves them all at once instead of individually
Continue along the corridor to a crossing where the only way to proceed is to turn right and go up some stairs to the second tier
From here turn left and go down steps into a room in which there is a poster of an oriental man
In front of it on a stone tablet is an etching of a bee the same as Hannah saw behind the pear shaped container on the floating island and looking upper left another etching in which the significant element is the Floating Island symbol for the numeral to be seen in the center
Go back to the upper tier corridor turn left and proceed down the steps
At the bottom the only way you can go is to the right and continue around the pool where you again find on the left a second set of grinders such as the first ones you saw
Keep going beside the pool and you will shortly see a curving stairway on the left
Go up these stairs and when you stop turn right twice so that you can get off the stairs then go ahead to the edge of the upper tier next to the pool
So far you have been going cw around the pool now go ccw
You will very soon come to a dark room on the right enter this room
On the right wall is a drawing of a man looking at a device that could only be the one on the pedestal in the abyss particularly as there is one of the posts to be seen on the right
Above his head is a diagram of an eyeball sighting along a couple of congruent right triangles Fig
in which are the dumbbell shaped symbols of Fig

On the opposite side of this room are a group of five meters Fig
similar to the one in Fig
A with miniature post replicas aligned behind each meter
On the wall is a another T shaped diagram this one with a dotted circle
If the wall diagram of Fig
is to be believed and there is some doubt about that spatially the congruency allows the simple proportion of Fig

You want to solve the proportionality for the numerator of the right side as indicated by the wall symbol in Fig
this presumably is the post height in linear units above the measuring device
From Fig
C the dumbbell shape with solid ends has a value of
Call the T shape numerator on the left of the Fig
proportion h the value that you get from reading Fig
B for each post for which the corresponding distance measurement is represented by the dumbbell shape with the dotted ends Fig
A call that d Finally call the symbol in the Fig
right hand numerator H the value you that you wish to calculate
Thus from Fig
H h d and you can complete your table of measurements Fig

Call the post next to the yellow wall symbol and go cw to
Finally you must by carefully dragging the meter dials of Fig
enter the five values that you have calculated for post height H The meter on the left corresponds to post
Success in this picky endeavor will be signified by a drawer below the meters popping open and which contains a disk for you to place in your inventory where it turns green
Leave this room beyond which are couple things significant for the DVD game version and return down the stairway to the first tier
Turn left and continue your cw passage around the pool where you will see a third and fourth grinder set
At the latter turn to the pool and a walkway beneath a fallen beam leading out across the surface of the water in front of the statue
Move forward once and you will get a good view of the statue
It will be a good idea to save your game at this point so that you can repeat a subsequent passage
Move past the statue whereupon your view will swing toward it and a priest will appear behind it with a message then disappear under a lotus petal that rises in back of the statue
This message is what you will in all likelihood wish to repeat from the game you just saved
You have heard before the six words that the priest says it was in the room with the eight prayer grinders
Look at Fig
as you listen to him speaking and you should be able to pick out the grinders and display panels to which he refers
His message is hoong huntu oorgi yema han foona
These words alternately designate grinders and panels and they thus form three pairs
Continue along the walkway into the building turn right and move ahead to see the fifth grinder set
Had you been looking closely you would have observed that the grinders in the first four sets are all lined up in the same order but the order of these in the fifth set is different
It must be that this fifth set is special
Again referring to Fig
you can see that the pairs in the set before you are hoong grinder is in the row and the huntu color is black the oorgi grinder is in the row and the yema color is white the han grinder is in the row and the foona color is green
Drag a panel so that any one of pairings is met and the others will also be correctly paired
Now click on the grinders in the above order and the priest's pronouncement is again heard
A short video shows the lotus leaf behind the statue rising just as it did for him when he pronounced the six words
Back off from the grinders turn left and move forward
You will end up behind the statue where under the raised leaf you will see a stairway leading downward
Go down these stairs and you will be hurried along to end up in the Bosh Tunnels at the stone structure holding the organ computer where Hannah was left
She and Sam are in communication they confirm that they are in the same place and though they can communicate they cannot see each other which Sam attributes to alien interference
He says they should continue exploring
Turn left and go as far as you can turn left again and move to the seated statue
Climb the ladders and put the green disk from inventory in the bracket in front of the statue's face then go back down and over to the previously blank tablet where the green disk has caused values for latitude and longitude to appear
Probably better make note of them
Sam's stated intention to explore does not confine him to the Bosh Tunnels
Turn left from the plaque in front of the statue and in the distance you can see the tunnel through which Hannah entered this place
Have Sam retrace her steps out cross to the island ship on the chair transporter and go to the travel control console
Bring up the central hand icon console and click on the first green button so as to recall the coordinates of the Living Ships where Hannah's pod put her down then press the hand icon to go there
It must be a long trip because the island ship leaves in daylight but arrives at night
Take the elevator down the ramp up and the chair transporter across to the island
Move along the extended spikes and down the ramp to the gondola terminal
Take the gondola across to the game's original island
As you approach notice the two elevators the first on the left going down the second on the right going up
Walk around the second elevator and to the ramp that goes up to the floor with the pear shaped container of liquid
As you step off the ramp a door opens and a man steps out with some rather enigmatic things to say to you and these are Some of us finally learned your language
Matia tried to prevent it for so long
And those of us who have made it back from sanctuary have been imprisoned again
I can only appear here in the middle of nowhere
Matia has well lost its way
Sees us as contaminated too
If it isn't done correctly now the Good Servant will simply complete what it has begun
There will be no Wanderer
No chance
I am to offer you precious oil in return for pearls
One unit of oil for one pearl
You will use the balance to measure the exact number you require then you will take it to the temple
He retreats back through the door
The liquid in the pear shaped container to the right must be oil
The scale must be or be part of the balance
Get a closeup of the container and click on the scale the marker at the top of the scale will slide down to and go back up gurglings are heard though there is no change in the oil level and the blue pearls disappear from inventory
Look behind the container and pick up the blue bottle
Well the man said to take it to the temple the picture of the bee next to the bottle indicating your destination to be the room in which you saw this same etching of the bee
By this time you should know the way back the second green button by the hand icon on the center travel control console recalls the Bosh coordinates
When the living ship takes you there go to the stairs under the pool statue up and all the way around the pool to the other end of the temple and the room with the poster of the oriental man
A priest appears and he seems unhappy
By his gestures you are short one unit of oil
But you had only nine pearls and the scale marker moved down to did the missing digit on the scale have anything to do with this
Perhaps you can get an explanation from the man who gave you the instructions to exchange the pearls for oil
Go back and talk to him and take Hannah along for support and possible assistance
Though you cannot see each other you can communicate assume she agrees
The alternation between Sam and Hannah to do this is up to you following is one way
Leave the room with the oriental poster go back below the temple to the Bosh Tunnels and out to the chair transporter
Take the chair over to the island ship and go down the ramp up the elevator and down to the coordinate consoles
Switch to Hannah who is in the Bosh Tunnels and have her go to the chair transporter where somehow the chair is waiting even though Sam just took it across
Send her across on the chair and have her wait when she gets off the chair
Switch to Sam and push the upper green button on the hand icon console to set the coordinates for the Living Ships press the hand icon and you're off
When you arrive go back to the chair transporter where Hannah is invisibly waiting
Take the transporter across the water go along the extended spikes to the gondola terminal and use the gondola to cross to the floor where the two elevators meet
Switch to Hannah and have her make the same short trip
Now you both are where the two elevators have terminals as does the gondola
As Sam go up the ramp to the oil container floor
The man comes out again with a couple comments No accusations
Good
You grasp how it is
Now go to the elevator
The pearl is there
Some confusion as to whether one of the nine pearls was removed there were nine when the exchange was made or whether in fact ten units of oil were required
No matter go to the second elevator and look at the base
Sure enough there is the pearl wedged in so you can't get it
Not to worry have Hannah take the elevator up and you can then put the pearl in inventory
Go to the oil container replace the blue bottle to the connection behind it click the pearl on the scale to get one more unit of oil and retrieve the bottle
Go back to the door and the man comes out again and says We have been forced to be a careful people too
Matia has always required it of us and now more than ever
You are learning that we value how as much as what
There may be time
You'll need the balloon
The Good Servant may yet be convinced to stay its hand if you choose right This time he disappears in an optical effect rather than going back through the door
Have both Sam and Hannah travel the familiar path back to the control panel on the island ship
Sam has to take the oil back to the priest so have him press the lower green button on the hand icon panel then press the hand to go to Bosh
Upon arrival take the chair transporter to the Bosh Tunnels beneath the temple up the steps to the temple and around to the Chinese poster room where the priest is
Now he is satisfied with the oil he takes the bottle and gives Sam a CD which looks the same as the one he used to get symbols to sail the fish balloon to Bosh
So it appears Sam will have to get back to the balloon field to use this CD
When the priest fades away leave the room and turn right go down the stairs and turn left and go along the corridor to the temple entrance
Leave the temple and go down the stairway and over the arched bridges
When you come to the second one Angela Davies appears fading in and out as she delivers the following message longer I can get through like this
I'm convinced these anomalies have their source in Matia's zone
You must go there
It's crucial for all of us that you try
new coordinates for getting there
You've probably seen how everything is so ritualized here by now like prayer grinders for opening gates
Hormat's Pillars and the model in the temple were used for such ritual calculations and it may even be the key to the Heavens I've been reading about possible to get off this world after all
But remember that they haven't been adjusted recently be used to retrieve navigational coordinates
So measure them and see what you can get
You must go to Matia's zone
There
Then Dr Hovis appears and says you should not listen to her that Matia can impersonate anyone and not to trust anyone
Sam wonders about the name Matia that he keeps hearing
So keep moving ahead through the tunnel and out across the long runway to the elevator
After you exit the tunnel be sure and close the lumpy cloverleaf doors
Go up the elevator and around the mooring platform and into the fish balloon
Sit in the driver's chair
Just as with the island ship controls this balloon has buttons for recalling destination instructions in this case a series of five buttons at lower left
Two are illuminated press the leftmost then the center button between the handlebars on the control post and you will return to the gas collector balloon
Exit and go through the latter to the disk on the pedestal onto which you should put the CD from the priest
Get the three sets of symbols as you did before by spinning the CD and note them so they may be entered in the fish balloon controls which you should now do just as you did previously
Now there is a third lit button in the array at lower left
Assuming that you have done all this correctly the balloon takes off on an overnight trip to a new destination
As you approach it you can see turrets on each side of a U shaped notch in a sheer cliff and in the center of the notch an elevator running down the face of the cliff
The fish balloon anchors at the top of the elevator
Leave the balloon
You will come immediately to a gate but it is not locked
Look to the right to see a cabinet and on an arch to the left of the cabinet an almost invisible key
Turn the key and the cabinet doors open to display the set of symbols used to get the fish balloon to this place
It's a good thing that you don't need them inasmuch as they are indistinguishable
Turn the key again to close the cabinet doors and the key goes into inventory
Turn back to the gate open it and enter the elevator
The control is on a post in the center of the elevator
This is the first elevator encountered with stops at more that two floors
It has four and you access them by raising and lowering the control rod at the top of the post
The top elevator stop where you now are is only the balloon anchor the other stops take you to some off limits residences to a walkway attached to the face of the cliff and a dam rust abounds to a tunnel dam overlook and a drawbridge
You can explore all this if you wish it really might be a good idea by way of locale familiarization and it is indeed interesting but it does not seem to lead anywhere though on the third level from the top you travel along a walkway fastened to the cliff and the dam until you come to some railway tracks
Hannah might be able to turn up something
Go back to the elevator and switch to her
Hannah is at the control console of the island ship which is at Bosh
You could have her go and get the coordinates on the plaque in front of the statue but assume Sam has given them to her
Enter them in the left and right controls and press the hand
Nothing happens
Well Angela Davies fragmentary message about Matia's Zone included new coordinates for getting there and remember that they haven't been adjusted recently recalling also that the two coordinate tablets found had two sets of coordinates one old and one new it is likely that those on this tablet are old ones and must be converted to new ones
Check the previous tablets to see if there is any consistency in those conversions
The decimal values of the Argilan digits in the coordinate readings that follow come from the scale shown in Fig
Tablet I Tablet II Old Lat deg ' deg ' Lon deg ' deg ' New Lat deg ' deg ' Lon deg ' deg ' Diff Lat deg deg ' Lon deg deg ' So there is indeed a consistency in the changes between the old and new coordinates a correction of ' in latitude and ' in longitude no change in degrees
Apply these corrections to the presumed old coordinates of the plaque in front of the statue Lat deg ' old Adding the latitude correction of ' gives deg ' but in the Argilan system of in ' unlike the Earth system of in ' is ' which converts the new latitude reading to Lat deg ' new Now for longitude the reading from the plaque in front of the statue Lon deg ' old ' on the longitude dial is the same position as ' see note so the longitude reading is ordm '
Adding the longitude correction of ' gives deg ' again is ' resulting in the new longitude Lon deg ' new Note while the above calculations result in a value of deg for the new longitude value in point of fact it should be ordm because when making the equivalency of ' to ' you are increasing the reading by ordm i e ' ordm
However if you enter ordm for the new longitude value it won't work the island ship will not move
New Lat deg ' deg ' Lon deg ' deg ' Diff Lat deg deg ' Lon deg deg ' So there is indeed a consistency in the changes between the old and new coordinates a correction of ' in latitude and ' in longitude no change in degrees
Apply these corrections to the presumed old coordinates of the plaque in front of the statue
Lat deg ' old Adding the latitude correction of ' gives deg ' but in the Argilan system of in ' unlike the Earth system of in ' is ' which converts the new latitude reading to Lat deg ' new Now for longitude the reading from the plaque in front of the statue Lon deg ' old ' on the longitude dial is the same position as ' see note so the longitude reading is ordm '
Adding the longitude correction of ' gives deg ' again is ' resulting in the new longitude Lon deg ' new Note while the above calculations result in a value of deg for the new longitude value in point of fact it should be ordm because when making the equivalency of ' to ' you are increasing the reading by ordm i e ' ordm
However if you enter ordm for the new longitude value it won't work the island ship will not move
Enter the newly calculated coordinates and when the hand icon is pressed the island ship is off to a new destination
A third green button on the hand icon console is illuminated
As you approach you can see that it the same rocky shore with buildings and arches that Sam saw so he is here somewhere
This must be Matia
Take the chair transporter over to it
As soon as you get out of the chair the same fellow you first saw appears again with more informative though fragmented messages thank God
You must help us
Matia is not just a defence system
It's a custodian device
The cultural heart of these people doing the right thing
Matia was meant to bring the Argilans home once the possibility of contamination that hasn't happened
Some Argilans didn't want to be isolated they wanted contact with other worlds
They found a way to link through to us in this prison zone We never realized that Matia would now see them as contaminated too that the whole population is tainted a desperate last resort
The Wanderer isn't a treasure
It may be a doomsday device after all
Matia doesn't seem to understand that we weren't plundering and pillaging that we were studying trying to help trying anything to make contact
It doesn't know that the Argilans The only thing that you can do now is climb aboard the rail car in front of you
Click on the pedestal it swings around and you are facing a tunnel in the cliff face
The unit on the pedestal has two buttons and a window displaying a new symbol which resembles a skewed letter X
A handle next to the window will change the display move it up and the next symbol resembles the letter I a third one is U shaped with a squiggle in it and a fourth symbol has no alphabetic comparison
Amuse yourself by seeing what the car does as you change symbols and press buttons
The left button is apparently non functional
You can only go so far before the car comes back part way
Presumably there is a fault in the track
Ultimately you will end up just outside a tunnel where you can leave the car and find a path and walkway on the face of a dam and that will take you to the Matia elevator the one where Sam anchored when he arrived with the fish balloon
On the way to the elevator are two doors in the face of the dam each with red symbols near the door top that you should note and each door also has a combination lock of four symbols
On one of the doors the symbols are all the same and the door is locked on the other the symbols are different and the door is not locked
Make note of these symbols
Go through the unlocked door and you will see the continuation of the railway and in the distance its terminus at a very large black prolate spheroid
At the end of a walkway to the right is a despicable railway puzzle
You are to place track sections so that you have a complete path from one side to the other as a wretchedly clever Matia computer raises gates to impede this process
Most of the time the computer wins but when you finally do succeed you will see a section of the railway rise half way to the track level
You must do the puzzle again to bring the track all the way up the catch is that you cannot fail between the attempts or the track sinks down again
Two wins in succession and you can't store the game after the first win
One strategy is to try to place tracks with alternate ways to complete the crossing so that when the computer blocks one you can use the other
It has been suggested that you concentrate more on foiling the computer rather than on track completion don't let it build a complete wall of gates from top to bottom and in the course of doing this the opportunity for a complete horizontal track will present itself
It will take time and practice but you will eventually be successful at which point save your game return the walkway on the dam face and head for the elevator
Presumably Sam is at the top of the elevator if that is where he went after his initial exploring after arriving
In any event now he and Hannah must work invisibly together
Bring Sam to the bottom elevator stop
Enter the tunnel to a room overlooking a pool across which is a barred opening through which you should briefly see somebody moving
You could get over there if you could shut off the water that keeps the pool full
Have Hannah take the elevator down to this bottom level then take the path to the right of the tunnel to its end overlooking the dam
Turn left to a wheel valve and turn it cw one click and the noise of running water stops
She has to stay there by the valve presumably holding it or the wheel reverts and the water starts running again
Back to Sam where the pool is now suddenly empty and he can go the bars whereupon a man comes to the other side and gives a rather lengthy speech as follows You can't free me
Don't even try
I'm Charles Santo
I was on Tomlin's team
Started it all persuaded them to take things
It wasn't looting
You have to understand
We were getting nowhere
We didn't know about Matia then but I agreed with Tomlin with all this tech there had to be watch systems
We had to do something make them act
Should have known better
Angela's texts said the Wanderer was called the treasure beyond price
I knew 'treasure' translated as 'ultimate gift'
That's its older name the Good Servant might well refer to a doomsday function
Save the planet save the people or destroy everything
Well you got this far
You might still have a chance
Richard Hovis came here too
Couldn't free me but found out a lot
This village Matiani makes dimensional shifts if you can find the right transfer sequence
Shifting the village is an important approach protocol Hovis said
They're the words he used
Said it's something to do with the houses
You have to enter each one twice but exit only once
He was very pleased with himself
Very excited about it
Enter twice exit once
He said he finally worked out how to get through to the Wanderer there on the other side of the dam
Said he knew the special safety measures for approaching and unlocking it
He wouldn't say what they were
He said the rest of us were wrong
Didn't understand that unlocking the Wanderer would destroy us all
Well I'm still not convinced
I say unlock it find out one way or another
Hovis promised to come back but he never did
At least you're able to go over there and find out for yourself
If you succeed come back for me
Promise you'll come back
He leaves back into the darkness
Some nuggets of information there
As to the houses mentioned there are several along a path to the left of the tunnel on the other side of a raised drawbridge
Send Sam over there to try to lower the bridge by pushing the plunger on the control that is on the post to the right of the bridge
The bridge moves a little then returns to its original position
On either side of the tunnel are two more wheel valves
Have Hannah the wheel valve expert turn the right one a click cw then have Sam try the bridge again it moves a little farther before going back
Repeat this procedure until the bridge is again moving only a little
Have Hannah turn the wheel a notch ccw so the bridge is at its greatest movement then repeat these steps using the wheel valve on the left side of the tunnel
You should be able to lower the bridge all the way
Go across the bridge and save your game
You are in the village of Matiani
On the left there are four houses in a row on the short street on the right there is one house
Number the left houses to as you come to them for convenience call the right one house X
You are now faced with the house puzzle as you learned from Santo you must enter each of the four houses twice and exit it once
If you start up the street clicking on the door handles of each house on the left you will find that you enter blackness hear a short intense humm and are back outside facing the street
In the course of these trials a priest will appear and hold out an item that goes into inventory it is a rectangular plate like the one Hannah got in the Bosh Tunnels but with a very slightly different symbol on it
If you try the door of house X when it opens the interior becomes intensely bright and the door closes
However if you don't enter the houses in order you will find that you may exit from a different one than you entered
If you start by entering house you will exit house X if you enter house you will exit house
But things change if you first enter house and exit house X then enter house you will exit house instead of
There has been no indication but as it happens entering house X resets the puzzle so don't enter it unless that is what you want to do
By much trial and error and using a table of houses vs entrances and exits don't enter a house again after you have done so twice you could satisfy the requirements of in and out for the four houses
House X is not involved unless resetting
When you finally wish to use a spoiler here it is in order enter houses
At the conclusion of the puzzle you will exit house X into a world where night has fallen street lights are on house windows show interior lights
Sam says it all feels different must be the dimensional shift Santo mentioned
He has lost contact with Hannah
Go toward the drawbridge and a woman appears
She speaks to Sam I'm glad you came
Some of us a few of us have learned your language
You are on the doorstep of our sanctuary
The decision is yours the Wanderer or the Good Servant
Which will it be
She fades away
Before and after this speech she stares up at the top of the dam
Look there and you will see a dozen objects that resemble nothing so much as bottles with glowing caps if your memory is good you will recall that they also resemble the row of similar shaped objects atop the organ computer on the platform in the Bosh Tunnels
Some are higher than others a pattern that is surely important so make a note of it
Reenter house X and come back out to your original dimension to daylight and to communication with Hannah
Go across the drawbridge and back to Santo's prison room
Turn to the left to see four closely spaced horizontal pipes
Get a closeup and you will see on these pipes squares that may each be slid back and forth so they occupy one of five positions
In the course of this should your cursor wander to the top edge of the top square it will change to the grabber form click it and the rectangular plate given to Sam by the priest in front of House X jumps to that location and one by one symbols appear in the squares
These symbols are of the general form that Hannah found in the door combination locks she saw on the damfront pathway as she came down it from the railcar and which you have of course duly noted as instructed
Slide the squares until you have made a match top to bottom of the symbols that were noted left to right in the unlocked door
Now for each of the four squares note which of the five positions on the pipes results from this matching
Remove Sam's plate back off and switch to Hannah
Have her come in and place her plate at the top of the pipe rack where Sam's was symbols appear in the squares as before
Slide the squares to the positions that gave Sam's match and note the new symbols that appear
Remove Hannah's plate
Switch back to Sam go to the elevator and go up two stops
Go along the walkway to the locked door move the settings of the combination lock to the just noted symbols and press the plunger on the door which slides up so that you can go through
You can see the see the railway as before and you can also see that one of the track sections is still below the rest of the track
Uh oh
Look to the left another of the dreaded railway puzzles and this time the computer goes first
Nothing to do but work at it until you get the track up in two successive attempts same as before
Save your game
Go back out to the pathway and go up to the railway
There is a pedestal there showing one of the railcar symbols press the button on it below the symbol and the car comes scooting up the tracks
Climb aboard and choose a symbol that will take you along the now continuous track to the terminus below the big spheroid
Leave the car and walk ahead until you see a closed panel pair hanging below the spheroid
Stand in front of the panels and find a place on the supports that will accept the key you have in inventory
Turn the key and the panels open to display a set of symbols used to direct the fish balloon
Get a closeup of these symbols and write them down
Turn around and you will see a plunger valve where two pipes come together
Press the plunger the scene shifts to the spheroid and faint noises are heard as if something wants to move but is restrained
Something more is needed
Move back toward the railway a step and you can find on either side of the path a locked Matia domed house from which are coming pipes having a section showing eight up or down buttons but at this point there is no indication how to set them
Hannah is still in the reservoir room where Santo is a prisoner
She needs to talk to him so you need to stop the water keeping the reservoir pool full
Go back to where you left the railcar at the end of the track use the call button to get the car get in and click on the pedestal and choose the drive icon to go to the cliffside path to the elevator
When you get there go the wheel valve that shuts off the pool water and move it a click
The pool is empty and Hannah can now go talk to Santo
He says if you are going to unlock the Wanderer two operations are necessary back at Bosh 'ossa' and 'dissa'
From this you get the idea that the Wanderer is the black spheroid rather than a person
So it's back to Bosh for Hannah
Go up the elevator and the path to the railway
Call the car and return to the terminus where you can use the chair transporter back to the island ship
At the hand icon control center console use the second lit green button to sail to Bosh
Use the chair transporter to get to the Tunnels and to the organ computer on the platform to the left
Set the row of twelve plunger switches along the top to the same up and down pattern that Sam saw on top of the dam when in the parallel dimension while in Matiani
From Fig
pick out the directional symbol corresponding to the ossa and dissa as directed by Santo
There is little question about ossa being W but dissa could be NE or SE NE is probably closer
Press the ossa button resulting in some interesting sounds pretty ancient computer and buttons light up in the two groups of eight along the bottom
Press the dissa button more sounds and the light patterns change
Make a record of these final two group patterns
There is nowhere else but the buttons on the pipes by the houses near the spheroid that have this pair of configurations of eight so Hannah has to travel to them
Go back again to Matia reversing the trail she just took using the third green button the island ship hand icon console
When you get off the railcar at the spheroid go to one of the pipes with the eight buttons
Which of the two patterns from the organ computer to use
Try one here the other pattern on the other pipe buttons then push the plunger opposite the fish balloon setting panel below the spheroid if nothing happens reverse the pipe button settings and try again
Whichever is correct you get a video of the top of the spheroid opening like a flower then closing
The woman that Sam saw by the dam in Matiani appears
So that's your decision
Well so be it there's still time to save your friends but you must hurry
Get to the balloon and Matia will do what it must
Think well of us
And remember we tried to Hannah wonders what they have done
Sam says they have done all they can they just don't know enough
Have Hannah go back to Santo
Have Sam go to the fish balloon at the top of the elevator and enter the latest control symbols from the panel under the spheroid and push the takeoff button on the control post
You are treated to spectacular views of Matia as the balloon soars to the spheroid which opens again
A hook is lowered into it from the balloon and retrieves what appears to be a metal ball
The balloon then flies to the island ship and lowers the ball into it
There are some poorly seen changes to the superstructure and the red and blue material disappears from the sails
The balloon returns to the top of the elevator
Take the elevator all the way down and once more stop the water from filling the pool
Have Hannah go to the bars to talk to Santo
He says You did come back
You kept your word
Keeping faith is what matters
Looking after one another
You and your friend
You must stay together do you understand
We can go now
He disappears into an optical effect
Bring both Sam and Hannah to the coordinate console on the island ship
The colored sails have returned
when they are both there a priest appears and gestures to that bunch of tentacles that you looked at when Hannah came here the first time
Look at the center of whatever it is and see a golden sea star or perhaps a stylized representation of the sun
Whatever click on it for a rather startling concluding video in which Sam and Hannah are finally seen together and Angela Davies appears to tell them without ever directly looking at them what went on and give a somewhat lame wrapup to the game story
Who are the three of you

Please note that this walkthrough is copyrighted Hence anyattempt to reproduceanythingfrom this walkthrough will beseverelypunished to themaximumextent of the law
Introduction Although I have been playing computer games for over five years now I started writing walkthroughs only about a month ago and only because of the encouragement by a dear friend In fact this is only thesecondwalkthrough that I have written My first one was onMidnight Nowhere a game that was nowhere ascleanandintriguingas but certainly a lot more difficult and complicated than this one
Unlike my first walkthrough however this one has no graphics i e screenshots That was not bymychoice The developers of the game appear to have used a platform that waseitherso sophisticated that it blocks any attempts to take screenshot ornot sophisticated enough to allow them Whatever the reason I personally found it to be rather unfortunate because I really believe that a picturedoesspeak a thousand words I have tried to compensate for the problem by providing as much detail as possible hoping to ensure thatanyonewould be able to enjoy the game regardless of their particular level of expertise in game playing I have also supplemented my efforts to illustrate by using diagrams wherever possible Please note however that these diagrams are by no means quot to scale quot As I indicated their sole purpose is to provide thequickestand thesimplestmeans of finding your way around the house as well as in its environment For your reassurance please note Warning
Spoiler that youwillfind the quot actual quot blueprints of the house at least somewhere in the middle of the game
Once again I am still only a quot beginner quot when it comes to writing walkthroughs Hence any encouragement as well as comments and questions of course will be greatly appreciated Please direct all of these toZSZUBAIRIE AOL com Thank you
About the Game This is undoubtedly one of the best games that I have ever played Please note however that itcanbeextremelyscary Hence I wouldstrongly adviseplayersunderthe age of eighteen and even older if you happen to have an incredibly strong imagination and or something of a sensitive heart againstplaying this game
Please note also that there is at leastonetechnical bug in the game which can be rather irritating if you happen to be somewhat compulsive like me who likes to replay a conversation or dialogue just to be able to hear a particular segment or phrase whileskippingthe rest Thus if you use the ESC key once too often say when you are on the phone with someone you are often likely to get a quot Breakpoint quot error message The game would hang and nothing will seem to help Don't Worry and Don't Panic Just click OK on the error message Then press CTRL ALT DEL all together A Task Manager window will pop up Press the quot End Task quot button in the lower part of that window Another window will then pop up warning you not to continue or you will lose unsaved data etc Don't pay any attention to this message because you have actually lost any such data already So just press the quot End Now quot choice on this particular window and WAIT Soon enough might well take a minute or so you will be brought back to your Desktop The Task Manager window might still be open however Try to close it but its buttons to do so quot X quot or Close might be grayed out In that case just right click on the little green box at the lower left corner of the screen next to the Time Date spot and click on Close in the menu that pops up Whenall else fails just switch off the computer of course
The Walkthrough Generally The Icons There are only three icons in this game The Open Hand indicates action for example opening the door picking up an object etc Click on the open hand every time you are told to perform an action in this walkthrough Clicking on the icon with the hand pointingsideways will allow you tostep outof a close up etc Finally the hand with the finger pointing straight ahead indicates that you can go in that direction
The Inventory Right click to open the inventory Click on the item you want and then right click again to close the inventory You will see the item out on the screen now Apply it to where you think it should go If you are right the item will brighten up Click on the spot where it does and a cut scene will usually do the rest
The Slideshow You will find this feature in the Setup Turning it OFF allows you to explore your surroundings in the normal way However using this mode also has two disadvantages First you are likely to miss a critical clue as your cursor speeds right past it Also it might make you rather dizzy especially if you happen to have a mouse with the tracking ball on top which tends to make things move really fast on the screen Thus your eyes might actually quot appreciate quot it if you turn the quot slideshow quot ON You can then examine your surroundings more carefully on a frame by frame basis and the chances of missing a pertinent clue are also less The downside of it of course is that it does tend to be a bit more laborious than the natural mode

Step out of this close up and click on the top drawer to your right to open it Click on the pencil in the lower left side of the drawer to deposit it in your inventory Now open your inventory pick up the pencil and put it on the sheet of the paper to reveal a letter written in Italian
Note for those who may not be familiar with this old technique whenever we write on the top sheet of a writing tablet we leave animprintof our writing on the page right under the one we use By using the edge of the lead of a dark colored pencil you can gently shade across the page and awhiteimage of the writing will appear against the gray shading we etched revealing everything that was scribbled on the page above Thus the game designers have actually erred by showing adarkwriting against awhitepage in the inventory because in reality it would be the opposite Nevertheless the idea is that this is how the hero gets his hands on what had been written on the topmost sheet now obviously removed The problem now however is to get the message translated so that we canunderstandwhat had been written on the missing page
Step out of the inventory and close up on the black and white photograph that is lying under some writing tablet that was under the pencil you just picked As you get the close up click on the picture again and read the comment at the bottom of the screen indicating that it was an old picture of the kitchen you just left Notice the large key hanging on the wall to the left of the door you had used to enter the kitchen There is a large urn right under the key in this picture However neither the key nor the urn is in that place in the kitchen now The clue here is that the key had fallen in the urn that has apparently been removed So you must now find the urn in order to find the key
Step out of the close up on the desk now and move towards the large chest of drawers against the wall on your left There are two small drawers at the top and two large ones under them Open each of them click on the contents and then close to do the same with the rest of the drawers There is nothing of interest in any of these drawers however except that the contents of the small drawer on the left indicate that the room had been used by someone quite interested in photography

Spend some more time clicking on boxes under the stairs and in the center of the Basement until your hero reports feeling a sudden breeze on his neck Step out of the basement then and make your way back to the Phone Room Call Jerry first Again you don't have to do anything further but to listen to the conversation When the two men hang up pick up the phone again and call Barbara the secretary now Again listen to the conversation as the hero asks her to translate a letter written in Italian and she tells him to send it to her As the conversation ends step out of the close up and open your inventory Pick up the letter you had found in the maid's room Place it on the envelope you had retrieved from the study to seal the letter Now put your pen on the envelope to write the address on it The letter is all set to be mailed So step out of the house and head for the main gates Close up on the mailbox to the left of the main gates Click on it to open it bring out your sealed letter from the inventory and place it inside the mailbox Close the box again step out of the close up and return to the house

Turn around away from the bed and close up on the little oval mirror sitting on the table to the right of the bed Click on it and it will change its angle a little bit Step out of the close up and look to the right of the large mirror at the wall

Click on the white piece of cloth you find in the large middle drawer at the bottom to deposit it in your inventory You are done in this room now so exit

The stairs to the attic are immediately to your right Step forward however and try to open the door to your right the one marked with a quot quot in the diagram appearing to theleftof the stairs you had used to come up to this floor The comment at the bottom of the screen indicates however that the door seems to be stuck So comearoundthe stairs to the attic and try to open the door to your left theotherdoor marked with a quot quot in the diagram The comment at the bottom of the screen tells you that the door is locked but that the hero can see a key on theotherside of the door in the keyhole Turn to your left then and click on the newspaper on the ground to deposit it in your inventory Bring the newspaper out of your inventory and place itunderthe door Now bring the quot boring tool quot out of your inventory place it on the keyhole and click to read the comment at the bottom of the screen that the key has been knocked down and has thus landed onto the newspaper So pick up the newspaper from the floor only to read the comment at the bottom of the screen that the key got stuck on the other side of the door Click on the door handle to find that there is no way to get the key now

Call Jerry now and listen to the conversation between the two men Since the hero couldn't find any candles in the house he must now drive over to town and buy some So as the two men hang up step out of the house through the front door and head for your car standing by the main gates Get in the car bring out your car keys from the inventory and place them on the quot car starter quot i e the ignition in the little white circle right under the red one on the right side of the steering wheel Click to place the key in the ignition and then again to try to start the car The engine purrs a little and dies out as the red bulb above the car starter starts flashing The comment at the bottom of the screen indicates that the hero had left the lights on when he had first gotten out of the car Click on the ignition again and the comment at the bottom of the screen will tell you that the car battery is dead So step out of the car and return to the house to call Jerry again
Jerry will tell you now to go to sleep but the hero won't be quot allowed quot to do so by the game designers until he does three more things two of these being to call Jerry again So as the two men hang up the first time call Jerry again You will have a choice of two topics as indicated at the bottom of the screen the previous inhabitants of the house and the safe Click on the first topic Jerry will tell you then about a murder that took place in the house back in May As the two men hang up again call Jerry once more This time you won't be given any choices at the bottom of the screen as the hero will automatically start talking about the safe
As it will turn out Jerry does have the information but not readily available so he will end the conversation promising to give the information tomorrow Note the reason that the two men keep hanging up is that the game is designed so that you can call Jerry up as soon as you discover something that you can relate to him in order to receive some information from him in return Rather than running back and forth to and from the phone however we are taking care of a few things at the same time The downside of course is that we need to keep calling Jerry until all the necessary information has been exchanged between the two men
As this last conversation ends go back up to the attic and try to pick up a newspaper A single choice will appear at the bottom of the screen relating to a news story in the date of May Click on this choice and you will get a close up of a news page detailing the account of the murder Jerry had mentioned You are done for the day now So go to your room downstairs and towards the bed As you see the Open Hand icon on the bed the comment at the bottom of the screen will confirm that it is time to go to sleep

Note The idea is toflushthat shiny object out into that quot small pool of water quot under the grey arching tree But if you were to go back to the tree right now you will not find it there yet The problem is that there is an obstruction ndash right here in the greenhouse ndash that is preventing the shiny object from making its way back to the tree

About the Ending Warning Spoiler It seems quite certain that James Blackwood did die although it might not necessarily have been due to a heart attack as the public was led to believe Again it seems quite certain that the doctorisstill alive and is the one who has been quot taking care quot of the creature dropping off food from the grating down into the lair etc The doctor was no doubt also the man whose silhouette Arthate saw the second night from the furnace shaft in the cellar What isnotso clear however and yet most intriguing is the identity of thecreatureitself
I must confess that the first time I played this game I was quite certain that the creature was none other than a member of the tribe who used to guard the mask ndash someone who might have followed Blackwood after he stole the mask trying to get it back But then I had a good friend of mine play the game andherinitial impression was that the creature might have been Blackwood's own child In fact I actually convinced her to my point of view But having replayed the game in order to write this walkthrough I am inclined to agree with her now My biggest objection to her theory had been the age of the child But I noticed this second time that I played the game that the child had been born in and that Jerry's letter in Arthate's suitcase shows that it is now Hence if the childisalive he would be fifteen years old now and I think the creature we see in the end might well quot pass quot for a fifteen year old albeit a very strong and massive one at that
Indeed assuming that the creatureisthe Blackwood child helps explain a number of things ndash for instance the free quot room and board quot given to the creature the apparent disgust and disappointment with which the nursery seems to have been all sealed up showing that the couple didn't seem to want to eventryhaving another baby how Catherine managed to get her throat ripped out she might have just wanted to see the child out of pure maternal love and was no doubt taken by a complete surprise by the creature's violent reaction why James could not bringhimselfto kill the creature since he was after all its father and wanted the doctor to do it instead and why the doctor himself had difficulty carrying out Blackwood's wishes being a loyal friend of the family as well as the doctor who had helped in the delivery of the child in the first place in spite of the fact that the creature had so violently killed a woman he obviously cared for deeply as evidenced by the letter in the locked study drawer
Finally there is a question if there ever evenwasany quot real quot evil in the house Personally I think there was As the various journal entries indicated the evil was supposed to have been trapped in the mask It was kept at bay only by the rituals that the tribe used to perform on the mask These rituals could not be continued of course when the mask was stolen by Blackwood Thus the evil was quot released quot so to speak and was no doubt what caused whatever the tragedy was involving the childbirth But again if the creaturewasthe Blackwood child then it might well have been that the Evil hadpermeatedthe child before it was even born
At any rate this is my personal take on the story at least up to this point Please feel free to disagree or just discuss any and all aspects of the story or the game
Meanwhile Hope you all had a great Christmas and a very happy New Year too

Scratches The Director's Cut A Walkthrough by ZURREEN ZUBAIRIE Copyright All rights reserved
Please note that this walkthrough is copyrighted Hence anyattempt to reproduceanythingfrom this walkthrough will beseverelypunished to themaximumextent of the law
Introduction The developers of quot Scratches quot have delivered this special version of the game with a promise of better graphics an alternate ending to the original game and a brand new chapter which is actually a kind of Epilog to the Blackwood saga Unfortunately however you need to install a rather large patch to enjoy both the better graphics and to trigger that alternate ending While there are plenty of patches available online I am not sure if they will all work especially to trigger that elusive alternate ending Personally I had to install the one patch that is provided by GameSpot under quot Scratches The Director's Cut quot It was a very long file about MB and even with broadband it took me three hours to download it An English friend of mine tells me however that you can get the exact same patch from The Patches Scroll and download it in just minutes Thanks Roy
So feel free to try there first
Note You can certainly play both the original game entitled Scratches The Director's Cut or the Epilogue entitled The Last Visit withoutthe patch As I mentioned however you will not be able to get the better graphics nor trigger the alternate ending Moreover you will run into one major computer error the hand icon on the front door appears on theleftside of the door even though the door handle appears on the right when you approach the door from the outside The problem is reversed when you are trying to step outside the house the hand icon appears on theright even though the door handle appears on the left side of the door The patch corrects both these errors
Some General Notes about this Walkthrough Again as in the case of my walkthrough for the original Scratches this one has no graphics i e screenshots either As I mentioned then that was not bymychoice The developers of the game appear to have used a platform that waseitherso sophisticated that it blocks any attempts to take screenshots ornot sophisticated enough to allow them Whatever the reason I personally found it to be rather unfortunate because I believe that a picturedoesspeak a thousand words I have tried to compensate for the problem by providing as much detail as possible hoping to ensure thatanyonewould be able to enjoy the game regardless of their particular level of expertise in game playing I have also supplemented my efforts to illustrate by using diagrams wherever possible Please note however that these diagrams are by no means quot to scale quot As I indicated their sole purpose is to provide thequickestand thesimplestmeans of finding your way around the house as well as in its environment For your reassurance please note Warning
Spoiler that youwillfind the quot actual quot blueprints of the house at least somewhere in the middle of the game
Well that is all that I can think of by way of an introduction both to the game and the following walkthrough Please do feel free to ask any questions make any comments or just talk about the game by contacting me atZSZUBAIRIE AOL com Thank you
The Walkthrough Generally The Icons There are only three icons in this game The Open Hand indicates action for example opening the door picking up an object etc Click on the open hand every time you are told to perform an action in this walkthrough Clicking on the icon with the hand pointingsideways will allow you tostep outof a close up etc Finally the hand with the finger pointing straight ahead indicates that you can go in that direction
The Inventory Right click to open the inventory Click on the item you want and then right click again to close the inventory You will see the item out on the screen now Apply it to where you think it should go If you are right the item will brighten up Click on the spot where it does and a cut scene will usually do the rest
The Slideshow You will find this feature in the Setup Turning it OFF allows you to explore your surroundings in the normal way
However using this mode also has two disadvantages First you are likely to miss a critical clue as your cursor speeds right past it Also it might make you rather dizzy especially if you happen to have a mouse with the tracking ball on top which tends to make things move really fast on the screen Thus your eyes might actually quot appreciate quot it if you turn the quot slideshow quot ON You can then examine your surroundings more carefully on a frame by frame basis and the chances of missing a pertinent clue are also less The downside of it of course is that it does tend to be a bit more laborious than the natural mode
Saturday October th Day One You arrive at the Blackwood Manor and are automatically brought out of the car Turn to your left though and click on the car door to open it and get back inside Now open the glove compartment and retrieve the car keys Step out of the close up and then click on the door to get out of the car again
Step directly towards the mansion now You will have to goaroundthe fountain to do so As you reach the front door open your inventory and bring out the large key Place it on the door handle and click to unlock the door Click on the door handle itself then to open the door and enter You will find yourself in a small hall with the stairs to your left and a small room in the front See diagram below Remember you are lugging around two rather large cases so it would be best to take the load off first So go directly up the stairs
Notice thesilentremark at thebottom of your screenjust as you reach the top of the stairs It is important to pay attention to these remarks because they will often give you some clues
Enter the first room on your right
This is your bedroom Turn around and try to flip the light switch next to the door It is not working however as the comment at the bottom will also confirm Move towards the large desk across the room Open the inventory to bring out thesecondcase and place it on the desk Open the case Now click on the papers inside to see them automatically come out and neatly placed on the right side of the desk Now click on the type writer to see it also come out and be placed in the center of the desk Click on the case twice then to close it and then to put it away

Now that you have seen the numbers you can call either of these people whenever you consider it appropriate to do so
Click on the envelope to the right in the suitcase open it and then click on to read the four pages inside Click on the blue hard cover book to see the hero's latest work in print
Step out of this close up Now click on the top drawer Click on the papers inside and repeatedly to see that they are all drawings and sketches on human anatomy Close this drawer and open the next one to find some bottles inside Close this drawer also and open the last one at the bottom It is empty Close this drawer too and go to the right of the desk Close up on the wastebasket on the floor and pick up the piece of paper lying inside Read it Step out of this close up then Click on the two shelves of the bookcase to your right to find nothing of interest to the hero So move towards the fireplace now on the other side of the bed Close up on the little black bag sitting on the floor to the right of the fireplace Open it and pick up the stethoscope Click on the papers and quot flip quot through them as well by clicking repeatedly to find more drawings on anatomy Step out of this close up You might want to look at the doctor's certificate up on the wall to the left of the fireplace indicating that this had been the doctor's bedroom as well and explaining all those drawings and sketches on anatomy Close up and click on the fireplace itself to find quot remnants of a previous fire quot You are done in this room for now so come downstairs again The phone should be ringing in the Phone Room Refer to the earlier diagram
If not give it a few seconds As it starts ringing then close up on it and answer it
It is a call from Jerry The conversation will continue without your having to do anything further As the other guy hangs up your hero will do the same Now call your secretary Barbara As you pick up the phone three choices will appear at the bottom of the screen Just click on thesecondchoice with her name in it
This conversation will be just cheerful and casual and the only important thing you will learn is that she is studying quot tongues quot i e different languages Step out of the close up and towards the front door Click on the door handle to open the door and step outside Go to the main gate where your car is parked As you reach the main gate read the comment that will appear at the bottom of the screen and then close up on the little black mailbox situated to theleftof the barred gate Click on the mailbox to open it and then on the yellow note inside to pick it up and read it Note the note disappears altogether once you step out of this close up so either save your game on this note or read it as carefully as you would like the very first time

Step out of this close up and click on the top drawer to your right to open it Click on the pencil in the lower left side of the drawer to deposit it in your inventory Now open your inventory pick up the pencil and put it on the sheet of the paper to reveal a letter written in Italian
Note for those who may not be familiar with this old technique whenever we write on the top sheet of a writing tablet we leave animprintof our writing on the page right under the one we use By using the edge of the lead of a dark colored pencil you can gently shade across the page and awhiteimage of the writing will appear against the gray shading we etched revealing everything that was scribbled on the page above Thus the game designers have actually erred by showing adarkwriting against awhitepage in the inventory because in reality it would be the opposite Nevertheless the idea is that this is how the hero gets his hands on what had been written on the topmost sheet now obviously removed The problem now however is to get the message translated so that we canunderstandwhat had been written on the missing page
Step out of the inventory and close up on the black and white photograph that is lying under some writing tablet that was under the pencil you just picked As you get the close up click on the picture again and read the comment at the bottom of the screen indicating that it was an old picture of the kitchen you just left Notice the large key hanging on the wall to the left of the door you had used to enter the kitchen There is a large urn right under the key in this picture However neither the key nor the urn is in that place in the kitchen now The clue here is that the key had fallen in the urn that has apparently been removed So you must now find the urn in order to find the key

Spend some more time clicking on boxes under the stairs and in the center of the Basement until your hero reports feeling a sudden breeze on his neck Step out of the basement then and make your way back to the Phone Room Call Jerry first Again you don't have to do anything further but to listen to the conversation When the two men hang up pick up the phone again and call Barbara the secretary now Again listen to the conversation as the hero asks her to translate a letter written in Italian and she tells him to send it to her As the conversation ends step out of the close up and open your inventory Pick up the letter you had found in the maid's room Place it on the envelope you had retrieved from the study to seal the letter Now put your pen on the envelope to write the address on it The letter is all set to be mailed So step out of the house and head for the main gates Close up on the mailbox to the left of the main gates Click on it to open it bring out your sealed letter from the inventory and place it inside the mailbox Close the box again step out of the close up and return to the house

The stairs to the attic are immediately to your right Step forward however and try to open the door to your right the one marked with a quot quot in the diagram appearing to theleftof the stairs you had used to come up to this floor The comment at the bottom of the screen indicates however that the door seems to be stuck So comearoundthe stairs to the attic and try to open the door to your left theotherdoor marked with a quot quot in the diagram The comment at the bottom of the screen tells you that the door is locked but that the hero can see a key on theotherside of the door in the keyhole Turn to your left then and click on the newspaper on the ground to deposit it in your inventory Bring the newspaper out of your inventory and place itunderthe door Now bring the quot boring tool quot out of your inventory place it on the keyhole and click to read the comment at the bottom of the screen that the key has been knocked down and has thus landed onto the newspaper So pick up the newspaper from the floor only to read the comment at the bottom of the screen that the key got stuck on the other side of the door Click on the door handle to find that there is no way to get the key now

Jerry will tell you now to go to sleep but the hero won't be quot allowed quot to do so by the game designers until he does three more things two of these being to call Jerry again So as the two men hang up the first time call Jerry again You will have a choice of two topics as indicated at the bottom of the screen the previous inhabitants of the house and the safe Click on the first topic Jerry will tell you then about a murder that took place in the house back in May As the two men hang up again call Jerry once more This time you won't be given any choices at the bottom of the screen as the hero will automatically start talking about the safe
As it will turn out Jerry does have the information but not readily available so he will end the conversation promising to give the information tomorrow Note the reason that the two men keep hanging up is that the game is designed so that you can call Jerry up as soon as you discover something that you can relate to him in order to receive some information from him in return Rather than running back and forth to and from the phone however we are taking care of a few things at the same time The downside of course is that we need to keep calling Jerry until all the necessary information has been exchanged between the two men
As this last conversation ends go back up to the attic and try to pick up a newspaper A single choice will appear at the bottom of the screen relating to a news story in the date of May Click on this choice and you will get a close up of a news page detailing the account of the murder Jerry had mentioned You are done for the day now So go to your room downstairs and towards the bed As you see the Open Hand icon on the bed the comment at the bottom of the screen will confirm that it is time to go to sleep

Go down into the basement then and close up on the valve to your right Place the crowbar you got from the garage on the valve Use the hammer on the crowbar then to turn the valve around Pick up your crowbar now Click on the valve just to make sure you are done and the comment at the bottom of the screen will indicate that there is no need to fiddle further with the valve Come back up to the kitchen and try the taps in the sink again The water is running now but not coming out of the taps Go back to the greenhouse and around the dead tree and close up on the tap below Right next to the tap to the left you will find the end of the hose you had slipped down the railing earlier Click at that end of the hose and see it attach itself to the tap
Turn on the tap now to hear the sound of water going through Go up the metal stairway then and pick up the shovel from the planter Come down to the tap again and remove the hose letting the water drain into the grating Come around to where you had seen the shiny object You might have to wait a few seconds until you hear a tiny jingling sound and then the shiny object would be gone
Note The idea is toflushthat shiny object out into that quot small pool of water quot under the grey arching tree But if you were to go back to the tree right now you will not find it there yet The problem is that there is an obstruction ndash right here in the greenhouse ndash that is preventing the shiny object from making its way back to the tree

About the Ending Warning Spoiler It seems quite certain that James Blackwood did die although it might not necessarily have been due to a heart attack as the public was led to believe Again it seems quite certain that the doctorisstill alive and is the one who has been quot taking care quot of the creature dropping off food from the grating down into the lair etc The doctor was no doubt also the man whose silhouette Arthate saw the second night from the furnace shaft in the cellar What isnotso clear however and yet most intriguing is the identity of thecreatureitself
I must confess that the first time I played this game I was quite certain that the creature was none other than a member of the tribe who used to guard the mask ndash someone who might have followed Blackwood after he stole the mask trying to get it back But then I had a friend of mine play the game andherinitial impression was that the creature might have been Blackwood's own child In fact I actually convinced her to my point of view But having replayed the game in order to write this walkthrough I am inclined to agree with her now My biggest objection to her theory had been the age of the child But I noticed this second time that I played the game that the child had been born in and that Jerry's letter in Arthate's suitcase shows that it is now Hence if the childisalive he would be fifteen years old now and I think the creature we see in the end might well quot pass quot for a fifteen year old albeit a very strong and massive one at that
Indeed assuming that the creatureisthe Blackwood child helps explain a number of things ndash for instance the free quot room and board quot given to the creature the apparent disgust and disappointment with which the nursery seems to have been all sealed up showing that the couple didn't seem to want to eventryhaving another baby how Catherine managed to get her throat ripped out she might have just wanted to see the child out of pure maternal love and was no doubt taken by a complete surprise by the creature's violent reaction why James could not bringhimselfto kill the creature since he was after all its father and wanted the doctor to do it instead and why the doctor himself had difficulty carrying out Blackwood's wishes being a loyal friend of the family as well as the doctor who had helped in the delivery of the child in the first place in spite of the fact that the creature had so violently killed a woman he obviously cared for deeply as evidenced by the letter in the locked study drawer
Finally there is a question if there ever evenwasany quot real quot evil in the house Personally I think there was As the various journal entries indicated the evil was supposed to have been trapped in the mask It was kept at bay only by the rituals that the tribe used to perform on the mask These rituals could not be continued of course when the mask was stolen by Blackwood Thus the evil was quot released quot so to speak and was no doubt what caused whatever the tragedy was involving the childbirth But again if the creaturewasthe Blackwood child then it might well have been that the Evil hadpermeatedthe child before it was even born
At any rate this is my personal take on the story at least up to this point Please feel free to disagree or just discuss any and all aspects of the story or the game
The Alternate Ending Note I must confess that I had a difficult time triggering that alternate ending because I was trying to do it without the patch As I mentioned at the beginning you cannot trigger the alternate ending without this patch So I am truly grateful to a friend for steering me in the right direction Thanks MaG
To repeat then the first thing you need to trigger the alternate ending isthe patch of course Once you install this patch you must play the original game from the beginning You do everything the same as before as outlined in the preceding walkthrough with the following exception youmustgo and click on the typewriterfrequently Note that you will get the hero to actually type only once in the game i e on the second evening as indicated in the above walkthrough Nevertheless you must still go to the typewriter and click on it even though the hero will refuse to type just then
Other players have indicated that you need to type every hours Having already played the game so many times in trying to trigger that alternate ending without the patch before I decided not to quot take any chances quot and went to click on the typewriter every time I did something new in the game like picking up an item talking to Jerry etc
I noticed though that when you click on the typewriter the message at the bottom of the screen does change once every two to three hours The changing of the message tells you that you are on the right track of course and you need to quot catch quot each message in order to trigger the alternate ending So feel free to go and click on the typewriter as frequently as you wish I noticed a few things however that might help reduce your quot labor quot I noticed that the message changed at the following times in the three days On the first day after the first message at a m the second appeared at noon the third at p m and the fourth and final at p m When I woke up the first night I clicked on the typewriter right after I woke up and before going back to sleep ndash it was the same message both times On the second day after the first message at a m again the second appeared at p m the third time the hero started typing at p m and then the final message appeared at p m after the hero finished typing When I woke up the second night I clicked on the typewriter right after getting up and before going back to sleep and it was the same message both times Finally on the third day after the first message at a m the second appeared at a m and the third and the final appeared at p m Note As you may already know you don't need to go down and click on the grandfather clock to keep track of time When you want to check the time justsaveyour game and then click on either quot Load quot or quot Save quot The time in the game will appear in the title of the Save for example quot guest room Sunday a m quot But you don't have to actually loadorsave then Just click on quot Back quot a couple of times to return to the game
You can safely do everything that you need to do all at once in the garage the greenhouse the crypt and the chapel without having to run back to and from the house to click on the typewriter Do only ONE location at a time though so the time won't change too rapidly and cause you to miss a click and thus a new message on the typewriter
Note Some players have noted that you can tell if you are on the right track if on your last click at the typewriter the comment at the bottom of the screen reads quot I didn't want to touch the typewriter quot and you find the entry quot I am not Michael Arthate quot in the journal This is actually not true Both those things the comment and the journal entry appearwhether or notyou have triggered the alternate ending
As you thus proceed through the game you should get your first confirmation that you are on the right track when you call the police chief on the third day After a little bit of dialog between the two men you will be given a choice of two statements at the bottom of the screen Pick thesecondchoice quot Please Mr Bailey I beg you quot The dialog will continue and then you will be given a choice of two statements at the bottom of the screen once more Pick thesecondchoice again quot There's got to be something else quot
Continue the game clicking on the typewriter frequently until you come down the stairs at the end of the game As you go down the fireplace in the living room and through the hidden passage you will know that you have triggered the alternate ending when you unbolt the door and enter the Lair hellip Note Be sure to pick up the piece of paper in the quot critical quot corner and read the messages at the bottom of the screen on your way out of the Lair hellip About the Alternate Ending Warning Spoiler I am not going to say much about the alternative ending except to note that I personally found it to be rather counter intuitive for two main reasons First at least in the United States banks tend to declare an account as Dead and the contents quot revert quot to the State unless you make a deposit even of a penny once every three months In other words the government thinks you must be dead and makes off with everything in your account I confess that I don't know if the same is true in England but I would expect them to have a similar rule What government wouldn't want to make off with a citizen's money especially if they think he or she is already dead
Yet if you called the bank in this game and picked the choices outlined in my walkthrough the banker Robert Blake will tell you that James Blackwood's account is still active According to this alternate ending however everyone has long been dead So how is Blackwood's account still active
The alternate ending also fails to answer another critical question since everyoneissupposed to be long dead Catherine is buried in the garden both Milton and Robin are supposed to be in their respective coffins in the Crypt and now we find James Blackwood's body as well who bolted the door to the Lair
Once again though this is just my personal take on the ending Please feel free to disagree or discuss your own ideas about any and all aspects of the ending or the game itself

Head all the way back into the building
Walk to the bookcase at the right side of captain Blackwood
Take the book on the upper shelve
Read the book and you see some pictures of an elephant

Turn to the left and walk towards the other bookcase
On the upper shelve you'll find the Seventh Book of Knowledge the book Kate told you about

Go down the stairs
Turn to the left and notice the white beam that points to the pillar next to you
See the square on the upper part of the pillar
Open that square and take the bas relief and
The opened square now captain Blackwood shows who and what he really is
He not only steals the bas relief but also knocks you unconscious
And not only that
He also locks you into a sarcophagus that cannot be opened just like that
A room with a view When you study the stone tablet you seen discover that this actually is a pre historic Sudoka puzzle
Just keep on clicking on the upper left empty square
You'll see that it has nine different images
When you do this with another empty square you'll see the same nine different images in the same order
So this means that each and every image represents a cipher
With the button on top of the puzzle you can reset the whole puzzle
Press that button
In the next table I give you the complete solution to this Sudoka puzzle
With the numbers I tell you how many times you have to press an empty square on each and every row from the left to the right
So where I say in the first row it means that you have to press the first empty square on the first row seven times the second empty square three times the third empty square eight times the fourth empty square five times and the fifth empty square six times
Here we go
first row second row third row fourth row fifth row sixth row seventh row eighth row ninth row And here you can see how it should look like
One click on the right bottom square will finish the job
When you have done this correctly the sarcophagus opens and you'll pop out
Look at the statue in front of you
Take the trident from the statue
Go forward and examine the bas relief
Turn around and study the tile in the floor
Walk forward and exit the room
Turn to the right and go forward
Go down the stairs

Exhaust all dialogs
Head all the way back into the building
Go up the stairs and enter the opened room once more
Walk one step forward
Examine the bas relief one more time but leave it alone after that
Turn around and see that Kate is standing on the pressure tile
Turn around and face the bas relief
Now remember the book with the elephants you have red earlier
I told you to remember the directions those elephants
So press the bas reliefs in that order
Huhhh you have forgotten
Okay no elephants no cookies
Just kidding of course
Here is how you have to press the bas reliefs press the left relief once press the right relief three times and finally press the left relief twice
When you have done this correctly you notice that the door at the back wall of the room opens
Go through that door and go forward
Examine the fresco at the left wall
Talk to Kate and exhaust all dialogs
Breath taking isn't it
Turn to the left and go up the stairs
Head all the way back to the Zeppelin

Turn to the right and go forward twice along the brick wall
Here you'll face a beehive
Leave it alone for now but believe me you are facing a nice puzzle for later on
Turn to the right and go further up
In front of the temple turn to the right and pick up four
stones
Turn to the left and walk to the right side of the temple
Use the hoe on the green plant
Pick up the red roots
Turn around and go one step forward
Turn to the right and enter the temple
Examine everything you can
Look at the blue yellow painting on the wall
As Kate explains this bas relief represents the Dragon of Marduk
Notice that four stones of the bas relief are missing
Also notice that the seize of the missing stones is different
Now remember that you just picked up four stones in front of the temple
That can't be no coincidence
First we are going to measure the seize of each missing stone
Place the grille over the empty upper square
The seize of this missing stone is x
Take back the grille and place it over the empty one but upper square
The seize of this missing stone is x
Take back the grille and place it over the empty right square
The seize of this missing stone is x
Take back the grille and place it over the empty left square
The seize of this missing stone is x too
Take back the grille
Taking measures Exit the temple
Turn to the right and go down the path
You are facing the beehive again
Light the smoker with the box of matches
Use the smoking smoker on the beehive to scare away the bees
Remove the roof from the beehive
Look how cute all those bees
Well believe me you can't see no bee for days when you finished this puzzle
Your goal is to get all yellow bees from the left to the right and all the orange bees from the right to the left by using the smoking smoker
The main thing is that you leave enough room for the bees to jump forward
I numbered the front row of yellow bees Y the second row of yellow bees Y and the back row of yellow bees Y
With the orange bees I did the same but changed the Y for an O
So I numbered them O O and O
Here we go Y O O Y Y Y O O O Y Y Y O Y Put away the smoker and click on the beehive
Surprise
Get your smoker again and here we go again Y O O Y Y Y O O O O Y Y Y Y O O O O Y Y Y O O Y Put away the smoker and click on the beehive
Surprise
Get your smoker one more time and here we go for the last time Y O O Y Y Y O O O O Y Y Y Y Y O O O O O Y Y Y Y Y O O O O Y Y Y O Y Put away the smoker
Take the center frame full of honey from the beehive
It might be wise to save your game here
Turn around and head back to the village
Head back to the woman by the stove
Give her the frame full of honey
Walk to the well
Speak to little Jyan about the locked door
Great she won't tell you anything about it
Wait a little and see how Omarim is getting his honey bread from the lady by the stove
Head back to the woman
Talk to her about Omarim
Turn to the left and talk to Omarim
Give him the bronze medallion
Talk to Omarim once more and exhaust all dialogs

Turn around and walk towards the first house
Go forward one more step
Go down the path at the left side of the circular brick wall
Turn to the left and cut a piece of pivot wire with your shears
Combine the twisted metal wire with the bucket
Turn to the right and go down one more step
Talk to the herbalist about the plant and about Omarim
Turn to the right and go up the path twice
Turn around and go up the path between the two brick walls
You are standing between the beehives again
Turn around and take the plant
The plant and the snake While you take the plant you will be bitten by a snake
The venom of this snake is fatal
It's good you traded your pearl to theherb poultice with that herbalist
If not you would be dead by now
Head back to the village and walk to the well
Place the bucket with handle on the hook above the well
Pan to the right and turn the lever of the well
Take the doll out of the bucket and give it to little Jyan
Talk to her once more about the locked door
Pan to the left and walk to the house with the wheel against the wall
Turn to the left and move the wooden pole laying on the ground

Turn to the left and walk to Omarim
Give him the Aloe leaf
Talk to him once more and ask him about the first aid
He gives you a bowl of medication
Head back to the last house at the right side
Enter the house and give Omarim's remedy to captain Blackwood
Talk to him and exhaust all dialogs
Exit the house
Turn to the left and go forward once
Pan to the left and look down the yellow floor outside the workshop
I'm sure the pattern on the floor will ring a bell
Remember you measured the missing stones of the painting in the temple
Also remember that you picked up four big stones in front of the temple
We are going to chop those four stones one by one to the correct seize
First we are going to make the biggest missing stone with the seize of x
Drop one of the stones for cutting on the floor
Use your stonecutter's tool twice on the stone
One stone x Pick up the cut stone
Drop the next stone for cutting on the floor
Now we are going to cut the one but biggest missing stone with the seize of x
Drop one of the stones for cutting on the floor
Use your stonecutter's tool four times on the stone
Pick up the cut stone
Now we are going to make the two smallest stone with the seize of x each
Drop another stone for cutting on the floor
Use your stonecutter's tool seven times on the stone
Pick up the cut stone
Drop the last stone for cutting on the floor
Use your stonecutter's tool seven times on this stone too
Pick up the cut stone
Now you should have four cut stones in your inventory
They should look like this Four correctly seized stones Turn to the left and go forward twice
Go up the path between the two brick walls and head back to the temple
Enter the temple
Don't do what captain Blackwood tells you yet
But keep in mind his words that you have to place the bronze medallion in the trident
Walk to the bas relief on the wall
Place the four cut stones into the appropriate empty squares
Great nothing happens
They do fit nicely but Well that is because the colors are missing
Head back to the village
Enter the workshop
Place the sieve over the bowl next to the little burner
Take the pestle from the bowl next to it
Put the red roots in the bowl
Use the pestle on the red roots
Take the roots from the bowl and drop them on the sieve
Shake the sieve and take the bowl with powder from underneath the sieve
Put the powder in the empty bowl on top of the little burner
Light the little burner with your box of matches
Now we are going to mix some paint to get the correct colors to paint the blank stones of the painting in the temple
Before you touch anything study the little burner first
Notice the two metal pipes leading down from the top
Also notice that each of these pipes has a metal tap
Both metal taps can be opened and closed
Finally notice that there is a circular valve halfway the little burner
With the painting in mind you know that we have to make dark blue paint bright blue paint dark yellow paint and bright yellow paint
On the next images pay attention to the position of the taps
Only with the use of these taps you determine the color that you get
Turn the circular valve on the little burner to get a bowl of dark blue paint
Take the bowl of paint
The bowl of dark blue paint Turn both of the taps to open them
Turn the circular valve on the little burner to get a bowl of bright yellow paint
Take the bowl of paint
The bowl of bright yellow paint Turn the left tap to close it
Turn the circular valve on the little burner to get a bowl of bright blue paint
Take the bowl of paint
The bowl of bright blue paint Turn the left tap to open it and turn the right tap to close it
Turn the circular valve on the little burner to get a bowl of dark yellow paint
Take the bowl of paint
The bowl of dark yellow paint When finished head back to the bas relief in the temple
Use the bowl of dark blue paint on the upper blank stone
Use the bowl of yellow orange paint on the one but upper blank stone
Use the bowl of light blue paint on the right blank stone
Use the bowl of orange paint on the bottom blank stone
It should look like this now The fully painted bas relief Place the bronze medallion in the eye of the Dragon
You'll pick up a priceless blue Atlantean crystal from the water basin beneath the painting
Don't forget to take back the bronze medallion from the Dragon's eye
Turn around and walk to the opposite wall
Click twice with the bronze medallion on the trident
Turn to the right and walk towards the opened panel in the wall
Place the Atlantean crystal at the left side of the panel to activate it

Turn the ring beneath the torch three times
Turn around and notice the raised column
Now remember your dad's words that you have to climb nine steps
Notice the tiles in the floor in front of this column
In order to leave this room you have to raise nine columns by pressing the tiles in front of this column in the correct order
Now remember the words in your dad's torn out page quot Then in her gaze appear fantastic images quot Look around and notice heads of a bull quot I see precious stones that light the way to truth quot Notice that burning torches light the room quot I see a flaming tentacle quot a tentacle has sides quot I see a trident of orichalcus quot a trident has fingers quot and lastly I see a big ship quot that is just ship Label the tiles like this Number the tiles from the left to the right to
Notice that the leftmost tile is hardly visible
Also notice that the fourth tile has a dark brown square
Here we go Press the dark brown square of the fourth tilePress the dark brown square of the eighth tilePress the dark brown square of the fifth tilePress the dark brown square of the third tilePress the dark brown square of the first tile If you have done this correct all nine columns are up forming a staircase leading up
Go up these stairs
Look up to see a bull's head above the grate
Use the iron bar on the bull's left horn
Walk forward
Look to the left and notice the big rock rising up in the sky with a huge red crystal on top of it
Notice that Elliot is standing behind some sort of panel high up that rock
Finally notice that the bridge towards that rock has been destroyed and is hanging down the rock
So there is no way to reach the bastard
Walk towards the Ark
Enter the Ark
Turn to the left and examine the huge standing green crystal
Turn to the right and go forward
Turn to the left and place the blue crystal on the panel
Now you have to make a blue connection from the upper right spot to the bottom left spot
Alas this isn't as simple as it looks
You'll find a fearsome opponent in Elliot
Each time you make a move in blue this bastard makes a contra move in red
I can't give you the exact solution to this puzzle because the way Elliot reacts to your moves is different every time
Below you find an example
This is not just an example
With me it worked out of times
If you fail just press the red arrow to the right to give it another try
Good luck
One more click to go Once you have succeeded the road to Atlantis gets revealed
Greedy Elliot of course wants to see the road to Atlantis
While he's standing on the edge of the rock he get's struck by a falling rock and off he goes o
What a shame
In the meantime Kate starts drawing a map of this revealing road to Atlantis
But before she's finished the whole place falls apart and they have to run for their lives
The Ark disappears buried with tons of rock taking it's secrets of it's origins with it
But the quest for Atlantis isn't over yet
Back at the New York State Building thanks to the map Kate drew they find a new lead
From the incomplete map Kate has made mister Foster recognizes that the symbol fits clearly to an image in one of his books in his collection

Turn to the left and notice the white beam that points to the pillar next to you
See the square on the upper part of the pillar
Open that square and take the bas relief and
The opened square now captain Blackwood shows who and what he really is
He not only steals the bas relief but also knocks you unconscious
And not only that
He also locks you into a sarcophagus that cannot be opened just like that
A room with a view When you study the stone tablet you seen discover that this actually is a pre historic Sudoka puzzle
Just keep on clicking on the upper left empty square
You'll see that it has nine different images
When you do this with another empty square you'll see the same nine different images in the same order
So this means that each and every image represents a cipher
With the button on top of the puzzle you can reset the whole puzzle
Press that button
In the next table I give you the complete solution to this Sudoka puzzle
With the numbers I tell you how many times you have to press an empty square on each and every row from the left to the right
So where I say in the first row it means that you have to press the first empty square on the first row seven times the second empty square three times the third empty square eight times the fourth empty square five times and the fifth empty square six times
Here we go
first row second row third row fourth row fifth row sixth row seventh row eighth row ninth row And here you can see how it should look like
One click on the right bottom square will finish the job
When you have done this correctly the sarcophagus opens and you'll pop out

Turn to the right and go further up
In front of the temple turn to the right and pick up four
stones
Turn to the left and walk to the right side of the temple
Use the hoe on the green plant
Pick up the red roots
Turn around and go one step forward
Turn to the right and enter the temple
Examine everything you can
Look at the blue yellow painting on the wall
As Kate explains this bas relief represents the Dragon of Marduk
Notice that four stones of the bas relief are missing
Also notice that the seize of the missing stones is different
Now remember that you just picked up four stones in front of the temple
That can't be no coincidence
First we are going to measure the seize of each missing stone
Place the grille over the empty upper square
The seize of this missing stone is x
Take back the grille and place it over the empty one but upper square
The seize of this missing stone is x
Take back the grille and place it over the empty right square
The seize of this missing stone is x
Take back the grille and place it over the empty left square
The seize of this missing stone is x too
Take back the grille
Taking measures Exit the temple
Turn to the right and go down the path
You are facing the beehive again
Light the smoker with the box of matches
Use the smoking smoker on the beehive to scare away the bees
Remove the roof from the beehive
Look how cute all those bees
Well believe me you can't see no bee for days when you finished this puzzle
Your goal is to get all yellow bees from the left to the right and all the orange bees from the right to the left by using the smoking smoker
The main thing is that you leave enough room for the bees to jump forward
I numbered the front row of yellow bees Y the second row of yellow bees Y and the back row of yellow bees Y
With the orange bees I did the same but changed the Y for an O
So I numbered them O O and O
Here we go Y O O Y Y Y O O O Y Y Y O Y Put away the smoker and click on the beehive
Surprise
Get your smoker again and here we go again Y O O Y Y Y O O O O Y Y Y Y O O O O Y Y Y O O Y Put away the smoker and click on the beehive
Surprise
Get your smoker one more time and here we go for the last time Y O O Y Y Y O O O O Y Y Y Y Y O O O O O Y Y Y Y Y O O O O Y Y Y O Y Put away the smoker
Take the center frame full of honey from the beehive

Turn around and go up the path between the two brick walls
You are standing between the beehives again
Turn around and take the plant
The plant and the snake While you take the plant you will be bitten by a snake
The venom of this snake is fatal
It's good you traded your pearl to theherb poultice with that herbalist
If not you would be dead by now
Head back to the village and walk to the well
Place the bucket with handle on the hook above the well

Talk to him and exhaust all dialogs
Exit the house
Turn to the left and go forward once
Pan to the left and look down the yellow floor outside the workshop
I'm sure the pattern on the floor will ring a bell
Remember you measured the missing stones of the painting in the temple
Also remember that you picked up four big stones in front of the temple
We are going to chop those four stones one by one to the correct seize
First we are going to make the biggest missing stone with the seize of x
Drop one of the stones for cutting on the floor
Use your stonecutter's tool twice on the stone
One stone x Pick up the cut stone
Drop the next stone for cutting on the floor
Now we are going to cut the one but biggest missing stone with the seize of x
Drop one of the stones for cutting on the floor
Use your stonecutter's tool four times on the stone
Pick up the cut stone
Now we are going to make the two smallest stone with the seize of x each
Drop another stone for cutting on the floor
Use your stonecutter's tool seven times on the stone
Pick up the cut stone
Drop the last stone for cutting on the floor
Use your stonecutter's tool seven times on this stone too
Pick up the cut stone
Now you should have four cut stones in your inventory
They should look like this Four correctly seized stones Turn to the left and go forward twice
Go up the path between the two brick walls and head back to the temple
Enter the temple
Don't do what captain Blackwood tells you yet
But keep in mind his words that you have to place the bronze medallion in the trident
Walk to the bas relief on the wall
Place the four cut stones into the appropriate empty squares
Great nothing happens
They do fit nicely but Well that is because the colors are missing
Head back to the village
Enter the workshop
Place the sieve over the bowl next to the little burner
Take the pestle from the bowl next to it
Put the red roots in the bowl
Use the pestle on the red roots
Take the roots from the bowl and drop them on the sieve
Shake the sieve and take the bowl with powder from underneath the sieve
Put the powder in the empty bowl on top of the little burner
Light the little burner with your box of matches
Now we are going to mix some paint to get the correct colors to paint the blank stones of the painting in the temple
Before you touch anything study the little burner first
Notice the two metal pipes leading down from the top
Also notice that each of these pipes has a metal tap
Both metal taps can be opened and closed
Finally notice that there is a circular valve halfway the little burner
With the painting in mind you know that we have to make dark blue paint bright blue paint dark yellow paint and bright yellow paint
On the next images pay attention to the position of the taps
Only with the use of these taps you determine the color that you get
Turn the circular valve on the little burner to get a bowl of dark blue paint
Take the bowl of paint
The bowl of dark blue paint Turn both of the taps to open them
Turn the circular valve on the little burner to get a bowl of bright yellow paint
Take the bowl of paint

Turn the circular valve on the little burner to get a bowl of dark yellow paint
Take the bowl of paint
The bowl of dark yellow paint When finished head back to the bas relief in the temple
Use the bowl of dark blue paint on the upper blank stone
Use the bowl of yellow orange paint on the one but upper blank stone
Use the bowl of light blue paint on the right blank stone
Use the bowl of orange paint on the bottom blank stone
It should look like this now The fully painted bas relief Place the bronze medallion in the eye of the Dragon
You'll pick up a priceless blue Atlantean crystal from the water basin beneath the painting
Don't forget to take back the bronze medallion from the Dragon's eye
Turn around and walk to the opposite wall
Click twice with the bronze medallion on the trident
Turn to the right and walk towards the opened panel in the wall

Enter the opened wall
Turn to the right and take the piece of paper out of Elliot's bag
Read the torn out page
It turns out to be a page written by your father
This page gives you some vital information
I'll mention that later
Walk to the back wall
Remove the fake bottom medallion from the socket
Place your bronze medallion in return
Oops Elliot pops out of one of the tombs and jumps to the horn of a bull's head to activate a trap
You will be trapped down below in a room with a large grate on top
No way to escape from this room at the moment
Talk to Elliot who is standing in the room above

Turn to the right and examine the extinguished torch on the wall
Talk to Kate and ask for her scarf
Put the scarf on the torch
Light the torch with your box of matches
Remember the words on your dad's torn out page quot Three times she turns a serpent that adorns her finger quot
Turn the ring beneath the torch three times
Turn around and notice the raised column
Now remember your dad's words that you have to climb nine steps
Notice the tiles in the floor in front of this column
In order to leave this room you have to raise nine columns by pressing the tiles in front of this column in the correct order
Now remember the words in your dad's torn out page quot Then in her gaze appear fantastic images quot Look around and notice heads of a bull quot I see precious stones that light the way to truth quot Notice that burning torches light the room quot I see a flaming tentacle quot a tentacle has sides quot I see a trident of orichalcus quot a trident has fingers quot and lastly I see a big ship quot that is just ship Label the tiles like this Number the tiles from the left to the right to
Notice that the leftmost tile is hardly visible
Also notice that the fourth tile has a dark brown square
Here we go Press the dark brown square of the fourth tilePress the dark brown square of the eighth tilePress the dark brown square of the fifth tilePress the dark brown square of the third tilePress the dark brown square of the first tile If you have done this correct all nine columns are up forming a staircase leading up
Go up these stairs
Look up to see a bull's head above the grate
Use the iron bar on the bull's left horn
Walk forward
Look to the left and notice the big rock rising up in the sky with a huge red crystal on top of it
Notice that Elliot is standing behind some sort of panel high up that rock
Finally notice that the bridge towards that rock has been destroyed and is hanging down the rock
So there is no way to reach the bastard
Walk towards the Ark
Enter the Ark
Turn to the left and examine the huge standing green crystal
Turn to the right and go forward
Turn to the left and place the blue crystal on the panel
Now you have to make a blue connection from the upper right spot to the bottom left spot
Alas this isn't as simple as it looks
You'll find a fearsome opponent in Elliot
Each time you make a move in blue this bastard makes a contra move in red
I can't give you the exact solution to this puzzle because the way Elliot reacts to your moves is different every time
Below you find an example
This is not just an example
With me it worked out of times
If you fail just press the red arrow to the right to give it another try
Good luck
One more click to go Once you have succeeded the road to Atlantis gets revealed
Greedy Elliot of course wants to see the road to Atlantis
While he's standing on the edge of the rock he get's struck by a falling rock and off he goes o
What a shame
In the meantime Kate starts drawing a map of this revealing road to Atlantis
But before she's finished the whole place falls apart and they have to run for their lives
The Ark disappears buried with tons of rock taking it's secrets of it's origins with it

quot In my dream I see the Queen of Atlantis climb nine steps and sit on her throne
She turns her eyes towards me
She says she will free me from the shadows that imprison me
Three times she turns a bronze serpent that adorns her finger
Then in her gaze appear fantastic images
I see precious stones that light the way to truth
I see a flaming pentacle the symbol of a benign sun
I see a trident of orichalcus And lastly a big ship the sole vestige of a forgotten past
In the grip of these visions I in my turn climb the nine steps
The Queen stands and smiles on me
I am free quot
Take note to see if what is in the text can be seen around here

Yours is blue
Find the route to Atlantis Study the puzzle and see blue end circles and red circles
The aim is to make a blue path from top right to bottom left
This is a random puzzle and no saves can be done after the completion of the puzzle
If you fail another chance to replay can be done by clicking the continue red arrow on the screen
Each click to make a blue hexagon is countered by a red hexagon made by Elliot
One tactic is to not necessarily make blue adjacent hexagons but skip one or to divert the red hexagons
Be sure that a path can be made from one to next blue tile later or the skipped hexagons can be clicked on later
This is an example take note that the cursor is about to fill in a skipped hexagon that is not the end one to the blue circle
After completing the puzzle see that the big globe starts to show the path to get to Atlantis
See it go out of northeast of North America to Europe to South America and to Africa
Elliot tries to see the rotating globe and gets hit by a rock to fall off into the abyss
Watch the cave in before Kate finishes copying the map
Watch Kate Howard and Blackwood meet with Foster in New York Howard thinks about his father that might still be alive
All is not lost Foster notices the similarity of Kate's partial map to a drawing in a book he has in his collection

I'm sure that by trying harder
This would make Saturnin clam up and you need to make brandy to give him

If the cat is 'still wary' depending on previous choices and the gauges or no milk was given to cat before use gloves on Valdo and then take the medallion from the cat
And the path of power will open before you Find the entrance to the secret passage to the King's castle
There are ways to get to the secret passage Both ways should be prepared so do both and below but heed the warning on

One way is to break the bricked wall using the cannon
Prepare gunpowder Go to the lab bench in the study
Place charcoal on mortar and use pestle to getcharcoal powder
Mix in the right bowl saltpetre sulphur and powdered charcoal
Takepowder
Prime the cannon Go down to the cellar and open the lid at right end of the cannon
Be sure that you have already placed the cannonball inside the cannon
Place the powder in the slot
Warning If you want to see another alternative path later make a saved game and do not fire the cannon yet You can replay to do the other alternative
If you want to open the brick wall now light the powder using the lighter
You can still get to the end

By elevator
Red amp yellow balls elevator puzzle Go back to the workshop and close the formerly leaning door to access the metal cabinet
Open the door and see circular metal plate that has red and yellow colored balls around the perimeter
At the center are superimposed circles that are stationary
At the bottom are cups left is red and right is yellow
On the right is a weight that turns the rotating plate
The object of the puzzle is to alternate dropping a red and a yellow ball to their respective cups
The smaller left circle receives balls from the pipe or from the ones around the edge of the big rotating plate
It has yellow buttons the top turns the circle clockwise and the bottom button turns it counterclockwise
At the bottom of the smaller circle is the path that drops the unused balls back to the edge of the rotating circle
The right larger circle also has buttons top button turns it counterclockwise and bottom to turn clockwise
There is a path to drop at the bottom and this is where the selected balls are dropped alternating to right or left cups
The circles have places that overlap each other
These are the places that the ball on the left circle can be moved by the right circle
The bottom overlap hole is where you want to position the selected colored ball to drop to the cup
The green button at bottom left resets the puzzle or empties the cups
First check which color of ball is dropped to the cups
Then reset if dropped on wrong cup
While the big plate is stationary move the correct balls from the left circle so that the right circle can drop it to the correct cup
When out of balls on the left circle to work on pull down the weight to drop balls to the smaller circle and simultaneously moving the left to get balls and right circle to select balls and drop them in the cup
Do these pull the weight and drop correct colored balls until the bowls at the bottom automatically empties
This means the puzzle is completed
Pull the lever on the right to raise the elevator
BALL DROPPING PUZZLE SOLUTION by Robert Ellison Here's how the thing works
There's no set order of collecting the balls except as mentioned below
Each time a ball drops to a cup it goes into the opposite cup than the last one so if you get out of sync you will be dropping balls in the cup opposite the one it should go into
If even one ball drops into the wrong cup then you have to empty them and start over
To empty them from the cups and start over click on the round green button on the bottom left of the puzzle
This routes the balls from the two cups back into the pipe at the top of the big wheel which feeds them back into the big wheel
Note the little paddle like gizmo at the intersection where the ball goes left or right
The long piece of the divider points to the cup which will NOT get the next ball
Whether you first drop a red or yellow ball depends on the position of the divider indicator when you begin dropping balls into the cups
Where the two little circles of ball holders are located the top left yellow button rotates the little wheel on the left clockwise and the one under it rotates it counterclockwise
The top right yellow button rotates the little wheel on the right counterclockwise and the one under it rotates it clockwise
Dropping balls into the downward slot on the left sends them back to the rotating outer wheel for quot recycling quot
The slot on the right drops them into the cup in the sequence
It is easier and less confusing to quot capture quot two or three balls at a time and of course in order if you can
If you cannot get them in the proper order then use the two small rotating wheels to sort them into their proper order and according to how the indicator at the quot separating quot point is set
Any out of order can be dropped back into the big wheel until needed
After collecting three or four balls it might help to wait until the big wheel stops turning so you can concentrate on which button moves what to where
Then you can restart the big wheel collect three or four more and do it all again until the puzzle is done and you can pull the big lever on the right to operate the ldquo lift ldquo elevator
Start the puzzle by pulling the handle hanging from a chain on the right
Elevator Enter the elevator and pull the lever to go down
Across the elevator is the metal cabinet to raise or bring down the elevator

The Secrets of Da Vinci The Forbidden Manuscript A Walkthrough by ZURREEN ZUBAIRIE Copyright All rights reserved
Please note that this walkthrough is copyrighted Hence anyattempt to reproduceanythingfrom this walkthrough will beseverelypunished to themaximumextent of the law
The Walkthrough GENERALLY For those of you who might be concerned this game has nothing to do with quot The Da Vinci Code quot bookormovie Rather it is just a very intriguing quite non controversial and apparently fictitious story about a youngman who has been hired anonymously to retrieve an invaluable manuscript left behind by the great Leonardo Da Vinci The story line is wonderful the graphics are superb and the quest as well as the puzzles are quite clever and engaging In short this is a game that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for some good clean fun with the touch of a nice intellectual challenge
As for the dynamics of the game itself This is a point and click game In addition please note the following about the Inventory Page that you can access at any time during the game by right clicking i e clicking on the right button of your mouse
The quot Conscience quot Gauge This is undoubtedly the most important dynamic in the game
As explained in the game booklet some of the actions you carry out would have a quot good quot or quot bad quot impact on this gauge depending on how you choose to accomplish a given objective You need to strive for a balance if you are too quot Angelic quot you would not be able to carry out at least some bad things that you might have to do similarly you can't afford to be too quot Diabolic quot either For my part I have taken the quot Angelic quot approach for the most part using bonus points to keep the Conscience gauge balanced But don't worry ndash you will have more bonus points than you will ever need in this game in no time at all In the following walkthrough I have pointed out at least some of the quot Diabolic quot actions that you can take If you decide to try them however please keep in mind that doing so does have at least some unpleasant consequences although none of these consequences will prevent you from doing well and finishing the game
The Diary You will find this particular notebook under the hero's portrait in the right hand portion of the Inventory Page It contains virtually all the information you need about the story the description of the place characters and events It even gives you a checklist of things to do and once you have accomplished a given task that task even gets crossed out in the list Be sure to check out the diary at the very beginning of the game The sooner you can get a hang of using it the more useful it will prove to be later Here is how to use the Diary Click on the Diary in the Inventory Page to access it Note the four arrows or rather the arrowheads at the bottom of the screen You can click on the two arrows in the middle to flip through the pages two pages at a time or you can click on the arrows in the extreme left or right the ones with a vertical dash each on their point i e I lt or gt I to immediately get to the firstorthe last two pages skipping everything in the middle The box with all the arrows would be grayed out at the beginning of the game of course because there are only two pages in the diary at that time Right click click on the right button on the mouse ORclick on theExiticon the circular combined image of the Sun and the Moon at the lower right hand corner of the screen to return to the Inventory Page
The Portfolio This is the large notebook you see in the top center of the screen It will contain all the documents you collect in the game In addition any document that you produce or reproduce in any way will at first appear among the various objects in your inventory as a quot sheet to be added to the portfolio quot You would therefore have to click on this quot sheet quot and then on the Portfolio in order for the sheet to be attached to the Portfolio as a document Here is how to use the Portfolio
Click on the Portfolio to access it A close up of the notebook would be presented to you Note that there aretwosets of four arrows each on this page ndash one to therightof the Portfolio and the other to the right of the black box the quot Text Field quot underthe Portfolio Use the four arrows to the right of the Portfolio above the Exit image to flip through thedocumentscollected in the game The two arrows in the first row I lt or gt I take you to the first and the last document respectively while the two plain arrows lt or gt in the second row allow you to flip through the documents two pages at a time Once you have the document you would like to check out click on it in the Portfolio and a close up of that document will be presented to you Click on this close up and thetextof this document will appear in the Text Field under the document's close up Use the four arrows arranged vertically to the right of the Text Field box to read through the text Once again the plain arrows in the middle move you through the text a few lines at a time Use the outer arrows I lt or gt I to zoom to the beginning or the end of the document
Finally it would be a good idea to organize your Inventory from time to time because that really makes it much easier to locate the items you need Well that is all I can think of in terms of a general guide to the game Following is a more detailed step by step walkthrough Please feel free to address any comments or questions about this walkthrough toZSZUBAIRIE AOL com
Day ndash The Night of September You arrive at the Cloux Manor at Amboise property of Fran ois I King of France This is where Leonardo Da Vinci died three years ago The manor is currently inhabited by Madam Marie Babou de la Bourdaisi re your hostess You are ushered to your room by Saturnin the guardian of the manor
As the controls of the game are returned to you read the two pages of the Diary first Exit the Diary and then read the two documents already collected in your portfolio While the first document gives you some information not already given in the opening cutscene the second document gives you even more new information
Exit the Portfolio and the Inventory pages Turn slightly to your left and examine both the drawers in the chest of drawers Retrieve theDoubletfrom the top drawer and theBrandyfrom the drawer under it Feel free to don this doublet now or later when your meeting with the hostess is imminent As explained in the booklet you would put on the doublet by opening your Inventory and clicking first on the doublet and then on the hero's portrait in the upper right hand corner of the screen
Step towards the table under the window to your right Open its drawer and retrieve theKnifeand theCharcoal Crayon We are done in this room So turn left and step out of the room Turn around and look at the large rug hanging on the wall behind you There is no icon on it so we can ignore it for now
Turn around again and go down the stairs arriving in what we will call the Pantry If you pan the camera around you will see sacks of food and other goodies in this room But there is no icon right now to allow you to take anything Look down and note the stairs leading to another room below with an open door indicating a route out of the house But there is no reason either to go down or out of the house yet So just turn around and enter the Kitchen through the door facing the stairs you had used to come down
As you enter the Kitchen pick up theBottle of MilkandOilfrom the table in front of you Step forward turn left and pick up anEggfrom the other end of the same table Note the food dish down on the floor to the left of the table Pan the camera further to your left and you will see a black cat sitting on the floor to the right of the door you see there Click on the cat and listen to the hero's comment Turn back around to the table and feel free to put some milk in the food dish on the floor i e click on the Bottle of Milk in your inventory exit the inventory and then click on the food dish Now step in the cat's direction and turn around to see the cat drinking the milk out of the dish A quot Use quot or gear icon appears on the cat but nothing happens if you click on this icon Apparently the only purpose for feeding the cat is to befriend it and this is the only time in the game that you would be able to do so This act of kindness on your part also raises your Angelic level
Turn to the table on your left You can try to pick up the knife lying on the table but the hero will not pick it up because he has quot got one already quot The extra knife is no doubt provided just in case a gamer missed the one in the hero's room
Step towards the door on the left of this table and step through it to enter the Great Hall It is actually the dining room but we will call it the Great Hall because it will be referred to as such much later in the game
Pan the camera slightly to your left and pick up theBottle of Watersitting on the dining table in front of you Now step towards the door to the left of the table If you go through this door however you will enter a corridor where the door to the right is closed at this time Butthatis the area we want to explore next ndash what we will call the Workshop So let's ignore the door leading to that corridor for now and use the other entrance from the Dining Room to the Workshop the door to therightof this one
As we thus enter the Workshop we find that the left half of the room is shrouded in darkness Even if you click on the arrows pointing to the dark side of the room the hero will refuse to go there because of the darkness reminding us instead of our immediate objective to find Leonardo's Study Note the hero says that the Study must be on the quot First Floor quot This is actually European terminology whereby the floor we are on would be called theground floorand the quot First Floor quot actually refers to the one upstairs
But let us do a little exploring around the Workshop so long as we are here So pan the camera to your right and pick up theStickleaning against the table to your right Pick up theLinkfrom the floor to the left of where the Stick was standing Step towards the area lit by the candle in front of you Note the sawing table on your right and the drilling equipment on your left Note also that both the crank and the drill bit in the drilling area canbe removed But leave them alone for now because you will just have to put them back again when you use the equipment later
Turn to the sawing table Bring out the Stick from your Inventory and click on the gear icon on the top of the table to place the Stick in front of the sawing blade Next look under the table and click on the machine's foot pedal on the floor The sawing begins but nothing is happening to your Stick Don't worry Look at the top of the table again and click on the Stick now to move it against the blade and saw the Stick in half Pick upbothpieces of the Stick which will now be labeled as quot Small Stick quot in your Inventory
We are done in this room ndash for now so step back out in the Dining Room Step forward and use the door on your right now to step into the corridor that we had ignored earlier Turn left and step forward to arrive in a small hallway with a set of stairs leading up to the First Floor Take a step up the stairs turn around and look down to find a quot Collar quot necklace on the landing area between the two flights of stairs Pick up the collar wait for the hero to finish his comment and then take another step up the stairs to reach the First Floor
As you arrive on this floor you can turn left and step forward to enter a rather dimly lit area But there is nothing of interest here So go back out and enter the corridor to therightof the stairs you had used to reach this floor Look to the right of the corridor but there is no arrow allowing you to go further in this direction at this time So enter the room to your left This is what the hero calls Leonardo's room For the sake of clarification however we will refer to it as Leonardo's Bedroom But it is Leonardo'sStudythat we still need to locate and according to the hero it must be near
Look at the bed to your left Note the symbol of a triangle at the top of the left bed post Even if you can't actually see it just move your cursor slowly around over the square block forming the top of the bed post until a magnifying glass icon appears Click on the glass icon and listen to the hero's comment about the triangular symbol quot sign quot but we don't have enough information just yet to figure out what that symbol means Note a similar triangular symbol at the top of the right bed post as well
Feel free to click on the two paintings on the walls on either side of the door you had used to enter the room Turn around then and step forward to the tall bookcase across the room Again feel free to click on the two paintings on either side of this bookcase Note the markings in the center justabovethe bookcase Click on the magnifying glass icon appearing on these markings and the hero will read quot The path of pleasures quot Hmmm hellip Turn left and step forward to find yourself facing another door Click on it and listen to the hero's comment Click on the painting of St John the Baptist hanging on the wall to the right of the door Turn left of the door step forward to face yet another door But this one is of no interest So look at the bed on your left and check out the triangular symbols on the top of the bedposts onthisside of the bed Next turn to the small table to the right of the bed and pick up theSheet of Paper If you try to pick up theCharcoal Crayonlying next to that sheet however the hero will refuse to take it because you already have one ndash the one you got from the drawer in your room So just turn to the large table to the right of the door and pick up theMirror Feel free again to click on the painting above the table
Open your Inventory click on the Sheet of Paper and then click on the Portfolio to attach the sheet to the Portfolio You will be presented with a close up of the sheet you just attached it is the one that appears as the right page in the close up Note the strange markings on this sheet Click on the blackCharcoal Crayon in the middle circular slot to the right of the Portfolio Now click first in the top half and then in the bottom half of the sheet with the mysterious markings A shading will be drawn across the page revealing an inscription in white but it will be illegible Click on the page but the Text Field below will also call it quot Illegible Text quot Release the crayon by right clicking and pick up theMirror from the top slot to the right of the Portfolio and then click on the shaded sheet again You will now be able to read the text of the sheet but only in the Text Field under the Portfolio Feel free to put away the mirror just right click your mouse as you scroll through this text It is a message from Leonardo to Francesco presenting him withtwo riddlesthe solution to which would enable one to find or make the necessary keys
After you finish reading the message use the arrows on therightof the Portfolio to turn the page Note the four triangles on the left page These are the same signs we saw on the top of the bedposts There is some kind of writing under each triangle but you can't read it off the page and if you click on the magnifying glass icon appearing on this writing the Text Field would also call it Illegible Text So use the Mirror on the right of the Portfolio again and the Text Field will tell you the meaning of these triangles Thus click on the writing under each triangle one by one and find theSymbol of the element Fire theSymbol of the element Air theSymbol of the element Water and theSymbol of the element Earth
Go to the other side of the bed now the one next to the door you had used to enter this room Click on the magnifying glass icon on theleftbed post first and the hero says quot The sign for air quot Now click on the magnifying glass icon on therightbed post and the hero says quot The sign for fire quot The hero thenautomaticallyquotes a line from Leonardo's message indicating we have solved hissecondriddle The camera willautomaticallypan down to the floor and focus on the corner of a carpet at the foot of the bed Click on the gear icon appearing on that corner of the carpet to flip it back and reveal a white rectangular panel in the floor underneath Use your knife on this panel i e open your Inventory click on the Knife close the Inventory and then click on the white panel to remove it from the floor and reveal something hidden inside Click on the hand icon to retrieve anotherSheet of Paperand aKey Mould
Open your Inventory and attach the new sheet to the Portfolio A close up of this sheet will now be presented to you Click on the writing that appears at the bottom of the page but it is quot Illegible Text quot again So use the Mirror again on the writing reading the Text Field to learn about quot Bronze a metal used for casting statues as well as for ordinary objects such as keys quot and how it is quot an alloy of copper and tin quot Turn the page now and decipher the writing in the middle of the left page using the Mirror and the Text Field again to learn a little aboutthe properties of gold and how gold coins are molded
Feel free to go around to the other side of the bed and click on the magnifying glass icons on the top of the bedposts on that side The hero will call out the meaning of those symbols also but nothing will happen after that of course because the symbols on the first side of the bed were the only ones relevant to the riddle leading to the secret panel in the floor
We are done in this room for now All that remains is to somehow enter Leonardo's Study which westillhaven't found There aretwoways to accomplish this objective Let us try theDiabolicapproach tonight Note The Angelic approach will be discussed a little later because we would have no choice but to use it then anyway Using the Diabolic approach tonight would be advisable for two reasons First it will give you a chance to use some of the Inventory items that you would not be able to use otherwise Second you will get more bonus points for having tried both the methods of entering the Study than if you had used the same Angelic approach twice The quot downside quot of using the Diabolic approach of course is that you would then have tousesome of these bonus points to increase your Angelic level thus restoring thebalancein your Conscience gauge once again
The Diabolic Approach Step out of the bedroom turn right and enter the small hallway above the stairs Go all the way down the stairs and enter the Kitchen through the door on yourright Take two steps forward and enter the Pantry Look down on the floor to your left and go downstairs to arrive in an area that we will call the Store Room There is nothing of interest here at the moment so just step through what we will call the Store Room Exit Entrance to come outside the house Turn right step forward and then pick up theLadderlying against the wall with the large closed gates to your right
Wait for the hero to finish his comment and then turn to your right We need to reach the corner of the house to your extreme right The first arrow on your right will take you back to the Store Room Entrance from where you can turn right and step forward to arrive at the spot we are seeking But thedirectroute from the spot where you found the ladder would be to just click on thesecondarrow to your right and you will be instantly transferred to the corner of the house we want Turn around to your left now and look up at the side of the house to find a quot Specific Use quot icon two gears with a line drawn across them between the windows on the ground floor and the First Floor Bring out the Ladder from your inventory and click on the gear icon that now appears between the windows to place the ladder under the First Floor window
Step on the ladder but the cut scene shows the rungs breaking under the hero's weight Don't worry Just bring out the twoSmall Sticksfrom your Inventory one by one placing each on the Ladder to serve as rungs now Click on the arrow now appearing on the ladder to arrive in what appears to be another empty bedroom In fact this is Madam Babou's bedroom as we will learn later but she is not here at the moment
Feel free to explore the room but there is nothing of interest So step to the door on theleftof the fireplace Click on the keyhole and then on the door handle above it to open the door and then enter Leonardo's Study
This would be a good time to check your quot Conscience quot gauge The bad news is that your Angelic quot level quot has gone down but the good news is that you have bonus points Note It would have been only points if you had sawed the Stick in half onlyafterthe ladder rungs had broken Thus your foresight was actually rewarded by points
So just clickonceon the button under the Angelic gauge and your Conscience will be balanced again Your bonus points are down to of course but don't worry ndash they will be up again soon
Turn right now and approach what we will call the Lab area with the quot Still quot apparatus on your left and the desk with all the phials etc
on your right Feel free to examine the Still the boiler under it etc
but you don't need to start tinkering with any of that just yet Instead turn to the desk itself to the right of the Still Pick up theEmpty Phial of Inkand thePhial of Sulphurfrom the bottom shelf on the left side of the desk Pick up theSheet of Papersticking to the wall behind and hidden by the two phials you just removed Next pick up thePhial of Sleeping Potion from the top shelf
Open the Inventory Page attach this new Sheet of Paper to the Portfolio and use the Mirror to read the text in the upper left and lower right hand corners You will only beclickingon these positions with the Mirror of course the text itself would appear only in the Text Field under the Portfolio
The first portion of the text tells you how to makeBlack Inkand the second tells you a little bit about theSo Called Invisible Ink Turn the page then and use the Mirror to decipher the text at the top of this page as well to read a little bit about how to useDistillation to produce Brandy Perfumes and Oilsin the Text Field again
Feel free to explore the room but there is nothing else of interest at this time So when you are done return to the door you had used to enter the room Now click on what appears to be a portrait of Leonardo himself hanging on the wall to therightof this door The portrait will flip around revealing yet another Sheet of Paper sticking to its back Retrieve this Sheet and listen to the hero's comment Open the Inventory Page attach this new Sheet of Paper to the Portfolio and examine the quot Clockwork Mechanism quot ndash which is actually a puzzle you need to solve to proceed further in the game Here is how to do it
The Clockwork Puzzle Note that there are three gears in the quot clock quot at the top of the page and a lone gear at the lower left hand corner of the page Note also thesevengears of varying sizes at the very bottom of the page Click on thelonegear and it will start running Now pick up a small gear from the bottom and click around the lone running gear Note You can place a gearanywherethat the Specific Use icon doesnotappear
The objective is toattachthe new gear to the lone running gear so that the new gear would start running as well You must thus attach all seven gears from the bottom of the page one by one arranging them all the way up to the third gear sticking out of the quot clock quot When the last gear is successfully attached the clock will start running
Sit back now and watch the cutscene that marks the end of the day as well
Day ndash September As the day begins you are taken out of your room and brought out of the house through the Store Room Exit where you find yourself engaged in a conversation with Saturnin While you gain some important information you also find out that Saturnin has discovered your little quot indiscretion quot the night before You must now pay him to keep his mouth shut So open the Inventory clickonceon the coins appearing under the Diary close the Inventory and click on Saturnin to pay him that one coin A short dialog follows Feel free to click on Saturnin again to have him repeat the last part of the second dialog
If you haven't done so already put on the Doublet you had found in your room Turn around and step forward to reach the corner of the house where you had put your ladder the night before There will be no icon to allow you to put a ladder there today of course but thereisan icon on the rose bush at that corner of the house Use your Knife to pick up someRosesfrom this rose bush and then step back to the Store Room Enter the Store Room
Pick upthreehandfuls ofCharcoalfrom the sack on the floor to the left of the stairs Next pick up someSplit Logspiled up on the floor to the right of the stairs Note The hero will refuse to take more than once
Turn further to your right and grab the pair ofPliersfrom the back of the closed half of the door Go upstairs now to the Pantry Look down slightly to your left and pick upthreehandful ofGrains of Wheatfrom the sack on the floor Turn to the Kitchen door on your right and pick up theBroom leaning against the wall to the right of this door Enter the Kitchen now Turn right and pick up theThymefrom the top of the floor cabinet against the wall Step forward then turn around and pick up theLemonfrom the top of the other end of the same cabinet
Turn right and step forward going past the fireplace Turn left and step through the door to arrive in the small hallway with the set of stairs leading up to the First Floor Go all the way up the stairs turn right and step through the door to arrive in the corridor in front of Leonardo's Bedroom Turn right and note that the door on the other end of the corridor is now open You can even see a balcony outside But there is no need to go there yet So just turn around and enter Leonardo's bedroom to the left of the door you had used to enter the corridor
Step forward to your left to reach the door next to the painting of St John the Baptist Recall the first riddle in Leonardo's message from the night before telling us to quot follow Saint John the Baptist quot Note how St John's finger is pointing up Move your cursor on the upper right hand corner of the picture frame until ahandicon appears Click on the hand icon to retrieve aKey Use this key now on the keyhole to open the door to your left Enter Leonardo's Study once more Note YourConsciencegauge will not be affected by entering the Study this way I merely call this the Angelic way to contrast it with the Diabolic method we had used the night before At any rate you do gain points for using a different method this time
As you enter the Study a cutscene follows You finally get to meet Madam Babou In addition to some helpful information she gives you a couple of tasks to perform for her She even gives you anEngraved Plate just before retrieving theLetter of Introductionfrom you As the cutscene ends feel free to click on her again but she is not in the mood of chatting anymore at least at the moment Recall Saturnin's last words about trying to soften the lady's heart with words and gifts So give her theCollar necklace that you had found on the stairs the night before Another short dialogue follows but if you click on her again you realize that it would not be so easy to persuade this lady to let you visit her apartments where you hope to find some critical clues to your actual quest Try to give her theRosesyou had just clipped outside but she is not pleased by the fact that you cut her roses No harm in having tried though
Turn right and pick up theLyreleaning against the wall under the window Turn further right and pick up theEmpty Bowl actually a tea cup and theEmpty Perfume Bottle from the small round table in front of the couch
Step towards the lab area then Click on the small cupboard to your right above the table and listen to the hero's comment about making a key from the mold you found the night before Turn around and return to Madam Babou now seated on the couch As you approach her she compliments you on the Doublet you are wearing You are given a choice of two possible responses Feel free to pick either one because neither will affect your Conscience gauge or award you with bonus points and the lady will give you the same information in return no matter how you respond to her compliment As she finishes feel free to click on her again to have her repeat the information she just gave you but it will now be delivered as separate responses to the four choices presented to you
Turn right then and step into Leonardo's bedroom Step forward and turn left to face the tall bookcase against the wall Click on the markings above the bookcase The hero will first repeat the phrase from the night before quot The path of pleasures quot and then notes that the room he slept in the night before must be right behind this bookcase Note that you also get a gear icon on each of the books today In fact this is another puzzle and the hero's remark is actually a clue to the solution which is as follows
The Bookcase Puzzle You must click on the books so as to spell out the name of the person Babou mentioned in her last statement SALAI Here are the books you need to press
S ndash the fourth book from the left in the middle shelf A ndash the fourth book from the right in the top shelf L ndash the third book from the right in the bottom shelf A ndash the fifth book from the right in the bottom shelf I ndash the fourth book from the left in the top shelf Note It really doesn't matter which quot A quot you pick first All that matters is to get the spelling of the name right In this connection note that quot I quot i Note also that you must click a little to therightof the book you would like to press in order for the right one to go in
As you click on the last book a short cutscene shows the opening of a passage You find yourself on the other side back in front of your room Note When you go back to Leonardo's bedroom you will find that the bookcase still appears as before but there is an arrow on it now allowing you to go through Thus from now on you can use this route as a shortcut to your own room without having to tinker with the books again Unfortunately however there is no such shortcut to get back in Leonardo's bedroom If you turn around and look at the wall rug you will see a gear icon on it However when you click on it the hero notes that the quot passage must also open on this side quot but that he will quot take care of that later quot SeeThe Bookcase Puzzle ndash much later on Day
Go down to the Pantry and enter the Kitchen We need to go to the Workshop now but let's try a different route than the one we used the night before So as you enter the Kitchen take two steps forward to enter the small hallway with the stairs leading up to the First Floor Turn right and step forward to find yourself in a corridor The Dining Room is on your right and another door leading out of the house is now open on your left For the sake of clarification we will call this the Main Entrance Exit because it is the only one we will find in this game that can properly be called as such
We are not leaving the house just yet so keep going forward in the corridor The next step brings you into another small hallway Feel free to click on the wall painting to your right Click on the double doors to your left only to find them locked Step forward now to enter the Workshop
As you enter you find yourself facing a Press The hero will automatically indicate the machine's purpose but there is no need to start tinkering with it just yet Instead look down on the floor and pick up theGear which looks like a ship's helm or a rimless wheel with spokes sticking out so for the sake of clarification we will call this the quot wheel like Gear quot Turn left and approach the fireplace Moving left to right on the mantel pick up theIron Box theLighter and a thickDrill Bit There is also aSheet of Paperstuck on the wall above the mantel but you must use your pair ofPlierson the sheet to pick it up You thus get both the sheet and theNailthat had pinned it to the wall Open your Inventory then and attach this Sheet of Paper to the Portfolio to find a diagram on some kind of waterworks In fact this is a puzzle that you must solve in order to provide Madam Babou with her fountain Here is how to do it
The Waterworks Puzzle Note Please don't be overwhelmed by the following instructions It is actually much easier to solve this puzzle than to describe the solution itself Moreover be sure to look at the Diagram following these instructions and you will see just how simple it all really is With that in mind begin by moving your cursor which is in the form of a gear icon right now on the various parts of the diagram and noting the name of each part in the Text Field Thus we find Water Pump Jack linked to a system of communicating pools Archimedes Screw a device for pumping water Hydraulic Press Click on theWater Pumpand the water will come out of the pump and quot flood quot the whole page Click on theJack and it will be connected to theWater Pump Click on theWater Pumpnow and this time the water will go all the way to theArchimedes Screw Click on thisScrew and the water will go to theHydraulic Press Click on theHydraulic Press and the water will move up and quot flood quot your whole page again But note how this happened There is a horizontal line with two vertical lines on either end in the upper portion of the diagram There are two breaks or gaps in the horizontal line Thus when the water came out of the Hydraulic Press it went through these gaps in the horizontal line and flooded the page Hence we must find a way to plug up these gaps and reroute the water so that it would sprout like a fountain at the top instead of leaking from the bottom and flooding the whole page
Note the five geometric lines in the quot box quot above the Water Pump Three of these are straight double or pairs of lines which you can think of as quot pipes quot There are two curved lines also with two openings each which you can think of as quot bowls quot You must use these five geometric forms toplugthe two gaps in the broken horizontal line
In fact it will take you only ten simple clicks to do it Moreover you don't need to be precise in your placements Just click close to the areas indicated below and each line will automatically go where it is supposed to go With all this in mind here is how you place those lines Click on thetallest quot pipe quot or double line and then click on thesecond counting left to right gap in the horizontal line to place the pipeunderthat gap Click on themedium sizedpipe and then click on thefirstgap in the horizontal line and the pipe will automatically connect going halfway up through the gap
Click on theshortestpipe and then click in themiddleof the two pipes we just attached to put the shortest pipe between the other two Click on the bowl curved line that has both its two openings at the top and then clickbetweenthe tallest and the shortest pipes close to thebottomof both those pipes so that the end of the tallest pipe would appear to go through while that of the shortest pipe would only touch the bowl opening next to it This bowl will thus direct the water flow from the tallest pipe to the shortest pipe
Now click on the bowl that has one opening at the top and the other at the bottom and then click in the area between thebottomof the middle sized pipe and thetopof the shortest pipe so that the shortest pipe will appear to go through while the end of the middle sized pipe will appear to only touch the bowl opening closest to it This bowl will thus direct the water flow from the shortest pipe to the medium sized pipe
Once done your quot construction quot should look something like the following
Now let's see if it works So click on theJackfirst to connect it again to theWater Pump Then click on theWater Pump and watch the water flow up to theArchimedes Screw Click on thisScrew and the water will now go up to theHydraulic Press Click on thisPress and the water will come out of the top of the Hydraulic Press pour into the horizontal line enter the system of pipes and bowls you arranged and finally sprout out of the top of the medium sized pipe in the form of a fountain that the lady had desired
A cut scene follows after which the hero indicates that we must find the prototype of Leonardo's fountain in the barn Before we get to that however let's take care of a few things right here in the Workshop If you are still facing the mantel turn around to your left and step towards the quot crooked quot door If you click on the door knob the hero will explain that the door has come off its hinges Turn down slightly to your right to see a pair ofPlierson a small floor cabinet The hero will refuse to take these pliers however because you already have a pair in your inventory Turn further right and pick up theGearfrom the floor We will call this the quot small gear quot to distinguish it from the wheel like gear we had picked up earlier
Turn right yet further and click on the Jack sitting on a wooden box The hero notes that it doesn't work at the moment Pick up theEngraved Plate to the right of the Jack
Turn right and take two steps forward to approach the drilling machine The bit currently in place will prove to be too thin for our present purposes although you are welcome to try using it of course
So remove pick up this thinDrill Bit and replace it with the thickerDrill Bityou had retrieved from the mantel earlier Now put the wheel likeGearon the table under the drill bit and click on theCrank sticking out from the left of the drill bit holder The machine will drill a hole in your wheel like gear Pick up the wheel like nowPerforated Gear and then put your other the small Gearon the table and drill a hole in that gear as well Pick up that also nowPerforated Gear Having drilled a large enough hole in both of your gears pick up theCrankfrom the machine
Return to the crooked door and turn to the Jack on the box no pun intended all ye American fellow gamers
Put the smallPerforated Gearon the Jack and then pick up theJack
We are done in the Workshop for now so let's step outside the house through the Store Room Exit
Note There are three different ways you can go down toorcomearoundto this Exit but the simplest to explain would be to use theotherdoor to go directly into the Dining Room then go into the Kitchen and then into the Pantry down to the Store Room and out As you step out of the Store Room Exit look around to your right to find an open door now to the left of the Exit you just used This is the Barn Step inside and a cut scene follows
As the cut scene ends look at the table on your right There are several things on it that you can purchase from Saturnin Click on the table after Saturnin stops speaking and he will repeat his offer After that you will be able to click on individual objects and Saturnin will just tell you the price he is asking for that object Bring out the number of coins he wants from your Inventory and click on him to pay him that price Then just click on the object and if you have paid the right amount you would be able to pick it up However there is nothing here that we might need shortly that we cannot find or make ourselves So just turn to Saturnin's left and pick up theFountain Systemfrom the floor
Step out of the Barn Turn right step forward and pick up theLadderfrom the ground on your right Turn left then and step towards the Pool Turn right to face the Pool and place theFountain Systemin its center A cutscene will follow taking you back up to Madam Babou in Leonardo's Study Feel free to pick either one of the two choices presented in response to her compliment because neither will affect either your Conscience gauge or your bonus points Feel free also to click on the lady then and ask her to let you visit her apartments but she is quot not at all in the mood quot to allow you to do so So turn to your right and approach the lab area Click on the small boiler door below to open it and put someCharcoalinside Use theLighterthen to light up a fire and then close the boiler door again
Next remove theGooseneckconnecting the Still to the Funnel at the top of what we might call the Distillation area of the mechanism Put theRosesinto the Still it looks like a pot or a tiny cauldron and you must click in thecenterof the pot not at the top Next bring out yourBottle of Waterand click on the Still to add some water to the roses you had just put in the Still Put theGooseneckback in its place and the hero will say that something is still missing Put the rest of the water from the nowOpened Bottle of Waterinto the Funnel at the top of the distillation area The hero will indicate that the product is ready as a pink liquid trickles down into the phial at the bottom of the distillation area Bring out theEmpty Perfume Bottleand click on the phial with the distilled product to fill your bottle with the newly made perfume Return to the lady and present thisPerfume Bottle full of Rose Oilto her She will accept it graciously enough but if you click on her and ask her again to let you in her apartments she will firmly decline to do so Offer her theBrandy but she will not appreciate that There is no harm in having tried though and it does add an entry to your Diary about her
It is time now to head for that bridge that the lady had indirectly asked you to repair Take the shortcut through the bookcase in Leonardo's bedroom Go down to the Store Room and step outside the house Look to your right and find that Saturnin is back there again You can click on him and still ask him about purchasing something from him and he will take you to the Barn But as mentioned earlier there is nothing that we need from him right now Feel free to ask him about how to soften the lady's heart He will tell you to give her gifts like perfumes and flower oils but we have already done that Other than that he will tell you to just continue with gifts and compliments Turn left now and take two steps forward to reach the other end of the garden Turn right and take a step towards the coach that had brought you to the Manor the night before You will not be allowed to reach the coach itself though Instead turn left and grab the clump ofGall Nutshanging down from the big tree
Turn left then and take three steps forward to reach the unusable Bridge Note how it is anchored by two mechanical units on your left and right Pick up theIron Barsitting on the wheel like gear on top of the unit anchoring the bridge on your left Look to your right and note that a similar wheel like gear is missing from the anchoring unit on that side Bring out the wheel likePerforated Gearfrom your inventory and place it on this unit The bridge is now fixed Note that it can be moved tothreedifferent positions the present position pointing into the canal towards the first parcel of land on your left where the Dovecot is located and across the canal to the second parcel of land on your right where the Mill is located
If you look at your Diary one of your assignments is to locate the Dovecot where we are expecting a message for the hero So let's head there first Click once on the right anchoring device and then step forward on the bridge Look to your left and note the pile of logs on the ground You can pick up one of these but you cannot put it in your Inventory You can only place it on the tree stump to the right of the pile of logs But then you don't have an axe to chop up the log before you can pick up the split logs
Besides you already have some split logs and you don't need anymore just yet So ignore the pile for now turn right and take another step forward on the path in front of you
Look to your left again and note the beehive buzzing with bees Obviously it would not be a good idea to disturb these bees because you don't have any protection and if you click on the hive the hero will say so So turn right and cross another bridge which is fixed unlike the one we just repaired Pick up theSmall Logs and Twigsfrom the ground on your right and a handful ofDead Leavesfrom the ground on your left Step forward then towards the red brick building in front of you to enter the Dovecot
As you enter the camera automatically pans to a half open window on your right and then up towards what we will call the Loft As the hero finishes his comment look down to your right and pick up a handful ofPebblesfrom the ground Continuing to move to your right then pick up theCopper Objectsitting on the window sill theLong Ropehanging down from the wooden beam and the pile ofOld clotheslying on the ground
Go up to the Loft now
Note the barrel towards the edge of the Loft to your left and the patch of hay or straw on the ground to your right
But there is no need to tinker with either of these because they don't become significant until much later in the game So just pick up thePewter Dishfrom the floor on your left Then look at the six pigeonholes vertically aligned to the left of the window Pick up theCallfrom thesecondfrom the top of these pigeonholes and then bring out thisCallfrom your Inventory As you close the Inventory you will see theCallsuspended in the air in front of you inviting you to yet another puzzle
The quot Call quot Puzzle This is actually a very simple puzzle in which you must play the right notes to summon all the birds out of their holes so that we can see if any of them has a message for us Imagine as if the holes that you see on theCallwere numbered as follows ndash Play the notes in the following order Click on the thhole
Click on the rdhole
Click on the thhole
Click on the sthole
Click on the ndhole
As you play each correct note a bird will come out of its pigeonhole Miss a note andallof them will withdraw and you will have to start all over again After you have played all five notes correctly all of the birds will be out and theCallwill disappear from your view indicating that you have solved the puzzle You must now click on the magnifying glass icon appearing on each bird to check to see if it is carrying a message As you click on the fifth bird the one in the top pigeonhole in the extreme right a cut scene will follow that will show the hero reading the message sent to him and then his own response to it Note you might want to save your game just before clicking on this bird if you would like to hear these messages again because they are not reproduced in your Diary or Portfolio
We are done in the Dovecot for now so step outside and head back across the movable bridge that we had repaired Click once on the right anchoring device again to move the bridge towards the Mill on your right this time Step forward on the bridge You will find a path in front of you while the Mill is on your right Before going in the Mill however take a step forward on the path Look to your right and use yourKnifeto cut and pick up aReed There are somePebbleslying on the ground to the right of the crop of reeds but the hero will refuse to take them because you already have some
Return to the bridge now and step towards therightof the Mill Pick up theAxe leaning against the door frame to the right of the Mill's entrance You will find another batch ofDead Leaveson the ground to your left but if you try to pick some the hero will refuse to do so because you already have some in your Inventory Turn further left towards the canal Bring out yourEmpty Bottle of Waterand click on the canal to fill up your bottle with water again
Turn further left then and click on the arrow pointing into the canal itself The hero will note that you need to find something to help you breathe in there So open your Inventory click on theReedand then on the hero's portrait to put the Reed on his face Jump into the water now and look up to your left to find a tangle of twigs blocking the water wheel Use yourKnifeon this tangle to free the wheel allowing it to run again Turn further left and click on the arrow to come out of the water Open your Inventory now and remove theReed by clicking on it in the hero's portrait unless you want to hear Saturnin's quot crack quot about your appearance when you later approach him and start to move away
Turn right and enter the Mill
As you step inside note how the Mill is divided into two separate areas the actual Mill area to your right and what we might call the Forge area to your left We will need both these facilities to achieve some of our objectives Before we get to that pick up theBeekeeper's Veil hanging under the shelf on the wall to the right of the window and theGloves hanging down from a hook on the front edge of the worktable
Turn now to the Furnace on your left Place theSmall Logs and Twigsinside Next put in theSplit Logs Use yourLighterthen to start a fire Now turn to the worktable on your right Our first task is to make a key for Leonardo's cupboards Feel free to refer to Leonardo's notes in your Portfolio about making a key We will need Bronze which is said to be an alloy of copper and tin for this purpose So put theCopper Objectand thePewter Dishin the Crucible Click on the crank which is attached to the side of the metal pole that is on the left of the Crucible to raise the Crucible Click on the metallic quot arm quot above the Crucible to move the Crucible into the Furnace Click on the crank again to lower the Crucible on the Furnace floor and the hero will say quot Perfect but it is not hot enough quot Click on the metallic quot arm quot again to move it out of the Furnace leaving the Crucible inside Click on the huge metallic cover sitting on the floor under the Furnace to pick it up You can't deposit it in your Inventory of course Just move it up to the Furnace and click to place the cover on the Furnace
Open your Inventory and put on yourGloves by clicking on the gloves and then on the hero's portrait in the upper right portion of the Inventory Click on the Furnace cover again but the hero might ask you to wait for just a few more seconds In fact itwillbe only a few seconds before you can click on the cover again to remove it and place it back on the floor Click on the metallic arm now to bring it back above the Crucible Click on the crank to raise the Crucible Click on the arm again to bring the Crucible back to the table and then click on the crank again to lower the Crucible on to the table Click on the arm one more time to move that device out of the way for now
Place theKey Mouldon the table in front of the Crucible Click on the Crucible to pour the contents into the mould Click on thegearicon on the mould to open its cover Pick up theBronze Key and then theKey Mould We are done with the Forging area for now so let's take care of a few things in the Mill area Note You can go back to Saturnin and he will tell you generally how to use the Mill to make paper and flour orjust proceed as follows
Put theOld Clothesin what looks like a trough on the left side of the Mill area Next put in some water from yourBottle of Water Close the cover
Click on the handle which appears under and to the right of the anvil The machine will start grinding
You don't need to wait at all Just click on the same handle again to stop the grinding open the cover and then pick up thePaper Mach
Bring out a handful ofGrains of Wheatand put it in the large metallic Funnel that you see up on the loft against the left side of the ceiling Look down on the floor to your right and pull the handle on the left of the bucket by the door Pick up theFlourfrom the bucket Feel free to pull the same handle again to stop the machine We are done in the Mill area as well so let's return to the other side of the movable bridge again
We still have two more things to take care of before we can return to the Manor So click on the left anchoring device this time to move the bridge back towards the Dovecot parcel of ground again Step across the bridge and then turn left Pick up a log and place it on the tree stump Use yourAxeto chop this log Pick up theSplit Logsfrom the ground Note one click will pick up both pieces that have fallen on either side of the tree stump
Turn right now step forward and then look at the beehive on your left Put on yourBeekeeper's Veil Click on the smoking apparatus quot Bee Smoker quot sitting on the ground to the right of the beehive to open it Put someDead Leavesin it use yourLighterto light a fire in those leaves and then pick up theBee Smoker Bring out theBee Smokerand click on the beehive to chase the bees away Put away theBee Smoker just right click and then click on the top of the beehive to pick up its cover You cannot put this cover in your Inventory though Instead put it on the small stool to the left of the beehive Click on the beehive now to remove twoHoneybee Combs Feel free to replace the beehive cover Now take off yourBeekeeper's Veil again unless you want to hear Saturnin's quot crack quot when you approach him and start to move away You can take off your gloves as well
Return to the Manor now and approach Saturnin standing to the left of the Store Room Exit Feel free to tell him that you have repaired the bridge even though doing so will not affect either your Bonus Score or your Conscience gauge The only new thing you will learn is that you need to use the press to make sheets of paper out of the paper mach you made in the mill
More importantly however talk to him about the twoHoneybee Combframes you removed from the beehive At the end of the dialog he will take both of them from you to keep one for himself in exchange for making honey for you out of the other one Note Once again you may ask him about purchasing something from him even though you really don't need to do so But if you do ask him about it be sure to do that at the end of the conversation because he will not talk to you about anything except the purchases when he is inside the Barn He talks about other matters only when he is standing outside next to the Store Room Entrance and you would have to go elsewhere and then come back before he returns to that location again
Go upstairs now to Leonardo's bedroom Approach the locked cupboard under the painting on the other side of the bed Remember it was in front of this cupboard that you had found your mirror the night before
Use your newly madeBronze Keyon the keyhole in the top center of this cupboard The quot Exit quot image of the combined Sun and Moon appears in the lower right hand portion of the screen indicating the beginning of this puzzle
The Cupboard Puzzle No
This is really a very easy puzzle which is actually more complicated to explain than it is to solve Take a moment to study the set up and get comfortable with it Note how the cupboard is divided into five verticalcolumnsand four horizontalrows The keyhole appears at the top of the central section i e inRow Column There is a rectangular compartment under this keyhole and a large diamond shaped socket under that compartment inRow Column Note the location of the pinkKnobat the top of this diamond shaped socket above three gray actually empty slots This is our Reference or theFixedcell
There are eight other cells on either side of Column i e cells in all and each pink knob appears in different locations within its diamond shaped socket in all of these sixteen cells The objective is to bringallthose pink knobs at the top of the three empty gray slots just as it appears in our Reference Fixed cell
Note the eight Control Knobs ndash four at the top of Columns and and then two on the left and two on the right side of the cupboard As you can probably guess the Control Knob at the top of a column or controls the adjustment of all four Knobs under it in that column Similarly each Control Knob on the Left side of the cupboard controls the adjustment of the four Knobs appearing to its right in that row and each Control Knob on the Right side of the cupboard controls the adjustment of the four Knobs appearing to its left in that row Thus we must click on theseControl Knobsto set every pink knob at the top of its socket in the sixteen cells on both sides of the Reference Fixed cell
Now I am not sure if the computer sets those pink knobs randomly in each game but this is how it worked out for me I clicked on the Control Knob at the top in Column threetimes until the pink knob inRow Column was set at the top Column twice until the pink knob inRow Column was set at the top Column none because the pink knob inRow Column was already set at the top and Column once to bring the pink knob inRow Column at the top
I then clicked on the Control Knobs at the sides of the cupboard as follows Right Side Top none because all the pink knobs inRow were already set at the top Right Side Bottom three times to bring the four pink knobs inRow at the top Left Side Top once to bring the four pink knobs inRow at the top and Left Side Bottom none because all the pink knobs inRow were already set at the top
Thus the rectangular compartment opened as soon as I took Step above
Pick up theMould for Gold Blanks theCoining Die theHammer Leonardo's Jewel and theRoll of Parchmentfrom this compartment Be sure to retrieve yourBronze Keyfrom the cupboard keyhole as well Open your Inventory then and attach theRoll of Parchmentto the Portfolio The close up you get shows that it is a quot Plan of Cloux Manor ndash First Floor quot If you move the cursor around the Text Field will indicate the various areas in and outside the Manor Note the gear icon you get when you move your cursor around the circular drawings in the four corners of the document But we don't have any information about what they represent or how to use them So let's just ignore them for now and head for Leonardo's Study
As you enter the Study turn left and step towards the table to the right of the fireplace Turn right and look down at the table Click on the drawer to open it Pick up theMonocleand theBlood Stoneyou find inside Close the drawer and step towards the lab area
Use yourBronze Keyto open the cupboard on the right above the table Pick up theNuggets of Goldfrom the top shelf and the four small glass jars one filled withVarnishand the other three with theRed Blue andYellowpaints from the bottom shelf Close the cupboard and retrieve yourBronze Key
We need to make some Blank Ink now Feel free to refer to Leonardo's notes about making this ink in your Portfolio to note that we can use eitherCharcoalorGall Nutas the powdered black pigment necessary in making the blank ink So put eitherCharcoalorGall Nut whichever you prefer into the Mortar and use the Pestle on the right of the Mortar to grind it Pick up the powder from the Mortar and then bring it out of your Inventory and put it in the empty dish on your right Add anEgg and then some water from yourOpened Bottle of Water into this dish The solution is ready so bring out yourEmpty Phial of Inkand click on the dish to fill this phial with the newly made Blank Ink
Go down to the Workshop and approach the Press Note the thin drawer right under the Pressing block Click on the handle in the center of this drawer to pull out the drawer Click on the top of the drawer to open its cover Note that there are four little balls of Paper Mach in your Inventory
Take out one of them and put it in the drawer and then close the drawer and push it back in Click now on the hammer like handle above the Pressing block The handle will move to the left pushing the Pressing block go down Click on the handle again to move it to the right bringing the Pressing block back up Pull the drawer out open its cover and remove your firstBlank Sheet of Paper Repeat this procedure to make three more Blank Sheets of Paper out of the other three balls of Paper Mach in your Inventory
Now that we have some paper let's print the two Engraved Plates that we have in our Inventory So open the cover of the drawer unless it is already open of course after you made your last Blank Sheet of Paper and put one of the two Engraved Plates in it Bring out your newly filledPhial of Inkand click on theEngraved Plateinside the drawer to spread some ink on this plate Put aBlank Sheet of Paperon the now inked plate close the drawer and push it back in Now click on the handle above the Pressing block to push the Pressing block down and then click on the handle again to bring the Pressing block back up Open the drawer and removeboththe just printedSheet of Paperand the inkedEngraved Plate Now print anotherSheet of Paperfrom yoursecondEngraved Platein the same way Again remember to remove both the newly printedSheet of Paperand the inkedEngraved Plate We are done printing for now So close the drawer and push it back in
Well now that we have printed both our Engraved Plates let's see what we got So attach each of these new Sheets of Paper to the Portfolio one by one and examine their contents It's all right if you lost track of which of the two Engraved Plates you had received from the lady and which one you found right here in the Workshop because it really doesn't matter If youhavekept track though you will find that theSheet of Paperprinted from the lady's plate tells us a little bit about the bridge we fixed earlier Note Use the mirror to decipher the writing in the top and central portions of this Sheet
As for theSheet of Paperprinted from the second plate use the Mirror at the top of the page to learn something about the quot fumagents quot and how to make them Now click on the drawing of the two cannons in the lower right hand portion of the page and those cannons will quot go off quot spilling some writing of their own Use the Mirror again on this writing to learn how to make gun powder
Go down to the Store Room Step outside the house and Saturnin will call you from behind and give you a jar ofHoney Go to the Mill now Note You will have to click on the right anchoring device to move the bridge in the Mill's direction first
Put theSplit Logsinto the Furnace to revive the fire Put theNuggets of Goldinto the Crucible Click on the Metallic Arm to bring it back to the table Click on the crank at the side of the metal pole to lift the Crucible off the table
Click on the Metallic Arm again to move the Crucible into the Furnace Click on the crank again to lower the Crucible into the Furnace The hero will note that it is not hot enough meaning we must cover the furnace of course Click on the Mechanical Arm to move it out of the way Pick up the large cover from the ground and put it on the Furnace Put on your gloves then and try to remove the Furnace Cover Note You might have to wait a few seconds and try again though as you did when you had made the bronze
After removing the cover click on the Metallic Arm again to bring it back to the Furnace Click on the crank to raise the Crucible Click on the Metallic Arm once more to bring the Crucible back to the table Click on the crank again to lower the Crucible down on the table Finally click on the Metallic Arm to move it out of the way
Place theMould for Gold Blankson the table in front of the Crucible Click on the Crucible to pour the Molten Gold into the Mould Click on the Mould twice to recover first the four Gold Blanks and then the Mould itself Bring out theCoining Diefrom your Inventory and place it in the circular slot on top of the Anvil to the right of the table Bring out one of the four Gold Blanks then and place it on top of theCoining Die Use theHammeron theGold Blank and then pick up theGold Coin Place the other three Gold Blanks one by one on top of the Coining Die still in the anvil slot Use theHammeron each of these Gold Blanks to produce three more Gold Coins one by one Keep picking up each Gold Coin as you make it After you make your last fourth Gold Coin pick up yourCoining Die Note The coins you just made are added to the coin collection that appears under the Diary in your Inventory
We are done in both the Mill and the Forging areas of the Mill So take off your gloves and return to the Manor Go back up to Leonardo's Study and approach the lady still seated on the couch Give herLeonardo's Jewel that you had found in the cupboard in his bedroom She will thank you and you will be given a choice of two responses Pick thefirstresponse telling her that you had found the jewel in Leonardo's cabinet This response will not affect either your Bonus Score or your Conscience gauge but the other one would have cost you Angelic points without gaining anything in return
Click on the lady and the hero will tell her about having fixed the bridge She will be pleased of course but would like yet another favor from you Again you are presented with a choice of two responses
Although neither choice will affect either your Bonus Score or your Conscience gauge pick the first choice anyway because the other one is rather rude and the lady's reaction will be understandably unpleasant as well So tell her that you are listening and she will now ask you to play your lyre Bring out theLyre As you do the instrument will appear fixed in the top left portion of the screen while the lower portion of the screen will be subdivided into three portions featuring the strings of the lyre on the left a musical sheet in the middle and the Sun Moon quot Exit quot sign on your right You will also hear the first three sample notes inviting you to solve this puzzle
The Lyre Puzzle The objective is topick the right strings to match the notes you just heard Move your cursor across the strings in the lower left portion of the screen and note the five positions each appearingaftereach string in which the gear icon appears Imagine as if these clickable points were numbered as follows ndash Play the following notes Click on the stposition
Click on the ndposition
Click on the rdposition
As you play each note a symbol will appear in the musical score sheet in the middle of the lower part of the screen The color of this symbol will bedark brown if you have played the correct note butred if you have not Note You can click on the lady at any time to hear the sample notes again Apparently she is the one who is ndash perhaps whistling ndash these notes for you to play
If you have played the first three notes correctly you will hear another sample of notes that you must match This time play the following notes Click on the thposition
Click on the ndposition
Click on the ndposition again
Click on the stposition
As you play the last note correctly acut scene will follow showing the hero and the lady sitting together on the couch apparently singing and laughing as the tune you started plays on sweetly in the background Bad news follows this cut scene however as the lady declares that her throat is sore from all the singing You must now arrange for a cure The hero thinks that Saturnin might be able to help So go down to the Store Room step outside and talk to Saturnin He will tell you about a remedy consisting of honey thyme lemon and water Turn around and click on thesecondarrow to your left to arrive directly at the pool Fill up your now Empty Bottle of Waterwith water again and return to Leonardo's Study
Go directly to the lab area Remove theGooseneckfrom the top of the Still Put theHoney Thyme Lemonand some water from yourBottle of Water one by one into the Still Remember to click in thecenterof the Still to put in the ingredients
The hero indicates that the remedy is ready Note At this point youcanput in the Sleeping Potion in the Still but you will just lose Angelic points altogether and gain nothing at all Moreover you would not be able to go into the lady's apartments by yourself either because the door is locked So you would have to wait i e go out of the room and then come back for her to wake up and take you there herself In short there is no use in resorting to the Diabolic approach at all
So just bring out theEmpty Bowl the tea cup and click on the Still to get aBowl full of Syrup Go to the lady then and offer her this syrup The lady will be pleased and will take you to her apartments without any further ado
After the dialog step to your left Click on the drawing set in the corner on an easel on your left As the hero finishes his comment the gear icon on the drawing will turn into a hand icon But if you click on this icon the hero will decline to pick up this drawing saying that he will do so later So turn now to the large drawing on the wall on your right Click on it and listen to another comment by the hero Note the sketch of a hand in the upper left portion of the drawing Feel free to refer to Leonardo's notes about the invisible ink in your Portfolio and see that the same sketch appears in those notes as well Thus this is a clue that there might be something written in invisible ink on the sketch on the wall also So bring out yourLighterand clickanywhereat all on the wall drawing Sure enough a line sketch of a telescope will appear right between the sketch of the hand on the left and that of the woman on the right Wait for the hero to finish his comment and then return to the lady on the couch
Click on the lady and listen to the dialog about the sketch of the Battle of Anghiari You will then be presented with a choice of two responses Feel free to pick either because neither choice will affect your Bonus Score or your Conscience gauge Turn around then and look at the telescope Click on it and another dialog will follow Click on the magnifying glass icon now appearing at the eye piece to try to look through the telescope As the hero finishes speaking click on thegear iconon the telescope to open a small cover at the top a little further up from the eye piece Click on this new opening and the hero will tell you that the lens is stuck Use yourKnife on the opening to remove theBroken Lens Then bring out theMonoclefrom your Inventory and insert it in the opening to serve as the telescope's new lens Note If you click on the handle sticking out from the right of the telescope to change the telescope's position the hero will tell you that it is jammed If you try to oil it then the hero will decline to do so at this time
Click on the magnifying glass icon on the eye piece to look through the telescope again A cut scene will follow taking you on to the next day
Day ndash September As the hero wakes up he wants to look at Leonardo's telescope again So go down to the Kitchen and step forward to the door that leads to the small hallway with the stairs going up to the First Floor Instead of stepping out into the hallway however take a step to your right Turn right again and pick up theFull Bottle of White Winefrom the table in front of the fireplace Turn around and note that several sacks that had been there on the ground since your arrival have now been removed revealing a trap door Click on the door to hear the hero's comment But let's ignore the door for now because we need to find out more about that telescope upstairs So step out of the Kitchen and go upstairs to Babou's apartments Go past her bedroom and enter her Sitting Room
Approach and click on Babou After the dialog turn around to the telescope and click on its handle to find that it is still jammed So bring out theOilfrom your Inventory and click on the handle to oil it Right click to put away the Oil and then click on the telescope's handle again to see the telescope swing to the right Another dialog follows Click on the magnifying glass icon appearing at the left end of the telescope to look through the telescope Turn around now and click on Babou Two topics will be presented to you Click on any one of them and then click on Babou again to address the other topic as well thus gaining some information about both Leonardo and his telescope
Go down to the Store Room step outside and click on Saturnin sitting down on a bench today As the dialog ends we must now calm Saturnin's suspicions to get those quot two circular lenses quot that the hero suspects he is hiding Bring out theBrandyfrom your Inventory and give it to him But he seems even more suspicious now or perhaps just greedy for some more Brandy You are presented with a choice of two responses each representing a different Diabolical or Angelical way of dealing with this situation
The Diabolic Approach Pick the first choice urging Saturnin to remember harder You lose Angelic points Go up to Leonardo's Study and towards the lab area Open the Boiler cover put in someCharcoal and use yourLighterto light up a fire Close the Boiler Cover bring out yourFull Bottle of White Wine and click in the center of the Still Bring out theGooseneckfrom the Inventory and place it on top of the Still The hero indicates that the product is ready as it trickles into the phial to your right Bring out yourEmpty phial of Brandyand click on the distilled product to fill your phial with more Brandy You gain bonus points Go down to the Store Room step outside the house and give thisBrandyto Saturnin He will graciously accept and doze off after drinking it Open your Inventory and click on the Angelic gauge to restore the balance in your Conscience gauge Thus your net loss is points you had gained for making Brandy Bonus Points if you take this approach
The Angelic Approach Pick the second choice telling Saturnin that you were just trying to be pleasant Saturnin won't seem too pleased with this answer but he will allow you to go fetch the colored lenses from his cabinet in the Barn warning you not to touch anything else Check your Conscience gauge to find your Angelic Score has risen by points Thus you must click on the Diabolic gauge to restore balance in your Conscience gauge losing Bonus Points But after you are finished in the Barn you can still go make Brandy and gain the points for doing so just as you would have if you had followed the Diabolic approach above Thus your net loss is still points by using this approach as well
In short there is really no difference whether you choose the Angelic or the Diabolic approach at least as far as the Bonus points are concerned But the Angelic approach is quicker
Moreover you won't really need either the points from making Brandy or any more Brandy itself So there is no need to make the Brandy at all making the Angelic approach that much quicker than the Diabolic approach in getting on with the real story
As you step into the Barn look at the cabinet on your left Click on the left door to open it and see the two Colored Lenses on the middle shelf Pick up the two lenses one by one Turn right and click on the white piece of paper on the stool in front of the table with all the items that Saturnin had offered for sale Listen to the message read by the hero Then click on thegear iconappearing on the little red and white cloth napkin on the table to remove the cloth and reveal the coin that you had used to bribe Saturnin the day before After the hero finishes his comment a hand icon will appear on the coin In fact a hand icon appears on all the items for sale as well allowing you to pick up anything and everything from the table The first time that you try to pick up anything however the hero will suggest not doing so In fact I would suggest the same because you will only lose Angelic points and gain nothing in return
As you step outside the Barn you will find Saturnin asleep even if you had followed the Angelic approach Go back up to Babou in her Sitting Room Click on her and tell her about the message you found in the Barn A dialog will follow and then you will be presented with a choice of two responses Picking the first one will cost you Angelic points without gaining anything in return So pick the second choice and quot confess quot You will lose Diabolic points and would therefore still have to use bonus points to restore the balance in your Conscience gauge But you will also gain some information and probably a new ally
Now turn around and note the two slots at the front end of the telescope Bring out the two ColoredLensesfrom your Inventory one by one and click on the front end of the telescope to put the lenses in those two slots Note The telescope will reveal three parts of a message The order in which these parts come up seems to be randomly generated by the computer Thus no matter which of these two colored lenses you click on the first two times you will get only Parts and of the message Part is revealed only after you have already discovered the first two parts
So proceed as follows Click ONCE on theoutercolored lens and then look through the telescope to hear the hero read Part quot then find the Philosopher's stone quot Click ONCE again on thesamelens and then look through the telescope to hear the hero now read Part quot and the path to power will open up before you quot Finally click TWICE on theinnercolored lens and the hero will read Part quot First look for the stars quot After this the hero will automatically read all three parts of the message in the correct order and then restate the message or rather the riddle quot First seek the stars then find the Philosopher's Stone and the path of power will open up before you quot He will then turn to Babou and a dialog will follow
We must now find the constellation corresponding to the one we saw through the telescope As the hero described it it is a lozenge topped by a fifth star Babou identifies it as the constellation of Lyre and suggests using Leonardo's celestial globe So go out to Leonardo's Study and step towards the Celestial Globe to the right of the fireplace
Note that the globe seems to be quot lit up quot now with five bright points on it These points correspond to the five points of the Lyre constellation we saw through the telescope
Note also the three metallic gold strips across the globe One of these strips crosses the globehorizontallyat the top while the other two cross itdiagonally We must ALIGN these three strips and the globe itself so that the five quot lit quot points on the globe will come to the front and shinethroughthe overlapping holes in all three metal strips See Picture below
As soon as you achieve the correct alignment the globe will split open holding out at its top a medallion that looks like the combined image of the Sun and the Moon just like the quot Exit quot icon in the Inventory Pick up the medallion and a cut scene will follow
After the cut scene go down to the Store Room step outside and speak to Saturnin He will introduce you to the black cat curled up on the bench beside him Feel free to click on the cat itself to have Saturnin repeat the introduction Now go back upstairs to Babou still in her Sitting Room Click on her and you will be presented with a choice of four topics The new topics will be highlighted in white while the old one is grayed out Feel free to address the old topic if you like but youmustcover the three new topics clicking on Babou repeatedly to do so in order to proceed forward in the story Thus you learn that quot Alkahest quot the name of the manor cat also means the Philosopher's Stone and that the cat wears a medallion
Go down to Saturnin but neither he nor the cat is at the bench anymore So go to the Dovecot Note You will have to move the bridge in that direction first by clicking once on the left anchoring mechanism
As you approach the Dovecot you will see the cat sitting up in the loft's window Click on the magnifying glass icon that appears on the cat to hear an amusing comment by the hero Then step inside the Dovecot and go up to the loft The camera will automatically pan down to the cat as the hero makes another comment As he finishes click on the cat to retrieve the second medallion which looks like a silver crescent moon
Return to the manor and go to the Trap Door now in the Kitchen Note the two sacks lying on the left portion of this door Pick up the one on the right You can't put this sack in your Inventory of course Rather click on the floor to the left of the door to put the sack there Put the other sack there as well Then click on the little circular hook that had been hidden by the two sacks to try to lift the door The hero will tell you that it's too heavy Look up at the ceiling and note the brown pulley Bring out theLong Ropefrom your Inventory and click on the pulley The rope will be automatically slid through the pulley and one of its ends will be tied to the hook in the door and the other to a wheel on the wall Bring out the quot multi purpose quot Crankfrom your Inventory and click on the wheel to attach the crank to it Now click on thewheel to lift the door Then click on thehandicon on theCrank to retrieve it
Bring out theLighterfrom your Inventory and click on the lantern hanging down from the lifted door Pick up the lit lantern quot Lamp quot then bring it out of your Inventory and step down the stairs of what we will call the Cellar As you come down turn left and pick up two handfuls ofSaltpetrefrom the wall Turn right and pick up theCannon Ballfrom the floor Turn further right and note the three barrels one on top of two others on the ground to the left of the staircase Pick up theEngraved Plate leaning against the left side of the top barrel Turn back around then and step further in the Cellar Turn left and click on the bricked up doorway Turn right and click down on the cannon Now turn further right and click on the prototype of Leonardo's flying machine Note that even though the hero says that he would take care of that machine later he also complains about its being quot pitch black inside quot So look up to your right and use yourLighterto light up the chandelier
Turn left and click on the flying machine again to hear the hero describe what is wrong with it But we don't have any reason or equipment to try to fix it just yet So ignore it for now turn right and step forward to return to the first part of the Cellar Turn slightly left and click on the magnifying glass icon now appearing on what looks like another Engraved Plate on the ground leaning against a table or a bench The hero indicates that we need some kind of a powder to make the marks on the plate more visible So bring out theFlourfrom your Inventory and click on the plate to spread the flour over the plate A short cut scene will follow showing the hero making a note of those marks on a Blank Sheet of Paper But you can't attach this Sheet to your Portfolio just yet because it is quot still incomplete quot Thus you can't even see the marks the hero just noted We need more information to proceed further anyway So let's ignore the marks and the sheet for now and proceed with the story
We are done in the Cellar for now so return to the Kitchen and head for the Workshop Go to the Sawing machine and place theBroomin front of the sawing blade Click on the foot pedal to start the sawing Then click on the Broom to move it against the blade and saw the Broom in half Pick up both theShort Broomand theWooden Shaft
Turn left and step over to the Press Click on the drawer under the Pressing block to pull out the drawer Open the cover of the drawer and place theEngraved Plateyou just found in the drawer Now bring out thePhial of Inkfrom your Inventory and click on the Engraved Plate to ink it Then bring out your lastBlank Sheet of Paperand place it on the now inked Engraved Plate Close the cover of the drawer then and click on the drawer to push it back under the Pressing block Click once on the handle above the Pressing block to push the block down and then click on the handle again to bring the block back up Pull out the drawer open the cover and retrieve both theSheet of Paperand the now inkedEngraved Plate Close the drawer and push it back under the Pressing block again
Open your Inventory and attach the printedSheet of Paperto the Portfolio Use the Mirror to read about quot Alberti's Grid quot at the bottom of the newly printed Sheet of Paper the page on the right in the Portfolio As you exit the Portfolio feel free to click on the Diary and flip back to the quot To be done as quickly as possible quot list for the date of September You will find that the second item about printing Leonardo's plates is now crossed out indicating that we have recovered and printed the last of the Engraved Plates we were supposed to print
Turn around and approach the crooked door If you click on the handle the hero will tell you once more that the door has come off its hinges So open your Inventory bring out theJack and place it under the door Now bring out theCrankfrom your Inventory and place it on this Jack Click on thegear iconon the Crank to straighten the door Click on the hand icon appearing on the Jack then to pick up both theJackas well as theCrankin one swoop Click on the doorknob then to move the door aside and reveal a large gray cabinet behind Click on this cabinet to open it Click inside to start yet another puzzle
The Cups amp Balls Puzzle Again it is much more complicated to explain the solution than to solve the puzzle itself Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the set up There are two cups at the bottom of the cabinet under the round mechanical plate There is a red dot on the left cup indicating that we must put only red balls in this cup So we will call it the RED CUP
Similarly there is a yellow dot on the right cup indicating that we must put only yellow balls in that cup So we will call this the YELLOW CUP
Now look at the round mechanical plate above the two cups If we pull the chained handle on the right the plate will start rotating clockwise and several red and yellow balls will slide down from the upper left side of the mechanism and fill the holes in the outer edge or rim of the metallic plate Note the two interlocking rings with holes of their own in the top half of the plate Let's call the smaller ring on the left quot RING quot and the larger ring on the right quot RING quot See Picture below Note that you can drop the balls into the Red and Yellow cups only by moving them through RING Moving the balls through RING only returns the balls into the outer edge of the round metallic plate
Examine the two arc like gold colored buttons in each of these two rings
Clicking on the button at the TOP of RING will move the ring and the balls in its holes clockwise while clicking on the button at the BOTTOM of this ring will move the ring and the balls in its holes anti clockwise The set up in RING is the direct opposite of this in that clicking on the button at the TOP of RING moves that ring and the balls in its holes anti clockwise while clicking on the button at the BOTTOM of that ring moves that ring and the balls in its holes clockwise
Finally note that the puzzle is set up so that the balls will alternate between the cups as they drop i e the first ball to go down will automatically drop in the RED CUP the second will drop in the YELLOW CUP the third will drop in the RED CUP again etc So it is very important that you line up the balls in alternating colors as well so that only the red balls will go into the RED CUP and only the yellow balls will go into the YELLOW CUP
Now that we have figured out the set up let's solve the puzzle Please keep in mind however that the order of the balls filling in the metallic plate might be randomly generated by the computer So they might turn up in a different order for you than they did for me Just be sure to drop the red balls in the RED CUP and the yellow balls in the YELLOW CUP In fact you must drop a total of red balls in the RED CUP and yellow balls in the YELLOW CUP If you miss and a ball goes in the wrong cup don't worry Just click on the quot Exit quot icon step away and then come right back and start the puzzle to find that the puzzle has been reset for you Here is how it worked out for me
As I started the puzzle I found a red ball was already in RING before I even pulled the chain So I clicked ONCE on the top button in RING to move the red ball into RING I then clicked THREE times on the top button in RING to move the red ball down and into the RED CUP I then pulled the chain As the metallic plate started rotating a yellow ball immediately slipped into RING I then waited for a red ball to appear in the metallic plate's outer edge just above the yellow ball in RING As the red ball appeared I clicked ONCE on the top button in RING Thus the yellow ball moved into RING while the red ball slipped into RING right behind it I then clicked THREE times on the top button in RING to deposit the yellow ball in the YELLOW CUP
I then waited again this time for a yellow ball to appear in the metallic plate's outer edge above the red ball already in RING As the yellow ball appeared I clicked ONCE on the top button in RING thus moving the second red ball into RING as the second yellow ball slipped into RING behind it I then clicked THREE times on the top button in RING to deposit my second red ball into the RED CUP Note Don't worry if let's say a red ball slips into RING instead of the yellow one you were trying to get in there Use the button at thebottomof RING to move the ringanticlockwise just as a yellow ball appears in the metallic plate's outer edge
The yellow ball will slip in the empty hole in front of the red ball you just moved away Thus you don't have to start all over By clicking repeatedly on the button at the bottom of RING you can even return the wrong ball to the outer edge of the metallic plate Be careful in using the button at the bottom of RING however because if pushed repeatedly at a time it will just move the ball clockwise only to still drop it into one of the cups when you might have been trying to just move that ball back to RING
Note also that the metallic plate tends to stop rotating after a while so you will have to pull the chain on your right from time to time After dropping balls into each cup first in red then in yellow then in red again etc
when you drop the th red ballin the RED CUP both the cups will go down and then come back up again as the quot Exit quot sign in the lower right hand corner of the screen disappears This means that you have solved the puzzle At that point click on the wooden lever sticking out from the bottom right portion of the cabinet The camera will automatically pan to your right and you will see a wooden platform come up
Step onto the platform turn around and pull the lever in the floor on your right A short cut scene will follow as the platform serves as an elevator to take the hero down into what we will call the Workshop Cellar The cut scene will end focusing our view on the lever on the floor showing that it is now on our left Turn right and take a step forward in this Cellar Look to your right and click on the gray wall cabinet to open it and find the same kind of mechanism inside that you had just used upstairs to summon the platform elevator But you don't have to solve a puzzle here If you click on the lever at the bottom right of this cabinet the camera will automatically pan to your right and show that the elevator has gone up Click on the lever again and the camera will pan to the right to show that the elevator has returned But there is no need to fiddle with this mechanism at all Apparently it was put here only to show us how someone approaching from the other side of the Cellar would be able to summon the elevator to take him up into the Manor
Step forward to your left and the camera will automatically pan down further to your left as the hero will comment quot Ah what's this quot Click on the ground to clear away some of the dirt and reveal a set of marks Bring out theShort Broomfrom your Inventory and click on the marks to reveal a similar set of marks above the one already exposed Take out theincompleteSheet of Paper from your Inventory and place it on these marks Now bring out theCharcoal Crayon and click on the Sheet of Paper you just placed on the ground to trace the marks onto the Sheet of Paper Pick up theSheet of Paper and the hero will inform you that we don't have a key yet to decode these marks Open the Inventory and attach this Sheet of Paper to the Portfolio Thus we will finally be able to see the marks but as the hero warned us we don't have enough information yet to decipher them
Step forward into the Cellar turn right and click on the door Listen to the hero's comment and note the round gray plate in the upper part of the door Bring out the Sun MoonMedallionfrom your Inventory and place it in the gold colored round slot on the right side of the gray plate Bring out the Crescent MoonMedallionfrom your Inventory and place it in the gold colored crescent shaped slot in the top left portion of the plate
The door will swing open but it is dark inside So bring out the lantern quot Lamp quot from your Inventory and step forward to come down a set of stairs
Turn slightly to your right and step forward Then turn slightly to your left and step through the Iron Gate Turn slightly to your left again and step forward to reach an arched doorway leading to a lighted area Step through this doorway look down on the ground and pick up thePrecious Stone As the hero finishes his comment look up at the door leading to a well lit stairwell in front of you But if you click in this direction the hero will decline to go there So turn left and click on a door that is slightly ajar to open it completely Step through this door and the camera will automatically pan to your left As the hero finishes his comment click on the metal plate in the door but it will squeak and the hero will advise us to be more discreet So bring out theOilfrom your Inventory and click on the plate to oil it Now click on the plate again to open it A cutscene will follow
By the end of the cutscene the hero will be out of that room and decline to go back in there The stairs to the King's castle are on your left and the way back up to the Workshop Cellar is on your right So turn right and take two steps forward There is no icon to allow you to go down the passage in front of you So turn slightly to your right again and step forward Turn slightly right again to see the foot of the stairs leading back to the Workshop Cellar Note It would be a good idea toSAVEyour game here Click in the direction of the stairs then and a cut scene will follow taking you to yet another new day at the Manor
Day ndash September Francois I had given his Signet Ring and a Sheet of Paper As the cut scene ends open your Inventory and attach that Sheet of Paper to the Portfolio In the close up that follows the right page shows the marks you had traced in the two Cellars The left page is the King's sheet which is in fact the key to the marks on the right page But we need to take care of something else before deciphering these marks So go down to the Kitchen and find Saturnin sitting on the table in front of the fireplace Approach the fireplace and a cut scene will follow
As the cut scene ends go back up to Babou's apartments As you approach the door to her Sitting Room turn left and pick up theKeyfrom the mannequin Enter the Sitting Room and the camera will automatically pan to your left focusing your view on the Venetian cabinet Bring out the key that you just retrieved from the mannequin from your Inventory and click on the keyhole in the top center of the cabinet to start yet another puzzle
The Cupboard Puzzle No
As you can see this puzzle is similar to the one we solved in Leonardo's Bedroom on the second day i e quot The Cupboard Puzzle No
quot
Once again take a moment to study the set up and get comfortable with it Thus note how the cabinet is divided into five verticalcolumnsand four horizontalrows The keyhole indicated by the green cell marked quot K quot in the picture below appears at the top of the central section i e inRow Column Again there is a rectangular compartment under this keyhole just as there was in Leonardo's cabinet But instead of the large diamond shaped socket we had in that puzzle there is acolored circular pattern inRow Column under the compartment in this puzzle Thus this pattern is our Reference indicated by the green cell marked quot R quot in the picture below in this particular puzzle
Again there are eight other cells on either side of Column i e the unmarked white cells in the above picture and we find a variety of patterns in these cells The objective once again is to make the same pattern appear in each of these sixteen cells as the one that appears in our Reference Fixed cell
Note that we have sixteen Control Knobs in this puzzle I have labeled the four control knobs at theTOPasT T T andT the four at theBOTTOMasB B B andB the four on theLEFTside of the cabinet asL L L andL and finally the four on theRIGHTside of the cabinet asR R R andR Thus we must click on theseControl Knobsto set the pattern in each of the sixteen cells in columns and to match the pattern that appears in the Reference Fixed cell Once again the Control Knob at the Top of a column adjusts the four Knobs under it the Control Knob at the Bottom of a column adjusts the four Knobs above it the Control Knob on the Left side of the cabinet adjusts the four Knobs to its right and the Control Knob on the Right side of the cabinet adjusts the four Knobs to its left
Again I am not sure if the computer sets the patterns for the sixteen cells randomly in each game but this is how it worked out for me and hopefully it will for you too I clicked OnceonR
TwiceonR andonceonL
TwiceonR
These first three steps set the correct pattern in all four cells in theT column I then clicked TwiceonT andonceonB to set the correct pattern in all cells in theT column
TwiceonT to set the correct pattern in all cells in theT column
OnceonT andonceonB to set the correct pattern in all cells in theT column
Thus as soon as I finished Step above the left desk drawer opened
Click on the document inside the drawer to find that it is the Letter of Introduction that you had given to Babou on the nd day Pick up the gray sheet on the left of the letter place it above the letter and click to find that the letter contains a secret message A cut scene will follow bringing the hero back out in Leonardo's Study He will refuse to go back into Babou's apartments So go down to Saturnin who is still in the Kitchen Click on him and you will be presented with two topics You don't need to buy anything from him but click on that choice anyway to find that no bargaining is possible anymore because of the guards outside Click on Saturnin again and the dialog will automatically follow
The Four Signs Puzzle It's time to use the King's key to decode the marks we found in the two cellars So go to those two pages in the Portfolio Examine the key on theLEFTpage Note the numbers around the symbol in the upper left hand corner of the page Note also that this one symbol is in fact a combination of four symbols each adjacent to a number from to Thus each symbol represents the number that is closest to it We find the symbols representing the numbers and in the same way
Look at the marks on theRIGHTpage now There are four rows each of which begins with a circular drawing on the left followed by two or three symbols Note the image of a heavenly body inside each circular drawing So let's refer to each drawing by the object in it Thus going from the top to the bottom of the page we have the SUN the STAR the MOON and Saturn i e the PLANETS
Pick up theBlood Stone from the right of the Portfolio and it will appear as your cursor
Click on the first symbol after theSundrawing on the right page and then click on number on the left page Since this is a correct match a white space will appear at the end of the row Click in this white space to see number appear in it Click on the second symbol now then on number and then on the white space Since this is also a correct match number will appear in the white space Finally click on the third symbol then on number and then on the white space to see number appear in it Thus you will now have in the white space at the end of the first row Proceed in the same way for the other rows to obtain the following results Row SUN Row STAR Row MOON Row PLANETS Turn to the next page in the Portfolio quot Plan of Cloux Manor ndash First Floor quot The circular drawings we just saw in the previous page now appear in the four corners of this Plan It is much easier to identify the heavenly bodies in these drawings however because of the sketch of those bodies the Sun Star Moon or Planets next to the drawings Note how each circular drawing is divided up in degrees The four main degrees and have been marked for our convenience Note the two arrows around each circular drawing If you move your cursor over them a gear icon will appear on each arrow Clicking once on either arrow will move the dial along the inner edge of the circle by degrees Based on this information set the dials in the drawings as follows SUN in the upper left portion STAR in the upper right portion MOON in the lower left portion PLANETS in the lower right portion As you adjust the degrees a gray beam from each drawing will move across the Plan If you have set the correct values the four beams will overlap and a red quot X quot will mark the juncture Move your cursor over this X and the Text Field will show that quot The Manuscript is hidden somewhere in front of the entrance to the manor quot Close the Portfolio and the Inventory to hear the hero's comment Click on Saturnin to be presented with two topics the first of which we have already addressed So click on the second topic to learn the secret you mustsubtract from the Stars and from the Planets andadd to the Moon So go back to the quot Plan of the Cloux Manor quot in your Portfolio and make the following changes STAR in the upper right portion to PLANETS in the lower right portion to MOON in the lower left portion to The gray beams will now overlap at a slightly different point Move your cursor over the new X and the Text Field will show that quot The Manuscript is hidden in the chapel quot Close the Portfolio and the Inventory and click on Saturnin to be presented with two topics again Click on the first topic the key to the chapel Click on him again to address the second topic why Leonardo entrusted him rather than Melzi with this secret Then go upstairs to Babou's Sitting Room She will start speaking as soon as you approach her and you will get a choice of two responses Although neither will affect your Conscience gauge or Bonus points pick theSECONDresponse quot I shouldn't have lost my temper hellip quot because it will give you a choice at the very end of the game that you won't get otherwise Click on Babou again for another exchange of dialog
Go down to the small hallway and step into the corridor Turn left to see a guard in front of the Main Entrance We don't want to be caught so turn right and step forward in the corridor Use Babou'sKeyto unlock and open the Chapel door on your left Enter the Chapel to hear the hero's comment Turn slightly to the left and pick up theSceptre Now click on the golden Lily under the Cross to hear another comment by the hero Bring out the King'sSignet Ringfrom your Inventory and put it in the hole under the Lily Now bring out theSceptreand put it through the ring to open a door below Pick up theManuscript by Leonardo Da Vincifrom this opening Click under the Lily to retrieve both theSignet Ringand theSceptre in one swoop Then turn to the wall on your right and click in the empty picture frame to the left of the door to hear the hero's comment
We are done in the Chapel and must contact the King's messenger now So go back upstairs and enter the Balcony across the corridor from Leonardo's bedroom The camera will pan to your right to show the guards below as the hero makes a comment Step forward in the balcony Try to pick up some pebbles from the floor to your left but the hero will decline to do so because you already have some So bring out thePebblesfrom your Inventory turn right and study the movements of the two guards below Note that the guard stationed in front of the Main Entrance doesn't move at all There is another guard to his left however that goes back and forth along the side of the house Wait until he starts moving towards the house and then throw the Pebble between the stationary guard and the Main Entrance Thus with both guards now moving towards the house turn quickly and step into the Stairwell Then turn quickly to your extreme left and take two steps and then turn left again and step forward to arrive in front of the moveable bridge
We cannot cross the bridge however because a guard is stationed there as well So step to the right of the bridge Turn left pick up the brush off the boat and place it on the ground to your right Click twice on the boat first to hear a comment by the hero and then to get in it You can reach the Dovecot now in one of two ways go to the Mill across the canal get out of the boat and walk over to the canal across the Dovecot or take the boat to the Bridge then down the canal to your right to reach the Dovecot A guard is stationed before the Dovecot also so you will still have to get out of the boat on the ground to the right of the canal Thus either way you will arrive at the same spot As you do bring out theLadderfrom your Inventory and place it across the canal Then bring out thePebbles and throw one on the fixed bridge to your left As the guard moves in that direction cross the canal and enter the Dovecot
Turn right to note an object barely hidden by the three sacks against the wall Pick up theSheet to find the Mona Lisa painting behind it Pick upthe Mona Lisa and the hero will make a comment Pick up some morePebblesfrom the ground behind you Go up to the loft and a black bird will arrive at the window Bring out the King'sSignet Ringand click on the bird to hear another comment by the hero Meanwhile the guard should have returned to his post before the Dovecot Wait for him to turn his back to you and then bring out thePebblesfrom your Inventory and throw one at the ground floor window behind you The guard will come into the Dovecot and you will get a choice of two approaches to return to the Manor
The Angelic Approach Pick up the straw from the ground on your left and throw it out of the loft window Then jump out of the window Turn left cross the canal and then turn around and pick up theLadder Return to the boat take it back to where you had first found it and step back out on the ground The moveable bridge would be to your right but you must wait for the guard to look away before going there Thus you must sneak behind the guards' backs to return to the Manor Note This approach does not affect your Conscience gauge I call it the Angelic approach only to contrast it with the Diabolic approach described below
The Diabolic Approach As the guard stands below click on the barrel resting at the edge of the loft floor to find that you need a lever to move it So take theIron Baror theShort Broomfrom your Inventory and click on the barrel again to roll it down on the guard Go down and click on the unconscious guard to take theGuard's Uniform Open your Inventory and put on this uniform Click on the Angelic gauge to restore balance to your Conscience gauge Step out of the Dovecot and pick up theLadderfrom your left Go past the guard at the bridge without any problems But the guard patrolling the side of the house will object when you arrive there You get a choice of two responses You will get caught if you pick the first response So pick the second response quot Leave me alone hellip quot and you will not be bothered after that
What Happens if You Get Caught It isn't quot Game Over quot as you might expect Rather you end up back in the hero's room Step towards the fireplace to hear a comment by the hero Turn left towards the door and click on its keyhole to hear another comment by the hero Pick up theBlank Sheet of Paperfrom the floor to the right of the door As the hero finishes his comment bring out thisBlank Sheet of Paperfrom your Inventory and place it under the door Now bring out yourKnifeand click on the keyhole to push the key down on to that paper Wait for the hero to finish his comment and then pick up theBlank Sheet of Paper retrieving theKeyin the same swoop Use theKeyto unlock the door and then open the door and step outside But we can't go down to the Store Room because the hero expects a guard to be stationed there So click on the large wall rug on your right to hear the hero's comment Bring out thePliersfrom your Inventory and pick up aNailfrom each of the two corners at the bottom of the rug Click on the rug again to move it aside and reveal the bookcase behind it
The Bookcase Puzzle ndash The code for this passage from Leonardo's bedroom wasSALAI Since we are on the other side now the code must be read backwards IALAS So press the following books
I ndash the fourth book from the left in the top shelf A ndash the fourth book from the right in the top shelf L ndash the third book from the right in the bottom shelf A ndash the fifth book from the right in the bottom shelf S ndash the fourth book from the left in the middle shelf A short cut scene follows and you will find yourself back in Leonardo's bedroom
As soon as you step into the Manor the hero will indicate that Hector must have come via the Underground Passage and suggest that we go down and meet him If you were caught this comment will come after you enter Leonardo's bedroom through the Bookcase and can thus move about freely again
Go down to the Workshop and approach the gray wall cabinet Open the cabinet and use the lever at the bottom right to summon the platform elevator Step on the platform and go down to the Cellar Step out of the platform and a cut scene will follow Click on Hector again to cover another topic Then return to the Workshop
We must now make a copy of the Mona Lisa So go to the fireplace and turn left to face the easel Click on the sheet to remove it from the easel Then bring out the four cans of Red Blue and Yellow Paints and Varnish one by one and place them in the slots under the canvas Now click on the Reference frame on your left to hear the hero's comment Bring out aNailfrom your Inventory and click on the frame to put it on its left edge Now bring outThe Mona Lisaand put it on the Reference frame We are now ready to make its copy
The Mona Lisa Puzzle This puzzle actually consists of three parts In the first part we have to make a charcoal sketch of the painting Don't worry though because no artistic talent is required So pick up the Charcoal Crayon lying to the right of the cans of paint and varnish and click on the boxes in the easel to turn the blank canvas into the sketch It is not as easy as it sounds however because while a click on one box might turn it into a piece of the sketch a click on another box might return the first box to blank canvas So click on the shaded boxes below in the order in which they have been numbered i e click first on box number then on then on etc
The sketch will be completed as you click on box number concluding the first part of the Mona Lisa puzzle Right click to put away the Charcoal Crayon and note the large black dots in the completed sketch In the second part of the puzzle we are supposed to be roughly painting the portrait Again no artistic talent is required Begin by clicking on each box It will look as if you were flipping each piece turning the sketch into a dull colored portrait but all the pieces of this portrait will appear to be jumbled up Now click on any one of the black dots and see how that rotates the four boxes around it Thus we must click on these dots to rearrange the pieces of the portrait until they form a coherent whole
Note I have often run into puzzles of this kind and found that while some people relish them others absolutely dread or detest them There is good news for the second group though As I was working on this puzzle one of my automatic programs kicked in minimizing the game to the task bar I closed that program and restored the game by clicking on its name at the bottom of the screen to find the puzzle solved As they say Serendipity brings Good Fortune But you don't need serendipity to solve this puzzle for you All you need is something to minimize the game to the task bar and Windows offers several ways of doing that For instance you can pressCTRL ALT DELETE The game would be minimized as the Windows Task Manager window will pop up Close that window and click on the name of the game at the bottom of the screen to return to the game and find the puzzle solved OR You can click on either one of theWINDOWS LOGOkeys that appear next to the ALT button on either side of the Spacebar The game would be minimized as the Start Menu will pop up You don't even have to close this menu because it will disappear as soon as you click on the name of the game at the bottom of the screen Once again you will return to the game to find the puzzle solved
Note I don't know if the above is just a technical bug in the game or a technique that the developers deliberately introduced to help out the gamers that dislike such puzzles But I did go back and try it with some other puzzles in this game to find that it works only with this particular puzzle
We will actually use some paint in the third part of the puzzle But again no artistic talent is required Just pick up the Paint Brush from the right of the Charcoal Crayon dip it inRed Paint then inVarnish and then clickTHREEtimes on your painting
Wipe off the red paint by clicking on the piece of cloth hanging down from the bottom right of the easel Now dip your brush inYellow Paint then inVarnish and then clickTHREEtimes on the painting again Wipe off the brush on the cloth once more
Finally dip your brush inBlue Paint then inVarnish and then clickTWICEon the painting Andvoila The painting is finished Right click to put away the paint brush Pick up your copy ofThe Mona Lisa and then the original to receive theSewing Spoolalong with the original
There is no use going back to the Dovecot because the hero will decline to put the copy ofThe Mona Lisawhere he had found the original So go to the Kitchen instead and click on Saturnin A dialog and a cut scene will follow Note The phrase quot a little over three hundred years ago quot in the cut scene is a typographical error of course because Saturnin also mentions the date i e justthreeyears before the events of the game Besides Saturnin himself was part of that cut scene event and he certainly can't be years old
In addition to information Saturnin gives the hero aWooden Bowand permission to take whatever the hero may like from the Barn So go out of the Store Room exit and into the Barn
Pick up the bowl ofSugar Return to the Store Room and pick up two handfuls ofCharcoal from the sack on the ground to the left of the staircase Note Once again you will not have any problems getting in and out of the Manor if you took the Diabolic approach in returning from the Dovecot with the Mona Lisa and are still dressed in theGuard's Uniform This is true even if you had been caught coming back You would have to check to make sure the guard is moving away from you however if you had taken the Angelic approach
Go up to Leonardo's Study If you were caught you can use the passage through the bookcase to return to Leonardo's bedroom of course and then go directly to his Study from there
Approach the lab area Feel free to refer to Leonardo's notes in the Portfolio about making Powder and Fumigants Then open the boiler door put in someCharcoal and use yourLighterto light up a fire Close the boiler door and remove theGooseneckfrom the top of the Still Put in the rest of the Water from yourOpened Bottle of Water Sugar Saltpetre one by one into the Still The hero will tell you that the product appears to be ready Bring out theIron Boxfrom your Inventory and click on the Still to retrieve theFumigant
Now put a handful ofCharcoalin the Mortar to your right Use the Pestle to grind it and then pick up theCharcoal Powder Bring out theCharcoal Powderfrom your Inventory and put it in the bowl to your right Bring out thePhial of Sulphurand add the Sulphur to the same bowl Finally addSaltpetreto the bowl as well
Pick up the explosive Powder
Go to the Workshop There is no use going down to its cellar because you will find that Hector is not there anymore So approach the sawing table instead Remove the thickDrill Bitand replace it with the thinnerDrill Bitfrom your Inventory Bring out theCrankfrom your Inventory and attach it to the side of the Drill Bit holder Now bring out theWooden Bowand put it under the Drill Bit Click on thegearicon on the Crank to drill a hole in the Wooden Bow Pick up both theCrankand theBow made of Perforated Wood
Go to the Kitchen now and down the Trap Door Cellar Note You won't need the Lamp anymore because there is plenty of light now from the chandelier
Go forward and turn right to face the Flying Machine Feel free to click on it to hear just what is wrong with it Bring theWooden Shaftfrom your Inventory and click anywhere on the Flying Machine to see the shaft attach to the machine's top front Now bring theBow made of Perforated Woodfrom your Inventory and click anywhere on the Flying Machine again to see it attach along the side of the machine Finally bring out theFumigantfrom your Inventory and put it on the ground next to a chest to the right of the Flying Machine
Return to the Kitchen to find that Saturnin is not at the table anymore Step in one of the following directions forward to the corner of the Kitchen to the right of the table with the bowl of eggs on it or to your left to the door leading to the Dining Room or through the door on your right to step out into the small hallway and thencome right backinto the Kitchen As you follow any of these directions you will hear a rumbling noise in the distance as well as a comment from the hero indicating that we have no choice but to use force
Go to the Workshop and try to approach the platform elevator but the hero will decline to take that route So go back to the Kitchen and down into the Trap Door Cellar Step forward and the camera will automatically pan to your left towards the bricked up door as the hero will make another comment Bring out theJackfrom your Inventory and click on the cannon below to place the Jack under it Now attach theCrankto the Jack and then click on thegearicon on the Crank to straighten the cannon Load theCannon Ballfrom the front end of the cannon Click on the small cover at the back of the cannon to open it Put your explosive Powderin this opening and the cover will close automatically Finally use yourLighter to light the fuse just behind the cover A short cut scene will show the cannon firing through the bricked up door
Go through that door to find Hector sprawled on the floor
Check your Conscience gauge and you will find that there is no loss in your Angelic gauge Pick up theManuscript by Leonardo Da Vinci lying just above Hector's left thigh A cut scene follows Hints of a sequel
Now there are two ways to get out of this place you can either go back to the cellar through the bricked up doorway you blew up or use the platform elevator summoning it by using the lever in the large gray cabinet to your left to go up to the Workshop Neither method will affect either your Conscience Gauge or your Bonus Score As you start to leave however the hero will indicate that we must leave the Mona Lisa painting here to the left of the bricked up doorway If you leave the copy your Angelic gauge will go down But if you leave the original your Diabolic score goes down Thus either way you will have to spend bonus points to restore balance in your Conscience gauge I suggest that youSAVEyour game first and then try it both ways to see how it affects the ending
Go to Babou's Sitting Room now and click on her to say your Farewells A cut scene follows If you had picked that second choice when you came to get the Chapel key from her and apologized to Babou for having lost your temper she will now ask the hero to take her with him You get a choice of two responses of course Feel free to use theSAVEI just suggested to try each response and then Sit back and enjoy the ending s

Blue lights special or how to get to top of mountain There are stands at the end of an incomplete bridge at one side of the tower
Each stand has switches
Flip a switch to see red lights on the bridge
Toggling the flipped switch turns off the lights
The object of the puzzle is tomake all lights blue using one switch on every panel
Solution A Left mouse click the stand to activate the puzzle
Study the pattern of the lights lit up by all switches on each stand
Label the standsL R as There might be a more logical solution to this puzzle but this is how I got it

Look for a combination of one switch on stand and stand that produce lights red and yellow on either side of the bridge
I found combinations that produced this a switch on stand and switch on stand b switch on stand and switch on stand c switch on stand and switch on stand

Then using one of the above combinations flip the switch on the rd panel to produce only yellow and blue lights
These eliminated and combination and and combination leaving switch on stand and switch on stand

Working with switch on stand and switch on stand only switch on stand produces yellow and blue lights

On the th stand on the right with L R and switches on the other stands flipped up find the panel that would light all blue
Solution B Dennis Note that each step can be lit only times
Knowing this you can come to the conclusion that the correct switches have a pattern that has a lights overlapping on ten steps for a total of lights
BUT with bases there is a possibility of a total of lights
So to solve it you can find the lights on each step hard way OR find the light that's off on each step so that there is on and off
I took each base and with each switch I wrote down the steps that were NOT lit
This takes time but eliminates guess work
When your done just look for a pattern of steps missing from
These are the switches that prevent more then lights on a step
Switch on base has steps unlit Switch on base has steps unlit Switch on base has steps unlit Switch on base has steps unlit
this generates a pattern from of UNLIT lights leaving each step to have lit lights on each step
Flip up on Stand switch Stand switch Stand switch Stand switch The bridge is now passable

Eska The crystal in this world is accessed by completely activating the giant shell at the center of the water village
You have to find the shells that control the giant shell
'Domains are just sketches
I created enough of them to test you now '
It is necessary to look around this village above water to get clues on puzzles
Green numbers are the location of the rope puzzles based on the number of ropes in the puzzle
Red numbers are the locations of the clues to rope puzzles based on the number of ropes in the puzzle
Blue numbers are the locations of the shells based on the number of notches there are on the rods
Drawing is not to scale and is for reference only
Colored ropes Go forward from the teleporter
Go left on the boardwalk forward and see L R red purple and blue ropes hanging from a box at right of path
We need clues for this puzzle
Turn right and forward the boardwalk across the teleporter
See a box with ropes yellow red green and blue hanging from it
Further down the boardwalk see blue yellow red green and purple ropes hanging from another box
Shells Turn left and forward inside the hut and see a shell on a stand
The shell has a rod sticking out of it with no notches on it
Shell puzzle The object of the puzzle is tolook for similar shells and press the buttons in correct order
There are of these shells around the water village
Press the button on the shell in sequence based on the notches on the rod
This rod with no notch is the first of the six
Press the button and see water pour from the giant shell in the water
Keep an eye out for the rest of the shells
Go forward to the next hut and left to see a pipe on the right wall
Pipe puzzle The object of the puzzle is to move the spine bridge to the center The bridge stays on the right if you pour too less water on the left if you pour too much water
Start with the largest valve to find the right amount of water
The pipe ends on a giant shell
In front of the shell is a lever
To the left is a spine bridge that needs to be adjusted so that we can cross to the other side
The pipe has wheels
The wheels are marked with lines gradations
The start has an arrow at one end
The amount of water released increases as the wheel goes clockwise which corresponds to the shape of the shell depicted inside the wheel
Above the wheels are drawings that show the size of the pipes that connects to the main pipe
The side pipes are controlled by the wheels
Solution This is how I did this a more logical explanation might be available Turn the wheel pull lever at end of bridge and see what the spine bridge does

Based on the clue start on the largest pipe which is the one on the right
Above the right wheel is a drawing of a large circle that has lines
Click on the wheel's th line clockwise from the arrowed line

Go to middle wheel
I selected a position line gradation going clockwise pull the lever at end of bridge and see if there is a result shown by the spine bridge
With the large right wheel at line I found that line position on the middle wheel keeps the spine bridge on the right little water while line position on the middle wheel moves the bridge to the left too much water Since we can add more water using the left wheel click the middle wheel to the the line clockwise little water

Go to left wheel
This has the smallest pipe as shown by the drawing above the wheel and can add water in small increments
With right wheel at th line and the middle wheel at th line Check which line will move the bridge to the center so you can cross
Click the left wheel to the th line clockwise
Note that the original position of the zero line of the wheel is under the U shape metal at top of the wheel and the thinnest part of the inner shell like object inside of the wheel is at the zero position
Click the correct line on the wheel
The wheel will bring that line under the U shape metal at top of wheel

Corabanti The crystal in this world is obtained by accessing the volcanic pumps and identifying them with their corresponding lights
Listen to Dormeuse
Look around the lava encircled volcanic island
Look through the telescope and see glyphs marking bridge segments across the lava
Cross the bridge go left and see that of these outlying bridges with glyphs surround the island
A very active volcano is off shore
Talk to Dormeuse at one of the clearing
Building Enter the central building tower
Look around and note the drawing in the open book on the table
The crystal is behind a fence across the exit stairs
A giant wheel is on one side
Climb the stairs and stand on the ramp that has a red button stand
Press the red button and rise to the top of the tower
Summary The main aim at Corabanti is to get the crystal in the building
The crystal is behind a gate
To lower the gate the giant wheel inside the building must be turned
To turn the wheel there must be power
The power is derived from volcanic pumps
There are outlying sets of bridges surrounding the main island
At far end of those bridges are islands one of which has a volcanic pump You have to reach those pumps and turn them on Puzzle one Lava bridge puzzle is to get to the pumps
Puzzle volcanic pump puzzle is to turn on those pumps
Tower At the top of the tower look out to the lava bridges
At the center of the room is a console that has panels of glyphs
Lava bridge puzzle The object of the puzzle is tobuild paths to all volcanic pumps These paths rotate only when they can make a connection with an already built path
The central console has all the glyphs that are found on the lava bridges
Each glyph is found on a segment of the bridges outside
There are no duplicated glyphs on the bridges or on the console
You have to make a continuous bridge to reach the pump
Each outlying set of bridges are made up of bridge segments that are disarranged
Each bridge segment is labeled with a symbol On top of the tower in the building is a console that turns those bridge segments based on the symbols that you can see through the telescope

Study a group of bridges that you are going to connect by looking out the window
Plan a path from the start to the volcanic pump that looks like a tower on one of the outlying island
Make note whether the segment is straight or angled

Go down out of the building and go to the telescope to view the glyphs closer on the targeted bridges
Use the telescope and note draw the glyphs that are on the bridges that you plan to rotate to make a path to the volcanic pump

Go back up to the tower and start at the bridge segment closest to the main island
Using the console look for the glyph for the segment you want to rotate
Press that glyph until you have turned the bridge segment according to your plan
Cycle the panel of glyphs using the arrow at the base of the panel
Turn the bridge segments as necessary until there is a path to the pump tower

There are pumps
The last pump is hidden behind the hill and is a continuation of the bridges that are left of the hill
Solution Volcanic pump puzzles The object of the puzzle is to place frame the appropriate colored light on the pump's base
A volcanic pump is found on one of the outlying island off a set of bridges
The volcanic pumps look like towers with covered colored lights on the length of the base
At the base of the pump is a movable frame window that shows the colored lights
In front of each pump is a wheel that raises or lowers the tower to show or hide the colored lights

Inside the building is a book that gives a clue to what color is to be selected for the volcanic pumps at the end of the arranged bridges
The lines are the placement in the sequence ex line blue means blue is in position

The position is from top to bottom i e
is on top and the last one is the th position
It can also be done bottom to top i e
is on top and the last one is the st position Dennis

Go to each volcanic pump and move the wheel to see all the lights at the base of the pump

Find the light that corresponds to the book clue's position and place it on the frame window
Ex If you move the wheel and see that the blue light is at top position then place the frame window to show the blue light
Do all the pumps
Once the volcanic pump colors are set it is time to arrange the lava bridge to reach the th volcanic pump
th bridge arrangement and th volcanic pump The object of the puzzle is to arrange the bridge segments left of the hill in order to access the th volcanic pump
The hill hides more bridge segments and the th volcanic pump

Rearrange the 'left of the hill bridge segments to access the segments behind the hill

Walk the bridge and see that bridge segments behind the hill are not arranged for access to the th volcanic pump

Study the segments to see how many turns are needed for them to make a path to the pump

Go to tower and move the unseen bridge segments using the console
Go down and check the segments

When the path is completed go to the th volcanic pump and place the red light that is in the th position on the frame
If all volcanic pump lights are placed correctly see the wheel inside the building turn and the fence to the crystal goes down
Go the building and take thecrystal
Go to the teleporter

If correctly done the elevators are activated
Flashing beams alignment puzzles The object of the puzzle is to synchronize all the beams All beams synchronized would release the piston and activate the elevator
There are towers
There are beams shot out from the beacon tower Climb up any of the activated tower elevator
Go to the stand at end of the platform

Look close at stand and see clasp all around the circle
The clasp when clicked on will activate the beacon tower to shoot a beam to the tower you are on

Watch and note the beam shot out from a tower that you want to synch with
You have to synch the beam that is projected to the tower you are on with one of the beams shot from the beacon tower by clicking on one of the clasp
Once one of the tower beam matches the one you are on go to the next unmatched tower and match that beam to the that you already synched

Finally follow the same procedure for the last out of synch tower to match the synched beam of the towers
Once all beams of the beacon tower are synched you will see the result
Dennis First timing is not important here but you do have to understand that there are eight different positions that the beams can flash at
Think of it as a circle divide into segments of degree's
Now if you press the first metal clasp on the rim of the wheel you advance the beam flash by degrees
The second clasp advances the beam degrees and the third degrees and so on
Once you have selected the beam that you want to synchronize you can quot judge quot how many degrees your beam is away and select the appropriate clasp OR as just keep selecting the first clasp shifting it by degree's until it is synchronized
Then move to the next tower and again quot judging quot the degree's off OR press the first clasp shifting degree's until synchronized with the first two towers
Once the beams are in synch the base of the beacon tower drops the beams stop flashing and the manhole at the central island opens
Go to the central island and climb on the platform with railings formerly the manhole
The platform goes down to ground level
Exit walk to the left and around the rim of the enclosure

SERPENTHEAD Revisited WALKTHROUGH Demo amp Full Game th April Len Green lengreen hotmail com PREFACE Although you never get lsquo killed rsquo it rsquo s worth while saving frequently to conserve time There are an unlimited number of save slots and all saves are extremely small and quick loading There is quite a bit of non linearity and hence flexibility in ldquo SerpentHead Revisited rdquo In the full game you must work through until you reach a single and evident end sequence You can do this in many different orders certainly not necessarily that below which I took However there are frequent actions which you cannot perform until they are lsquo triggered rsquo by certain previous actions generally logical which are prerequisites In the demo there are various entrances well labeled which you can rsquo t enter and hence some locations are blocked off There are places in the demo walkthru where the full game differs somewhat hellip see A etc
and A etc Furthermore in the demo ONLY there are somewhat different sequences which you MUST finish in order to complete it hellip You have to finish ALL these in the full game also but this ALONE is far from sufficient to finish it
Different players are likely to complete these in different orders When you have completed ALL THREE you obtain a clear full page notification that you have finished the demo This notification will appear when the last of the is completed hellip in whichever of the locations this occurs I have described here ONLY the particular order in which I personally played the game The possible ending points are marked in the demo walkthru with a triple asterisk thus hellip hellip hellip

DEMO Approach Castle SerpentHead Look at the loose brick close to the left side of the arched entrance
Take the silver key from under the loose brick
Enter the castle and turn E Look at the sheet of paper pinned to the wall with a dagger
Read the contents of the sheet of paper and note its hints

Copy down the symbol there the Greek upper case letter lsquo Phi rsquo and note roughly where you found it
Look at approximately the left armpit of the same plumed knight A small piece of the shiny metal armor is apparently loose
Take the shiny piece of metal

Open it and enter N Try to open the heavy wooden door You can rsquo t because there rsquo s no latch or whatever

Remove the pane stick your hand through the hole and unlatch the door
Enter the chapel
Look at the closed tabernacle It won rsquo t open
Rotate the golden cross once only
Look VERY HARD ALL OVER the left hand stained glass window and find the active position about at the same level as the center of the cross
Get a reflected beam of light and heat which lights the left hand candle
Rotate the golden cross twice more
Repeat for the right hand stained glass window
Get a reflected beam of light and heat which lights the right hand candle
Rotate the golden cross once more only which returns it to its initial position
Open the tabernacle and take the golden Cross Return to where the dagger was and continue one more frame W Look N and see the locked door
Open this locked door with the silver key and enter
Ignore the spider and its web for now anyway Climb the stairs NW At the top you can go forward or W In the demo you cannot go E In the full game you can go E hellip but you can rsquo t make any progress there at present
Go forward twice Look at the golden throne and LOOK VERY HARD ALL OVER the heavy red drapes
Look particularly a little way along from the left hand edge side and you rsquo ll see a darker vertical streak This is a cord
Pull this cord and the drapes open
Go forward once again and you are confronted with the image of Cendric
Try to go forward again and the image will not allow you to proceed yet anyway telling you that ldquo hellip hellip hellip
Only the King may pass rdquo
Return once then take a close up look at the golden cabinet There is a single drawer in it which is locked
Using your golden key unlock the drawer and open it
Pick up the royal ring from inside the drawer
Look at the sheet of paper in the drawer It gives you some important instructions concerning a future puzzle involving symbols You can rsquo t take the paper or use the instructions now but you can copy them or else return to them whenever you DO need them
Close the drawer and exit the close up
Return twice to the top of the stairs hellip where you were before and go W You are in a location that has a metallic looking door with Greek letters engraved on it and a gold cat statue
You can arbitrarily press on symbols and hear noises You can also press on a slit in the middle of the left side of the entrance You rsquo ll hear a growl the cat turns black with fury and you get a warning that ldquo hellip hellip hellip hellip hellip The wizard rsquo s cat is ready to attack rdquo But there is nothing USEFUL you can do there at the moment
Go W You will find yourself at the bottom of another set of lsquo stairs without a spider rsquo Look VERY HARD ALL OVER the walls
If you haven rsquo t found it look just to the left of the flame of the torch Copy down the symbol there the Greek lower case letter lsquo delta rsquo and note roughly where you found it
Go up these stairs Here at the top you can go forward or E or W Go forward Your passage is blocked at present by a dragon who ldquo hellip hellip doesn rsquo t look very friendly rdquo
Return to the top of the stairs and go E Go forward once and then E once You are in a library The books you are able to read give substantial clues for the continuation of the game
Read the book hellip ldquo History of SerpentHead rdquo A In the full game only you should also read the other book next to it ldquo History of the Land rdquo hellip hellip hellip hellip hellip
B hellip hellip hellip
hellip hellip Cross over to the other side of the library and read more books ldquo The Royal Mages rdquo and ldquo The Line of Ethorian Kings rdquo
Look at the corner stone on the wall to the left of the History books and at about the same height as them
Copy down the symbol there the Greek upper case letter lsquo Theta rsquo and note roughly where you found it
Return to the top of the stairs Go W Look VERY HARD ALL OVER the walls
If you haven rsquo t found it look just to the left of the right elbow of King Ethor rsquo s statue Copy down the symbol there an upside down English letter lsquo A rsquo and note roughly where you found it This is the last of the symbols that you need to view and recognize
Look at the left hand of King Ethor rsquo s statue Put the royal ring on its finger After having been turned into stone by the lsquo Dark Sorcerer rsquo he returns to life Queen Sophia also King Ethor gives you his crown ldquo hellip hellip hellip to appease the ghost of Cendric rdquo and the King and Queen accompany you onwards in your quest
Take the wrench from the wall behind where King Ethor rsquo s statue stood
Try to open the door to the right of where the statues stood No good There is some sort of locking mechanism bolting it shut
There is a somewhat gold colored circle on the door with a cross on it Maybe your cross will fit it But no again ldquo It looks like it would fit except there is some sort of locking device blocking it rdquo
Unblock the locking mechanism using your wrench
You can NOW fit your gold cross onto the cross on the door
There is a switch on the right hand wall Press the cross and then the switch Repeat this another times N B
You may have to press the switch again and the door opens
Enter the room with a bookcase
Look at and read the spell books some of the info will be helpful later on
There is nothing else to do in that room so you can leave hellip hellip hellip

Return to the top of the stairs and go down hellip no spider there Go E and you rsquo re in the lsquo cat room rsquo
Hopefully you noted down all of the symbols and roughly where you found them and also the list you found in the drawer of the throne room If so it should be easy to press the appropriate symbols on the metal door once each only and in their correct order If however you rsquo re stuck for any reason the graphic at the end of this demo walkthru shows you how to do it Press the symbols once only each in the order of the graphic from left to right
The metal door opens You cannot enter in the demo but you can in the full game Notice that at the same time the door opened the golden cat statue collapsed
Use the collapsed cat statue to open the lid of the chest
Take the bottles on the left You can rsquo t actually use them in the demo hellip but you will need all or some of them in the full game
Take the other bottles No go ldquo You can rsquo t carry any more bottles rdquo
But you can replace those bottles and THEN take the other bottles on the right Whenever you like you can always swap one or more bottles but you can rsquo t carry more than at any one time
Go W You are at the bottom of the set of lsquo stairs without a spider rsquo Go up the stairs and forward again to the dragon IT rsquo S WORTH WHILE SAVING HERE
Try to kill him with your dagger You can rsquo t You rsquo ll have to distract him
In your inventory use the potent asp venom on your piece of stained glass It quickly dissolves the softer glass coating revealing the harder legendary Eye of Xanaria embedded inside
Put the Eye of Xanaria on the dragon Now rsquo s your chance but you must act QUICKLY
Stab the dragon in the chest with your dagger and it collapses hellip dead
Look at the dragon and you get a close up
Take his still beating heart hellip Ugh
You get your dagger back as well
You are facing a brick wall You cannot go forward hellip so return
The wall has disappeared and so has the dragon rsquo s body There is now just a black empty opening to the N and entrances to the E and W The demo won rsquo t allow you to proceed through any of them
hellip but in the full game you can enter them all hellip hellip hellip

Put the green test tube near to the top of the balcony wall and catch a fly with your cupped hand
Return to the spider in the center of its web see
IT rsquo S WORTH WHILE SAVING HERE Put the fly onto the top of the web The spider moves up to get it
QUICKLY grab some spider rsquo s web before it returns to the center
Return towards the laboratory Note the mouse hole at the bottom of the dark left hand column at the entrance to the laboratory
Enter the laboratory
Pour the contents of your red amp blue test tubes the order is unimportant into the lab jar hellip obtaining a permanent purple foam at the top of it
Put the ingredients needed for the lsquo shrinking spell rsquo into the bowl the order is unimportant hellip you get a small purple froth as you add each one
When you have put all correct ingredients in you obtain a permanent purple foam at the top of the bowl If you don rsquo t get this purple foam you haven rsquo t put in the correct items which are hellip i Toenail of bat ii dragon heart iii spider web iv Liver of toad v Pureed wasp
Grab the handle of the lab jar and the purple foam from the lab jar will be poured over the mixture in the bowl This will make you shrink and transport you to outside the mouse hole You won rsquo t stay that way very long but you can always easily return using the same method as when you arrived
Enter the mouse hole The rat inside as big or bigger than you are snarls ferociously at you and won rsquo t let you pass

Take the gauntlet
Exit the mouse hole and automatically return to normal size
Go to the crystal room which you reach by entering the now open lsquo symbols door rsquo in the lsquo cat room rsquo see

So use the gauntlet to pick it up
Go to the place where the dragon rsquo s body disappeared and go W You are in a room with an illuminated book Read the book It rsquo s impossible to read It is illegible since it is written in some sort of hieroglyphics

Return to the balcony and approach the wall
Look at the wall close up One stone is soft and porous
Use your dagger and begin etching letters in the soft stone
Continue until you have letters ldquo A rdquo in one row
Now what was that riddle in the illuminated book
Left hand page hellip third letter of each of the names hellip A L D H E N ldquo Not in order rdquo i e
an anagram
It would appear to be ldquo handle rdquo
Using your dagger at the top of each letter changes it to the next letter in the alphabet and using it at the bottom of each letter changes it to the previous letter in the alphabet
Inscribe the magic word
Go to the entrance of the laboratory where you saw the mouse hole At the top of the arch there is a brownish colored handle
Pull it downwards

Beneath the lsquo star book rsquo is a small telescope Take it
Return to the balcony not too close and look at the group of stars in the sky near to the right edge of your monitor Hey That looks just like ldquo Serpens rdquo
Look at ldquo Serpens rdquo through your small telescope WOW A clock comes flying down from the sky Pick it up
Did you notice a spell in one of the spell books that requires i scale of fish ii adder rsquo s fork You probably haven rsquo t got both of them in your inventory If that rsquo s the case go to the lsquo cat chest rsquo and swap ANY bottles for those
In your inventory rub once only the scale of fish and then the adder rsquo s fork on your piece of metal
Look at it hellip it rsquo s now magnetized
Go to the place where the dragon rsquo s body disappeared and go forward
Go forward again There rsquo s a force field which won rsquo t allow you to advance
Look at the middle of the horizontal dividing line between the dark floor bricks and the yellow tiles There rsquo s a crack in the floor there
Wedge the piece of magnetic metal into the crack and the force field is diverted to the magnet

So carve a foothold in the stone of the pedestal with your dagger
Climb onto the pedestal You are facing a blue wall
Press the blue wall and the SerpentScepter appears Try to take it hellip no go It rsquo s enveloped in a swirling ether cloud
Put your clock on it You get a sort of a timepiece with clock faces
Remember the threesomes in the riddle Dial on each of the faces

Go to outside the mouse hole Set the crystal down on the uneven stone floor beside the large mouse hole hellip so that it won rsquo t shrink with the rest of you It rolls inside the hole
Enter the laboratory

S H A D Y B R O O K Puzzles Walkthrough Len Green rd July lengreen hotmail com PREFACE I am a very poor raconteur so this walkthrough contains only dry instructions without narrative s In my opinion however the story is the best part of the game
My apologies in advance
The st time you play the game you have a choice of lsquo non standard rsquo modes hellip that is if you want to choose either or both
Quotefromthegame rsquo sopening Be warned however that though the overall game will not be affected ndash you may miss certain details pertaining to the plot if you activate either or both of these modes
I CHOSE NEITHER OF THESE OPTIONS AND THIS WALKTHROUGH IS BASED UPON THE FULL GAME I would personally recommend others to do likewise
Censored Mode This mode removes any disturbing violent and sexual scenes Although in my opinion there is no content which does not appear in standard family TV and films Incidentally there is absolutely NO bad language in the game
Adventure Only Mode This mode removes a few sequences which depend upon timing amp or reflexes
Although again in my opinion there are no REALLY DIFFICULT sequences of this nature
INTRODUCTION A This lsquo puzzles walkthrough rsquo as the name implies describesonlytheMAJORpuzzles in the game There are also a number of lsquo secondary rsquo puzzles which can easily be missed as I well know to my mortification
These do not spoil your continuation and conclusion of the game hellip but cause you to miss some worthwhile content hellip and of course points L The Author and Developer Christopher M Brendel has published a fullcompanion guidein which a complete run down of the game in ALL its aspects is described hellip containing amongst MANY other details afull and comprehensive walkthrough includingALLof the puzzles point scores Easter Eggs etc etc
B The game is so rich in characters who are continuously moving to different locations in the town and at different times that I am not attempting any ordinary walkthrough Apart from anything else the narrative is so gripping that it would be a pity to anticipate it
C Despite the fact that Shady Brook is a very small town there are nevertheless a dozen different locations to visit and explore Since my sense of direction is not very good I am not describing how to travel from place to place There is an in game map which helps but it doesn rsquo t lsquo transport rsquo you magically to the different locations hellip you have to find your way yourself or with help from Chris rsquo scompanion guide
I have added a list of all the locations you will have to visit during the game at the end of this walkthrough hellip see
D Probably due to a combination ofall of the above I personally dropped quite a number of the maximum possible points hellip I rsquo m not going to mention how manyL
E At some stage s in the game your notebook and valuable onscreen prompts indicate objectives to perform and flag you when completed
F The puzzles are listed in the order in which they appear during the game Most of the solutions are graduated line by line to different extents so that the reader may decide to stop using them at any stage and continue independently through to the end G Some puzzles need the solution from a previous one before they can be solved
H There are quite a few puzzles which are NOT described in this walkthrough hellip but will only bereferred to AT THE END in passing
i e Those puzzles which randomly reset each play and those which involve lsquo mild rsquo action and for which FULL instructions and help are given in the game itself making them quite superfluous to repeat here
How toopen the safe in the master bedroom
The master bedroom is locked hellip before anything else you need to get inside
Look under the fireplace mantelpiece
There is a key glued there
You must find a way to release the key
The glue needs to be softened This can be done by heating
You rsquo ll want a box of matches from the General Store
Use your wallet to buy them
Warm the glue with the matches
Take the key

The number is hellip click it in close up note it and exit the puzzle s
This is the number you need to open the safe in the master bedroom See
You can now return thereand open that safe
Enter the above number pull the handle and the safe opens revealing a circular opening which you can only deal with later See
There is also a coded poem which gives some hints for later on in the game You CAN decode it NOW I did
But it is very much better and far easier to wait until after you have finished when you will obtain automatic access to a very useful mechanism which helps greatly in deciphering See
Kate rsquo s washing
View the close up of the instruction card between the cups There are tasks to perform
Since the blue bottle is the fabric softener the red bottle whose label is hidden at present must be the laundry detergent

Click on the washing machine rsquo s middle button the smaller one between the larger ones The washing cycle begins and a cut scene between Jake and Kate ensues
hellip WITH AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT HINT see SPOILERS IN THEIR DIALOG
Deciphering the coded poem
This puzzle could have been solved earlier See the end of and indeed I personally DID so without knowing that there was a very helpful mechanism to make the puzzlemuch easier
In any case this puzzle which is not very difficult for native English speakers maybe insuperable for some people whose English is not their first language
However the following should enableanybodyto solve it At the end are graduated spoilers
Although it is probably not be the best way the following is howIpersonally did it hellip there are of course MANY other alternative methods In inventory click on the coded poem and you obtainGraphic
Click on that and you rsquo ll get the lsquo decryption device rsquo seeGraphic
The original coded document lines covers most of the top part of the screen It is clearer than the original and colored blue
Beneath it in a single line and also colored blue but much larger is the English alphabet
There is quite a lot of trial and error involved in the following There are only two English words of one letter ldquo A rdquo and ldquo I rdquo which must therefore be represented in the coded version by ldquo Q rdquo and ldquo U rdquo
By some sort of reasoning and possibly trial and error I figured that ldquo Q rdquo probably represented ldquo I rdquo and ldquo U rdquo probably represented ldquo A rdquo
So you click first on a ldquo Q rdquo in the text and then on the ldquo I rdquo in the bottom alphabet EVERY ldquo Q rdquo in the coded document then turns instantly into an ldquo I rdquo Then you click first on a ldquo U rdquo in the text and then on the ldquo A rdquo in the bottom alphabet EVERY ldquo U rdquo in the coded document then turns instantly into an ldquo A rdquo Each time you substitute any letter the substitution occurs for EVERY occurrence of that letter You should continuously look to see if ANY clashes occur hellip i e
words or parts of words which are impossible
e g
ldquo igto rdquo ldquo breod rdquo ldquo opered rdquo etc etc
It rsquo s worth while noting down lsquo successful rsquo substitutions as you proceed
I then looked at the several letter words beginning with ldquo A rdquo or ldquo I rdquo
the nd last letter is probably ldquo M rdquo ldquo S rdquo or ldquo T rdquo
From this I deduced partially guessed maybe
that ldquo G rdquo probably represented ldquo T rdquo and ldquo F rdquo probably represented ldquo S rdquo
So you click first on a ldquo G rdquo in the text and then on the ldquo T rdquo in the bottom alphabet
And likewise you click first on an ldquo F rdquo in the text and then on the ldquo S rdquo in the bottom alphabet
I then noticed that there were two letter coded words ldquo GR rdquo On the assumption that ldquo G rdquo represents ldquo T rdquo then ldquo R rdquo MUSTrepresent ldquo O rdquo
So you click first on an ldquo R rdquo in the text and then on the ldquo O rdquo in the bottom alphabet
I then saw that in the top line after a probable title there appeared the lsquo word rsquo ldquo IMTO rdquo Clearly the ldquo M rdquo MUSTrepresent ldquo N rdquo
So you click first on an ldquo M rdquo in the text and then on the ldquo N rdquo in the bottom alphabet
Now look at the second line down from the top It seems most likely that it indicates that the document was written by the previous owner of the house who ldquo passed away rdquo and left it in his locked safe
So it rsquo s not far fetched to exchange about letters
The second line should now read ldquo BY ANTHONY CLAVE rdquo seeGraphic
You have now deciphered just over a half of the alphabet It should now be fairly easy to carry on through observation trial and error eliminating lsquo impossibles rsquo etc
until you complete the whole document seeGraphic
Graphic CAUTION Both in the above and in the following SPOILER you must take great care hellip as follows The following is just one example but it applies throughout the whole lsquo process rsquo hellip hellip hellip hellip
Looking at the very top line it rsquo s obvious that you have to click first on the ldquo I rdquo underlined in redin the text and then on the ldquo U rdquo in the bottom alphabet seeGraphic
HOWEVER take care NOT to click first on the ldquo I rdquo underlined ingreenin the text and then on the ldquo U rdquo in the bottom alphabet The reason is hellip the ldquo I rdquo underlined ingreenin the text is NOT an lsquo ORIGINAL rsquo symbol in the coded poem It was originally not an ldquo I rdquo but a ldquo Q rdquo
YOU MUST ONLY SUBSTITUTE ORIGINAL LETTERS
Graphic SPOILERS Kate Ekan while Jake is doing the laundry see tells you the title of the poem which is quot THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE quot This is the top line of the document
The second line down from the top indicates that the document was written by the previous owner of the house who ldquo passed away rdquo and left it in his locked safe So the second line down should be ldquo BY ANTHONY CLAVE rdquo The above spoilers give you a huge start with substitutes over half of the letters in the alphabet
Taking into account the abovecaution hellip hellip ldquo Q rdquo changes to ldquo I rdquo ldquo A rdquo changes to ldquo M rdquo ldquo H rdquo changes to ldquo D rdquo ldquo L rdquo changes to ldquo K rdquo ldquo T rdquo changes to ldquo P rdquo ldquo Z rdquo changes to ldquo W rdquo ldquo K rdquo changes to ldquo G rdquo The mirrors puzzle
If by any chance you have trouble with this puzzle please see the very end of this
Go through the gap in the railings and arrive at the bridge
At the left side of the screen is a mirror Graphic and at the extreme right edge of the screen is a second mirror
Go forward and cross the bridge and move forward once more
Move once to the left and notice the pile of stones
Move left twice more and observe a third mirror Graphic Observe this third mirror in close up
When you sweep your cursor over the surface of each of the mirrors arrows are displayed hellip an up down and horizontal arrow Graphic
Graphic Click the down arrow and the notch on the circumference of the mirror goes up
Exit the close up and move right once and you arrive at the bridge again
Cross the bridge back again and move forward once more
Move right once and you will befacingthe bridge as previously
Once again notice the mirror at the left side of the screen
Observe that abovementioned mirror in close up
Click the up arrow and the notch on the circumference of the mirror goes down
See how the light beams travel and in particular where they end up
If by any chance you have trouble with this puzzle check that the notch on the mirror at the right edge of the screen which you shouldn rsquo t have touched
is set in the lsquo middle position rsquo If not set it and start again from the beginning
Exit the close up
Go forward and cross the bridge again and move forward once more
Move once to the left and examine the pile of stones
This time pick up the lsquo half amulet rsquo
The following puzzles are only listed briefly together with general descriptions only They are all puzzles which randomly reset each play amp or those which involve lsquo mild rsquo action and for which FULL instructions and help are given in the game itself making them quite superfluous to repeat here
The gas station Pipes puzzle
The object of this puzzle is to obtain one continuous connection of glowing pipes from the left edge of the screen to the right edge You can rotate the pipes by clicking on them If a pipe connects to a glowing pipe then both pipes will glow The initial orientation of each pipe is random and so there is no specific strategy to solving this puzzle The best advice I can give is to try to stay on the upper half of the screen and ignore all of the pipes on the lower half Good luck
You can ldquo Give Up rdquo and skip this puzzle
There is certainly more than one way of succeeding hellip however seeGraphic for one such solution
Graphic The pool game

The museum also serves as the impressive residence of Lord Montcalfe a student of the antiquities who has seemingly passed his passion for archeology as well as other traits on to his loving daughter Elisabeth But alas Lord Montcalfe has come up missing and his adoring daughter has thoughtfully engaged Sherlock her distant cousin to find her missing father You as Sherlock become a part of the unfolding mystery solo sans Watson as you enter the museum in search of the missing Lord
Be aware that puzzle content and frequency becomes increasingly more difficult as you progress in the game Good luck Sherlock
LEVEL THE RECEPTION HALL Walk around the hall and examine the sarcophagi and take note of the later of the two dates shown under each one
AE ME NK BE or OK MK NK LD When you have collected the dates above go to the front door and you'll see a lion statue on each side
Go to the left side and click on the statue
A secret compartment will open it the wall
You're right its your first puzzle
Very straight forward stuff here
Just enter the dates in the right location and click the diamond shaped button on the right
A panel under the staircase will open
Go over and pick up theKEY Go around to the other side of the stairs and pick up an AnubisSEALfrom the potted plant
THE EXHIBIT ROOMS Turn around and use the key on the locked doors behind you Enter the room Go left and pick up a secondSEALbehind the seated statue at the far left of the room Turn around and approach the mummy case room center Look down
Open the tool box and extract the tools
You should retrieve anOIL FLASK aHAMMER WITH LEVER and aSCREWDRIVER
Turn and look up to examine the Khaepaseth mummy Look at the wall mounted display of the curse of the mummy Turn around and check out the glass display case The documents are quot illegible quot Note the scraps and papers thrown everywhere
Someone has ransacked the place
Go to the door at the end of the room right of the display case Turn right and pick up the goldTIE PINunder the blue topped foot stool Swing back left and enter the next room Go forward right once toward the black Anubis sculpture Pick up the thirdSEALon the floor to the left
Swing slightly left and examine the sacrificial knife on the lower shelf of the cabinet
You might want to remember just where it is for later reference
Pan around to room center and look at the large black statue of Amenophis Go forward once to the end of the room There's a double door to your left and one ahead of you
Examine the pictures on the way between the doors and pick up thePHOTO OF ELISABETH MONTCALFE Click on the picture
Click on the enlarged picture
If you lose track of it its gone into your quot letters quot inventory as will many other documents to come
The left and right arrows allow you to page through the documents you collect
Scan through your letter file often to refresh your memory and gain hints to the progression of the story
The letter urges your caution as the mansion is said to be quot full of traps quot Look down on the floor in front of the door to the right and in front of you Pick up thePIECE OF BANDAGE Cross the room and examine the glass mummy case on the opposite side of the room Return to the double doors at the back and side by the pictures of the room and check out the symbols Looks like maybe you'll need four of those seals before you can get through those doors The other door is locked and you've yet to find the key
So return through this room and go out through the opposite door Pass through the room The door to the stairs is on your left
Open the door at the end to see another exhibit area
Go left to examine the excerpt from quot The Book of the Dead quot in the glass display case Examine the burial urns on the chest to the right Go forward and turn left to examine the display bearing the images of various god and goddesses
Take careful note of the little statues and their various duties in caring for the ancient Egyptian population
The door at the end of the room is also locked
Pan right of that door and examine the stone hieroglyph The camera will move to the side door but look back and pick up the fourthSEALdown and right on the floor The side door is also locked Turn right Go down the side of the room past the central open sarcophagus bearing the mummy and click on the second from the left statue along the wall The statue will move aside revealing a locked compartment
Makes you wish for a ring full of skeleton keys However in this case the crafty Sherlock remarks that it appears this lock might be broken Use your screwdriver to break the padlock Open the compartment and extract a silverKEY You will lose the screwdriver as you will other items but don't be concerned
You'll never need it again and its just one less thing to pack around
Go back to the left and use your oil flask on the side wall set of locked doors Then use the silver key you just found beneath the statue The doors are quot unlocked quot Open the doors Hmmm looks like this room has never been converted to a display area Maybe its been used for storage and for unpacking exhibits as they arrive at the museum Walk directly across the room and have a look in the big mirror
Yippeeee ki yo its a scary mummy He obviously isn't thrilled about your being here but he doesn't appear to want to actually take your life At least not yet
Go to the right and take a good look at those boxes on the floor It appears that one of them might possibly be opened Use your hammer from inventory to whack the box a good one and extractBIG MIDDLE andLITTLE GEAR WHEELSand a fifthSEAL Be sure to click on the box again to add some WOOD to your inventory Go on past the boxes to the end of the room Look at the large cupboard against the end wall Use the gold tie pin from your inventory to unlock the doors Remove theBOTTLE OF WHISKEY
Leave the room Turn left and go forward through the adjacent two rooms and down to the end of the third where there is a double door on the end and another on your left You've been here before remember Turn left at the end of the room the view the door displaying four seals
The Seal Puzzle Place the four required seals from your inventory as follows Top Sobek master of the waters
He looks like a crocodile's right facing profile nd Ibis bird left facing profile with long beak rd Nout a women stretching horizontally on all fours th Opposite facing twins The statues shown in the display case really didn't help a whole bunch here right Sherlock
Open that door Looks like you're inside Lord Montcalfe's study
THE STUDY Walk forward once and pick up thePAPERSfrom the desk Also read the quot A Strange Philanthropist quot article clipped from the newspaper about Lord Montcalfe's aspirations to present the mummy of the priest of Khaepaseth
From the desk go back left to the other desk near the room's end wall Pick up theMATCHESand look at the open document which appears to have some pages missing Use the matches on the candlestick at the lower left corner of the desk
Look up at the wall ahead of you and go forward once Turn left and open the fire box on the wood heater Put the papers inside you just collected from the first desk Use the bottle of whiskey on the papers inside the fire box Next use the wood from the broken Turn right to the strange mechanical door security device on the wall Insert the big middle and little gear wheels from inventory into the appropriate places
Turn back to the open stove door and use your matches to ignite the material you placed in the heater's fire box In a cutscene the locked doors will open and you Sherlock will be finally allowed to enter Montcalfe's obviously prestigious library
LEVEL THE LIBRARY With your back to the double doors turn right and pick up the bright blueHISTORY BOOKfrom behind the white pillar Go up the spiral stairs behind you in the left corner of the room Go left and forward to the bookcase with bright blue books While holding the blue book you found behind the pillar click on the book on the second row right side The bright blue History book will properly store itself and you'll have a bright greenRELIGION BOOKin your inventory Aha so that's how it works Let's repeat this exercise a few more times tidy up the library and maybe find a clue or two to Montcalfe's disappearance along the way Find the bookcase with bright green books
Exchange the green book while picking up a bright redGEOGRAPHY BOOK Go back down the spiral stairs and over to the far left corner of the room from the stairs where you'll see the bright red books Replace the light bluePHILOSOPHY BOOKwith the red book Sherlock just may be a victim of obsessive compulsive disorder don't you think Or maybe he missed a greater calling as a librarian
Now holding the Philosophy book go to the other end of the room in the right corner opposite the spiral stairs On the second shelf of the bookcase with the blue books exchange the one you are carrying for the blackLAW BOOK Take the black law book back up the stairs till you're facing the bookcase with all black books Exchange the one you have with the yellowSCIENCE BOOKon the right side of the second shelf
Now go back down the stairs
Go slightly right and forward to the yellow books Exchange the yellow book with the whitePHILOSOPHY BOOKon the left side second shelf Exchange this philosophy book with another large white may look blue book in the third shelf right in the middle Its within this philosophy book that Sherlock finally finds what he didn't know he was looking for anotherKEY Go to the large table and examine the papers and the news article then go back up the spiral stairs and use that newly won key to open the locked door along the gallery
THE HALLWAY Turn left and look at the ancient statue which Sherlock cryptically remarks quot is not ancient quot Remember this statue
Though seemingly useless for a long period of time it will play an important role later
Are you still able to recall where you saw that sacrificial knife No matter If you don't I'll remember for you when the critical time comes
THE PARLOR Turn back and enter the green draped door ahead of you
You'll be facing a set of double wooden doors Turn left and walk to the corner to examine the empty sarcophagus Sherlock remarks that it looks like Momphis XI seems to have gone for a stroll
Now how likely is that Note the sand When you back out of the picture look right to examine the wall mounted rifle then go forward turn right and click on the lavender colored draperies to reveal another door Let's continue our examination of this room first however Look down in front of the sofa and pick up the note from Elizabeth She didn't tell you she'd studied archeology did she Wonder why she wouldn't mention that
Turn left and walk toward the fireplace
Examine the mounted lion's head over the mantle
A hunting trophy no doubt Continue left and look at the large corner cabinet
You'll find that you are as yet unable to force it open Turn left Walk to the opposite wall and look down in the dark open cupboard to pick up thePIPE CLEANER Look up and click on any one of the displayed pipes to hear that Sherlock and Lord Montcalfe have a love of ornate pipes in common Nothing else to do here Look up and click on the picture of Lord Montcafe Sherlock muses that it is strange that none of his archeological finds can be viewed down on the ground floor When you back out of the picture look at the large wall framed family tree which it appears Lord Montcalfe has vandalized with some particularly virulent comments Take particular note of Sherlock's remarks about Jonathan Parkey quot thief murderer
quot Swing around toward the entry door
Look at the pictures on the wall beside the door of Montcalfe in Egypt Leave the room Turn right and go forward once
Turn right and enter THE UPSTAIRS STUDY Turn left immediately Look down and pick up theFAKE REGISTERfrom the floor near the fallen book
Look at it to begin considering that there may have been some illegal manipulation of the archeological inventory Montcalfe collected
You think
Pan up and left to check out a locked panel No luck opening it for the time being Continue right to the picture over the fireplace You will see a forward hand cursor but no action is yet available with your current inventory You'll be back Examine the fire in the fireplace That's strange A cheery newly made fire in a deserted mansion
Continue around the room and click on the bay window to see a mysterious cutscene
Now who might that be sulking across the roof tops Examine the spy glass on the tripod Turn around to the desk and pick up and read the resignation letter from Edward the butler The letter announces the resignations of the entire mansion staff but does not provide a reason Walk to the wall bookcase next to the desk and see the other side of the little door you may have come across and couldn't open from the library gallery
Don't click on it unless you want to reenter the library and make you way around to where you are standing now
You can't get back into the upper study from the gallery side
As you go around the room and back to the door note that the chalk board left of the door has been erased Perhaps some formula or plan that Montcalfe wished to keep secret Or maybe the lurker on the roof tiles had something to do with this
Clearly someone has been in the study and most recently
Leave the room
Turn left and go forward once Turn right and reenter the parlor room where you found the pipe cleaner Go right to the lavender draped doorway
Use the fake register at the bottom of the door
THE BATHROOM Leave the room and go down the hall to enter the far door on the right Its the bathroom Pick up theBAR OF SOAPfrom the sink Before you leave check out the bathtub
Hmmm the water is still warm Who just bathed And who would be fool enough to leave the water in the tub
Unless of course you interrupted the ritual before the bather had a chance to erase the evidence Creepy business in any case Pull the plug and watch the water drain out of the tub Click on the bottom of the tub there's a residue of sand there Let's see sand here and sand in the mummy case The mummy had trouble resting in peace because he had sand in his drawers You think Enough conjecture leave the room and go back to the parlor Go to the lavender draped door and use the bar of soap on the lock put the fake register back under the door if its not still there
Use the pipe cleaner on the lock
Voila A cut scene reveals the trick to getting anotherKEY Use the key to open the door and enter Montcalfe's bedroom
The Egyptian decorative theme is everywhere
THE BEDROOM Walk to the left around the bedroom Find Montcalfe's pith helmet on a side table Go forward to view the bedside table with puzzle piece obviously missing from the parquet arrangement at the top The drawer is locked It doesn't take much to figure out that you'll need to solve the puzzle before you can open the drawer
Continue around the bed and walk up the along the opposite wall to the wardrobe in the corner Open the right side door Click on the shirt to find some powder that might be useful as an aging agent in designing a disguise
But who would be disguising themselves There's surely no indication that any of the mansion museum's sometime occupants ever performed in the theater
Exit the close up and go left to leave the room by the side door which takes you back to the hallway We need to find those puzzle pieces so we can open that nightstand drawer in Montcalfe's bedroom
Go down the hall toward the statue one time Stop and look down and to the right across from the study door You should see a fork sticking out from the edge of the carpet runner
Pick up thatFORK
Go back into the study and use the fork on the picture over the fireplace Sherlock will make a comment about a crack in the painting and you'll see a dark hole low in the center of the painting Use the fork in close up from your inventory to find the hole and pry the painting open revealing a hidden compartment
There are a lot of hidden panels rooms compartments in the the museum as you are discovering Find theREAL REGISTERof Montcalfe's Egyptian collection If you take the time to compare the quot real quot with the quot fake quot you will find some captivating discrepancies you might wish to mull over Pick up the CANE from the compartment
Go back to the parlor left down the hall and use the can on the lion trophy over the fireplace There's a pink wrappedPACKAGEhidden there for Elisabeth Click on it to separate it in inventory and to displayFOUR WOODEN PIECES Well no problem figuring out where those belong right When you exit the close up cross the room to the lavender draped doorway and reenter Montcalfe's bedroom Turn around
Go over to the nightstand on the left side of the bed Place the wooden pieces in their appropriate positions and open the nightstand drawer
I'll bet you thought there'd be another key in there Nope not this time
Its an encrypted document of some kind an eye a female figure with an ankh a cheetah a male figure with a staff Look in the drawer again and find a letter to Montcalfe from Dr Bigoudin advising him about the content of a scroll found near Momphis XI's sarcophagus A curse
What would a mummy story be without a curse Be sure to click on the arrows to see the note on the reverse side
Cross to the center of the room and look up at the fan You should get a magnifying glass cursor here if you are standing in the right spot
If not circle the fan until you see a small white button above the fan blades on the shaft Click on it to hear Sherlock express the need for quot something long quot You don't have the cane anymore but what you need is right here in this room Remember the document you just found in the drawer
Turn around and go to the mural on the wall above the table where you found Montcalfe's pith helmet Look familiar Click on the subjects in the mural as depicted in the document eye female with ankh cheetah male with staff
Take the GOLD AND GREEN SCEPTER Also that breaking glass noise you heard when you turned on the overhead fan might be worth investigating Go over to the right corner of the room and find a smashed urn Pick up aGOLDEN SCARABbeetle from the floor Leave the room by the double side door and go right forward and then left down the hall and back to the messy study
THE UPSTAIRS STUDY AGAIN Remember that panel on the top of the desk with the white chalky rings on it You may or may not have checked it out earlier Its on the left side of the desk as you walk in the study door Click to go over there and then click on the panel to reveal a hidden mechanism You quot need something to open it quot Use the golden scarab beetle from the bedroom on the bottom left wheel to turn them both
Then click on the t bar handle to move the panel aside Inside this compartment find a note from the quot Dawn of the Gods quot association regarding the funding of Montcalfe's Egypt expedition Find a second note proclaiming that Montcalfe had kept some items he was supposed to turn over to the association
Uh oh deviousness is apparently possible on Montcalfe's part
Did he steal some of the mummy's treasures Might that account for the possible curse and the mummy's apparent refusal to rest in peace Click on the last item in the compartment to learn that the clever Sherlock wants nothing to do with a weapon with which he is not familiar
Turn around and walk over to the hall door
Look at the little cupboard on the wall to the right Remember you couldn't do anything tangible with this apparatus earlier but this time you can click on it to discover oh gad a dreaded slider puzzle
Solve the slider Yes I mean on your own
Its not hard at all maybe five minutes and I'm no genius
Its takes less time to solve than it would be worth it to me to lay out all the steps here which I started to do and almost immediately abandoned When you've solved the slider you'll find anotherKEY
Take the key back to the parlor where the lion head is and use the key on the large cabinet standing left of the fireplace in the corner of the room Remove the fakeSCEPTERfrom the cabinet
Return to the hallway and turn slowly to rest your eyes on the quot fake statue quot at the end of the hallway
You've got a couple of scepters now in your inventory that might look quite charming as an addition to that statue
Use them both now
LEVEL Wow I know you were really glad to put that last level behind you On we go
THE WINE CELLAR Sherlock finds himself at the bottom of a long stairwell in a small dark wine cellar With your back to the door go left along the wall to the stoned in doorway at the end of the room Turn left to the littered table top and remove the box ofMATCHESfrom the upper left corner Examine the remnants on the dinner plate to hear Sherlock exclaim quot Someone had dinner here a few hours ago quot Take theWATER FLASKto the right of the dinner plate Swing to the left and pick up the sleeping cot to see a trap door beneath it Sherlock remarks quot Someone has been sleeping here quot Maybe the mummy Naw Click on the trap door
No surprise you'll need something to open it
Turn to your left and go along between the wine casks to the opposite wall Look down left and pick up aHAMMER Turn around and walk down the wall to the wine storage racks Turn left and remove aBOTTLE OF LIQUEURand a hiddenGIN BOTTLE Click on the now empty shelf to hear the quot bottom seems to be made to fit circular objects quot Like the bottom of a wine bottle maybe well duh But wait this will mean more to you later
Turn right and go forward twice more Turn around
Find theBOTTLE OF BORDEAUXon the top right shelf Scan the additional wine shelves on the end wall to find aBOTTLE OF TOURAINEin the left corner five shelves up Also find a BOTTLE OF BOURGOGNEin the middle four shelves up Continue forward and pick up aBOTTLE OF SPAIN WINEfrom the end stack of shelving second shelf up Pick up aSTICKfrom the shelf next to it on the left
Return to the cot and lift it again against the wall
Use your hammer to break open the lid and extract a small AnubisSTATUE Was this statue the one stolen from the ambassador as chronicled in the newspaper article Turn around and facing the stoned up doorway pan down to pick up a secondSTICK
Turn around and go back to the rear wall
Turn left and go forward once
Look down at the floor wine rack and find anEMPTY BOTTLE
Go to stand at the left end of the floor rack where you can see down through the center of it Pick up aRAG Go to the other end repeat the process and pick up a secondRAG Let's just do a quick inventory check here before proceeding piece of bandage ribbon Elisabeth I found no use for either of the above articles during the game
water flask box of matches hammer bottle of liqueur gin bottle bottle of Bourgogne bottle of Bordeaux bottle of Spain wine empty bottle bottle of Touraine small Anubis statue two sticks two rags Okay ready to go on
Combine each of the two rags with a stick in your inventory screen to make aTORCH Use the gin bottle on the rag tips of each torch Use the matches on one torch
It will light
If you need the other torch later you will be able to use it then
Take the bottle of Bordeaux from your inventory and place it in the now empty shelf on the end of the side rack of wine shelves where you found the liqueur and the gin bottle Place the bottle of Bourgogne next to the bottle of Bordeaux Place the bottle of Touraine next to the bottle of Bourgogne Place the bottle of Spain wine next to the bottle of Touraine Place the bottle of liqueur in the last open position to reveal a descending shelf and an ascending slider puzzle
Oh no Not again Exit the puzzle immediately andsave your game this slider is timed
But don't panic you'll have plenty of time
Again this quot five minute quot slider is quite easily solved so the solution is not published here and the timer in the sequence extends for a considerable period
The slider puzzle is only the first in a series of prolonged conundrums When you have solved the slider the puzzle will shift away revealing a large silver button
Push it

Whew you didn't get blown up yet
THE STORAGE ROOM Go back to the storage room you opened a few minutes earlier and go to the back of the room where you can see a pinpoint of light
Pick up theOIL FLASK In the back left corner of the room on a bottom shelf you will find a small whiteBOTTLE OF OIL In inventory combine it with the oil flask There are five standing urns on the stone floor of this room
If you click on one you'll hear a message from Sherlock about making a mistake and needing quot to see from the beginning quot There's obviously a sequence required here Each of the standing urns has sound effect built in and a symbol at the bottom to help guide you
Referring you back to your notes find the first urn bearing a volute a spiral design which stands forair
Put the empty bottle in that urn
find the urn marked with a triangle which stands forearth Put the pouch of sand inside
find the urn inscribed with afire symbol and put the matches in that one

You should hear something happening over near the entry door when you have correctly solved this puzzle Go back to the left side of the door to find a new timed puzzle has appeared on the wall Save your game before you click on the puzzle
Its a riddle quot Five fingers in one hand One is cut but still present The last will be the first quot See your letters inventory and find the torn out page titled quot Introduction to India quot The answer to the riddle is there in the hierarchy defined for the Indian cast system B rahman K satriya V aisya S udra Remember the phrase from the riddle The last will be the first Reverse the order of the other three name to S V K and then attempt to place the last letter B in the remaining position on the puzzle board Before you can pick up and place the B however you will see a cut scene of one of the floor urns moving aside Turn right and return to the back left corner of the room to the urn located there Look down and pick up a third AnubisSTATUEfrom the recess in the floor
Sherlock remarks that maybe you will find more statues Remember that there are five of these hidden about the mansion museum
Look in your inventory to see that you still have the Brahman symbol from the wall puzzle Leave the storage room Go straight across the lab to the opposite door previously locked Open it to hear Sherlock comment that he is close to solving the mystery THE ROTATING ROOM Practice moving about the room with your cursor In order to accomplish this and to reach the statues you'll generally need to go forward to the center and then turn in the direction you wish to go
You want to reach all four statues
That's the bottom line When you have done this you will hear a click that indicates the opening of a panel in the floor over near the door where you came in
Pick up a fourth Anubis statue in the niche you will see there
Be sure to check out the riddle on the door to the right and rear of the room
Read the riddle in close up
Note While you are moving around the room you may notice chains on the left wall and a large metal ring in the center of the ceiling
Don't worry about it now but its an intriguing arrangement right
Leave the rotating room and go back across the lab to the storage room Use the quot B quot Brahman seal from your inventory on the center urn standing on the floor The seal will disappear into the urn and Sherlock will comment that Brahman may be the key to the mystery Brahman means quot truth quot Go back to the rotating room Just inside the door turn and click toward the center of the room
Turn and click forward to the center of the room three more times total Next click between the two appropriate statues while havingthe far door which you wish to open behind you You will then be able to access the far door and in close up read the sign Its better than God
Its worse than the devil Poor get plenty Rich people need it If you eat it you die

You've already sequestered the Brahman seal so back out of the close up and click on the door latch to open it
THE TREASURE ROOM ANTECHAMBER Save your game
Off to your right you'll find a large half cask filled with water And to the left of it a crude scale that looks like a black stool Click on it to hear Sherlock proclaim that its a quot balance quot the charter here is to put four liters of water on that scale
Water Puzzle Solution Take the little bucket Fill it with water
Pour it in the big bucket Click on the vials at the left side of your screen to put the little bucket down You should now have liter of water in the small vial bucket and liters in the big vial bucket Pick up the big bucket and dump its contents on the floor dark spot between the half cask and the scale Put the big bucket down Pick up the small bucket and dump the liter into the big bucket watch the vials Then fill the little bucket once and put it in the big bucket You should have exactly liters Success you clever sleuth Put the little bucket down
Pick up the big bucket and put it on the scale In a cutscene a Chess board will immerge from an alcove in the center of the dirt floor
Oh joy A dreaded Chess puzzle This one is no biggie Sherlock
Honest Just place the four Anubis statues from your inventory on the four corners of the Chess board In a cutscene a rectangle of stone a pedestal will rise from the center of the Chess board In the cutscene Jonathan Parkey Montcalfe's claimed enemy will come through the door with the missing fifth statue in one hand and a very large gun in the other He intends to show the way to the Treasure Room the inner sanctuary Ah but our old friend Mr Mummy has a big surprise for Jonathan
You see the mummy pull a lever in a cutscene and as Parkey attempts to open the entrance to the treasure room he is blown to pieces through a mysterious orifice that appears in the door
LEVEL THE DEMOLISHED TREASURE ROOM ANTECHAMBER You might want to save your game here as you are about to embark on another timed sequence The Scorpion Puzzle
Swing around and pick up both buckets over near the half cask of water

Look down to see a busy scorpion

Quickly take a bucket from your inventory and cover the scorpion

Move to the door

Turn around and click behind the Chess puzzle what's left of it

Look down when you arrive there and put the second bucket on the new scorpion

Pick up theWOODEN PLANK

Look down and pick up Parkey'sBAGwith the fifth Anubis statue safely tucked inside
Go back through the door to the destroyed rotating room You probably observed Parkey's dismembered body on the floor near the door but don't take the time away from solving the puzzle and getting out of there
Note If you have trouble solving the scorpion puzzle try reversing the order of the buckets you use
Use the big one on the first scorpion and the little one on the second or vice versa
Look out as you enter the rotating room here
You just might take a nasty fall Turn right and look down
Use the wooden plank to create a thin bridge to the corner statue Go to the statue and pick up the MIDDLE GEAR WHEELat the statue's feet Turn left and take theCHAIN Go back to your starting position in front of the door you came in through and walk out to the center of the axle of the wheel mechanism that turned the rotating room Remember that interesting ring in the ceiling Use the chain on it now Pan down and left to see a niche in the wall beside the exit door Click on it to see a cutscene where Sherlock swings his merry way through the niche and into the now destroyed wine cellar Sterling move Sherlock
THE DESTROYED WINE CELLAR Go forward once
Turn around and look for the grasping hand on one of the wine casks Click on it GUN POWDER rather than the anticipated wine flows from the cask

But there's always a solution coming right up if you wish to read on The Stone Door Puzzle Solution
Press the first stone on the bottom on the right side
Starting with the next stone up count and click on the third stone

It seems you now quot can go through the door quot THE DEVASTATED RECEPTION HALL Wow
Was that an explosion or what
The sad results of the blast seem to be evident everywhere Its even still smokin' here in the reception hall You can take your time if you enjoy picking through debris but I'd suggest making a bee line for the area beside the left side staircase straight ahead You'll find a note in the lounge area there that encourages you to go upstairs
That is if you aren't afraid of the lurking mummy On the coffee table you'll discover someone the mummy of Montcalfe
was writing a note and its been partially burned
To the left of the lounge area in the corner there's a mirrored cabinet If you click on the mirror Sherlock will remark that there's something behind it Also you need quot something thin quot Store that in your memory banks for a moment and move on to the other side of the hall use your lantern on the remaining lighted candle on the chandelier and place theLIGHTED LANTERNin your inventory
Look down just in front of the stairs to see more sand and some gray hair More mummy discards no doubt Go up the stairs to the first landing Look on the next up riser and find aHAIR PIN Sherlock will comment something to the effect that quot this woman's trinket quot wasn't there the first time he went up the stairs
Elisabeth's trinket perhaps Something more to mull over concerning the probability of an unseen populous roaming about the mansion
Why would Elisabeth be in the mansion without announcing herself
Ahem oh well time to press on Sherlock
Turn around and go back down to the mirrored cabinet in the corner Use the hair pin you'll find an quot absolutely dreadful document quot DIRTY PAPER Go back over to the chandelier and hold the dirty paper up in front of the burning candle to see a map or chart

The question is where would these tiles or strings of tiles be placed along that particular line
Using the horizontal and vertical numbers you can logically derive the arrangement of the darker tiles and the background tiles secondarily You might want to copy your particular grid yes I'm sorry but the picture changes from game to game to paper and work it out off line without running out of time

Position the arrowhead at the open spot at bottom
Move the arrowhead using left click on the place you want it to go
Click on next ring when the rotating bar just passed
Time each click on the next subsequent rings when the rotating bars are far from where you click

If Mr Thomas Robinson was arrested by Lestrade as a swindler get a message from Mycroft
Sherlock dear brother you have made the most terrible mistake once again
Are you quite aware of who exactly Mr Thomas Robinson is
Well I shall tell you not only is he a well known inventor and a valued member of society but he is also an official government negotiator for technical development
And now that he is in prison we shall have to find another inventor
Take a look at what you have done
I believe that you are blinded by so called 'justice' above all things
Yours Mycroft
If Mr Thomas Robinson was arrested by Mycroft as a swindler see a newspaper account
The technical progress of the British Empire is now an example to the international community
Three days ago our own famous inventor Mr Thomas Robinson presented a prototype of his most recent invention the 'Autonomous Electricity Generator'
It caused an incredible furore
It is another confirmation of the fact that our Empire has produced so very many eminent people
In other news a train has mysteriously disappeared en route to Evesham railway station
If the Mexicans are arrested for the murder of the Chileans and the case was given to Mycroft see a newspaper report The power of the Empire is growing stronger day by day
As of yesterday the Mexican consortium Caracal began serving the cause of the British Empire
This arrangement is undeniably profitable for London and England overall and is a great achievement for our exceptional diplomatic and political community
In other news a train has mysteriously disappeared en route to Evesham railway station
If the Mexicans are arrested for the murder of the Chileans and the case was given to Lestrade get a message from Mycroft
Sherlock dear brother you have made the most terrible mistake once again
Are you quite aware of the fact that the Empire is at the brink of international conflict
How could you pass this incredibly sensitive case to those feather brained Scotland Yard Bobbies
Very well yes they caught the criminals but have you not read the newspapers
The great fuss that has risen around it
They are generalising all Mexicans
And as you may know the Empire has arrangements with a great many varied and loyal Mexican enterprises
You should think about that
Yours Mycroft

If Lady Brackenstall is absolved get a letter from Lady Brakenstall Dear Mr Holmes I have finally found the courage to write you a letter
I can scarcely find the words to express my gratitude for your kindness
On that terrible day I believed my life to be ruined ndash but at the same time I felt released
Released from the humiliation and the violence from the constraints that were killing me
And soon I shall marry a man who loves me dearly although his identity I wish to keep a secret
None of this could have happened without you Mr Holmes
Yours sincerely Mary Brackenstall
If Captain Crocker is condemned get a letter from Inspector Lestrade
Mr Holmes I am writing to inform you that the affair at the Abbey Grange which took place almost half a year ago now still resonates deeply in high society and remains a subject of much gossip
This case's romantic background has attracted many suitors who show willing to shelter and take pity on Lady Brackenstall
But to this date she still serves her sentence with her maid Theresa and has rejected all offers of help
To be truthful I suspect that the true motivation of these suitors may well be related to Sir Eustace's title and money
What do you think Mr Holmes
Sincerely yours Inspector Lestrade
If Lady Brackenstall is condemned read the newspaper A shocking affair at the Abbey Grange that took place on November th is still a subject of interest and rumour
Yesterday a man of wealth by the name of Sir Joseph Cook officially expressed his willing to assist in shortening the sentence of Lady Brackenstall and her maid in exchange for the Lady's hand and heart
He does not seem perturbed by her background and only takes pity on her circumstance
High society is greatly concerned regarding Sir Joseph's decision
In fact even should the Lady accept the marriage may not be permitted to go ahead

Holmes No matter how famous a detective you may be I must warn you you have made a mistake in arresting my only and beloved son Albert
And for what
For the murder of my husband
Everyone knows that he died of a heart attack
What is this fairy tale you have invented of a poisonous plant
Are you insane
You have no idea of my influence
I will crush you
Mrs Barbara Dunne
If Albert Dunne is absolved get a letter from Miss White Dear Mr Holmes I am writing to you in admiration of your deductive talents You quite brilliantly uncovered the truth behind the terrible murder that took place here at Kew Gardens
I cannot believe that it was Mr Hamish hellip it is so terrible to realise we were working with a murderer
Nevertheless despite how sinister this place has become we are managing it together with Albert and I am now able to continue my studies
Thank you so much for your remarkable work
Yours sincerely Margaret White
If Margaret White is absolved get a letter from Albert Dunne Dear Mr Holmes I am writing to express my appreciation for your striking at the truth of this horrible case
At first I could not even imagine how Miss Margaret White such an exceptional and beautiful woman could plan and commit such a dreadful murder with that fellow Hamish
How angry I was
But when I attempted to put myself in her shoes I began to understand
As talented and beautiful a lady as Miss White was she evidently could not complete her studies without money ndash while my father was living his high life deficient in human sympathy
Thank you for your kindness towards her
She is no longer here and already I miss her
Yours sincerely Albert Dunne

Written by Sharon Fernandez s fernandez spu edu Last modified on This cannot be an exact walkthrough because the pots and lids are not always in the same place for each new game
The pairs of pots and lids that you must match seem to be the same for each game
So I will guide you to some places and help you avoid other places until you're ready to capture the Ixupi
Table of Contents General StrategiesDoing the Walkthrough in the book USA version only shame on Sierra Exploring the rest of the museumPuzzle hints and solutionsIxupi hiding placesPot and lid pairs and their locationsFlashback items and their locationTrivia questionsGENERAL STRATEGIES You can only have one item in your inventory at any time
When you match a pot and talisman then they become a single item
Take careful note of where every pot and talisman is found or placed
If you exchange a newly found item for one you were carrying or if you move things from a far away location to some place closer your notes will save you a lot of wandering around
You can usually tell if the Ixupi are nearby for they make a unique noise
If you turn away quickly you should be safe
Point system in general Solved puzzle ptsClues ptsReading plaques ptsInventory item ptsLoss of life essence ptsRecorded message for each room pts If you see any objects laying around examine them
Some are not essential to the game but are worth points
I have played the game twice and come up with a high score of points
Your score can be quite a bit more if you travel via the elevators which I avoided as much as possible
Use the tip of your mouse pointer not the lower fat part it took me awhile to realize this so I'm just passing it along
The USA version of the game apparently includes a thicker book than the international version and it contains a quot Walkthrough quot chapter
Never fear
I'll pass along the few answers it contains
Watch the opening movie of your friends locking you inside the museum grounds
This is your first flashback item
Now would be an excellent time to set the quot text on quot option
OUTSIDE THE MUSEUMTurn left and see the dragon gargolye
The chain's handle will open it and inside you find a letter
Read it
As the letter falls to the ground observe the number inside the dragon's mouth
Turn around and walk up the museum stairs until you will reach a locked door
The squawk box on the right side will play a recording that the museum is not open
Make note of the markings at the top of the door and its color
As you head back down find another set of markings and a different color to the right of the purple vase
You must then find another way in so follow the path toward the gazebo
Find a third set of markings behind the tall object
Go just beyond the arch then look back to see the fourth set of markings on the triangular stone
Turn back toward the arch
Find the markings on the bench
By the time you reach the gazebo you should have markings and colors
Walk to the very end of the path to see the submerged steps
Enter the gazebo and open the metal box and solve its puzzle
Exit the gazebo and cross on the raised steps
As you approach the Stonehenge replica find the last marking on the perimeter wall
Look down
Now use the markings and colors you've seen to solve this puzzle
Descend the spiral staircase
Open the door and find the light switch along the left side
Continue traveling downward either passageway gets you to the underground lake
Open the stone door
UNDERGROUND LAKEFind the corpse on your left
Take the book and read it
This now appears as flashback item
Get on the boat
Go to the rear turn left look down move the anchor pin down
Move to front of boat look down and move its anchor pin up
Now you can turn the crank several times to reach the other side
During the crossing the water spirit will appear and take some life essence
You cannot avoid this
When you've reached the other shore notice a pot straight ahead
Get off the boat and head right to find that pot
When you examine it Professor Windlenot's ghost will appear and warn you
This becomes flashback item
Examine the markings on the pot for later identification
Walk down the tunnel and find the elevator
Match the design on the doors with the nearby box diagonal pattern
Enter the elevator and travel up to the museum office
MUSEUM OFFICEExplore the office thoroughly but avoid the fireplace
Items you should find the map on the wall a newspaper in the coat pocket a letter on the floor the elevator behind the tapestry a door into a workshop a message on the tape recorder on the desk and a letter in the desk
The scrapbook on the desk will become flashback item
Be sure you find the lid for the ash ixupi in the lower right hand drawer
LIBRARYThe library is the next room to explore
Take the door to the left of the fireplace
Walk a little forward and turn left
The door you see is to the library
Enter and concentrate your search to the right of the candelabra but beware the wax Ixupi might be there
You should find a total of books in this bookcase flashback items and
If you are having trouble start with the only book that is leaning this is quot the Black Book quot
Now the next one is two to the right and orangish in color
Then the whitish one another four books from the last one
The last one is one shelf lower and is purple in color
Further exploration should quickly reveal another passage but leave that for later
Find the ladder in front of another bookcase and check it out later
Leave the library through its front door stay to the right of the display case in the center of the room and enter the double doors between the two pillars
If you reached the stairs you've gone to far
STRANGE BEASTSEnter the Strange Beasts room head toward the far left corner and find another double door green with a serpentine pattern
Enter the Amazing Plants room and turn left forward then left again
You will find the bottom to match the lid you found in the office
If you have the lid then the two pieces will magically join otherwise take the pot and go back to the office and join the two items
Now you can capture your first Ixupi if it's still in the fireplace ashes
Probably the most useful item to locate are some blueprints
They are in the Mysteries of the Deep room
If you are in the office head back to the Strange Beasts room otherwise leave the Amazing Plants room head left around the eagle nest
MYSTERIES OF THE DEEPFind another set of double doors in the Strange Beasts room
Go through the doors take note of the map on the floor and examine the Poseidon Neptune display
Here is the Globe puzzle
Solve it and you will have an inventory item and a very useful set of museum blueprints as flashback item
Go a little further and find the Sirens Organ puzzle at the far end right corner
Solve this one and a door opens at the Colossus of Rhodes exhibit just to the right of the organ
Enter the new passage and find the Movable Wall puzzle
No clue for this one yet so we'll return later
As you come back out of the passage notice the splotch of yellow straight ahead
We'll check it out in a minute
Watch for the sand earth Ixupi who sometimes occupies the building display on your left
If you go back toward the globe then just a bit beyond turn right forward right again and go along the wall
At the far end are some yellow crystals which the Ixupi might be occupying
MAIN ENTRY HALLLeave the Mysteries of the Deep Room go back to the Main Entry Hall and explore some more
You should find the staircase going to the second floor a stone water fountain with a hidden spigot careful Ixupi maybe the doors behind the desk which match the locked doors on the outside of the museum two panels one to the right of the desk and one to the left of the fountain and a door that will lead into the Theatre
Look in the desk drawer for the museum brochure flashback item
You'll need this to find and set the skeleton dials throughout the museum
Also find an inventory item in one of the bird masks between the library and the office
THEATRETo get into the Theatre solve the Door Puzzle
Go around the right side of the theatre and climb the stage
You will find a note on the podium
Look toward the end of the stage area and notice it is empty
Retrace some of your steps and go up the left side of the stage
Travel the hallway noting the Door Puzzle at one corner and a secret passage at another corner
Enter the projection room and solve its puzzle
You now have flashback item and your clue to the Movable Wall puzzle
Go back to the stage area stand next to the podium and look again toward the end of the stage area
This time you should see an inventory item just behind the curtain
MAZELeave the theatre and re enter the Strange Beasts room
Go to the right of the giant eagle next set the skull dial blue then enter Mysteries of the Deep room and head toward the Subterranean World
Solve the Movable Wall puzzle
You will then travel down a couple halls and enter a room with three doorways

CHINESE CHECKER PUZZLE Base of Animal Sarcophagus in Funeral Rites Room Be sure to check out Erik Gos's solution at Spoiler's Center web site Strategy You need the last ball to end up in the center square
To get there it must have jumped over another ball
There was really no place it could come from so it has to be in its place at the start of the game
You can take any of the balls that are quot two away quot from the center position and use that as your quot last quot ball
Now let's think about the other moves
If we can get a series of free occupied free occupied etc spots then the quot next to last quot ball can do a lot of jumping over other balls and make them disappear
Its final resting place needs to be between the quot last quot ball and the center spot
If my picture isn't too crude then the middle section of the puzzle would look something like
O

O O O

O If you take the 'O' in row three column and make it jump clockwise or counter clockwise around the other balls it ends up where it started and is in prime position for the last ball to jump it and land in the center I actually worked the puzzle until I arrived at the above diagram but I didn't record all the moves so I cannot tell you how to get there
But there are other possible solutions A solution My method of identifying each ball to move will be based on a row column reference
If you look at the playing board there are rows and columns
Not every row column combination is possible such as or even
Thus the center position our desired ending position is designated
As for the direction to jump I'll simply use L left R right D down and U up Begin U R D U L L R L D U D U

DOOR PUZZLE in Puzzle Room Thanks to Mark Sutton for the following strategy
His last known e mails are Mark Sutton unc edu and msouth email unc edu if you want to drop him a line Solution The puzzle has seven pictures to go in five slots
To represent them use the letters A through G In other words the first symbol on the left equals the top slot on the game
I'll be positioning them left to right instead of top to bottom First keep all the initial symbols and hit the score button AAAAA If you get a zero you're in luck
That means that none of the first symbols exist in the final answer
Advance all of them to the next symbol and click the score again
If you get another zero repeat
Any score you get should be a multiple of ten such as BBBBB This means you have one of the symbols right
So change all the symbols but one and get the score CCCCB This lets you know that the puzzle has one B and two C's and one of the symbols is in the right position
It's not necessarily the B the score above lets you know there was a B in one position
Since all the positions had B's in them you can't be sure You want to get a score that adds up to five such as or
That means you have all the right symbols but some or all are in the wrong positions
Keep repositioning what you have
From this point on there is no magic formula and you might frequently run out of room before solving the puzzle
It just takes persistance

This Kiva is entered by use of a Blue Door that is only opened by clicking on the panel ofpetrogliph pictures and touching the Blue Skull
When placing your Bahos sticks in the Altar it is a good idea to keep you eye on the cursor
Watching carefully when it changesto green as some of the holes for placing these sticks are kind of ambiguous The petrogliphs correspond to each Bahos and the picture that was present when you picked up the Bahos
When you enterthe canyon with the Stick in hand you must find the Petrogliph Puzzle and solve the placing of the pieces to be able to thenplace it at the Kiva Altar

You may use this walkthrough parts of it but give usfull credit where it is due Updates If you're having trouble looking for the winding staircase here is picture of it Image by MysticWar Resort some sections Add new tips for fighting bosses Correction on Thaddeus' TowerGeneral TipsFor fast switching hit to highlight characters always highlights David and highlight whoever you choosed as your nd and rd character
highlights all of them your active character is the last you choosed To have your men be better at fighting themselves highlight them all then ctrl click their target
This way they won't be standing still and vuln
to attack
NOTE doing this method will cause anyone with a projectile weapon to fire it instead of moving in and attacking
This is good if you want backup
Your non active characters will continue to attack what they've been told to until you change their target or their target dies For fast switching of weapons use
last sword used last orb magical weapon used last projectile weapon used last shield used Using this method you can have someone versatile such as David have both a spell and a weapon at the same time
I E
switch from his weapons to the ice orb walk into your next room
Have him use the attack from far away and then quickly hit for close range combat
This works good with Sekune use for close range and for long range Special AttacksUnlike most items special attacks are NOT shared between characters 'mana wise' at least
When you pick up a special move each character has access to it and each character can use it at the same time
Which means if you have the falcon spell and your up against a boss you can make sure each character is using it as his or her special move and as soon as you use it you can switch characters and use theirs
Also specials move regenerate on their own like magic weapons
You can use ALL your special moves before any of them regenerate
To use a special move hold CTRL then the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON and do not move the mouse in any direction
In about a second it will perform the special move
You can also perform Special Attacks with your magical orbs
Select one of the magical orbs and press A
This attack is very powerful and has a large ground coverage however it also uses a lot more mana that a regular magic attack
Your character will perform different attack base on the level of the magic One last thingI aWG had some trouble with the game by simply MISSING items that I should have picked up but couldn't see either due to someone stepping on it or just having the item fall behind another structure
To make sure you have picked up everything vital after a fight click and drag the right mouse button over the battle area and your active character will run and pick up all the items within the highlight
StartThis walkthrough starts at the point where you meet the rebels at the camp
Talk to the people on the far left they'll teach you a special move
Now pickup the torch by the fire Quest for the Telescope
Head toward the caves down and right from the camp
Use the torch in your backpack before entering
You'll fight your way until the gold imp asks for help
Spare his life and he'll lead you to a treasure where you will resupply however he will drink a potion and you will have to fight him
If you use the web of death on him then continue to hit him you'll get bonus points of damage
Keep close to him
Keep fighting until you reach another save point then take out the ice wand cuz its the best against the boss
When fighting the boss run behind the rock that is split in half
Use the backwards spinning attack to kill the people behind you use the ice wand to shoot through the rocks and kill the boss
Your safe from his attack Mission for RainNext is your mission in Rain
Refer to your tips on how to control multiple people
Keep exploring the level until you find a teddy bear from an old lady Oracle Speaks st orbAfter your mission in rain you will be sent to the oracle
There you will learn about Silver's plans You will receive a map a horn and a potion if you talk to the scientist there
After you've saved hit 'm' to go to map then go to Othias' tower where you will receive your first orb a sword a special move and a silver key used to open the ice land Ice Orb nd orbAfter you've completed the first orb you should go to the 'oracle' and then exit downwards
This will bring you to the iceland
My combination for starting was Sekune with a good sword and David with the fire orb
Every arch in the bridge has an ice dragon underneath it
David can take out each with hit since fire does extra damage to ice creatures
After the st screen David should be low on mana so switch him to a sword since the next screen will have not many ice enemies
Then before you enter the cave switch him back to the orb after the first cave scene back to the sword and keep it that way until your about to open the door to the boss Secrets for killing the boss Sekune will most likely die first thing
Stay away from the boss cuz he has massive close range damage
Everytime you kill one of his guards you'll get a recharge orb
Use David's specials on the guards then recharge and use the fire on the boss
You may need to resup with food quickly during your battle Quest for the rd orb healing orb Hit M and go to the library entrance just to talk and learn some info
Now that you have decent enough weapons go to David's house use the map
Keep going right until you reach rueben's house
Then go back and go up where you saw your first welcoming party past David's house
You'll meet vivian
Now run across the log and go left
The mayor's friends will attack you then flee leaving you the key to Rain
Now arm David with the ice orb and go left
You'll fight little fire demons and since you have David with ice you'll do extra damage and they'll leave magic orbs for resupplying
After you've beat them make sure David still has on his ice orb and is fully resupplied
Now continue on to fight the boss
The trick to fighting this boss is quot look out for quot
Forget your friends they get full health after you beat the boss anyways
The fire demon will come out from one of the holes
Use the rock in the center as your shield always staying on the opposite side of it as the fire demon
Keep shooting the ice orb at the boss while he attacks your friends
When you run out of mana take out your ice wand and shoot his little guard he'll leave a resupply orb then continue with the ice orb
This boss is probably the easiest boss in the game
The next screen is a fire tree you can't 'open it' but it will be used to mark a spot on the map at this point Now that you've done the above go to rain and at the first intersection head upwards
You'll come across the place to unlock the key
At the tavern you will meet Jug who is an awesome teammate the strongest in the game
Trade him in for Sekune since she's only good for long range attacks
Talk to everyone and buy everything
After your done hit M and go to Othias' tower just to save a bit of time At Othias' tower exit right then exit down left left down until you reach the door with the bell use the code the old man told you in the tavern ring it times pause twice pause once
Go in exit to the LOWER left buy some silver exit DOWNWARD to go back then exit to the UPPER left this ensures your teammates will be far from the werewolf so each will have their turn if you fail
For the werewolf use an AXE and sideswipe all the time
You'll see the magic damage cuz you have silver with you
You may shorten the time it takes to beat him by using the CLEVER special move on him
Continue past the werewolf you'll see the boatman
You should have all you need to sail to the spires Boss Tips To beat the dragon you hafta use projectiles
I suggest ice orb because it has good aim and does the most damage
The trick to beating this boss is to put your teammates into the back where there's a little dip
Now use David with the ice orb and run toward where the dragon is
As soon as you come near reaching him he will fly to the other side so as soon as you make it to his head start running in the other direction
Once you've made it directly under him by judging his flying to the other side you shoot his belly where it will do the magic damage signaling that you hit him properly
It doesn't matter if your teammates die because they get full resupply after you beat him Quest for the th orb lightning When you beat the healing dragon go downward then to the left if you haven't already
You'll be greeted by LOTS of enemies
When you defeat them all a chest will appear
In the chest is the necklace you will use to unlock the fire tree
So hit M and go to the Fire Tree
Once you unlock the fire tree spirk will tell you that the scientist wants to see you
All it means is that the scientist made some new potions When you enter the fire tree area exit lower RIGHT not left or you will face a boss you may not be up to facing at the moment You will eventually find Cagen
Trade him for vivienne because he is one of the best characters in the game
He's the nd best for magic and on top of it he's very agile As you fight your way through the monastary you will come to the point where you will meet the meditating monk
He will ask for a life question
When this happense hit M and go to the Library Entrance
You can get a life question from the scientist that asked you for one earlier
Then hit M and go back to the monastary
The monk will reward you with a potion that will transport you to a house
There you will find Rueben's key
Hit 'M' go to Rueben's house
You will find Chiaro
I don't recommend him
He's wise and has good magic but is not strong does not have good AC not good at range skill
So just send him to the camp
Upstairs you will find the orb Quest for the th orb Earth Magic Now that you have enough special moves
Go back to the fire tree
This time take a left
My setup was Cagen Lightning OrbJug Long Sword Scyth David Long Sword Scyth Have Cagen sit back and shoot while the big guys do the damage with the special moves
Defeating this boss gives you a bronze key and a lightning staff Now your ready to take on glass' palace
Hit 'm' go to the quot turret quot
Take the highest paths they will lead you to Glass' palace
When your in the palace you will eventually have a choice of taking a left or a right
Choose left
You will continue on and eventually face an ice dragon
You will get to save your game RIGHT before you fight Boss Tips Make sure you have LOTS of health potions handy
This boss is pretty tough
The hardest part about this boss is the timing
You have to hit him with the FIRE ORB as he's CHARGING and there are types of charging
One is when hes recharging his health
You will be able to tell this by the ice glows around him
When you shoot him while hes doing this he will be hurt and let a recharge orb drop
The nd type of recharging is when he will throw a level ice ball at you his belly will be exposed during this charge
As soon as you see him stand on his back legs you must throw the fireball for it to hit him properly
The boss stamps on the ground and makes isicles fall from the roof this is the hardest to dodge
However I have a technique that you may use to dodge the iceballs and the ice spray
Simply hide behind frozen Jug since he is big he will block the ice from hitting you
You will also be able to shoot from behind Jug Things you should know about the Throne Room The exit at the top left is where the Earth Magic orb is
You can save your game there
At the bottom RIGHT is another exit
You must go thru there and grab some items
From this room you will get the Barracks key and a Jewel key
Go back to the throne room and walk down the carpet into another room then take the right path
You will see a big hole in the center of the screen and a door north of it use the Jewel Key there
In that room you will find the blue key and the amulet of seeing
Go back to the front of the palace first room and you will find the blue door
Inside the blue door is the Summoning of Golem magical weapon and a war hammer for your use Quest for the th orb Acid Magic Go to the rebel camp and talk to everyone
Fat Bob will tell you a password that you will use on the tavern keeper hit 'M' and go to the tavern
He will let you into the sewers
Just before you enter someone will teach you how to use the 'falcon' special move
The best combo for this level is Cagen with EARTH MAGIC and Jug and David with swords
EARTH MAGIC does special damage on most creatures in this level
It will help you clear rooms fast and efficiently since earth magic does not take up a lot of mana
Be sure to let the water out before saving your game
If you did not let the water out and are asked to save go back and let the water out and THEN save which will save you the trouble of re letting the water out if you die
The wheel for the water is found by a winding staircase
The machine is found opposite of the boss' lair
When you defeat the boss he will give you the acid magic orb Boss Tips Use Cagen with earth magic and have your other two characters special move him to death Quest for the th orb Time Orb Go to Thaddeus' Tower and walk down one screen then enter a hole in the wall located at the upper right corner of the screen
When you enter the wall head east then head into the gate entrance on the next screen
You will come across Khan kill him and take his Bastard sword and Dragon shield
Continue on until you find a stairway and a very large door
Take the stairway up and you will encounter a purple imp
He will turn invisible and attack you
Attack him and you will receive ring of invisibility
Head back down and enter the large door that you saw earlier
You will come across Jeremiah an old man in a hanging cage
He will drop his key down to bottom you need to shoot the lever across the room with a projectile magic or weapon to lower the bridge
Kill the big lizard at the bottom and you will receive a gold key
Proceed down and you will find Duke in a cell
After you have defeated all the monsters Duke will talk to you
After talking to Duke head up and you will enter a room with a giant fan in the floor
Pull the lever next to toilet seat at the lower left of the screen to turn the fan into a stairway
When you come into a room with a big cage hanging in the center equip David with the best sword and shield head down the stairs and get ready to fight Fuge Tips for Khan Two falcon special moves executed with David and Jug will kill him Tips for Purple Imp Use the amulet of seeing to help you attack him Tips for Fuge When you first are able to attack Fuge will teleport to the lower right
When he does this use the ring of invisibility then hit him with your ice orb which should be level
Once you are out of mana kill him with ALL your special moves cycle thru them and use the charged ones
Drink strength and enchanted armor potions BEFORE fighting Fuge
Drink the health potion instead of eating the food when your health is low After defeating Fuge you will receive Fuge's swords and half moon key
Save here if you want then go into the room at the upper left corner of the screen
Kill the monsters and head down the stairs
Kill the guard in there and you will receive the cell key necessary to free Duke
After getting the key go into the room that the guard was standing a moment ago
You will meet Moss use the Teddy Bear and talk to him
Head back to the cell and free Duke
After you have had the conversation with Glass head back to the Rebel Camp
Talk to the old lady Edith and she will give you a ring of resist magic
Next head toward the Harbour in Verdante
Make sure you have at least of gold in order to board the boat to Deathgate
Fight your way through boneyard and you will come across the ghost of Ben's brother
After talking to Ben head toward the lower right corner of your screen
Head under the wooden wood you will meet the ghost of Professor O'Leary after you have killed all the creatures
He will give you the scroll of revelation needed to enter The Dig
After getting the scroll get out from that screen and take the other path below the wooden bridge
You will meet the ghost of Canitos he'll give you the stone key Now that you have all the necessary items to get the th orb use your map and go to the Airlock in Spires
Use your stone key and open the chest to get Lycanthrope
Lycanthrope allows you to morph into a werewolf for a limited period of time
Use your map and go to Library Entrance in Gno
Use your gold key at the big brown door
After getting the Hurricane SP and Golem II head back to the Rebel Camp
Upon entering Rebel Camp Ben will teach you the Berserker SP
Then walk through the narrow path north of the Rebel Camp
When you reach a fountain your character will use the scroll of revelation to reveal the hidden passage
Make your way through the forest and you will come across a chest in a camp site
The chest contains the Green Key and Time Orb Quest for the th orb Light Orb Continue moving further and you will fight a blue earth creature
He is not hard if you can freeze him with your level ice magic
After defeating him you will get an iron key
Use the iron key at the gate on top of the screen
Get the Bone Key inside the chest and head to the Sewers in Rain via your map
Upon entering the Sewers head right up the stairs up lower right then use the Green Key in the gate located at the bottom center of the screen
Get the Armageddon SP inside the chest and head back to Bone Yard via your map
Unlock the protected gate with the Bone Key and enter it
You will be teleported into a place with invisible floating cyclops
Use your amulet of seeing to see the cyclops
After killing them make your way down the path at the bottom center of your screen
Enter one of the opened doorways it doesn't matter which one
Kill the cyclops and step in the bursting wave on the ground then make your way to the right
The door will open when you've defeated the Lady of Light
Behind the door you will find the Light Orb located at the top right and the save point at the top left
Grab the Orb and head back to the Rebel Camp via your map
Buy any necessary items from the wizard at the oracle before going to the Rebel Camp
You won't be able to come back once you've entered the portal at Rebel Camp
Choose your party and step into the portal
You can no longer use the map once you are in Metalon Final Battles at MetalonAfter entering the portal make your way through Metalon there is only one exit in each screen so there is no confusion there
You will soon reach a screen with a bridge and a passage you can't get to at the right side
Go up the bridge and you will enter a room that has a red smoke pot top center of the screen Click on the pot and your character will drop something in there to get rid of the smoke
A portal will now appear enter it and make your way to the right
Continue down the path and you will come across a robot in a tube ignore it and go further down
Click on the pot and the wall will dump out red blood
Now go back to the portal and you will now face the robot you saw earlier in the tube
Kill the robot then save and enter the passage where he came from
Make your way through the mansion use the half moon key when you come across a room with glitters in front of it
Get the Granite Key inside the chest and use it on the door with glitters
After talking to Oberius make your way to the right
Once you're in a room with a round fence in the center press one of the buttons at the left side of the screen
Press the other button on the right side and kill the two cretures
A crystal will then rise from the center of the screen and the door will rise up
Three screens from here and you'll face your final battle with Silver you will also be able to save two screens from here Tips for the robot He is immune to magic and if you try and use magic on him he will gain hit points
I found what works best is have Cagen stay back and not attack while Jug uses a powerful weapon to swipe and David uses the Lycanthrope the Lycanthrope will do massive damage against the robot When fighting Silver let your two strongest characters attack the robot and let the one with the most magic point attack the hanging ball located at the center of the screen
Attack the ball first with fire magic after it has been destroyed use the ice then healing then lightning then earth then acid then time then finally the light magic
After Silver is finished you will face Apocalypse
It is wise to use your shield in combination with your sword when fighting Apocalypse on ground
My best strategy against Apocalypse is to hit him once with a thrust motion ctrl mouse motion up then block and when your falcon SP is fully charged use it on him
Repeat this until he starts to fly off the ground
At this point run away from his earthquake blast
While Apocalypse is flying and bombarding you with fireballs and other stuff run do not stand still for a second
Once he has landed on the ground continue the same shield and thrust attack
Once you have his blood down to zero he will fly to the center of the center
Go to the cliff under him and perform your falcon SP one last time
After he dies you and your party will run out of the mansion and on to a ship aWG's tips for Silver The trick to this boss is control over all of your characters
What you should do is select ONLY cagen ctrl click the magic ball
Then select a different character this way Cagen will continue to attack the ball even tho you do not tell him to
With your nd character use the special on the bot
If you land the special on the bot the bot will almost surely die
This gives you another seconds to switch orbs
You can resupply mana with the orbs the bots leave behind
Once you have used David's special switch to Jug and use his
Keep alternating which is your active character so you may use their specials most efficiently
The bots go down with falcon special move
Falcon seems to be the most effective
If you want EXTRA help have Jug use the Golem spell and David use Lycanthrope
The bots are immune to armageddon special move
Oh and a last note when you let Cagen continue his attack on the magic sphere the LIFE orb and the TIME orb will not make him auto attack
So for those orbs you have to make him attack manually aWG's tips for Apocalypse MysticWar's block and lunge strategy is what I used
However I have additional tips for dodging his projectiles
For his lightning run in a straight line from one side to the other in the middle vertical wise
If you reach the end of the screen wait till the one behind you explodes then run backwards
For the volcanoe attack it's a bit more complicated
Stand a few feet away from the errupting volcanoe
As soon as you hear the noise run straight and away
As soon as you see the first rock change your running path
It helps if your close to the two volcanoes near the middle vertical wise
Because those are the easiest to dodge using this method
When he's about to stamp just hold ctrl and quickly press the right mouse button several times
This will get you just out of the way of his attack while allowing you to strike him with a lunge when he comes back down
The last tip I have conflicts with MysticWar's
He says that you should use the falcon as your last attack on him since he stays far away and shoots fireballs
However my tip is whenever he shoots fireballs look towards his direction and block it with your shield hold ctrl and hold the right mouse button
It will deflect his shot back at him and hit him for 'magic' damage
This is how I beat him when he stays in the air for his last hit point Did I miss anything
Know some cool tricks

Game Boomers Game Cheats and Walkthroughs for Boomers and the rest of you guys
I love this game
However there are some pretty bad moments when I could have just taken a hammer and smashed the computer to pieces
But I eventually I finished it and boy was I satisfied
So here's help for some areas of the game where I got stuck and a lot of other people too Also look closely at the screenshots to see the exit cursor if youre stuck and need to find an exit point
To find Glass's Palace You have to go to south from the oracle and then west
Eventually you will find a tower like structure that needs to be opened with one of your keys
This was my first major stumbling block that had me going crazy just to find the path that led to the palace
How to Ring the Damn Bell
First remember the code that the old man taught you in the tavern
Ring it times in succession
Then pause for a second
Next ring it twice then pause again
Finally ring it once more and the gates will open
Okay the trick here is when after you ring the bell and start to pause look at David's and see whether he nods his head
If he nods then youre on the right track
If not then adjust your timing on the ringing part and you will succeed eventually
How to kill the Green Dragon If you don't have the lightning orb then you can't just hit it directly and damage it
At least that's what I got from other people
The way to kill it without using lightning is to wait for it to stop then shoot at it from underneath
You can usually get shots at it this way before it comes crashing down on you
The trick to get out of the way is to defend or backout ctrl right click
To find the Lighning Orb You have to talk to the wiseman in the monastery
The way to find him is through the left exit in the main building which I thought was extremely well hidden
Incidently this was my nd stumbling block that prevented me from finishing the game
To open the Sluice Gates There are a lot of people asking how to open the sewer gates and there are some that just can't open the gates just by ringing the bell
I managed to open them on my first try
To those that don't know how to open them you need to shoot at the bell with some sort of weapon eg slingshot magic etc
To those that just can't open the gates even after shooting them well here are my saved games
I've checked them out and they all work to open the gates
sav is the one where I haven't got the lightning orb and have not open the gates yet
Just go to the rebel camp and talk to Ben and Fat Bob then go to the tavern and talk to inkeeper then proceed down to the sewers and open the gates by shooting at it
sav is the one where I have done all of the above and have even opened the gates
That's all that I can do at the moment on this problem
Hope it helps
Without further ado sav zip sav zip To find the acid orb The acid orb can be found in the sewers
It is guarded by the Rat King or some other monster
Follow the screens below to get to him
To find the Enemy Barracks The enemy barracks can be only after you have drained away the flood to the sewers
Go back to the place where you saw the boatman
Then scroll the screen rightwards and you should come upon exits with one leading to the barracks
How to find the little boy that needs the teddy First you need to defeat Fuge
After deafeating him follow the screens below and you will get to him
Now equip the T Bear and he will take it from you
After giving him the T Bear then go back to the rebel camp to collect your reward which is quite useful by the way
Note that you do not need to complete this quest to win the game To defeat the final boss This is the toughest challenge yet
However I was to fed up at having to defeat the wizard time and time again just to set up another match with the end boss
So I've posted some of the battle tactics that should help you defeat him
Have fun and enjoy the ending
You need to use the falcon magic on it as it is going to land
This will do some major damage
Then hack'n'slash
As he flies away to shoot fireballs at you face him and hit defend ctrl rightclick
One of the fireballs will eventually be deflected and hit him for some damage
Repeat until it dies
I think that I have covered most of the problems that you will face in the game cept the bell not opening the sluice gates when you ring it
I have totally no clue as to why some of you can't open it sorry Any questions or comments please send e mail to me SBuddha rocketmail com Back toGameBoomersCheats Hints and Walkthroughs

After Graham leaves Valanice remembers what happens the night before The scene changes to the cave we saw in the beginning of the episode Valanice enters and sees Rosella magically bound to the wall by Shadrack He tells Valanice to open Pandora's Box
You are now playing as Valanice A box will pop up saying that the game will now create save points for you Click to close that window and use the hand icon on Pandora's Box
Choose Easy or Normal Mode for opening the box when prompted They are basically the same except in Normal Mode the swirling images you will be working with start fading in and out a little sooner

You will now begin an action sequence Follow the game's instructions for the first two steps Then you will be on your own
When Shadrack attacks dodge or use Wind or Water power to defend yourself when he raises his arms and creates lightning dodge to the right or left using the arrow icons on the amulet either side works
when he rolls a ball of lightning in his hands in front of him look at the green clouds and dodge on the opposite side of where they are in the sky
when he charges toward you in a swooping motion use the Water defence when he charges toward you in a swirling motion use the Wind defence
One of his attacks that I found particularly difficult was his rocking of the boat When Shadrack says quot Hold still Graham quot ready your cursor and quickly click the arrow on the amulet in the opposite direction the boat is rocking and to where graham slides The only attack I found that would work against him when it was Graham's turn to charge was the Earth attack Keep using this attack until the very end when Shadrack is almost defeated Then when he starts creating green swirling lights with his hand use the Fire attack against him
That's it you will have defeated him Shadrack says you are still strong and leaves Watch the final cutscenes
Watch through the credits to see a brief cutscene at the end

Church Tower Time to help Goldilocks
On the way to the church take note of the rickety bridge and the ton weight limit assigned to it
Take note also of the water flow of the river
How to steal the cheese truck Go the gate in the back of the church and see a hedgehog kid floating in the air holding balloons
Aim the peashooter on the balloon
Shoot at balloons and leave the last yellow balloon intact until the cheese wagon passes by
You can move about and the boy will still be there
When the cheese wagon is underneath shoot the last balloon to drop the hedgehog kid in the open topped cheese truck
It looks like that the kid falls outside the truck but he is in the truck if you do not see him on the road when the truck moves away
Follow the cheese truck to the warehouse
Watch as the cheese inspector finds the hedgehog kid inside the truck and no cheese
The hedgehog kid enters the Cheese Bros warehouse and eats all the cheese
Mr
Cheese and the cheese inspector are out of a job and the scam is stopped
Ride the wagon and fairy godmother explains how to drive the truck
Drive the truck directly underneath the stolen lead on the church rooftop
Enter the bell tower climb the bell rope to the roof and push the lead on to the truck
Drive through the rickety bridge and the bridge collapses
Look at the water flow of the river now and compare the flow of the river before the truck dammed the river
Forest Call the rainbird and fly over the forest and town
Note the inflow to the river around the reservoir comes from sources one is the river that comes in by the church in town that is now dammed up by the cheese truck
This river flows out to the swamp and to another branch that joins by the waterfall by the volcano in the forest to another source out of the world
The river flows out around the forest and the reservoir
There is a gate that holds back the river to the outside world just across Acre Gap and dams the water to fill the reservoir
The reservoir surrounds the Mysterious Isle
These river and reservoir system can be studied on the map also
Alight at the beach
It's a Beach Take a look around
The water level is very low
Go to the left side of the beach close to the reservoir and see that the Mysterious Isle has a pier with a boat tied to it somebody is there
Look down and see a phone booth in the water
Walk around the shore and Pointless bridge and still not find a way to get to the Mysterious isle
We need to lower the water table more to get there
Dragon by the waterfall How to get the key from the dragon's stomach Combine the stick with chewing gum to makechewing gum on the end of the pole

Go up the ladder to the roof and look at the stuck trap door
Go down
Use the dwarven keys on locked door
It might help to raise the gamma control here to be able to see better
Pick up thepetrolon the right side by the wall and look at the pulley system
Go to the other side of the wood wheel to see if we can raise the gate
Push the spoke and realized that you cannot raise the gate
Go to the corner by the wheel
Glitch on this part shows a ladder that leads to the roof of the hut at the corner but is really the ladder outside to go to the roof
Look up to the trap door on the right side of the pulley system
Use chakara to unstuck the trap door by aiming at the latch at the bottom side of the trap door
Simon will say quot Got it quot
Go back up to the roof and trap door and open the trap door
Yikes
Shortcut to enter hut
Pour gasoline on rope of the pulley mechanism
Now that you have sunlight from the trapdoor use mirror to light it
The rope holding the gate is cut and now the water is released
You can go directly to Mysterious Isle by phone booth or by the beach
It's a Beach or Mysterious Isle Look at the water table now and see that it is much lower
The phone booth by Mysterious isle is accessible
Walk towards the boat that is now hanging
Climb the rope that attached the boat to the pier
Go to the ruins of a church
See Melissa look down at the lowered water table
Enter and surprise Melissa
Give her the invitation automatically
Time to go meet everybody
Dog and Fruit Inn Calypso's Private Room Go back to Calypso at the Private Room
They are planning the assault on Sordid's fortress by sneak attack
They think that Simon will not be of help
A knock is heard and Runt enters with guards
He placed a magic barrier around the room
He disabled Coneman and blast Calypso also
Runt is filled with evil glee about catching Simon who he wants for himself and Calypso as well as the world's greatest heroes
When Runt leaves Melissa thinks that they should just wait it out but Simon thinks otherwise
Talk to all the heroes and exhaust ALL dialogue
Coneman will eventually get mad because of Simon's quot witty repartees quot and beats him up dead
Simon comes out alive by the front door of the Inn using the lifepad
Go back in the Inn and find out you cannot get through the barrier
Beer Garden Notice the open roof to the private room of Calypso
Talk to the boy on the tire swing
Fairy godmother appears to explain how to use the swing
Press the action key to start
Press the forward keys when the swing starts to go forward when the swing is at the very back close to you and the back keys when the swing starts to go backwards when the Simon's feet are up and the swing is far from you
Timing is necessary
Press the corresponding key when the swing is at the end of the motion forward or backwards
Pick up the length ofropewith the tire attached
Tie the rope to the picnic table
Watch the talk with Calypso I thought this is the funniest part of the game and cracked me up Sorry about the editorial We have to save the heroes taken by Runt to the fortress
The fortress is at the east and the entrance is through a rocky tunnel in the mountain
Call the rainbird and Sordid's fortress appears in the map
Fly east of Poliganis
Sordid's fortress See the camps of the invasion army surrounding the fortress entrance
There is an orc guarding the gate
He needs an identification card before he can let you in
Only gobbos orcs metal things and trolls n' stuff are allowed in
The covered bridge is closed by a gate
To get in the fortress the first time Change the color of your robe to black by using the spell book and selecting all colors
Enter the tunnel and carefully walk only on the dark areas
After passing orc guards you will hear a gobbos sing and march towards you
Crouch Z and quickly enter the lighted recess practice to find a place to hear them come go back to the recess crouch and enter
When the goblins march towards the opening of the cave when they are not on the screen anymore quickly go out stand up turn left and navigate the dark areas to the end of the hallway
Look in the mailbox by the bridge
Pick up the mail which is anorder for a crate of 'usual' from Sordid to the Green Grocerin Poliganis
Go back out of the fortress and do not worry about being caught this time
Call the rainbird and fly to Poliganis
Green Grocer It is still close
Use the order on the door of the greengrocer
Simon will insert it in the mail slot
Listen to the frightened grocers
A crate is dropped from above
Look on crate and see it marked with Sordid's address
It's full of cauliflowers
Now to find the hedgehog kid
Go to warehouse Cheese Bros Warehouse Talk to thehedgehog kidand you will pick him up
Go back to the Green Grocers Green Grocer Use the hedgehog kid on crate of cauliflower
He also hates cauliflower but will eat it if cheese covered
He is very full and feels like throwing up
Use the chakara on him to get him to cover the cauliflower with cheese
Then he eats it leaving an empty crate
Enter the empty crate now
Chapter Save the Universe After being hauled as groceries Simon climbs out of the box and finds himself inside Sordid Fortress
Colored Fireballs The object of this puzzle is to get up the ramp and evade or neutralize the fireballs
In some instances evading the fireball can be done by dodging out of the path or by crouching
Remember what the fairy godmother said If you get stuck in a magic place think of the colors you see
The best way is to change the color of the robe into the color of the released fireball
After changing to the color of the released fireball sprint up the ramp as fast as you can until the next fireball is released
The colored fireballs will be neutralized when it hits the same color of your robe
Change color of robe again and sprint until the top
Climb the ladder and enter Runt's laboratory
Runt's Laboratory You are stuck to the floor
Runt explains their diabolical plans
They found the location of the nexus the control center of the universe
Sordid is there making preparation for the invasion
Runt will follow soon after he does some adjustment needed to the matrix
They do not need the Magical Boots
Melissa and Coneman are imprisoned in a force field
The prisons are controlled by buttons that are in front of you one that releases the force field and the other changes them into something small
How to release the Melissa and Coneman Combine peashooter and magnifying lens
Simon said that using the Shift button will zoom in
Zoom and look straight on console with buttons in front of you
Target and shoot at the right release button
Use voodoo doll to awaken Coneman
Thanks Rolf
Coneman wakes up and goes for Runt but Runt changes him to a duck
Calypso arrives but accidentally pokes himself with his light saber and dies
Now Runt is out to get you with his light saber
When he first attacks you Runt said that his magic is absorbed by your robe How to fight Runt's colored light saber Again remember Fairy godmother's advice If you get stuck in a magic place think of the colors you see
Change to the different colors of the saber blast shot at you by Runt
Then run to similar colored button on the wall
When the colored blast hits you press the button to transfer Runt's magic to the buttons
Do all the buttons
Once all the colored buttons are glowing Runt's magic is gone and there will be power build up
Runt falls into the bottomless pit
Coneman's magic transformation was delayed and he as duck flies over the pit
His transformation back to human happened in an unlucky time and also falls in the pit
Melissa wakes up and together enters the Nexus gate opened by the power build up
Nexus There is a giant Swampy head above an entryway
Calypso's ghost appears using power from beyond
He states that the head is a representation of the builders of the nexus
Go to Swampy's head
Look at the head and Simon recommends that you sing the Swampling Song
Select the words to the Swampling song Swampling stew
Swampling stew
To your bog your swamp be true
Swampy be true
Swampling stew
Swampy's eyes light up and an entryway opens up
Magic red bridge Cross the bridge and be stopped by a Swampy guard
He explains that the bridge can only be crossed from the other side
No running or jogging allowed on the bridge
The bridge is just for people leaving the control center not going to it
How to cross magic bridge with Swampy guard The guard said no running or jogging so press and hold Shift key to walk forward
Since the bridge is only for going out and not entering when the guard comes out of the guard tower immediately turn back towards the entry door and walk like you are going out of the control center
Be sure to walk straight in the middle of the path and not veer off to the edge
Walk and not hesitate when the guard is outside the tower
Once on the magic red path count steps and then turned back to the start point guard comes out and looks around
Wait until he looks towards the entry door and as soon as he turns to look away turn back and continue the walk
Continue doing this until the other end
The guard comes out times until you reach the end of the bridge
Once across and see a black starry universe a major glitch happens
It will crash to the desktop
As soon as I saw that starry universe again after replaying I immediately pressed the spacebar and saved the game
After opening or loading the game a red blank screen is seen but still have the boxes on the top right
I opened the inventory and chose to call the rainbird and a graphic scene replaced the red screen and went on from there
Nexus Computer Room Go to the right and see Sordid lying on a bed looking like he is in a coma
Go to the left side and see Swampy lying on another bed breathing but out of it
Look at the computer and Calypso's ghost will appear Whoo hooo oooo
Calypso explains that Swampy's and Sordid's soul and body are separated
Sordid's soul entered the Nexus computer and took Swampy's with him
The Ancients are the creator of life universe and everything
Swampy is slang for the Ancients
The Nexus computer is the one that controls the universe and if the power supply is pulled out it will be the end of everything
Calypso knows so much because he is in quot Spirit Guide quot persona
Simon has to stop Sordid's vile plan by entering the nexus computer
His soul needs to be separated from his body
Calypso performed Simon's separation of soul and body
If something happened to either the soul or body the joining back will have a slim chance of happening
Enter the computer
Inside the Nexus Computer Find yourself inside the computer
It is best that as soon as you reach the passage going into the transporter that will get you to Sordid and Swampy retrace your steps going back to the transporter room with pads as a practice and to know the path to be taken
Swampy is glad to see you and ask that you help him
Sordid talks about his plan to use Swampy to change the automatic control of the Nexus to manual so that he can rule the universe
Swampy's ancestors generations back were the creators of the Nexus
Swampy being the last of his line can run the machine
Swampy presses a button and removes the automatic control
He pulls a lever to change it to manual
Oh Gee He did the memory erase and deleted the Nexus
Sordid escapes
You have minutes to get Swampy out and escape or escape by yourself
Swampy urges you to go and leave him because his leg is tied to a ball and chain
You can use the vacuum cleaner on Swampy but there would not be enough time to get back out
Decision time
Go to the portal by yourself or with Swampy and go through the maze again
The lights flicker on and off
Sordid flies to get outside the computer ahead of you
He knows the path so you can follow him if lost
You have to beat Sordid to the computer room and leave him trapped in the Nexus
Return Path to Nexus Control Room The object of the return path is to reach the transporter room with pads
The only variant from the path above is when you reach the blue ramp and go down you will get to a room with a single transporter pad and with FBI OMNI written on the wall
Be sure that before you continue the game you have the CD ROM with Auto Notification checked or on in the Device Manager of the computer you are playing on
Last puzzle Your body and Swampy's are still in their beds but Sordid's is gone
The computer is going haywire
There is no keyboard
You have a CD in inventory and no place to insert it
Since there is no eject button for the CD ROM drive of the Nexus computer eject your CD drive the one you are playing on You will get an eject auto notification
In some replays I did not get one
Click OK
If the game frame disappears just click it back up from the toolbar at the bottom of the desktop
The CD Rom drive of the Nexus computer in the game opens and Simon inserts the CD aka Seedy aka Magical Boots
The Nexus computer is now working
The computer asks quot Where would you like to go today quot Simon types quot Home quot
He realizes he needs Calypso for the joining of his body with his soul
While shouting for Calypso a body comes out of the Nexus computer
It is another Simon the Sorcerer trapped in the Nexus for a long time
The new Simon says that any good that exists an equal and opposite incarnation that is evil is
Those never meet but then they did
quot Got control of the universe have we
Right then let's have some fun quot says the Other Simon the Sorcerer
The End Watch the ending credits and see the outtakes from the making of the game

Click on the Create a profile button
Enter a name and click on OK Click on New game
Click on Adventure because if you choose Race against time it really is
I suggest you play the game as Adventure first and play it as a Race against time after that
Fair warning Although you play the game as Adventure it still is time based somehow
From time too time you receive phone calls from your wife
You also get sometimes the message that you are hungry
When you get a phone call from your wife you'll end up in your own suite to answer the call
After such phone call is over you have to go back to the game where you left it
When you are hungry the game takes you to the lounge to have dinner
After that you have to go back to the game where you left it also
And not only that
There are some things you cannot do before you get such messages
If you are playing the game to quickly these messages will only occur near the end of a day
This means that there are some things you cannot do or might be different as mentioned in my walkthrough
Therefore I strongly recommend that you do things exactly as mentioned in my walkthrough
While moving around you can run by clicking your left mouse button twice
You also can skip or end conversations by clicking your right mouse button during conversations
In my walkthrough I always run from one screen to another
So it's fine with me if you do the same
But beware don't ever skip or end any conversation to avoid these quot too late quot phone calls or hungry messages
By the way don't blame me for this
I probably hate it as much as you to listen to interminable stories

In this walkthrough I will not only mention the number of the declaration to use but also the declaration itself

So the numbers of the declarations may be different in your game
Be sure to use the correct declaration each and every time
Close the declaration window

Click on Adventure because if you choose Race against time it really is
I suggest you play the game as Adventure first and play it as a Race against time after that
Fair warning Although you play the game as Adventure it still is time based somehow
From time too time you receive phone calls from your wife
You also get sometimes the message that you are hungry
When you get a phone call from your wife you'll end up in your own suite to answer the call
After such phone call is over you have to go back to the game where you left it
When you are hungry the game takes you to the lounge to have dinner
After that you have to go back to the game where you left it also
And not only that
There are some things you cannot do before you get such messages
If you are playing the game to quickly these messages will only occur near the end of a day
This means that there are some things you cannot do or might be different as mentioned in my walkthrough
Therefore I strongly recommend that you do things exactly as mentioned in my walkthrough
While moving around you can run by clicking your left mouse button twice
You also can skip or end conversations by clicking your right mouse button during conversations
In my walkthrough I always run from one screen to another
So it's fine with me if you do the same
But beware don't ever skip or end any conversation to avoid these quot too late quot phone calls or hungry messages
By the way don't blame me for this
I probably hate it as much as you to listen to interminable stories

Be sure to use the correct declaration each and every time

I would like to briefly mention a few important tactics The enemies that you ll face have excellent ranged attacks but in many cases it s still best to attack them from a distance as some of them will explode in your face if they get close to you For the most part I won t mention the presence or locations of the enemies unless special tactics or actions are required to defeat them Watch for mines that have been placed in your path and destroy them from a safe distance When you re in dark areas remember to use your wrist beacon to shed some light on the subject you can complete the game without using your wrist beacon but it s a nice piece of equipment

guy that won t shut up but again I don t believe that it matters if he gets killed Use each of the three consoles that surround a large column near the center of this area you ll then have to deal with another wave of enemies There is a side alley where there is a supply container if you want to take the time to find it As you ll remember you descended a ladder from the large cylindrical platform to reach this floor Find the other ladder on this floor and climb it Do a balance beam act to the other side of the room drop down to another set of thin beams then another Drop down to the short duct pipe and crawl through the tunnel Push through another grate and jump down Go through the door and watch for the ladder on the R if you continue along the corridor you ll just reach a dead

a supply container nearby Step onto the beam that s near the ladder you just descended At the intersections go R then straight Step off of the beam and you ll find a supply container This next sequence is extremely difficult because enemies are infinite if you kill one another one will just teleport in to replace him I m not going to describe this entire area but it s not that big Run around until you find that guy who won t shut up he s down in a valley like area He ll produce the Level Access Card even if he s killed by enemies Now all you need to do is find the elevator out of this area It has a grate like door and two access panels to its L and R Use the Level Access Card on the R panel and the elevator door will open Jump into the elevator and hit the button to ride it up Exit the elevator and go L Go through the opening and use the console Walk around to the other side of the core thing and carefully drop down to the thin pathway below Once you successfully manage to land on the pathway step to a safe area where blue blasts are not being fired only one hit from a blue blast will kill you There are four tubes that lead out of here but only one isn t blocked Time your move then run through the open tunnel When you reach an open area step L or R to avoid being blasted Time your move through another blast tunnel then another After that you end up in a room full of enemies and that guy that won t shut up Use the green button on the wall to call an elevator then ride it up You arrive in a room with supply containers and a cabinet that contains a Polaron Pulse Rifle Cross the room and use the green button to open the door Go through the door and stay L if you stray into the open you ll soon be dead You ll see a cylindrical hole nearby Find the ladder inside that cylinder and descend Follow the cylinder to an intersection and go L going R just leads to a dead end Keep going there s only one route until you are emptied into an open area guarded by lasers Quickly go L and hide behind the large rocks to avoid the laser fire Time your move and make a run through the disconnected pipe for cover then make another run to the next pipe Keep going through this tunnel again there s only one route until you see a ladder on your L Climb it then follow the tunnel to a grate and push through it to enter a room with guards Use the green wall mounted button then jump onto the nearby lift to reach the floor above There s a supply container on this floor Climb the ladder There s another supply container on this floor As always I chose to not kill the person that s unarmed Use the console near the unarmed woman to disable the lasers and open the door that s two floors down Be prepared for the guards that storm into the room Go two floors down and exit through the open door
KIRA S MISSION Talk to everyone then head to a Turbolift Talk to everyone that you d like then go through an Airlock to begin the next mission Do not draw your weapon or your Tricorder or you ll come under attack Also do not punch or kick anything Go straight ahead and use the button to the L of the huge door then go inside If you climb the ladder to the upper level you ll find a supply container but you can t take its contents because any show of violence will trigger the alarm Exit the building and go L Keep going until you find a guard near a door blocked by a force field Notice the huge rotating laser gun atop a nearby building You need to kill this guard but you must avoid being toasted by the laser Stand near the building with the laser so that the laser can t target you Draw your Phaser Pistol and kill him a second guard will show up so you must also kill him Once these two guards are killed holster your weapon If the alarm has been triggered reload a save game and try again you must kill these two guards without triggering the alarm Use the button to the L of the force field then quickly go through the doorway Once through hug the wall to the R and you ll eventually come to another huge door Use the button to the L of this door to learn that Level Military Access is required Continue along and stay to the R You ll come to a small building that can be entered by either one of two doors Through the first door on the R is a supply container but you must leave it alone for now Exit this room then go through the next door to access a second room in this small building Go upstairs and talk to the woman She ll tell you that your Level Access Card will be processed tomorrow Go back down the stairs and exit through the door that s straight ahead the one through which you did not enter Hug the wall to the R and you ll reach a door that can be opened by Military Personnel only With your back to that door walk straight ahead a short distance and enter the building on your L this is the Security Control building Kill the guard that s patrolling in here making sure that the alarm is not triggered At the bottom and to the R of the first set of stairs is a force field generator This is a clue for where to look for the other force field generator in this building Walk to the back of this building where there is an active force field Locate the force field generator that s just beyond the force field now that you know where to find it Use your Tricorder to determine the force field s frequency then blast it with your Phaser Pistol it s a tight shot but you can do it Once the force field is eliminated enter the room and use the far console to shut down the security nodes No matter what I did the alarm went off and guards rushed into the building Luckily you shouldn t have to deal with more than four of them then they ll stop coming inside Make sure your weapon is holstered then exit this building and turn R Walk to the locked door in the distance then hug the wall keeping it to your L until you return to the door that leads back into the room with a guard and the woman who told you about your Level Access Card Although the alarm is screaming the guard did not attack me Draw your weapon and kill the guard Thankfully no other guards rushed into this building when I killed him this must be because the security nodes are now disabled Holster your weapon Go upstairs and the woman will now hand over a Level Science Pass At this point you can blast open the supply containers as long as there are no guards nearby but even if there is a guard nearby just kill him because other guards should no longer come and join the fight Go back down the stairs and exit through the door that s straight ahead Approach the alarm on your L and use the Level Science Pass to shut it off Now turn yourself so that the alarm is on your R Hug the wall keeping it to your R and you ll soon reach the door that requires a Military Pass With your back to that door walk straight ahead If you keep walking perfectly straight you ll walk right into the Research Center building Approach the card reader on the L side of its huge door and use the Level Science Pass to get inside Step onto the large platform and use the panel to take a ride down Talk to the guy then exit through the door You need to meet up with Emi Belor Here s how Go R go around a corner that goes to the R veer L at the intersection go around a corner that goes to the L veer L at the intersection zig zag around a couple of corners go R at the next intersection and finally go L when you reach the circular pathway When she sees you she ll tell you to follow her But don t follow her If you follow her nothing happens and she just walks along the same route over and over You need to kill her to obtain the Level Science Pass I found it best to kill her in the circular area where you first find her while making sure that no one in one of the side rooms can see you Only the guard standing out in the main hallway will rush in to see what s going on and you can easily deal with him After obtaining the Level Science Pass holster your weapon and exit to the main hallway Go R then go L at the intersection and continue past the two sets of stairs on your L You ll come to a V intersection Take the L path then go up the first walkway on your R Approach the card reader to the R of the door in this area and use your Level Science Pass to open it Without triggering the alarm kill the guard in this room After killing the guard the woman in this room will hand over the Level Science Pass You must now kill the woman and the other man in this room or they ll set off the alarm Also in this room is a supply container Holster your weapon and return to the main hallway Go L

STILL LIFE WALKTHROUGH BY MALCOLM SCHMIDT NAVIGATION MENU GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
ldquo Still Life rdquo lasers puzzle
Micro walkthrough Len Green th May lengreen hotmail com By far the main call for help to date in ldquo Still Life rdquo and maybe criticism
on the various Games Forums has been over the lsquo lasers puzzle rsquo The solution is not too easy to describe in words Hence it has only been able to help by sending save games
IMO this is less than satisfactory since amongst other legitimate reasons some players have problems or dislike having to use the save games of other gamers
The following is an attempt to enable all players to overcome this puzzle themselves without too much difficulty It should be possible to finish without ANY particularly fast amp or hurried actions Also it can be completed without the necessity of more than say a couple of replays due to natural mishaps
My thanks to Dennis for permission to use his graphic which I rsquo ve extracted from the ldquo Still Life rdquo walkthrough written by MaG on the GameBoomers Forum It has been an enormous help to me personally It also provides a visual verification of each of the following series of steps together with their rationale
Use theUp Right Left keyboard arrowsONLY hellip andnotyour mouse at all That way you can keep your eye all the time on the spider robot movements Also the mouse clickable arrows on the screen are quite quirky whereas the keyboard arrows aren rsquo t
N B Clicking theUp arrow doesnot generally cause the spider robot to move UPWARDS It moves itforwardone square in the direction it was facing at that time Right click causes the spider robot to turn to ITS right hellip left click similarly
In the lsquo dangerous rsquo portions of the trek remember the movesby heart so that you only have to look at amp concentrate entirely on the screen amp or the keyboard arrows
This is generally very easy since there are only or moves to remember each time However in one place ONLY there are more moves to remember hellip in all However if you repeat these if necessary a few times to yourself you can easily remember them hellip youalwayshave as much time as you like to do this during the safe rest period s
In the following the safe moves in which you can take as much time as you want are marked with lower case bold blue colored letters and not underlined i e u r l The dangerous moves which should follow each other with no pause or hesitations are marked with upper case bold red colored letters and underlined hellip U R L IMO the main cause of failure isnotknowing more or less exactly WHEN to start each of the lsquo difficult rsquo sections These depend each time upon the movement of the lasers and are described here as best I can in bold pink colored italics hellip they are constantly periodic amp repetitive and fortunately not random
A Any time hellip hellip hellip
u u r u
B Immediately after the two lasers cross one another hellip hellip hellip
U U
C Any time hellip hellip hellip
l u u u
D Observe the square above the one you are at rest on now Observe a laser beam arriving on that square and moving upwards Just after it starts its upward swing hellip hellip hellip
U R U
E Any time hellip hellip hellip
l u r
F THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT SECTION BY FAR
Observe the square to the right of the one you are at rest on now Observe a laser beam arriving on that square and moving downwards Notice how about rds of its downward swing it sweeps past the top left corner of a grating on the rear wall At this moment hellip hellip hellip
U L U U R U L U
G Any time hellip hellip hellip
r u u l u u l u u r
H Observe the square to the right of the one you are at rest on now As soon as the laser hits the middle of this square hellip hellip hellip
U hellip and keep your finger on it to the fiery end
ADDITIONAL HELP ASSISTANCE hellip IMPORTANT
It helps to turn the music completely off for this puzzle and increase your speakers' volume substantially hellip that way you can hear the clicking of the spider's legs hellip which is very helpful Before starting each section apart from lsquo learning rsquo the moves by heart so that you really don rsquo t have to look at the keyboardat all it rsquo s worth while carefully watching the ONE ONLYrelevantlaser in each case a few times in order to clearly see its lsquo orbit rsquo amp adjust to its rhythm The trickiest part probably is to CONSTANTLY watch amp listen to the spider only
You must not pauseAT ALLbetween each of your keyboard clicks However occasionally you may quite likely find yourself being lsquo over eager rsquo and clicking BEFORE the spider is lsquo ready to react rsquo hellip but if when you see this it can generally be rectifiedimmediately

All rights reserved
Please note that this walkthrough is copyrighted
Anyattempt to reproduceanythingfrom this walkthrough will beseverelypunished to themaximumextent of the law
Kindly address all your comments and questions toZSZUBAIRIE AOL com The Walkthrough GENERALLY Please disregard anything that you might have heard or read to the contrary This is in fact a very easy point and click game It is also what I would call a quot fair quot game I am sure many of you have played games where the solutions to puzzles were quite quot counter intuitive quot The developers of these games do not seem to realize that the use of such quot techniques quot makes the puzzles hard only because their quot solutions quot would never work in real life Thus instead of being fascinated by the developers' ingenuity the gamers are only aggravated by the trickery I am happy to tell you that Still Life isnotsuch a game
THE MANUAL As I mentioned the game is actually quite easy mainly because everything flows so logically All you have to do is put yourself in the position of the main character and you will realize what you need to do But while the game is pretty easy in that sense the gameplaycan be somewhat complex if you are unfamiliar with the basic quot mechanics quot of the game It would be a good idea therefore to at least skim through the manual to become familiar with those basics You will find that manual on the DVD itself Here is how to get to it Click onSTART then go to ALL PROGRAMS gt MICROIDS gt STILL LIFE gt STILL LIFE MANUAL You need to skim through only pages actually pages according to the numbering in the toolbar at the top of the screen starting with the section called quot The Story quot and ending with the one called quot Dialogs quot Feel free to just print out pages to make it easier to refer to them as needed as you play the game
BUILT IN HELP To be perfectly honest I did not turn this feature on I just love a good challenge you know So I cannot tell you just how helpful it really is But you can read about this feature on page of the Manual You can find the feature in the game itself as follows
Click onOPTIONSin the Main Menu
Click onGAMEin the top right corner of the Options menu
The quot HELP SYSTEM ACTIVATED quot is the second item on the Game Menu
Please be sure to check what the default setting is on Help I believe that it is actually quot yes quot So if you would rather not have any help you need to click quot no quot SAVES Game manuals and walkthrough writers will often tell you that you must save your game frequently That mightnotbe a good idea in this game I hate to tell you this but the developers were extremely unwise in this respect For one thing it is a long game It is also quite complex just full of rich graphics and sounds The downside is that each saved game therefore takes up a lot of space on your hard drive anywhere from megabytes So depending on how many games you save you can easily clutter up the available space on your hard drive In other words depending on how large your hard drive is it can really slow down your game
If that was not bad enough the developers did not provide an option to simply delete an old game from the ones showing on your Load Menu While youcan quot overwrite quot an earlier game by saving a new one on it the computer still retains the IMAGE of the overwritten save Frankly I have no idea why the developers considered it important to save the image of a game on your computer even after you deleted the game itself But the bottom line is that depending on the number of times you overwrite the images of the overwritten games still linger on taking up unnecessary space on your hard drive and possibly slow down your game
Now I know how useful it is to save frequently and how painful it can be to have to go back a long way if something happens and you have to resort to your last save And believe me as easy as it is to play this game and even though you do get more than enough time to beat the timed sequences it is still possible to fail In that case it is Game Over of course and unlike some games which automatically start you off from the point where you ran out of time this game requires you toreload an earlier save So yes thatcanbe a pain especially if that save was a long way back It can also be rather confusing trying to remember what you had or had not already done before you had saved the game
In short the lack of foresight on the developers' part has created quite a dilemma for the gamers I would definitelynotencourage anyone to fiddle with the saved games in the Programs folder of your computer especially if you have little or no experience in that respect The best advice that I can give you is do save as frequently as you feel comfortable but just make sure you have plenty of space on your hard drive
THE STORY If you have played Still Life then you might recall how that story was divided between two characters Victoria Mcpherson the heroine and her grandfather Gus Mcpherson As you might also recall the grandfather's story was already wrapped up in that game but the heroine's ended up in something of a cliffhanger We never found out who the killer was
Now I don't want to spoil anyone's fun So I will not give anything away about the plot of the present game Rather my intention is just to introduce you to thestructureof the story itself so no one will get confused in any way Basically this game is also divided between two characters Victoria Mcpherson our old heroine again andPaloma Hernandez a reporter Both their stories take place in the same timeline the present From time to time however the heroine Victoria or Vic will have flashbacks from an earlier time In order to avoid any confusion therefore I have divided up the following walkthrough into sections according to the two characters as well as the different time lines for Victoria You will get a better idea of what I mean as you read the walkthrough
Well that's all I can think of by way of any general instructions So let's get on with a more step by step walkthrough of the game Hope you will enjoy it
Prologue Los Angeles Victoria The opening cutscene is actually the final cutscene from Still Life which is a great way to start the game reminding us of how that first game had ended That final cutscene from the first game is followed by another cutscene the beginning of the present game We are told that we are in Los Angeles and that the date is January This is actually a flashback The real story i e that of the present game begins in The flashbacks actually serve as fillers to help us understand how we got from the end of the previous game to the present one
The cutscenes are immediately followed by a phone call from Claire As you will recall she was the coroner in the previous story and also a friend and one time teacher of our heroine Vic Exhaust all topics of the conversation with her At the end of the conversation a box entitled quot Objectives quot will pop up in the upper left corner of the screen If you listen closely you will also notice a short pause in the background music at this point
AUTO SAVE The above mentioned pause indicates that your game has been automatically saved If at any time in the game you would like to be sure to have a save of your game at the same point where the quot auto save quot occurs be sure to save it yourself because each auto save is overwritten by the next one The auto save will not appear in your Save menu but it does appear in the Load Menu You can recognize it quite easily by the fact that it will have the yellow icon of a computer in the lower right corner of the saved image
NOTIFICATIONS The game will notify you whenever you have recorded a document image etc
or received a text message or a message on your voicemail or have been given a clear objective you must follow such as the one you just received In order to check any of these do as follows Click on your right mouse button You will be presented with a screen The first time that you access this screen the inventory will be in the center and your cell phone the quot Smartphone quot will be in the upper left corner of the screen Click on the phone to bring it to the center The inventory will be moved to the right represented by the x matrix The Objectives should be on the phone screen because you were just notified of one Click on each of the two objectives you see one by one and a more detailed explanation will appear at the bottom of your screen If you would ever like to refer to the Objectives and they are not already showing on your phone just click on theChecklisticon at the bottom center of the phone screen You can refer to any documents you have collected by clicking on the yellowFoldericon in the lower left corner of your phone screen You can check your text messages or messages recorded on your voicemail by clicking on theEnvelopeicon in the lower right corner of your phone screen
Check your Objectives Then check your messages you have two both from Richard Just click on theEnvelopeicon in the lower right corner of the phone screen as explained above The next phone screen will show two envelopes on the left and the name of the person who sent the message and the date that the message had been sent on the right of each envelope Click on these envelopes one by one to hear each message When you are done exploring everything you would like to explore on the phone or in the inventory click on the right mouse button again to return to your game

Click on Garris to talk to him again Address the topic at the top first and then the one below it At the end of the second topic the CSIA quot Crime Scene Investigation amp Analysis quot Field Kit will automatically pop up in view See the Game Manual in the game DVD for details about this Kit The following text box gives a general description of the contents of the Kit and how to use it
THE CSIA FIELD KIT Contents As you can see the lower half of the Kit consists of two sections The left section contains the instruments you will need to collect the clues The right section is an inventory of the clues you collect Although there are only spaces in that inventory at the moment more quot pages quot will be added as you gather more clues You will then be able to turn the pages to access those clues
Manual The quot Test Kit Manual quot is in fact the first item in the upper left corner of the inventory Click on it and an image will appear in the Blue Screen in the upper half of the Kit Click on that image to quot open quot the file and read the two pages describing the instruments contained in and the analyses conducted with the help of the Kit
General Instructions on Collecting the Clues When you close up on a clue you will see a white icon on it Click on that icon and Victoria will either tell you something about the clue or give you a hint as to how to collect it A blue hand icon will then appear on the object Bring out an instrument from the Kit and use it on the object If that is the correct and the only instrument you need to use the Kit will spring back in view and you will find that a new clue has been added to the inventory on your right Put the instrument back in its original slot in the Kit and then click on the clue in the inventory An image of the clue will then appear on the left of theBlue Screenin the top half of the Kit Usually you will need to use only one of the three analysis buttons on the right of the Blue Screen to analyze the clue I suggest however that you click onall three buttons one by one because some clues need to be analyzed in different ways
Sometimes you will need to use two instruments on the same object to collect a clue In that case the instrument will remain out of the inventory and you will continue to see a blue hand icon on the object even after using that instrument In that case right click to get the Kit out and then use another instrument on the same object Again if you have used the correct instruments and the second instrument was the last one you needed to use the Kit will pop back up in view and you will find a new clue added to the inventory on your right Proceed as instructed above to then analyze the clue
The above instructions will become clearer as you start collecting and analyzing the clues in the walkthrough that follows

Killer's House Paloma The Cell Note the pulsating red aura around the screen This means that Paloma is hurt but we don't know what is wrong just yet Go to the cell phone the blinking green dot on the ground a bit left of the door Try to pick it up but Paloma gets hurt by the broken glass around it Try again and you will be able to pick it up this time A dialog follows and now we know just what is wrong with Paloma she has been poisoned and we must find an antidote for her quickly because the countdown clock has begun to run in the upper right corner of the screen
NOTE SAVE YOUR GAME AT THIS POINT
Don't worry about the clock too much though there is more than enough time to beat it Also feel free to check out your objectives becausethe clock STOPS any time you open the Inventory Menu to check your objectives or something in the actual inventory or to go to the Main Menu Click at the lower right corner of the screen and go to the First Aid cabinet on the wall there Try to open the cabinet but it is too high to reach
NOTE To avoid any confusion theHEADBOARDrefers to the end of the bed next to the gray board with the white writing while theFOOTBOARDrefers to the end of the bed closest to the First Aid cabinet As you will see you can move the bed only to the left or to the right and the gear icon to do this appears only on theHeadboard
So go to the Headboard in the lower left corner of the screen and click on the gear icon on it to move the bed under the First Aid cabinet Click on the cabinet now to open it Pick up theBOTTLE FILLED WITH TWO THIRDS the bottle with the green liquid from the bottom shelf Paloma will tell us that according to the label the bottle is a chemical reactant quot to separate the true from the false quot Pick up theTUBES FILLED WITH LIQUID WHICH ONE
a set of four vials from the upper shelf Click on this set and then the quot Separate quot icon to the right of the inventory to SEPARATE the four vials in the set Note that each vial has a different colored cap on it
THE PROBLEM Only one of the four vials contains the antidote The other three vials are apparently filled with poison because Paloma will die instantly regardless of the time remaining on the countdown clock if she drinks from any one of these other vials Therefore the object of the puzzle is to determine which of these four vials has the antidote Unfortunately I cannot tell you which vial contains the antidote because that is determinedrandomlyby the computer So I can only help youfigure outthe solution yourself
THE SOLUTION Combine thebottle with the green liquidwith one of the four vials IF THE VIAL CONTAINS THE ANTIDOTE THE LIQUID IN IT WILL TURN BLACK OTHERWISE IT WILL TURN WHITE If the liquid turns black right click to open the Inventory Menu pick up that vial from the inventory and click on Paloma's card which is left of the inventory to have her drink from it Paloma will tell us that she is feeling better and you will hear the Killer's comment in the background But if the liquid in the vial doesNOTturn black combine thebottle with the green liquid now calledBOTTLE FILLED WITH ONE THIRD with another vial Again if the liquid in the vial turns black have Paloma drink it otherwise DON'Tor she will die and you will have to start over
Unfortunately there is only enough green liquid in the bottle to test two vials After that thebottle with the green liquidwill disappear from your inventory But don't worry Even if neither vial you tried turned black you have at least eliminated those vials from consideration Thus you now have a chance of getting the right vial from the two that are left In other words GUESS Just pick up one of the twountestedvials and click on Paloma's card left of the inventory If it is the correct vial you will hear Paloma's comment and then that of the Killer in the background Otherwise you will get a morbid cutscene showing her die and will then be told to RELOAD your last save to try again Just remember the computerrandomly decideswhich vial will contain the antidote each time you load the game to retry So don't think that if the vial with the red cap for instance would have been the correct vial in the game where you failed that it would also be the correct vial the next time you try
The countdown clock will disappear as soon as Paloma takes the antidote Step out of the close up on the First Aid cabinet and click on the wall poster left of that cabinet Click on the gray wall cabinet the Storage which is left of the poster Put away the unused vials and thebottle with the green liquid if any in that Storage

Note Depending on how long it took you to get to this point since you called Claire about the license plate you should be receiving a call from her about it at this point Victoria will answer that call and a dialog will follow At the end of that conversation go out into the Main Hall and step out into the Front Yard
Front Yard Sheriff Halloway Talk to the Sheriff standing to the right of her car You can conduct the conversation any way you like but I prefer the following order Ask the Sheriff first about theReceipt for Medications Victoria will comment that we need to tell Claire about the Sheriff's information and the dialog will be suspended apparently for that purpose So call Claire and Victoria will give her the information
Talk to the Sheriff again this time about theMissing Clues Call Claire again Now talk to the Sheriff again this time about theObstruction of the Investigation Note that during this conversation the Sheriff indicates giving Victoria two clues as well as an quot Electronic Key quot that she has found You will find the Key in your inventory and the two clues quot Fibers Collected by Halloway quot and quot Product Collected by Halloway quot in the Kit Analyze both of these clues Note you will have to run the Chemical Analysis and then the Database Analysis on the Product
Front Yard Garris Go and talk to Garris who is still sitting on the left side of the house by the fence that divides the Front and the Back Yards Again you can conduct the conversation in any order you like Note however that when you address the topic on the Blue Door on the landing down the Cellar a cutscene will actually take you to that door But Garris will leave shortly thereafter while you will remain by the Blue Door So you will have to go back to him all the way out to the Front Yard if you talked to him about the Blue Door before the Charred Door So in order to avoid this running in and out of the house after him I prefer to conduct the conversation in the following order
Sheriff Halloway

Living Room Safe We must now try to figure out the code for opening theSafein the bookcase left of the fireplace So close up on that Safe and focus on the buttons with thesmudged fingerprintson them Ignore the Red Button with the arrow pointing right because that is apparently only a RESET button The Green Button with quot OK quot on it is also not important because as you already know from having used a similar keypad down in the Morgue we have to press that button after punching in any code So the clue to the Safe's code lies in the five buttons other than the Red and Green buttons i e A All we have to do now is figure out theorderin which these five buttons must be pressed to open the Safe
Step out of the close up go to the right of the fireplace and click on the DVD on the sofa to learn that the movie quot The Blue Dahlia quot had come out in or the samenumbersthat had smudged fingerprints on them on the Safe Thus we now have the order in which those numbers must be pressed But we still need to figure out where the letter quot A quot goes Consult the document that Garris had given you earlier quot Documentation on Metalyr's LK Model quot and note the quot Default Factory Code quot given on the first page of that document A Thus it is at leastlikelythat the letter quot A quot might be the third button that must be pressed to open the Safe as well Give it a try Close up on the Safe
Click on A and then pressOK
Victoria tells us that the Safe is open and steps out of the close up Close up on the Safe again and click on theStack of Papersin the top shelf to hear Victoria's comment Collect the clue by using theFINGERPRINT POWDERand then the D SCANNER Analyze the clue to learn that we will need Claire's help again
Note Do not try to call Claire while you are still in the Inventory Menu because as I found a technical bug kicks in and you won't be able to close up on the Safe again to check out the other item inside the pink and white box in the bottom shelf So step out of both the Inventory Menu and the close up on the Safe before you call Claire Exhaust the conversation Close up on the Safe again and click on theBoxin the bottom shelf Victoria will pick up the Box and put it on the table in front of the Safe Close up on the Box and click on it to learn that it is locked Use thePICK GUNto open the box and hear Victoria's comment
Step out of the close up on the Box At this point you should receive a call from Claire If you don't just wait a little while until it comes Victoria will automatically answer of course and a dialog will follow

We are now ready to meet Hawker So go down to the Main Hallway in the First Floor As Victoria comes downstairs a cutscene will take us out into the Front Yard
Front Yard Conversations After the cutscene a dialog with Garris will follow Note that he will leave as soon as you tell him about the Console So save this topic for last if you would like to address the other topics first But although I don't know if it affects the storyline in any way I personally prefernotto say much about the case in front of Hawker until those quot differences quot mentioned in one of the Objectives for this part of the game between him and Victoria have been resolved So I prefer to go directly toELECTRONICS EXPERTand talk to Garris about theBroken Console leaving the other topics for a later time
As Garris leaves a dialog with Hawker will follow Exhaust the conversation He will then also leave Call Claire and talk to her about Hawker Then go in the house and up to the Charred Room on the second floor to continue your conversation with Garris

Computer Room Information Hawker will step aside after he has figured out the password for you It is time to see what we can learn from the computer So close up on the computer click on the Keyboard and start checking out the files There is a lot of information that is now available to us But don't worry Just try to keep track of what you check out Thus be sure to check outALLthe Categories Internet Search Photos amp Videos etc
Topicswithin each Category
Pageswithin each Topic
Notethe following as you proceed The very first topic in theInternet Searchis the Technical Manual that Garris had asked Victoria to find in order to help him fix the Surveillance Console in the Charred Room As you click on that topic the Manual will be automatically printed out by the Printer which is to the right of the Computer Table Victoria will step back from the computer apparently to allow you to step out of the close up and pick up the Manual from the Printer But I suggest you wait until you have finished looking up all the information in the computer so you won't lose track of where you were in that investigation
Be sure to watch theVideoofOctober closely the first time because it plays onlyonceduring the game
The Text File in theCodescategory is quot encrypted quot Again I would suggest that you continue your examination of everything else that youcanexamine on the computer so you won't lose track of what you have and have not yet checked After you have finished doing so click on theblueicon now on theProcessor the small gray box right of the Monitor to hear Victoria's comment Then bring out theCOMPUTER KEYfrom your Kit and click on theProcessoragain Victoria will indicate that the encrypted file has now been decrypted Check it out by clicking on the Computer's Keyboard then onCodes and then on what is now the quot Decrypted Text File quot to see the contents of that File As you close the document a dialog will follow You will then receive a New Document You can check out that document in your cell phone where it has been stored as the quot Decrypted Code File quot Every time that I played this game theGroup Camerasrecording in theSurveillance Camerascategory seemed to skip or go too quickly past the first image of the recording the first time that I would play it So you might want to play this recordingtwice
We are done with this room at least for now So step out of the close up on the computer pick up thePRINTED TECHNICAL MANUALfrom the Printer and go upstairs to Garris in the Charred Room on the Second Floor

Step out of the close up on the Console and talk to Garris again Then leave the room and go downstairs into the Kitchen
Kitchen Radio Sheriff Close up on the Dining Table in the lower right corner of the screen Click on theRadio A dialog will follow bringing you out of the close up automatically Talk to the Sheriff on your right Another dialog will follow Exhaust the conversation Feel free to check out your New Objectives Talk to the Sheriff again Note The Talk icon is misplaced You will now find it slightly to therightof the Sheriff
The Sheriff has given you the Keys to her car Go out into the Front Yard and down the stairs Use theKEY TO THE SHERIFF'S CARto open the trunk of her car Pick up theMETAL DETECTOR
The Metal Detector Victoria will comment about using the Instructions Manual to see how the Detector works The Manual will be presented to you automatically Read it If you need to consult it later you will find it stored as the quot Metal Detector Settings quot in the New Documents folder in your cell phone
Step out of the close up on the trunk of the Sheriff's car We must now use the Metal Detector to find the hatch to that Fallout Shelter that the Sheriff and Victoria discussed in the Kitchen and that has been mentioned in our Objectives Refer to the Yellow Textbox below for some tips in using the Metal Detector in our search for the Shelter hatch
Tips on Using the Metal Detector Open the Inventory Menu Note that an image of the Metal Detector appears both inside and outside to the left of the inventory
The image of the Metal Detectoroutsidethe inventory serves two purposes
First that image will appeargrayed outin areas where itcannotbe used Note that the Metal Detector can be used only in the Front or Back yard
Second you must click on that image to change the Metal Detector Settings Note that theDefault Settingon the Metal Detector is quot quot indicating that it isOFF In order to turn the Metal DetectorON you must change the Settings to or
It is only after you turn the Metal DetectorONthat you will be able to pick up what we will call theMetal Detector Alarm MDA cursor see picture below indicating the presence of an object that the Metal Detector is supposed to detect
You must check for theMDAcursors by moving your cursor over any given area undereachDetector setting through one by one
When you see theMDAcursor open the Inventory Menu click on the Metal Detectorinsideyour inventory and close the Inventory Menu A cutscene will then show Victoria using the Detector to examine the spot where we had found the cursor She will then tell us what she found and whether the object is of any use to us
Note Sometimes you will see the MDA cursor but when you try to use the Metal Detector inside the inventory Victoria will snap that quot It's not this quot or something like that Don't worry All that means is that you must examine that spot under another Metal Detector setting So just try the three other Settings one by one bringing out the Metal Detector from your inventory each time you change the Setting until you get the cutscene showing Victoria using the Metal Detector
The above tips will become clearer as you actually start using the Metal Detector
Examining the Front Yard You will find the following objects in the Front Yard at the location and by using the Metal Detector settings given parenthetically after each object

Step out of the close up on Victoria's Cell Go and talk to Anderson in his cell Exhaust the conversation Step out of the close up on Anderson's cell Try to open Paloma's cell door but it is still locked of course Close up on theDigital Lockon the wall right of the door But we don't know the code Step out of that close up and talk to Anderson about this lock He tells us that the code to Paloma's cell door consists of or numbers that he is sure the code begins with a and thinks that the last number is a But we still need more information
Go and talk to Victoria again She tells us about that list of codes in which her name is associated withSTANTON while Paloma's is associated withMARTIN
The Digital Locks The key to this puzzle is as follows As you know there are letters of the alphabet To decode you must transcribe each letter of the Name associated with the Code into the number of theorderin which that letter appears in the alphabet Thus A B C etc
If the number consists of two digits you must add the two digits together to get a single digit Thus for example Z
As Victoria indicated the Name associated with the Code for the Digital Lock to Paloma's cell door isMARTIN So we decode it as follows
M A R T I N Go to Paloma's cell door close up on the Digital Lock right of the door and click in the above code and then onOK You will hear the door unlock and get a cutscene of the door Step out of the close up on the Digital Lock and enter Paloma's cell

Go to Victoria's cell at the lower left corner of the screen Close up on the Digital Lock right of the cell door We use the same technique as we did to open Paloma's cell door to figure out the Code for the Digital Lock to Victoria's cell As Victoria indicated the Name associated with that Code isSTANTON So we decode it as follows
S T A N T O N So click in the above code and then onOK You will hear the door unlock and get a cutscene of the door Step out of the close up Enter Victoria's cell and talk to her Note a New Objective notification will appear but if you stop the conversation there and check out your objectives you will find that there is really nonewobjective So it is a technical bug in the game of course
Click on the topic of the Amphetamines to give the pills to Victoria A cutscene and dialog will follow The story will then switch to Victoria's point of view Butnote there will be no Auto Save or caption like the one I have given below when the story switches the point of view this time
Killer's House Victoria Fallout Shelter Victoria's point of view will begin as a New Objective notification appears in the upper left corner of the screen and a Note in red appears at the bottom of the screen informing that the objects from Paloma's inventory have been transferred to the Storage i e the Gray Cabinet out in the Side Corridor

Go into the Side Corridor right of the Ladder Open theMedicine Cabineton the wall on your right Click on the smallBoxin the bottom shelf to hear Victoria's comment Step out of the close up on the Medicine Cabinet Feel free to check out theGray Cabinet Storage on the wall on your left But I would suggest not cluttering our inventory with any of Paloma's objects just yet So leave the Storage as it is for now

WARNING
Save your game here Not because of the storyline but because of atechnical bugthat is sometimes triggered in the game sequence that shortly follows The bug is in fact serious enough to prevent you from finishing the game So if the bugistriggered and you have saved the game here you can just come back to this Save to try again Otherwise you will have to go all the way back to wherever you had last saved your game
The Computer Room Recall that the Computer Room is divided into two parts theEmpty Section which has nothing but three oil or gas cans along the wall right of the door and theMain Section which is filled with all kinds of things autopsy table stereo computer etc
Click on the secondOil or Gas Canon your right to go to the end of the Empty Section ButBE CAREFUL There is a trap set up ahead
Note Again don't worry even if you walk into this trap It will not be Game Over nor will you get a Countdown clock A cutscene will show Victoria back outside the Computer room and the red aura pulsating around the screen would mean that you would have to go up to the Kitchen use one of the First Aid Kits in its Storage Cabinet to treat her and go back to the Computer Room to neutralize this trap In order to avoid this hassle however proceed as follows
Click on theElectrical quot Power quot Outlet just right of the three Oil or Gas Cans to hear Victoria's comment Click on thewhiteicon on theReflector like the one you picked up earlier in the Living Room just right of the end of the wall to hear Victoria's comment and receive a New Objective Click on theGreen Cylinder with a red light flashing on its left on the ceiling on your right to hear another comment and receive a New Objective again But in fact both of these Objectives are one and the same Apparently the idea was to inform you of the trap when you clicked on either the Reflector or the Cylinder
Neutralizing the quot Basement quot Trap Click on theWhite Baseup on the second pipe on the wall on your left to hear Victoria's comment Place theMULTISPECTRAL LAMPon that Base A cutscene will reveal the trap on your right a web ofYellow Laser Beamsstretched beyond the entryway to the Main Section of the room Victoria will move close to that web and comment Click on the magnifying glass icon on the web on your right to get an aerial view of the trap
WARNING DONOTTRY TO DO ANYTHING WHILE YOU ARE IN THIS CLOSE UP
The close up is no doubt useful in getting the quot aerial quot view of the trap but if you startdoing thingswhile you are in this close up aTECHNICAL BUGwill prevent you from accessing the area on your rightunlessyou are in this close up even if you step out of the close up the magnifying glass icon will cover the entire area on your right thus becoming your only means of accessing that area The problem arises from the fact that the close up will also quot freeze quot Victoria at her starting position before the Web She will take theinitialsteps of solving this puzzle without leaving her position But the last steps of the solutionrequireher to move So her inability to move will prevent you from finishing the puzzle and thus the game itself
Stepout of the close upon the Web on your right Click on theElectrical Outleton your left to hear Victoria's comment Plug yourLASER TRANSMITTERinto this Outlet
A web ofRed Laser Beamswill now appear along the Yellow Beams on your right Note that the dangerous magnifying glass icon on the Web has also now disappeared Moreover now that Victoria is aware of the trapandcan see how it is laid out she will not for the most part of the puzzle go through any beams that are not safe to cross Thus you can now move through the Web relatively safely
Click on thewhiteicon in the area around the Laser Transmitter you just plugged in to hear Victoria's comment Click inside the Web on your right to move Victoria into the Main Section of the room and get an aerial view of the trap without being in a close up
Note Refer to the following picture as you read the instructions below But please do not be confused to see Victoria appear intwoplaces in this picture I have combined two pictures of course to give you an overall layout of the trap so you would be able to see all the points of the room you must visit to neutralize this trap
Click on theLaser Transmitter quot A quot in the above picture to learn that it can turn degrees Click on the Transmitter again to turn it

Click on theDevice with the Red Blinking Light quot E quot in the above picture to hear Victoria's comment Click on that Device again to turn it off
A cutscene will follow ending with the disappearance of the Web of Laser Beams around the room We have neutralized the trap in the Computer Room
There is not much of the house left to explore in search of something new or that might prove to be useful later So let's finish that exploration before attending to our Main Objective of trying our luck on the computer
You won't find anything else new in the Computer Room So go to the door under the Red Bulb left of the large Blue Cupboard Enter what the developers call the quot Basement quot but what I called the quot Underground quot in order to distinguish this area from the non secretive parts of the Basement the Workshop and the Computer Room In fact you can think of the following area as thesecretpart of the Basement
The Secret Part of the Basement The Locker Hallway The only thing new here is that Victoria can now open theGray Locker but there is nothing in this Locker
The Electric Chair Room There is nothing new here except that there aretwowhiteicons one above the other now on the door marked quot Paloma quot and the one at the bottom prompts Victoria to make a new comment
The Cell The only thing new here is a littleYellow quot Sticky quot Noteon the small mirror above the washbasin Click on this Note to hear Victoria's comment but we will not get a close up or otherwise learn what the note said

Conversation with Karson The length of the conversation does not seem to actually affect the storyline But you can certainly gain the maximum possible information from Karson if you stretch the conversation the longest by addressing the topics in the following order
Toughen the Tone Calm things down Karson's Torture Gary Anderson Registrar's File Make the Killer Talk A cutscene will follow providing Paloma with a New Objective as the story switches to her point of view
Paloma A Few Minutes Earlier Note It's funny because even though we just got a New Objective we cannot check it during the sequence that follows when it really counts If you are curious to know however and as you can later check for yourself the objective was to quot Remove the chains to escape quot The Countdown clock is running but don't worry As usual we have more than enough time to beat the clock Here is the situation Paloma is bound to the chair by a chain around her waist and the chain apparently has a lock on it TheKeyto that lock is on the small table on your left that was shown in the cutscene we just saw If you try to go and pick up that Key now however Paloma will approach it only to tell you that she can't reach the Key because her hands are tied You must therefore first free her hands by using theCircular Sawon your right ButWatch Outfor theWood Chipson the floor around the left part of the Saw Table If Paloma moves into that rubble she will not be able to go directly towards the Saw You would have to bring her down and then try to go to the Saw again losing some time in this struggle Here is the quickest way to get through this rather short sequence
Move Paloma towards the rightin a straight line stopping just under the Saw and then move her up towards the Saw in a straight line again See the path marked by theRed Linein the picture below
Don't click on thewhiteicon that appears on the Saw because that means you are still too far away from the Saw to use it Click on thegearicon when it appears on the Saw A cutscene will follow

Exhaust the conversation butBeware The conversation ends as soon as you bring up the topic of the quot Gun Bullet quot So save that topic for last if you would also like to discuss the other topics At the end of the conversation you will get another New Objective notification But if you check your objectives you will find that there is really no quot new quot objective

We need to go to the Shelter The Hatch in the Backyard is closed and cannot be opened from the Computer in the Computer Room We must therefore go to the Workshop and use the Blue Door there to get into the Shelter So go to the Workshop A cutscene will be followed by a dialog that will be followed by yet another cutscene that will take you back to

Glass Room Saving Paloma A cutscene and a dialog will follow Paloma will comment and the Countdown clock begins to run But don't worry You have more than enough time to beat the clock if you have collected all the items from the Office that I indicated in this walkthrough
Note When I first played this game I was concerned by Hawker's remarks about quot No Second Chances quot and that if this were a video game he would program it so that we would not be able to try again It sounded as if I would not be able to save the game after the Countdown clock began this time even though I had been able to do so in the previous timed sequences However I did not have any problems saving my game this time either But then a few days ago as I was about to get to this sequence again playing the game asecondtime to write this walkthrough I happened to see a walkthrough in which the writer claimed that youcouldn'tsave the game this time referring to Hawker's above remarks as reasons for not being able to do so The person sounded so serious I played this sequenceseveraltimes to see if I had the same problem But I was able to save every single time In short I haveno ideawhat that writer was talking about But I thought it best to still ask you to save your gamebeforeentering this room just in case you experience the same problem that that writer did

Solved by Lone Linesver Note for Dreamcast players This walkthrough was written while playing the PC version of the game
There are some differences between the Dreamcast version and the PC version
Unfortunately I do not own a Dreamcast so I cannot help you beyond this walkthrough
Fixes from ver Added Note for Dreamcast players redid the infamous get the can of chili out of thin air magic trick polished up some descriptions of actions removed a part that got Dreamcast players killed I've been expecting this one all year and I must say I was a bit on the dissapointed side
The game was very short and seemed to have more cut scenes than actual gameplay value though the cut scenes are great there really should have been more meat in it
A few notes about this walkthrough This solution contains all the actions that are needed to complete the game nothing more
I STRONGLY recommend to explore on your own and try solving everything yourself and only consult this file when stuck in the game

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
Subject walkthrough by Jenny Menu and Game Options When you first start the game a window pops up that allows you to choose Screen Resolution Graphics Quality and Select Monitor
By default my settings were set very low at x and quot Fastest quot despite that my video card was able to support much better
There is also a checkbox in case you want to play the game windowed which might be necessary for those with low end video
Once you're satisfied with your Graphics configuration click the Play button to start the game
The game should quot remember quot your chosen settings for your next playing session though it will display the window every time you start the game
At the menu select your Profile and quot New Experience quot to start or restart the game
There is no manual save and you click quot Continue the Experience quot to pick up where you left off last playing session
There are three separate profiles that you can play under
The Options selection in the Main Menu has separate volume settings for Sound Effects and Music has a slidebar for Quality I assume graphics quality and allows you to choose your language English Spanish French Italian German
During gameplay there are three icons in the upper right of the screen
The top one will get you back to the main menu allow you to restart allow you to adjust options useful if the music is too loud as it was on my computer allow you to exit the game or allow you to continue playing
The middle icon gives you game tips
The lowest icon allows you to read the quot testimonies quot that you discover as you play through the game
These quot testimonies quot which are messages left by people who previously lived on the island will tell you what happened before you came were brought there
Your inventory is in the lower left of the screen where inventory items appear in hexagonal boxes
You can get a close up of an inventory item by right clicking on it
In the close up you can rotate and move the item around usually by right clicking and dragging it occasionally by left clicking
The game is divided into four areas I'll call them chapters I will list the dates on the testimonies I found in the walkthrough however there was some variation on which testimony was found in which location so you may get a testimony with a different date
You may notice that there are a couple of testimonies that appear in different places as compared to the quot List of Testimonies quot I made before writing this walkthrough
Bugs In my experience the game had a tendency to lose inventory or not to spawn it in the first place
Also quot testimonies quot might not appear or might not register as being found if they do appear and you collect them
Other players have also reported losing inventory
The patch was supposed to fix the problem but even after installing the patch I had a testimony not spawn during one playthrough
It's possible to finish the game without all the testimonies but not very satisfying
Testimonies Check theList of Testimonies here
Click quot New Experience quot to start a new game
A car falls down through water
You see a locket with a woman's picture also in the water
You see your character falling down through water then being teleported away in a flash of white light
Chapter The First Room You awaken and a disembodied voice asks how you feel
Choose whichever choice you want as a response the result will be much the same
The first part of the game is a tutorial and you will be given tips on how to navigate
For example right click and drag the mouse to pan around
You are sitting in a chair
Pan down and a bit to the right to see a red button near your right arm
Push the button
A keypad appears
You need a code
Pan left to a small monitor by your left knee
Move your cursor so it turns to a gear over the monitor
Left click and hold your mouse button until a magnifying glass and eye appear
While still holding down your mouse button move your cursor over the eye until the eye gets large and click the eye for a comment
Repeat the process this time selecting the magnifying glass to zoom in
To select the eye or magnifying glass you must click and drag your mouse in such a way that the icon you want increases in size before clicking it Click and drag the slidebar on the monitor to the right to see pictures of the two characters
Decide which character you want to play as the character originally designed for the game on the left or the top contributing backer for the game's Kickstarter on the right
In my game the number for the original character was and the number for the backer was
The game plays the same with either character and the only difference is what he looks like Remember the number of your chosen character and click the X in the upper left of the screen to exit the close up
Pan to the keypad click and hold your left mouse button over the gear icon and choose the magnifying glass to zoom in
Enter the numbers for the character you want
The disembodied voice talks to you
Answer how you want and he opens your way off the chair you're sitting on
Move your cursor in front of you so the exit icon appears it looks like a square with an arrow pointing into it and click to get up out of the chair
Look around the room
You'll find various locations with gear icons that give you the eye look option
It is not necessary to use the eye icon at every opportunity to complete the game but there are times when it will give a clue
There are two quot testimonies quot to find in this room
One is to the right of the beige monitor that is facing you on the right side of the desk
Click and hold gear icons you find around the area to find one that produces the hand icon that allows you to take the testimony
You now have the opportunity to listen to the testimony October
Click the double triangle icon at the bottom of the testimony box to exit the testimony window
You can listen to testimonies again by clicking the bottom icon of the set of three that is always visible in the upper right of the screen
Note the metal stool with something on it just to the left of the big CRT monitor in the front center of the screen
Zoom into the stool and then into the envelope
Click and drag upward to open the envelope as the green arrow suggests
Click and drag upward again to pull the card up
Click and hold the gear icon then use the hand icon to take the card into inventory
Inventory will appear inside hexagonal shapes at the lower left of the screen
The tutorial continues
Your card is in a hexagon in the lower left of your screen
Right click the card to get a close up then right click and drag the card to flip it over and see a key
Take the key click and hold the gear icon so the hand icon appears and use the hand to take it
Exit the close up of the card using the X in the upper left corner of your screen then exit to the view of the stool by clicking the X again
Now pan down and to the right to see a yellow thing on the floor cell phone
PDA
Click and hold on it and use the hand to pick up a second testimony September
Click the double triangle icon at the bottom of the testimony window to exit the testimony then click the X to get back to the room view
Slightly to the right of center screen is a door you can zoom in on
Zoom in again on the lock to the right off the door to see a floating green arrow pointing out a keyhole
Click and drag the key over the keyhole then drag the key in a counterclockwise circle to simulate turning the key as indicated by the ever helpful green arrow
The disembodied voice congratulates you on your amazing brain power and presents you with a puzzle
This one isn't too difficult
It's sort of reverse tic tac toe and you don't have an opponent blocking you
Visualize either one of the diagonals and click the squares that are not part of that diagonal
If you attempt to leave the room and proceed to Chapter without having found all the testimonies the game will warn you
Chapter The Rest of the Laboratory Building When you move to the next room the disembodied voice will tell you there is good news and bad news
The good news is that you are locked in but quot safe quot The bad news is that the previous inhabitants were brutally massacred
Zoom in on the top of the pillar in the center of the room
Click and drag the vertical bars to the right and left away from center to uncover the rectangular doors in the middle and they open
If they don't open try pulling the vertical bars a little further over
A yellow box rises up through the doors
Right click and drag the screen to rotate the box until you find a lighted square
Click and drag the square downwards to reveal a red button
Push the button
The upper part of the yellow box lifts up and flips over
Right click and drag the screen around so you can look down into the box
It looks like a three handled wheel
Take the wheel the game calls it a handset and discover a testimony April
Back out to the room view
At the far left of the screen is a large green box that your character will identify as a large metal container if you use the eye
Zoom in on the container and then zoom again into the area in the lower center of the container
Drag the square with the hexagon symbol on it upwards then drag the lower part down oven door style to reveal a puzzle
Zoom in
The object is to get all the symbols three in a row
The rows can be in any direction across or down
When a set of three is created it lights up
This is easier than a normal slider so give it a shot
When you're finished the metal container opens to reveal a ball
Grab and pull the left and right sides of the ball downward to reveal a forklike object
You can right click and pan your screen to get a better look
Your character identifies it as a lever
Take the lever
Before zooming out notice a yellow object behind the right side of the green box
You may have to orient your view to be looking down on the box in order to see the yellow testimony Memo
Pick it up
Zoom back out to room view
Then zoom into the closet on the right side of the room
Drag the handset three handled wheel to the middle of the closet
Once the handset is attached grab one of the handles and turn it counterclockwise until the closet opens
Push the button on top of the cabinet inside the closet and the shelves rotate revealing a puzzle
Note that the shelves have colors on them and the sides of the closet also have thin strips of color
Click and drag the shelves so the color on the shelf matches the color on the cabinet
Once that's done the cabinet at the bottom of the closet pops open and reveals a book
You automatically zoom down toward the book
If you examine it with the eye icon your character somehow realizes it is a book of spells
Pick up the book so it is in inventory then right click the book for a close up
Right click and drag the book around to examine it
It has a combination lock on the front
Rotate the book so you're looking at its spine and the front of the book is on top
Zoom into the right side of the spine
If you use the eye it will give a clue
Click and drag the right end of the spine so it opens out like an oven door
You'll see a symbol inside that vaguely resembles the number
Copy or memorize it
Zoom out to book view
In general you right click and drag objects in inventory when you want to move the whole object and left click or left click and drag when you want to move only a part of that object
Raise the spine so you're looking at the back of the book
There's an interactive spot on one of the corners near the edge opposite the spine
If you use the eye icon you get the comment quot This room looks different than the others quot Huh
Room
Never mind that
Zoom in on it then drag the square area downwards

Three legged chair
Copy or memorize this symbol too
Zoom out to the view of the entire book and drag the book around so you're looking at the front of it
Zoom in on the lock
Click and drag the symbols so the ones you found are facing the red marks
Now drag the red switch in the middle the one with the triangle on it downward
If it doesn't work try reversing the order of the symbols
Both wheels of the lock include both symbols
In my game the three legged chair symbol went on the left and the number symbol went on the right
When finished you can drag the tab that's holding the book down left click and drag then right click and drag the book to orient it then left click and drag the book open
On the first page of the book the number quot quot is upside down
Left click and drag the number counterclockwise to turn it over
The book automatically closes and the spine falls open
Right click and drag your view of the book around to see what was under the spine Number puzzle

Take the socket wrench and the testimony September
This socket wrench is your good friend who will assist you several times in the game
Back out times to the room view then zoom in on the command box next to the second door from the right
See a yellow arrow pointing down
If you try dragging the yellow arrow downward it won't move
But look close and you'll see lug nuts at the top corners
Use your socket wrench to unscrew the lug nuts
First drag the socket wrench over to the lug nut then drag it counterclockwise to unscrew the nut
Repeat with the other lug nut
Finally drag the yellow arrow downward and see three vertical slots
You need to insert that forklike object you found earlier the one the game calls a lever
However it won't fit right now
Zoom in on the lever and see the tines are twisted
Click and drag the twisted tines to straighten them out
Now try dragging the fork lever to the vertical slots and they fit this time
Pull the switch down and a door opens
Go through the door and see a woman who disappears
A ghost
A hologram
The disembodied voice tells you you're mistaken about seeing her
Go up the stairs at the right of the screen to reach a room with two bunk beds
Zoom into the cabinet between the two bunk beds
It's a little tricky but it's possible to open both doors of the cabinet
Pull open the doors of the boxes on the top shelves then pan downward so you can look down at what is in the boxes
The left box contains a testimony Report from October
The box on the right contains a broken cement block
Move the broken cement block backwards until you see the object underneath
Use the eye on the object and see it's a swipe card
Take the swipe card
Drag the screen around until you see the helmet on the right side of the top of the cabinet
Pick up the helmet and automatically get a testimony November
Zoom out to the room view
Zoom into the sink area at the back of the room
Pick up the testimony November on the sink
Push the button to try to turn the water on
No water
Pan down and zoom into the pipes at the lower right of the sink to find a valve
Turn the valve to turn on the water
Now the sink works
Fill the sink with water then use the helmet on the water to get a helmetful
Exit left downstairs to the previous room
There are three sets of doors at the back of the room
Look at click on gear icon then eye icon the leftmost set doors
Your character says it's used to store tools

Is that a ladder
Zoom into the lock
It's a puzzle
The object is to get the hexagon on the blue piece under the cut out hexagon
You can slide the pieces up and down or side to side regardless of the shape of the pieces
Try it yourself but for a step by step Blue piece down Red piece down Uppermost red piece all the way to right Vertical red piece up Blue piece all the way to left
Once the puzzle is done drag your swipe card to the slot on the lock and the door will open
Take the ladder and get a testimony September
Zoom out
If you try the ladder on the set of doors at the right to try to get to the upper floor it doesn't work
Examine the ladder to find out why right click it
It's not long enough
Use the socket wrench on the lug nut then grab the wrench and move it counterclockwise to loosen the nut
Flip the striped clamp to the right then grab the rungs of the ladder and move them all the way up to extend the ladder
Exit the close up of the ladder and drag the ladder over the rightmost set of doors and this time you can place the ladder
Climb the ladder use the zoom icon
Now you see a green box
If you use the eye icon to examine the box you see a testimony next to the box
Use the hand icon to get the testimony Memo
Zoom in on the puzzle lock on top of the box
It's another of those puzzles where you have to get the hexagon under the hexagonal opening
Vertical block up Red block right Blue block down to bottom Both vertical blocks all the way left Red block up to the top Blue block right and up Zoom into the quot weird object with weird energy quot artifact then pick it up and zoom out twice to the room view
At the right side of the room is something your character identifies as a metal closet
After you zoom in and look at the pipes he'll say it's a cooling system
Pan down and to the left of the cooling system and pick up a testimony Report from February
Pan back to view the machine
There's a drawer to the left of the red button
Pull the drawer and it tilts out
Dump your helmet full of water into the drawer
The gauge fills up with water and a puzzle appears on the right
Do the puzzle and doors pop open
Two red blocks left Blue block all the way down Vertical red block right Blue block down one square and to right Move the three horizontal red blocks on the left side to the right Move the upper three horizontal red blocks to the left Blue block up left up Take the artifact and right click on it for a close up
Grab the other artifact that you have in inventory and see one over the other
Left click and grab the top half of the artifact to rotate it so the two artifacts will fit together then pull the top one down onto the bottom one to get a cube shaped object
Zoom out of the metal closet and exit the room to the left to get to the room with the red light and the column in the center
Zoom into the object under the red light twice and drag the cube into the square hole
A big door opens
Enter the new room
There's that woman again over on the left side of the room
Get a close up of the console area where she's working and wait for her to talk with you
She looks like your former love interest who met a violent and untimely end
She tells you to be careful but her voice breaks up and she disappears before she can tell you anything specific
The disembodied voice now believes you
Interestingly he says he once knew someone named Sophie in another life
Zoom in on one of the switches at the back of the console
You want all the gauges to be red
Flip switches and
Another puzzle appears
Zoom in on the puzzle
You want all the squares to be lit up
The starting arrangement for this puzzle is random so I can't provide a solution
The game automatically backs you out of the console when the puzzle is solved
You see a beam of light
Zoom back into the console
Then zoom in again using the gear icon at the right of the console near the green buttons
Your view is moved to the right end of the console where you see a glowing blue cube
Take the cube and you automatically get a testimony Report from February
Learn about the Hunapu god quot Ah Cizin quot who quot bears absolute knowledge and serenity but who is also a great devourer of souls quot Zoom out twice to the room view
Put your blue cube in the square framework at the very front of your screen and at the center
You'll see the cube slowly spin around
There is another testimony March which you may have to pan downward in order to see
It's over toward the left side of the room hiding behind the hose
Consider what to do with the bright beam of light
You need to reflect it around so it hits the cube
Raise the reflector right of the door with the hexagon design at the back of the room so the light beam is hitting it
Grab the ring at the the bottom of the reflector stand to turn the reflector and adjust the reflector head so the light hits the reflector on the left
Adjust the second reflector so it aims the light at the third reflector then adjust the third reflector so the light hits the blue cube
The blue cube shines a light into an object your character thinks resembles a projector
Zoom in on the projector
Use your socket wrench to unscrew the lug nut then pull the door outward
Pick up the yellow testimony Memo
See the pattern projected on the wall
If you look inside the projector before shining the light through the blue cube that area will all be dark
Your goal for the puzzle is to neaten up the hexagonal design on the wall so white areas are all neatly within black areas without overlaps
You do this by turning the three gears on the left
The leftmost gear moves all the lighted areas
The middle gear moves two of them
The rightmost gear moves one
Notice the gap in the outer hexagon of light
You want that gap near the bottom slightly to the left of center
Adjust the gap's location using the leftmost gear
You can adjust the rightmost gear to see what will need to be rotated by the second gear
The second gear is the tricky one
With leftmost and rightmost gears in position you'll see which light will need to be adjusted by the second gear and have a better idea how far to turn it
Once you adjust the second gear you'll have to redo the rightmost gear
Have another conversation with the disembodied voice
Then go through the door in the back of the room that has been opened up by solving the projection puzzle
Chapter Outdoors Pick up the testimony Report from October that's in the grass to the right of the big rock at the left front of your screen

Then left click don't drag the top of the jar until your character says it should be OK
The jar automatically turns right side up
Now you can unscrew the lid left click and drag counterclockwise or from left to right
Who knew that your inventory had such a rock solid bottom that you could bang a jar on it
Zoom out of the close up
Zoom into the area where you see the light green and brown plant
The pitcher plant puzzle is one of those where you have to click on things in a certain order and you must solve it by trial and error
When you manage to open all the small pitcuers the large pitcher will open
The solution to the puzzle is random
Unless you are very good at visualizing where all the pitchers are I suggest getting a piece of paper and making a chart of where the smaller pitchers are in relation to the large pitcher
Note that some pitchers are high and some are low and it will help you keep track
Click the smaller pitchers until you find one that stays open then mark it on your chart
Try clicking another pitcher and if it's the correct one both will stay open
If not you have to start the sequence over
You'll have to right click and drag the pitcher plant to get to the pitchers on the other side
Once the puzzle is finished and the big pitcher is open drag your jar on it to collect the liquid
Zoom out
There is a path between the pitcher plant and the path to the bear
Take that path and see a hot pepper plant behind some thorny brambles
Pan left and see a roundish rock on top of a flat rock

Right click the pink vanity case in inventory and zoom in on the lock
Click and drag the numbers to enter
Your character says it's the right code
Zoom out and pull down the clasp
Raise the lid
You may have to turn the vanity case to the side to get the lid up far enough that it's out of the way of the puzzle
Zoom in on the puzzle
Here is one solution Note Skipped lines are only to help you keep track of where you are in the sequence
You may want to sketch the starting configuration in case you decide to use my solution and then lose track
For whatever reason I found it much easier to return to the starting configuration than to figure out where I went off track ndash or continue to a different solution
Yellow piece to the right White piece in lower right corner left up up up to top Yellow piece right and up Pink piece all the way to the right Yellow piece all the way down White piece left and down Pink piece on top all the way to the right Blue piece up Yellow piece all the way left White piece down one square and left one square Pink piece on bottom all the way left Two yellow pieces down White piece right up and all the way right Yellow piece up and left White piece left Yellow piece up Pink piece all the way right Yellow piece down and left Pink piece left Yellow piece down White piece right Pink piece all the way up below the other pink piece Yellow piece all the way left White piece all the way down and left Other White piece all the way down Pink piece right and down Other Pink piece right Blue piece right Yellow piece all the way up Yellow piece left Other Yellow piece left White piece left and up Other White piece all the way left Pink piece down Other pink piece all the way down on top of other pink piece Blue piece all the way right Yellow piece all the way right Yellow piece up Other Yellow piece up Top White piece all the way left Top pink piece all the way left Blue piece down Pick up the perfume bottle from inside the vanity case
You may have to right click the case and move it to get at the perfume bottle

Right click your shelf fungus in inventory
If you used the eye icon to examine it you know it's flammable
Use your jar of pitcher plant juice on it and the jar will go over on the right side of the screen
Drag the jar over the fungus again and it will act as a lens igniting the fungus
Zoom out and use the burning fungus on the thorny brambles
After the flames have subsided pick up some hot peppers
If you get a message indicating that the thorns are in the way try adjusting your view so you have a clear path to the peppers
Examine your perfume bottle in inventory
Left click the lid and lift it straight up
Drag the hot peppers onto the bottle and get homemade hot pepper spray
Walk up the path to the bear and watch your character automatically spray the bear so it runs away
You are now in a beach house area
The disembodied voice starts another conversation with you but there is interference and you lose contact
Pan right and look in the trees to the right of the rightmost cabin
You'll see a gear icon over what your character identifies as a column of stones
Zoom in on it
The object of the puzzle is to rotate the column pieces so most of the lines between the pieces meet
With some pieces not all of the lines match up
Left clicking and dragging a piece will drag all pieces above it so start solving the puzzle at the top
The lines of the top piece do match the lines on the second piece from the top
All but one of the lines on the second piece match with lines on the third piece
After that you'll have to experiment a little to find the closest fit
When the puzzle is solved the top half of the column lifts up
Move your cursor to the left side of the core of the column next to the top of the fourth piece from the bottom
You may see a gear elsewhere but only the one in the specific location will offer the hand icon
Once you found the right spot pick up the invisible flashlight at least it's invisible on my computer and automatically get another testimony April
Learn about Tau energy
Zoom out
Enter the door of the rightmost cabin
What a mess
Looks like a hidden object scene in here
Fortunately it isn't
On the right side of the screen there is a picture frame on the floor which is leaning on a crate
Left click the picture frame and it automatically flips over
Take the copper wire from the back of the frame using the gear icon and hand icon
Pan left and pick up a testimony from under the safe Report from March
Pan upward and see an altar with a Buddha on the wall to the left of the left window
Zoom in on the altar and zoom in again on the symbols on the bottom of the altar
Rotate the wheels so the symbol on a wheel matches the nearest symbol on the adjacent wheel horizontally and vertically not diagonally
In my game the final arrangement had the top middle wheel with the backwards on top the three legged chair on the left and the symbol that looked like quot ls quot on the bottom
If your game is different try working on four adjacent wheels and find a position where they all match up then see if the rest of the wheels can be turned so they match those four
When the puzzle is solved correctly your view will automatically pull back
Pick up the object to the right of the Buddha it's a burned down candle and automatically get a testimony July
Back out of the cabin
Now go to the middle cabin
It's dark
Right click your flashlight in inventory the game calls it a lamp
Drag the red button toward the front of the flashlight to turn it on
Close the close up and you'll see your flashlight is automatically lighting the room
Pan left from the trunk and see an old organ
Zoom in on the organ and arrange the pipes so the white tops of the pipes are even with the bottom of the embossed gold band on the organ
It is possible to move the pipes without zooming into the organ but if you do that you may miss the animation when you complete the puzzle
When the puzzle is solved pan down and pick up the testimony Report from August
There is a crank attached to the right side of the organ
Move your cursor around to find the gear icon near the right side of the organ and zoom in
Your view shifts to a better view of the gear handle
Grab the handle and turn it clockwise to play the organ
If you do it right your view will swing around to reveal a secret compartment has opened in the organ
Pick up the brown folder and the Boolean key
Don't zoom out of the organ before you get the Boolean key or you may never see it again I don't know if the patch fixed this
Once you have the Boolean key back out of the organ and zoom in on the trunk
Zoom in on the lock on the trunk and notice that you can drag the three pieces
Right click the Boolean key in inventory
In the close up view drag the key so the end with the ring is away from you and you get a good view of the business end of the key
In my game the skinny slot was on the bottom the fat slot was on upper left and the medium slot was on upper right
You need to adjust the trunk lock so it will fit the key
Close the close up and examine the lock
Since this arrangement will be a mirror image of the arrangement on the key drag the medium size prong to the upper left and the fat prong to the upper right
The skinny prong will still go on the bottom
Then drag the Boolean key over the trunk lock
If lined up correctly your character will tell you
Grab the key and turn it counterclockwise until the trunk lid pops open
Right click and drag your view until you're looking inside the trunk
Pick up the fishing rod
Back out of the cabin

Note the joke about cake earlier in the message
The cake is a lie
Pan downward until you find the ruined boat
Zoom in on it and zoom in again to see the right side of the boat
Pick up the case that's lying on the ground and automatically get a testimony Memo
Zoom out once and pan so you get a view of the net hanging left of the boat
Zoom in on the needle that's in the net and pick it up
Zoom out to the view of the beach
Despite that we don't have a boat we're going to make a compass like the guy who wrote the paper wanted to
Zoom in on the case that was next to the boat
Click it to find the zipper is stuck
Drag your candle onto the case to lubricate the zippers
Pull the zippers right and left from center to open the case
Pick up the rusty old knife
Get a close up of your soda can and push in the top to open it
Get a close up of your knife and drag the soda can over it

Zoom in on the pail of water then drag the cork and needle assemblage onto the water in the bucket
Now you have a compass
Pan upward and drag your fishing rod over the ocean in the direction the compass says is north
An anchor will magically appear on the end of your fishing rod
Pick up the anchor
The anchor will dance around so it may take more than one try to grab it
In different playthroughs the compass would point in slightly different directions sometimes straight out from the pier sometimes toward the large island sometimes toward the small island
So there is a purpose in making the compass even if you never find a usable boat
Leave the close up view of the end of the pier and head towards the shore
The woman Sophie from an alternate dimension to your own appears in the center of the pier and talks to you before she disappears again Continue to the shore panning left when necessary
Take the path between the rightmost cabin and the middle cabin to reach a cliff area with a broken rope bridge
Pan downward to find another testimony Memo partially covered by a large rectangular rock
Pan back upwards and drag the anchor over the broken bridge
The anchor magically sprouts a rope and zips across the chasm to embed itself in the remnants of the bridge on the other side
The disembodied voice returns again suggesting he'll meet you in the temple
Cross the bridge to the temple area
Chapter Temple You're outside the temple but the door is closed
Zoom in on the monkey statue in the middle of the courtyard
There are statues of the three wise monkeys See No Evil Hear No Evil and Speak No Evil and a Mayan king
Right click and drag the base the statues are on to find another testimony January
Note there is a gold plaque here
Zoom back out
Move your cursor to the right of the stairway to the temple to locate the gear icon
Zoom in to see a carved stone square
Zoom into the square then drag it downward to find another in a row puzzle
When you solve it your view automatically swings around to show a different stone carving which opens to reveal a crystal sphere the game refers to as an quot eye quot When you take the eye you automatically get another testimony November
Back out and you're facing the original square stone
Pan right to find another testimony October
Zoom in on the gold plaque near where the last testimony was
It has an ear on it
Drag the crystal ball over the plaque to see a Mayan number in red
Remember the three monkeys
There are golden plaques to be found around the courtyard some with an ear some with an eye some with a mouth
Whenever you find one drag the crystal ball over it to get the Mayan number
Write down all the Mayan numbers and whether they were associated with an eye an ear or a mouth
Review the information in the brown folder to understand how to convert Mayan numbers to numbers and vice versa
A dot in the lower zone
A line in the lower zone
A dot in the upper zone A line in the upper zone x Ear plaque I just described Mayan Back up and pan down to see a plaque with an eye on the stone and a mouth plaque on the steps to the left
Drag the crystal ball over the plaques to get the Mayan numbers associated with them
Eye plaque Mayan Mouth plaque Mayan Zoom out to the view of the entire courtyard then zoom into the eye just left of the bush at right front of the screen
Use the crystal
Eye plaque Mayan Zoom into the monkey statue to get a better look at the plaque near where you picked up the testimony
Use the crystal
Mouth plaque Mayan Zoom back out and zoom into the above ground tomb to the left of the monkey statue
Move the vase to the left to see an eye plaque
There is a mouth plaque on the wall to the left and an ear icon hiding under some leaves near the top of the screen just left of center
Eye plaque Mayan Mouth plaque Mayan or Ear plaque Mayan Notice the carving of the king on top of the tomb is holding a sort of bowl
Put the crystal sphere in the bowl and a blue line lights up with a green square at one end
Drag the green square along the blue line until you get it to the other end
The top of the tomb lifts up
Pan down so you can see inside and take the metal object crank handle that is with the king's remains
You automatically get a testimony October
Pick up your crystal ball and back out of the close up
You need to add the Mayan numbers associated with the plaques and input them into the statues using the metal object crank handle you found in the tomb
Eye Ear Mouth You'll have to translate these numbers back to Mayan
Zoom in on the monkey statue then on the See No Evil monkey
You can see his belly has a sort of keyhole
Right click the metal object that you took from the tomb that is in inventory the crank handle
There are two dials on it
The upper dial corresponds to the upper zone of the Mayan number the lower dial corresponds to the lower zone
For the Eye x so we want a in the top zone and a in the bottom zone
In other words three lines and one dot on top and one line and dots on the bottom
Notice the crank handle only has Mayan numbers etc
on it
That's OK because you can point between the and to get or between the and to get etc
Move the upper smaller arrow to point between the three lines and a dot and the three lines and three dots
Move the lower larger arrow to point between the line and dots and the lines
Exit the close up of the crank then drag the crank over the monkey's belly
Turn the crank clockwise and the monkey statue will rise
For the Ear x so we want a single dot in the top zone and three lines and three dots in the bottom zone
Zoom in on the crank and place the small arrow to the left of the two dots and the large arrow on the three lines and three dots
Exit the close up drag the crank on the monkey's belly and turn the crank clockwise
The second monkey statue rises
For the Mouth x se we want a in the top zone and a in the bottom zone
Get a close up of the crank
Place the small arrow between the one line and one dot and the one line and three dots
Place the large arrow between the two dots and the four dots
Insert the crank in the monkey's belly and turn the crank
The third monkey statue rises then the statue of the king turns around to face the door of the temple and the door to the temple opens
The woman Sophie appears at the entrance to the temple
She wants you to find her husband
Enter the temple
Before you do anything else pick up the last testimony from the right front of the screen partially hidden behind one of the stone spokes on the floor November
Zoom in on the black and white block sculpture in the center of the room
Right click and drag the sculpture to rotate it
There is a hard to see gray button on the gray base of one of the four sides directly in the middle
There are also pink green and yellow squares on the upper part whick are active areas
You must left click these four active areas in the proper sequence to solve the puzzle
Each time you click correctly part of the black and white area will raise
Click the active areas out of sequence and the puzzle will reset so you have to start over
I don't know if this puzzle is random
The last time I did the puzzle the sequence was gray button pink square yellow square green square
When the puzzle is correctly complete pan to look down on the cubical base and drag the crystal sphere to the top of it
Now for the evil cylindrical Minesweeper
A single dot in a blue square means a single mine in one of the surrounding squares
Two dots means two of the surrounding squares contain a mines
Three dots three mines etc
A quick left click marks a square blue
To mark a square as a mine left click and hold until the square turns green
If you make a mistake you are ejected from the puzzle and your mistake is marked red while your blue squares are unmarked
Taking the crystal ball and putting it back on the stand allows you to continue the puzzle
Green and red squares will remain but your blue squares will all be gone
I always changed red squares to be green because I have this thing about correcting mistakes but I don't think it's necessary to complete the puzzle
Once all squares are correctly filled in blue green or red the cylinder should start spinning around and the game will continue
If it doesn't you've either missed filling in a square somewhere easy to do with this hard to look at puzzle or you've marked a square green when it should have been blue
Once you've finished the Minesweeper the disembodied voice talks to you and things are pretty much automatic from here
It doesn't matter which conversation choice you make
The dialogue is slightly different but the result is the same
Sophie will try to rescue you
Click on the lighted area to enter it
Watch what happens to your character and then to Subject a version of yourself from yet another dimension
Discussion ndash Great honkin' spoilers So which is the correct choice
For your character who had never gotten over losing his love interest Sophie years ago relief from heartache seemed the correct one
For some of the quot Subjects quot from alternate dimensions achieving a form of enlightenment and nirvana by joining with Ah Cizin seemed correct
Remember the Buddha in the altar on the wall that you saw in one of the cabins
But at least one quot Subject quot wanted to continue living in the real world with his Sophie
And choosing to unite with quot Ah Cizin quot would have been more attractive if he hadn't mentioned almost dying and having to quot fuse quot with every member of the tribe that had once inhabited the island in order to survive
Ah Cizin may indeed fuse his consciousness with those he absorbs
At one point he says he remembers knowing a quot Sophie quot from a long time ago and he seems genuinely sorry for your character's loss
But that doesn't mean all those people he quot fused quot with are alive inside Ah Cizin only that he now has their memories and possibly a trace of their compassion
And what exactly happened to your character at the end
At first glance it appeared that Sophie disrupted Ah Cizin's absorption process by giving him a body he wasn't expecting so both she and later your character ended up underwater in your character's dimension near where he almost drowned
But if the Sophie you see in the game is just a hologram how would that work
Or did she somehow manage to finally teleport her physical self onto Ah Cizin's island
Or is everything you see of Sophie dragging your character to the surface of the water all something going on inside Ah Cizin's mind where both Sophie and your character can be together
If that's the case it isn't the enlightenment and freedom from emotion that Ah Cizin promised
If Ah Cizin wants to fuse with smart people he shouldn't have any objection to joining with Sophie who was smart enough to find a way through dimensions to Ah Cizin's island to find her universe's version of Franklin
We have to assume Ah Cizin has no aversion to fusing with females because it's unlikely that every member of the island's tribe was male
The last scene you see is Subject and his Sophie running away
Was Ah Cizin attempting to fuse with Dimension 's version of both of them
ndash something that didn't appeal to either of them because they were quite satisfied with living in the real world together

SUBJECT List of Testimony Locations By Jenny Note After replaying the game numerous times I have occasionally had one or two testimonies show up with different dates than the ones indicated including two testimonies with the same date showing up in two different locations
This is a glitch but it's not important as long as you are able to find all the testimonies
Unfortunately even after applying patch I had a testimony not show up at all the one under the safe and had to replay
I could understand that if I'd tried to replay from a previous save but I'd started a new game So there may be issues even after patching the game
In general though the patch seems to have helped with the disappearing inventory bug
Perhaps it would be helpful if after you patch the game you go into the game's save location at C Users your username AppData LocalLow Microids Subject and manually delete all pre patch saved games just to be sure all previous unpatched save information and mis information is gone

Take the Voralberg key from your inventory and use it on the aperture in the top hat
The bars of the tomb will descend
Enter Hans' tomb
Open the drawer
Take thenewspaperand theValadilenemusic cylinder
Leave the church yard and go back down the hill to the Notary's office again
Stop momentarily at the coat rack in the outer office and pick up thetelescopic keyfrom the umbrella stand to the right of the outer door
C The Voralberg Factory Leave the Notary's office and go on down toward the hotel looking closely for a break in the wall along the right side of the street just before you reach the hotel
There's an iron gate there with two automatons acting as gate keepers
Use the telescopic key and lay it in the outstretched hands of the small automaton at the top of the gate If you haven't already be sure to wind the key on the larger automaton lower down
Then pull the lever to the right
When the gate swings open to reveal a garden area walk down the path to the central fountain
Note There are five paths leading away from the fountain in a circular pattern
The left path from where Kate entered leads to the Voralberg factory machine floor and Anna Voralberg's office

The second path to the left leads to an open warehouse storage area

The third path to the left leads to the Voralberg train station

The fourth path leads to the Voralberg mansion and gardens

The last leg where Kate is now standing leads back to Valadilene
Go down the first path to Kate's left
Enter the Voralberg Automaton Factory
Notice the rusty sign on the covered bridge
Walk immediate screen right inside the factory against the factory's outer wall
At the end of this side wall aisle is a wooden door
Open it and enter the water wheel control area
Go forward and pull the chain hanging from the ceiling to the right of the window
Then go screen left and pull the upright lever beside the pipe laying horizontally along the floor
You'll notice that this action has started the water wheel turning and it engages the apparatus below
You can't do anything more here right now as you've turned on the power so leave the room
Go immediately screen left back to the factory entry area
Go screen left twice in front of the staircase
Kate will briefly answer a phone call from her chatty mother
After the phone call approach the assembly line structure which is straight ahead of Kate
Note the fork lift automaton standing beside it
Activate the fork lift and note carefully the action steps it performs on its work route even though it is empty handed
As the fork lift returns to its station notice in the cutscene a small wooden door behind Kate
When the fork lift automaton stops in its original position go screen right and then back through that door to the automaton workshop
Notice the nearly completed automaton suspended on a mechanized framework above Kate's head
Use the hot spot to go to the back work area and pull the lever midscreen which operates the pulley system to that overhead framework
The automaton is lowered to a sitting position on the work bench
He is obviously already animated but wait a sec he has no lower legs
Go around to stand in front of the automaton and click on him to engage him in conversation
Model XZ is familiarly known as Oscar
He doesn't like cryptic names
Go down the entire conversation list from your notebook
You learn from Oscar that you need to check out Anna Voralberg's office above the machine floor of the factory
Oscar is a train engineer
He needs his legs quite desperately just as soon as you can cause this to happen
The train at the Valadilene Station just may be capable of going all the way to Syberia
You also learn that automatons have a quot soul auxiliary quot that robots do not possess
You will learn later what that means
Kate will tell Oscar that Anna has died and explains what death means
Oscar sees this as an unfortunate detour to the possibility of attaching his legs
He charters Kate to create new legs in the factory but cautions that they must be the correct model without quot functional idiosyncrasies quot Oscar gives you the outsizedOscar's card
You'll have to figure out just what to do with it
Exit the conversation screen and leave the room via the wooden door
Go screen right twice and go up the stairs
Go through the lighted doorway to Kate's left to enter Anna Voralberg's office
Go in behind the desk
Read Anna's unfinished letter to Hans
Take a good look at Hans' train design
When you are finished walk out from the desk to the cabinet against the wall screen right
Click on the book second from the right on the top shelf
The middle shelf will revolve revealing a music box which is playing a sad tune
When the music stops pick up anothermusic cylinder
Put the Valadilene music cylinder from your inventory in the music box the one from Han's tomb
Following the revealing cutscene between Anna and Hans as children remove theHans Anna mechanical toyand it will be added to your inventory
Go screen forward to leave the office
Go screen left to the stairs leading up to a small platform
At the top of the stairs stand in front of the assembly line control panel
Note that the needle in the large upper dial is vibrating which indicates that the factory's power is on
Take out Oscar's card and place it in the slot under the engraved Voralberg name
Move the six levers to the right until you see number three come alive with a red light indicator
Also note that dial number three on the left panel now displays a yellow light
That's all you can do for now
Go back down the stairs and continue on past Anna's office to the main floor of the factory
Go out through the middle screen main entrance and return to the central fountain
Take the next path to Kate's left
Walk on down to the covered warehouse area to see a large gray metal barrel on a platform
Go to the lever on the post back and right of the platform and click on it
An automated crane will appear and rapidly transport the metal barrel through the doorway in the factory wall
Go back to the fountain and return down the second path to the factory
Once inside go left twice and activate the fork lift automaton
The fork lift follows its familiar route and will take the barrel delivered from the outside warehouse out on the floor to the assembly line
Go back to the control panel upstairs on the platform to the left of Anna's office
Verify that the punch card Oscar gave you is in the control panel's center slot
The number three red light is shining on the right side panel
And the yellow light shows in the number three position on the left panel
You're ready to make some legs
Click the lower left lever with the black knob to the light gold color
Then pull the opposite black lever on the right
A new set of legs for Oscar will be produced on the assembly line in a fascinating cutscene
Leave the control panel and return down the stairs to the factory floor
When you get to the floor go screen right over by the first position of the assembly line
Kate should be standing beside the first pillar structure in front of the main entrance doors
Now go screen right to the last row of assembly lines until you can see Oscar's new legs in the receptacle at the end of the line
Pick upOscar's legsin a close up
Exit the view
Take Oscar's the legs back screen twice and screen left twice to the automaton workshop where Oscar is not so patiently waiting
Take the new legs out of your inventory and offer them to Oscar
Oh oh
He just may tell you immediately that you have made the wrong legs
If this happens just go back up the stairs to the control panel and make sure you select the light gold color in the color window
Pull the lever to the right again and when the cutscene ends go back down to the end of the assembly line main floor screen right and get the correct pair of Oscar's legs
When you have the right pair take them to Oscar in the workshop
He will immediately attach them and express his profound gratitude to Kate
Then he's off to find his train
D The Voralberg Mansion Leave the factory
Your work is done here
Return to the central fountain
Skip two paths to your left where the warehouse is and the Train Station and take the fourth path to the Voralberg mansion
When you arrive try the front door
You'll find it locked
You won't ever be able to access this door either so don't take up your precious time trying it again and again
Come back down the steps and go screen right around to the back of the mansion
Try the back door nestled in amidst the thick growth of ivy
Its permanently locked also
Try operating the automaton ladder
Looks like another key is needed
Go screen right and in the next screen go down the garden path screen right toward a vast topiary maze
Talk to the woman working beside the path
She will complain about having to do without automaton help
She will not have anymore to say to you so don't bother with her again either
You may as well go on down the path and take a look at the pond and the statue also but there's no action there
Go through the iron gates behind the kneeling woman
Go forward once
Turn right and enter the open gated niche where you will find a wall fountain
There's a secondVoralberg keyin the fountain's basin
Take it
Exit the screen and go back out and screen forward to the automaton ladder
Use the key from the fountain on the ladder
Climb the ladder to the open window in the attic dormer
Inside go screen left to see an old school room desk and stool
Open the desk to get theink bottleandAnna's diary
Read the diary to learn about Anna's life with Hans his accident the dysfunctional relationship the children had with their father and Hans' eventual escape
Anna decided to stay behind and live out her life in Voralberg with her father
After you've put away the diary explore the attic
In the dark rear corner of the room find an even darker alcove with a hanging light bulb
Click on it and Momo will appear in the outer part of the room
He asks you to draw him a mammoth like Hans' picture
He gives you thepaper and pencilhe is holding
You can talk to Momo about everything
He says he'll tell you a secret if you will just please draw him a mammoth
Kate appears to be at a loss when it comes to producing a drawing for Momo but there is a way to create the drawing
The Mammoth Drawing Go back to the dark alcove where you turned on the light
On the wooden beam screen right there's a small image of a mammoth drawn in what appears to be white chalk
Click on it to get a clear close image
Use your pencil and paper on the close up to develop a tracing of the mammoth image
Exit the screen the alcove and take thepictureback to Momo
The picture is in your personal inventory
Just use the hand icon in the menu bar to access the picture and give to Momo
He tucks it happily away and asks you to follow him
In a cutscene he disappears around the corner of the house moving in the direction of the fountain
Go out the window
Go screen left around to the front of the house
Yeeesh where has Momo gotten off to
Take the path back to the fountain to see Momo dash down the path toward Valadilene's city street
In the street go forward once to see Momo again running up the street toward the Notary's office
Follow him up the street past the Notary's office to the end
You will see Momo waiting in front of another locked gate
He fumbles with a key unlocks the gate and disappears inside
Again follow him
You find yourself on one of several stone bridges over a river
E The Mammoth Cave Cross the bridge and climb the stairs to a shady plaza area
Take the stairs back screen to continue
Walk screen right crossing a log bridge with a rope handrail
In the next screen you'll see a row boat pulled up on the shore
If you click on the board Kate will exclaim that its a shame its full of holes
Continue screen right to find Momo waiting patiently for your arrival
Talk to him about everything appearing in your notebook although some subjects may be repeated
Go up the stairs screen right and try to push the turnstile beside the wooden dam
Kate finds that she is unable to do this alone so go on back down to Momo and address him again with the quot Help quot command from your notebook
He will respond by going up and trying to move the turnstile himself but succeeds only in breaking off one of the spokes
He throws it down angrily and stalks away
Pick up thebroken spoke
Leave the area again
You can ask Momo for help again but he'll just tell you the dam is broken
Go back down the path to the row boat
Try to take the oar laying beside the boat
Kate can't reach it
Use the broken spoke from inventory to pull the oar closer
Kate won't pick it up as its quot all dirty and wet quot Go back up the path and ask Momo for quot Help quot again
He'll come on down to the row boat pick up the oar and carry it off screen right up the path
Ask Momo for quot Help quot again
This time he'll go up push the oar through the pedestal move the turnstile and raise the dam to lower the river
Go back down the stairs
Momo is gone
Take the path back and screen left of where Momo was standing
If you tried this earlier you'll now see that the path across the stream is accessible
Take the path up into the rocks to see the gaping mouth of a very dark cave
Keep going forward to an open area with stalagmites and stalactites
Click on the large stalagmite in the enter screen to move forward and around it
See a dark brown object on the cave floor back screen
Use your magnifying glass to have a closer look
Its themammoth doll Hans' mammoth doll perhaps
Pick up the doll
Leave the cave the way you came in
You'll get a phone call from a work friend Olivia
After a short chat about work and shopping go back down the path toward Valadilen
There's no need to go back up and close the dam again
F The Valadilene Train Station When you arrive back on the main street go down to the break in the right screen wall and go back toward the fountain
Take path number screen back and right not extreme right to the train station
Go on inside and walk screen front
Take the stairs up over and down to the other side of the standing train
Don't bother to go down to the maintenance man who is whistling and sweeping
He won't speak with you ever
Instead come down the stairs screen front to the apparatus with the large wheel on it
Turn the wheel
Pull the lever on the side of the machine in front of Kate
Turn the wheel again to retract the winding mechanism Go back up across the bridge and come down the front side to the platform toward the station's entrance
Click on the train to board it
Click on the compartment door of the passenger car and meet Oscar again
Talk to Oscar using your notebook
When you ask about quot Mission quot you'll find you are going to need a ticket to travel with Oscar
Oscar leaves
Go out behind him to the ticket booth on the platform screen left
Talk to the ticket agent who looks amazingly like Oscar
Ask him about your quot Mission quot again
After some considerable hassle reminiscent of Alice's crazy tea party Oscar relinquishes both aticketand atrain release permit
Get back on the train to get a call from Dan again
He's surly and impatient this time
He wants Kate to come home to accommodate his priorities
Luckily you and Kate have other much higher priorities
Reenter the passenger car and talk to Oscar
Choose quot Mission quot and give Oscar your ticket
He says to keep the ticket
More rules oh gad
You can pursue this by offering Oscar the train release permit only to find it has to be signed by the train's owner or in other words Anna's official representative the Notary
Leave the car and go screen left
Go screen right down the platform and on out to the fountain and the village main street directly screen front
When you are standing in the street go screen left to the Notary's office
Once inside the office click front screen to go forward to the Notary's office door
Click on the door to hear that he is resting
He must be really tired
Use the magnifying glass on the colored levers you see on the secretary's desk behind you
When Kate is repositioned behind the desk click on the top hat of the little automaton holding the stamp with the red top
When the hat opens use your ink bottle to refill the ink supply
Take the train release permit out of your personal inventory and place it on the desk blotter
Push the big red button and after the stamp of approval has been applied by the obliging little automaton pick up theapproved permit
Retrace your steps back to the train by going screen right from outside the Notary's office and back through the gate in the stone wall
At the fountain take path number back screen right to the train station
Go back down the platform to the ticket booth and get on the train at screen right
The ever obedient Oscar awaits you
Take out the Notary approved train release permit and hand it to Oscar
Click on Oscar again after he first responds
Use quot Mission quot from your notebook
Oscar wants the ticket too of course
Give him the ticket
Now he doesn't want the ticket
You must keep it because all the departure requirements have not been fulfilled
Kate must find the three spaces in the luggage compartment for two very important objects
You must place these objects before the train will be completely ready to leave the station
Go screen forward into the display compartment
The pedestal in the center of the room may hold one object and the wooden shelf on the table screen right may hold another
Do you suppose the mammoth doll is likely one of these precious items
Take the mammoth doll out of inventory and try it on the side table shelf there by the bedroom caboose door
Then go back across the room to the pedestal in the center
Put the Hans Anna Mechanical Toy on the pedestal
Use the first cylinder you found in the niche under the top of the pedestal
Then place the Valadilene voice cylinder on the shelf of the left display case behind the pedestal
You have to get the correct cylinder to play in the pedestal so go back to Oscar and use quot Mission quot on him again
Give him your ticket
If you have placed the correct cylinder on the display case shelf and the one in the pedestal you'll be ready to depart in this marvelous train
Note Though the game is set up to humorously confuse you about which cylinder to use you can keep track of where you got them by recording the color on the lip of each cylinder with the place you found it
At this juncture you must see from the music cylinder the cutscene about Hans and Anna at the mammoth cave before you can go back to Oscar and successfully give him the ticket
Then you are off across the countryside on a long scenic journey until you come to a stop at Barrockstadt
Chapter
Barrockstadt The University A The Amerzone Cuckoo Leave the train exiting down the steps screen left
Walk screen right to examine the front of the train
Continue going screen right past the front of the train and descend a set of stairs
Continue screen forward and then screen left past the ruins and down the first path beside the river
You will see a quot winding machine quot atop the city walls that appears to Kate to be like the one back at Valadilene station
Kate remarks that she's got to find some way of quot getting the train up there quot If that sounds totally implausible she really means she needs to move the train forward to the gigantic gates ahead
Go forward to the gates of the city just to take a look around at the surroundings and what potentially might lie ahead for you
Return down the ramp and back to the train
As you walk forward toward the middle of the train Oscar will appear at the entry to the passenger car and ask you to come over
He has some information for you
When Oscar quickly goes back inside follow him into the passenger car
Wonder what could have come up during the short span of time since you left him
Inside Oscar tells you there's a message for you from the Rectors at the University
They want to talk to you
Before you leave talk to Oscar about the quot Mission quot again to learn more about moving the train and the winding machine you saw up on the city wall
Be sure to talk to him about quot Bird quot Leave the train again screen left and go to the bridge with three stairways
Walk up the stairs to screen left and down to the platform
Go screen right and forward until you see a ladder with several birds pecking away at the ground beneath it
The birds get excited and aggressive when Kate gets too close
Its fairly obvious you'll have to find something with which to get rid of them or maybe come back when they are gone
Go back to the bottom of the stairs and forward down the path that leads into the jungle foliage screen left
Keep going forward into a foyer area where you see a gray metal door at the rear of the screen
If you go over and try opening the door you will find that Kate can't enter yet
Instead go back down the path to the bridge and stair area
Go up the stairs again and go straight across and up the other side
Go forward to the platform and go screen left
Walk to the ancient looking service kiosk you see at the left edge of the platform near the river's edge
You'll need a key to operate the kiosk's controls but for now just remember where it is
Go out the doors screen right
Then go screen left around the building
Go screen right up the stairs of the building across the square from the train station
You will pass between two impressively huge mammoth statues and into an enclosed plaza
Click on the small tower structure in the center to approach it
Walk screen left to the doorway opposite where you came across the small bridge
Before you can operate the door mechanism it appears you'll need another object
Possibly something egg shaped
Exit across the bridge again and go toward the stairs between the two sabre toothed tiger statues to the building at the back
You'll see a rude man standing to the left
Talk to him
You only need talk to him once
This young student considers himself to be quite a ladies' man
One encounter with him is quite enough for Kate
Go up the stairs and enter Barrockstadt University
Go screen left two times and enter the second red paneled door straight ahead of you
You find yourself in the presence of the estimable Rectors
Go forward and speak to them
They are short on time and patience and wish to know why the train hasn't yet left the Barrockstadt station
Kate explains the train's winding requirement
The Rectors do not want Kate to go to the city wall
Kate explains she must do this and the Rectors relent and see her trip to the wall as the only way to conform to the city's rules regarding getting the train out of the station as quickly as possible
Ask the Rectors all the questions displayed in the notebook
Kate is admonished to uphold tradition and explains she is not a student
Kate briefly explains her mission
She asks for the Rectors' help to no avail
Kate mentions Hans Voralberg
He did attend the University and appeared to be a bit obsessive about mammoths
They mention Hans' creation of the quot Bandstand
quot Hmmm
The structure in front of the University comes to Kate's mind
When Kate brings up quot Train quot in the conversation the Rectors appear concentrated on just getting rid of it as quickly as possible
Ask about the quot Bird quot s in the train station aviary
The aviary contains a very unique bird species
You'll hear a reference to Alexander Valembois from Microids' earlier adventure game quot Amerzone quot Well the Rectors sure aren't much help are they
So leave them for now and go screen forward outside the door
Go back into the next room with the paneled door and find yourself in the Library
Walk around the mezzanine to screen right
Climb the ladder you see there
Take the book titled quot The Illustrated Dictionary of Plants and Mushrooms quot Read about the Yangala Cola Mushroom which enhances vision
Themushroom guidewill be moved to your inventory
Leave the Library and go screen right twice back to the University's entry foyer
Walk up to the mammoth via the central steps and then click on the stairway center back screen to climb the stairs
Go screen forward to find yourself in the University Auditorium
Click on the stairs leading down into the pit
You'll see a film projector mounted above
Then go up the stairs and around to screen right to find a locked door
This short tour will come in handy later
Leave the Auditorium Don't mind that guy star gazing amidst the seats ever
and come back down the stairs to the foyer area
Go screen right
You'll see an old gentleman checking out a mammoth sculpture
Go speak to him
Ask him all questions in your notebook
He's Cornelius Pons Head of Palezoology
He asks you a pertinent question and says you need to attend one of his lectures
Cornelius it turns out went to school with Hans Voralberg
He mentions Hans' obsession with a doll the mammoth doll
He tells you the Youkols ancient tribe may have made the mysterious doll
Cornelius explains that birds are migrating to the station from all parts of the world including the strange Amerzone Cuckoo
Those Amerzone cuckoos must be the pesky birds at the base of the ladder in the station
Go back to the Library to see if you can find a book on the Amerzon Cuckoo
Where the ladder is still standing on the mezzanine you'll find a young student who rude as he may be mentions he must be ready for Cornelius Pons' lecture
Maybe you'd better attend that lecture when the time comes
For now it would seem wise and appropriate to present a certain mammoth doll to Professor Pons
It may open some doors for you quite literally
Leave the University you should get a call from Kate's boss Mr Marson about now and go across the plaza outside and across to the train station
Inside the station go screen left up the stairs and then go back screen to the train
Climb aboard and go back to the display area of the train to retrieve the mammoth doll
Get off the train again and retrace your steps across the bridge bear screen right across the plaza and back into the University
Inside go screen right and right again down the hall to the Professor
Show the mammoth doll to the Professor
He recognizes it to be Han's doll
The Professor asks you to attend his lecture and gets your cell phone number so he can call you when he's ready
Meantime he's taken the mammoth doll on a short term loan basis to examine it more carefully in his Laboratory
He leaves for the Lab
Walk forward behind the Professor and follow him into the Lab
Go screen left to a glass front cabinet and remove theBarrockstadt Voice Cylinder
It will be added to your inventory
Walk back to the center of the room and walk screen forward
In the next screen use your cursor to find a hot spot at the far end screen right of the first row of work tables
When Kate walks over there take theYangala Cola Powderfrom the table
This stuff is going to come in mighty handy
You've already read about the mushroom's powers
Go to the table where the Professor is standing and speak with him Click on quot Mission quot to hear a little more about his upcoming lecture
Leave the Lab and go screen left to the Library on the other side of the foyer
When you enter the Library go down the stairs and note the young man at screen right rear has moved over one seat
Wonder why
Use your cursor to find the hot spot on the table where the young man first was sitting
Click on it to pick up Alexander Valembois' book entitled quot Amerzone Souvenirs d'une expedition quot Doesn't this little quot turkey quot look familiar
Remember the hostile flying fowl under the ladder
The Amerzone Cuckoo's favorite food is Sauvignon grapes both vine and fruit
Interestingly enough for your purposes the silly bird makes itself drunk if it eats too much
Learn also that the parasitic cuckoo lays her eggs in another bird's nest as she cannot be bothered with raising her own young
Seems as though we've seen a sort of scale apparatus on that structure in front of the University that might just accommodate such an egg if you could find one
B The Bandstand The Sauvignon grape is rare in the wild but the University has managed to grow the grapes in the Botany Collection
Sounds like a trip back to the jungle area in the train station might be in order
Go back out of the Library the University across the plaza to the train station
Back inside the station go up on the bridge and in the middle come down screen front
Walk forward along the platform until you see a man standing on the stream's sandy bank
Speak to him
When you have the opportunity ask about all the items in your notebook
The man is the Barrockstadt station master
He may just have a bit of a guilty conscience about something
He wanted you to move the train but he's no real help
He tells you that he is also the ornithologist and curator of the station aviary
He mentions a mysterious mechanical eagle that collects cuckoo eggs but its been broken for years and he's not physically able to fix it
Finally you ask about Sauvignon and he's secretive about where the grape vines can be found
He abruptly leaves
Walk down the bank toward the water and pick up thehookfrom the sand
Go back up top and screen right back to the bridge
At the top of the bridge go right toward the main station entrance
You'll see the station master on the bridge
Speak to him again to review your conversation if you need to
He did tell you to quot go see the old guy with the fossils quot So go back to the laboratory at the University down the hall screen right of the University foyer and ask Professor Pons about quot Sauvignon quot from your notebook
All of a sudden everyone seems ignorant about those pesky grape vines
Now you have to go talk to those uncooperative Rectors again
Leave the laboratory and go screen forward and then left screen all the way to the Library door
Go screen left back to the Rector's hall
Inside approach the Rectors again with your quot little problem quot Ask them about quot Bird quot and quot Sauvignon quot The Rectors say there are no Sauvignon vines in Barrockstadt
They mention a garden behind the station
It's a secret though
When you've exhausted the conversation with the Rectors go back to the train station straight up to the bridge where the station master is standing
Ask him about quot Sauvignon quot Learn about the little smuggling operation going on at Barrockstadt
Ask the station master to open the gate to the garden and then follow him there over the bridges and down the path where you earlier found the locked gray metal door
After cautioning you to keep quiet the station master leaves you along in the garden
Its a wonder how well blackmail works huh
Go out through the now open door and into the garden
Continue forward along the path to the edge of the forest white barked birch trees
Use your cursor to get theSauvignon grapesfrom the vines straight ahead of Kate
Return along the path into the station and out to the base of the stairs
Go screen right and forward back to the cuckoos under the ladder
Give the rude little meanies the Sauvignon grapes
Shortly they will begin eating them which gives you the opportunity to climb the ladder
Continue on up above the train where you see the eagle automaton that Professor Pons spoke about
Go look at the bird's nest on the eagle's back
You can't reach the oddly colored oversized egg
Darn it
Go back to the bridge
Cross to the second arch and the station master will hail you to give you abottle of wine
No point in pursuing conversation to ask about how to reach the cuckoo's egg
The station master has nothing new to add at this point
Go back to the Laboratory in the University
When you reach the Lab walk forward one screen until you can see all the rows of work tables
Then click on the end sink in the first row screen right and get thattest tube holder
Leave the Lab and go back to the station
Cross the bridges and go right to the ladder again
Climb up and use the test tube holder on thecuckoo's eggfrom the nest
Go back to the square in front of the University where the small tower is
You likely realize by now that this little structure must be the Bandstand the Hans designed and constructed while he was a student at the University
When you arrive at the Bandstand go left to the door with the golden egg in the scale apparatus
Place the cuckoo's egg in the empty receptacle
The scale will balance itself perfectly
Click on the wheel to open the door
Step inside
Click on the reddish area on the floor to descend to the machine room of the Bandstand
Now that's an interesting looking device
It looks rather like a music box
Notice the pedestal to the right with two levers
Pull the longer lever to set the Bandstand's long silent automatons to playing a mournful melody
Go back to the train and play the Barrockstadt music cylinder in the pedestal in the display car
Hear Anna's sorrowful message to Hans about the death of their father and the terrible war
Leave the train and cross the bridges to return to the kiosk down at the left screen end of the station platform
Click on the smaller sign on the right side of the kiosk's upright posts
Write down the number to quot contact in case of problems quot
You can call the number and get a bureaucratic runaround if you'd enjoy that but you'll end up having to manually operate the river's locks anyway
C The Barge For now exit the close up and go screen left on the platform
Go screen forward then screen right two times out the station door
When you have walked past the glass doors continue on down the steps ahead of you
To left screen you'll see an old man and woman on a barge
Go to them and strike up a conversation
Ask about everything but particularly ask about quot Help quot and quot Money quot The woman tells you they'll use the barge but they can't help because the locks are closed
They want to tow the train with the barge if you can get the locks open
Now if you can just get the locks open and come up with you'll be in business
Maybe you'll finally be able to get the train moving out of Barrockstadt
Go screen right up the stairs and back into the station
Go across the bridge
Leave the train station and go back to the University
Go to the Rector's hall and talk to them about quot Money quot They want you to fix the Bandstand before they'll give you money
But you've already fixed the Bandstand and its operating quite nicely filling the University square with music
Ask the Rectors then about quot Mission quot and the other subjects
After that ask them about quot Money quot again
This time they'll give you abag of money
Leave the University and go back to the station
Go screen right inside the station and back out the side door down the stairs to the old couple at the barge
After some minor hassle about the broken telephone at the kiosk and the complicated instructions for operating the lock the old couple will toss you akey
Hooray
You can use the key and manually operate the lock
Pick up the key from the platform
Return up the stairs through the station down the platform's length to screen left the kiosk
You'll get a phone call from your mother
She's seeing Franck Malkovitch and is largely social climbing as usual
Don't take her conversation too lightly however
When she lets you go continue on to the kiosk
I wonder when you'll get that call from Professor Pons telling you that he has completed the examination of the mammoth doll and he is ready to start his lecture
When you're at the kiosk in close up use the key
Do you remember the instructions from the cell phone call to that quot contact number quot You can't use your cell phone now but if you need to hear the instruction again or if you haven't called the number yet click out of the close up and key the numbers into your cell phone
The Locks There are instructions on how to operate the locks beside the kiosk's keypad but unfortunately they are in a language you don't understand
Key in The water in the canal should lower draining away into another part of the locks
Go back down left screen and talk to the old couple again about quot Locks quot When the cutscene ends where you see the barge enter the locks run back up to the kiosk keypad
You'll see the barge is already there
Key in You'll see the barge rise to the level of the outer channel and leave the locks
Go back over the bridge to the center and go down on the train side of the bridge
Continue as if to go out to the wall and the winding machine
Before you get to the stairs you'll see the old couple and their barge off to screen left
Talk to them again
Ask them about quot Mission quot You are to return to the train quot attach chain quot and they'll be ready to tow the train forward
Then ask about quot Help quot The old man will complete the conversation by throwing a heavy chain from the barge's deck over to the station platform
Go to the end of the chain and attempt to pick it up
Kate thinks probably something is missing
Maybe something like that incredibly heavy iron hook you've been packing around almost since you arrived in Barrockstadt
Attach the hook to the chain and in a cutscene the barge will pull the train up to a position near the city's outer wall
You'll get another phone call at last from Professor Pons
He's ready to start the lecture in the main hall at the University
As you go back there talk to the station master about quot Train quot and the quot Mission quot Go on over to the University and up the stairs in the foyer left to the auditorium
The lecture is about to begin and Kate finds a seat near the top
She listens attentively to Pons' rather lengthy lecture
After the lecture go to the Laboratory as the Professor asked
Talk to him to pick up the mammoth doll
Choose quot Mission quot You learn the Professor believes that Hans may have gone on to Siberia in search of the Youkols and perhaps living mammoths
When the conversation is over pick up the quot Legend of the Ivory Ark quot from the work table
Then reclaim themammoth dollfrom the other end of the table
Leave the professor and go to the Rector's hall
Talk to them about quot Mission quot and quot Train quot Thank them and leave the University
D The Gatekeeper Go back and talk to Oscar on the newly positioned train
Time to wind up the train again
Talk to Oscar about quot Mission Help Hans and Train quot Take time to put the mammoth doll back on the pedestal in the display car
Then leave the train on the opposite side screen right
Go to the mechanism in the foreground and pull the lever
Turn the wheel as you did the first time back at Valadilene
Pull the lever again to wind the train
Another phone call comes in from Dan who seems to be getting a bit impatient and a little unreasonable
Kate has had enough and there's an unhappy end to this conversation
It looks like Kate is gaining more than just travel experience she's getting better at using both independence and considerable intellect
Enough psychology Get back on the train and talk to Oscar again
Click on quot Mission quot Oscar informs you that all is ready for the train to leave and asks Kate to sit down
In a cutscene Oscar leaves the car and the train moves forward but just to the wall where it stops again
Leave the car screen right on the steps and walk over to the small building beside the track
Now you need an exit visa
Will this run around ever end
Oscar is obviously procedurally obsessive
You can talk to him on all subjects except quot Bird quot You learn only that the person who issues the exit visas may be hanging out around some guard post nearby
You have to get an exit visa its the rule
No way around it
Leave Oscar and go around to the back of the small building
See that door over screen left in the stone wall
Go over there
Open the door and enter the maintenance mechanical area
Go up the stairs to receive another call from your girlfriend Olivia
She wants to know what's going on with Dan
Sounds like she thinks Dan is pretty darn cute
Kate brings her up to date on what's happening and tells her it quot won't be long quot until she is home
You can't go through the gate so go screen forward down the walkway atop the wall
Open the metal doors at the end to enter a workshop lookout room
Yikes
See that uniformed man over there standing behind the telescope
Go talk to him
He's an administrative type all right
Looks more than a bit like Adolph Hitler don't you think
He even assumes a pseudo Hitler stance
No coincidence for sure
Talk to him about everything
He doesn't want to issue you a visa as it is dangerous beyond the wall
Does the Captain seem a bit paranoid to you
Stop here and have a look through the telescope to discover that the Captain is seeing things that definitely are not there
The cossack horseman he sees is only a dead and fallen tree trunk
Exit the telescope and click on the eye glasses with the cracked lens from the battered desk
Yangala Cola Puzzle While you are in the close up pour a couple of glasses of Sauvignon wine
Exit the close up
Flatter the Captain and offer him a glass of wine
He still won't let you have the departure visa you need
When he walks back to the window use the Yangala Cola powder and the wine bottle to refill the two glasses
Only the Captain's will accept the mushroom powder
Exit the close up and speak to the estimable Captain again
You talk him into another drop of wine
He drinks the wine in a mutual and pleasant toast
You convince the Captain to take another look through the telescope
He's astonished that the enemy is really only a dead tree
He then apologizes and hands over the departurevisa
Captain Malatesta has finally saved the day
Leave the Captain and find your way back down to the train
Go to the small building and give Oscar the visa
He will give you aticket
Oscar boards the train
Follow him and give him the ticket he just gave you
He accepts it and off you go finally
The winding machine turns and the train responds by turning the cross key mechanism to lift the massive gate
The train is on its way to well just where are you now
Chapter
Komkolzgrad Dark Servitude A Thievery Exit the train and go screen right
Go to the front of the train and Oscar will hail you
Talk to him
Looks like you'll have to find another winding machine in this dark oppressive place
The air is polluted with heavy metal waste from mining operations
You're off to find a winding machine
Go screen left then screen right twice to climb the ladder on the right leg of one of the giant automatons straddling the train tracks
In the control cabin click on the open cabinet upper left to extract theKomkolzgrad voice cylinder Han's Designsof the giant automatons and aT bar handle
Note the exaggerated red circle on the graphic
On the lighted control panel to Kates' right put the T bar handle in the center slot and push the lever up two times
Press the red button
You'll see a cutscene as the automaton moves ahead
The winding machine in the automaton's leg is activated and the train is again readied to move
There is much to be accomplished in Komkalzgrad before you can leave however
Move the lever on the control panel down once to reposition the automaton
Exit the closeup and go down the steps to see a metal shelf ahead of you on the side of the building
Jump over there and have a look through the hole in the wall
You can't access the area right now so go back up to the control panel
Move the lever down once more
The automaton returns to the original position
Exit the control panel and descend again to the platform
You'll see a shadowy bent figure scuttle into the inner red lit corridor of the platform
Follow that man
Go to the inner door below the red light and try to open it
No dice
The door is locked
Kate will indicate that there might just be another way around
Leave the area and go screen left then screen right to get on the train
You may have noticed that Oscar was missing from his perch in the train engine's cab
Inside the train go all the way back to the caboose to find poor ol' Oscar bound and gagged
Click on his mouth to have Kate free him
Someone has attacked Oscar and has stolen his precious hands
Oscar describes his attacker as a quot monster with a weapon quot Could this be the shadowy figure you saw suspiciously exiting the platform
Talk to Oscar about everything in the notebook
Kate surmises that the attacker might have been Hans Voralberg
In any case the train can't leave the Komkolzgrad station because Oscar's hands are part and parcel of the necessary mechanism to move the train
Before you leave Oscar to his perpetual self absorbed mumblings and get off the train don't forget to pick up thosemetal shears tin snips from the carpet
Stop in the next compartment and play the Komkolzrad music cylinder if you like
This is as good a time as any
Kate will place it on the display case shelf afterward
Leave the train and walk back to the giant automaton at the front of the train
Climb the ladder to the control panel
At the panel push the lever up one time
The automaton will position itself beside the metal shelf you examined earlier
Hop over there and this time use you metal shears to enlarge that raggedy hole
After Kate cuts through enter the room and look around going screen forward
There's a rack of shelves screen left
Get thespark plug
Exit the screen and look through both those dingy windows to see that there is much more to this complex than first appears
Try the door in the corner only to learn that this is another permanent quot you can't go that way quot Leave the room through the hole
Go back to the control panel on the automaton and pull the lever down once
When the automaton returns to its starting position return to the platform
Go down to the end of the train where you see the elevator again
You will get another apologetic call from Dan
Continue to the elevator and descend once more to the mining tunnels Click on the generator
Place the clever little spark plug between the two upright prongs
Pull the lever below and to the right and quot then there was light quot Hooray
B The Mines Walk down the tunnel
You'll see a rat disappear off into a tunnel screen right
Keep Kate walking forward to the elevator at the far end of the tunnel
Ride the elevator to the next floor
When you arrive walk to the heavy metal door at screen left and try it to find that its locked
Click on the lock control system at the left of the door to open it
Enter the open hatch to find that you've unlocked the door under the red light on the station platform
Turn around and go back inside
Go screen right where you find the hot spot
Go up the staircase you see in the next screen
Walk screen right and examine the automaton seated at the enormous pipe organ
It looks like Hans Voralberg was very productive in Komkolzgrad indeed
Get a close up of the organ keyboard and the automaton's hands
Do those hands look a bit of a misfit for this svelte female automaton
Wonder if they were originally designed for a certain obsessive train engineer
Take thescrewdriverresting on the organ at screen left
Leave the organ and come back down the stairs
Go screen forward to the area where you entered
Then go screen forward again past the heavy door
In the next screen go screen left
Notice the ladder to Kate's left
Go to it
Get a closeup
Use your screwdriver to remove the obstructing metal placard and climb up the ladder
Walk to the door at the left and click on it to enter a control area for the mines
There's a suspiciously familiar looking older man wearing a mask who is sitting at the console
Click on him to talk to him about the rude snatching of Oscar's precious hands
Notice that he calls Kate quot little missy quot This expression surely won't make any points with Kate
This strange man has integrated the entirety of the mine's abandoned machinery into that pipe organ you just saw
He needs Oscar's hands so the automaton can play the organ
Talk to this Borodine city director on all the items in your notebook
Borodine has created the organ complex in order that he could be positioned to write and invite operatic soprano Helena Romanski to come back to Komkolzgrad and give a solo performance
Borodine is obsessively in love with Helena
If Kate can get Madame Romanski to come back and perform at Komkolzgrad he'll give back Oscar's hands
He tells you to start looking in the shrine he has created for her
After the cutscene where the Helena shrine module is lowered to the floor continue to question Borodine until all conversation is spent
When you have finished talking to him turn around and leave the control room
Go back down the ladder
In the next screen walk to the back and climb the steps to the module which Borodine lowered earlier
Inside the Romanski shrine walk screen forward twice to the draped dressing room area
Click on the open drawer screen left
Read Helena's scrapbook and learn about the events surrounding her initial visit to Komkolzgrad
Learn also about her great good friend Franck Malkovitch the Russian tenor
Hmmmm doesn't that name sound familiar somehow
Could Helena have gone off to America after her retirement from the stage also
When you've finished with the scrapbook click on the letters hidden beneath it and read of Borondine's many attempts to contact Romanski in Moscow
Now it appears that is most logical to begin looking for Helena in Moscow
Leave the shrine and walk screen left to leave the area
In the next screen go screen right and then go left out through the now open heavy metal door to the station platform
Continuing forward and then screen left go back to the train
Go to Oscar in the caboose
Click on quot Mission quot in your notebook then quot Help quot Kate tells Oscar they must accept Borodine's offer and Kate must leave to find Helena Romanski
But how is Kate going to leave Komkolzgrad without the train
C Finding Alternate Transportation Leave the train
Go back down the platform and enter the door beneath the red light
Go screen forward then left back to the ladder at Kate's left which leads up to the control room and Borodine
Climb the ladder and walk forward to the cage on the other side of the grating
Click on it to learn that it is a gateway to a monorail system but it is controlled from another position
Wonder where that could be
Call your mother
She knows Franck Malkovitch remember
She consults with Franck who is very nearby
He recalls that Helena went on to Aralbad not Moscow
She just might still be living there
Go back toward Borodine's control room door and you will get another phone call from Dan
He's apologizing again
Kate seems even more removed
Go on into the control room and speak to Borodine again
Talk to him about everything including Aralbad a once famous spa
He tells you about a drunken old soldier guarding the space platform on the high plateau here at Komkolzgrad
You will need him to find out more about the monorail and the possibility of alternate transportation to Aralbad
After the conversation leave the control room and go through the monorail gate
The director has activated the monorail
After the cutscene walk around the center rail in the next screen and forward to screen right
You'll get another phone call from Olivia
Olivia provides no helpful information but she does observe that Kate seems more independent and confident
Interesting that she is seeing Dan socially isn't it
Keep Kate going forward and then screen left to the stairway
Climb up to the plateau
Walk screen right along the walkway and click in the center of the round space capsule at upper screen right
Continue up the short staircase to enter the capsule
You'll see the old soldier and his companion vodka bottle
Its obvious he doesn't care much about housekeeping
Take a step screen forward to start a conversation with the old soldier
When the preliminaries are finished use your notebook and choose all topics
Boris Chorov ex cosmonaut is concentrating on drinking
You are able to learn about Souyouz to a minor degree
After the topics have been exhausted walk over and pick up thevodka bottlenear the entry on the floor
This triggers a cutscene where Boris staggers out the door and falls over the railing
Go back inside and get thekeyfrom the shelf above and to the right of Boris' desk
Also pick up and read thespace project cancellation letter
Go outside and around screen front where Boris has fallen into a container
What is that shrieking noise anyway
Use your action cursor on the wheel behind the Boris' container
Then go screen right to the area of the launch platform
Go screen left around the center and up the stairs to another large control room
Go to the console with the display monitor screen right
Pick up theVoralberg key
Insert the key in the cross shaped slot on the console
You can try a few buttons and lever but best you open the rather obscure panel at the lower right
Looks like someone has disconnected the terminal
Click on the wires to reconnect them and activate the monitor screen glows green
While you're over there pick up theblood testing apparatusto the right of that panel the small square gray thing
Then push on the button with the CCW counter clockwise arrows to find that you'll be needing a blood sample
Are they kidding
This is harder than trying to figure out how to draw a mammoth any day
How and from whom does Kate obtain a blood sample
Seems logical that ol' Boris might need a blood test doesn't it
Go out and back across the launching area to where Boris is unconscious in the container
Go up the stairs above where Boris is
Click on the console to the left of the hoist extending out over the container
Use the key from Boris' office shelf on the silver button to the right on the panel
Pull the middle horizontal lever to the left to move Boris' container to the left
Then push the far left vertical lever up to move the container forward away from the console
Push the remaining vertical lever up to shower Boris with cold water and sober him up
Perhaps a lucid conversation is possible after all
Go back down the stairs and around to talk to Boris
He'll need for you to whisper quietly though
Use all the conversation choices from the notebook to make sure you get the entire story on Hans Voralberg and his participation in the now defunct space project
Boris warns you about Borodine being dangerous too and suggests you leave quickly
The subject of Souyouz scaring the birds comes up again it might be worth remembering
You also learn that the airship is programmed to take vacationers to Aralsbad
Boris doesn't know if the airship still works but he lets Kate know it has an automatic piloting system
Boris goes for a nap
Go screen right into the launch area
Continue to the back right where you see birds flying above and go up the stairs
Use the airship key from your inventory to enter the gondola of the airship Note If you don't have the airship key go back and talk to Boris again Pull the vertical lever to the right of the automaton at the ship's wheel
Well darn it it doesn't work
Leave the gondola and come back down the stairs
Walk around to the left left screen of the central launch assembly and meet Boris again
Talk to him about the airship
Boris will make a deal with you if you can help him quot get to the stars quot He'll tell you how the airship works
Use the blood testing kit from your inventory on Boris to get a sample of his blood
Ouch
While Boris goes to the capsule you go right screen and up the stairs to the large control room where you got the blood sample kit
The Blood Sample Puzzle Reinstall the blood testing kit in the receptacle on the console
Push the first button on the left to see the crane raise a capsule out of the floor
Push the next button with the hypodermic syringe
Whoops
Boris' blood alcohol level is too high and your sample goes pfftttt
Just click on the blood tester again to get a sample of Kate's blood
Push the syringe button once again
Now the light above it glows
Push the next button with the revolving arrows which results in Boris being able board the space ship with a short test drive on the centrifuge
Wait a moment of two for Boris' to prepare himself
He'll ask you to quot Press the launch button quot Push the last button with the up arrow to commence count down
Boris manages to partially keep his part of the bargain on helping you with the airship instruction something about quot cranking quot After Boris makes his long anticipated and spectacular lift off in the space ship for his flight to the stars leave the control room
Seems we need to look for a crank that Boris manage to throw out in the knick of time
At the bottom of the stairs go screen left
Ahead of Kate near the boxes at the left of the screen you'll see a reddish object on the ground
Click on it to see Kate obligingly pick up thecrank handle
Go screen left twice to the outer platform
Go forward as if to descend the stairs where you entered Boris' area earlier
Stop there
In this screen you'll see the red light screen left and another stairway
Go up those stairs
That's Souyouz you've been hearing all along
The eagle is up there on a railing screeching like the true eagle he is
At the top of the stairs go back screen and use the crank handle on the red button you see on the pedestal
Wow
Sooyouz goes after those nuisance birds with a true vengeance
After the cutscene go all the way back across the platform across the launch area and up the stairs to the airship
Just open the door this time
Inside the gondola pull that upright lever to the right of the automaton again to engage the motor and drop the lines
Off you go on an impressive scenic ride to Aralbad
Chapter
Aralbad Of Yesterdays A Getting Past Smetana Leave the gondola when the airship comes to rest in Aralbad
It surely appears the glory days at this famous spa and vacation retreat have long since faded away
Come down the stairs and walk screen forward to the fountain square where you receive a call from an angry and impatient Mr Marson
Afterward go screen left past the fountain and enter the Hotel Kronsky
Talk to the manager Mr Smetana about all the items in your notebook
Mr Smetana seems accommodating but you're not staying
He's not so accommodating about revealing the names of current or past hotel guests however including Helena Romanski
After you've completed all items in the notebook click on Smetana again to learn about the bolted door and tight hotel security
Walk screen left away from the desk
Then go screen forward and try to enter the gates ahead of you
No way will that happen for now
While standing at the gates turn left and open the broom closet door
Take thedetergentfrom the fourth shelf down
Back out of the closeup cross the lobby and leave the hotel
Go to the fountain and use the detergent in the fountain
Go back to the hotel
Just to the right of the entry you'll see a large window covered with dark red draperies
Click on them to open them
Now go hit the bell on the front desk
Smetana will come over and eventually will notice that the fountain in the square is spewing copious amounts of soap bubbles
He'll rush off to mop up the square leaving you alone at the desk
Go behind the desk
Get a closeup of the guest registry
Note that Helen Romanski's resident code is and Hans Voralberg's code is
Pick up and read theEdenor Hotels Kronsky Hotel brochure
Note the code hand written in red
Leave the closeup and press the red button on the edge of the desk
Great
It operates the gate to the guest rooms
You can now pass through and into the pool area with no problem
Go through the archway screen left
You're in the hotel lounge
Walk forward and click on James the nurse automaton
When he's finished chastising you talk to him about everything except Aralbad in your notebook
Madame Romanski is out on the pier taking her daily constitutional
He's mum about Hans Voralberg and wants you to be also
You can take a look at the bar console if you like but its not operable until you've done a bit more sleuthing
Go back out of the lounge the way you entered
Go around the swimming pool screen right and then go screen left
Talk to the swimmers playing a game of Chess
They're not really communicating with Kate
They never will so don't bother using your precious time to approach them again
Go screen forward and then through the open door screen right at the end of the pool
Pick up theKronsky hotel cardon the floor with the access code
Leave the room
Go screen left twice to reenter the lounge
Go to the gates on the right and click on the control console to the right of the gates
Key in and pull the lever on the right side
The gates open and you can walk through
Note If the door at the end of the pool is not open meaning you've probably not explored the area while wandering around earlier do this
Enter the lounge area screen left
Talk to James via the note book
Try Helena's resident code on the pier gates
Exit the lounge
Go screen right to the open locker room
Pick up the paper with the access code
Return to the pier gates and try the again
Thanks to T C
of Lemoore CA for the clarification Before you go outside put on the mask you see hanging on the hook to the right side
Go forward out on the boardwalk
Go out to the gazebo at the end of the pier to at last meet Helena Romanski
She's got a headache though and wants to go inside
Turn to go get James when Smetana catches up with you to cause a ruckus about your being out on the pier
Helena scolds him mildly and sends him on his way
B On Ringing the Ship's Bell Step down from the gazebo and see a ship's bell to the left and in front of Kate
Go over to the bell
Click on the chain low to ring the bell and call James
Hmmm
That didn't seem to work
James is not showing up
Well maybe he's hard of hearing
Click on thebellitself to remove it and place it in your inventory
Go back down the boardwalk closer to the hotel where you will see another bell stand
Place the bell on the hook and pull the chain
Still no James
Go back inside the lounge and talk to James
Turns out he hears the bell but won't come out to retrieve Helena because a gusty and damaging salt wind is blowing
After a suggestion that James use Kate's gas mask James goes to get Helena while Kate is again occupied talking to her momsie on the cell phone
Soon James arrives with Helena comfortably seated in the wheel chair
Talk to Madam Romanski about everything
Helena doesn't seem to remember Borodine the director at Komkolzgrad
She feels she is too old to sing anymore but definitely lights up when Hans Voralberg is mentioned
He was her quot dearest sweetheart quot You also learn of a strange cocktail concoction that just might restore Helena's singing voice
George a barman at the Muritz in Paris is the only one in the world who knows the recipe
He invented it
Kate talks Helena into traveling to Komkolzgrad
Helena had come to Aralbad to find a cure for migraine headaches which caused her to give up her career
She decided to just stay on at Aralbad
When the discussion is over its pretty obvious that Kate must try to precisely duplicate the quot Blue Helena quot cocktail
C The Blue Helena Go to the bar console and first find the note tucked up among the bottles above the console
Look at themusical scoreand just take note of the liquors categorized in the upper treble range those in the lower bass range and the subtle symbol and color differences beside the names of the liquors
Leave the lounge area after you've tinkered around with the console controls a bit just for fun
There are more items to pick up and more info to gather before you can whip up that delectable cocktail for Helena
While standing in the middle of the room facing the pool exit out the door at the back of the screen
Go F L F F down the hall to the room at back screen
Pick up acrystal dish wine glass from the table front screen
Leave the room and return to the lounge
In a closeup of the console place the vodka bottle from your inventory in the right side receptacle above the console top shelf
Exit the closeup and open the panel on the inside of the bar just below where Lady Helena and James are standing
Take the halflemonand the jar ofcrystallized honey
Exit the closeup and click on the console again
Place the lemon in the lemon squeezer on the top left shelf
Place the crystallized honey in the receptacle with the screw lid on the top shelf at screen right
Now its time to get some outside help
Exit the closeup
Open Kate's personal inventory and look at the hotel brochure from Aralbad
Remember those numbers handwritten inside
They just might come in handy here when keyed into Kate's cell phone
Do that
Ask to speak to Mr George the Muritz Hotel
Mr George isn't there anymore but the recipe for Blue Helena is
The man on the other end of the line reads it to Kate as follows Blue Helena Recipe After the phone call take the crystallized honey from the console and leave the lounge
Go out the door back screen and go R F F L to the small square spa in back of the chess playing swimmers
Go behind the spa and turn the wheel on the pipes
You see the spa steam
Take the crystallized honey from your inventory and quickly place the honey in the steamy water to liquefy it again
If it doesn't work the first time just try it again
Go back to the lounge
Return to the console
Replace the now liquid honey in the receptacle above the console
On the console After the cutscene Helena drinks the Blue Helena and briefly tries its effect on her voice but she doesn't believe she will be able to sing on the stage ever again
After the conversation when Helena calls James quot a sniveling little creep quot click on Helena again and the put the crystal dish wine glass at the end of the bar near where the automaton track ends
Click on Helena again and turn down the volume on your system
Helena is a believer once again
She can surely belt out an impressive aria now
After the cutscene when Helena is wheeled off to prepare for the trip back to Komkolzgrad leave the lounge by the rear door again
Go screen forward up the stairs and exit the hotel through the lobby
Return to the airship screen right
You'll get another phone call just after you enter the airship
Its Olivia
She reluctantly confesses that she's been quot seeing quot Dan and she feels guilty
Kate is reticent
She doesn't want to talk about it considering the scene she's involved with and she quickly hangs up
The next cutscene reveals the arrival of Helena and James
Chapter
Komkolzgrad Out of the Past Soon enough you're all aloft in the airship headed off to Komkolzgrad to hear Helena on stage in full regalia singing her entire favorite Russian aria
Suddenly Helena is completely imprisoned in a large cage surrounded with steel bars
Could Borodine the Komkolzgrad director have intended to imprison Helena forever
Go up the stairs ahead of you and talk to Helena
You must free her as quickly as possible
Go to the padlocked door of the cage and get a closeup
Use the metal shears to free Helena
The next thing you must do is retrieve Oscar's precious hands so you can leave Komkolzgrad
Go to the automaton at the organ and use the screwdriver to getOscar's hands
Go back down the stairs and screen forward back to Helena
After a quick discussion Helena enters the opened doorway to the platform and you are trapped by the director again as the doorway is barred to Kate
Kate gives Oscar's hand to Helena and tells her to return to the train and tell Oscar to get ready to leave
Helena leaves
Go to the elevator screen right
Reenter the elevator to the mine shaft
Move forward twice to hear the shaft collapsing behind you
Turn around
Notice the air shaft to the right near the front of your screen
Click on it
You can't get in there with your bare hands and you have nothing left in your inventory
Continue forward to the head of the tunnel and pull the lever screen right hard to see to call the elevator
Oh gad
The elevator arrives armed with a ticking time bomb
In a cutscene run like the very hounds of Hades are after you back down the tunnel
The bomb explodes
It blows up the elevator and the tunnel partially collapses
Ah but the good news is that it also blew open the air shaft
Go to the air shaft and get the heck out of there and back on the train
Leave the car and go to the engine to talk to Oscar
Kate will have none of his policy for supplemental passengers and he quickly understands that Kate's sharp tone means he'd better do as she says and get the train moving
Now
Get back on the train to receive another call from Dan
Kate gives him an opportunity to speak up about what happened with Olivia
He finally does
Kate tells Dan they may talk about things when she gets home but she doesn't sound optimistic
She says goodbye
Go talk to Oscar again
Iron bars have appeared across the track at the front of the train
Borodine has thought of one final plan to stop Helena from leaving Komkolzgrad
Go down to the opposite end of the platform where the elevator shaft is
Click on those wooden packing boxes to find another bomb all wired up and ready to go
What a nice coincidence
Pick up the bomb
Take it down the platform and attach it to the leg of the giant automaton holding the iron bars
In a cut scene an explosion splinters the trap and the train is quickly on its way out to Chapter
Aralbad Fini When Kate is free to move about again leave the train and go rear screen toward the front of the train
Then go forward right screen to find Oscar at the end of the platform
Talk to him
Then use your notebook to cover all subjects
Afterward go to the train's winding mechanism and use the wheel and the lever to wind it again
Be sure to use the wheel to retract the rod completely
You haven't found Hans Voralberg yet though
Go back over to Oscar and ask him about the quot Mission quot He'll tell you to get on the train get comfortable and off you will go
Afterward Smetana arrives with a message for Kate about a mysterious package that has arrived and can be picked up at the hotel's front desk
Go to the front desk of the hotel and look at the open box on the counter down near the television set
Wow
Its anautomaton mammoth
Pick it up
Your cell phone rings
Its Mr Marson
Kate cuts him short and the hotel's telephone rings on the counter
Its for Kate a call from Helena Romanski
Go to the hotel lounge again and speak with Helena
She suggests you walk out to greet the plane which is arriving with supplies for the hotel
Go outside on the boardwalk without the gas mask this time
Why there's Hans Voralberg sitting on the bench
Talk to him
He says he's going away far away to Syberia
As he is the legal heir to the Voralberg estate Kate still needs his signature on the sales contract for the factory there
He obligingly signs the contract and is eager to go away from Aralbad on the train
You receive a call from Marson again
You don't need him to send reinforcements
The deed is done and you have Hans' signature on the sales contract
Marson wants Kate home the next day
It appears to be time to head for New York at flank speed
Kate parts company with Hans and goes out on the pier to the plane
All of a sudden it appears that Kate has changed her mind about going home
There doesn't seem to be all that much worth going back to now does there
Kate rushes back to the platform to see the departing train
She jumps on the train and is off on a new journey with Hans Voralberg
It looks like Kate has made a life changing decision
She really does love adventure and the company she's been keeping
She has decided to pursue this sojourn to the end
I wonder what wondrous sights and new dilemmas await her in mysterious Syberia

The story begins with Kate rsquo s boss Mr Marson talking in the background to someone about getting her back and his being told she rsquo s not coming back The scene is of the train rolling along amid the falling snow ldquo Call her rdquo the boss says
There will later be another similar occurrence where the boss calls a private detective Nick Cantin with the intention of sending him to look for Kate
ROMANSBOURG Then we findKateon the train talking toHansabout his dream of finding Syberia She doesn rsquo t seem to believe it really exists but he tells her of the grass that grows through the snow and of the Mammoths eating this year round
When the conversation ends the scene changes as she is ready to leave the train One step and her cell phone rings and she findsOscaris now able to talk to her from HIS cell phone which Hans has made for him Oscar tells her they are in the town ofRomansbourg
Before leaving you might want to check out the bathroom It rsquo s through the door to the left of the exit hellip hellip hellip where Oscar always stood in the first SYBERIA game After all you may have to go there later Upon leaving the train she meets a man with a peg leg and a cane The conversation with him is automatic He isRetired ColonelEmeliov Goupatchiev Guardian of the Imperial Marches and General Store Manager In the middle of the introduction he is interrupted by a public address system welcome to the city ofRomansbourg
Down the platform to the rear of the train is a lever and a gate the lever accomplishes nothing and the gate is locked and impassable
Across from where you got off the train is a machine of some sort Pull the handle and operate it and it appears to be a coal machine hellip hellip with no coal being dispensed
Go back to where you departed from the train and there is a store at that point along the platform Inside you can talk again to theColonelwho tells you he rsquo s in charge of the administration of this jurisdiction If you want continue further past theColoneland you rsquo ll find a close up of a broken candy machine with a key in the tray to the left Take theKey Also note the telephone number on the bottom of the candy machine hellip hellip On your way out stop at the candy machines near the door You have no money so you rsquo re not going to buy any candy at this point are you Maybe there rsquo s some money in the candy machines We rsquo ve already taken the key why not the money And maybe a little candy too Use theKEYto open the first machine hellip well no money Second machine hellip hellip same Third machine hellip hellip coins in the drawer Take the coins and use them to buyCandyfrom the first two machines Want to take back the money too Why not Close the drawers first two close O K

Try calling the candy company You might can get that third machines rsquo drawer fixed Remember the phone number hellip Didn rsquo t help did it They rsquo re closed down and all you got was a commercial for the candy Oh well it seemed like a good idea at the time

SymBioCom Walkthrough Episode The Rident Your essential task on board the Rident is to find your way off
The Rident's propulsion systems are down so you need to find another means of transportation
The answer is a craft you find in the shuttle bay
The shuttle is not equipped for long distance travel however so in order to make it off the Rident you must use the Rident to open a wormhole something the shuttle is not equipped to do and then fly the shuttle into the wormhole
Although your shuttle is low on fuel wormholes connect two points of great distance in space
The wormhole will take you to the nearest space station and the next episode Gaining Access To The Shuttle There's a shuttle on Level in the bay which is your ticket off the Rident
The first thing you'll notice is the shuttle's entrance is blocked against a window
On Level among the missing passengers' items you'll find a suitcase containing a pair of explosives the belongings of a would be terrorist on board
Take these
Returning to the shuttle observatory place a bomb on the window
This will get you through the window
Before entering the shuttle access the panel next to it

This system is locked out with an access code
You'll find this code in the next section Activating The Wormhole Wormdrive the system that harnesses the power of a wormhole has been taken off line
First you must activate the system
Wormdrive is locked out at the moment due to the attack so you must find the code
This is found on the ship's computer in the flight room which is also locked out
To gain access to the ship's computer you have to crash it
Go to Level and access the panel opposite the elevator in the hall
This is the environmental control for the ship
Find the code for the computer core and using the environmental controls raise the temperature a bit
Eventually you'll cause a fire in the computer core and crash the system

You'll find the system has experienced a core dump
Reading through the muck you'll discover the code for the wormdrive
You'll also find the code for the shuttle bay door
Make a note of it you'll need it later
Onto Engineering you find the wormdrive system
Enter the code and activate wormdrive
Don't forget to re route wormdrive control to the flight cabin the system near the door on the way out

to fuel your shuttle
An ancient station Plasfo has some obsolete systems
An example of this is poorly shielded conduits on Level
Your sym will remind you here that stepping too close to the conduits may cause your credit computer to magnetize
To get an extra five credits use your credit computer found in your inventory with the conduits on Level
Some areas will actually deduct your credit total so be careful
You're aiming for the area just above the word quot with quot in the sentence quot Use Credit Computer with what quot Click five times to increase total to
Getting Into Rendel's Booth Rendel keeps a log of passing ships but he's not volunteering his information
First you need to get him out of his booth
To do this you must provide a distraction
Go up to the bathroom on Level
Attach the other bomb you found in Episode to the mirror
This will keep Rendel busy for awhile
Rendel a suspicious sort has locked his booth
Before returning to Level stop by the bridge
On the side on the right of the stairs you'll find a section of loose piping
Take this
Back at Rendel's booth use the pipe to break the lock
Inside the booth read the log
Your sym will record the coordinates of the quot dog ships quot From here return to your shuttle and move on
Episode Carswell Colony Apparently the next place the dog ships hit was Carswell Colony an uncharted colony of quot rebels quot from the ITC
Your task here is to find out what happened to the colonists and to try to connect this mystery with the missing passengers on the Rident
Unlike the Rident there is one living survivor left on Carswell other than you
You can communicate with him via a monitor in the hall on Level
He'll need you to get him out of the control room
To free him you'll have to get the elevator on line but you can't get to the utility room without figuring out a way past a barricade
Once you've quot freed quot the colonist you'll have to track down those pesky dog ships again The Barricade One of the colonists has locked out a room on Level by disabling the conduits which control the doors to the room
One of these doors is found in the bathroom
Here you'll notice a section of conduit has actually been removed cutting off power to the door
Take the tool the colonist used to slice up the panel
Go downstairs to the kitchen
Here you'll have your first glimpse of an attack drone left behind
He leaves you alone
Apparently he's been programmed to ignore you
Inside the kitchen you'll find more conduits
Using the tool cut a piece out
Say Hi to the cat
Back up stairs use your new piece of conduit with the bathroom door's conduit
You can now enter the locked out room
Getting The Elevator On Line The guy on the monitor in the hall on Level tells you to get the elevator on line
He may be able to answer some questions so you need to help him out
The utility room which controls station operations is accessed via the vents in the room you just opened
Explore the vents until you find the utility room
You'll also find a camera in the vents
Take this you'll need it later
Inside the utility room there's that annoying drone again link to the controls
You'll notice the elevator has no power going to it
Route the source power from SL to the destination power for EV
The elevator is now on line
Don't forget to talk to the guy in the hall again before going downstairs
He'll need to take the locks off the elevator
Finding The Next Destination Of The Dog Ships In the control room you'll find the attack drone got to the colonist before you
Link to his sym to find out some useful information
Now you need to track down the dog ships
Link the camera you found in the vents to the computer in the control room
The camera has weeks of footage and somewhere on it there's some shots of the attacking dog ships
You don't have weeks to wait around so you'll need to find the exact time the dog ships attacked
To find the time of attack go to Carswell's room
Ignoring the colony leader's corpse read the speech he was dictating
The attack struck while he was recording the speech and at the top of the PDA is the time the speech was logged
Back in the control room link the camera to the computer again
Jump to the counter entry matching the time on Carswell's PDA
From the footage of the dog ships your sym can calculate the vessels' trajectory
Apparently their next target is SYNSYM the corporation which designed your sym implant
Return to your shuttle and take off Episode Synsym This branch of SYNSYM the original office has long since closed but for some reason the dog ships were heading this way
First you need to get inside the building
To do this you'll have to use the delivery entrance
Once inside the various office memos left by the partners Reynolds Lowery and Debrise will shed some light on the inner workings of the SYNSYM corporation
Someone also left you a hologram message here indicating you have an ally in all this
His identity will be revealed later
As you explore you discover Reynolds' log book is missing
Finding it will lead you to a hidden laboratory a discovery Reynolds made herself a few days before her quot accidental quot death
When you try to leave SYNSYM after completing all this you'll find the dog ships waiting for you Getting In The front door is locked so begin by hopping over the wall on the right
Around the back of the building you'll find another door to which cargo was once delivered
Search the cargo crates on the side of the building
On top of one you'll find an old clipboard once used to inventory cargo shipments
The delivery computer which controls this door works on a basic principle a shipment clipboard like the one you just picked up tells the computer what cargo is being delivered its description and weight and a scale by the door weighs the cargo to confirm the inventory listed on the clipboard
You need to pose as cargo
Examine the clipboard in your inventory
You can select items on the list which together add up to various weights
The magic weight you're looking for is the player's weight To find the player's weight bring up the STATUS screen
It appears you weigh Pelists
Returning to the clipboard select the items which weigh P P and P Together they weigh P Use the clipboard with the delivery computer and step on the scale
You're in
Memos And Finding Sandra's Missing Log Jacques Debrise and Christian Lowery both kept logs of their office memos
Sandra Reynolds the late CEO has no log book however
In Lowery's office you'll find an quot antique quot computer in the corner which Reynolds gave him
On the computer screen Sandy typed a hurried note instructing Lowery to quot check out the Coleridge quot In Reynolds' office you'll discover she was something of an art collector with a particular focus on the artist Jolfoar
One painting behind her desk is especially interesting because your sym will tell you that Jolfoar based the painting on the poem quot Kubla Khan quot by Samuel Taylor Coleridge
On her desk you'll find a button to release this painting revealing a hidden safe
The password for the safe has to do with her message and the nature of the painting hiding it
Both your sym's database and Lowery's memos will remind the player that the poem quot Kubla Khan quot was about a magic place called Xanadu
Enter quot Xanadu quot to open the safe
Finding The Hidden Lab The log in Reynolds' safe speaks of a hidden lab she found one night a laboratory she knew nothing about
Repeat what she does in the log entry
First go to the laboratory on the bottom level
Inside the lab there are some more work drones
Activate them with the computer behind them
You'll notice one drone is down and appears to function on a different subroutine
You're going to need a routine disk for the separate drone in the lab
You'll find one in the trash can in Debrise's office
Use the routine disk with the dormant drone in the lab
A schematic will come up
Repeating the procedure outlined by Reynolds in her log connect E to A E to A and E to A
This will activate the drone who will open a hidden door in the back of the lab This reveals yet another keypad
To figure out this password you'll have to remember all signs are pointing to Debrise
The disk for the drone was in his office and in her log Reynolds hinted that Debrise knew about this secret lab
By reading through Debrise's memos in his office and Lowery's logs you'll learn that Debrise's favorite term was quot monumental quot Enter quot monumental quot to open the door to the secret lab
Inside the lab you'll find some curious and frightening equipment including a bed with hand restraints
Here your sym malfunctions and appears to have quot flashbacks quot of some sort presenting you with some strange images that neither of you can explain
These flashbacks allow your sym to lead you to a PDA hidden in a nearby table
The PDA a note from Debrise to an unknown person refers to quot experiments quot and quot a secret base quot From the PDA you get the coordinates for the secret facility
Taking Out The Dog Ships Curious about the secret base mentioned in the note you return to your shuttle to take off
Unfortunately the dog ships show up
You can't outrun the dog ships so you'll have to stand and fight
Access your weapons system
Firing on the dog ships produces no effect
Their armor is too strong
You'll notice SYNSYM's power generator is in view however
Fire on it
The chain reaction will take the dog ships down
On your way you hear a voice communication from the mystery ally who left you the holograms
He's going to meet you at the facility the final episode
Episode The Facility Crash landing on the planet you'll find an entrance to the facility
First you need to get inside with a little help from your sym
After bypassing a series of security drones you'll find kept here you'll learn SYNSYM's secret
With no where to go but onward you have to bypass a PhysioScanner
At this point you meet up with your ally from Episode
Together you and he will destroy the facility
Before doing that your sym will insist on having some questions answered which leads to a confrontation with Debrise face to face
Finally you have to destroy the base
Getting Inside Getting inside is relatively easy
Linking to the elevator controls your sym will make some suggestions of possible security codes
Although it might not seem so at first your sym does have the right code
Bypassing First Drone Once inside you'll find a security drone like the one left behind in Episode is blocking your progress
First you need a blunt object
You'll find a section of loose piping in the utility closet
Take this
You can't attack the drone just yet
You need to distract him
To do this videotape him
After you make your movie use the camera with the panel near the video monitor in the hall
This will upload the movie and play the footage you recorded
The drone noticing the image will fly toward the monitor
Quite taken with his likeness he'll keep his back to you as he watches the movie
Sneak up behind the drone and hit him with the pipe
Bypassing Second Drone Remembering that the drones run on a network link to the downed drone in the hall
Apparently there is another drone waiting for you in the next room
You'll notice this new drone's batteries are low
Instruct him to recharge
You're now free to enter the room on the left
A panel in the back a doorway for the security drones will lead you to the drone recharging center
Bypassing The Third Drone Stepping out into the hall off the recharging center you find yet another drone waiting for you and they seem to be getting meaner and meaner
To take it out you'll need to fight fire with fire
Link to the drone you sent to recharge
From the local menu you can select a target
Don't select the target on the left that's you
Select the target on the right and you'll get the drone's perspective as it flies off and shoots down the last drone
You're now free to explore
Learning Synsym's Secret The most important information to find on this level is Professor Miller's log found in the first room on the left
From this log you'll learn the fact that sym implants like yours are actually copies of another human being's brain and that in order to create a sym implant the person's life is taken
Also on this level you'll find one of the passengers from the Rident Senator Fellows who appears to have been prepped for a sym implant
Tricking Physioscanner At the end of the hall there is a door locked off by something called a PhysioScanner
A PhysioScanner scans your genetic profile to determine if you have access
Your sym reminds you that if you had a record of some DNA of a person who did have access the sym could trick the scanner
In one of the rooms you'll find a DNA sampler and a computer to identify DNA
Currently a sample of Senator Fellows' DNA is on the sampler
You need to find a sample of DNA of someone who has access to the rest of facility however
In another lab you'll find a coffee cup
Scan the coffee cup with the DNA sampler
Return to the lab with the DNA computer and upload the sample
Apparently the beverage belonged to Norma Miller the missing professor and mastermind of sym technology
Back out in the hall try the PhysioScanner again
By tricking the computer into thinking you're the professor you can now pass
Getting Off The Dog Ship And Finding Some Answers After another nasty spill you black out and have another flashback
Awaking you find yourself inside one of the dog ships
The voice of your ally from Episode tells you you're safe however
Apparently a busy man your ally left a PDA in your inventory explaining himself
Reading the PDA you learn that your ally is none other than Christian Lowery Reynolds' other partner
Suspicious of Debrise's activities Lowery found out the truth about sym technology too
His plan is to destroy the base
He won't admit it but he needs your help
After you leave his ship you can explore a wormhole room and the reactor room
From there you can take another elevator by entering the code Lowery gave you on the PDA quot conscience quot The only room you can get to via the elevator at this point is a room that contains a database of all those victims who died to become a sym
Once inside this room your sym will not let you back out the door until you look up its identity
Check your status screen again to get your sym's ID number SYM
Enter it into the computer
Ironically your sym was once Sandra Reynolds the CEO of SYNSYM whose death was anything but accidental
Once she found out Debrise's secret he had her eliminated
No wonder Lowery Sandra's long time friend wanted to keep your sym implant safe
Taking Debrise Down Now you can go to the observatory room
On your way in you're nearly shot by Debrise who sneaks up behind you
Hiding behind his desk Debrise taunts you
Your only exit is over the railing behind you
It's quite a fall but luckily the gravity is low because the room serves as a shuttle bay
Having made your escape you return to the passage way but find there's no where to run
Returning to the wormhole room you'll find Debrise waiting for you
You can't run but you'll notice a control panel across the room
Thanks to the ingenuity of sym technology you can link to computers over a great distance
Link to the panel and turn on the gravity in the room using the code your sym gives you
That takes care of Debrise
Leveling The Base To destroy the base you'll need to sabotage the wormdrive
Like the Rident this facility can harness a wormhole the only difference being that the facility can open a wormhole within the base inside the room where you smashed Debrise
There's a wormhole beacon in the wormhole room
You need to move it
Return to the observatory room and access the panel on the desk
Release the beacon
Go back to the wormhole room
Pick up the beacon and take it to the reactor room across the hall
Place the beacon on the reactor
Back in the observatory room activate the wormdrive
Opening a wormhole in an improper place will cause a reactor meltdown
Lowery's dog ship will show up and take you out of there in the nick of time You've won Symbiocom but the story is not over GAME BOOMERS hints cheats and walkthroughs
