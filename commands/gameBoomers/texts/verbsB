That's the fan you luckily turned off
Enter the vent Watch the cutscene
Now you are in the sewer pipe again
Save your game
NOTE You have to find your way all the way back to the bathroom The situation varies here according to what you have accomplished previously
But you will be racing against time If you don't get the end sequence actions accomplished in time you will witness the first sad ending to the game
THE BATHROOM Find the gold coin on the floor just in front of the urinal Its also to the right from the overturned green paint can and brush Crawl up on the coin A silverfish will appear with a message Watch the cutscene Then climb back up to the top of the urinal Go up the wall Then go right and up to the top of the bulletin board frame Find the unpainted area Follow it up to the smoke detector Crawl over and sit on the test button Then return down the wall to the lighted cigarette IMPORTANT NOTE If the cigarette is still placed in the ash tray you will not be able to move it You have missed something along the way And you will have to explore to find and complete any action you have missed If you find that the cigarette has burned down and has fallen out of the ash tray onto the surface of the urinal you haven' t missed anything and you can push it off onto the floor Do it
Then climb down to the floor and push the cigarette butt so it touches the paper towels Watch the end game cut scene You have saved the old landlord That's the good ending
But wait what about you There's an even better ending Quickly because this is also a timed sequence go back down the drain in the bathroom and make your way back to your room where you are that pathetic human being unconscious on the floor Run over and climb up on the locket beside your outstretched hand before time runs out You might have to do this several times before you figure out the route and perfect the timing
Then watch the best ending
Good going End game

Note Youcouldhave approached the trench right after getting the third piece of the Artifact from Emma and dug up this same image of the Artifact in the ground In that case you would have been quot allowed quot to place those three piecesdirectlyonto this image But the following cut scene would have struck you as peculiar The game credits would still be the same leading at least some unsuspecting gamers to think that they havesuccessfullycompleted the game Not so of course because we would have left out that whole business of the lens the Altar Stone as well as the quot mending quot of the Artifact
The Correct Ending As the image of the Artifact appears a very short cut scene will follow indicating the breaking of the ground and your falling below You will find yourself inside some kind of a tomb
Feel free to explore and find all seven of the egg cups each in a separate chamber of sorts You may even close up and click on each or any one of them to see a replay of the cut scene that had initially followed when you had placed that cup on the appropriate stone After you are done exploring return to the point where you had landed after the ground had broken And if you never leave the spot after landing just turnrightand you will see a large circular slab in front of you Close up on ittwice and then click on the Artifact in your inventory to see it neatly set in its place

Betrayal in Antara Walkthrough and CheatsWalkthrough by Lord Marcus Dracondracon loom net auCheats from Zzardoz Betrayal in Antara Walkthroughby Lord Marcus Dracon Chapter This is a fairly straight forward chapter
The object is to get Aren and William to Panizo so that Aren can study with the Escobar mage Finch
You start off in the town of Briala
Just as a matter of course you should speak with Aren's father Tyre Cordelaine he is just in front of the inn and Laura who is supposed to be Aren's future wife and Aren isn't too happy about that
A good suggestion for people who are starting off slowly sleep at Tyre's inn you won't be charged for staying there and there is no food used when staying at an inn
This will get Aren's spell skills up it takes a while but you will be able to learn more spells more quickly Just south of town as you are traveling to Aspreza there are some men harassing a woman Kaelyn Usher
You must defeat these men in battle and then Kaelyn will join your group
From there it is just a matter of traveling to Panizo
The shortest route is the best if you're in a hurry
It is Briala to Aspreza to Balmestri to Sortiga to Panizo
Once again I will warn you that you miss out on much of the game this way
When you get to Panizo simply click on the Escobar Estates and the chapter will be over Chapter This chapter starts getting things more complicated Your first order of business is to find the mage Finch so that he may train Aren Finch is located directly West of the town of Panizo in a little cleft in the mountains Go to Finch and he will tell you that he will teach Aren if you can find him a cup of Chailan Tea
Go the Peerless Importers in Midova Order the tea with the shopkeeper
Sleep in the inn for a week Go back to the shop and you will discover that everything has been stolen including your order of Chailan Tea
Talking to the merchant leads you to the fact that the tea was taken by a man named Antoni who owns the City Financiers also in the same city Go to him and he will tell you that if you collect on an old debt for him that he will give you the tea back
In order to collect on this debt you must find a mystic named Enkudi He was last seen in Montari Territory This territory is located just to the east of Sortiga If you head down to Sortiga and take the road to the east you will come to a fork Take the fork to the North
You will meet up with Enkudi on the road just north of there He will give you the gems that Antoni wants back Just a side note here take the quest that Enkudi offers you it will give Aren the skill of WATER
Take the gems back to Antoni and give them to him There seems to be some confusion on how to give items to NPC's so I will explain it
When you are in the NPC screen i e
the background is meshed out and the NPC is on the screen with the topics in the top right corner bring up one of the characters inventory screen Notice that in the box where your food and burlas is listed there is a man
That is the NPC Drag the gems onto this portrait Antoni gives you the Chailan tea Take this to Finch Next he will tell you that in order to teach Aren William must watch his eggs and he asks you if you will do that do not click on anything a Yes or No option will come up it takes a second or two Click on Yes and Aren will study with Finch Finch teaches Aren the following SELF ALLY and RESIST skills three other spell skills will go up by points each as will his spell casting skill
After all this you must get our heroes to Ticoro In order to go West you must cross a bridge but the one on the road that is shown on the map is not useable You must cross at a bridge which is south of where Finch is located
The bridge is in a little gap in the mountains you either have to look for it or navigate next to the mountains in the overhead map view Once you cross the bridge proceed to Ticoro Once you are in the gates and you meet up with Raal Kaelyn's friend the chapter is over One hint take a look at the Ticoro map in the town section you must get to the inn that you can stay at quickly There are many battles in the streets of Ticoro and you will need a place to heal
The Henne's Shadow Inn is the only place to rest in Ticoro Chapter This chapter is where you finally begin your quest for the consort which is a part of the main story First you must go to the North Gate house you can get the locations of everything mentioned here by looking at the Ticoro Town Map Talk to the Captain of the Guards Nothing will come of this but as you are leaving you mention to your companions that you saw a hole that hasn't been fixed right above the room that you were in and that you might be able to listen in from up there In order to do this you must get on the Ramparts There is of course a gate which blocks you from doing this You need to get the key Go to the Keys and Bolts shop and speak to the owner He will give you a copy of the key if you can discover who has been popping his quot unpickable quot locks all over the city and giving him a bad name It turns out that it was his former apprentice who is responsible for picking the locks
He is located in the south east corner of the town map after you talk to the owner of the Keys and Bolts After talking with him go back and talk to the owner of the Keys and Bolts and he will give you a copy of the Rampart Key Take this to the gate and open it Go up and walk along the ramparts until you are above the gate house
You will see the hole Click on it and you will discover that the consort is staying at The Green and White Inn After you have discovered this go to the inn and try to get in After this you can't get in return to your room and go to sleep This ends the chapter At this point Caverton's guards will burst in and take you from your room Chapter This chapter is a long and twisting chapter It is thus far the longest chapter that there is
First Raal breaks you out of prison and tells Kaelyn that her father has disappeared and that Raal's pack leader has a request to make of her She leaves with Raal
This will split the part up for the next chapters you get back together again at the end of chapter For this chapter you stay with William and Aren Your goal is simple Get into the Shepard's Headquarters Unfortunately you have no idea where to start you don't even have a Shepard's Medallion anymore because Lord Caverton's men took the one you had So here's what you have to do First go north to Isten There you need to get into the theatre to meet Maria Liana
In order to do that you need to get tickets to the theatre as the amphitheatre is all sold out The tickets are located in a bead chest just to the south of Isten
If you find this difficult just beat the Lord in the inn at cards and he will give you his ticket After you get the tickets go to the theatre Talk to Maria Liana and she will tell you that Simon is her son and that he is presently a Child of Henne and he is stationed in Durst That is all the info you need from her When you get to Durst you will meet a Child of Henne named Jhana she is located in the local Temple of Henne You discover that Simon was reassigned by the Hand of Henne This is an NPC that you met in Ticoro Head back to Ticoro and you will meet him at the crossroads at the gate of Ticoro He will tell you that he reassigned Simon to the Chapel in Ravenne
Upon going to Ravenne you will find his house because you are attacked by several imperial guards You must defeat them
You will find a letter inside Simon's house that he has gone to officiate at a wedding in Levosche
When you get to Levosche you will find Simon
He tells you the location of the Shepard's Headquarters it is located just north of Ticoro by a lake there He tells you that you need a Shepard's Medallion to get in He buried his in his garden in Ravenne Go there and double click on the garden and you will get the Medallion Take this to the Shepard's Headquarters and use it to open the door Look under the quest page to discover how to open the door using the medallion Once the door opens the chapter ends One major hint before you go through that door you need to stock up on food and torches if you are going to explore the caverns you run low quickly Chapter For this chapter you trade in William and Aren in for Raal and Kaelyn
Your objective in this chapter is to find Kaelyn's father and talk with Raal's Pack Leader Kaelyn's father is located north of Darvi in The Waste When you head up there you will run into the pack's leader just north of Darvi The pack leader will tell you that there are Wraith's in the Waste and that there is no way to kill them at this point you should not attempt to fight them as you cannot kill them After talking with him continue north and you will find Kaelyn's father's house in the Waste
There is a note there telling you that he is in a cave to the north of the waste
Head to the north west and you will find the entrance note it is easier to find on the overhead map Make sure you have torches with you He is located in the back of the cave He tells you that he is a mage and he came up with a formula that can kill wraiths You apply it to your weapons You can now kill the wraiths For the next part of this chapter you must kill all the wraiths
They are all in the Waste After that go back to Kaelyn's father That is the end of this chapter Chapter This chapter again returns us to William and Aren The are inside the Shepard's Headquarters The first goal is to find the way out difficult because you can't get there until you win the chapter
First you must open the word lock chest in the south eastern part of the cave system
The answer to this chest is Malkere Inside you will find a lantern of sorts All the way to the east of the cave system you should use Spelunker's Star to find your way is a door with a series of buttons on it In order to get the correct code place the lantern over the flame and certain buttons will be circled with blue Push all of these buttons and the door will open
After that there is a series of passages which will eventually take you to the leader of the Shepards After you speak with him you discover that the consort was kidnaped from them The mage that kidnaped him shows up just as you are leaving You must fight this mage and win She is fairly powerful so a good solution is to send William up to her so that she is in his zone of control i e
he is facing her so that she cannot cast any spells Then use Aren to finish her off with a spell or two
After this make your way to the secret exit which previously had bars over it but the leader opened it when he went to make his escape from the Imperial Guards which stormed the Headquarters From this point you must find the Consort
Start by going to Ganath and ask about Kaleth at the Pearl Spittoon have some Halder's Brew with you you can find some in the hole located just outside where you escaped the Shepard's Headquarters or buy it in Ligano or find it in a hut in Brikal
He will tell you to go see Lokath in Choth He is located in front of the inn As a test for you he will tell you to deliver supplies to Birge in Imazi
Go to Birge in Imazi he is in front of Lord Garson's House and he will tell you that they are trying to overthrow Lord Garson but that they can't get in Click on the hole that they started digging and you will come up with the idea for the Montari to tunnel under the moat Go see Chee the Gold Montari in the Montari cave system located east of Sortiga
Then go back to Imazi and talk to Birge He will send you back to Lokath with a report on your performance Lokath will then send you to Kaleth He is located just outside of town surrounded by tents they look like stones He gives you a potion for swamp walking and tells you to meet up with his men and get the consort
His men are located just south of Darvi and I do mean just south Give them the potion and you will find the consort in a cabin that is right there in the swamp
This ends Chapter This chapter again returns us to Kaelyn and Raal This time the goal is to join up with William and Aren and the Consort To make life easy and quick just journey to Durst and take a carriage to Isten If you try to walk it you will find out that the bridge is out and it's a whole hassle to go the long way Just pay for it and live with it money isn't all that important anyway
Before you leave Isten stop and pick up a Rope and Oil Then travel on the road to the east At the juncture of the three roads to Teal to Durst and to Isten you will find William and Aren and the Consort You have to come up with a distraction for the mercenaries in the area so that they can get the consort to Antara
This is how you do it join the rope and the oil times It will create explosive flasks of them Go up to the individual mercenary groups i e
there are of them and use the flasks i e go to the inventory click on them once and then click on the hand in the lower right corner and then click on a mercenary When you do that to all groups the way will be clear and Kaelyn will say so After that simply go to the gates of Antara At this point the chapter is over Chapter After the Consort and the Princess are taken by the Wraith you are set loose to find the culprit This part of the journey takes place in the northeast corner of the map
The goal here is simple get to Nathby You need to find out as much as you can about Gregor You start out in Breland A big hint go to the store there and buy Fidali Leaves and Senwater In Nathby go to the docks and talk to the captain of the ship that sank He sends you to talk to Poul at one of the inn's there he's in the Lusty Maiden He will tell you about a woman in Beluckre named Misha who runs the local Brothel She will tell you about Gregor only if you get her sencream At the local mercantile store they tell you that they are waiting for the ingredients for the sencream before they can make more Go to the inn at Beluckre and buy some fatty meat Take this and the Fidali Leaves and Senwater to the merchant Give all three items to the man and he will mix you a jar of sencream Take this to Misha and she will give you the key to Gregor's room in Havesly
Next journey to Havesly There are several things to do in Havesly First go to the Mantigua Holding Company There you will examine Lord Sheffields books
Next go to the tailor After that talk to the lighthouse keeper and then go to the lighthouse where you will get two interesting letters After that go talk to Lord Sheffield After you talk to him go to the inn there Talk to the bartender and hand him the key that Misha gave you again while your talking to him go to the inventory screen and drag the key onto the man above the food and burlas He will let you into Gregor's room After you read the information in the book go back and talk to Lord Sheffield You never actually get that far as everyone at the castle has been killed Chapter Chapter Nine the last Chapter of BIA begins with an invasion of pirates The pirates have captured Sheffield Manor and they have been merciless killing everyone except for the Sheffields themselves who are hiding in the locked cellar Your first task is to find the cellar key This is on the top floor in a unlocked untrapped chest just south of the northwestern staircase Return downstairs and use this key to unlock the portcullis in the northeastern corner Once downstairs locate the Sheffields in the far southeast segment of the cellar They will clear up most of the mysteries in the game
After the events in the cellar come to a head you must pursue the Sheffield mage Bryce into his lair in the Wastes Before you attempt this rest fully and buy plenty of food torches and Senwater You must also have some rope Don't be stingy with your money this is the end of the game and you can't take it with you The entry to Bryce's den is behind Sheffield Manor in a cave system Enter the caves making sure to save your game in case you forget something you need later In the first section of the cavern you will encounter deep pits that prevent forward movement You can shimmy across these by clicking on them with a length of rope
Pursue this tactic until you find Bryce's study which is in the northern part of the caves Once in Bryce's study open the chest you find a corner of the room Within is Bryce's diary complete with details of his diabolical master plan The diary also explains the method behind summoning a Wraith from Etherea Study this magic but don't worry about obtaining any of the ingredients since they will be provided for you when there is a need Exit Bryce's study through the passage to the north which deposits you in the Wastes
Here you will have to face lots of nasty fire breathing Hellhounds which fortunately are all cursed with bad aim Bryce expects visitors and is laying in wait You can find an entrance to his lair in the center of the Wastes at the north of a vast canyon Once in his lair you will find him to the northeast The spell Spelunker's Star will help you enormously here Once you locate Bryce he will set you against some pet Hellhounds and then turn on you himself Bryce and his party are using a Carluda's Chain which distributes damage evenly among them This is really to your advantage since it means you don't have to kill Bryce directly The key to this battle is to prevent Bryce from casting his devastating spells
Keep him occupied by attacking him physically at all times When Bryce is vanquished you have almost completed the game Follow the wounded Bryce into his workroom which is behind the nearby door Inside Bryce will die after a few bitter comments about the Imperial Shadows Now you must summon back the Wraith that stole the souls of the Emperor's daughter and her Consort and convince it to return them Open the chest located in the bottom left corner of the screen Then add the following ingredients to the cauldron in this order Senwater Nudberries TrKaa Feather Talicor Dust Hardening Fluid The spell is then complete and the game is at an end CONGRATULATIONS

Commentary and Walkthrough by Soren Andersen Commentary Beyond Atlantis or Atlantis as it is also known is a very satisfying game for the most part
It is a long game the story line is not outlandish for an Adventure game the graphics are very good indeed and a good share of the puzzles are solvable without help but very likely not all of them
The spoken dialog is understandable which is frequently not the case in many games and the option of having it printed as well heard is a big plus as is having background music sound effect volume and dialog volume all separately adjustable
Cursors are few in number and are informative
Something must be said about saving games a procedure that here is like no other you are likely to encounter in computer gaming
When you click on the Save Game button and give the OK your game is saved at that point but you are not allowed an entry that describes where you are in the game
The only identification recorded is the date and time from the computer clock and you will not see this until you click on the Load Game button at which point the times of all your saved games appear sequentially along with a non unique thumbnail picture for each giving a very general idea where you were in the game at that Save Game time
Here is what you might do when you start saving games keep a listing of them giving each one a sequential number and a descriptive name and saving a space for the time to be entered
Then when at some time you wish to load a saved game you will see the sequential time listing of the saved games and you can enter these times in your descriptive listing so that you will have a cross referenced record for your saved games
Because you will be saving games frequently you should do this you know you will shortly have a long and growing list and other than trial and error using your descriptive name to find the time in your Load Game listing will be the only way that you can select any saved game that you want to bring up
Even though it is something of a chore to keep a good record of your saved games do so often
Beyond Atlantis relies heavily on conversation between you and the many characters that you encounter
When you click on one of these persons a series of query squares usually appears next to him each square showing a person or item about which you need to inquire
The walkthrough usually instructs you to ask everything that you can but this should be a routine that you do without being so advised
You should realize from the start that a question and answer are frequently necessary to set flags in the program so that subsequent actions will occur or that new queries will appear
However there are inconsistencies occasionally encountered in the many times that this process is employed
Normally when you click on one of the query squares when done with it the intensity of the displayed square diminishes but this is not always the case
You can click on any square bright or diminished at any time in order to repeat the questioning if you wish to review what has been revealed though you may not get the full Q amp A series of the original
On a rare occasion this repetition is necessary for game continuation
The repetition does no harm and you can step through any query quickly by clicking the mouse
It is better to perform these repetitions than to miss something required for game progression and about which you are unaware
In addition to the above considerations there are a couple others
When you again meet one of these characters after the first time and wish to question them some more all of the initial query squares may not show up so be sure to consider them all at first and any new ones that appear
It may happen that when there are several query squares and depending upon the order in which you access the squares the questioning process my terminate before you get to them all though this is rare
Questioning the goddess Aine is one
You have no warning of this you could save your game before you think it might happen or you will have to go back to the last of the games that you have so frequently been saving
The hokey character of the ending of this game is pretty standard for Adventure games but a completely satisfactory conclusion is seldom found in these games
The several abrupt transitions are somewhat unsatisfactory one example that of being in a monastery and the next moment being underwater on a strange elementary craft that rises flies then goes underwater again
There are too many instances where what is required has no resemblance to a reasonable consequence
Another example you must be in an unindicated location monastery room place one of sixteen items all of which you may not have star in a place that is not exactly to be expected window
And worst of all puzzle solutions with clues too cryptic to be deciphered
As a Balmoral review put it Several 'unfair' puzzles have solutions with no connection to the clues you are given to solve them
The story line while as stated above is not outlandish is still labored and disjointed as presented in the game booklet from the CD jewel case and by Rhea upon encountering her when you get to Shambala
You must listen carefully to the first interchange at the start of the game in the ship Atlante between Ten the protagonist and the wise man the keeper of the crystal
Ten is to journey to Shambala and beyond and the road he must travel is broken into six sections
He is given triangular stones that are the keys to three of the journeys you will subsequently learn that in each of the three scenarios he in the persona he is given performs what may be described as a good deed that earns him another stone for the rest of the journey
Finally he goes to Shambala but that is not yet the end
The walkthrough that follows is quite detailed and although it is not always the case effort is made to have this detail indicate what you should do to get answers not the answers per se
Included at the end of the walkthrough are several diagrams and illustrative screen shots scan them to see what has been included
Some are helpful aids others are spoilers but so is the walkthrough of which they are a part so be hereby so warned and use them at your own discretion
Only one is specifically referenced in the walkthrough but places in the action for the others to be consulted will be readily recognized
Walkthrough When the game begins you are Ten the Bearer of Light struggling through the deep snows of Tibet toward the ship Atlante however strange that might be a sailing ship in the Tibetan mountains and somehow suspended above the snows
When you reach it click on it to go aboard and then go below
From the top of a barrel next to the steps pick up a triangular gray stone with a distinctive white pattern the first of three that you will need
Move to the opening in the wall on the right and look through to glimpse the planetarium that is the key to your several journeys
Move toward it to get a better look and a wise man sitting in a corner of the room speaks to you
Ignore him for the moment
Go a step closer to the planetarium and turn left to find under a desk another triangular stone with a different pattern of white markings
Move closer still to the planetarium and you may acquire an unpatterned triangular stone that is under the hammock to the right
Keep track of where you got each stone
Next examine the planetarium
Run your cursor over it and you will find seven hotspots one by each of the six yellow pointers around the perimeter and one in the center
Starting with bottom yellow pointer number them clockwise from to and refer to the center hotspot as position
This walkthrough is based on the foregoing triangular transporter stone acquisition and planetarium hotspot designation
Now turn to the restless wise man and talk to him as much as you can to learn more of the story that propels this game
During this interchange he gives you a sphere that he calls a crystal
Pay close attention to what he tells you and remember it
A repetition of this conversation is not out of order
After your exchange with him is concluded you must place in the planetarium one of the triangular stones that you have in inventory so that you may make one of the journeys about which the wise man spoke
The first stone you picked up from the barrel takes you to a Mayan city the last stone you acquired from under the hammock takes you to China and the other from under the desk takes you to Ireland
It really doesn't matter which you first choose because you must use all of them in whatever order you wish
The China trip may well be the easiest and the Mayan one perhaps the most difficult
The choice is yours
China From inventory put the unpatterned triangular stone that you got from under the hammock into the planetarium on the hotspot next to yellow pointer
You will be transported to China at some time in the past appearing in the courtyard of a Tao shih temple the Abode of the Purple Deposit
Here you are Wei Yulan a government official
You are on business for the Emperor and you must be on your way but when you try to go out the temple gate a shadow click on it outside it will not let you pass
At the side of the temple courtyard you can see an old man who may be a source of information
When you talk to him however other than his name all he tells you is that you may not leave the temple because a shadow is just outside the gate and will not let anyone out which you have already discovered
Enter the temple and look around
There is a nervous man seated at a table in the first room to the left
Talk to him to find out that he is Master Lo the abbot in charge of this temple
He attributes the shadow as well as the region being overrun with unhappy ghosts end escaped demons to a mysterious star that shines day and night a phenomenon that can be seen in all the places to which you travel
You and Master Lo have a very long exchange during which he accepts with seeming equanimity that all in the temple will probably die of thirst because no one can get past the shadow to the temple well that is outside the gate
You find out more about Master Wu the old man outside and also about the immortal Tan Yun a master exorcist who could undoubtedly dispatch the shadow but who disappeared years ago yet is somewhere in the temple
There is no one left but you to try to find him and Master Wu can direct you
Go talk to him again
Wu tells you to meet him in the Turtle Chamber
Lo tells you that this is the room with the lake
You must find this chamber within the temple and in looking for it you may well encounter a man who speaks nothing but proverbs however you can ignore him
When you enter the room across from him Master Wu is already there standing in a corner
He warns you as did Master Lo that many have tried to make the journey to find Grand Master Tan Yun and none have returned
He says that you must establish directions and travel to the House of the Tiger
Since you are determined to try the journey he states that you will need the black turtle and the engraved medallion that he gives you
Go forward twice and then right to stand next to the large pot in the center of the room
Put the turtle in the water at the center of the pot
This must be the lake about which Lo told you
The turtle is headed away from you
Click on Wu then on the query square that appears containing the turtle
Wu tells you the turtle swims toward the mountain the plain at his tail to his right the pagoda to his left the river
You will find that clicking on the rim of the pot at either side will cause the rim to rotate
Click the engraved medallion on the rim icon at the turtle's tail and you will see a closeup of all four colored rim icons
Examination will show that while three of the icons contain a mountain the red one is differentiated because it does not have a pagoda
If you move the rim so the red one is at the top and the turtle swims towards it the green one will be at the bottom and this one has no mountain thus the plain is at the turtle's tail
In summaryThe red icon at the top represents the mountain The green icon at the bottom represents the plain The yellow icon on the right represents the pagoda The white icon on the left represents the riverClick on Wu then on the medallion query square
Wu says the turtle leaves the lake and travels the path to the House of the Tiger
Click on Wu again then on the medallion query square to tell Wu you are ready to travel
You must move along the grid lines on the floor
Wu says that facing in the direction of the mountain the turtle leaves the lake and immediately finds himself at a crossroads
Go around the pot to where the floor grid crosses next to the pot figurehead
Click once more on the medallion query square and follow Wu's directions to the House of the Tiger
Wu then says to take the shortest path to the House of the Dragon
This house is behind the adjacent wall covered by the dragon mural and the door to it is by the dragon's head so move there
Master Wu signs off and the dragon door opens
In the House of the Dragon there is a miniature lake with a swimming amphibian and several arrays of candles around the walls
Move to the chest on the left in the rear and from this nested set of boxes get a wand
Cross the room to stand within a group of four colored incense candles
You will be standing on a light greenish yellow figured area looks like plastic on which there are several hotspots
Face the wall and use the wand to light the candle on your right
Turning clockwise light the other three candles which causes you to spectacularly shrink a lot
Now walk toward the lake and you are suddenly outside ready to cross a bridge into a bright landscape with trees that have lavender foliage
Go over the bridge and go along the path as far as you can then turn left and face an arch from which chains suspend a horizontal timber with a wheel behind it and five pegs along the front
From the ground pick up the five statues and the bag of money
Return to and enter the House of the Dragon where you are back on the greenish yellow figured area
It does not have any bearing on the game but if you look toward the lake you will see that the amphibian that appeared to be swimming in the water is actually above it
Turn left from the lake then move forward and you will regain your original size
Now you must place the statues and the moneybag on the hotspots that are on the greenish yellow figured area bounded by the incense candles
If you place a statue on a hotspot where it does not belong you can pick it up again but if it belongs you cannot retrieve it
Having made these placements walk toward the lake to shrink again whereupon the statues become animate and all five have something for you if you pay them
Fortunately the moneybag contains five coins so click the coins on each statue in turn and in exchange for one coin you will get a disk along with a cryptic remark about the identifying pattern on the disk
Examine these disks in inventory or better yet look at them in the screen shot provided where the details are better seen
The disk from the woodsman the man with the ax is covered with either water waves or fish scales the disk from the woman water bearer has within it some Chinese mountains the disk from the cook the short man holding a frypan and using chopsticks to eat moths has the appearance of a bronze coin the disk from the lady by the wall carrying a walking stick shows a dragon the disk from the smith shows wood grain
Making a couple of associations dragons with fire and mountains with earth and ruling out fish scales as unlikely the disks represent the five elements offeng shui or geomancy the ancient Chinese art or pseudoscience of creating a harmonic balance in nature
The five elements are metal water wood fire and earth
One of the very basic precepts offeng shuiis that these elements can interact with each other in either a creative or a destructive cycle Feng shuireferences explain the creative cycle as follows condensation on metal leads to water water is required to grow wood burning wood yields fire the ashes from fire go to earth and ore from the earth is smelted to give metal
The destructive cycle is that metal will cut or saw wood wood decays to earth earth will make water dirty water puts out fires fire can melt metal
From the foregoing the creative arrangement of adjacent disks is Metal Water Wood Fire Earth and the destructive arrangement of adjacent disks is Metal Wood Earth Water Fire Applying the above precepts to the statements made by the figures when you bought their disks will reinforce the disk identities
The woodsman stated It fashions wood the second of the creative precepts says that water is required to grow wood and the water disk was sold by the woodsman
The lady with the walking stick said Water drowns it the fourth destructive precept and clearly indicating her fire disk
The smith says It engenders fire but is later eaten by metal these being the third creative precept and the first destructive one this is the wood disk
The cook states It creates water but is later consumed by fire these being the first creative precept and the fifth destructive one both applying to metal the disk from him
The water bearer says Metal is born of it wood later destroys it the first statement being the fifth creative precept and applies to earth the disk from this woman but the second part of her statement does not seem to be any of the precepts
Move toward the lake to go back outside across the bridge and to the end of the path where you will see before you an open drawbridge
Turn left to the timber with the five pegs on it
Put the disks on the pegs in the creative cycle order if they are in the correct arrangement the wheel behind the timber will turn and the drawbridge will lower half way
If this does not happen remove the first disk move the other four forward and put the removed disk on the peg at the end
Repeat this process until the bridge moves
Then do the same thing using the destructive arrangement of disks and you will get bridge fully lowered
Cross the lowered bridge to the gate with the golden doors
Click on the hunter to have the arrow point to him then move your cursor to the top of either of the doors to open them
Enter the strange dragon turn left and move forward
On the left is a simple puzzle in which you click on one of the five clouds on in the top panel to raise the five clouds below
Do this when the snake is not moving
When you raise the last of the lower clouds you get a pearl
Go into the engine room in the dragon's head turn around and put the pearl into the hole in the brass plate on the wall
A rather amusing video is initiated wherein the dragon flies you to an island on which there is a house with a red door built up against a very large rock
Each time that you try to enter the house through the red door you end up turned around facing the dragon
Try the door twice to be sure
The only other avenue of movement is around the house to the right
When you go there you find a large blank panel in the side of the house
Nothing for you there
Back to the front to try the red door once more and Grand Master Tan Yun appears on the lawn beside the house
There are several query boxes and you should have a long conversation during which he produces a door in the blank panel on the side of the house
He will provide you with what you need to exorcise the shadow at the temple gate if you bring him the mushroom of immortality which he tells you is in Hell
Hell it seems is the red building
Go around the building to the door that Tan made in the panel and enter the building
The interior contains many pillars and wood partitions within a square stone enclosure
At the doorway is an officious bored clerk to question and from whom you can get a blank form that you must get stamped in order to get the mushroom
When you have finished talking to him and have obtained the blank form you must travel through the place until you find a young girl holding a fox mask on a stick
She tells you that you saved her life this was done when you pointed the arrow on the golden gate at the hunter rather than at the fox
She gives you a fan on which are three images
These are the stamps that you must get on your form from three of the six clerks in various locations in Hell and are different each time you play the game
You must locate the particular three clerks so that you can get your form stamped with the proper images and in the correct order
As you move around you will see that some of the clerks are on the ceiling
There is a curious vertical symmetry about the place in that should it be inverted and you were walking on what presently the ceiling it would look pretty much the same
There is a set of stairs in one of the stone walls where you can do just that and you can then get any needed stamp from a clerk on the ceiling
When your form has the three stamps in the correct order return to the clerk by the door to get the mushroom
Exit Hell go to the front door of the house and then to Tan Yun
Ask him the full set of questions before you hand over the mushroom
He tells you to put the serpent on the shadow then remove it
He then disappears in a puff of smoke leaving behind a Chinese lantern for your inventory
Go back into the dragon and remove the pearl from the brass plate in the engine room wall
Immediately replace it and fly back to the original island
Go through the golden doors across the bridges and into the building the House of the Dragon
Move off the statue area to regain your original size
Have you been miniaturized all this time
Leave the House of the Dragon and go through the turtle room to the temple hallway
Upon stepping into the hallway a concluding video begins in which the shadow is exorcised you receive the thanks of the abbot and a triangular stone is returned to you by Master Wu
You are transported back to the wise man on the ship Atlante
A glowing green triangular stone is now in position of the planetarium in place of the one that you put there to start your journey and which is now back in your inventory
The wise man may have a new query square
Click on the green triangular stone in the planetarium by yellow pointer and you will find yourself back in front of the entrance to the Abode of the Purple Deposit
Go in and back to the turtle room
Go to the far left corner and walk in the direction of the mountain along the path that is one removed from the wall
Click on the dragon and the dragon door will appear as before
In the Dragon Room step on the area with the statues and move toward the pond in order to become small then go outside and on to the golden gate
Click the spherical crystal from the wise man on the left side of the gate structure and move it around until the lines within it become pulsing red
Left click your mouse and you will travel to the far side of the moon
Click on the earth to return to the golden gate
Find your way back to the temple courtyard where there is a striker mallet leaning against the near leg of the gong
Pick up the mallet strike the gong and you will return to the ship Atlante
Ireland From your inventory put the triangular stone that you got from under the desk into the planetarium on the hotspot next to yellow pointer
You will be transported to a monastery on an island in Ireland at an unspecified time in the distant past
Here you are the monk Brother Felim illustrating a manuscript
The abbot Brother Liam is talking to you during which a cry of distress is heard
The abbot sends you outside to investigate
Go through the chapel then through the next room that is here called a porch and ahead along the path through the gate
Turn left and try to talk to Brother Finbar the source of the outcry but you get no intelligible reply
Return to report to the abbot
When passing through the porch look to see the weeping head that is in the wall to the left but DO NOT click on it or you will be transported back to the ship Atlante
Talk to the abbot about Finbar and about the weeping head then turn your attention to the large open book on the bookstand
Get a closeup of the illustration then pick up a brush from the cup above the book
Click the brush on the illustration and you will be transported into the book
You will see a blue man and you must find your way to the front of him so that you may talk to him
He is Dian a physician and craftsman and the brown statue near him is his ensorcelled daughter Airmid
Ask him about everything and it is to be hoped you can follow the Gaelic
Go over to the king and click on him until he repeats himself
Go back to Dian then go right and look for the wordexiton the wall manuscript fragment
Click on that and return to the monastery
It is now your task to find the glass tower and King Nuada's sword
Start exploring everywhere and examining everything
On the way out of the chapel something in the bookcase on the right of the door to the porch catches your eye
Inventory says it is a piece of a skull
When you get outside go around to the left and examine the two runic markings on the chapel wall
Go through the gate past poor moonstruck Brother Finbar and continue on down the path to the arch of stones that is before the earthen mound
Go inside to find a part of a skull
This must be the grave of Ailill killed by the weeping Aine about which the abbot told you
Click the bone fragment you found in the bookcase on the skull
It fits
You need more fragments
Leave the grave and turn left to start walking around the monastery island
After three clicks you should see a fox lying in a shallow shelter
For no good reason click on him so that he runs away
After he disappears you will hear the sounds of chickens
Follow the fox and you will soon come upon three grazing sheep
Look carefully at the base of one of the boulders and you will find a jawbone
Go back to Ailill's grave taking the high path on the left
Just before you get to the grave did you see the horse carved in one of the stones
Take a look at it
Go into the grave and add the jawbone to the skull
Leave and at the grave entrance turn right
Go to the area behind the grave between it and the sea where you will find four beehives
In the entrance to one of these is yet another skull fragment
After you add this piece to the skull go up the hill to Brother Finbar
Go behind him and through the entrance to the small walled area and get a hayfork that is lying on the ground
Return to the churchyard and from the gate go to the left toward the shelters built into the hill
In the first of these you can get a hard to find black pitcher
The abbot is sitting out here by a third one of these shelters seemingly not very concerned about Brother Finbar
Talk to the abbot
He'll tell you again about Ailill and Aine and when you ask him about the Standing Stone he will give you a key
You can use it immediately to open a small chest on the ground to the right from which you get a knife and a parchment
Click on the parchment and you will see drawings of several different trees along the top and below each a rune associated with it
Click on the abbot to ask about the parchment then click the parchment on him to have him identify the individual tree representations as you point them out
Note the resemblance to one of the runes
Now go the well where a chicken is pecking away
At the base of the well where it is pecking you can find another piece of skullbone had you not rousted the fox you would not find it
You can see a ladder leaning against the building
Climb it and look down into the chapel through a hole in the roof
Atop the large cross you can see one more bone fragment as your cursor will attest but you can't reach it
Drag the hayfork across it to dislodge it then climb down and go into the chapel to get it from where it has fallen on the floor
While you are up on the roof you may wish to look around for a view of the island
Return to Ailill's grave where these last two bone pieces will complete the skull which will undergo some startling transformations and end up a human head presumably Ailill's
When you try to talk to him all you get in reply is grunts
Go to the weeping head in the porch and fill the black pitcher with tears
Return and click this on the head and it is no longer mute but it is cryptic
He says an evil force is abroad and that you will have to ride the white horse
He also wants the knife
Well you have that
Give it to him and whatever it is that he says presumably more Gaelic must put a spell on it because when you get it back it is glowing
He says it is ready for the trees
Click on him to find out who he is and how he died and about the runic markings
He says they are ready for the knife
Go back now to the two runic markings on the chapel wall
Since Ailill has said the knife is ready for the trees and the trees are ready for the knife save your game and see what the knife will do to the three runic trees
You will have noted references to the Standing Stone though it does not seem to be identified
The abbot says he knows nothing about it except that it is very ancient
When he was shown the tree parchment he said that there had been an oak tree and an elder tree growing beside the Standing Stone
This is your clue look at these two trees on the parchment
There are three tree runes but only two are referenced
Remove all the branches from one of the trees and make the other two look like the oak and elder runes
Then click the knife on the spiral rune and the wall slab on which the runes have been carved lowers into the ground
On the ground behind it is a stick
That's all a small stick
Must be important pick it up
With Ailill's statements about a horse and a stone in mind go to the carving of the horse on the stone near the entrance to his grave
Hit the carving with your newly acquired stick and the horse will come off the stone and gallop away
Now all you have to do is find and catch it
Go to the grave entrance then past it one click toward the beehives
Wait for the horse to appear from behind the hives and come up to you
When he stops put him in your inventory
Walk down to the shore where there are a lot of poles in the water
Put the horse in the water and see him change from a small gray animal to a great white stallion
When he has settled down mount him for an exciting video ride across the surface of the sea through a storm
The horse deposits you on another small island
This is bleak Birdman Island where all the trees are dead and bare
Walk ahead until you find the Birdman sitting in a tree
When you try to talk to him he answers with a birdcall
Then there appears a column of six birds and when you move the cursor on and off each one you get a different birdsong
Click on the one that matches the Birdman's call if you make a mistake you hear a raucous jaylike birdcall
When you have made three consecutive matches which might take a while he flies sort of out of the tree
Question him as much as you can try to find out about the glass tower
He tells you that it is not on the ground nor above the ground so he gives you a forked stick a divining rod to look below the ground
Go to the area in front of the remnant of curved wall and move the cursor around until it indicates a hotspot on the ground then click the divining rod on that
The ground trembles rocks fall and a well appears
There is nothing else but dive down the well to look for the glass tower
When you do that you can see it down there but you can't get to it because some sort of aquatic monster is guarding it
Come back up and talk to Fintan the Birdman again
He refers you to Airmid daughter of Dian
So mount the horse and ride back to the monastery
Return to the chapel and the big book that you were illustrating
The man in red at the right of the page is now a hotspot
Run your brush over him and a drawing of a sword will appear next to him
If it does not you may have to enter the book and talk to the king then come back out try again
Enter the book and talk again to Dian the blue man
Be sure and ask him once more about Airmid and question the new query squares then go and talk to King Nuada
Take his sword exit the book and go talk to Ailill in his grave
Ask him about everyone but himself about Fintan and Airmid
He speaks of Aine and the old sun spinning across the sky he must do this
The Abbot Brother Liam is still sitting by the well in the churchyard
Go talk to him
Ask him about the old sun spinning across the sky after which he gives you an ancient cross Brigid's Cross
Ask him about that
Enter the chapel again and regard the large wall tapestry
There are several hotspots on it where you could place Brigid's Cross but it will properly only go in one of them in the sky where it becomes the spinning old sun
When you find this correct place the goddess Aine appears
Ask her everything and at one of your replies to a question of hers she will remove the curse from Airmid
Enter the book once more and talk to Airmid who is no longer a statue
Ask her everything
She wants her salmon that was taken from her
Exit the book and click your brush on the girl on the left in the illustration
A fish appears in her hands
Enter the book and talk to Airmid click on the salmon query square again
She has now had her salmon returned and has made from it an amulet that will help you get the glass tower
With the fish now in inventory go from the book to the shore where your white steed is waiting to take you back to Birdman Island
Dive into the well and use the amulet to make the monster leave so that you can at last get the glass tower from the bottom
Ride back to the chapel enter the book and give the tower to the blue man
He uses some Gaelic to weave some fragility into it
Now use King Nuada's sword to break it and get the silver hand
Give the hand then the sword to King Nuada who will spectacularly dispatch the one eyed monster Bres
Your mission here is done for now
Leave the book and go to the chapel porch where you meet the abbot for the concluding video
Brother Finbar is cured you get the triangular stone back and you are returned to the wise man on the ship Atlante
A glowing green triangular stone is now in the planetarium at position in place of the one that you put there to start your journey and the latter is now back in your inventory
The wise man may have a new query square
Click on the green triangular stone in the planetarium by yellow pointer and you will find yourself back in the monastery
Go down to the seashore for another wild ride on the stallion to Birdman Island
Go to the dead tree on the left of the curving wall ruins and click the crystal from the wise man on the branches
Move it around until the lines in it are a glowing red then click your left mouse button for a trip through space to the far side of the moon
Click on the earth to return
Ride the stallion back to the monastery then click on the weeping face of Aine in the chapel porch to return to Atlante
Check the wise man to see if there any new conversation subjects
City of the Maya From inventory put the triangular stone that you got from the barrel top into the planetarium on the hotspot next to yellow pointer
You will be transported to an unnamed Mayan city state in the distant past which as usual for the Mayans is at war with another city
You arrive in this scenario in an open grassy field where you are Tepic a cousin of the royal family who has just returned from scouting the enemy and has found that the situation is desperate
All will be explained in lengthy conversations soon to follow
Look around
There are many stone buildings prominent among them are two pyramids on either side of a sunken ball court
Go to the set of steps on the left side of the pyramid on the left
Ascend these steep steps where you will be greeted by the king's brother who has aspirations to be king
The fat guy in the fancy headdress is his toady the High Priest of the Jaguar god Tezcatlipoca
Ask each of them all that you can in order to learn the dire happenings that are besetting the city
Go to the other end of the portico enter the pyramid approach the ceremonial fire and talk to the priestess
Ask her all you can then take the bandages she gives you into the building to the king
Give them to him then talk to everyone
As you leave someone will give you the bandages which now have the king's blood on them
Return them to the priestess who prays as she puts them into the fire
The wrong god replies
Click on her again for more conversation
However save the first query square the one in the upper left showing the jaguar for the last question
The priestess will offer to send you on a mission to Xibalba the land of the dead click on her again then on the thumbs up sign to agree to go
A video will take you there and you will have a conversation with the bat god guardian of this place who is hanging upside down on a post
He has three round spots strikingly displayed on a wing with this prominence it must be something to note
Click on the bat to finish all conversation then click on the base of the post from which the bat god is hanging and you will return to the priestess for more conversation
Go now to the pyramid that is across the sunken ball court
Go all the way to the top
There is a fire burning in a vessel which if you click on it will return you to the wise man in the ship Atlante so don't do that
At the bottom of an obelisk there is a square that has a strikingly different color than the rest of the stone approach and click on it and inventory tells you that you have picked up an obsidian foot
Turn around and observe the pattern on the top of the stone altar
It is readily recognized as the big dipper constellation remember the location of the seven stars
Go down the stairs to the first level of the pyramid interior
Explore this level
You will find a guard in front of the stairway down to the next level he will not let you pass but he has a pronouncement The Jaguar's number is the Bat's multiplied by itself
In three corners of the passageways you will find plaques placed on the stone walls
One of these is the Jaguar puzzle that you must solve in order to have guard let you pass the other two are introductions to the Mayan numbering system which you are going to have to learn in order to solve the puzzles in this pyramid
Enough is presented so that you can infer anything additional that is needed
One of these plaques gives the elementary numbering system there are five columns of four squares and below each column are tiny human figures
It is readily evident from this that a dot is a bar is all in the lowest square of a column
They apparently have no symbol for zero luckily you won't need one
The other instructional plaque shows three columns of again four squares below the first are tiny figures below the second are and below the third are
From this you can see that the second tier of squares has a value of for a dot in it
Bars are below the dots
In a third corner is the Jaguar puzzle
It too is a column of four squares here each square has a x matrix of holes to accommodate any arrangement of dots and bars up to that for the maximum decimal number to be represented this would be since is a single dot in the second tier square
On the left side is a cup of balls each representing a and on the right side a cup of sticks each representing a
The guard has told you that the Jaguar's number is the Bat's number squared and you know the bat's number is having noted the three dots on his wing while you were in the land of the dead so the Jaguar's number is
That one is easy a bar and four dot's in the first tier of squares
Take a stick from the right cup and put it across the bottom row of holes in the bottom square then pick up four balls all at once from the cup on the left and put them in the row of holes above the stick
The guard will now let you pass to the next level down
The passageways on this level the second are more complicated than the level above
When you explore them you will find another guard barring the stairway to the third level he announces that The Jaguar's number multiplied by itself is the Snake's
In the corridor opposite him is a plaque with more mathematical instructions another set of three columns of four squares with tiny figures below each column the first set the second set and the third set
Comparing these numbers with the Mayan symbols shows that the value of found for a dot in the second tier of squares is in fact a multiplier
Continue exploring the passageways until you find another puzzle
It is the Snake puzzle and in this one you must put the Mayan the square of the Jaguar's according to the guard
Again pretty simple dots in the second tier is x and a dot in the first tier makes
Put the balls for this arrangement in the first and second tiers of the puzzle and the guard allows you to pass down the stairs to the third level
Move ahead and you will come up against a door
Look to the left and you will see a small square on the wall click on this square and the door opens
In the revealed room is a statue of a crocodile and on the wall in front it is another math illustration
It is the same three columns of four squares as before but there are no tiny human figures on this one because there is not room for them
From what you know already the number represented by the Mayan system in the first column is and you may infer from previous illustrations that the next two columns are then and
With one dot in the third tier of squares in the second column it thus means that the multiplier of that square is
The crocodile puzzle is below the head of the statue
The other inference to make from the foregoing puzzles is that the crocodiles number is the square of the snakes x
The value of a bar in the third tier is x bars there will be
Putting a dot there adds to make it
Putting a bar in the second tier adds x three dots in the same tier adds x and one dot in the bottom tier adds to give the value
Perform this indicated placing of bars and balls and you will be able to get a second obsidian foot from the mouth of the crocodile statue
Move to the wall to your left the one opposite the door you entered and if you look closely you will see two squares that are blacker than the wall your cursor will confirm that you found each of them
Put the obsidian feet in the these two squares thentake them out again
Click on the wall between the squares and you will exit the pyramid with the feet in inventory
Return to the top of the other pyramid and talk to the priestess again
When you have asked all you can some of it repetition click on the formless object on a pole in the corner presumably a bat and you will be returned to the land of the dead
Talk to the bat god again to find out once more what you must do to find the serpent god Quetzalcoatl
First you must build the Rainbow Bridge
Turn left from the hanging bat until your forward movement cursor appears
Click to move ahead then look directly downward to find a hotspot
Click on that and the Rainbow Bridge puzzle appears
This puzzle is a x set of miniature jungle squares with sections of tan path in them these squares must be rearranged to make a continuous path so that the tiny figure in the circle in the lowest square can run around the puzzle gathering blobs of color to make the Rainbow Bridge
You may click on any of the nine squares to pick it up and move it to any of the other eight locations then click to set it down and the square that is replaced moves to the vacated location
You may rotate a square by quarter turns clockwise using the right mouse key
If you want to leave the puzzle to reset it use the Esc key
When you think that you have solved the puzzle by providing the tiny man a complete path to travel the puzzle and reach all the colors to build the bridge click on him to send him on his way to do this
There are strange sounds each time he gets a color blob
If you have made a mistake he will be stopped and you must try again
Here is a hint do not move the lowest square containing the tiny man
This is not an easy puzzle but try to solve it
If you can't do it here is one way to do so along the left diagonal edge slanting like this label the squares from bottom to top X X X the next row to the right from bottom to top Y Y Y the row on the right will be Z Z Z
Move the squares as follows R signifies rotate
Z unchanged
X Z R
Y Z R
Y R
Y y R
X Y
X X R
X R When the puzzle is complete and the tiny man in Z has run the entire path and built the Rainbow Bridge the puzzle disappears and you are back in the jungle on an island having crossed the rainbow bridge and there on your right at the edge of the river is the dugout canoe that the bat god promised
However you do not yet have what you need before you take the canoe out on the river
You must enter the jungle which is in fact a maze where you will have to find seven stars on the ground in several places
A few stars are in plain sight if you look carefully others are partially hidden with a couple that are quite difficult to locate
It is not easy to navigate this maze and find the stars but of course it must be done
It is not a complicated maze but views of jungle foliage tend to be hard to differentiate
There are sixteen nodes where the seven stars might be but there is none with more than one star
When you have collected all seven stars you then need to find a location in the maze where there is an obelisk like the one on the top of the pyramid and very nearby a duplicate of the big dipper altar but with many more holes
Put the black obsidian foot in the obelisk then put the seven stars in the altar top to duplicate the big dipper constellation
With this accomplished another obelisk appears
Put the gray obsidian foot in this new obelisk and the Jaguar God Tezcatlipoca will come out of it and speak to you then the obelisk will turn and Quetzalcoatl will emerge
Talk to him all that you can
In order to get the chulel you need from him you must find and bring to him some skulls that the Jaguar has hidden
He gives you a feather for protection
Take the feather and return through the maze to the dugout canoe
Move out onto the river and paddle six times in either direction it takes twelve strokes to circle the island where across from the island in which is the maze will be the darkest jungle
Enter the jungle and you will come to a giant spider web suspended between the trees
You must take from the spider some insects it has captured in the web
Climb onto the web
You are safe from the spider if you stay at the edge of the web
If you get caught when challenging the spider the result is not mortal you will be thrown off the web and you have to try again
Look for the wedge shaped section of the web that has no webbing in it and get to the left of it
Move toward the spider to entice it to come toward you then turn around go back to edge of the web cross to the right of the clear web section that the spider can't cross and head for the center of the web to get the caterpillar that is captured there
Pick it up and move quickly to the edge of the web and jump off
You must do this once more to get another insect
Proceed as you did before but this time when you get to the right of the clear web section you can't run for the insect because there is another spider in the center of the web as well as the one to your left
Go toward the second one to entice it toward you then go to the right and then to the edge of the web
Walk all around the web until you are again to the right of the empty section
If you look back you will see that one spider is on the edge looking at you the other is facing the edge of the web on the left side of the clear section
Go one more step around the web past the clear section and both will be on the edge chasing you but you can outrun them to the web center to get the other insect
Scoot out to the edge of the web and jump off
Now that you have both insects go back to the canoe and go to the right on the river for three paddle strokes then go into the jungle three steps opposite the island and there you will find a big frog
This is Chac
Give the two insects to Chac in return for which you will get two cryptic statements that do not seem to have much real relevancy one refers to an occurrence that has already happened
Return to the canoe and back to the spider web
This time when you climb to the web the spider is a bigger edition of the other two who if you click on her states that they are her daughters
Behind her you can see two skulls in the center of the web
You should have entered the web at a section that is one to the right of the clear one
Put the green feather from the serpent god on the edge of the web to the right of the clear section where it changes to a translucent button
Go look at it then immediately cross to the other side of the clear section
Now toward the center of the web you can see a sword
Get it and whack the spider with it
You can do this as often as you wish but she recovers each time
Once is adequate however and apparently she is confused enough that if you act quickly you can grab the skulls run to the edge and jump off
It's back to the boat and paddle the six strokes to get to the maze entrance
Either way you go at the sixth stroke your cursor gives you two choices to move ahead take the one next to the island
Go through the maze to the obelisk with the serpent god and give him the skulls
In a short remarkable video he makes a joint skullful of this mysterious chulel
Take it and return to the canoe
Go onto the river and left one paddle stroke
Go ashore and talk to the bat god then click on the base of the bat's post to return to the priestess in the pyramid
She tells you to take the chulel to the king
Enter the king's chamber and try to contain yourself during a very contrived mawkish ending to this scenario during which the priestess makes you a gift of a triangular stone
You are then returned to the wise man on Atlante
A glowing green triangular stone is now in position of the planetarium in place of the one that you put there to start your journey and which is now back in your inventory
The wise man may have a new query square
Click on the green triangular stone in the planetarium by yellow pointer and you will be returned to the field by the pyramids
Go to the steps of the king's pyramid then turn back so you can see the tree beyond the building to the right
Click the crystal from the wise man on the branches of this tree and move it until the lines inside it are red
Then left click your mouse and you will go for a space trip to the other side of the moon
Click on the earth to return
Move to the other pyramid across the field and beyond the ball court
Climb to the top and click on the firepot to get back to Atlante
Space The space trips around the moon after completing each of the China Ireland and Mayan tasks may be regarded as preliminary or practice runs and you must now make an extended space trip that will modify the spherical crystal the wise man gave you
Go above deck on the ship and face forward
Put the crystal on the bow so that the lines within it turn pulsing red then click the left mouse and you will go to the far side of the moon as before
This time swing to the right a short distance and click on the bright star the sun
for passage to its hot molten core
Click on the right edge of the core to move around it and then off into space to stop in a group of asteroids
Move slightly right and head for the larger of a star pair
You then stop hovering in space surrounded by near stars of varying brightness and with the starry firmament in the background
If you look at the crystal in your inventory you will find that it has changed from a sphere to a multifaceted shape with a hexagonal outline the transformation probably occurring when you went through the space cloud and the warbling sound was heard
This was the object of this space tour so you can now return to Atlante
Swing a little to the left and the cursor will tell you that you can move into some greenish brown space mist which will take you back to the asteroids
Turn past the double star and click on the yellow brown planet to go beyond the molten star core and observe anther planet in the distance
Click on this planet and return to the moon and thence to earth and the deck of the ship
Return below deck to the planetarium
Place the three stones from inventory onto the three vacant planetarium hotspots by the and yellow pointers
Each stone will go into only one of the positions but you must note the succession in which you place them
They become the same brilliant green of the other three stones and all six stones have different filigreed markings
Put the transformed crystal in the center of the planetarium and you will see a video of Ten jumping into another sort of space to emerge from the bottom of a vortex and land in a lotus where he is surrounded by six large red curtains each having a different one of the same filigree markings as the green stones in the planetarium
Should you click on a curtain a small white ball emerges from a lotus in front of it and does continuous figure eights in the air but you should not do this at random
The game gives no apparent indication of what you are to do next so here it is in order to send Ten to Shambala you must click on three of the curtains in the proper sequence and this is to be done twice
The curtains to be used in the sequence are the ones whose patterns match the original three stones that you acquired and have just placed in the planetarium
The curtains have folds in them so the patterns are distorted and the curvature of the stones hides some of the edges of the patterns thus you might experience some difficulty in making a match
The sequence in which you click on the curtains is that in which you placed the last three stones in the planetarium
Correctly done Ten is drawn back up through the vortex and lands in Shambala
If the matching of the curtain and stone patterns proves difficult a trial and error solution should not take long since only three curtains are involved
You can click on the swirling stars above for a reset in which case Ten is drawn back up through the vortex to the planetarium so that he can jump in again and you can try a different sequence of curtains
Shambala This is a strange place
It appears to be two small islands floating in air under a sunny though cloud filled sky
Move from the island on which you arrived to the other one nearby which has a pond where fish are swimming above the water surface
Go toward the tree with the lavender foliage then keep moving around the edge of the pond to come upon a lady Rhea sitting on a rock waiting to talk to you
Click on her for many query boxes to appear and for a long rather enigmatic conversation with her as she attempts to tell you what is and has been happening
After the completion of her somewhat tortured tale return along the pond edge almost to the lavender tree then leave over two rocks and begin a series of short visits to many of the places that you have been before in the course of the game
In each of the places you are to look for an item that has figured in the story though not one with the location in which you find yourself
The sequence of these visits is pseudo random and will include much repetition unless you find the different exits among the ones at these locations
There may be someone with a message
There are sixteen items to collect but you only need the star of course you can try to get all sixteen if you enjoy looking for them
When you have picked up the star keep sequencing until you are in the Irish monastery room in which is the large book that was so prominent in that scenario
Suggestion if you find yourself in the Mayan king's room click on the opening in the ceiling
Above the book is a window that has two small bottles in it click the star on the window and there will be a somewhat startling noisy video showing Ten being transported by a strange craft to the underwater ruins of Atlantis
Atlantis Apparently Ten has no problem existing under water
Here you must undergo a rather mazelike search for the gates to Atlantis
Your cursor is now a gold ring except for the travel cursor
Keep clicking on the latter when it occurs and be on the lookout for a pair of pillars neither round nor square but a definite pair on the side of the hills that surround the site of the ruins where you have landed
You will recognize them when you see them
Go through the pillars and look for a large crystal two clicks to the right
When you click on it it enters your cursor ring
Now you must find the so called octopus a black sphere with many tentacles
To find it look for a portico with a stylized tentacle on the wall behind the pillars
When you find it save your game and turn right to view the octopus
You must attack this creature by clicking the crystal on the base of the active tentacle to cut it off and the active one keeps changing
The crystal must be in an energized state to do this as indicated by its being bright and which takes a moment
The way to attack is to keep rapidly clicking the crystal on the base of a tentacle that you think will be the active one
You can take a number of hits but if the beast overcomes you you will find yourself at the point in which you entered the water after the wild ride from the monastery
You know that you have defeated the octopus when it becomes bright and squirts a cloud of ink at you
The inference of this last bit of action is that the Light as represented by the crystal is wielded by Ten the Bearer of the Light to defeat the Dark which is the black octopus
Endgame You again find yourself back on the ship Atlante and the wise man gives you back your crystal
How did he get it
Place it once more in the center of the planetarium and you are off to the moon again
Follow the same path to the molten core of the bright star to the right of the rotating core to the asteroids to the double star and to the space mist
Now instead of heading into the space mist as you did before swing to the right to find a small black disk surrounded by a bright halo
Click on it to travel to some red clouds turn right to some scarlet clouds in which is an irregular white area
Move through that area to the final video
The conclusions that you draw are your own
GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
The opening movie shows you Ten climbing in the Himalayas
With the guidance of an eagle and some shooting stars you find your way to the Atlant one of the flying ships of the Atlanteans
You are a descendant of Seth and a carrier of Light who saved the world from the forces of darkness after Creon the Queen's Consort released the darkness which had long been imprisoned
Darkness is now under the watchful eye of the people of Shambhala and following a supernova it appears that Light and Darkness are restless and strive to be joined once again
You arrive at Atlant perhaps hoping to fly but the ship is dormant
Make your way below and have a look around
If you turn left atop the barrel is astoneyou can pick up
Take it and go into the next chamber
When you step in the levitating Wiseman speaks and welcomes you When you have exhausted the conversation with the Wiseman you have learned who you are the bearer of light and that you will be looking for the exact place to use your Crystal for further journeys
It already contains one says the Wiseman
If you wish you can take that one journey now that the crystal contains
To do so go above decks on the ship and hold the crystal up toward the bow
See the lines turn red
Click
Wow
How about that
Click on Earth to return
You are urged toremember the path you travel Your ancestors prepared the way long ago and then broke it into six Step forward once toward the hammock
There are two more triangular stones
One is behind you on the floor and the third one is in the far corner under the hammock
Go closeup to the Planetarium and place one of the stones on it I recommend using the stone from the floor behind you the one with the simplest markings first It will take you toIreland
You are quot beamed up quot and into the body of Brother Felim a monk in Medieval Ireland
You bear the marks of the bringer of light on your palm
Suddenly something happens to one of the monks outside Brother Finbar
You go see him and find him dazed unable to speak
What in the world did he see to frighten him so
Have a look at the weeping head in the entryway but don't click on it it takes you back to the Atlant
Go back to the Abbot and talk with him about Finbar and the head
Then return to work on your manuscripts
Pick up abrushfrom the container on top and move close up to the page
Paint on the center and voil you are really getting into your work now
Not to worry this is not a maze that comes later darn it
In the book turn R F hard L Talk to the blue man about everything
He is Dian physician and silversmith
You will need the hand
Talk to the King Nuada
You will need the sword
Exit the book
The Abbot is gone when you come out of the book
You can find him sitting in front of one of the huts near the well
While you are out there visit the other open huts and pick up the ewer water pitcher and go to the weeping face to fill it Have you visited King Ailill's grave
it's an open grave a very old style and not very common any more
His skull is on display there but vandals have broken it and distributed five pieces
You must find them
Here they are in no particular order
For the one atop the cross in the chapel find the hay fork in the garden behind Finbar climb the ladder and look down the hole in the roof to dislodge the skull piece
Then go inside to find it on the floor near the altar For the piece behind the bird near the well you must drive the fox out of his lair
To find the fox start at Finbar
R F right fork and right fork again While you are at the beehive just down the hill from the grave watch the flock of bees by following them all the way around clockwise
Not necessary to do this just to appreciate an amazing bit of programming
Keep going around the island perimeter to find the sheep
F from the fox's lair forward a couple more nodes takes you back to the garden
You can put the five pieces in the skull at any time and in any order
When they are all in place Ailill comes to life after years
He cannot talk at first
quot Uuuugh quot Sort of like me when I've overslept
If you give him water he is refreshed and can speak
He tells of a Force a horse and a stone
What's all that about
And he wants a knife
Let's go find him a knife
When you exit the grave if you go straight out there is a stone with a cross on it
If instead you go around the back of this stone there is a horse and some Druid marks
The horse is a hot spot but nothing happens yet
Maybe the Abbot can help
If he's no help then you haven't peeked around the west side of the chapel
How'd I know it's west
because the shadow must be on the north side
This is Ireland and in the Northern latitudes
Anyway once you go around the side of the chapel to see theDruid markingson the stone wall Brother Abbot will talk about them
Then since you are so clever he gives you a key
Don't travel far the chest it opens is right here down and to the right
Take theknifeand theparchment
Talk to the Abbot about the trees on the parchment
Ask about them from left to right
Notice that he gives you details about three of the trees
The Ash the Oak and the Elderberry were once standing close to the stone or the chapel
Note their Druid symbols
Four to the right two to the left five tilted Then since Ailill wants the knife take it to him
Talk to him about the horse and himself
He tells you how he died and that Aine put a curse on him It's Gaelic pronounced Oh'nya quot it's nice to've known ya quot but he won't tell you why
Must've been something really bad
Show him the knife
He places a Gaelic blessing on the knife
Go to the Druid marks on the Chapel wall
Clicking outside the marks on the right or left changes the position of the marks
Clicking in the center just above the lowest mark erases one mark
So do this Thetopset must match theOakimage
Put the marks on the left and erase the bottom three leaving two pointing left
Themiddleset must match theElderberry
Make them all centered and slanting downward to the right
Thebottomset must be allerased
Delete them from the bottom up
Then the spiral emblem will now open the wall giving you access to thestick Have you found the stone horse yet
TheStanding Stoneis outside Ailill's grave with a cross on one side and the horse on the other
If you have trouble finding it start at the exit from the grave
Go L F R F R Use the stick on the stone horse to release him
Now your problem is to catch the horse
From the Stone turn right F Turn left F turn right toward the beehives and wait to see the horse coming
When he pauses you can pick him up
If you follow the horse or miss picking him up he will go back into the stone and you need to release him again
Turn around to your left and take the stone horse to the beach where the short pilings are and place him in the water
He becomes real
Click on him and he will take you to another island
The reason for creating a saved game is so you can experiment with the puzzle and then return to the same configuration
This puzzle randomizes itself as you work on it making it nearly impossible to repeat anything
When you save a gamewrite down the time and a brief description Saved games can only be identified by the time stamp
CAUTION If you are deaf or tone deaf or quot musically challenged quot you will need a helper or a saved game
I can provide the saved game as long as you are using the same sequence Ireland first then Maya followed by China Go find the birdman sitting on a branch
Click on him and you get to ask him about three subjects himself the horse and Ailill
He chirps a song
He wants you to repeat his song back to him
You have five songs to choose from To listen to the different songs just pass the cursor over the choices without clicking and without hovering
Thebig challengewith this puzzle isrecognizingwhen you've answered right
You need to hear the difference between the quot right quot and quot wrong quot responses from the Birdman
That's thehard part The response he gives when you are incorrect ends with a shrill hawk like tone and the response for a good answer starts with a beep and ends more songlike
Both responses are very short and they come immediately after you make your choice making it difficult to hear them at all
The whole key to getting through this puzzle is learning these two short sounds If the birdman gives you the quot good quot sound you are finished with that conversation segment
Don't ask about it again
If you get it right and ask the same question again he gives you a new song and you must find the new right answer
I suggest you learn a couple of the songs that are easier to pick out and stick with one question block until he whistles a song you have learned and are sure you can identify
Then having gotten it right don't go back to that question again
You only need to get each topic correct once So when you get the three right answers the birdman flies
down and talks to you
Be sure to exhaust the whole conversation even after he gives you a divining rod to help locate the underground spring
Take some time to enjoy the ambience
You can follow the raven as it flies from tree to tree and if you poke around the shoreline there are green frogs hopping here and there
Go to the center of the island to find the hotspot and use the stick there
The well appears and you can go down
Head right on down
The electric creature is scary
He can't really hurt you but he can prevent you from reaching the crystal at the bottom
Aha
it's the Glass Tower which contains Nuada's silver hand
Exit the well once you have looked at the quot glass tower quot The frogs and raven seem to be gone now that you've altered the landscape
Talk to the birdman about the well and the electric eel
Before you leave the island let's drag out thatcrystaland see if we canmatch the patternon it with something nearby
Try going back to the well and step once toward thebig tree
If you cannot find the right place Click Here to see it Hold the crystal up against it and see how thelines turn red
Click and go for an unexpected ride
You will need to do the same thing at each of the three worlds and finally back at the ship
Come back to earth go to your trusty steed and return to Chapel Island
Clippity Clop Splish Splash and all that
Go to your work table and use the brush on Nuada on the right side of the manuscript painting his sword
Use the brush again in the center area to enter the painting and converse with Nuada Take his sword
For a little fun attack Bres with the sword
You quot die quot but come right back to life
You could have done this earlier when you were at the book the first time it doesn't matter
Talk to Dian about Fintan and his daughter until he understands why she is a statue
Exit the book and go talk with Ailill
Ask him about the birdman poet and about Airmid
Now you need to find a way to revive Aine
Maybe it's time for Brother Liam the Abbot to help again
Ask him about the sun and he gives youBrigid's Cross but he doesn't know what it's for
Ask him about the cross and it reminds him of the sun spinning across the sky
Put it on thetapestry Aine will appear and you can talk to her
If you start at the top you find out she's just a little cranky after being dead years
Post Mummified Syndrome maybe It would seem appropriate to visit Airmid again since Aine promised we'd get our wish
Go to the manuscript and enter to talk with Airmid
After the opening automatic conversation ask her about everything
When you speak of the snake and she wants the salmon exit the book
Turn back towards the book and paint on Airmid on the left side
The salmon appears
Re enter speak with her about the snake and she gives you the Salmon Amulet which will protect you underwater
Go to Birdman Island down the well and use the Amulet at the bottom
When the electric snake tries to attack his efforts are reflected discouraging him
You can pick up the Glass Tower and return to the book
Go to Dian and speak with him
Give him the Glass Tower and he places a Gaelic curse
blessing
on it to make it more fragile
Then you can break it with Nuada's sword
Take the silver hand
Give the hand to Nuada works like the salmon reflecting his powers
Bres is gone and you are finished with this quest
Exit the book
When you go out of the chapel an automatic scene unfolds
Take careful notice when the Abbot finds the fallen waistcoat of Bres and hands you a triangular stone
Away we go then take care not to catch your cassock in the campfire and kick up your heels a bit
It's the last chance you have to relax for quite a while
You will return to the Atlant
There is nothing new to be learned from the guru so place the triangular stone with the pointy markings not the new one in the Planetarium just to the left of the Ireland stone
You will be transported to the Mayan lands after changing to disk two
Look around if you like take in the landscape and notice that the supernova is also present here as it was in Ireland
Then facing the way you started go forward twice turn left and climb the pyramid two flights all the way to the top
Looking left is a sacrificial altar
Look closely at thestar patterninscribed on it for a clue to a later puzzle
In the other direction is a carved obelisk
Go to it and take theObsidian Footfrom the base
Don't click on the fire pot to the right unless you want to return to the Atlant for some reason
Enjoy the condor flying around
Climb down the opening to enter the interior of the pyramid
At the foot of the stairs you are facing an unlighted wall but you can look either way into the tunnels
This is a square tunnel and you can go all the way around to return to this point
Go right toward the lamp then left to the next corner and look right
You can see carvings on the wall
It's a lesson in counting
If you've been to RAMA or played TimeLapse you've done this before you know what to do
Figure out what the lines and dots mean
Studying the marks it appears that the dots are units and the lines are fives
The figures below the columns confirm this
You can see how to write the numbers from one to five
Turn around and go down the next branch of the tunnel
Halfway you can see a staircase and a Mayan man standing on your right
Clicking on him yields a clue quot The Jaguar's number is the Bat's multiplied by itself quot Not much help yet since we need to learn the Bat's number
For now continue going around the tunnel
Turn the next corner go to the end of that arm and look right
Now you are facing the carvings you could first see by looking left after coming down the stairs
We learn more about counting
The first picture represents
Three 's and units
The next column teaches that the next tier up is
The third column shows
One and one unit
Now we know how to count and revalue the tiers
Hang a right and go forward twice to the next carvings
Here is a puzzle but we haven't been given the problem yet
The bat number is what we need and it's not in here
Exit the pyramid and go to the other pyramid and climb up the side facing the same way we climbed this one
Go in there and talk with the high priest and the king's brother
Then turn around and go into the next door and speak with the priestess
She gives you some cleanbandagesto take to the king
Talk to the king his daughter and the Wise One about everything
Exit to the princess
The king gives you back the bandages
She tries the sacrifice to make Quetzalcoatl appear but only Tezcatlipoca puts in a brief appearance
Talk to the princess about everything starting with the final subjects and working your way toward the jaguar topic
When she offers to send you to Xibalba say yes
Disc is called for
Unfortunately you must be disc jockey for this chapter
Keep disc handy you'll need it back in just a minute
During the initial conversation with the bat you can observe thebat's number the dots on his left wing
You can proceed with most of the other duties and puzzles in Xibalba at this time but you will need both Obsidian Feet in order to finish and the other one is back in the first pyramid
Let's go there now by clicking on the bat'spedestal
Disc
The bat came with us and hangs near the priestess
Go to the other pyramid
Down the stairs to the puzzle we found before
You saw the bat's number three
This is thejaguar puzzle so the number is the bat's number multiplied by itself
x
To make nine put a five bar on the bottom and four unit balls on the next row
When you have solved this puzzle the guard at the stairs will let you descend
This level is a little more maze like there is one dead end and one L shaped crossover but you can't really get lost
Much
You descended into a central chamber with two exits
Go either way until you come to the next guard around the far side of the square
Look slightly left and right at each node or you might not see him
He tells you theSnakes number is the Jaguar's number multiplied by itself
Therefore x
Four twenties and one unit should do it
Let's go find that puzzle
Facing the guard turn completely around and enter the passage
At the corner look left for another counting lesson and
To go directly to the puzzle from facing the guard turn right F L to the corner
Solve theSnake puzzlethus four balls in the second tableau x and one unit ball in the bottom
The guard lets you descend to the lowest level
Walk forward and push the switch on the left hand wall
Enter the Crocodile's chamber
He won't hurt you he's made of stone
Find the puzzle at the base of the croc's stand
Nobody gave us a clue for his number but since the others were allsquares of the previous number let's try x
Wow
how to make such a big number
We'll have to go a tableau higher
Let's see what the units and bars are worth
The bottom tableau still represents ones and fives and four fives make a twenty that's where the second level unit value comes from
The balls are twenty and the bars are five times that
So if five twenty units make a hundred bar then the value of one ball for the third plateau is and x for the value of the third level bars
To get put three bars in the third level along with one ball
That leaves us with to go
Second level a bar and twenties
One unit ball in the bottom should finish things off
You can take theObsidian Footfrom the crocodile's open mouth and use it in the depression in the wall along with the other Obsidian Foot you picked up on the roof
The passage opens Take both Obsidian Feet with youbefore you leave
Go back to the other pyramid and click on theBatto return to the jungle To solve the puzzle the object is to get the little man standing in C to complete a route back to his starting point building a bridge as he goes
Each time he passes one of the color blotches it forms part of the bridge
The color sequence is familiar more or less
The traditional spectrum is six colors red orange yellow green blue violet indigo
We will build it inreverse C is in the right place already don't move that one
If you just can't figure it out do this First the swaps A B A C B A A A B C
Then do the rotations by right clicking
One click A and B
Two clicks B and C
Three clicks A and C
Then click on the little man and away he goes
If you goof up and don't get it solved the first time press esc
The puzzle will be reset to its original state when you enter
Now you are across the river and able to use the dugout canoe
Don't go anywhere in the boat just yet
Turn towards the shore and step out
We will be looking for seven stars Here's a wonderfulmapof the jungle by Nebula
Thank you so much Nebula
Use your browser's back button not the quot Back quot hyperlink to return to this walkthrough
After completing the bridge you land on the far shore at the purple spot on the map
Use the map to help find the seven stars and go to the X spot to use them
The stars are all on the ground
Look straight down
Some are in shadows and hard to see
Start by going to the right
Work your way around counter clockwise to the dead end at the top of the map then through the middle getting to the dead end at the bottom last
Go the X spot on the map
Solve theStar PuzzleThus When you solve the constellation puzzle a statue rises up from the jungle floor
Try talking to it
You get an echo
Place an Obsidian Foot in the niche at the bottom
The statue speaks but it is garbled
Place the other Obsidian Foot in the small obelisk on the opposite side of the clearing
The Jaguar god Tezcatlipoca awakens
Isn't he gorgeous
Talk to him about everything and he allows you to consult Quetzalcoatl the feathered serpent
Quetz need two skulls to produce chulel and he gives you a feather for protection
Oh oh


protection from what
Yikes
Now we need protection Find the great big warty mushroom and go past it to the two large brown trees
Turn right to get see the view shown here
Step into the boat and go left around the island six nodes
Exit to the right on the mainland
Enter the jungle and you come to a spider web the size of a trampoline
Eeek
Go around the large tree to the right and climb into the web
You need to start at the edge of the web with the broken spot just on your right
Take one step forward toward the spider to get its attention and turn around returning to the edge
The spider follows you but she is not very fast
It's a good thing because this web is sticky
Turn left one node along the edge then left toward the center
Go to the caterpillar and pick it up and keep going straight across the web to the other side and jump off Now go up the right hand tree again and start at the same spot as before with the broken section on your right
Do the same thing step toward the spider and return to the edge once left counterclockwise then once toward the center
Now the difference turn right and go all the way around the web counterclockwise on the second row in from the edge until you get to the broken section again
Back to the edge and forward three times
Now both spiders are on the perimeter and you can get to the center pick up the butterfly turn around and go back to the same side and once more counterclockwise to exit
This is the hardest part of the whole game
If you made it through the two spiders you are truly a game master
To see a map of the correct path through the two spider webClick Here Sunshine gets credit for this beautiful graphic
Thank you for the map Sunshine Go back to the boat and enter the river
Turn right again keeping the island on your left
Forward three times and exit right to the mainland
Go in and feed your two prizes to the Toad
He gives you two clues quot The Jaguar answers the call of the stars quot And quot Does Smoking Mirror and His Mirror have their feet quot In case we didn't know to bring the Obsidian Feet with us we would have to return to the first pyramid to get them
Go back to the boat enter the river and go left three nodes to return to the spider web
Apparently the designers wanted us to discover the hungry toad first of all then outsmart the spiders to get the insect prizes then re visit the Toad in order to find out what to do with the stars and obsidian pieces
I have opted to rearrange the sequences
Saves about an hour of traveling
Last spider This time you must go around and up theleft hand treeto place yourself just left of the broken section
Look right and place thefeatheron the far side of the broken section
It turns into an orange dot
Some kind of spider munchie I guess
Go stand on it and watch Big Mama Spider until she starts to come up that side of the broken section
Then step back to where you started on the other side of the gap and head for the center of the web
picking up the sword
When you see the sword in your possession just turn around and let her approach and whack the spider with the sword stunning her long enough for you to get to the center and pick up the skulls that Quetzalcoatl wants
Exit the web on the far side as before Be sure to walk towards the edge node that isn't blocked by support threads or you can't jump off in time Go to the boat step into the river and lookleft
Proceed clockwise around the island
Remember you were on the mainland which surrounds the island
and return to the jungle island
Be careful after five nodes forward as you are adjacent to the Bat landing there arethree hotspots left takes you to the bat center takes you downstream right takes you to the island landing Give the skulls to Quetzalcoatl and he gives you his chulel
Don't be squeamish Go to the bat
Talk to him if you like and return to the land of the living to give your king his chulel
If you didn't take time to explore all around the first time you were here do so
It's well worth the look
Go down the steps behind where you arrive and see the sights
There's nothing to actually do here but there are some people and things to see including another pyramid
The creators of this world took a lot of time doing it and the least we can do is appreciate their efforts Before you climb upthe King's pyramid steps turn around andface the green tree
Hold yourcrystalto match the etching on it to the pattern of the tree so the lines turn red Click here to see what you are looking for
Fly me to the Moon again
Return to earth and now go see the king
You have saved the world again
Time to return to the Atlant and use the third triangular stone to visit China
You see yourself entering the body of Wei Yulan a visiting researcher
Do not ring the gongunless you want to return to the Atlant for some reason
If you try to exit the main gate your way is blocked by the shadow of a large warrior
Talk to Wu Tao Shih the old master
Turn around and go back up the steps take one step toward the entrance and turn right then left around the corner
Forward once after turning the corner and look behind you
Speak with Sung Tao Shih
Then enter the building and go into the first room on the left
Talk to the Abbot until you have the whole story and he suggests you talk to Master Wu
You must have attempted to exit via the gate to trigger this conversation
Wu tells you to meet him in the room of the turtle which is inside the closed door on the right
Go in and talk with him
He gives you a medallion and a turtle
Ask him about both objects
He tells you that the turtle walks toward the mountain with the plain at his back the pagoda on his right and the river on his left
The red symbol is the mountain
Rotate the ring click once on the left rim until the mountain is on the far side and place the turtle in the water
Then go to the place you must be standing to begin
You must start in the corner diagonally oppositewhere Wu is standing
Tell Wu you are ready and he guides you giving directions vis vis the turtle and its symbolic directions Take one step in the appropriate direction each time he tells you until you have reached the house of the Tiger
Then two steps toward the red wall and it opens
Love that unfolding effect
Go inside
Open the chest within chest until you find themagic wand Go to the other end of the magic pool and light the fourincense burnersstarting with red and going clockwise
You will breathe the incense and shrink making it possible to enter the magic world
Go in as far as you can toward the bridge and pick upfive statues and a money bag Return to the real world and step off the ivory platform to become large again
You need to place the five statues in their proper work environments
The Woodsman goes in the forest the Water carrier in the river the Blacksmith in the volcano the Shepherdess in the field and the Cook in the kitchen
The money bag goes in the center
Then walk toward the magic bridge to shrink
Talk to each person
They are of one mind they will give you something if you pay them
Fair is fair
Give them each a coin in exchange for a medallion
The medallions representstone metal water wood and fire
In the process they give you clues to the riddle so you can figure out the sequence to put the discs
Go the lift bridge control where you found the statues and place the medallions on the pegs in the above mentioned order
The bridge lowers halfway
Then according to the riddles quot later quot clues place them in this new order water fire metal wood stone
Cross the bridge and go to the golden doors
This is the place to activate your crystal To see the correct view click here If you want to wait until you are leaving or until the end of the game it's okay
Important click on the hunter so the arrow points at him not at the fox
Go through the golden doors andenter the dragon
No not the movie with Bruce Lee To get the dragon going you need to find the key which is amagic pearl
Look at the dragon cloud device on the wall
To start click on the dragon then to raise all the small clouds click on the large clouds in this sequence left right right left right
Take the pearl and go into the cockpit
and place the pearl in the spot next to the door
Enjoy the marvelous sequence as the team fires up the dragon
I sure hope the guy up front knows how to drive
You arrive at Master Tan's house
Go the front door and enter
Ooops
Guess it's not that easy
After all a guy who has not had a visitor in years is bound to have a state of the art security system
How to get in
Go around to the right to see if he has another door
No such luck
Try the front door again
Keep doing that until Tan Yun appears
He is fairly cordial but he invites you to go to hell anyway
Talk to him about everything
The side door is there now and you can go in
Talk to the fellow just inside the door
I'm sure he used to work for the Motor Vehicle Department
Probably still does in fact
Take the blank form and go looking for the Department of Pre Approvals
Whoops sorry that's another game
If you want you can go back outside and talk with Tan
It's optional but you will learn what the characters inside are all about
We need to find the Chinese girl
She won't be there if you left the arrow pointing at the fox she was a fox in real life and she and her cubs didn't survive
If this is the case you will have to back track to the golden doors and turn the arrow toward the hunter sparing her life
She is grateful andgives you a fan
The fan showsthree emblems which are randomized from game to game
I needed to find a blue horse an orange dragon looks like a cooked turkey and an orange tiger yet another time a blue dragon a blue leopard and the same blue dragon again
Another walkthrough reports needing the blue horse a blue dragon and the orange dragon yet another reports needing still a different combination so it could be any three out of a possible six
There's no map of this maze it's not really a difficult maze just apain in the buttmaze
Oh well this is Hell after all
It's not supposed to be pleasant
Three of the form stampers are upside down standing on the ceiling
you need to find the steps that allow you to turn over and walk on the ceiling
I do believe the same characters always use the same stamps so here's a description Blue dragon Boss Hogg in a yellow slicker Blue entire horse upside down rabbit in red silk Blue head of leopard upside down horse right next to stairs
Orange horse head only purple rat OrangeDragon dog in blue amp red Orange entire tiger upside down old goat in purple
Get the mushroom from the grumpy guy at the door
Glad to be done with those Spirits whizzing around
Go to Master Tan and give him the mushroom
You get the magic lantern in return
Ride the dragon back and exit this area through theGolden Doors Just after stepping through the doors look right and use yourcrystalto match its pattern so thelines turn redas before To see the correct view click here That is if you didn't do it on the way in
You get to see still more of the journey
Retrace your steps back to the turtle room and exit
Use the Serpent Lantern on the Shadow
Enjoy the destruction of the shadow demon
Master Wu gives you your third stone and you return to the Atlant
Now the crystal that you activated at the three worlds has the original pattern on it
Go up on deck and look toward the bow of the flyer to match that pattern
End up at the moon again but this time we have options other than just returning
Turn around and look toward the sun and there is a new direction to go
Do it
Then look a little to the right and go again
Don't turn around and go backwards always take the easiest route forward
You pass through the solar atmosphere put on your hot suit will you
and whiz past Jupiter and Saturn
They apparently haven't heard about the cost of fuel out here
Go through the Asteroid Belt
Then the nebula to the planet obscured by asteroids the sun from a distance and finally back to earth Go to the Planetarium and place your three remaining triangular stones in the appropriate spots
They should be ordered from left to right in your inventory as you received them so start at the o'clock position and put in the ornate Irish stone followed by the ornate pointy Mayan stone and finally the Chinese dragon one
Now use your completed crystal in the center
You will drop down into Lotus Land where you are confined by six curtains
The object here is to click on all six curtains in the same order you placed the stones
The simple quot ones first Ireland Maya China followed by the quot ornate quot versions
Be careful the curtains are not in sequence
You have to look for each one After selecting the six curtains you are transported up to Shambhala
Have a look around
No supernova here
Step off your floating island to the pond
Huh
Talk about fish out of water
Oh well I'm sure there's an explanation
Go left toward the apple tree and keep going that way until you meet Rhea the Earth Goddess Click Here to read a transcript of Rhea's Dialogue Talk with Rhea about Shambhala then yourself then everything else
Go back around the pond the way you came at the apple tree there are two paths
Go right
You will enter the quot circular path quot Visiting familiar sites you will pick up objects and learn some very enigmatic clues from seven characters
You may enter the cycle at any point and after visits will return to where you were
Since each site has two exits you may travel in either direction
If you use an exit and it takes you back to where you just were go back and use the other way out
Here are the places and the objects they contain
The puzzle pyramid pitcher Hell sword Chinese Abbot's room hand in the book grasshopper Bat's landing salmon Tan Yun's yard star altar in chapel pearl jungle frog mushroom dragon cockpit chulel Ailill's grave fan jungle monuments stone medallion ivory shrink plate stick sitting at manuscript feather note three exits here king's pyramid brush birdman island lantern
The second exit at Ailill's grave can be hard to find look just above his head
Talk to each character you encounter and you will hear the following clues The object wasn't paid for
There's nothing for sale in the place you seek
No green circles are seen there
It wasn't made to strike with
There are no stairs nearby
This is pretty obscure stuff the idea is to eliminate objects or locations from your consideration
quot It's not a creature quot for example helps you cross off the turtle salmon and grasshopper
quot No birds fall to the ground there quot eliminates the lantern because it's at the birdman's island
And so on
There is only one object that does not get crossed off your list either directly by a clue or by its location the star You arrive on the bottom of the ocean near Atlantis
Go forward until you find the entrance to Atlantis
Upon entering turn right and F to find a crystal
Pick it up and take it with you
Go left pass the dark pillar and toward the wall with circular paintings
Look right to see the octopus The octopus pushes you back with one tentacle at a time
If you place the crystal at the base of the active tentacle it lights up and you can sever the active tentacle
It takes some fairly aggressive clicking because the time is short and the hotspot is small
I recommend saving right after cutting off each tentacle so you don't lose your progress
Do the biggest tentacles first
After cutting off enough tentacles a short cutscene shows you absorbing the octopus's energy swallowing its ink
Blecch
Absorbing the Dark actually and traveling back to the Atlant
Guru san gives you a final crystal
It takes you to space again
As before from the Earth Moon node go toward the sun
Right close to the sun and past Jupiter Saturn and others to the asteroids
Choose the brighter of the two exits
Next choice bright blue star with rays
Then the bright hole in the red field
Get it
always the brightest since we are the bearer of light
Wind up in Eden for the closing movie
It's a little Adam and Eve ish but does make an effective closing to this segment of the story leaving the idea of a sequel three quel
intact
Be sure to sit through ALL the credits for another short movie at the very end
You get to see Tezcatlipoca

She's a strong fighter witha strong will and kind heart Jade attacks with her Dai Jo staff which can charge up to do a powerfulattack hurting anything in range of her
It can also be upgraded to fireenergy as she performs the energy charge attack Her main tool is her camera
She can use it to make money and completeobjectives

'Uncle' Pey'j is a close friend of Jade's
A portly pig man he's wonderfulat fixing things and more of a mechanic than a fighter
When things gettough he can attack by propelling himself at the enemy with his trusty JetBoots an invention he made himself
Pey'j always looks out for Jade sticking by her side and helping her through sticky situations as best hecan Pey'j can use his Jet Boots to fly up into the air then slam down into theground
This can knock enemies on the ground into the air and can flattenthose he lands on
Soon after acquiring the boots Pey'j will pick up hisCutter Hammer allowing him to cut through bolts and bash enemies over thehead Double H Weapon Power HammerTools Power Hammer Hillyan Army ArmorDouble H is a member of Iris the 'terrorist' network which opposes the AlphaSections
A very dedicated soldier who takes everything seriously and worksas hard as he can to oppose the Alpha Sections and expose the truth behindthe DomZ attacks
As a member of the Hillyan Army he is protected by sturdyarmor and can walk through laser beams which Jade cannot
He's always quotingdoctrines from Carlson Peeters Manual which Jade seems to know as well When attacking Double H has the same energy shield that the Alpha Sectionsoldiers do and uses a power hammer much like theirs
His super abilitystrikes the hammer against the ground much like Pey'j's Jet boots attackcan
As a special ability he dons his army helmet and charges head firstinto a barred or mesh grating
He can also charge into Alpha Sections frombehind to damage their air tanks Secundo A heavily accented holocron part of Jade's computer
Secundo digitizes itemsfor Jade makes wisecracks and helps her find work
He's also a master atcomputers like himself and can help Jade and company whenever they need helprunning or repairing a computer they come across IRIS Crew Hahn Nino and Mei
These three are the primary driving force behind allIRIS actions in Hillys
Hahn is the leader of the group but not the chief ofall IRIS activities in Hillys The chief relays instructions from afar
Ninois the editor and spokesperson behind the IRIS network the one who producesall the issues of their Newsletter
Mei is your main contact in IRIS a cutefeline girl
She's the one you speak with most of the time via E mail andthe one you're sending your photos to Alpha Sections These shady soldiers are said to be the main fighting force against the DomZattacks but why is it they always arrive late
And the kidnappings by theDomZ seem to be getting worse even with their protection their leader isa sinister looking General who leads a propoganda campaign

Pearl Game Reward for finding all pearls Section III Walkthrough Lighthouse After the intro finishes start attacking the Domz as they come near you This is an easy fight just keep combo'ing each one in turn
There are twodifferent combos you can do First tap the mouse button times in a row and you'll hit twice followed by a powerful third blow
Second if you tapthe mouse button twice then pause then start tapping some more you'llstart a spinning attack dealing MUCH more damage
Either way you shouldhave no troubles here Once you've defeated the Domz Jade is taken belowground to confront a verylarge dangerous Domz
Pey'j runs in to rescue her
As this battle starts charge up your Dai'jo staff Hold down Attack to break out of the spikesthat hold you
Run up to the boss and attack his Eye
After a few hits spikes rise up and the boss's eye will rise out of range
When this happens charge up the staff and hit him with a charge attack to knock him down
Hithim a few more times until he rises up then charge attack him again
Repeatthis until he dies Grab the pearl and an Alpha Section soldier will come down to let you up and to tell you that it's save above
Float up out of the cavern After the cutscene grab your Camera
Your camera is used as one of yourprimary moneymakers
You need units to charge up the shield and thereare plenty of things to photograph inside the lighthouse
Start by taking aphoto of the child with glasses and the insect and units respectively
This will be enough to get the power back on and the shieldturned on Turn around go into the kitchen
There's a Starkos on the counter
This willrefill one heart
Take it then take the in the fridge
Go to the stove kick it open and take one more
Turn around and run up the ramp to thesecond level Up here take a photo of the goatlike child with horns There are foranother units then take a photo of the large dog for more
To theright of the dog is Jade's room
Enter there and run up the ramp to getanother starkos
Head out then make an immediate left
Push the button onthe wall to enter the bathroom and get an Active Principle which increasesyour health meter by heart
Run out hit the other button on the wall andrun outside to the shield
It's easy to take a photo of a Seagull out herefor units
There's a two legged otter above the shield but I wasn't ableto take a photo of it
You need the zoom feature which we can't get yet Head back down to the dog Woof
Try to take the item from his mouth andhe'll run outside chase him out there
Run up to him and hit Mouse to diveat him
When you grab him he'll stop and you can take the Box of K Bups which restores ALL your health Take a photo of the field armadillo for unts and if it's nighttime youcan go move down by the tree to get a photo of Fireflies worth units Ifit's not Night just wait it will be eventually If you use your cameraand look for Solaris you can watch the sun set

Head back up run intothe door that Pey'j went into the one by the spinning floating beacon Follow it into the hangar then into Pey'j's Workshop
Take a photo of Pey'j This will give you a full roll of film which rewards you with the DigitalZoom
Run over and grab the Mdisk then play it at the MDisk player thatPey'j was working on
Run outside Run back up the lighthouse to snap a picture of the otter
It's worth a cool credits
Back in the Hangar grab the two Boost units and two POD repairunits from the workbench then start pushing the motor
Pey'j will help you and you'll power up the Hovercraft
Before you leave make sure to snap aphoto of the fish down in the water of the Hangar Hillys Jump in the Hovercraft then head out to the open waters
Look for a buildingwith smoke pouring out easy to spot
That's the garage
You won't be ableto make it there the hovercraft will break down but you'll get towed in
Inthe garage are three rhino people
Take a photo of any of them it's worth units Run in and buy the Speedcraft Motor for pearl the only thing you canafford for now
It's automatically installed on your Hovercraft
Turnaround to the K bups dispenser
There you can buy a Meca Impulser whichincreases your Hovercraft's health gauge by wrench
It costs
Ifyou've taken every photo so far you have units so buy it
Don't buyanything else though
Run to the back of the store to the space engine
Thedispenser there has another Meca Impulser for
Head back out and intoyour hovercraft Now another powerful Domz will attack
It's a FAST moving wormlike doms thathovers over the water
Try to take a photo if you can for a good units then fight him off
He's fairly easy
If you stay in one spot or move slowly he'll rush you giving you ample opportunity to shoot his head
If youaccelerate behind him just stay behind him and fire like mad he goes downfast
Successfully defeating him nets you a nd pearl After defeating him snap a photo of the school of fish
An Alpha Sectionflying machine will stop you if you go to the right so go left into the MainCanal
Here travel straight until you come to a way intersection thenmake a right to the pedestrian district In the Pedestrian District head around and up the ramp to the bird man atthe newspaper vendor
Snap a photo of him for units
A walruslike personwanders around here frequently look for him and snap a photo for more Head up the alley across from the newspaper vendor and enter the Akuda Bar In here snap a photo of the bartender Bull like man for units and oneof the Shark people for bringing you up to units and finishing a nd roll of film granting you a pearl The shark person in the booth talking with the woman has a code for Room on the paper in front of him
If you get too close he'll cover it up
Try toget as close as you can without him covering it and jot down the code
Runupstairs to room and use the code
Inside grab boost units then kickopen the locker to take the pearl
Head outside and go into Room to get aticket from the goat man there Upstairs you can play the pearl game for cash or downstairs you can playthe pellets game against the shark
If you wager units against theshark you can win a Pearl
Try it if you want then head back outside
Headright then down the ramp to the Street Vendor
Buy the PA from her and ifyou can afford it the pearl as well PA costs Pearl costs
Youmay want to play the games in the Akuda bar to earn money for these
Youcan't go further because the guards block your way so head back to thehovercraft
From there use your compass to head to the Black Isle Black Isle Talk to the chauffer then save your game
Run up until you see a smallalcove to your right and enter it
Inside is a vent to jump into
There you'll find a group of odd plated animals
Snap a photo for units andgrab the Starkos and the boost unit in this area then head back In the large area with the beetles to your right is an AP you can't reachyet and in front of you is a closed door
Stand on one arrow and tell Pey'jto stand on the other with the Action key to open the door
Run inside tothe Mine
Plenty of things to photograph in here
Start with the fly in thefirst area for units
Run over to the broken ladder and then talk toPey'j when he calls you over to him to view the Jet Boots
Hit E to sendPey'j flying up then falling down
Run over and stand on a button andtell Pey'j to use the super action to launch you up
Run over to the gearbetween two boards and use the action with it to drop the two ramps Snap a photo of the map and Analyze it to get a map of the area
Then snap aphoto of the orange balloon inside of the spiky shell
The latter is worth units
Run up to it then have Pey'j use his Jet Boots attack to pop oneout
You can hit it in any direction but aim it at the crates of explosives One will open an alcove containing a boost and two Starkos
The other leadsyou to a large purple anemone
A photo of it is worth units
Run up andstart smacking it to get Materia crystals from it each crystal is worth units A grate will block your path turn around and enter the alcove to yourright
Here attack the materia crystal on the ground to get a bunch ofcrystals and send two balloons flying Aim one one balloon at theexplosives in the cart and the other balloon at the larger materia crystal Gather the small crystals then run up the ramp you just dropped
Head rightto get in a fight with a flying Crochax
Try to snap a photo for units Kill it and grab the Materia
Past it push the Cart until it's next to thewooden barricade then use the small gear in the corner
Jump up onto theramp you just lowered In this new shaft snap photos of the green jellies for units a photo ofthe waving tentacles on the walls for units and the jellies covered withbrown shells for units
This should finish Roll of Film and grant youanother Pearl Kill all the monsters in this area for money
At the end stand on the two arrows to open the door In this area kick open the lockers for a Boost Unit Box of K Bups andPey'j's cutting hammer weapon and tool
I'd recommend buying all the starkosfrom the vending machine and saving the game
Now Pey'j can open up thegrates with his tool
Run down the path and make a LEFT at the evacuationmap
Photograph the huge creature at the bottom the Spongus one for units then run past and wait for the creature to emerge from its shell andtake a photo of it for more units
Head out of this shaft using thetunnel to the right of the evacuation map Head all the way back out of the Secondary Shaft down the ramps and thistime let's backtrack all the way out to the mine entrance Not a long run really
Remember the vent
We're going in again
This time tell Pey'j touse his action on the grating
Run to the end of the vent and snap a photoof the pinkish slug thing that you see across the yard netting you units
Jump off the vent and you'll land on a ledge with an AP
I'drecommend giving it to Pey'j but that's your choice there
To give it topey'j open your inventory go into the S A C select it then move thecursor to Pey'j and drop it on his picture Head back into the mine down to the grating that barred your path before Open it with Pey'j's cutters then buy everything in the dispenser machine Another PA is here
Head down Jade will hug the wall under the ramp Pey'j will stay behind but he can still do his super action
Use it once tohit the crystal with an orange balloon creature then run up the ramp andpush the cart all the way over
Head back down and hit the cart with anorange balloon guy to knock down the ramp for Pey'j
After fighting off theenemies run back over the ramp to the hole in the wall it was covering
Atthe top take a photo of the amoeba units
Heac back out and usePey'j's jet boots to catapult you up on the switches just like at the mineentrance
Jump into the new room and press the button to open the door
Savethe game on the Mdisk machine
In the corner of the room kick the power boxto turn off the lights
Then grab your camera and look up towards themiddle of the room
There should be a greenish creature circling there
Snapa photo
Open the grate and head out Take a photo of the flying nautilus shells nabbing units then jumpdown
After Jade steps on the eggs take a photo of the creatures you fight units
If you use Pey'j's super action he can knock these into theair just like the orange balloons
Use this ability to hit the large materiacrystals and ramps as you fight
Make SURE you knock down the ramp to gainaccess to a Mdisk player and three crystals you can hit with your staff
Runto the gear and have Jade use it to lower a platform
Buy everything in thedispenser unit again then move on
Make your way past the anemonies untilyou find one that's on the ground instead of a wall
After hitting it untilthe tentacles retract use Pey'j's super ability to smash it flat
Run past and be ready for the boss
To your right is the photo you need to take ofthe two creatures
Wait until they both pop out then snap a photo
The bossAttacks There are holes the boss can pop out of
When it appears take a photo units
then have Pey'j stun it with his super attack
Do a combo then kill the jellies that pop out
Use Pey'j to stun it the next time itpops out combo it then kill the flying creatures
Now the boss will flyover you and attack with a laser
Charge up your staff to hit it when itcomes near you
Once you hit it it drops down again
Repeat this process Combo it then charge attack when it flies over until the boss bites thedust
Another pearl is yours
As is a cool units for a job very welldone Hillys After the cutscene jump into your hovercraft and head back to town to thePedestrian district
At the newsstand you should have more than enoughcredits to subscribe to both newspapers
Do so if you want to
Across fromthe vendor is a door
Head in
You'll be blocked by red beams but you cansnap a photo of a spider there for units
Head out then into the Akudabar
Save your game
I'd recommend doing the pellet game for a pearl youhave plenty of money to spare
If you lose too much cash just load the gameand try again
It's tough but the pearls are very necessary
Be sure topractice in the 'training' mode a couple times before you play for the pearl Head upstairs and talk to Peepers
Give him the password then play his game It's very easy
This gives you a ticket jot down what the code is
Use thecode to enter the Iris base
Once in there watch the cutscene and take aphoto of the cat girl units
This should net you another pearl
Godown watch the cutscene then grab the mdisk and watch it
Save your game then head out
Now that you have a city pass go back to the square where theguards stopped you before
Buy the AP and Pearl from the street vendor ifyou didn't before
At this point doing everything I've told you If youdidn't lose too much money getting the pearl from the pellet game youshould have around units Head back out to the main plaza past the guards and enter the door leadingto 'Transit'
Here kick the materia box for some units push the lockeraside and crawl through the opening
You can crawl under lasers that arehigh and dive Right mouse button over the low lasers
The point of thisarea is to reach the pearl at the top
To do so you'll need to follow theconveyor belts until you reach one that has a small nook to the side whereyou can jump to another
Be sure to dive over the low lasers crawl under thetall ones as you go
The closer to the pearl you get the harder it will be If you get lost in this area stop on a nook take out your camera and planthe route to the pearl
Once you grab the pearl exit the area then enterMing Tsu's shop First talk to the storekeeper and give him the Password
He'll give you twoMDisks Iris newsletter issues and subscribe you to the Iris NewsFLASH thate mails you with the headlines
Second take a photo of the fish in the tanknext to him Buy a pearl detector units animal detector units Pearl units then you have your choice buy a super attack strengthener for units or buy an AP and Meca Impulser for each
I'd suggest the latter as I didn't find the super attack strengthener all that useful
It's up toyou
I'd suggest coming back after you get more cash to get it Head back to the Mammago Garage
You can easily afford the Neutralisingcannon at this point it's only pearls
It's installed automatically andthis IS needed to complete the mission
Once you head out the Domz attackagain
This is a good opportunity to test out the cannon
Only fire it at theships that have GREEN contrails Now you should have pearls if you've followed my directions and doneeverything so far
We can still get more at this point Do the hovercraft races and
Winning nabs you a pearl and credits for each race Straight out from the Mammago Garage is a beach with a cavern leading tothe Looters Cavern
Follow the Looter through this cavern to get a pearl Shoot at boxes along the way to get extra materia crystals for extra money Avoid the red beams they'll damage your Hovercraft
If you don't thinkyou'll make it through a door use a speed boost
At the end shoot him toget money and a crystal Across the bay is a cavern to the Vorax's Lair
Enter this area and snap aphoto of the frogs units then press the button on the cabinet and grabtwo boost's and an AP
I'd suggest giving this to Pey'j so you have life he has
Save and enter the cavern
Use Pey'j's super attack to knock someof the small enemies into the air and knock them into the ramp and materiacrystals around
Run up the ramp and kill the jellies then use the orangeballoons to knock down the ramps and hit the materia
Cross the ramp leadingto the nd balloon to knock down another ramp get more materia etc
Headback then run down the ramp and attack the materia crystal for money
Jumpover and kill all Crochax for a pearl Head out and to the right down the water passage guarded by an AlphaPatrol ship
Since you have the Neutralizer cannon you can destroy it
AFterit's dead shoot the crates in the water for money then enter the LootersCavern
Use the same tactics as the LC to get another Pearl Head down the channel further
Another alpha ship appears and tows you away Shoot it down then enter the cavern near it
In here take a photo of thelittle worms units then kick 'em for a few units
You can't enter thisdoor yeT so head back out to the channel
After getting all five races looters vorax lair pearls head down to the black isle area
You'll see ahuge pipe leading to the Nutripills factory with another Alpha Section shipguarding it
Blow the ship to peices then enter the factory Nutripills Factory At this point You should have PA 's
I would recommend giving one or twoto Pey'j
Otherwise he'll get whiny about it Once you've given some toPey'j jump up a couple steps and turn around
Take a photo of the flying fanged creature the Vorax units
Keep hopping up until you see a barcode in red
This is the serial number you need to send the governer
Justtake a photo get the code enter the door
It's that easy
Now you're insidethe main area of the factory First have Pey'j open the gate and run through
The rats here are easyenemies
Kick 'em for materia units of money or dive on 'em with theright click for materia
Take a photo units then run over to thered lasers
Dive over the first then crouch under the second then dive overthe third and push the button to turn them all off
Next you need to pushthe crate into the groove on the floor then over to block the electricity Save your game now at the Mdisk player
Next to the elevator is a brokenpiston
Pey'j can fix it but it doesn't have any power to move or a fuse That's your next step Turn to the right and enter the Laboratory
The second you open up theelevator you'll be attacked by tons of mechanical spider things
Sincethey're not living don't bother with a picture They're hard as hell tophotgraph too
The ones in red are the ones about to attack wait untilthey get in range then swipe at 'em once
Get on the elevator then ride itup
At the top run towards the electricity
A Security robot shows up
Youcan't kill it with your staff alone but if you combo it the laser will aimupwards so you won't have to worry so much about damage
The goal is to knockit into the electricity which damages the electrical field
Once you doso run through the door
Here you'll find Double H being tortured by theDomZ
Take a photo as evidence then turn around and photograph the serialnumber
Since you got the evidence the governer will send you the code
Useit to get the Gyrodisk Launcher
Turn around and use it on the Domz machineto free Double H and earn a pearl
Walk up to the Grate and have Double Hdo his special action for a way out and a laugh Run around to the otherside and save a boss battle is coming up next Wallhug your way back to the main elevator room and you'll be attacked by ahuge green critter who grabs Pey'j
Take a photo first units
He'lljump up to the side of the room
Zoom in your camera use a Gyrodisk to makehim jump back down
While he's up on the side of the room he'll fire greenshots
Just stand between two of them to avoid getting hit
Be sure not to bearound him when he lands
After he lands fire another gyrodisk to make himcover his eye
Run up and smack him around with your staff
He'll take abeating then jump back up
Repeat this process Hit him with a gyrodiskwhen he's up on the ducting on the wall avoid him when he lands fire a diskto blind him then hit him with your staff
Do it three or four more times and he should let go of Pey'j and die After he dies backtrack across the crate that's blocking the electricity all the way back down to your ship
Once in the ship head through the tunnelin the top of the screen to reach the pearl that the creature drops
Headback up and once you jump back over the crate to the main elevator area make a sharp right to enter the electrical room
Time your run past theelectrical arcs until you reach the room with the fan
This part is easy Hit the fan a couple times with the gyrodisk to make it power up the buttonout of here
Be sure to bnuy the kbups from the vending machine then pushthe button to enter the dynamo area Circle around to the back of the dynamo Generator and grab the keycard
Arobot will attack
You can stun it briefly by having Pey'j use his jet bootsattack with E or whatever you bound it to
If it starts glowing red it'sgoing to roll at you so dodge out of the way
Smack it when it's not red until it dies
It's a bit tricky but you'll get the hang of it
After youkill it grab the keycard and circle back around to the front of the dynamo Five more will attack you What a pain
Be SURE to have Pey'j use his jetboots attack and knock one of them into the electricity
That way you canget another PA
Once they're all dead use the key on the triangular button to turn off the power
Now grab the fuse
When the power comes on turn itoff again then quickly run behind the generator to grab a second fuse
Runback to the elevator Use one of the fuses in the elevator then look up at the cable that's beensevered in two
The support for that cable is damaged
Toss a gyrodisk up atthe damaged support and the cable will drop down gaining power from theelectrical field below
Now you can use the Elevator to head up
I'd advisesaving your game before you head up
Once you're ready go to the top of theelevator to the upper hall
Once you hit the top Pey'j gives you a disk Run up to the double doors and have Pey'j push one button while you pushthe other
THey both have to be hit at once
Once inside the Domz attack Try to take a photo if you can it's worth units
BEFORE YOU CONTINUE
BE ABSOLUTELY SURE TO REMOVE ANY PA 'STHAT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO PEY'J
Once they're dead climb up the machinery and kick open the grate
First walk DO NOT RUN or you may trip an alarm
over the pipe to the middle Turn around and you'll see some crates going through an X Ray machine
Whenthey pass through the machine you'll see a skeleton appear
Photograph thatskeleton for the first report
WALK over to the far side of the pipe andenter that room
There's a grate with a white mouse jump down and walk downthe ramp
At the bottom is a map of the factory
Photgraph it and analyzeit for the map of the area
Then crouch and SNEAK up to the white mouse tograb a photo
Then head back to where Pey'j is Bummer Pey'j is gone now
And WILL be gone for almost the rest of the game You will find ONE PA that Pey'j drops
If you gave him or more PA 's thenyou get ONE back
So you CAN lose PA 's if you're not careful here
Push thecrate underneath the slit in the door
Jump on top then throw a disk throughthe slit and hit the button to open the door
You can't pass the lasers sokick open the grate next to them and crawl through
After a very briefconversation with Double H crawl through past the guards then kick therats as they come out of their holes for a few credits
Be prepared for somestealth maneuvers as now you're up against Alpha Sections who are VERYstrong VERY tough VERY good fighters If you missed the report with the X Rays earlier here is another place toget them
First throw a disk at the air tank on the soldier watching thecrates
The second soldier will be alarmed so stay out of his sight
Whenthe second soldier runs to help the first throw a disk at HIS air tank
Nowthey'll both be helpless
Run up and kick them to kill them
Alternatively sneak slowly past them to avoid detection
If they detect you run back toentrance to the area and jump into the small nook
There you can avoidgetting spotted In the second room do the same Either nail both of the Alpha Sections inthe air tanks with disks or crouch under the small wall wait until thepatrolling guard turns around then run into the next area
In this area there's only patrolling guard but nowhere to crouch
Either sneak behindhim carefully or just toss a disk at his back and kick him to kill him
Irecommend the latter
In the final area Double H needs your help to get pastthe flames
You need to use the Gyrodisks to hit the buttons under theflames at a time starting from the left
Be quick
Once you're past savethe game and have Double H push the button to lower the lasers
You canwatch Pey'j's Message if you want Touching
Also I'd recommend givingDouble H a PA or two
Don't worry he won't vanish like Pey'j did
Run downthe corridor and you'll find an alpha section soldier blocking your path Don't bother trying to fight him jump up on the machinery and run OVER him Then kick him from behind You can sneak away but why not get an extrakill and more units
DIn this next area you have two options
Either sneak past the two guards orKILL 'EM
I definitely suggest the latter as this is a hard part to sneakpast but if you can get past the area they're both at you can open acabinet for another PA a set of PODs Think of it as a box of K Bups forthe hovercraft and a Box of K Bups
Run out and around to the X Rayverification room
Turn off the lasers here and you can return to theentrance where they kidnapped Pey'j
However there's no need to go thereyet except to save if you want
Now see those boxes moving across theyconveyor belt
The object is simple keep a box between you and the AlphaSection guard at all times
Sneak past him by staying behind a box it's thateasy Another alpha section guard will be ahead but don't bother
Youcan't sneak past him and killing him wastes time
To your right is an alcoveof boxes run over there
Don't worry if he sees you it leads to anotherarea he won't follow In the closet kill the rats if you want then run around to the vendingmachine
Buy the K Bups and the starkos if you want
Make sure you have atleast one starkos
Head over to the cabinet in the corner
It's empty
Put aStarkos in then be ready to photograph the little insects that come out another units in your pocket
Head out then climb up the boxes and enterthe Nutripills vat area
Press the button on the pipe next to the rat tomake the guard come investigate
After he checks the pipe sneak past him oruse a disk to disable him as he returns to his post
I always suggest thelatter Run past him
In this area you can hit the spiders with disks forsome money if you want
Push the button next to the conveyor for the MDiskinside and open the cabinet for Pey'j's Jet boots and a starkos
Take aclose look at the bottom of Pey'j's boots
Here are two codes run past and two robots will attack
Combo both of them to make them aim up to avoiddamage then knock each one into an electrical field
In the room with thecabinet the boots were in run through the door to the Computer Room
Openthe cabinet for another MDisk If you haven't watched Pey'j's message by now watch it now
The codes on thebottom of the boots are the codes he mentions
Also watch the surveillancemdisk and if you want the hillyan army databank mdisk
Save the game whileyou're at it
Head out then through to routing
Two routes are currentlyblocked off for you so go though the hall with the blue lasers
Jump duckpast them then push the button to open the door
quickly run up to the redlasers then crawl under and dive under through the door
Time to beSTEALTHY
Crouch under the blue lasers and stay crouched behind the barrieruntil the guard turns away
Then crawl underneath the platform he's on
Headaround to the back and toss a disk at him when he's turned away to killhim
Ride the grav shaft up This part can be tricky
You've got to sneak behind one of the soldiers andavoid the attention of the other
If you're lucky you can toss a disk andthe two soldiers will walk very close to each other making it VERY easy tomove behind them
If you get caught run away to the little niche in thecorner and hide there until they don't notice you anymore
Sometimes they'llcall a probe to scan the area for you if so DO NOT BE CAUGHT IN HIS LASERS You will be instantly killed
Once past these guys you'll find an area whereboxes are being moved from one conveyor to another
What you're SUPPOSED todo is to crawl past the guard by using the box as cover then use the craneto move across the conveyors to the other side
Myself
I killed 'em withdisks but it was a DIFFICULT fight
If you absolutely have to try toremember that the staff's super charge ability is the BEST way to take outthese guys as it often hits their air tanks Once you're on the far conveyor belt head through the door
To get past theelectricity just be sure to duck and once you're past save
Wall hug pastthe window and you'll see your next objective the Alpha Section soldier You've gotta take a picture of him but you can't from where you're at
Atthe far side you can see the button on top but you can't reach it
Hit itwith a disk then get on the platform
Once on the platform hit the buttonwith another disk then QUICKLY duck under the electricity
Crawl through theduct and you'll see a lone alpha section soldier guarding this area
Stay inthe duct however and you'll see an opening to shoot his tank easily oncehe turns away The next area has some blue lasers that slowly move up and down
Just diveover the ones that are down and walk under the ones that are up
Easy
Nowyou can finally take a photo of the Alpha Section to finish your report Move along and you'll find two alpha sections patrolling
Try to nail 'emboth with disks one at a time Moving along you'll find ANOTHER patrollingAlpha Section easy pickings for you and your disk launcher
In thisthird section crawl down to the landing but NOT all the way down the ramp Before you move on make sure that BOTH soldiers are looking away or you mayend up being caught on the ramp
Once they are either sneak past them orjust kill 'em both
Of course
I suggest the latter
In the corner of theroom is a vital keycard inside a cupboard
Grab it turn off the lasers and head on through
Now you will see a door to use your new keycard on
Doso
You'll end up behind the alpha section guarding the door
Since you'rebehind him well you know what to do
After he's been dispatched takea photo of the lock he was guarding and send it to missus mayor for thecode Head through and it's boss time
To kill this boss hit its leg so that itlifts
Double H will come down to help you
Essentially you must tell him toattack with E Or whatever you bound it to and then attack as well
Be sureyou're attacking the leg with the DomZ growth on it and Double H will attackthe other
Once the boss falls over toss a disk in to hurt it
Repeat this afew times to get yet another pearl
Head past the broken electrical barrier and grab another PA
Save your game then head down the elevator
Head downto the bottom of the service elevator area then go into the laboratory
Pushthe containers into the small slots on either side of the electrical barrier to open it up for you
Inside take a photo of the mosquito on top of thecow then take the pearl inside the machine
Time to head all the way out tothe elevator room and save Head out then over the bridge to the barred room
Double H can break throughthe bars openning a path for you
You should have one fuse left put itin now you only have a few minutes to get Double H back to IRIS
Head backto the hovercraft Don't get too far away from Double H
then out of thefactory
In this part use CTRL to zoom past most of the mines
Just dodgethe mines as best you can and rush to the city
Lead Double H through thecity to the Akuda bar then up to the IRIS hideout
After the cutscene grabthe pearls
You'll get pearls for finishing the Nutripills mission Hillys First and foremost save your game
You've just completed your first mission and your next big one is coming up
Head outside
I personally LOVE how thepeople start to back you up after you complete the mission At thispoint you have several keycards and can start reclaiming pearls from theAlpha Sections
Just outside of the Akuda bar is a door with a triangle
Useyour key to enter
Inside kick the materia box for some cash then push theBIG box with Double H's help
Crawl under the beam then get ready for aTOUGH descent
I'll go through it step by step First after crawling under the blue beams drop down and hang on the edgewhere the ladder is
Don't fall until the lasers start to power down Second drop down when the lasers are at the top and left respectively Third wait for the two lasers to pass you then crawl to the next barrier Fourth simply move past when the lasers go down Fifth crawl to the left until blocked by the laser
Don't worry about theone chasing you
Just keep moving left
When the laser blocking your pathpowers down move again
The laser that's chasing you shouldn't get a chanceto touch you Last drop down each area individually
Wait until the laser moves past thenfollow it
THe last laser is FAST you may lose a heart Down in this area is a new problem you'll have to face
See the two floatingturrets
By thsemselves they won't be able to touch you
But when you getcaught by a guard they'll instantly kill you and force you to restart thearea
VERY annoying but nothing you can do about it Move down the shaftwith the blue lasers to enter the area
Your goal is to get up the ladder andinto the vent
I wouldn't recommend even TRYING to kill the alpha sections inthis area you'll end up dead instead
Just follow one of them as they walkthrough the lasers until you reach the vent then jump up
Kick the rats toget past
Move ALL the way down the vent and shoot the button through thebroken glass
Then move back to the opening and shoot the button there
Allthe lasers should be off now
Now you're pearls richer
Move along andkick the materia crate for cash then press the purple button
Time to exit which Unfortunately isn't any easier than entering was This next section only has ONE alpha section patrolling so go ahead and takehim out with disks
Crawl under the lasers to the button then press it toopen the door
Quickly CRAWL over to the door and through it
I had FUN withthis part The elevator goes up
Along the walls you'll see lightedchannels
This means that an alpha section will appear there
Duck behind acrate so that he can't see you
Keep moving behind the crates until thealpha section guard gets on
After he gets on ride to the very top avoidingboth him and the other guards in the niches along the wall
If you get caughteven ONCE the hover turrets will instantly destroy you
So don't
At thetop let him walk away then follow him slowly and at a distance
Once he'sbeyond the barrier and out of sight jump onto the crate then through thevent and out
Grab the two K Bups in the area then push the button to exitthe area Head back to Nouri's shop and buy the latest pearl from her
Behind hershop on the nd level is a door locked with the square key
Head inside Remember the ticket you got in the Akuda bar
That's the code you need to getthis pearl
If you didn't get the photo of the starkos eating bugs you cando that here too
Head out and into Ming Tsu's Shop
The only thing to gethere is another Pearl and If you want give him the passcode to get a copyof the report you just completed
Save and watch the report then head allthe way out
Now look around for the barred door which Double H can knockopen
Enter this area Get in the elevator and have double h push the button
At the bottom keepgoing until you reach a guard
He's alone so don't hesitate to take him outwhen he looks away
You can go through the route he was guarding or you canturn around jump down over the sewage then jump up to reach the room thatwas blocked before
Inside is a materia crate and two Sets of Pods so Iwouldn't pass this up
Once you grab 'em continue past the area previouslyguarded by the alpha section
In the next area once again there is only guard
But this time there are also floating sensors to avoid
Hit him witha disk then walk past the sensors and kick 'im
In the next area kick thecrates then move up to the button on the floor
When you stand on it thedoor opens
RUN until the laser is next to you then crawl under the laser then run to the door
Dive over the lasers and through the door
Whew Tons of Materia boxes in here as well as another Pearl
There's boxes worth units each
Once you've gotten them all time to do ANOTHER laserrun same idea as before
RUN until the laser is close duck under thelaser and run until you hit the door
This time though there's twolasers your reward
Two more pearls
Not bad at all
Head up the elevator but be ready
This is a FUN Chase in my opinion
The second you move pastthe lasers you're chased by an alpha section soldier and a bot
Just run and avoid the sensors along the way
Keep going until you reach acul de sac where you have to turn and run up the screen instead
Follow thepath until you can jump up two crates then head out
Now you're done here let's head back out to the hovercraft Time to head back to Mammago's
This time pick up a Jump kit when you'rethere
Buy repair pods or whatever you want to then head out
Head back intothe main canals and now you can jump the laser barrier on the left and gainanother pearl from the crate
Head back out to the lighthouse area
Beforewe jump the barrier head over to the area where the looter's cavern was Head down this water channel until you find a gate to the left leading tothe Alpha Sections' underground HQ
Save the game Photograph the worm guysif you haven't then head up and through the door
A Crochax has a pearl Head through until you meet the little egg shaped robots again
Double H canpop 'em into the air just like Pey'j could do so to hit the electricalbarriers
Disable BOTH barriers Use the button to get another robot thenhead through to the right of where you entered
You'll find a black securityrobot guarding a cabinet
Knock him into the electricity then open thecabinet
Inside the cabinet a Meca Impulser and two speed boosters Grabthem all
The buttons in the next area summon robots which you'll need toget past all the electrical barriers
Use one then knock the black robotinto the barrier then get two more egg robots to get to the crochax
Twomore will appear fight all for more pearls
Head back out to thehovercraft then out to the canal Head left towards the black isle then behind it
There you should seeMegaptera Purpurea a giant whale
Take a photo when it jumps up
You canalso get Manta Cyanea here the flying Manta Ray
Head back through thechannel to the area outside of Mammago
Use your new jump kit to hop overthe laser to get out to sea
Out there take a photo of the whale you seethere and the red flying manta
Turn left and enter the cave on the smallisland
Welcome to Looter's Caver
Use the same tactics as before to netanother pearl
My advice is to save the speed boosts until you're SURE youwon't be able to make it
There are more than a few places where you'llneed to jump over red beams
Try to avoid them at all costs Back out to see you'll see two destinations
The Hovercraft races on theleft and the Looter's Cavern on the tiny island to the right
Head to theLC next
You'll get a message you're leaving territorial waters you canenter the LC without fear
If you try to leave the area you'll take a bitof damage and turn around In this area it's very easy to hit mines and losetime so BE CAREFUL
This is the hardest yet so don't worry if it takes youa few tries
As a general rule of thumb if it's red avoid it
Once youfinish up here let's head back to the Lighthouse
In the lighthouse openthe two panels One in the hangar one on the nd story where the childrenwere sleeping and enter the two codes from Pey'j's Jet Boots
Once they'reboth entered push the red button on the panel in the Hangar to open up thearea with the Beluga
Grab the MDisk and the first Flight Stabiliser
You'llneed another to get the Beluga up and going but you can't get one yet sohead out Time to enter the Slaughterhouse
To do so you'll need to do theSlaughterhouse races
I recommend doing each one once to get the pearl foreach
If you manage to break a record you will also get extra cash
Onceyou're ready enter the third race
Midway down the track look for some redlaser beams on the LEFT side of the track right after a speed boost panel The object is to jump these with your new jump jets
IT'll take QUITE a fewtries so be glad we got all these repair pods and such
Once you'reinside Slaughterhouse Welcome to your third mission from the IRIS network
This is a TOUGH mission the toughest in my opinion
Doing it isn't so bad reaching it is tostart follow the road
Easy as that
As you go down the large spider robotwill attack
Do your best to avoid it
When you reach the area with thefires try to jump as you go up the ramp to avoid them
If you fall at anytime you'll take damage but get sent back a bit so you can try it again The next area the slaughterhouse quarter is far more annoying
First photograph the worm in the water
Next see the patrolling boat with thelight
What you have to do is get into the light to get the boat to drop atorpedo
Then lure the torpedo through the cave to the mines
The torpedoshould automatically attack the mines clearing the way
Sound easy
Itisn't
Prepare to get hurt a LOT doing this after you're through buy somerepair PODs and the K Bups and save the game
To proceed you and Double Hmust open the gates manually by pushing
Some DomZ attack before you canpush it open but they're easy to kill especially if you can get off a supermove
Once the gate's open get back into the hovercraft and jump up andthrough In this area the first part has you avoiding the red lasers
Blast open thecrates for some speed boosters then try to avoid the lasers and pass
If youget hurt you should have some repair pods now
once past let the fan blowyou through to the main area
Blast the crates for cash and use theNeutraliser Cannon to destroy the mines floating there
Be quick about it they respawn after a few seconds
Clear a path to the ramp then head up
UseCTRL Run to move past the fans quickly and be careful not to fall off
Asyou move past you'll come to a watery area with fans filled with mines You can blast the mines if you want but I found it easier to just dodge themand move on
The goal is to move between the two fans at the end
Oncethrough blast the mines and move into the vents
Here are the BIG mines theones you can't just blast
To get past you'll need to push the steel cratesinto them
One crate is right here in front of you
For the other you'llhave to search
Before searching though look for an entrance to the racesfrom here
This will open up a shortcut between the entrance to the races and this area When you're ready to continue head through either of the two side by sideopenings One is broken
You'll enter an area with passages
Two areblocked so head up the ramp
Here knock down the second crate to get pastthe second mine
Continue down this channel to get to the slaughterhouseentrance
Once here dock and turn left
Crawling on the rubble you shouldsee a Trilobite to photograph
Also photograph the frogs if you haven't doneso outside the vorax lair
Then toss a disk up to the button on the far wallto open the gate
As you go through you're trapped here until you completethe mission
Don't bother to photograph the serial number yet the Mayorwon't help you The next area is the Surveillance room
Head out of the hovercraft then wallhug past the pipe
The best way to kill the flying DomZ robot I have found is to use your super weapon's abilities to toss out little purple shots
Justcharge up after he stops firing then tap the mouse button like mad as youfly up into the air
These have a VERY HIGH chance of hitting one of histanks
Do it a few times and he should go down
Don't bother crossing thelaser field yet
Just run over to the fence and try to hit the button with adisk
Then jump down to the hovercraft and drive to the other side
Dock onthe other side and now Double H can follow you up
Save your game here Now go into the middle laser area
Double H can disable these lasers withhis super action have him do so
Enter the door the flying robot wasguarding to reach the Trolley Area
Here you can gain the map of the area byphotograpping it on the wall
Exit the area
Head over to where the buttonthat lifts up the gate is
To the left climb up all the pipes then onto thegate and have double H push the button to lift you up
Run to the otherside and enter the passage to reach Ventilation
In here kick all the rats Shoot a disk at the button so that you can take a photo of the IgnisIgnifera
Head back out and have Double H push the button to raise the gate Run across while the gate is still up and jump up onto the platform
If thegate lowers before you get there have Double h lift it again
Jump down then into the hole in the wall
Knock the robot into the electricity thenrun past to get a set of Pods and a Meca Impulser
Jump up into the hole inthe wall next to the cabinet and run through to get back to the main areaand grab Double H Push the crate to the hole in the wall and jump up
Head through then tothe area you fought the robot in
Have Double H hit the grate to open it up Inside is an Alpha Section
You'll HAVE to fight him but double h willhelp
My advice is to use a super move and he should fall easily
Now seethe bubbles
You gotta photograph that little thing
But if you pull out thecamera it hides shoot a disk at the rubble
Eventually you'll scare itout and it heads over to the OTHER rubble you have to take a photo whileit scurries
If you miss just toss a disk to scare it again
It's a pain but this is all about getting right
Plus money is money head intothe trolley by pushing the button On the other side buy some K Bups then head into the next area
littlerobots attack and there's barriers
And Double H can knock them into theair with his super action well you can figure out what's next Grabthe keycard from the third robot
Since you already have one give this oneto Double H
If you need more little robots push the switch
Once you openup all barriers run through the open passage to get a pearl and save yourgame
Remember how I told you to give Double H a triangle key
Well now youneed it to open the door he puts his in you put in yours
Do itsimultaneously and the door opens
Run inside and have Double H use his keyto turn off the lasers
DASH through
Then do the same in the next area
Bequick or be dead
Once past all the lasers disable one of the alphasections then kill the other it's easier with Double H's help with asuper move or two
Kick open the crates and lockers for goodies then take aphoto of the area in the middle the one with humans going up the tubes rd of your report is done Head out back to the vending machine
Across from it is a button
Thisbutton pops up an amoeba for you to photograph
Since you can't pull out yourcamera fast enough photo it by hitting the button with a disk
Go backthrough the trolley past the broken electricity through the wall and backto the hovercraft
Whew
Save your game before you get into the hovercraft and then move on
Turn RIGHT to knock down the grille so you can bypass thegate in the future
Then let's head to the Interior Moats Head left and continue until you see a green waterfall
Next to it are somebones Head up there and dock the hovercraft
Move inside
Save your game You can't proceed past the lasers at the bottom so wallhug past the pipe atthe top
You'll come to a room with an alpha section on a platform
Shoot thebutton don't worry about alarming him
He'll get knocked off by theelectricity
When you go across you have to dive and then crouch to getpast the electricity
It's tough but you can do it
In the next area you'llsee a huge amount of fog on the ground and an instakill laser floatingabove
Fun
What you need to do is crawl through the fog
The Alpha Sectionscan't see you in the fog
They'll see you when you go over a bump in the fog so don't go over any inclines unless they're DEFINITELY not looking
Failuremeans death and restarting the area Once past this annoying area comes an easy one
Here you just need to kickthe power box on the left then dash to the fuse and grab it
Just run anddive over the only low lasers it's easy
Put the fuse into the empty boxnext to the elevator to power it up
Head up
Two laser barriers two robots you should be used to this by now
Grab the starkos and the box of K Bups then head over and kick the crate
Opposite of the crate is a doorway There's alpha sections here a whole lot of mines and a floating sensor Toss a disk at one alpha section the other should come running
If you'relucky you can hit them both
If not keep trying until you do
It's SOmuch easier with both of them out of the way
Just run to the opposite sideof the room and avoid the mines
This will net you a PA speed boost andcash
Head out back to the main area Head through the broken electric field and you'll see a pearl protected bylasers
Since you can't go in this way go around
Avoid the mines Duh and you get to a VERY difficult part in my opinion
Here you havefloating death lasers and FOUR alpha sections patrolling
You need to crouchbehind the first crate follow the walking alpha section as he moves away then as you reach the OTHER moving alpha section move behind him to avoiddetection then move BACK to the area the first was patrolling and into thehole he was guarding
It's hard and you'll die a few times but persevere In this area grab the pearl and the Starkos then exit by the lasers Congratulations now you have to do the four guard area again
You might wantto back track and save your game
The You have two doors one protected bylasers one without
Enter the one without and save
Push the box to exposea hole in the wall
Enter the hole then toss some disks at the mines todestroy 'em
Once all the mines are gone return to the other room
Kick thepower box then move through the hole quickly and grab the fuse
It's easiernow that the mines are gone
Return to the other room and save Head out then use the triangle button to turn on the elevator and head down There's an alpha section soldier guarding the door crawl over to the doorand make a CAREFUL shot to his back
Since he's facing to the side it'stough
Once he's disabled hit the mines with disks then run up and kickhim
Enter the room he's guarding for a PA speed boost and some cash
Exitout
Crawl through to the left
This alpha section guard doesn't have an airtank but he patrols right on a moving platform remember the last guardthat was on a moving platform near electricity
Once he's dispatched move on the platform hit the button and crouch to avoid the electricity Moving on is a tough area with Alpha Sections but no instakill laser Still be careful if you choose to fight they fight HARD One past them use a fuse in the box to proceed
Turn off the lasers then save In the next area sneak past the two guards on the left and kick the one onthe far end
Then as Double H keeps the two busy Use a super attack to killthem off Isn't the super attack strengthener great
Those purple orbs arethe BEST way to kill Alpha Sections
Once they're all gone move to thewindow and photograph the humans being unloaded from the shuttle to fill inthe nd part of your report
Only part left the toughest to get to byfar
Head back out past the lasers you took down return to your hovercraft Time to head to the far side of this area
Two BIG mines
Torpedo launchinglights
Remember how we did this before
This time it's trickier the lightsdon't launch the torpedos
Lure a torpedo to the big mines and you're in This section is tough the mines regenerate FAST
You only have a coupleseconds to clear a path
Don't even bother trying to kill them all
just makea path along one side or another until you get there
There's a vendingmachine at this dock with repair pods to repair any damage you got
Headinside to the East Wing Here is one of the hardest parts of the game IMO
First have Double H killthe alpha section by using his super attack twice
The MDisk is blocked byelectricity
Kick the box and run in to save
Then have double H charge itto get back out
All routes are blocked by lasers except one a ladderleading up to a vent
Head in there
As you come to the alpha section guard you find he's alone easy pickings
One disk to the back later push thebutton
Head through the door and move down the corridor
Grab the two speedboosts from the cabinet Move along the area to the end to talk to Double H Now for the hard part Drop down when the guard isn't looking
There's aninstakill laser here so you can't be seen at all Move past the first guard down to the other two
You have to CAREFULLY sneakpast them on the right
Expect to die here often
Once you're behind themachinery on the right wait until the guards aren't looking and sneakpast and pray
a lot
I died here often so don't be worried if you dotoo What's worse is if you accidentally touch the guard as you try tosneak past 'INTRUDER
INTRUDER '
Best of luck One trick you can try is to kill the guard on the far left then avoid thealpha section that comes to check on him
Then you can frequently stand inhis area to lure the patrolling guard with a disk then kill him when hecomes to investigate
When he's dead the third guard will come up one byone they fall
Be careful and take your time in this area Moving on you'll see a wooden box and an elevator
Push the box onto theelevator then take it down
Kick the power box to get the fuse then use thebox to get back up
Use the grav shaft to go to teh second level
There arethree more guards here but no laser so take them out as you see fit Myself I disabled with disks then took on the third with super moves It's up to you how to proceed
Past them you can take a pearl a couplecrates and save the game
Keep moving until you turn off the lasers thenput a fuse in the box
Move under the new opening
In this area jump ontothe right side of a crate in the middle
The arm will pick you up and dropyou on the other side of the lasers
Head under the crate area and you'llfind a cabinet with two speed boosts and another PA
Head back and turn offthe lasers to exit this area
Blue lasers bar the path so exit through thedoor Kick the power box to disable the electricity then jump down and save thegame
The disks can take out the mines and a kick takes out the crates forcash
Move down the hall and prepare to fight a TON of annoyingtroglodites Jump up the pipes and have Double H turn off the electricity In the next area are alpha section guards
No laser this time so don'thesitate to take them out if you have to
Move past them to the central hall Toss a disk at the guard to take him out then move past the lasers to avending machine Only starkos in it
Bah
Beyond is another guard to takeout the same way
Moving past is your last report objective and two guardsto kill
Easy as pie take them out with disks and kicks and then takeyour final photo
Once the last photo has been taken grab the fuse and putit in the box to exit
Now the governer will give you the serial number toleave the area
To exit just power down the lasers and use the button Head back to your hovercraft then all the way out
Take a photo of theserial code once you reach the gate and the governor will send you the code Dock and use the code to leave
Use the shortcut out of the exterior moats to the Races and
And now that's it
You've finished another Report Hillys You SHOULD by this time have enough pearls for that second FlightStabiliser
Head out from the races and another attack finishing withANOTHER worm down and yet another pearl is yours
But Mammago doesn't havethe flight stabiliser in stock so we're not going to be heading there Instead go back to the main canal
Head back to IRIS HQ
Before you go in Ming Tzu's has a new pearl and you can see a copy of the report you justfinished
Outside the bar everyone is supporting you
Most people even seemto know that you're Shauni Inside the Akuda Bar Francis The shark by the pellet game has anotherpearl for you to win if you feel like playing
Why not
A pearl is apearl and you should have more cash than you know what to do with by thistime Inside of the Iris Den you meet the Governor face to face andlearn of the Chief of the IRIS
She'll also give you a star keycard
Afterthe cutscene you get pearls from the population and an e mail from Mammago saying they got the flight stabilizer in
Grab the pearls and head out tothe city square Use your new keycard to enter the Alpha Sections HQ
Once again you're onyour own here And with this many alpha sections you haven't got achance of fighting
Not one
Be stealthy be sneaky your life depends onit
Go slowly and watch the alpha sections as they patrol
There's always ablind spot for you to slip past For those who REALLY need help crawl under the bridge then wall hug pastthe first guard
Jump up to the second story while the patrolling guard ismoving away then wallhug until he comes back
Move slowly behind him untilyou get to the niche
Be VERY CAREFUL HERE
He'll stop for a split second and that is the ONLY time it is safe to wallhug inside the niche
He'll movepast quickly BUT QUIETLY move around the corner
You have ZERO room forerror here
Jump up to the next area
Jump and hang off the edge here
Twoalpha sections patrol here
Move past the first as he moves away then do thesame for the second
Jump up to the top level
Two MORE alpha sections here Jump and hang off the ledge as the first turns away
Stay there watch hismovements
Move past him carefully
Jump onto the dumpster then up to theledge
Move past the window when the Alpha Section isn't looking
Bethankful that you don't have to start ALL THE WAY FROM THE BEGINNING if youget caught
Also be thankful that these guys have ZERO peripheral vision Once you reach the room with the patrolling Alpha Section you can finally FINALLY kill him with a kick
Push the button go in the door
SAVE THE GAME You do NOT want to do all that again do you
Grab the pearls
Your reward for ALL THAT WORK is more pearls
As youexit the BEST CHASE SCENE IN THE ENTIRE GAME ENSUES
The head of the AlphaSections chases you down while you frantically duck and dodge away
Thewhole hassle of doing all the work to get those pearls was totally made upby how awesome that chase scene was well in my opinion D After you'redone oohing and aahing head back to the Hovercraft then to Mammago's
Timeto fix that plane
Buy a Flight Stabiliser for a cheap price of pearls Once you have it time to head to the lighthouse once inside head to thevery top for a sad cutscene After it's done head down
DomZ robots attack
You'll need to use yoursuper attack to take them out any other way is WAY too difficult
Oncethey're all gone Go to the hangar and open the door
Install your new flightstabilizers to get the beluga back in the air
A DomZ attacks but it's nomatch for your aerial neutralizing cannon
Grab the pearl Now let's head up to the top of the Black Isle mines
Once you're over thewater filled crater let go of the hovercraft with a right click
Enter theVolcano's Treasure
Dock and grab a Meca Impulser from the cabinet and somespeed boosters
Take a photo of the jelly like thing on the wall If you'vefollowed all my instructions you'll be just ONE photo away from the finalMdisk from the Science Center
and save the game
Continue in
You should by now be an expert at this wallhug over to the balloon Double H hits theground balloon pops up hit it towards the ramp to continue
Fight a fewcrochax here to get more pearls then another crochax for one morepearl then knock the balloon into the far ramp
Fight a couple moreCrochax for two more pearls then four more for four MORE pearls then across to get the LAST FIVE PEARLS
Also you'll get a MDisk from Mammago'sgarage
This is just a fun little Pearl game you can play Now go back through the world
Photograph any species you've missed Don'tworry if you're missing just one the last one is found in space
Collectany pearls you haven't gotten
Load up on K Bups at Nouri's place I wouldsuggest at LEAST ten of them
The last boss is VERY VERY DIFFICULT
Onceyou're ready buy a space engine and head into outer space Moon Selene First shoot the whale that's flying around tossing ice at you until the iceis COMPLETELY gone
Take a photo
This gets you the final photo and theMdisk from the science center
Then just point to the moon and drivestraight once there aim at the transmitter's bottom area and fly intoit Inside of the transmitter kick open the materia crates and buy EVERYTHINGin the vendor you'll need it all
On the wall by the vending machine is themap to analyze
Save the game
Push the button on the floor to get the crateto come over
Hop up the machinery until you can jump onto the crate thenhave Double H push the button
Jump off when it stops moving and you'll landon top of the Beluga
Jump up and toss a disk to the far button to bring theOTHER crate up then toss ANOTHER disk at it and quickly jump on board You'll end up on the other side
Use the gear in the corner to lower thebridge for Double H
This will serve a purpose later I just like to get itout of the way now You don't have things to hold down the buttons sorun the OTHER way into the elevator shaft
You stand on one button Double Hon the other Welcome to the DomZ base reminds me of Aliens
Run over to the mirrorthat's beaming the light towards the elevator
Next to it is a mirror on apedestal
Grab it
Across from the door is a place to put the mirror insertit
Run over to the mirror that's currently shining the light
Tilt it overto the mirror you just placed
Then tilt the mirror you just placed to theLEFT until you light the crystal over there
This lets you get a secondmirror
After grabbing it head back to the mirror you turned and turn it tothe doors to open the next path
Run through but don't bother with themirrors yet
Keep running to the Cloister where Pey'j is imprisoned
Run tothe door behind him and save
Only Jade can fit through here In this next area to the right are two alpha sections guarding a grav shaftleading down
In the open like this they're a CINCH to kill with the superattack
On the left of where you entered is their ship with some materiacrates if you want them
After you're done collecting whatever crates youwant and killing the two head down the grav shaft
Circle around the GreatCrypt until you find the door then run inside
Hope you don't get vertigo Your objective is to get to the green shaft
Look around you and map outwhere to go
It's not too tough
All paths lead there in the end oncethere take the last photo you need now head all the way back to Pey'j
You want the DARK BLUE shaft to get back up Head back to the beam of light
You need to reflect that all the way toPey'j
Put the mirror you picked up into the pedestal under the beam
Now if you want more money reflect it over to the right to get the materiacrystals
If not reflect it to the left to the mirror in the other room Here you have to reflect the beam from the left mirror to the right mirror to the middle mirror and then across all the crystals
It's done with theDisk launcher now
Shoot two disks at the right side of the left mirror andit should spin and hit the right
Hit THAT one with two disks and it shouldhit the middle
THe middle one only need to be hit with one disk
Run back tothe Cloister
Here turn the mirrors so that all the crystals on the OUTSIDEONLY are lit up
Next turn JUST the mirror that the beam of light is hittingfrom the outside
This should light up all the middle ones without having toturn anything
Lastly tilt the same mirror one more time to light all theinner crystals and expose Pey'j
Double H can break Pey'j free butsadly it's too late For the detail minded shouldn't Pey'j be missing his suit and boots
Yet he has them heh call me anal retentive for noticing the minutia likethat Head out of the Cloister back to the DomZ base
You'll get a message fromMei and look who's back
Head back to the ship now
The area that youopened up before now you can open the door there since you have people Head inside and you're attacked by a turret
To get past you need to duckto the side while it's firing and run when it stops
Once beyond the turret enter the trolley to head to the radio transmitter room
Take a photograph ofthe serial code here then input the code you get and enjoy After the Long cutscene head back to the trolley then to the ship
As youexit the base you're attacked by the Alpha Section General
His ship cantake a huge beating and has several attack modes
Listed are each mode andhow to beat him
You can only use the neutralizer cannong for this but thatjust makes it easier this is FYI my favorite fight First mode no sweat
Just fire at the glowing targets Second mode aVoid the center engine area it fires at you
Between shots fire like mad at it Third Mode Avoid the white streams of energy and fire at the glowingtargets
You don't have to aim STRAIGHT at them Fourth mode Stay away from the center area but watch out for the mines hetosses back at you
Between shots fire at the center Fifth mode Stay towards the edge of the screen and take out the glowingtargets Sixth mode Just like the fourth only this time you don't aim at thecenter you aim at the glowing targets Seventh mode Stay clear of the white lines and the electricity by stayingat the far edge of the screen
Fire at the glowing bits Eighth mode Last mode
Don't worry about taking damage here one shot willkill him
Aim at the center Once he's down blast the two mines in the middle by either using the blackfloating barrels or luring torpedos in
Inside save and move in
AlphaSections will attack but your friends should be able to distract them longenough for you to get off a few super moves to destroy them
Head up the gravshaft to see the last words of the General head back to the hovercraft then to the ship
When you head back to the base you're attacked by a hugeforce
Use the neutralizing cannon to shoot down as many as you can untilreinforcements arrive
The battle looks AWESOME doesn't it
Then headinto the base
BEFORE YOU GO DOWN THE ELEVATOR REMOVE EVERYONE'S PA 'S ANDGIVE THEM TO JADE
Trust me it helps a ton
Once you're ready head into theGreat Crypt
Be sure you have tons of K Bups prepared
This is the hardestfight in the game FINAL BOSS For the first part of the battle just kill the DomZ Sarcophagi that attackyou
Then as the boss moves away from the statue back up and use a couplesuper attacks to hit him with the purple orbs
He should retreat back to thestatue
Now he'll guard himself with huge materia spikes and attack withclones of Pey'J
That bastard
Double H's super attack can pop the pey'jclones into the air so you can knock them into the materia spikes
Get ridof the spikes in the middle then send a pey'j clone flying into his body tohurt him
Beware every time you kill a pey'j clone a Sarcophagi attacks Once you hit the body with a Pey'j clone and kill all the sarcophagi Double H is taken This part is tough but the boss ALWAYS attacks in a set pattern
Each timeyou miss or mess up the pattern he'll hit you and take off whole hearts which is why I said to stock up on the K Bups
If you know the pattern you'll know where he appears
The pattern Relative to your position is Left up right left up right above down right up Above means you have to charge your Dai Jo staff to hit him So if I say left he'll appear to your left and you have to hit him there Once he's been hit several times he'll send in a bunch of clones of Double Hto attack PLUS he shoots green lasers at you and killing a clone releasesa sarcophagi
Kill all the clones Super attacks work best then kill thesarcophagi
Ignore the lasers as best you can Now it gets trickier he reverses your controls
Right is left up isdown but he's almost gone and things slow down giving you more reactiontime
He'll send in a few Sarcophagi get used to the controls now he'llattack again appearing in a different pattern this time
The pattern whichhe appears in is Left right left Right above you right up above you DOWN Remember you controls are reversed so if he appears to the left you haveto press RIGHT to hit him
Once you lay the final blow on him you win thegame

I don't give any reference style information like a list of all treasures or encourage you to do unnecessary things
In true walkthru fashion I just tell you the answers without explaining or rationalizing them
If you want non spoiler ish hints see the Beyond Zork hint file on the Universal Hint System UHS website
VERSION NOTES AND CREDITS For this version I made a few minor additions and corrections and added two websites to the list in the copyright section
VERSION NOTES AND CREDITS This is the original release of this FAQ so I have no special notes or credits to report yet
NOTE This FAQ was written while playing the Beyond Zork version that came with the Lost Treasures of Infocom package that was released in by Activision
As far as I know everything will be the same for other game versions
STEP Get the Eversion and Protection items
When you start a new game choose to create your own character then give him an Endurance of a Strength of and a Dexterity of leaving the other three stats at each
This is because it's important to be able to survive hits by tough monsters right from the beginning
From the starting hilltop area go east twice to the wharf
Wait for some driftwood to appear then take it and wield it
Note that you can refer to it as a club
Go west and south take the rusty lantern then go north northeast and northwest
Get the salt from the brine patch then go northwest again to reach the babbling brook area
Save your game then go west to the forest area
Its seven locations are randomized so use the the game's map to help you see what all exits each location has
Your goal here is to pick up one random scroll like object scroll parchment etc
and one random wand like object wand cane etc
There's a cruel puppet that you'll have to avoid while moving around and looking for the two items
If he manages to kill you before you can leave the forest with both items restore your save and try again
If he injures you you can go to a safe area just outside the forest and wait until your Endurance is fully restored before you go back in
When you leave the forest you'll need to leave it to the south
When you do you'll end up in an outskirts area
If you're forced to leave in another direction save your game then re enter the forest and see if you can make it to the outskirts
Once there go southwest open the door and go west into the quot magick shoppe quot Show your two items to the old woman as in SHOW CANE TO WOMAN to get them both identified
If you didn't get either the Eversion wand or the Protection scroll restore your save from before you entered the forest and try again until you get one of those two items
Go east and south from the shop to reach the south market
When you try to go south from it you'll bump into a hawker
Pick up and eat the fish cake he drops for an Intelligence increase which will kick in after a few moves then go south again
Go southeast and east to reach the bluffs area then put all of your loose inventory items into your pack PUT ALL IN PACK
Save again before going northeast since you'll be entering the moors which is another randomized area
There's another random wand item and another random scroll item in the moors
However you don't need to get both of them now
If you got the Eversion wand item from the forest you only need to get the scroll now
Likewise if you got the Protection scroll from the forest you only need the wand item now
Explore the moors either avoiding the eldritch vapor or defeating it until you find the item you're after
As soon as you do get back to the bluffs area
If the vapor steals your item you'll have to find out where he took it
Once you escape with it return to the magic shop and have the old woman identify it
If it's not what you need restore your save and try again
This can get tedious but it'll pay off soon
STEP Get the jewel of the jungle
From the magic shop go east south twice southeast and west to get to the skyway entrance
Wait until a gondola is boarding then get on BOARD GONDOLA
Wait until the gondola is within a few feet of the first support tower
Jump to the tower then save your game
You're about to enter your third randomized area
Go down from the support tower to enter the jungle then explore around
Your first goal is to visit every one of the jungle's eight areas so you can see exactly where the quicksand and idol areas are
If they're close to each other only one or two moves apart then make your way to a safe area like the base of one of the three support towers or the waterfall
Otherwise restore your save and repeat the exploration phase
Once you've got that done get all of your items out of your pack GET ALL FROM PACK then wait if necessary to get your Endurance back up to full
Save your game then return to the quicksand room
If you're blocked from getting there by the crocodile or bloodworm go back to a safe area and wait a bit before trying again
Attack the baby hungus then go to the idol area and type CLIMB MAW to climb partway up the idol's maw
Wait until the mother hungus clambers up onto the idol's maw then repeat the CLIMB MAW command to climb up to the top
You can now take the jewel though you'll drop it and get trapped inside the idol
Turn the lantern on then squeeze the moss you see
Point the object of Eversion at the idol to get yourself out of it then look at your finger it should be itching at this point for a Dexterity increase
Turn the lantern off and go to the nearest safe area
Wait until your Strength and Endurance are fully restored then save again
Return to the quicksand area and point the object of Eversion at mother hungus
Take the jewel then go to the nearest support tower
Climb it wait for a gondola to come close then jump to the gondola
You're out safe with the jewel
STEP Get into fighting shape
Wait until the gondola returns to the skyway entrance then get off of it EXIT GONDOLA
Go east open the door and go north to enter the quot swank quot boutique
Sell the jungle jewel to the old woman SELL JEWEL to get zorkmids

Buy the plate mail and the cloak BUY PLATE MAIL
BUY CLOAK
Pick up the plate mail and cloak then wear them both using the WEAR command with each one
Read the scroll of Protection to see what its invocation word is then type that word in as a command
That'll get your AC all the way up to
With that huge AC you'll take very little damage per attack from any enemy
NOTE You could also afford to buy the longsword from the weapon shop in Accardi by the Sea but that thing is way bigger and heavier than the dagger you'll be getting soon and isn't that much more useful in combat
This walkthru will assume you stick with the dagger to avoid the inventory management problems that the longsword would cause
STEP Raid the pub's cellar
Go south east and northeast to get back to the moors then move north through them to get back to the pub
Open its door and go west to enter it then try going west again
Take the dagger then go west to reach the kitchen
Open the cellar door and go down twice to enter the wine cellar
Pick up the crinkly scroll read it to find out what its magic word is then type in that word as a command
That'll quot renew quot the rusty old lantern making it last a lot longer
It'll also improve the dagger you just got so wield the dagger
Wait where you are until a rat ant shows up then attack it until you win
Put everything except the lantern into your pack PUT ALL BUT LANTERN IN PACK then turn the lantern on and start exploring the dark parts of the cellar
The other things you need to do in the cellar are defeat the discipline crab and get its tiny crown squeeze the moss then look at your finger when it itches to get a Dexterity increase get the amulet from the skeleton hit the skeleton when it attacks you then get the amulet pick up a random wand item and get a wine bottle go up from the quot bottom of stack quot area to find it
Return to the starting wine cellar area and go up
The cellar door will be closed and locked
Look at the amulet using the wine bottle as a filter LOOK AT AMULET THROUGH WINE BOTTLE to learn the amulet's magic word
Wear the amulet then type in its magic word as a command

STEP Raid the lighthouse
Turn the lantern off then go up to return to the cellar's kitchen
Give the wine bottle to the cook then roll the giant onion east
Put all your loose items in your pack using the usual PUT ALL IN PACK command then pick up the bearskin rug
Roll the onion east then north then northeast to get it and yourself to the ledge near the lighthouse
Type in the word LIGHTNING as a command then roll the giant onion west and up to get it and yourself into the lighthouse's first level area
Explore the first level defeating the giant spider and getting the random wand item when you come across them
Get the salt out of your pack then roll the giant onion up to the second level
Explore the second level defeating the slug by putting the salt on it as soon as it appears and getting the bubble gum card then roll the onion on up to the third level
Look around until you find the dust bunny then drop the rug
Rub your feet on the rug then touch the dust bunny to zap it
Take the ring it leaves behind then continue exploring until you find a random scroll
Roll the onion up to the lamp room then search the debris to find a platinum sextant
Pick it up then put everything into your pack
Try to take the sea chest in order to get the dornbeast to show up then cut the onion with the dagger
Attack the dornbeast three times then cut the onion again
Keep this up until the dornbeast is dead after which you can take the sea chest
STEP Put the sea chest to good use

Get the hurdy gurdy put everything you're carrying into your pack then pick up the sea chest
Go west southwest southeast southwest and then south until you enter the moor area
Make your way quickly through it and to the bluffs then go west northeast and north to reach the unicorn's prison
Kiss the unicorn's horn for luck then put the sea chest into the stall
That will free the unicorn but it won't get you the chest back or the saddle that's inside the stall
Say your amulet's magic word again then hit the stall to break it open
Enter the stall and get the sea chest after closing it then exit the stall and go south southwest and north to the boutique
Sell the sea chest and amulet to the old woman then return to the stall and get the saddle out of it plus the horseshoe that's lying around outside the stall
STEP Finish raiding the forest moors and jungle

From there go north northeast northwest twice and west to the forest
Defeat the cruel puppet and hellhound then find the forest area with the boulder that has an inscription on it
Type in YOUTH like a command and a quot pool of radiance quot will appear nearby
It'll come in handy later
Exit the forest to the south and go to the nearby magic shop
Pull all of your unidentified magic items out of your pack and ask the old woman about them to get them identified
You can then sell her the wands with the properties of Sayonara Annihilation and Anesthesia the scrolls of Fireworks Recall and Mischief and the potions of Death and Forgetfulness whichever of those items you happen to have
Look in her display case and ask her about the three potions in it to see if any of them are the potions of Might Enlightenment or Healing
If so buy them pick them up shake them and then drink them
The same goes for if you found those potions somewhere except you won't have to buy them
If you have the scroll of Honing read it to learn its magic word then type it in to empower your dagger
Go east from the shop then south twice southeast and west to the skyway entrance
Return to the jungle by riding a gondola to a support tower just like you did before
In the jungle kill off the crocodile and bloodworm then look around for the random wand and scroll
Leave the ivory tusk alone for now
Since you have all of the wands now you'll definitely have the Levitation wand
If you don't appear to then it must be the one you picked up here in the jungle
Go to the quicksand area and point the wand of Levitation at the baby hungus to rescue it and get a compassion increase
Then put all your loose items into your pack and go get the ivory tusk

Get the hurdy gurdy out of your pack and go to the area where a scarecrow is presiding over a flourishing patch of corn
Turn the hurdy gurdy's crank to the right TURN CRANK RIGHT then check the area's description to see what color the successful scarecrow's rags are

EXAMPLE TAKE MAUVE KEY if the scarecrow's rags were mauve colored
You'll be returned to the Fields of Frotzen right after you take the key so go to the area with the path blocking corbies then go north
They won't be able to stop you now

Buy and take them both then rub the rabbit's foot for a bit of luck
Go east northeast and north to get to the forest then find the forest area that has an oak tree in it
It's the area called quot Twilight quot Wait there for the minx to dig up another truffle

Wait if necessary for a ghoul to show up then attack it until you defeat it
Pick up the spade it dropped then wait for an undead warrior to appear
When it does throw the vial at it to destroy it
The ruins are safe to explore now so look around until you find a random potion and a plaza area
You can also get more spenseweed from the area with the dry weeds but it's not useful to do so
Go to the plaza and stand under the arch then turn the hourglass to enter a narrow corridor of light
Go south twice to reach the Battleground era then wait until Prince Foo gets beheaded
Get the ever fresh truffle out of your pack and throw it into the trench then turn the hourglass again
Go north four times then turn the hourglass and go north twice more to reach the desolation era
Wait for the minx to dig up the truffle and helmet then get the helmet and wear it to raise your AC and Intelligence
Turn the hourglass and go south four times to return to the plaza area then move out from under the arch
Now you can use the scroll of Gating's magic word to travel to Atrii thereby escaping the ruins
You can pick up the minx first or you can just leave it at the ruins
STEP Enter the ur grue's lair
In Atrii go southwest twice and then south
Enter the curtain to be taken to the magic shop
Show the potion from the ruins to the old woman to get it identified then shake it and drink it if it's the Enlightenment Might or Healing potion and sell it if it isn't
Sell the hourglass spade rose whistle and scroll of Gating to help clear out your inventory then leave the magic shop and go south twice southeast and west to get to the skyway entrance
Ride another gondola into the jungle then head south to get back to Thriff
From the main Thriff area go northwest and west to reach the rock wall area
Get the gray sphere out of your pack then look into it to learn the grue lair password
You'll have to have drunk the Potion of Enlightenment and be wearing the helmet for this to work
Type in the lair password like a command then open the door that appears
Get the four leaf clover and horseshoe out of your pack then go northwest to the first underground area
Wait there until the lucksucker appears in one of its unlucky item forms
Throw the clover at it then wait for it to come back in some other screwy form
Throw the rabbit's foot at it then wait for it to make its third and final appearance
Throw the horseshoe at it to finish it off for good
Move on to the next area which will be totally dark
Wait there until you sense a presence lurking in the darkness
Attack the presence until you defeat it then wait for the next one to appear
Keep this up until all three dark presences grues presumably have been defeated
STEP Defeat the ur grue and finish the game
Return to the first underground room and save your game
Get the crystal jar out of your pack
Open the jar and get the circlet then blow a mirror with it BLOW INTO CIRCLET
Now's when things get really tedious
This is another random area hate that randomness
and you're going to need to set up a chain of mirrors to reflect the light from the first underground room all the way to the ur grue's lair
Since the lucksucker has been dealt with the only danger is taking too long in blowing and adjusting the mirrors since they will eventually wear out and pop
In the first underground room turn the mirror so that it reflects the light down the passage that leads to the first dark area
EXAMPLE If light is coming into a room from the southeast and you need to redirect it to the southwest turn the mirror so that it's facing south TURN MIRROR SOUTH
Go to the room you just tried to redirect light into to make sure it actually is lit
If so then dip the circlet in the jar and blow into the circlet to get another mirror
Adjust it to reflect light down the next dark passage and so on
If you enter a room whose only exit or the exit you choose to take is in line with the light that's shining into the room you can skip putting a mirror into that room
EXAMPLE You go northwest into a new room which has exits to the northeast and northwest
If you want to go northwest you can do so immediately since the light is already shining that way
If you want to go northeast instead you'll first need to blow a mirror and turn it to face east
NOTE Keep an eye out for some moss in one of the rooms that you can squeeze
When your finger itches look at it for one last dexterity increase
Or don't bother since it won't make any difference now
Keep this up until you reach the treasure chamber
If you're too slow and your first mirror pops restore your save and try again
Since you saved after you entered the lair the layout should be the same on your second attempt and you can use that knowledge to more quickly reach the treasure chamber
Once inside the treasure chamber blow another mirror and notice what corner of the room the quot curious shadow quot is in
That's the ur grue and you'll need to turn your mirror to reflect the light straight at him
Think of him as the next passage you need to shine light down and turn your mirror accordingly
Since you've made it this far you should be able to figure it out easily
After the ur grue drains your compassion and gives up search the treasure to find the Coconut of Quendor
Pick it up then wait around until the game ends
Note that if your mirrors pop and leave you in darkness at any point you can get the lantern out of your pack and turn it on

For help with the answers you can consult the Big Brain machine in the opposite end of the room
I could make a nice long list of the likely questions and give you the answers but Hey
This is Edutainment right
A little reading won't kill you
The card will only hold five charges each of which is used to unlock a door somewhere
Inside all the areas you can unlock are more charging machines where you can refresh the card
In case you run it empty and can't open any doors you can always get back to this one and renew the card
That's all to do in this room
For fun on the way out find the menu in the bookshelf
It's not important
Exit this building to the street
Turn right looking toward the original entrance F and look down at the manhole cover
Enter the sewer and at the dark area use the Phosphor Rods to illuminate the tunnels
Don't worry it's not a maze
Go F L F R F and open the door
Enter go around the
crystal ball and find the door on the other side of the room
Enter
Go left and find the console area and put the Plasma in the tube
Back up turn right and pull the lever
You have restored the electric power
You can see the crystal ball through the round window if you like
Exit this area back into the street
If you are curious the surveillance monitor is now working and you can see into several areas that you will eventually visit
Climb back up that original ladder and inside the room look right to find a machine
Pull the lever and the green light comes on
What have we done
Something good I hope
Go back into the street and up to the round B door
It's open just enough to slip through
Straight ahead if you look up you can see the tower where she is trapped
Can't get there from here
You may or may not see a robot walking around the far side
He may be going left he may be going right
Ignore him he's harmless
Turn right and go forward until you see a wooden door on the right
Go to it and use the key card to open it To the left is a machine that looks like a big iron stomach
I have often heard of a 'cast iron stomach' just never thought I'd really see one
To the right is a card charging machine and Big Brain
Straight in from the entrance is another door that is ajar
Slide through and go to the far side of the room
Find the two hotspots one for the stairs on the left and the other for the door on the right
On the right see the robot and look down at the floor to pick up the red object
It is calledDNA
Now go up those steps
To the left of the locked door is a device
You can examine close up the funnel area at the top or the spigot area at the bottom
Use the empty bucket on the spigot to fill it
Go back downstairs to the Iron Stomach
Pour the liquid into the funnel and wait for the process to finish
Digestion
Then take the bucket back and use it on the spigot on the lower portion of the stomach
Now go back upstairs and pour the finished product into the funnel
I don't even want to know what that stuff is
I hope it's oil
Actually it looks like baby food after it's been processed by the baby
Open the door by pulling one of the chains
Read the book for a clue
There is a picture of a machine and a temperature
That's Celsius of course and represents normal human body temperature
In the opposite corner is an oven
vent hood
that yields a red block Enzyme Turn left and read the book Codefor kitchen door is
Exit this area and to right another five steps to a metal door
Use the smart card to get in
Don't forget to recharge its memory while you are inside
Now this area is a little weird to find your way around
Look for the free standing room divider panels and go through the gap between them
You will find three desks each with an object within
A book shows theformulafor antibiotics Mould culture medium and a pipette with microorganisms
Other objects are a greenDNA piece and a mm slide
You can put the slide into theprojector DIA to see it
If it's a clue I am unable to interpret it
At the back of the room is a small elevator
You can't ride it up or down but you can send it up or down while you are not aboard
Send it down and step across it to find a ladder
Up you go into the next room and turn left
Uh Oh Poor fellow looks a bit undernourished
Take the blueEnzyme piece
Sort of looks like it would mesh with the other enzyme
Turn around to see the bookshelves that appear to be made out of an old barrel
Close up they reveal the titles
You need to click on six titles that have to do with cells in any order they are Nucleus Endoplasmic Reticulum Mitochondrion Chloroplast Dichtosome and Cell Wall
Into the kitchen you go
Go forward toward the other door then keep turning right all the way around the stove
In the open cabinet find a piece of paper with a clue Green Paddle Yellow Study Blue Outer Gate and Red Elevator
Whatever that means I'm sure we'll find out
Below the boarded up window you can look close up at what appears to be a soap dispenser but can't take it
There's nothing else to do in this room except use the code to exit into the dining area
Use the code to open the door
If for any reason you want to return upstairs it's possible to return via the ventilation shaft you came down
These buttons turn both ways so it's quick and easy
Two clicks on the upper left and one on the lower right will do it
Step in and immediately turn left
Open the trash can next to the refrigerator and take theCircle Open the fridge and take theMould Look at the dart board in the other end of the room
The ' ' is grayed out
Is that a clue
I'm not sure
See the machine near the kitchen passthrough
That was pictured on one of those clues
Put the two enzymes in the rectangular area set the temp to and press the button
Presto
It created a new key card for you
This one will open those big round doors and it comes fully charged
Don't forget to recharge it yourself after using it
Exit this room through the wooden door by flicking the switch next to the door
You will be able to re enter it from now on
Turn right and go to the next door the one with black and yellow striping around the perimeter
Use your new smart card to open it
Proceed to the next building
You can't seem to get in but there's that blue symbol that stands for 'Outer Gate '
Turn right go forward twice and find a window you can climb through
On the table is a device with buttons and a joystick
You can't do anything with it but on the far right in the shadows is the yellowDNA piece Near the door is a machine with six sliding levers
You are expected to know which represent Eucytes and which are Protocytes
No idea
Turn around and consult Big Brain
You learn that Protocytes are simple things like bacteria and Eucytes are multi celled animals likewalkthrough authors
Whenever you turn the Brain on there is a circular menu with Cellular Biology at the top
Select that and then the topic dealing with Protocytes and Eucytes the third line down
Learn what the terms mean and you will be able to set the levers
Actually it's the first three down and the second three up
Easy huh
Don't get smug
The fun's just beginning
When the panel opens you are confronted with the four symbols you have seen before and switches next to them
It seems we can turn on or off the access to the Outer Gate Blue the Paddle what's that
It's actually a locked door upstairs the Study the switch seems to be locked off and won't operate and the elevator
The door to our left seems to be locked
Here's the catch
You cannot select more that two switches
So let's do this
Turnonthe power to the elevator Red and the Outer Gate Blue
Exit the window and come in through the front door
Straight ahead is the elevator
On the way to the elevator turn right and observe the yellow symbol next to the door
Aha so that's the Study
Go into the elevator and go up by pressing the top of five buttons
Also press themiddle button to lock the elevator power in theOnposition
Straight ahead is the airlock we need to unlock
To the right is another machine where you select Eucytes etc
The symbols are the same the sequence is changed
This time it's and up and and down
Open the panel turnoffthe power to the Outer Door Blue and turnonthe power to the Study Yellow
Go back downstairs enter the study and turnonthe Paddle Green
Exit the study door just to your left
Eeek
A Robot
Don't worry he's harmless
Just click on him and he goes away
Return to the upstairs and go through the Airlock and into the laboratory
Straight ahead on the table read the note quot Gas Setting quot Don't take much note of that clue it seems to be a Red Herring
On the left side of the table take theFlask and on the right side take theCulture Medium
For a shortcut here are the buttons stepwise Exit the building through the window
You can exit via the door by activating it if you wish because now that the puzzle is solved you can turn on all the switches but you won't need to come back here
Back on the circular street find the door with the horizontal Y
Into the next door you find a gardeny area
A couple of fresh slips ofKudzuwould do very very well here
One wooden path leads to a metal ball covered with vines
Reminds me of my back yard
We probably will have to develop a way to get rid of the vines
Go into the building and answer a simple quiz on flower parts to gain access to the elevator
At the top read the book on the little table
taking note of the entry for May quot Heating the fertilizer made a substance that caused the plants to wilt quot A plan is born
Beyond the book is a control box with three valves
The left one is Hydrochloric Acid
Leave that one alone
The right one is Ammonia
Leave that one alone too although that is a component of fertilizer
Turn on the center valve Water
Enter the elevator and rotate it to the left
You are trying to get the plant to grow
In addition to the water it needs CO and Mineral Solutions
Turn on the gas press the button for Solutions and grow the plant
Observe the formula for sugar on the leaves
Then go back into the elevator rotate it right and look at the machine as you exit
Great
Another quiz
If you studied the chapter on photosynthesis you would recognize the process
The equation says carbon dioxide molecules and water molecules together with sufficient light and some help from a living plant will yield a sugar molecule waters and oxygens
Pretty useful stuff
To correctly complete the equation insert C H O on the left O in the center and H O on the right
Pull the lever to turn on the green light
There is a brain machine behind you if you need some help and a card charger to the left of the terrarium if you feel like answering some botany questions
Take thefertilizerfrom the round hanging safe
Take the elevator down and depart
Back on the circular street go left and find the door with the inverted Y
Inside the next building are several things to do
Charge up that card before you forget
Look for the hangingmonitorin the far corner
Turn it on and hear a Lion roar and see a graphic of the sound waves
Next to the card charger is the door to the lecture hall
Go in and find the main desk
Push the button to see a clue
It's not very obvious but it depicts the sequence of steps in Mitosis cell division
You can get the same information in clearer form from the Brain Machine
Now careful
This takes a bit of maneuvering
Go to the back row of seats and turn left
If you see a paper airplane on the seat you are in the right row
Go forward once then observe the cursor as it points down
It changes from a short finger back of hand to a long finger palm side if you search directly over the seat
If you looked carefully coming down the first ladder you saw the same hands
The short one turns you around the long one lets youlook down
Look down and takeCircle Okay return to the other room it's time to step into that round elevator and go up
Looking around there's what looks like an electric chair an electrified tunnel and a control panel probably for the tunnel
The control seems to be inactive and you can't get through the force field so let's get brave and sit in that chair
Click on the device overhead and find out that it's even worse than an electric chair it's another microbiology test
This one is related to the clue in the lecture hall
You will see three of the five steps to Mitosis depicted and you must choose the correct labels underneath each one
The questions are randomized each time you get into the chair and they are also scrambled when you choose a wrong answer
Here are the steps and a description of them Answering the questions correctly puts an end to the test and turns on the control panel
Here you must identify the four components of DNA and use them in the correct order
This puzzle is a bit unfair because one can't determine which switch goes with which other switch
We can learn from the Braniac that Adenine and Thymine always go to together and Cytosine and Guanine also but this seems to have very little to do with the puzzle on the machine
The sequence on the dials has to be G T A C Thus it appears that the two middle dials go together and the two outer ones
Even so only one solution is allowed though it would be logical to permit any correct combination of which there are many
After all that's the way genes work
Anyhow go through the glass tunnel
Find the freezer open it and take the blueDNA piece
From the freezer go left and enter the small room
Place the flask on the holder to the left and pour the fertilizer into the funnel
It heats up transfers to the flask and you can take theWilting Agent Exit this building back to Main Street and go right to the Horizontal Y door
Through the next door and find the metal ball smothered with vines
Use the wilting agent on the plants
Don't cringe when they make that strangling sound
Yeech
Open the device and use the four DNA pieces to further open it
Take theBall Before you leave take careful notice of the sequence of colors
Starting at the top and going clockwise the colors are Violet Blue Red Yellow Green Blue Yellow
Leave here and to back to the street
You have charged your smart card recently right
Turn right and find the door with the color lock
Use the ball to activate the lock and press the colors in sequence to open the door
In case you are color blind you can open it this way Think of the switches being at the and o'clock positions
Press
Inside find another Robot
He won't hurt you but he is in the way
He needs to be disabled somehow
Turn around and look at the wall to the right of the charge machine and find an open entrance to the ventilator shafts
About five steps in there is a toolbox with ascrewdriveryou can take
Pick it up and continue on
A couple more steps and you can look into a room on the right that is blocked by an inoperative fan
Another step there is a room on the right that is blocked by an operating fan
Perhaps there is a way to turn it off
Another step is a hangingmonitorthat displays a sound wave graphic and plays a frog croaking
Continue on and you will exit the shaft behind the robot
Use the screwdriver on his back
You have switched him off and he topples to the floor
One step forward and you can pick up theY Key Couple of steps toward the exit turn left and see themonitorwith a graphic and picture of an Eagle but no sound
Step over the robot again and you can enter the metal door
Inside see the dinosaur just for fun
Look left to see a door that opens by means of the beetle puzzle
Shades of Riven
Some study is necessary here what it wants is the number of species known to exist in each insect group
There is a Brain machine right behind you
Actually it only needs one correct answer but there are a dozen questions and a dozen answers so that makes possible combinations
Let me give you a couple so when they appear you have the answer Lepidoptera
Isoptera
Diptera
That should get you in
Check the hangingmonitorto hear the Eagle and see the graphic
To the right see the image on the blackboard for a clue
Note the number on the Bee's dance
It's worth a look at the Brain just to see the description of the Bee's dance
Turning toward the door see the control panel on the wall
Turn the switch off
This stops the fan in the ventilator shaft
I hope you're collecting these animal sound clues as we go
You can exit this building take the street to the right and find the XY door
Inside the building you find a card charger a locked cabinet and a puzzle
The six images represent the acetylcholine process whereby signals are passed through the nervous system
To read about it in the Brain go to Human Biology The Nervous System and forward five or six pages
The images are randomly placed each time you start the puzzle or answer it incorrectly so here are the descriptions
Number them accordingly Number the images correctly and the locked cabinet opens
Take theSyringe Now go into the next room straight ahead to the device in the center of the room
Open it and see theRobot Arm That arm is just crying out for an injection
Use the syringe to give it a shot in the arm and it releases awrench Take it
To the right of this device find a book lying on the chair
It tells of a secret lab and the code to get in Insert the slide into the projector and see another Bee's dance and a second number
Now that you have a wrench go back to the color lock door and crawl into the ventilation shaft
You can enter either end of the shaft now it's a bit shorter to go through behind the robot
Use the wrench on the bolt by the fan and enter the room
Go to the circular device on the floor
The two rings must be set according to the clue on the blackboard
Outer ring and inner ring
This is the first time I have ever seen an azimuth ring labeled counter clockwise
You have found the swimming pool
As soon as you are standing on the deck look up and to the right and take theNylon Cordfrom the hook
Then go forward to see anothermonitorwith an animal sound clue
It shows the Lion and plays the roaring sound
At the other end of the pool find the valves for Oxygen Hydrogen and Air
Turn on the air
Look to the right and put on theDiving suit Now you can go for a swim
Into the water and turn right toward the propeller
Use the nylon cord to stop the machinery and you can get through to thesecret lab Straight ahead open the safe with the code
Take two items from the middle shelf thePipetteand theCircle Up higher find themonitorwith the frog and graphic of its sound
Look around some more and find the book you can read
That's all here
Head back to the XY door
Go into the main room
If you wish you can show the slide in the projector
Go all the way to the back of the room to do the animal sounds puzzle
The three animal pictures you have seen are Frog Eagle and Lion
Select them in any sequence being sure NOT to use the reddish images rather the more true colors
In the center select the graphic that matches each animal and on the right select the correct sound
Click on the 'speaker' to play the sounds
If you happen to be deaf there is no way you can complete this puzzle without the help of someone who can hear the sounds
When all nine selections are correct the door will open
Inside is the machine that will create the desired antibiotic
Open the little drawer on the left and use the Mould on it
In the center drawer place the Culture Medium and on the right the Pipette
Step back once pull the lever and turn the spigot
Take the finishedPenicillin
Exit the building and at the street go right and find Door B where you first came in
Go into the Administration
building Whoops there's Robbie the Robot again and into the room around the left hand corridor
Straight in from the door is amachine
Use the penicillin on the machine and pull the lever sending up the penicillin
You get an immediate e mail saying she's much better thank you
Check thesurveillance monitorin the other room
It's a clue to the final puzzle Write the numbers down they differ from game to game
I believe the graphic showing the angles to set the circles does not vary
Go back outside through door B and once to the right
Look toward the center to find a device
Open it set your four numbers and place the three circles in the center
Rotate the circles by selecting the appropriate button and pressing a right or left green arrow
The inner circle goes to o'clock the middle circle to o'clock and the outer circle to o'clock
When everything's correct press the red button and enjoy the closing scene

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
Walkthrough by Peter J Hart Black Dahlia is a linear game in the true sense of the word
You cannot do certain things get certain items or go to specific places without having done certain other things first
The game is very rigid in this sense
A feature that you have to get used to in this game is clicking and sliding very similar to clicking and dragging
You will do this to items that you come across in the game and to certain items in your inventory itself
Doing this action often reveals something else
And speaking of inventory examine items carefully click on them to flip and turn them
With certain jigsaw puzzle interfaces clicking on a piece and holding will have that piece quot bump into quot other pieces Instead click on it and let go that piece now becomes your cursor and you can place it where you want except of course on top of another piece
And don't forget of course to explore your environment in detail look up look down scan all around
There will also be certain puzzles where there will be no particular sign that you have completed it if it looks complete to your eye then it probably is an example is a jigsaw puzzle
At the end of this walkthrough I've included some cheatcodes for what I consider to be some of the more difficult puzzles To use the cheatcodes just be in the close up of a given puzzle and then just type in the letters on your keyboard you won't see them appear on screen but the puzzle will be solved for you This walkthrough was made possible from all of the help I received from other gamers over at Gamenexus's message board this was a very challenging and difficult game at times and I couldn't have done it without them
Now on with the game After the opening movie sequence begin to explore your office
Click forward and head back behind your desk
Behind your desk tilt your view down and click open the center drawer read the little newspaper article
Then click on the little green book to the right and read the Preliminary Report
Then open the right hand desk drawer read the quot To Do quot list
Take note of one of the ones that is not checked it says to check back with professor Strauss
Put the quot To Do quot list back down but then click the mouse pointer on it HOLD and then slide it to the back of the drawer this reveals the gun
Click on it to take it in to your inventory
Then turn right to the file cabinet click on the little black book on the top of the stack of books on the file cabinet read the Fifth Column Lessons for America
Then open the top file drawer and read information inside Jim will note that it is a bunch of gibberish
You can if you want click on various parts of the book shelves though nothing on them is accessable right now this includes the little locked door drawer on the far end of the shelves
For now let's check out what's in the inventory
Click on your badge notice on the left hand side the little piece of silver metal sticking out click on it it's your lucky St Christopher's medal
Then click on your case file and click on and study the different aspects of it
Remember you can slide certain pages up amp amp down
Next examine your revolver notice when you put the cursor over the butt handle of the gun it turns into the pointing arrow
Click here HOLD and pull forward to the barrel of the gun
This reveals a key take key
Next click forward to that little locked door drawer at the end of the shelves by the door to your office
Get in a close up and USE the key
Click on the message on the left by Dr Strauss then click on notes on the bottom
Study these cryptic writings carefully the numbers and letters on the left refer to a phone dial
Especially notice the little scribbling that says and then or
Next click on your office door and go to Sullivan's office Talk to Sullivan
When you're asking about the case file click on the document that says Initial Crime Report
Then move your cursor down to the bottom across the signature and it will say Ask about detective click on this
Then move your cursor up top until it says Ask about Finster click on this
When he asks you to look at the invitation and asks what you make of it choose response Tell him it looks like facist propaganda
Next access your World Map and go to Finster's office Talk to Finster
When finished talking with him access your World map and go to police station and Detective Merylo's office Talk to Merylo
Now remember the detective said you can look at the mug book if you want to
Tilt your view down and to the left click on the mug book
When book is open click on paper on top to take it into your inventory
Page through book and make note when you come to Louis Fisher the man with the bushy beard
So in inventory you now have Finster's stationary
Next access your World Map and go to McGinty's bar If you want you can try talking to the bartender about the foreman but he won't be very cooperative
Instead turn towards your right and go to the man sitting in the back by himself talk to him
Winslow mentions Black List to you
Now access your World Map and go to Sullivan's office Talk to Sullivan
When you get the Black List go back to your office Go back behind your desk
This is where you have to use a quot special code quot for getting Strauss's phone number
Bring up Black List and in inventory slide the list up to the top of the screen and at bottom of list see Dr Karl Strauss note that his number says CLV
Now remember those cryptic scribblings you found in the locked door drawer on the shelves
For the first part of Strauss's phone number the CLV part on a phone C L and V therefor
Then the other scribbling on the page said
So with
All total you now have
So the first three digits are
Then you have the rest of the number to figure out
The other scribblings said either or use which is subtract With that becomes with it's with it's All together you have
Combined with the previous figure you now have
Now click on the telephone on your desk and dial this six digit number
The person on the other end eventually tells you that Strauss isn't there right now Now if you haven't done so yet and who knows maybe you have in your explorations go to your office door and click on the light switch there to bring some illumination on the scene not that it was impossible to see without them on
Then turn and face your desk from the doorway and tilt your view up and look at the light source you should see some shadows inside of the light shade click on them Examine these in inventory you will now have parchment sheets and the bag of runes Special Note If you want in inventory you can click on the bag of runes to open it and examine them
But it is strongly recommended that you DO NOT try to manipulate them yet by putting the symbols onto that gem shape in the middle
Yes this will eventually have to be done in the game but not until much much later almost near the end
This is mentioned because this game has been known to have a quot bug quot here when played on some systems
What will happen is the rune symbols if you put them on the gem shape now will get stuck there and you won't be able to get them off later when you need it
So to save yourself the trouble and not lose any progress you will make don't try to assemble the runes now wait until the appropiate time
Now access your World Map and go to Detective Merylo's office Ask Merylo about Special Agent Winslow

Click on the stained glass pieces to bring up the puzzle interface
One of the crests is almost already done for you
Now assemble the pieces so that you have all four crests It doesn't matter in which order you do them or where you place them at on the board
Clicking on a piece then holding will drag it but it will quot bump quot into other pieces
Clicking on a piece and letting go has the piece become your cursor you can now place it wherever you want except of course on top of another piece
One of the ways you can check on your progress is to look for the embedded words in the stained glass using the red filter light located hanging above the table you are working on
Don't worry about backing out of the puzzle interface you won't lose any of your progress the puzzle does not quot reset quot
So when you click on the lamp hanging above the table you are looking for four words names embedded in the stained glass
So when you've completed the puzzle and all four shields crests are represented look through the lamp filter above the four names you should see are Landolph Fischterwald Finsterlau and Mulhaven

You can rsquo t move the barrel so you pierce it with the iron bar and you wait until everything pours out of it

Therefore you examine the trolley carefully and discover that its brakes have been applied
Remove whatever is stopping the trolley and give it a push

Summer I make things hard I make things gold I make both rich and poor so I am told
I am loved but come not too close for too close will ruin all but do without and death will befall Fire
Autumn I have wings guess me child yet only in circles fly
And sing I do when the wind calls me as it goes passing by

Valentina scolds and warns Adrian about carrying a sword
Open the door Talk to Valentina and then ask for her dagger
Adrian wounds himself
Adrian remembered that he was wounded when he wanted to help Angelina
He touched the door and it opened the blood of the male Gordons
Black Mirror Adrian and Valentina look at the mirror
Mordred's shade is reflected between them in the mirror
Don't touch the mirror ever What is in Adrian is the shade of Mordred soul
They need to send Mordred's shade to join Mordred's soul in the mirror
Mordred's book Valentina asks about the book
New writing appears in the book
Mordred writes that it is possible for the soul in the mirror to leave the mirror if its shade is bound in the world
Mordred wants to bring King Armundor's soul out of the mirror and place it in his son's body
Mordred used Armundor's bones on the altar so that Armundor's shade be bound to his own bones
Then Mordred killed his own son to release the son's soul and leave an empty body
Adrian realizes that that is the Gordon curse
Mordred lured him male Gordon to the mirror so that his soul that is in the mirror can come out and join the shade that is already in Adrian's body
Valentina's plan As Valentina Automatically change to Valentina
Valentina starts to formulate a plan
Examine the black mirror Click on Black Mirror
She wants to send Mordred's shade back to the mirror but wonders if there are other shades in Adrian's body
She asks Adrian to read about shades in the Book of the Guardians
Shades are born in death forced into this world
They can neither be caught nor appeased
But the green flame unsettles them
So shades are born in death but behind the mirror
Examine the altar Click on altar
Mordred's soul is in the mirror
If Adrian should die here Mordred's soul will take over Adrian's body
Mordred's shade has to be taken out of Adrian's body
They have to be sure that Mordred's soul can't leave the mirror and Adrian's soul not leave his body
Soul transfer Go to the laboratory and automatically asks Adrian if there are more writings in the book
Mordred cannot revive the boy after he killed him for the transfer
He created a shade for his sword which means he can use his sword on the other side of the mirror
If he enters the mirror without dying he can use the sword and rule both sides of the mirror
The blade has a black stain and it is spreading
Valentina asks about the ritual for the soul transfer
Examine the swords Check the swords that Adrian touched when Mordred came out
Valentina realizes that Adrian needs a sword to fight at the other side We need Mordred's sword
Examine the alchemy table and poison Check alchemy table on the left
Valentina thinks that she can release Adrian's soul by poison to fight Mordred with the sword
If he dies the adrenaline boost will resuscitate him later
Check Mordred bones Go back to the church at right
Look in Mordred's sarcophagus
Valentina thinks that they should use Mordred's bones to lure Mordred's shade out of Adrian's body just like Mordred tried to do to the king's body
Valentina asks Adrian to move the bones to the altar later
Valentina's plan Valentina explains what happens to souls that die close to the mirror
The good souls fly free while the bad souls are trapped in the mirror
The shades of good and bad souls are formed behind the mirror
Souls in the mirror are slaves to the shades
Mordred soul is defenseless in the mirror
They need to bind Mordred's shade to his remains here
The shade cannot go back to the mirror then
Adrian's shade can now enter the mirror and fight Mordred's soul
Adrian has to die in order to go through the mirror to do this
Valentina will resuscitate Adrian with the adrenaline
Mordred's shade will be held on this side by trapping the shade in his bones
They need a sword that is usable on the other side
They need Mordred's sword since it already has a shade on the other side
The sword is in the Tea room and is the cause of the mold fungus that bothered the castle workers
Adrian needs to lay out Mordred's bones while Valentina gets the sword and check about the poison in the library
Mordred's bones Chapel Check Mordred's sarcophagus
Adrian wants to know the arrangement of the bones
Use the Polaroid camera with the sarcophagus
Adrian takes apicture of Mordred's skeleton
TakeMordred's skeletonnow
Altar Go to the altar in front of Black Mirror
Place the skeleton on the altar
Arrange Mordred's bones Using the photo as guide arrange Mordred's bones
Click hold drop the bones in place
See white circles that forms where the bone can be dropped
Drop the bone when the circles are made into one
As additional help use the stains on the bones as markers to know which side of the bone is the correct one
The bones can be turned by right clicking them
Take note of the wide ends or other bone characteristics to match the bones
When correctly done a sound is heard and automatically pull back
If not start over Yup that looks right
Get Mordred's sword Change to Valentina
Be at the Tea Room
Look at the black stain on the wall
Use the dagger on the black stain
TakeMordred's sword with a broken tip
Exit the room and automatically be back with Adrian
Ritual Automatically be Adrian
Talk to Valentina
Poison Automatically be Valentina and is at the lab
Check the alchemy table and Valentina picks up thepoison
That was quick
Go back to Adrian at the altar
Kill Adrian See Adrian lying on the table with Mordred's bones
Use the sword on the table or Adrian
Valentina gives the poison to Adrian
Valentina watches the mirror and does not see Adrian but Mordred
As soon as the fight is over use the adrenaline on Adrian
The last of the Gordons has done it
After the credits watch Adrian updates his diary
Later he will add to the Book of the Guardian
Read the diary for the explanation of what happened at the Chapel Black Mirror and Gordon Family
Adrian explains about the black balls
It is used to trap and control shades
It's your job to stop them

I tried it before figuring out the correct conversation sequence
It got quite frustrating

Ask him how he knew

Tell him he's dead

You aren't going

Repeat yourself
Tom

Exhaust all conversation options with Paul Meltzer at the conclusion he will give you a business card with their Bmail address
B Mail seems to be some cheap version of E mail based upon the way the brothers talk about it
When you exit you are asked if Joey should stay behind to spy chose yes
He needs to discover the B mail password
It is TENNIS Joey does not hear the login but somehow you know it is is PAULM
At home there is no conversation between Rosa and Joey about the login and password
You see no indication of how she learned it but she did
Log out of Rosa's B mail account then log into Meltzer's using the login and password yes typing in all caps works
Read all of his B mail when finished Joey will suggest you go to the gallery for the opening

If you miss the profiting line the following conversation mentioning the password will not occur
Leave the room and have Joey eavesdrop
Overhear Paul call Charlie quot Scooter quot recall from emails that Charlie sent an email to Paul reminding him that his email password is his childhood nickname
If the password is not a part of the conversation between the brothers go back and question again
Return to home

the Blackwell legacy Another walkthrough by Myst This walkthrough will be posted on www Gameboomers com if you got it read it anywhere else the admin or postmaster of the site has hopefully asked for permission and I would like you to do the same if you want to post it on your site I not a difficult person I just have to write this just in case
The is made by Wadjet eye gameshttp www wadjeteyegames com The story as described on wadjeteyegames com The Blackwell Legacyis the first case in a miniseries of games that stars a medium named Rosangela Blackwell and her spirit guide Joey Mallone
Their mission it seems is to assist tormented spirits and investigate supernatural goings on
They don't understand why they are thrown together but they do the best they can The duo's first case will involve a series of suicides at a local university
Something unnatural has forced these students to kill themselves and nobody knows why
Rosangela who is just coming to terms with her new status as a medium finds herself cast as the unwilling detective in this gruesome mystery The game A simple yet fun game it has the looks of an old dos game even though it was released in
But that doesn't drag the game down one bit it just adds nostalgia
The controls Point and click it can't be more simple
The inventory is accessed by panning the mouse pointer to the top of the screen here you can also access options and your notebook
Walkthrough Day So let's get started
In the first cutscene Rosa Rosangela spreads the ashes of her aunt from the queens bridge I think but that's is not important when she walks away from the bridge you can see her spirit raise and disappear in the air
When you re in control you find yourself in front of your apartment building go and talk to the teenager in front of the door Jim Bundo I think he won't let you in because her doesn't believe that you live in the building you find out that he's standing in for the regular doorman because of a strike that has something to do with the union
It doesn t really matter what you say to him to proof that live in the building because he thinks he knows everybody that live there he also thinks your apartment is empty
Talk to him until he tells you that Nishanthi Sharma your neighbor which you have never seen or spoken to can vouch for you she is use surely in Washington park
Now we gotta find her exit the scene by walking to the left or right go to Washington park
Go to the left to the fountain and get a headache right before you leave the scene what a great day we are having
Go a little to the right and see Nishanthi playing some kind of flute don't bother talking to her because you can't muster up the courage to do it instead lure the dog around the lamp so he gets stuck and begins to bark now you learn that it's Nishanthi's dog Moti she frees him and and you talk to her
Talk about what ever until you go back to the little runt in front of the door and Nishanthi vouches for you and you are free to choose who to response to Jim before you enter I like to give him the angry one That little brat
In the hallway you talk to Nishanthi about stuff and she says that you are free to visit her any time after the talk you enter your apartment after asking her to call you a shorter name
After complaining for a while the phone rings it's doctor Donald Quentin the M D
for your aunt until she died talk to him and he invites you to his office p s
you have a letter from him in you inventory read it if you want exit your apartment and go to the Bellevue hospital go to the right and talk to the guard and say that you want to see doctor Quentin and the guard asks if he is expecting you and you show the letter and get to enter the office of doctor Quentin
Talk to him about your aunt Joey the future and links to be short just talk about everything
Then leave and return to you apartment pick up the envelope on the floor and read or skip your way through it to get some pictures
Now the phone rings again and this time it's your boss bob from the paper you work for as a book reviewer he tells you to look in to a suicide at the NYU dorm after complaining about it and getting nowhere Rosa takes her notebook exit the apartment and go to the dorm
At the dorm your headache starts to get bigger go the far left and knock click on Kelly and Joann's door Kelly opens talk to her until the notebook shows up with the Joann slept all night and Joann studied all day added at the bottom
Click the red X to finish the conversation and go to the far right and talk to The R A he's in his room
And click the Joann slept all night to get Kelly slept elsewhere open your notebook and click on Joann slept all night and Kelly slept elsewhere to get Did Kelly lie to me
Go back to Kelly and talk to her and ask if she lied know just talk about all the other things on your notebook
After that exit and go to your apartment use the computer to write your article
When Rosa's done she'll get a gruesome headache and wants some fresh air exit and go across the hall to Nishanthi's apartment go inside and talk to her about all that you can
You learn why the dog park has been closed the officials say that it has something to do with high pitch sounds that causes the dogs pain but the dogs wasn't in pain they were sacred of something and you will soon learn of what offer to feed the dog and you will get a biscuit just hold on to it for now and exit and go back to your apartment
When you get back your headache will explode and then go away you see that the picture on the TV glows Rosa looks at it and see the picture of her aunt and herself and then a third person appears in the picture and blue man Rosa is shocked and begins to walk around the room and tries to calm herself when Joey appears and she collapses
Talk to Joey and when he asks about when your headache started answer Washington park you talk about the dog run response in anyway and accept you go to the in front of the dog run and Joey tells Rosa to look at the dog run and she sees a ghost
Joey goes to talk to the ghost ask any thing you want but she just babbles about HIM whoever he is and poison so Joey goes back to Rosa and talks to her but she doesn't want to accept that she just saw and talked to a ghost so she heads home and goes to bed
Day When Rosa leaves her bedroom she is sorry to see that Joey is still there they start to talk
When you talk to Joey he tells you about the powers you have he then asks you to pull his tie it's not a metaphor
You now get rammed inside your own head you get thrown on the floor next to the portal
This room in your head is the gateway to the other world or to be more specific they have to walk through the light classic
After you talk to Joey about the Portal and learn that it was because of this room entering your head that you had headaches
Once outside of your head you'll talk to Joey about how to get the ghost to accept death and he tells you that you have to make them snap it of the madness they are trapped in use surely something that reminds them who they are
Remember to talk about Joey and talk about ghostly powers you'll need it later

Moti starts barking at Joey when you enter but Joey puts the little bastard in his place
Put the pill in the dog biscuit and talk click on to Moti offer to give a treat he has to pee and you offer to take him outside you automatically go to the dog park and talk to Alli
She regain her mentality or something like that you pull her inside your head and send her to the other side
Go back to the hospital
Walk over to the guard and wait for Joey to walk hover next to the desk this will interfere with the radio
When the guard fiddles with the radio trying to get it to work you can grab one of the keys Rosa takes the fuse box key go to the far left and open the fuse box and use it to turn off the lights once they are out hide in the corner with the phone
When the guard is past you go to Susan's room and the deacon appears he's one whimpy ghost
Interrupt his little plead ceremony and just let Joey handle it all the way you can handle it your way by talking but I like to see the bastard get his ass kicked
When Joey finally gets through to the deacon you pull him in on the inside you talk to the deacon and suddenly a demon appears talk to the demon and ask about his reasons then talk to the deacon and ask about the flak
Open your notebook and combine the two only things in there and tell the deacon to drop the flask smash it with the stone and it's done cheesy ending

Ask her about herself
When she stops filling you in show her the picture of the scar faced man
She says its Moerlin
He's a fellow guest at the hotel Great you are on the right track George Ask Lady Piermont about the clown nose Then below ask about the scar faced man until the icon disappears Then ask about Lady Piermont again She'll tell you she's found the man she's been waiting for all her life only to be bitterly disappointed
When she has finished trying to talk a hole in you excuse yourself and go to the front desk You can't speak with the gentleman reading the newspaper quite yet You need to get access to that safe and those mysterious documents When you get to the front desk look to rear screen and check out the blue key hanging on the board That looks like a likely target for George
Try to get the key off the board The desk clerk will stop you Chat with him about the safe key Plantard and the clown You will find out that the key is for room Its now empty though reserved Hmmm interesting
On your way back over to Lady Piermont for a continuing conference stop and talk to the gentleman with the newspaper He's a Nobel Prize winner Might he be in the same danger at the Hotel Ubu as Plantard faced at the cafe
Afterward talk to Lady Piermont Ask her about the key You make an agreement with her to distract the desk clerk When Piermont does her thing with the desk clerk take that KEY Go directly up the stairs You know that the scar faced assassin Moerlin is staying in the second room on the right side according to Todryk the tailor
So going into the first room on the right side just may help you gain access to the next room Check the sign on the door by attempting to enter
Yup its Room all right
Use the key to enter
You can spend some time snooping around in the amoire and checking out the bedside table
But you really just need to go right on out the bedroom window
Oh gad
One false move and you are sky diving toast Creep along the ledge screen right until you can climb in the assassin's window
Go over and open the door to the hallway only to see the scar faced assassin arriving You're automatically hiding in the amoire while the assassin changes his clothes and leaves the room again
Whew
Check out the room
The bed side table is the only item that is accessible other than well maybe those ridiculous clown pants on the bed Search them to find Moerlin'sPASS CARDand an interesting lookingMATCHBOOK

When you have theMANUSCRIPTin your inventory go up the stairs Enter the first room again and climb out on the ledge Use the magnifying glass icon to throw the manuscript out into the alley
Go back inside down to the lobby and out the front entry On your way you'll be stopped by the two thugs Guido and Flap who were obviously stationed there by Moerlin Flap will search you
Aren't you glad I told you to dump that manuscript out the window
Go back in the alley and collect the manuscript
You will appear in Nico's apartment
You learn from Nico that the medieval manuscript is connected somehow with the ancient order of the Templars
After learning about the Templars view the manuscript at screen bottom and review the meaning of each of the icons You may do this periodically as you develop additional information But it is not necessary to repeat this frequently to successfully finish the game
Leave the apartment for Part Crune Museum Enter the museum and talk to the guard Ask for Andre Lobineau Also ask him about the Knights of the Templars and the manuscript Lobineau is not at the museum and the guard knows a grand total of zero
Check out the exhibits in the display area eventually making your way to the strange triangular object in the center glass case Wow It looks like the tripod depicted on the Templar manuscript
Could it be

And go through the icons on the manuscript again if you need further familiarization Then leave Nico and head for the Aeroport on the map When the Europe map pops up click on Lochmarne CHAPTER TWO IRELAND Part The Pub Go talk to the young man leaning against the building Liam McGuire is a virtual stranger to the truth as it turns out But ask him about Peagram the dig Lochmarne the clown and the ghost After the discussion with McGuire go into the pub

Go to rear screen and talk to O'Brien who is sitting on the end bar stool by the window Ask him about Peagram Michael Peagram the gem Lochmarne the tripod and the ghost Then go back outside and talk to McGuire again about the dig Fitzgerald and the gem Looks like Peagram gave old Fizzy a package that he is very nervous about
Go back inside and approach Fitzgerald again Ask him about the dig Peagram the package and Jacques Marquet Fitzgerald jumps up and runs out of the pub You hear brakes squealing McGuire runs into the pub to tell everyone that Fitzgerald haas been run down by a red sports car
Go outside and talk to McGuire
He tells you Fitzgerald was hit and then pulled into the car before it drove off by a bloody pixie
Ask him about the pixie and Fitzgerald
Now remember in the cutscene where you saw the pixie's red sports car bump the pub wall and knock the hatch off a small compartment mounted there Look at it now to the left of the pub entry The workings are exposed What do you think these switches are for One of the handles comes off when George touches it
Uh oh
Go back inside and ask Michael for a beer
You need one here You won't get one if you ordered one earlier however Finish it off first if that is the case Michael discovers then that the beer taps aren't operating Oh so that's what you broke He mentions the glass washer
You can see it vibrating as it runs behind the bar
At this point show Michael your electrician's ID card The glass washer has stopped So he wants you to take a look at it first to prove yourself before you are allowed to try to fix the beer pumps Walk around to the back of the bar and use the piece of wire from your inventory on the electrical outlet for the glass washer This won't work unless you have talked to the sneezing old man specifically about this wire and what it is used for Ugh poor little animals
So if you didn't get that information out of him the first time go talk to him about it now
When you are able to use the wire as a replacment for the fuse you'll have a conversation with Michael about fixing the beer pumps in the cellar
He will step back to the bar so you can enter the doorway to the cellar Go to the lever on the cellar wall to screen right and pull it Then go back up to the bar and out onto the street Open the grate on the sidewalk Kahn will approach you inquiring about a small package When he leaves go back to the pub's cellar You will automatically pick up theFLASHLIGHT the GEM and exchange words with McGuire above about free beer and his reconaissance on the bad guys Take the green bar towel out of your inventory and get it wet under the utility sink's faucet

You can barely see it
Walk over and knock it down Then pick it up and notice those little holes in the sand Pour some plaster of paris in the holes and wring out the green bar towel full of water to wet the plaster
If the towel has dried out too much take yourself back to the pub's cellar and wet it again a time or two
Note If you didn't turn the faucet off after you wet the bar towel the first time when you got the gem and the flashlight you will never be able to get the towel wet enough to dampen the plaster in the excavation
You will be going back and forth to the excavation trying to get the towel wet enough until the cows come home So be sure to turn off the water after you use it
After you successfully wet the plaster of paris in the holes in the sand pick up thePLASTER CASTFrom the sand Use the plaster cast on the left wall beside the door where you found the little holes When the door opens enter the cavern

You can't go anywhere back here in the wards yet so use the uppermost right screen exit behind Sam to get back to the hospital lobby Go to the old man with the white moustache Dr Hagenmeyer Afterward go back down to the wards where you found Sam Benoir the nephew will follow you and you will end up in Grendel's ward J Two where Marquet is supposedly recovering The very stern Nurse Grendel gives you instructions and aBLOOD PRESSURE CUFF
Talk to the patients The man in the middle bed tells you that Marquet's room is around the corner in solitary After all conversation try to go front screen and right to Marquet's room The patient in the first bed stops you After your unsatisfactory encounter with him speak to Benoir at the foot of the bed As him about Marquet and Grendel Give Benoir the blood pressure cuff and tell him to use it on the man pictured in the center icon at the bottom of your screen Eric Sopmarch Benoir will then take Eric's blood pressure

Then the ominous little group sails away in a small boat
Go down the long series of steps Hmmm interesting looking ceremonial circle here Put the tripod on the center post
Put the gem on the tripod The lettersM A R I Bwill be revealed

Nejo is his name Ask him about the Templars the knights and his stand Ask him about himself and the stand again
When the conversation icons are completed show Nejo the red ball you got as a souvenier from the juggler at Montfaucon Nejo loves it I mean he really loves that red ball He wants it desperately He offers a service in trade for the red ball Remember this offer
Go talk to the fat man in the green and yellow outfit That's American tourist par excellence Duane Henderson Ask him about Nejo Templars medieval weaving knight the bull and Duane himself last On the second pass talk to him about his wife Pearl and then himself again
Go talk to Pearl at the nearby antique shop Ask her about medieval weaving herself Duane the Templars and Nejo She will ask you if you want to listen to one of her poems Here's some good news you don't have to Listening to Pearl's poetry is not mandatory to successfully completing the game
Go screen extreme right after talking to Pearl to the darkened stairway in the arch Go up the stairs Look at the carpet seller and note the pattern on the red rug behind him with the diamond pattern Something is very familiar about that pattern Aha It's the same pattern as the matchbook in your inventory The carpet seller mentions Alamut Didn't Marquet talk about Alamut at the hospital The carpet seller pulls the carpet back to display another set of steps Go on up Its the Club Alamut
Talk to Ultar the taxi driver Next ask him about the bartender Nejo Templars and the American tourists
Try talking to the bartender
You'll find him fairly unresponsive as his tongue has been removed poor man
Try the door over screen right It's locked The taxi driver tells you that it's the bathroom Move George out of the way and use the magnifying glass to try to read the note on the door Go back to Ultar the taxi driver and talk to him about the sign Something about a stolen toilet brush Fairly heavy retribution for a stolen toilet brush Afterward show him the picture of Khan He's been in Marib And he's been asking around about George The ultimate destination appears to be Bull's Head Ask him about Bull's Head when the icon appears When you are asked you definitely want to go up there Maybe if you find that brush the bathroom will become accessible and Ultar will be more agreeable about the taxi ride
Go back downstairs and out into the marketplace again Go to the kebab stall Use the magnifying glass to check the kebabs very carefully See the toilet brush there to the left on top under the roasting kebabs
It looks like a baby bottle brush
He's using the toilet brush from the Alamut to baste his kebabs
Oh gad
Go extreme screen left and talk to Nejo about the Americans Ultar and the kebab salesman Arto Then show Neho the ball again He'll say You know I do sir
Click the ball on him again and talk to him about the toilet brush Maybe Nejo can help with a trade or something
He wants that red ball desperately When Nejo says Can I have the ball back mister
Answer yes thumbs up Give him the ball He mentions an Arabic phrase il ak kl' klab that he says you should go use on Arto
Note Giving the ball to Nejo will not happen unless you have right clicked on Arto at the kebab stand and have heard from George all about the horrific truth The guy was basting the kebabs with the toilet brush
When you have the Arabic phrase from Nejo go talk to Arto and left click on him
Use the Arabic phrase icon Wow what a reaction Yikes But the ploy was effective It got Arto away from the kebab stand so Nejo could pop over they and pick up that toilet brush He has indeed performed a service for you
Go back down to the marketplace and talk to Nejo Arto will not bother you again Nejo gives you the TOILET BRUSH Go back up the stairs to the Alamut and give the toilet brush to Ultar Then give it to the Alamut's owner He'lll take the brush and give you a set of KEYS to the bathroom door
Go use the keys on the door
Inside take theCHAINfrom the toilet stall and use the keys on the drying towel machine at left to remove theROLLER TOWEL
Go back to Ultar Ask him about Bull's Head and the meaning of the phrase you used on Arto Oh No wonder Arto went ballistic Guess you still need to figure out some way to scrape up for that taxi ride to Bull's Head
Go back to the now deliriously happy ball playing Nejo Talk to him about the smelly cat Pet the smelly cat and then immediately ring that silver bell sitting on the left of the table The cat will knock off a small gray statue that was on the top shelf behind the table A man in a red shirt will briefly make an appearance from the stall door Pick up the littleSTATUEwhich fell off the table to George's right
In inventory clean up the little statue with the dirty tissue you've been carrying around for ages
Now it appears you have done a fairly effective job of making the statue look old perhaps ancient How about selling it to someone who likes ancient stuff Like maybe Duane and his wife Pearl Go talk to Duane Click on the statue to offer it to him for He gives you the MONEY
Hooray You have your taxi fare to Bull's Head to check out what's up there that Kahn was so interested in But first ask Duane about Bull's Head Ultar and Arto Leave Duane and go back to the Alamut to find Ultar Show him the money
Answer Yes to his question Are you adventurous
Ultar leaves ahead of you and you leave the bathroom keys on the bar
At the truck talk to Ultar about the taxi He's got a problem The fan belt is broken Give Ultar the roller towel you took from the Alamut bathroom You now haveHALF A ROLLER TOWEL Off you go to Bull's Head Part Bull's Head At the top of Bull's Head save your game Walk to the little tree at the edge of the cliff See that darker area to screen right of the tree Its a deep hole Use the hand icon on the tree to get aSTICK Combine it in inventory with the half a roller towel Walk over to the deep hole and use the towel and stick apparatus on the big crack at the side of the hole Climb into the hole using the gears icon
Over toward the rear of the screen under the rock where the little tree is just above you you will see a hole in the rock It's to the left of the corner area Use the magnifying glass icon to look in there
You'll discover a wide metal ring Pull the ring and enter the new doorway that appears on George's right
Uh oh
Klausner's body And double Uh Oh the door closes You're locked in Might as well check Klausner's body You will find a hard LENS Save your game Examine the Baphomet image and try to memorize the inscription which means to the west to the edge of the world you don't need to memorize it really
You are interrupted by Kahn After the preliminaries follow him outside
If you have a clue as to what might be good for you use the angel icon to answer all of his questions truthfully Then offer to die like a man
When it is time to shake hands with Kahn quickly get your palm buzzer out from the costume shop and use it on Kahn to shake hands Then very quickly run to the edge of the cliff and jump right off If you're fast enough you'll land on Ultar's truck and off you go back to Paris Part Paris Back in Nico's apartment you'll talk over all the events in Marib and proceed to the Crune Museum
Talk to Lobineau about the Baphomet inscription Ask him about Philip le Bel and Pope Clement including the plot to get the Templar's treasure Ask him about the manuscript You learn that the knight is Spanish Maybe the manuscript is a map to the hidden Templar treasure Maybe it's buried in Spain Go to the airport and select Villa De Vasconcellos CHAPTER SIX SPAIN Part The Villa Talk to Lopez the gardener watering the lawn Speak to him about the Templars and the Countess de Vasconcellos It doesn't matter how you approach this guy As far as he is concerned you aren't seeing the Countess

Walk over to the side of the villa You should get a gears icon on the hose just below the spot where it goes through the window Use the blood pressure cuff on the hose
When the gardener discovers your trick and goes into the villa's laundry room follow him inside and go quickly down the corridor to the right of the suit of armor When the dogs discover you and start yapping their heads off you will automatically come back out into the corridor As soon as you have an active cursor click on the suit of armor George will duck behind it Stay there When the old gardener challenges you and then goes on down the corridor to calm the dogs make a hasty track up the stairs

She orders old Lopez to get the chess set from her quarters While George is waiting the Countess offers the sad local legend of the children's disappearance and Don Carlos' sojourn to find them
Note When the so called Chess Puzzle appears on your screen here's the methodology
It doesn't play at all like chess
You deal only with the three white pieces in the center vertical column the Bishop the Knight and the King No other pieces can be moved
You move the three white pieces by clicking on the square base not on the figure itself
CHESS PUZZLE SOLUTION There are five vertical squares in the center column
Number them from the top to the bottom
The Bishop with cross goes in square The Knight with hood goes in square The King with crown goes in square Once the puzzle is solved a niche in the wall will open revealing a very meaningful ancient chalice
You return to Nico's apartment for another round of conversation about your trip to Spain Afterward leave for CHAPTER SEVEN MONTFAUCON RETURN Part The Plaza Talk to the policeman again He is undercover on the Sewer Jacques case
Go up the stairs and enter the church Show the chalice you got from the Countess to the priest Let him clean it off While he's rubbing the years away go screen right and look at the floor tombs under the windows

Use the lens on the scroll Look at the windows again You see a knight burning alive A Templar no doubt There's also an important date to be seen MCCCXIV or

Talk to the guard again and ask him to open the bathroom He gives you hisKEYS Open the bathroom door and step inside Check out the boiler toilet garbage etc Get theBAR OF SOAPfrom the sink
The icon to pick up the soap is a bit tricky here a pixel hunt
How about using that bar of soap to make an impression of the keys
Combine them in inventory Now you have a good impression of the key to that mysterious locked door Now use the soap on the plaster to get the plaster into the impression Then hold the soap bar under the water to make aPLASTER KEY Take it to the hand dryer dry it and replace the soap Now you need to make the plaster key look real so you can fool the guard and use the real key to access the excavation site
Go back to the guard and give him the real key Go up the stairs and try to get some gray paint on the key from the paint can hanging on the yellow and black barricade Whoops The workman gets cranky Go down to the cellar to the phone
Call Nico Have her stay on the line so you can set up the painter to get him away from the paint can Go up and tell him he's got a phone call He can't pass it up
When he is gone get that key and dip it in the paint
Go back down to the cellar and get the bathroom key from the guard again
Go into the bathroom Swap the fake key for the real thing Don't give it back to the guard yet Go out to the thermostat on the wall to the left of the radiator Right click on it for an explanation Then go talk to the guard about the thermostat Go turn the thermostat off
Right click on the thermostat again to hear that its getting quot chilly quot The guard will put on his gloves Now give him the fake key He can't feel that it is fake with his gloves on
Voila
Call Nico again Ask her to distract the guard Wait till he goes up to get the painter George watches the guard and painter argue and then goes back to the cellar
Go use the real key on the excavation door Look at the Baphomet idol Use the chalice on the design on the floor in front of the idol You'll see an image of a church with a square tower

Mechanical device room Look around the room and study the giant mechanical devices
Note the placements of the crystals and holes in all of them
The one closest to the next room cannot be moved
The next room that has a lightning insignia over the arch is full of crystals that are not activated
Go to the control console at other end of the mechanical device room
Mechanical device puzzle The object of this puzzle is to combine all the mechanical devices into one by inserting one after another to bring energy to activate the crystals in the next room
Standing on the console the immovable mechanical device is the one at NE position
The console is operated by pressing S to rotate the energy flow that will move a device to the center
Once a device is at the center it can be rotated using A or W The devices should fit with the protruding part inserted to another
SE Mechanical device Press arrow A or W to change the flow of energy from SE to NW
Press S to move SE device to center
Press the arrows to rotate SE device to a position wherein the protruding part faces the unmovable NE device
This also diverts the flow of energy from SW to NE
Press the S gear icon to move SE device to join the NE device
Hey it worked
NW Mechanical device Press arrow A or W to change the flow of energy from NW to SE
Press S to move NW device to center
Press the arrows to rotate NW device to a position wherein the protruding part faces the unmovable joined NE devices
This also divert the flow of energy from SW to NE
Press the S gear icon to move NW device to join the NE devices
SW Mechanical device We have to turn SW device by pressing S to bring it to the center
Press arrow to rotate SW to a position wherein the protruding part faces the unmovable joined NE devices
Press the arrow to change the flow of energy from SW to NE
Press S gear to move SW device to join the NE devices
Watch to see the flow of energy shoots out to the next room
Go to the joined mechanical devices and look at the control panel on the first part of the devices
Operating the panel reverses the energy flow
Make sure the flow of energy is going to the other room
Crystal room Enter and see that the flow of energy passes through a crystal and is diverted to the wall
There is a giant machinery part that blocks a staircase
Crystal puzzle The object of the puzzle is to align the crystals so that the flow of the energy moves the machinery part that blocks the staircase to a position that will make the touch sensitive panels in the alcoves accessible
Panel on the right With the energy flow going to the crystals from the device next room turn the first crystal so that flow goes to the left crystal
Turn left crystal so that the flow of energy goes to the crystal below it
Turn this crystal so that energy goes to the crystal on the right
Turn this crystal so that the energy goes to the crystal on top of the room
Turn this crystal so that the energy goes to the giant machinery part that is on its left
The machinery part is pushed by the energy flow to far wall making the panel by staircase accessible
Panel on the left Turn crystal that is located at middle of the room so that the energy goes to the crystal at left alcove
Turn this crystal so that the energy goes to the crystal left of it
Turn the left crystal in the alcove so that the energy goes to the crystal below it
Turn this crystal so that the energy goes to the machinery part that was pushed to the wall and is now blocking the other panel
Go next door and press the control panel on the side of the first part of the joined mechanical device
This will reverse the flow of energy that is coming out of it
The flow should be coming into the device not going out
Go back to crystal room and see that reversed energy flow pulls the machinery part away from the alcove with the other panel
Both panels are now accessible
Climb the stairs and a panel will open where Nico was waiting
George will call Nico to go back with him down to the crystal room
Look at one of the panel and in inventory call Nico to control one of the panels

Pick the metal plate and feel it hot
Insert metal plate on recess again and operate again so that George will hold it in place but it burns George's hand
One more try Insert metal plate on recess again immediately use the ancient scarf on metal plate to hold it and the door stays open
Since you cannot continue to hold the metal plate and go on with the game let Nico hold the metal plate
Enter the next room

BROKEN SWORD The Sleeping DragonWalkthrough for Action Parts Only January Preface PLEASE only use the following if you get REALLY stuck on one of the 'action' sequences
Beforehand try very many times by yourself it's more satisfying
Note The following is the way I beat these action puzzles eventually
You might very well have different and better methods than these
On the whole BS is an excellent Quest Adventure game
But it is spoiled for some players who find it very difficult in a few cases even impossible to overcome certain of its rapid action episodes
This is an attempt to rectify or at least minimize that situation
The main reasons for the trouble seem to be a combination of keyboard strokes and rapid manipulations plus the complete absence of mouse usage that many players are accustomed to
The keystrokes in BS are rather 'unconventional' and for some folks awkward
In addition the player must act with great rapidity and without any false moves or hesitations
The slightest slip up on the part of the player generally results in a replay of thewholesequence and often a preliminary cutscene as well sometimes as many as dozens of times
In such cases extreme frustration can even lead to abandonment of the game
Only those actualactionepisodes involving speed plus dexterity are dealt with in this walkthrough
But slipping past guards and enemies without being killed sometimes also needs repetitive rapid movements and so the most difficult one of those puzzles is also included here
There are other 'physical' problems puzzles in BS e g
climbing jumping block moving swinging shimmying etc
But these can be completed successfully while taking as much time as the player likes or needs
In the first few weeks since the game has been released there have been a very large number of calls for saved games both on Forums and from kindly individual helpers
But in my opinion a saved game should only be used as a very last resort for many reasons
Someone else's saved game may have covered different territory in a different order than you did and or have acquired different inventory items
In other words that person may have done things that you don't know about or not done things that you have already done
In this particular game every saved game has a sort of 'game played time stamp' affixed and so someone else's game time will be different from yours possiblyverydifferent
But more importantly in one instance see 'Petra in the Congo' below using a saved game inevitably wipes out nearly minutes of cutscenes which considerably advance the story in locations
So the following is my attempt to give assistance in the form of precise albeit factual and doubtless boring instructions which I hope will enable many players to overcome the most difficult rapid action episodes
Note that there are several more action sequences in the game that can get you killed
Only the toughest ones are included below
Some Tips and General Instructions I will dispense with the word 'key' from now on
The ones that you use are the direction arrow keys UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT and the letter keys W A S D In addition to these the one used most of the time but not always is the left only SHIFT which changes walking into running
Important Note The above assumes that the default keys are used
These can be altered in Options
If you have altered them please substitute accordingly for the aforementioned keys
Although the keystrokes recommended are optimal they may have to be adjusted according to individual circumstances and directions tweaked on occasion
Most of the action sequences are in a few parts with time to 'catch your breath' in between each part
This helps a great deal in giving as much time as required to reorganize before a final and generally more difficult part
In every case the maximum speed must be obtained with no hesitations or errors
Also bumping into walls or objects should be avoided since these almost always lead to failure
If you have difficulty I recommend going through a few trial runs before attempting the full operation
And be prepared for several or possibly many attempts
And if you still can't manage to do it the following 'Cheat' may help
In all but the first episode the SHIFT key has to remain depressed continuously throughout
If you like you can keep the SHIFT key pressed down with a moderately heavy object or tape it down temporarily
This will allow you to use all of your fingers ofboth handsfor the other movements which should give more ease and flexibility
The following instructions are arranged in chronological order according to the game DEFEATING PETRA IN VERNON'S APARTMENT In Paris near the beginning of the game This episode is in parts and is not too difficult
Part As Nico walks into Vernon's kitchen for the first time she is accosted by the as yet unknown Petra
Keep a finger poised over S You have quite a bit of time to get organized
Petra is about to shoot Nico who talks playing for time
When Petra starts to say quot You won't be so clever when I've killed you quot keep a sharp eye on the end of the handle of the frying pan As soon asthe handle displays a glittering star highlight press S Part The bullet is deflected by the frying pan
They both move towards the fridge
When Nico starts to say quot I never forget a face quot keep a sharp eye on the handle of the fridge door
Nico continues with quot So why had I forgotten hers quot Exactly as she finishes this sentence a glittering star highlight appears on the fridge door handle
IMMEDIATELY press S Petra will try again but her gun misfires
She runs out of the kitchen and escapes
If you fail you will automatically start Part again from the beginning
DEFEATING PETRA IN PARIS Susarro and Petra ascending in the elevator I personally found this one of the most difficult action puzzles in the game since it involves actually manipulating fingers quickly in accordance with progress
This episode is in parts
Actually the first parts are quite easy only the very last part is very tricky
Unfortunately you can't save it just before then so if when you fail you have to repeatall parts plus a preliminary cutscene
Part You have a LOT of time to get organized
During this period POSITION your fingers onto the appropriate keys but DEPRESS NONE of themyet
Let one left hand finger rest on SHIFT and another left hand finger rest on A let one right hand finger rest on DOWN
Wait until George FINISHES the sentence quot Nico we won't have enough time to get past the elevator
Find somewhere to hide quot
Continue to wait a few seconds after this
When the empty circles of the action map suddenly appear IMMEDIATELY pressonly and simultaneously and keep them depressed a very short time ONLY until George runs the very short distance to the edge of the chasm
Then VERY QUICKLY release them both andIMMEDIATELYpress onlyuntil George is hanging safely from the edge of the void
Part You now have as much time as you like
Press LEFT continuously so that George swings along to the left until he arrives as close as possible to Nico
Part Get ready for themost difficultpart
Make one single click on W George jumps up and alerts the villains
You now have only a relatively short time to get ready for the final and hardest part
Part QuicklyPOSITION fingers onto the appropriate keys but DEPRESS NONE of themyet Let one left hand finger rest on SHIFT and another left hand finger rest on S let one right hand finger rest on UP and another right hand finger rest on LEFT
Wait until Petra's gun misfires and Nico starts running to the left IMMEDIATELY when Nico STARTS to say quot Quick George
This way quot press all of the keys simultaneously and keep them all depressed continuously
BUT and here's the common problem Every time that George gets close to the corridor wall on the right side of the screen release your finger from ONLY for a second or two and then return that finger until he's close to the middle of the corridor and no more
They should run and reach the elevator successfully
You can then release all keys
If you fail you will automatically start Part again from before the beginning
DEFEATING PETRA IN THE CONGO In the Omega Temple after acquiring the alpha stone This episode is in parts
Note Please see the Preface above about why using someone else's saved game for this puzzle is particularly inadvisable
Part You have a LOT of time to get organized but on your original attempt only
During this period POSITION fingers onto the appropriate keys but DEPRESS NONE of themyet Let a left hand finger rest on SHIFT let one right hand finger rest on DOWN and another right hand finger rest on LEFT
IMMEDIATELY after the earthquake scene and Nico FINISHES but not before the sentence quot Come on George
Let's get out of here quot press all keys simultaneously and keep them all depressed continuously
If you don't do this correctly George gets shot and you return back to the earthquake scene
If however you DO perform it correctly George and Nico reach a ledge and canyon safely but exhausted
Part There are or fairly short cutscenes non interactive giving you a bit of time to organize the second part that finish with a close up of Nico's face
During this period POSITION your fingers onto the appropriate keys but DEPRESS NONE of themyet
Let one left hand finger rest on SHIFT and another left hand finger on S let one right hand finger rest on UP and another right hand finger rest on LEFT
IMMEDIATELY when Nico STARTS to say quot Come on George we have to move fast quot press all keys simultaneously and keep them all depressed continuously
George and Nico should run and jump the gap successfully and you can then release all keys
If you fail you will automatically start Part again from the earthquake scene
ESCAPING THE GUARD IN THE CATACOMBS Using the microwave This episode is in parts
This is quite likely the most difficult action puzzle in the game since it involves quick changes in finger manipulations and several different types of actions
Please have patience and be prepared to repeat it several times
Prerequisites A You must have viewed the guard sitting at the kitchen table or you can't even START this puzzle
B You must have obtained the old iron key from the corpse behind the door in the sitting room or horror of horrors you can get through to the very last and easiest stage but then cannot possibly finish it
Part Every time you restart the puzzle you find yourself outside in the corridor and the old key is NOT highlighted in your inventory
So before proceeding further highlight the old key in your inventory
Then enter the sitting room and stand near the microwave so that a glittering star highlight appears on it
Part When you are ready POSITION fingers onto the appropriate keys but DEPRESS NONE of themyet Let one left hand finger rest on SHIFT and another left hand finger on S let one right hand finger rest on UP another right hand finger rest on LEFT and a third right hand finger rest on RIGHT
Press Shift and then press S to activate the puzzle
After activating the puzzle you can remove your finger completely from S but you must continue pressing SHIFT until the end of the whole episode if you have difficulty doing this see the 'Cheat' above listed under 'Some Tips and General Information'
George turns around and says sentences quot The microwave suddenly sprang into life quot and quot It was going to make a noise
I had to hide fast quot
JUST after he starts the SECOND sentence start moving as follows Make a quick and very short press on LEFT only and George turns clockwise and walks or steps to the left of the screen
Then press UP only and keep it down and with a LOT of luck he'll run forward and through the door without hitting anything
Most likely however you'll see that he's going to miss the door
If so then quickly adjust his run by ADDING a very brieftouchon RIGHT or less likely on LEFT while all the time keeping a left hand finger on SHIFT and a right hand finger on UP
When you're out of the door hopefully without mishap you may be lucky and by simply continuing to keep a left hand finger on SHIFT and a right hand finger on UP you enter the door of the empty room opposite the sitting room
More than likely however you'll have to adjust his run by ADDING a very brieftouchon LEFT or possibly on RIGHT
You can now breathe easier the toughest and quickest part of the episode has been completed
Part George hides by the wall alongside the door
You will see a cutscene of the guard leaving the kitchen walking the corridor and entering the sitting room machine gun at the ready
You have to be fairly quick from now on but not desperately so
When control returns to George quickly press SHIFT and first RIGHT and then UP until he reaches the microwave sitting room door and a glittering star highlight appears on its keyhole doNOToverstep it
Press S to quietly close this door with George on the outside and the guard on the inside
Press your spacebar to activate your inventory
Press S to use the old key on the keyhole and lock up the guard in the microwave room
quot Yes mission accomplished quot SLIPPING PAST THE GUARD IN THE CATHEDRAL Times This episode is in completely self contained parts
The guard you have to evade is the one without the dog near the altar
You have to evade him separate times going in opposite directions
You can save and relax ONLY after you have COMPLETED each one of the three
After doing what you need to do in the office the second time is from left to right in order to get to the pulpit near the right edge of the screen and read the Bible
You can save if you continue on to the robe room
The third time is from right to left again to get back to the door on the left side in order to enter the office and finish there
Once again save in the office
NOTES While you are in the midst of performing each of the maneuvers described above you are only safe when you are But because you are safe in all of those places each trip across the room can be split into separate sections with time to rest between each section
As far as the VERY clumsy controls allow hug the back wall and try to keep in the shadows as much as possible although this recommendation may not help much
Always try to move ONLY when the guard has his back turned toward George
You have to move pretty quickly to complete each section of movement without getting shot and killed
And you generally can't hide on the way apart from the aforementioned sheltered locations
In this episode perhaps more than the others the keystrokes recommended may have to be adjusted to suit your specific actions and the positions of George and the guard
It rsquo s very easy to veer off course in which case you rsquo ll have to make some adjustments
Part to get to the office Section Wait until the guard starts to walk down the steps
IMMEDIATELY press one finger on LEFT until you rsquo re alongside the entrance to the pulpit
Quickly press LEFT and DOWN simultaneously to enter the pulpit
Read the Bible there etc where George is safe
Section Get George to stand just INSIDE the entrance to the pulpit facing the right side of the screen if he moves even a little outside he may get killed
Let a left hand finger rest on SHIFT let one right hand finger rest on DOWN and another right hand finger rest on RIGHT
Wait until the guard starts to move towards his left then IMMEDIATELY press and to exit the pulpit
Quickly press all three keys and guide George using together with and alternately if necessary
Once he is behind and close to the partition he rsquo s safe
Section Get George to move behind the partition near the right side of the screen but for safety not TOO near the edge
Let a left hand finger rest on SHIFT let one right hand finger rest on UP and another right hand finger rest on RIGHT
Wait until the guard starts to walk down the steps
IMMEDIATELY press all three keys and guide George using together with and alternately if necessary
Once he rsquo s in the area of the door he rsquo s safe
He can then enter the office door with no further danger and do whatever is necessary inside
Save here
Part to get to the pulpit Section Press one finger on RIGHT until you rsquo ve reached the right pillar of the archway don rsquo t exceed this or you rsquo ll get shot
Wait until the guard starts to walk down the steps then IMMEDIATELY press a left hand finger on SHIFT and a right hand finger on RIGHT
George will rapidly draw level with the partition
When he is JUST beyond this change your right hand finger from RIGHT to LEFT while keeping your left hand finger on SHIFT
Once George is behind and close to the partition he is completely safe
Section Get George to move behind the partition near the left side of the screen but for safety not TOO near the edge
Let a left hand finger rest on SHIFT let one right hand finger rest on UP and another right hand finger rest on LEFT
Wait until the guard starts to walk to his left
IMMEDIATELY press all three keys until George reaches the side wall
Then press UP only for a very short time until he reaches the entrance to the pulpit
Using DOWN and LEFT either simultaneously or alternately whichever works best get George to enter the pulpit
Read the Bible there etc where George is safe
Section optional but advisable
Press SHIFT RIGHT
SHIFT UP to continue to the robe room
You can save here
Part to get back to the office again If you start from the robe room then this part is the exactly the same as Part
If you start from the pulpit then that eliminates the first section
Once again save after you enter the office
END GAME GENERAL NOTES ONLY No saved game can be supplied after this episode because it is followed immediately by the closing cutscenes credits and the end of the game
But compared to some of the other action puzzles in the game this episode is relatively easy
Plus the developers say that it gets even easier if the player fails a few times
Note the path running up and down near the middle of the screen
There is an upside down V shaped wall to the left of this path and a more complex but similar one to the right of the path nearer to George
George himself is downscreen from both of these walls and on the left side of the path
Behind either of these walls George is safe

Solution Arrange the top circle with blue on top and red at bottom
The bottom circle should be arranged to have the blue on the left and the red at the bottom

The next logical color will be blue background
The top right quadrants of the manuscript shields in order left to right Showed gold lions in blue background then blue from previous background lions in white background and then white from previous background lions in red background

Byzantine The BetrayalWalkthroughbyDan KennedyJuly Introduction Byzantine The Betrayal from Discovery Channel Multimedia is an effective and entertaining whodunit adventure game set in Istanbul Turkey As an investigative reporter you must find the persons responsible for smuggling valuable and historically significant Turkish antiquities out of the country and for the murder of your school chum Emre
Like the Tex Murphy games Byzantinedoes an admirable job at combining a number of gameplay styles and environments into a compelling experience FMV sections featuring a mostly Turkish cast are interspersed with photographic based first person exploration and a virtual reality simulator Each gaming style is effectively integrated into the story and help to vary the gameplay
Given the source the game is expectedly rich with historical and cultural information about Turkey and its people and takes you on a comprehensive tour of Istanbul as it stands today Drawbacks include the somewhat raw FMV scenes and the uneven pacing of the game which careens between patient exploration of a historical environment and ldquo do this in seconds or die rdquo type encounters All in all it rsquo s a valiant effort from a company without a great deal of experience producing adventure games regrettably the Discovery Channel didn rsquo t produce any similar games after Byzantine
Call of the Wild The intro movie begins with an e mail message from your old friend Emre Bahis imploring you to come to Istanbul immediately Apparently he rsquo s got a story that will virtually guarantee you an investigative reporter a Pulitzer Prize The remainder of the movie shows your arriving in Turkey interspersed with shots of Emre madly trying to escape his apartment before the police arrive to arrest him although he does have time to neatly fold his Levi rsquo s up over his Doc Martin laces
The game begins as a police detective Akalin intercepts you as you arrive atEmre rsquo s apartment Select any of the conversation paths ndash either way the detective lets you know what a shady character Emre is and bristles at your multiple cancelled visas He ends by suggesting you stay in Emre rsquo s apartment ndash a capital idea since there is much to examine before you set off on your investigation Begin by examining the three items in your inventory shown at the bottom of the screen your passport visa press pass and a bunch of items sent to you by Emre prior to your arrival Examine the items by clicking on them to pick them up and then clicking on the magnifying glass on the left edge of the inventory bar While examining books and papers look for a ldquo medallion rdquo icon over on the right side of the object ndash this allows you to flip papers pages
The items sent by Emre include a letter a postcard showing three landmarks of Istanbul Topkapi Palace the Suleymaniye Mosque and Sultanahment Park and a newspaper article The materials suggest that the ldquo Diadem of Constantinople rdquo has been stolen from an archaeological site smuggled out of Turkey and sold on the black market to an American collector Emre believes he knows how this smuggling operation is carrying out the thievery and thinks that someone named KLIO is the key When finished with the documents find the downward pointing icon in the bottom right corner of the screen and click to return to the apartment view
Apartment Hunting Byzantine allows for degree panning you can also look up or down as you do so and a magnifying glass icon indicates when a particular spot or item can be viewed in close up In addition the icon turns light yellow when another inventory item can be applied to a particular hotspot Starting in the kitchen dining room the following items can be examined A photograph of Emre and the stereo both located on a dresser to the right of the windows The view out both windows as well a stained glass man can be examined on the left window A drawing on the table to the left of the windows that shows the following x grid A wooden box to the left of the drawing that holds a sketch of a roman bust
Enter the living room ndash if you rsquo ve been wondering what that background ringing sound was its Emre rsquo s telephone Turn towards his desk and click on it to step behind Click on the telephone once for a close up and again on the receiver to answer it if the phone isn rsquo t ringing while you are looking at it continue examining items and return to it once it starts ringing again Emre is on the line ndash he implores us to leave and mentions the name KLIO again Just ignore him and keep examining the apartment
Pick up the Polaroid camera located at the left end of the desk note the unplugged power cord on the desk and then click on the portfolio in the centre Grab the photo of Emre with an unknown lady KLIO
and then turn over the next photo to reveal a third one with coloured shapes on it note the order of the colours red green purple yellow orange dark blue light blue Back away from the portfolio and then from the desk view as well
Facing the desk again click on the wooden trunk located in front of the desk Inside click on the wooden box ndash the close up view shows the same seven coloured symbols from the photo as buttons on the top of the box Click the seven buttons in the order shown in the photograph The box opens to reveal a drawing of some sort of optical scanning device Back away and return to the room view
Looking For Clues There are a number of items you need to look at that are scattered about Emre rsquo s living room At some point Emre will call back and beg you to leave immediately for your own safety but take your time to look at all of the clues and documentation found in the apartment
Facing the bookcases behind and to the right of the desk Find the hotspot above the desk to the left of a lute hanging on the bookcase Find the book titled ldquo The Art of The Carpet rdquo on the shelf and click on it to reveal a key hanging behind the book Take the key and back away
Click on the shelf located below the lute for another close up Click on the black book located immediately to the right of the thick red one ndash the book contains background information and photographs of Topkapi Palace It rsquo s an interesting if not essential read but at the very least take a look at the pictures since you rsquo ll be visiting the palace during the game
On the same shelf find the Roman Engineering book and click on it ndash there doesn rsquo t appear to be much more that a diagram of a roman hoist The only thing to do here is to remember where you saw this picture ndash so you can return to it when needed
Back away again and then click on the bookshelf to the right of the lute Click on the book titled ldquo The Secret History rdquo to read the words of an author with an obvious hatred for the Emperor Justinian and his wife Again this isn rsquo t essential reading but it does help to fill in some details about historical figures you will encounter during the game
On the same shelf click on the ldquo Turkish Teasers rdquo and grab the note hidden inside the book ndash it contains a rhyme about two girls sleeping Answers to the two visible riddles in the book can be read by clicking on the paper tabs at the bottom of each page
Across the room click on the picture on Emre rsquo s desk to see a shot of him with an older heavy set man Now click on the second drawer from the bottom to open it up Click on the pictures inside the open drawer to see a few sights of Istanbul Click on the curtain hanging on the wall to the right of the dresser to get a close up and again in the lower left corner to reveal a ldquo secret rdquo back door to Emre rsquo s apartment Click on the doorknob to go out into the back hallway and spin around until you are facing the downward stairs
Click twice to descend the stairs and emerge by Emre rsquo s front door This back exit may come in handy in a pinch
Re enter Emre rsquo s apartment building again and you find yourself back in Emre rsquo s kitchen Now turn around exit the door to the left of the table and find yourself in the courtyard again
This time find and click the ldquo map rdquo icon on the passageway leading to the street located to the left of the apartment doorway
Emre rsquo s Embers The screen switches to a map of Istanbul with locations that are available to be visited marked on the map Besides Emre rsquo s apartment we can visit the three city landmarks shown on Emre rsquo s postcard Topkapi Palace Suleymaniye Mosque andSultanahment Park Let rsquo s start withTopkapiPalacesince we rsquo ve already had the chance to leaf through a book about the landmark back in the apartment Click on the Palace rsquo s label to proceed there
We get a short introduction movie and find ourselves in front of the palace A woman standing by the front door appears to be waiting for someone Note that the cursor turns lighter when over the woman ndash this means we will have to show her something from our inventory in order to engage her in conversation Since this may be the woman in the photograph we obtained from Emre rsquo s briefcase grab it from your inventory and click on the woman note the photo glows when over the woman indicating this is the right choice
We learn that her name is Nuray and she has been working with Emre as a research assistant in fact she was supposed to meet him here Choose conversation paths Why do you think hellip
Where do you think he is
and Why was he meeting you here
to learn the most information including the fact that Emre rsquo s uncle Mehmet owns a carpet store in the market
After Nuray leaves the scene click to the right of the main doors of the palace and read the poster here It seems that the palace is closed to the public due to the discovery of a new tunnel below the floor Back away and try the doors ndash locked tight Find the map icon on the right side of the screen and leave the palace location
You can try visitingSultanahment Park but there really isn rsquo t anything there to see other than a few buildings in the distance Turn towards the fountain access the map again and go toMemhet rsquo s rug shop
All in the Family After the intro movie plays we see the heavyset man from one of Emre rsquo s photographs arguing with an Italian looking man The man rushes off and Mehmet invites us into his shop Enter through the doorway and look around in the entrance way There is a bunch of papers and other items located just to the left but nothing can be taken in the close up view you thief
Try picking up the rolled up rug on the stairs just to the left of the papers ndash a voice tells us that the rug is not for sale Enter the main part of the shop by heading to the right of the papers and other items
Mehmet provides commentary for several of the items in the shop the comments are activated by clicking on that item The red green carpet located straight ahead Another carpet located to the right of the red green one lying flat on a surface ndash it rsquo s his brother rsquo s carpet and is not for sale A set of antiques located to the left of the red green carpet particularly the jewellery on the left and the axe on the far right and A small picture of Ataturk hanging on the wall above the antiques

Choose conversation path I am looking for a package hellip Have you seen him
Do you recognize this woman in the photo
and No Emre has been here very recently which is a great sign
Attempt to enter the palace ndash the old man will stop you and make you take your shoes off Now you can enter the mosque
Inside the mosque pan to your left until you see a large wood box like item in front of you This structure can be viewed in close up but nothing can be manipulated Back away from the box pan to the right and move towards the far wall with the two green lights on it At your new position you can click for a close up of some wood furniture to the right of the large windows in the corner The small table on the right has a book discussing the history and architecture of the mosque A small door to the left of the table can also be viewed but not entered

Have a close up look at Emre rsquo s shoes ndash there is a claim check hidden inside the right shoe directing us to theHotel De Londres Return to the map view by exiting the mosque area and go to theHotel its position is close to Emre rsquo s apartment
Mixed Bag We find ourselves in a lounge type room inside the hotel Move towards the back of the room and turn to your right to face several radios on a bureau One of the radios can be viewed in close up but pushing the button on the front doesn rsquo t do much Back away and pan to the right to face the coffee table ndash click on the trunk behind it to see some Turkish folk art there rsquo s nothing in the trunk though Continue panning to the right click on the bar and again on the bar rsquo s surface to see some Turkish currency Back away turn around and return to the front of the room
Spin around until you spot the desk clerk click on him and give him the claim check He returns with a battered knapsack Examine the knapsack ndash it contains a betting form fromthe Nargile Bar with Mehmet rsquo s name written on it a strange looking piece of equipment and a pass to enter the Basilica Cistern This last item must indicate where Emre wanted us to meet him
Examine the machine again and try pressing the ldquo Power rdquo button It looks like the equipment needs to be recharged Didn rsquo t Emre have an unplugged power cord on his desk We rsquo d better return to his apartment to recharge the equipment Back away from the clerk exit the hotel to his right and return toEmre rsquo s apartment
Assault and Battery Enter Emre rsquo s apartment and go into the living room This is a good time to save your game as we have a timed sequence coming up Click on Emre rsquo s desk and then while holding the equipment click on the end of the power cord The machine quickly powers up but you hear a bump and a thump in the background ndash someone is entering Emre rsquo s apartment building Once the machine has completely recharged back away from it and then again from the desk surface Quickly click on the curtain covering the secret back door uncover the doorknob and click there to go out into the hallway
You have about seconds to complete this sequence of moves starting with clicking on the power cord ndash it rsquo s actually plenty of time to get out If you mess it up Carlo the villain comes into the living room and kills you with a dramatic flourish straight out of a twenties silent movie Once in the hall you will automatically turn around and peer back into the doorway ndash the same man Carlo who was earlier arguing with Mehmet outside his shop is yelling at another man and then they both leave
Take this opportunity to examine the piece of equipment again It now will turn on but asks for a password to continue You can try a few words and phrases but they probably won rsquo t work Turn it off and put it away for later

Bringing Up the Dead You are immediately questioned by our friendly neighbourhood police detective Akalin In order to learn as much as you can about the case and not anger the detective choose the following conversation path I saw who did it I saw him at Mehmet rsquo s hellip What is going on
and Someone just killed my friend After the detective is done with you head over toMehmet rsquo s rug shopto try to learn more about why Emre was killed
Enter Mehmet rsquo s shop and walk into the back room ndash Mehmet automatically engages you in a conversation about his brother rsquo s death You can use the following conversation path although any will do Afacan
Emre was asking questions hellip I think I know who hellip and It was the man hellip Mehmet eventually stops you mentions that he and you have much to discuss but asks you to leave so he can close the shop and go home be with his family He also gives you a photograph of him and Emre either during the conversation or afterwards as you leave Comply with his wishes and leave the shop
From the map view select a neutral location such asEmre rsquo s apartment or my personal favourite ndash Sultanahment Park and examine the photograph Mehmet gave to you Flip the photograph over by clicking on the top right corner ndash again the word Afacan shows up here Could this be the password to the electronic device Examine the device and input ldquo AFACAN rdquo into the password prompt
We rsquo re in We see some sort of virtual building layout and then seem to access a system at Istanbul University only to have our access quickly terminated Return to the map view and make your way toIstanbul University
Virtually Topkapi After the intro movie you find yourself outside the glass doors of a small computer lab Proceed through the door and click on the girl seated at the computer to speak with her She is quite dismissive of you since she has her own nerdy problems to deal with Show her the electronic device ndash she rsquo ll be very interested to talk to you then
The girl rsquo s name is Sharife and she has designed a computer database that assembles historical facts and pictures into virtual reality simulations of historical sites Someone has been tampering with her program and files and she thinks that the scanner in your possession was used to do this For the conversation you can choose the following path although any path will do here Belonged to Emre Bahis What did you find on the hard drive
Are you KLIO
Why were the police hellip Journalist OK tell me hellip Emre told me to find hellip and What exactly is KLIO
To demonstrate the success of her KLIO conceptual database she asks you to don the VR viewer and visit the thcentury simulation of Topkapi Palace Take the visor and away you go
The Throne Room simulation allows you to pan degrees similarly to the real life game locations and the inventory bar functions the same way except that items do not get taken into the real world but there are a few differences here For one the cursor is different ndash the four point arrow will pulse when movement in a particular direction can be achieved A magnifying glass indicates a close up is possible and a blocky diamond signals an auditory message can be triggered You can exit the simulation by pressing the ldquo System Exit rdquo button Additional ldquo detail rdquo information scrolls up the screen when items are moused over this can be shut off using the details button It can also be difficult to locate the ldquo back away rdquo cursor on the close up views ndash try placing the cursor in the bottom right had corner of the view screen to get it to pulsate
The following items can be examined in this room Note the doorway that looks as if the computer is missing some simulation pieces The informational text lists these areas as ldquo Data deleted ndash needs replacement rdquo A burlwood trunk located to the right of the missing doorway can be viewed
Inscriptions carved above two doorways can be heard by clicking on them
A small table with a ceremonial jug on its surface to the right of the trunk can be examined
The throne area see below for more details
Throne for a Loop Facing the throne click above the bench to hear a passage about the death of the brothers of Mohammed the rd After click on the seat of the bench to pick up the letter located here Examine it closely it rsquo s a note to Suleyman from Ibrahim a trusted servant explaining the rules of a game he has sent Back away and click on the game located in front of the bench
You must place the remaining stones on the game board so that lines of stones are formed Remember the drawing we copied down in Emre rsquo s apartment ndash it is useful here Use the diagram below to recreate the triangle in our original sketch on the game grid and then create a second triangle with the remaining pieces Your final shape should look like the one below and you should only need the pieces to complete it The shape will glow yellow when you have the right match
Back away from the table and click on the bench again ndash now there rsquo s a strange gold cylinder and another letter on the throne The letter is from Suleyman back to Ibrahim thanking him for the game and telling him to give the cylinder to his wife Hurrem when he returns Place the cylinder into your inventory and back away
Another part of the room can be accessed by moving to the left of the throne The following items can be examined in this portion of the room A passage is read aloud as soon as we make the move
An ivory bookstand is located on the table to the right of your initial position ndash on it find a picture book with four drawings Clicking on each drawing triggers a passage explaining something about the life loves and family of Suleyman
The pillow and brazier located across from the bookstand can also be viewed
We can rsquo t go any farther here since the doorway into the rest of the palace is missing from the simulation Hit the ldquo System Exit rdquo button to exit KLIO rsquo s Topkapi simulation
You immediately launch into another conversation with Sharife regarding the simulation Choose the following conversation path to agree to collect the missing data using Emre rsquo s scanner More simulations Section missing Anywhere else Scan
and I rsquo ll take scans Since the Topkapi palace is closed Sharife mentions that we need to find items from the thcentury Ottoman Empire during Suleyman rsquo s reign Exit the computer lab and return to the map view
Scanning the Museum Take Sharife rsquo s advice and begin your search at theArchaeological Museum Upon arrival you have a choice of three directions to explore ndash a small door to the left some statues straight ahead and the main museum to the right Begin by panning to the left and finding the open doorway and click to get a close up Note the ldquo headphone rdquo cursor on the right side of the screen ndash click it to hear a portion of the cassette tour of the museum presenting historical and cultural information for selected items In this case the voice indicates that Ottoman Empire aged tiles may be present in the left building
Click on the doorway to enter and again to access the interior displays of tiles and ceramic dishes Once inside pan to the right and find a semi circular section of tile mounted on the wall Click to get a close up ndash the voice over mentions both Suleyman and Topkapi Click below the headphones icon to get an even closer view and take out your scanner ndash unfortunately the scanner fails to light up indicating that you can rsquo t upload this particular item
Fortunately once you back away from the piece and turn around there rsquo s a similar tile hanging on the wall on the other side of the room Click to examine the tile listen to the tour voiceover and then pull out your scanner and press ldquo ON rdquo to upload the tile image Back away and return outside
There are several sculptures to examine that are located between the two buildings ndash find the magnifying glass icon and click to move closer There are three sculptures to examine ndash the column to the left the human statue in the centre and a crypt to the right of the statue Only the crypt can be scanned and when this is attempted the scanner tells us the item is from the wrong historical period Back away from the sculptures and enter the main portion of the museum to the right
There are two items to view in the lobby and three available directions to proceed in left right and up the stairs Both items a display case and a bust are located to the left of the staircase Both items a display case holding a copy of the Turkish Act of Antiquity in the upper right corner and a bust of the museum rsquo s founder can be examined but are unimportant to the story You can proceed up the stairs but a locked door awaits you at the top we will have to come back later
Back in the lobby choose the left passageway ndash there are several items to see in the room ahead but nothing to scan here including a bell a sculpted torso of Artemis an altar and several tombstones hanging on the wall The tour voiceover supplies some great historical and cultural information After viewing the objects return to the museum lobby and proceed down the right passageway to the Alexandrian Hall containing sculptures related to Alexander the Great There are a number of busts and pictures of Alexander the Great and several Greek statues including a hermaphrodite and a satyr around the room Again nothing here can be scanned Exit this room return to the lobby leave the museum and return to the map view Saving Suleyman Any ideas as to where we could find further Topkapi aged items to scan How about theSuleymaniyeMosque which is named after Suleyman himself Head back to the mosque location and enter the building directly don rsquo t worry about your shoes this time Once inside you will immediately spot the young guy who was outside the doors during your first visit Engage him in conversation to learn a little more about Emre and Mehmet using the following recommended but not required conversation path Emre rsquo s dead What do you mean
Have you spoken hellip Did you think hellip Who would hellip and Emre and Mehmet together
Once he leaves turn towards the wooden box to the left and click on it for a close up The light colour of the icon indicates that we can probably scan this item ndash take out your scanner and upload the image Once completed back away pan to the right and move towards the wall with the two hanging green lights Click to the right of the windows to get a close up of the corner and click again on the oblique view of the wooden doorway on the left Take out your scanner and click on the bottom panel of the door to upload this image That rsquo s a little more like it
Back away return to the spot near the big wood box and make your way back out of the mosque through the open doorway Return to the map view and selectIstanbul Universityas your next destination
Enter the computer lab again and hand the scanner to Sharife who will transfer the images into KLIO Now find the VR helmet located to the left of Sharife and click on it twice to re enter theTopkapi simulation The three images that you have successfully scanned are in your inventory along with the items that you collected during your last visit
Face the missing doorway select each of the three pieces in turn and click on both the doorway and the piece over the doorway to determine whether any of the scans is a successful match One of the wood panels from the mosque the one without the knob is used by the computer to recreate the doorway however neither of the other two pieces can be used for the tile above the door We rsquo ll need to find another location to recreate that tile piece Exit the simulation and return to the map view
Under the Rug One thing rsquo s for certain Mehmet is deeply involved with this mystery Since he mentioned that he wants to discuss things further it rsquo s a great time to return to his shop to do so Unfortunately the shop is closed and locked when we arrive Don rsquo t we have a key in our inventory ndash one that was hidden in Emre rsquo s bookshelf Use the key to open Mehmet rsquo s shop and step inside
Now is your chance to check out that stack of papers and bric a brac by the door Pan to your left a bit and look down Hunting with your cursor indicates that a pair of scissors and a pencil can both be taken from this spot Back away turn to your left a bit more and click on the carpet that Mehmet told us earlier was ldquo not for sale rdquo Click on it to move it aside revealing a blue duffel bag underneath Take the bag and examine it ndash there are several useful items inside and each needs to be examined once they are out of the bag
First out is a odd looking ring with a bug on it Next is a note from Emre to Mehmet indicating that there is something the ldquo key rdquo to Artemis hidden on the rug that Mehmet indicated was Emre rsquo s located in the other room Next we find a pamphlet for the Istanbul Archaeological Museum and a book describing the Aya Sofya ndash an ancient Istanbul church Lastly a red notebook at the bottom of the bag looks empty ndash except that there appears to be something imprinted into the first page of the book Take out your pencil and click on the page to reveal the writing ldquo Nargile ndash Fri Eggplant Tuesday Oranges rdquo Proceed into the backroom of Mehmet rsquo s shop and turn to the right to face Emre rsquo s rug it rsquo s the one lying on top of some sort of table Click near the bottom right corner to turn up the rug and expose the label Get out your scissors and cut the tag off by clicking on it Inside you rsquo ll find a disk with a sun emblem on it Place it in your inventory and make your way out of Mehmet rsquo s shop At the map view note that we have a new location to check out ndash Aya Sofya The Nargile Bar can also be visited but since we know that Mehmet rsquo s troubles with gambling started there it may be wise to stay away until we know more about it Proceed toAya Sofya
Aya Adore You begin your visit in the entrance hall ndash listen to the voiceover available by clicking on the headphone icon on the left door and then proceed straight ahead into the main portion of the church we rsquo ll explore these other areas a little later Inside the main hall turn around and check out the following items A water container located to the right of the door you just entered A large jug used in the Muslim washing ritual located to the right of the water container Move forward to the right of the water jug and examine the pillar with the small hole in it The voiceover tells of the sacking of the church by crusaders in and of the pillar of St Gregory which is said to grant wishes to people with sweaty fingers The doors to the left of the pillar both lead back out to the entrance hall
Walk back into the main chamber move to the right of the scaffolding and click on the coronation circles on the floor here to learn about their place in the emperor Justinian rsquo s world The pillared structure behind the circles can also be examined more closely There is a gentleman standing to the right of the circles ndash engage him in conversation to learn about his research Hillary Peebles is an ancient history professor researching his latest book Engage him in conversation and use the following conversation path to glean the most information from him Are you familiar hellip Emre had a book hellip You know Emre
What kinds of things hellip Is the Omphalos hellip and Ottoman features hellip After the professor begs off continue off to the right of the scaffolding to the back of the church where you can examine and listen to the voiceovers for the following items A religious niche built by the Ottomans stands directly in front of you
A balcony up and off to the left
An ornate staircase to the right of the niche
Return to the coronation circles and move off to the right of Peebles There are several windows on the left side of the screen ndash the third lets you peek into what Peebles mentioned is the Ottoman library Back up and click on the doorway on the extreme right hand side of the screen Click again on the doorway and enter the library where you immediately encounter Nuray She rsquo s hesitant to talk about Emre but try this combination to get some valuable information on their activities Emre is dead What kind of work hellip What did he do hellip What historical sites hellip and List of sites hellip She runs off to think leaving you alone in the library
Spin around and examine the tile located on the working table here ndash it appears to contain an inscription like those in the Topkapi simulation Take out your scanner and upload the image of the tile Panning to the right find the tile up near the ceiling in the corner that has a hotspot on it ndash click for a close up and use the scanner to upload an image Now examine the bookcase to the right of the table ndash the middle shelf contains a book that outlines the history and intrigue of Suleyman rsquo s court It also introduces some of the personalities that you will encounter including Suleyman Roxelana Mustafa Ibrahim and Gulbahar
Exit the library and make your way back to the front hallway of the church Facing the exterior doorway turn to the left and proceed down the hall here You will quickly encounter another doorway but turn around and look up at the archway you just came through ndash there rsquo s a beautiful painting up on the wall here that can be examined Return to the main doorway again and this time proceed down the hallway to the right of the main outside door
This hallway leads up to a set of connected balconies overlooking the church The first room has a great view of the main church area from the balcony the windows on the right side of the church can also be examined more closely Note the circle on the floor in front of the balcony ndash the voiceover tells us that this is where the empress would be stationed for ceremonies
Access the next room to the right of the balcony There are two items to be viewed to the right of the archway leading into the next room ndash a glass block in the wall used for monitoring earthquakes and a stone crypt in the corner of the room A large painting can be viewed to the left of the doorway that you just entered the room through Turning to the right click between the first and second pillars overlooking the church and click on the headphones in the bottom left corner of the screen to learn about mysterious runes on the wall Backing away click on the wall under the first and second pillars to see an attempt to remove crosses from the carvings here
Move through the archway into the third room a window facing away from the main church room can be viewed nothing
and two pictures located to the right of the balcony view can be examined
Make your way back through the rooms to the main entrance hall and exit the church Proceed back toIstanbul Universityto test out your new scans
The Fountainhead Give your scanner to Sharife and let her insert the scans into KLIO Grab the VR helmet and re enter the simulation Once inside grab the panel with the inscription from your inventory position it over the incomplete part of the doorway and click ndash the simulation takes it and restores the doorway Click on the tile to hear the inscription and then click on the door to enter the next room
The room is dominated by a central fireplace and a royal dais located to the left and right of the flames The left dais contains a sword and a writing desk that can be examined more closely and the right dais has a hand mirror and a lavta a stringed instrument to be viewed you can also strum the lavta to hear its sound Both locations also trigger passages about life during the reign of Suleyman Panning to the left past the doorway to the left of the left dais a shelf contains several other instruments to hear a zurna flute and a bumbelek drum
Panning to the left from the shelf a water fountain is present along the next wall On closer inspection the water flows from a tap in the wall down into a mechanical flower drain A switch to the right of the tap seems to accomplish nothing Back away and click below the fountain to view a series of five elegant decorative tiles
There rsquo s nothing happening here so back up pan to the right and exit the room via the door
Upon entering the Imperial Library click on the red box item on the table located directly in front of you ndash this is some sort of decorative clock Click on the hands of the clock ndash they can be moved by clicking again on the numbers around the clock face Note the gold buttons below ndash the one on the far right appears to be missing ndash grab the gold cylinder from your inventory and click on the empty spot to insert it into the clock
It appears that we must set the time on this clock but without more information we rsquo ll need to move on Back away examine the book binding and pen to the right of the clock and then pan to the left to face the wall here Click between the two wall panels to catch a glimpse of a room beyond the walls Back away pan to the left and click on the ablution fountain in the corner of the room Click once on the master switch for the harem fountain and then click above the switch to hear a passage about the palace

The Fountainhead Approach the harem fountain again and click on the switch beside the tap ndash this cuts off the water flow into the flower Try clicking on the flower now ndash it flexes but nothing happens Back away and click below the fountain to view the tiles again We hear whispers in the background as we look at the five tiles which now bear the images of five prominent figures from Suleyman rsquo s court Roxelana Mustafa Suleyman Ibrahim and Gulbahar
The object here is to have the Suleyman tile facing up by itself Clicking on each of the tiles causes a set of pre determined tiles to flip up or down Along the way if you manage to get one of the other characters to face up by themselves you will hear them recount something about their life in court The exception is Mustafa who I could not get to face upward by himself
Use the following combinations of tile clicks to hear each of the characters speak each combination starts from the initial all tile facing upward position To find the initial position click the centre tile once or twice
To hear Roxelana click Ibrahim Gulbahar Mustafa To hear Mustafa n a To hear Ibrahim click Roxelana Mustafa To hear Gulbahar click Ibrahim Gulbahar Mustafa Roxelana To hear Suleyman click Suleyman Gulbahar Mustafa Mustafa Suleyman describes his love for Roxelana and mentions that ldquo is the sun rdquo an obvious reference to the clock in the next room After Suleyman speaks you are given a cylindrical decorative letter seal Place it into your inventory back away and return to the library

Cisterns are Doing It For Themselves Proceed over toEmre rsquo s apartment ndash Sharife rsquo s been looking for you and finds you on the street outside the building Choose whichever conversation path suits you and agree to attempt to repair the Basilica Cistern simulation Alternatively you can try this conversation path I found Emre rsquo s body hellip Can the missing KLIO hellip
Do you think someone hellip
No one reported hellip The police told me hellip Who else has access hellip
and Let me into hellip Sharife gives you the VR helmet and leaves
Before you leave the apartment building pan to the right to the doorway into the building ndash there rsquo s a note pinned to the right side of the door frame Pick up the note and examine it a family member named Izzet is desperately looking for Mehmet Now pick up the newspaper lying on the front step below the note It contains an interesting news story about the smuggling and recovery of the ruby ring and you can check your horoscope on the other side as well
Leave the apartment location and on the map view choose the VR helmet in the bottom right corner to enter thebasilica simulation The date of the simulation is AD although the following voiceover describes the discovery of the cistern in the thcentury Walk forward but there isn rsquo t anything more than construction rubble on the ground here Return to your original location there rsquo s only one way back and head off to the right of the right hand workers rsquo ramp Move forward one more step you can now spot the greenish lines that indicate that the simulation is not complete
You hear the voice of the architect describing the design and construction of the building
Turn to the right and move forward ndash a large unfinished section of the simulation is visible Pan around until you see the key missing component ndash a patterned column that looks suspiciously like the tear column from the actual basilica We know where to find that scan Exit the simulation immediately and go the realBasilica Cisternon the map view
Once inside walk down the stairs head off to the left make a right turn and look over to the left to see the column Click to get a close up take the scanner out and scan away hellip oops ndash it looks as if it is too humid down here to get the scanner to work We rsquo ll have to find an alternative location Back away turn around and make your way back out the cistern to the map view Ask the Experts Perhaps Nuray may be of some assistance Go toAya Sofya proceed inside the main hall to the coronation circles and go off to the left and into the library where we saw here during our last visit to the church But she rsquo s not here Return to the front entrance hall and make your way upstairs go right of the main exterior door Enter the second room accessible to the right of the balcony and find Nuray admiring one of the mosaics She gives us a piece of paper indicating that it isn rsquo t safe to talk
Examine the paper ndash on the other side she has jotted down the locations that she and Emre had visited and researched including Aya Sofya the Basilica Cistern and the Forum of Theodosius Make your way back to the front entrance and exit the church
Perhaps a quick trip to theArchaeological Museumis in order Enter the main building and proceed into the room to the left of the stairs in the lobby
Pan around until you spot Hillary Peebles standing here Engage him in conversation and use the following suggested conversation path to learn some interesting tidbits Is there anything hellip
Have you ever heard hellip
I rsquo m trying to track hellip Do any of the ruins hellip
and Thanks He needs to see the exact column you are interested in so take out that snapshot of the Tear column that we found in the Basilica Cistern pamphlet and show Hillary He indicates that theForum of Theodosiusis where we will find such a column Feel free to ask him any other questions make your way back out of the museum and back to the map view
Running With the Devil Find theForum of Theodosiuson the map view and click to travel there The columns are located off to your right ndash find the one you can approach and click for a close up This is a good place to save your game trust me Take out your scanner and scan in the column ndash it automatically uploads into the simulation
Click away from the scanner view and Carlo jumps out from behind the column wielding the knife like a sushi chef Immediately back away from him you have about seconds to do this before he gets you After backing away you can either go left towards some empty sidewalk displays or to the right along the sidewalk ahead Follow the sidewalk to the right You then get another choice ndash left towards some grass and more sidewalk or right towards a small area with a police truck parked behind Chose the left option and find yourself encountering Eskander from the University who by chance is walking by
Eskander calms you down and brings you to theGalata Towerfor a drink Since you don rsquo t really know this guy be conservative with your answers to his questions Use the following conversation path The police think hellip I know who really hellip and Yes Eskander advises us to let the police handle it and invites us to an awards dinner at the Hotel De Londres Once he departs exit the tower just turn around and return to the map view
Before returning to the simulation hop on over toIstanbulUniversityto check in with Sharife Don rsquo t skip through the introduction movie this time ndash just as you arrive an agitated and upset Mehmet approaches you and warns you to end your investigation immediately After he wanders off continue on to the computer lab and walk inside
Sharife is nowhere to be seen ndash pan to the right of her usual position in front of the computers and click on the desk in the corner You will find a hand written note on a file of KLIO access records that suggests you have been accessing the KLIO database for months
Someone is trying to frame you Eskander Back away and click on the top of the bookcase to the left of the desk You can peruse Sharife rsquo s page grant proposal for the KLIO system Once finished back away and return to the map view Click on the VR helmet to return to thecistern simulation
Picking Up the Pieces Inside the simulation proceed off to the left then straight forward and then to the right You should arrive at the missing tear column Grab your scan of the column from your inventory and click on the column ndash this allows KLIO to extrapolate the remainder of the simulated location
Pan to the left and pick up the pile of rope that has appeared on the ground behind you Continue panning to the left and grab an iron implement on the floor here Pan a bit to the right again and return towards the starting point of the simulation At your new location panning to the right will reveal three objects to pick up off the floor here an angled engineering frame a wooden rod and a brass implement
Keep turning to the right and move forward another step towards the starting point of the simulation From your new location you will find three wooden supports to pick up ndash two are located a bit to the right and the third is right behind you Continue on to the simulation rsquo s starting point and pick up the ropes and forceps on the ground here Move forward towards that dead end we visited when we first arrived in the simulation and pick up the wooden wheel located on the floor at the dead end
Return all the way back to the tear column and continue forward to a wall Turn around and pick up a square shaped engineering framework Turn back to face the wall turn to your left and proceed ahead Once you stop turn around and click on the floor in front of the Medusa head There are a number of lighter coloured tiles that must be ldquo opened rdquo using the iron implement from your inventory ndash take it out and click on the tiles to open them We end up with smaller holes that surround a double sided hole with a quadruple sized hole located to the left of the others
Some Assembly Required We now must assemble some sort of hoist mechanism to lift the stone inside the largest hole to the left You may recall that the assembled mechanism was pictured in a book on Emre rsquo s shelf in his apartment If you can rsquo t recall that picture or didn rsquo t sketch it out you may want to return there now and have another look
If you wish exit the simulation go toEmre rsquo s apartment enter the living room click on the shelf below the hanging lute and click on the book titled ldquo Roman Engineering rdquo Stare at the sketch until you got it tattooed on your brain exit the apartment return to the map view click on the VR helmet and proceed back to the assembly area
Follow these easy steps to assemble your brand new lifting discombobulator Place the rectangular shaped engineering frame in the two right most holes Put the angled engineering frame in the two holes located immediately to the right of the big hole Insert the engineering support with the full circle cut out in the remaining small hole at the back between the two engineering supports Place one of the engineering supports with the half circle cut out in the ldquo back rdquo part of the double sized hole Put the wooden rod on top of the two supports already in place Place the wheel on the portion of the rod sticking out at the front Place the remaining support in the front portion of the double sided hole Grab the ropes and click on the centre of the angled engineering frame to stretch out the cords between the two frameworks Grab the forceps and rope and click on the top of the angled frame to place them above the large hole in the ground Now that the apparatus has been assembled click on the large hole on the left to get a close up of two gold medallions with medusa heads on them The object here is to position the medallions using the bronze implement to match the poem written on a piece of paper we picked up in Emre rsquo s apartment If you have to exit the simulation and look through your inventory until you find it ndash the poem mentions one head on its chin and one on its cheek
Grab the bronze implement and click on the upper medallion to insert it into the holes Now click on the end of the implement that shows a ldquo hand rdquo cursor a ldquo pick up rdquo cursor is shown on the other end of the implement Keep clicking until the head is upright on its chin Pick up the implement by clicking on the other end and place it on the bottom medallion Rotate the medallion until the head is lying on its right cheek The block below will pop up allowing access with the forceps
Back away and click on the hanging forceps to lower and position them around the block Now click on the wheel ndash the hoist will lift the block up Pick up the iron implement from your inventory while the block is still being lifted and immediately after the hoist stops quickly insert the implement into the lower left portion of the wheel ndash this prevents the hoist from lowering the block again This may take a few tries since it doesn rsquo t give you much time Click on the hole below the block pick up the silver fan and then exit the completed simulation
Izzet Stradlin rsquo You can pop by theUniversity but Sharife is still away so take this opportunity to track down Mehmet rsquo s relative Izzet at thebook bazaar remember the note on Emre rsquo s door
After arriving at the bazaar you are accosted by a trinket merchant hawking his wares Try following the following conversation path Sounds like you speak hellip Some of these things hellip That rsquo s a little too steep hellip You know that rsquo s still hellip I rsquo ll buy it
You end up with a useless stone on a necklace check your inventory but have earned some personal capital with the seller
Show the merchant the sun shaped pin ndash he indicates that it is a Greek design from the Temple of Artemis Try showing him the bug shaped ring ndash he says it rsquo s a valueless souvenir Back away from the merchant and pan to your left until you see a small table near the corner of a fenced in treed area Clicking on the table gives a close up view of some stained glass men the same type as those on Emre rsquo s apartment window
Back away and pan to your left until you see a short man standing beside his books Click on Izzet to engage him in conversation about Mehmet Use the following conversation path to gain information and avoid angering Izzet I rsquo m looking for Mehmet hellip I saw Mehmet hellip Where do you think hellip
Did Mehmet rsquo s gambling hellip
What did Emre do
I rsquo m sorry hellip
After your conversation ends click on the book display to the left of Izzet and click on the newspaper behind Izzet in the close up of the book display The paper contains a story about the recent illegal sale of a silver fan in Vienna ndash our virtual prize from the cistern simulation Find the hotspot on the books below the newspaper and click on the red book in the close up view ndash Izzet mentions that Emre has made notes in the margins and gives the book to us The third hotspot located on the books near the top of the display allows you to peruse ldquo Presnel Astrono rdquo containing the constellations and symbols of the zodiac
Back away from the display and examine the red book that Izzet has given to us Chapter discusses the Ephesian Letters and Emre rsquo s notes list ldquo Arasta Shop rdquo Is this a new location Exit the bazaar location and make your way to theArasta Bazaar
Get Happy
After arriving at theArasta pan to your right and enter the open doorway An extremely enthusiastic shop keeper greets you after his introduction peruse the following locations in his shop Sneak a peak at the swords on the wall to the left of the shopkeeper ldquo Not very sharp rdquo Click on the hotspot in the upper central portion of the wall to the left of the swords to view some ceramics ldquo My grandmother rsquo s favourite rdquo Click below the ceramics of the floor to view some novel folding chairs View a close up of some brass lanterns hanging on a beam up and to the left of the ceramics ldquo It rsquo s very very new rdquo Click on the small pile of brown bags on the low bench to the right of the entrance and grab the bottom left bag
The shopkeeper examines your selection and offers a price ndash accept his offer and take the bag of Ephesian letters He will ask you a follow up question ndash go ahead and admit that you know Emre and the shopkeeper will tell you what he knows about Mehmet rsquo s exporting practices in Vienna Exit the shop and return to the map view
You can pop by theUniversityagain but Sharife is still nowhere to be found Eskander mentioned something about a dinner in his honour at theHotel De Londres so proceed to the hotel to see if Sharife is in attendance The hotel rsquo s lounge is empty except for a solitary figure at the bar ndash the detective Akalin Play it straight with him and you rsquo ll learn some important new information I rsquo ve got some more hellip Carlo tried to kill hellip Did you get any hellip
Mehmet rsquo s dead
This all revolves hellip and My name is on the hellip
After he rsquo s finished with you exit the hotel and head to theArchaeological Museum Enter the main building climb the stairs and walk into the curator rsquo s office Show her the Roman themed book from the bazaar and use the following conversation path Where is Ephesus
How does Alexander hellip
Do you know hellip
and He rsquo s the consultant hellip Afterward show her both the sun disk it rsquo s Greek and the bug shaped ring it rsquo s worthless
Exit the curator rsquo s office and return to the map view Once more travel to theUniversity and enter Sharife rsquo s lab She is standing in front of her desk with her back to you Speak to her ndash Sharife rsquo s one word answers indicate she rsquo s been warned about you from others Use the following conversation path to convince her to open up the Temple of Ephesus simulation to you I rsquo ve replaced those hellip According to KLIO hellip Have you checked hellip
Emre was studying hellip Then I rsquo d like hellip What have you hellip
I rsquo m the only lead hellip and Help me Sharife She relents and you enter theCelcus at Ephesus simulation
Temple of Doom Listen to the voiceover and then approach the temple You will note statues along the front of the building ndash each can be approached for a closer look The statues represent wisdom virtue thought and knowledge from left to right There is also a game located on the steps of the temple with the object to place three stones of the same colour in a row while preventing your opponent from doing the same ndash a more complicated version of tic tac toe I did manage to beat the computer once but I can rsquo t seem to repeat the feat Try playing around with this game but don rsquo t sweat it if you cannot win ndash it isn rsquo t necessary to advance our investigation
Enter the temple building turn to your left and walk towards the window here Pick up the scroll and examine it ndash a dedication decree Back away turn to the centre of the room and approach the main table Several voiceovers are available by clicking on some of the objects on the desk Pick up the paper in the centre of the table ndash it rsquo s a scroll that mentions the possible presence of a gold bust of Alexander the Great
Back away again pan to the right and approach a shelf of scrolls There are a total of five voiceovers that can be triggered by clicking on various scrolls ndash a combination of letters historical facts decrees and bible passages There are also two scrolls that can be picked up one in the centre of the top shelf describing the founding of Ephesus and another located near the right side of the bottom shelf a poem
Back away and proceed towards the narrow doorway to the right of the scroll shelf Click on the top panel of the door for a close up view The simulation indicates that this is an Ephesian letter locking mechanism ndash seven disks with different labels are shown on the door the seven labels are Earth Sun Light Wisdom Virtue Thought and Knowledge ndash the last four match the statues outside We don rsquo t seem to have what this puzzle is asking for so exit the simulation and return to theUniversity
Tales from the Crypt Open up the small bag obtained from the shop at theArasta and scan the individual stone tiles using the KLIO scanner While you rsquo re at it try scanning in various other items from your inventory ndash you rsquo ll find that the images of the bug ring and the sun disk can be added to the KLIO database
Give the scanner to Sharife to upload the data and return into thesimulation Return into the temple and approach the narrow doorway to the right
Grab one of the scanned tiles from your inventory and hold it over each of the seven disks on the door ndash you will quickly see that only four of the disks the ones that match the statues outside the temple can receive new labels Since Sun Earth and Light are already on the door you must find the correct match for the Sea Dark Year and Truth tiles Try matching up combinations that make sense Truth seems to match up best with ldquo Knowledge rdquo Year matches best with ldquo Wisdom rdquo Dark matches with ldquo Thought rdquo and by default Sea goes with ldquo Virtue rdquo Place these four tiles on the correct disks and the door will open You are ushered down a staircase and along a passageway to a stone crypt
Immediately the simulation warns of instability and anomalous data ndash clearly there rsquo s a problem with the image here Do we recall the location of another crypt in our travels around Istanbul that we could scan into KLIO If you said ldquo yes ndash theArchaeological Museum rdquo you rsquo re a smart cookie
Exit the simulation leave the computer lab and travel to the museum This time walk to the left of the main building where there are a number of statues present find the magnifying glass icon between the two buildings again The crypt is located to the right of the statue of the human figure ndash click to get a close up and then use your scanner to save the image
Back away twice and then pan to the left to see Akalin and Nuray arguing in Turkish Once the detective leaves engage Nuray in conversation and choose any of the conversation choices Afterward return to the map view proceed to theUniversity give the scanner to Sharife and then re enter thesimulation Make your way through the narrow doorway inside the temple down to the unstable crypt Use the new crypt image to restore stability Now examine the bowl located in front of the crypt You should recognize the sun symbol on the bottom of the bowl
Hard to Miss Artemis Use the sun disk scan from your inventory on the bottom of the bowl ndash this activates some sort of sub simulation devised by Emre We are taken to theTemple of Artemis Pan around near the floor and spot three whitish items lying on the floor here Pick each item up and examine one in your inventory ndash these are silver ingots with strange symbols and constellations inscribed into them In fact each represents a sign of the zodiac ndash implying that there are another nine of these ingots to collect
Enter the main chamber of the temple and pick up another five of the ingots on the floor in here A large statue of Artemis lies at the end of the room with an offering table in the foreground Click on the offering table to see where nine of the twelve ingots must be placed in a certain order We rsquo ll need to come back here when we rsquo ve collected all of the bricks
Exit the main chamber and continue straight out the front door of the temple Another two ingots can be found out here on the front steps along with some other offerings Listen to the voiceover and then move off to the left of the offerings to reach another part of the temple rsquo s exterior One more ingot can be found here on the steps Listen to the voiceover return to the front of the temple and re enter the building
We are only missing one more of the ingots Facing the entrance to the main room pan to the right to the double doors and then click on the small locking mechanism visible immediately to the right of the doorway The ldquo bug shaped rdquo indentation should look familiar ndash take the bug ring image out of your inventory and click on the lock to open the doors You are whisked up to the second floor balcony
What rsquo s Your Sign
Step forward and turn to your left to admire the head of the Artemis statue In fact click on her head for a close up The statue wears a peculiar necklace made up of nine circles ndash each representing a sign of the zodiac Some of the signs are hard to make out but the one furthest to the right is a crab Cancer and the one immediately to its left is obviously a lion Leo The fifth circle along the chain is a scorpion Scorpio Back away and continue along the balcony over to the other side of the room it will take you two steps You should find the last remaining ingot on the ground here Sneak another peak at Artemis rsquo necklace from this side ndash the symbol farthest to the left is a fish Pisces
Back away proceed back along the balcony and return to the first floor Take this opportunity to examine some of the ingots ndash unless you are a master of the horoscope at least some of the symbols will look unfamiliar to you We will need a helpful source to learn more about the symbols Remember the horoscope from the newspaper we took from Emre rsquo s front stoop that contained the daily readings Exit the simulation and return toSharife rsquo s lab
Examine the newspaper and turn it over to find the horoscope section Copy down the symbols as depicted in the newspaper Are there any further clues as to the identity of the nine correct symbols and their order Starting with Pisces move downward through the list of symbols and start again at the top when you reach the bottom of the list ndash the fifth symbol is Scorpio the eighth is Leo and the ninth is Cancer This string which excludes Aries Taurus and Gemini probably makes up our set of nine necklace symbol You can return to the statue to confirm this if you wish
Return to thesimulation and enter the main room of the Temple of Artemis Approach the offering table and place the nine symbols in order from left to right Pisces looks like a stylized ldquo H rdquo Aquarius two wavy parallel lines Capricorn a jagged line with several angles Sagittarius a line with an arrow running through it on an angle Scorpio an ldquo M rdquo with an arrow at the end Libra two parallel lines one of which has a bump in it Virgo an ldquo M rdquo that loops back over the right end of the letter Leo a small circle with a curving line coming out of it Cancer two ldquo rdquo s lying on their sides The three remaining blocks ndash Aries a small loop with two curving horns Taurus a circle with two horns coming out of it and Gemini a four sided shape with loops at each corner are not used Once the blocks are placed correctly the statue lifts to reveal the gold bust of Alexander the Great hellip then the simulation is unexpectedly cut off Back in thelab Sharife is incensed at this hidden sub simulation and asks you to leave
Make your way over toEmre rsquo s apartment and pick up another newspaper on the front stoop The paper contains a story about Mehmet rsquo s death and mentions you as a suspect
Under Construction Time to check out that tip about the antiquities consultant Jeremy Carpenter ndash head tothe Book Bazaar Jeremy is standing by Izzet rsquo s booth Engage him in conversation by showing him your press pass and use the following path to avoid angering him Just your basic hellip I heard that you hellip You rsquo re a translator hellip Have you hellip

Now that we rsquo ve learned that Gordian Construction has been involved in all of the digs it rsquo s time to pay them a visit Exit the museum return to the map view and travel to theGordian Constructionoffices ndash right next door to Carlo rsquo s Nargile Bar You arrive in the middle of a narrow street ndash pan to the left past the white car and click on the accessible doorway the one below the poster in the building here The door is locked so we rsquo ll have to come back later
Pan back to the right and find the entrance to Gordian Construction in the peach coloured building on the other side of the street The address No
can be seen in the close up view Click on the small keypad to the left of the door for a further close up Evidently we rsquo ll need some sort of numerical code to gain access to this building Back away pan left towards the white car again and click above the car to travel up the street
That rsquo s the Ticket One more click in the centre of the screen brings you to theNargile Bar ndash maybe we can figure out the Gordian door code here Lucky for you the place is empty except for the guy smoking the water pipe The only information that we have about the bar is that you can probably gamble here and the note from Mehmet rsquo s notebook that we used the pencil to uncover ldquo Nargile Fri Eggplant Tuesday Oranges rdquo You can sneak a peak at the bar rsquo s preferred pastime if you pan to the right of the counter area and click on a table in the empty part of the bar ndash dominoes
Pan back to the bar rsquo s counter and click on the small rack of dominoes and the lime to examine them more closely Is the presence of the lime telling us something Combine this with Mehmet rsquo s note and deduce that the lime is related to the day of the week and therefore the numbers on the dominoes Find the four green numbers and This may be our code Back away and pan to the left until you see the small staircase leading down to the basement Better save that game now ndash we rsquo ve got a timed sequence ahead
Descend the stairs and then enter the room beyond the wooden door We rsquo ve only got to minutes before someone nasty you know who
shows up so act fast First find the second shelf of the bookcase it should be to the right of your current position and click for a close up Take a baggage claim ticket and a note from the box labelled ldquo Tombeki rdquo Next back away pan to the left a bit and try to move towards the other side of the room All you get is a close up view of a garbage can Pick out two pieces of paper a used claims ticket and a half burned note and back away
Now turn around and click on the desk behind you Click on the blue imprinting machine on the left side of the desk and pick up the small metal plate lying in front of the machine in the close up view Immediately pick it up from inventory and place it in the middle of the machine Now place the blank baggage claims ticket over top of the plate Click the left side of the imprinting machine to imprint the plate on the ticket and then pick up the newly printed ticket Finally pan to the right of the desk and exit the wood doorway in the wall
You will find yourself back on the street in front ofGordian Construction Take this opportunity to view what you rsquo ve liberated from the Nargile basement You rsquo ve managed to create a bogus baggage claims ticket like the one in the trash can The burnt note appears to be in Italian and the final note seems to confirm the code information obtained in the bar
The Best Laid Plans Before making your raid on the Gordian offices return to the map view pan to your left and go to theBazaar Show the burned paper to the trinket salesman ndash his translation includes ldquo must be sure rdquo ldquo thof March rdquo ldquo journalist rdquo and ldquo evidence rdquo Exit the bazaar and returnto Gordian Construction Click on the doorway again go to the close up of the keypad and punch in ldquo rdquo ndash click on the door to open it and enter the lobby Continue straight ahead andbe sure to save your game before entering the elevator
Clicking on the elevator door takes you directly into the company board room You don rsquo t have much time before a security guard nabs you for arrest so find the dark portfolio on the right end of the big table Click on it to open and then take the papers located inside You can also look at the entries on the left side of the book ndash The Herodotus Foundation and Carlo Genevese are both definitely involved with Gordian Construction
Back away and feel free to examine any all of the following items just do it quickly
Building plans on surface of main table Glass dish on left side of side table located to the right of the main table Upper drawer on the side table contains more building plans Lower drawer on the side table contains newspapers Shelf in the library area to the right of the side table there are two art doodads to look at here ndash a cone in a glass container and a decorative bull
Exit via the door to the left of the board room table click forward to enter the elevator and exit the building through the red door Return to the map view by proceeding in the opposite direction from the white car
Sharife isn rsquo t at theUniversity so try theHotel De Londres ndash and run into Eskander at the bar Show him the documents lifted from the Gordian office and choose the following path to hear who he thinks is the mastermind What is Herodotus
How did Gordian hellip
and How is Herodotus hellip
Eskander implores you to take these documents to the police as soon as possible
The police are hanging out at theArchaeological Museum but following Eskander rsquo s advice is a bad move here ndash the cops will arrest you for document theft smuggling and murder Instead travel to theGalata Towerwhere Sharife is contemplating life Show her the papers and choose conversation option I don rsquo t believe hellip Sharife is convinced that Eskander rsquo s computer files will contain enough to prove his guilt You are automatically transferred to theUniversity and enter theAya Sofyasimulation
Note There is an alternative course to follow after leaving the Gordian Construction office Go first to themuseumand show the documents to Akalin ndash they aren rsquo t enough to prove Eskander rsquo s guilt so he tells you to go Eskander has now left the hotel so go directly to theGalata Tower and use the following conversation path on Sharife after showing her the papers What is Herodotus
How did Gordian hellip
How is Herodotus hellip
and So Eskander hellip
Sofya After Dark Move forward through the main doors of the church and then pan to your left There is a curious looking circular panel on the floor here ndash click on it to travel into a small stone space Pan around until you see the barred window overlooking a series of computer generated grid lines ndash an exit out of the simulation perhaps Look upward until you can see the way back up into the church and click to travel there
Move forward again towards the business end of the church You will encounter a number of voiceovers as you make your way around the church ndash most discuss the sacking of Aya Sofya in the thcentury Pan to your left and walk towards the side of the church You will find a purple urn on the floor here next to a stone pillar Examine the urn and learn that it symbolizes the Empress Theodora Turn around and walk back into the centre of the church Turn to your left and walk towards the altar area at the end of the room You will find an orb representing the Emperor Justinian and a chalice representing the emperor rsquo s Patriarch on a bench Pick both up and return one step back into the centre of the church Click on the ornate screen and mouse over the coronation circle on the floor here There seems to be some sort of puzzle to solve Return to the centre of the room and proceed back to and through the main doors of the church Facing the outside doors pan to the right and spot a helmet sitting on a bench Grab the helmet symbolizing the emperor rsquo s general and proceed down this hallway to the right Inside the doors pick up the lantern representing the emperor rsquo s historian sitting on the floor and then proceed through the doors to the right
On the second floor pan to the left until a large red compass comes into view Pick up the compass representing the emperor rsquo s architect and then pan around until you find the opening to the balcony room Proceed onto the balcony and pick up the flower and vase symbolizing the general rsquo s wife sitting on the top of the railing Note the Empress rsquo s omphalos on the floor ndash the spot where she would stand during the Coronation
Putting Them in Their Place By now you rsquo ve probably guessed what must be done ndash the ldquo objects rdquo must be placed in such a way as to mimic the coronation ceremony If you rsquo ve got no idea which objects need to be placed where in the church exit the simulation and consult ldquo The Book of Ceremonies rdquo from your real life inventory that rsquo s the game rsquo s real life not YOUR real life
I believe that the applicable passage is on page three of the book First the patriarch general and architect in that order stand in the outer sections of the coronation circle next the Empress stands in her omphalos up on the balcony and finally the emperor enters the inner portion of the coronation circle The historian and the general rsquo s wife are not needed for the ceremony
Return to the simulation and proceed over to the coronation circle in the main room Place the chalice bottom left corner helmet upper left corner and compass right side around the main circle in that order Now walk back to the main doors proceed up to the balcony and place the purple urn on the empress rsquo s omphalos Finally return to the main floor and walk to the coronation circle You may want to save your game here as its going to get a little hairy from here on in Place the orb in the centre of the circle and listen to Justinian speak
The simulation gurgles and a gold diadem is revealed under the centre circle Grab the treasure but heed the warnings from the simulation that the police are on their way and that the simulation is collapsing You rsquo ve got about seconds to get out or everything shuts down Back away from the circle pan to the right and move back into the centre of the room Facing the main doors find the trap door in the floor we found earlier and click there
As you move into the stone chamber the simulation dissolves around you and the computer places you within another simulation Eskander rsquo s hard drive
Ooey GUI Your final task is to navigate through Eskander rsquo s hard drive and transfer incriminating files out of the system ndash all in the span of about minutes the voiceover will start counting down your time left from seconds You may want to save your game again before continuing From your present location do the following Move forward one step Turn to the left and move forward Turn to the right and move forward Turn to the left and move forward Turn to the right and move forward Turn to the right and move forward Turn to the left and move forward This route takes you directly to the knot a circular area with models of the treasures that the smugglers have stolen using KLIO There is a square opening in the wall directly in front of you ndash click here to enter a graphical interface of Eskander rsquo s file storage system
Clicking on the four main directories brings up sub directories of files Since the incriminating evidence would mostly be transactions between Herodotus and Gordian click on the KNOT directory and grab the ldquo Transaction rdquo files from the box that pops up
Now to transfer the files out of the system Holding the files click on the interface port located directly above the ldquo EXPORT rdquo label in the bottom right corner of the screen Choose your outgoing destination by clicking on the ldquo Computer Lab rdquo label located below and to the right of the interface port ndash this will light up some blinkers around the name Finally click on the interface port again to send the files out of the system
