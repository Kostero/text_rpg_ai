GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
HQ II Walkthrough brief So we find ourselves in Shapeir
An oasis in the middle of the vast desert
We start in the Katta's Tail Inn talking to Abdulla
Talk to him and he will tell you that you should explore the town
But to do this effectively you will need a map of the town layout
The Inn isn't the place to look for such a thing so we decide to leave this place
When exiting the Inn we enter a plaza and in one corner there is a fellow trying to sell some junk like ashtrays t shirts maps Hey did he say map
That's exactly what we need now
But when talking the man we soon find out that the money from spielburg isn't accepted here
Fortunately there is a moneychanger in this town and if you follow the instructions Ali Chicha gives you you will eventually find her
After exchanging your money for Shapeir money return to the stand of Ali Chicha
Buy the map and compass from him
Now we have taken the first step to exploring the town
During the following or so days all we'll have to do is to defeat several elementals attacking the town
But there are other fun things to do as well
The Magic User will want to become a member of the WIT
To become a such You will first have to find where it's located
There are two magicians in this town that you can ask Keapon Laffin and Aziza
However none of those will tell you much
Perhaps give a pointer
To find WIT you will have to use the spell Detect magic to locate a certain cul de sac
When you think you have found the right spot cast an Open spell to enter WIT
Once inside WIT you will be asked why you seek admittance answer something like magic and will be asked to choose a mentor
You can see pictures of different persons among them Aziza
But she says she don't know you well enough
Hmm Who is it on that painting
Remember ol' Erasmus
Well he seems to remember you and despite much moaning from other Wizards he can be chosen as your mentor
Then all you have to do is to pass those tests The first test is in a dark room where you will have to use detect magic fetch and trigger to perform what Erasmus ask youto do
Then it's on to the path of Wizardry
You do not want to remain there however no matter what the other wizards say
The Thief should seek out the moneychanger for more than one reason
She just happens to be the local thieves' guild and she will give you an assignment if you identify yourself as a thief
Just follow her directions and remember to lift the rug
if surprised just hide in the closet but be sure you've oiled the hinges first As a reward for a well done assignment she will then give you directions as to where more money can be found
The Fighter will later be given the opportunity to join the EOF ask the adventurers' guild manager about this but it will take some time before this happens
When it does just follow the instructions you get the letters left at the adventurers' guild and simply break the chains when you're going to be 'executed'
The Town of Shapeir In the town there are the following locations of interestThe saurus pen
Here you can buy your own riding saurus on day or The Katta's Tail Inn Retire here when it's time to sleep
Also Omar the prophet will speak here on occasion The Alchemist
Here you can buy pills and sell different ingredients
You can also buy the incense that will be needed do defeat the fire elemental later on
Ask Harik on fire since this is his specialty
He will also be able to mix up some dispel potions for you The Magic Shop
This shop is run by Keapon Laffin a person attuned to the element of air
He can provide information on the element of air as well as spells and a magic rope
If asked for he will give away fool's earth
or something like that The fountain plaza
Here you can fill your waterskins get dirt from the florist but a brass lamp to contain a fire elemental and buy food Aziza
The enchantress will let you in if you answer her questions
You can then then get information about the different elementals and the enchanted tree in the desert
While she tells something about all the elementals she is most attuned to the element of water Palace plaza
I think this is the place to buy a cloth bag that will be used to store a earth elemental later on
Aside from that the only thing that can be obtained here is a pin that you're given as a gift after defeating the elementals Fighter plaza
Here you should find Rakeesh a paladin and a noble warrior
He can lend you a magical flaming sword to defeat the earth elemental
He can also tell you 'bout the element of earth Blacksmith
This man sells swords and daggers and also like arm wrestling
It's a good way to add to your strength
Also on his sign hangs the bellows that you will use to capture the air elemental Adventurers' guild
Here you can train sign your name in the book and find different quests on the board Astrologer
You can get your future told here
If there's anything more to do I admit I missed it Moneychanger
As have been said you change money here and get assignments if a thief Nest of the griffin
Can be found if walking left along the cliffs when entering the desert
Scare the griffin away and then use the magic rope or levitate to get a feather
This can be tricky Enchanted tree
Follow the cliffs to the right when entering the desert to get here Oasis of the dervish
Ask the guard at the town gate for instructions on how to find this place
What you want here is some of the dervish' beard
On to the quest When you've familiarized yourself with the Town the elementals should start to appear The first one is the fire elemental that will ravage the gates plaza one day after it's first heard of
To defeat this hot head get some incense that you spread on the ground
Then lead the elemental into the alley and place the brass lamp on the ground
When You run out of incense use a full waterskin to force the elemental into the lamp
Viola you now have a magic lamp Four days later an air elemental will appear in the palace plaza
This guy really doesn't like dirt so if you throw some at him he'll be paralyzed for a while
When paralyzed the elemental fit just nicely in the bellows The next challenge is the Earth elemental
It will roam the streets of the town an can be encountered anywhere buy in the plazas
To defeat it you'll have to use fire
The two ways to do this is to use either the flame dart spell or Rakeesh's Soulforge
Be sure to collect the remains in a cloth bag The last threat to the city is a water elemental appearing in the fountain tain
The only thing that can drive it from the fountain is the air elemental captured in the bellows
It can then be captured in an empty waterskin The last important thing to do before leaving with the caravan to Raseir is to have Harik make dispel potions
To do this he needs some ingredientsss dients
All of those you should already have collected except for one The missing ingredient is the 'Fruit of Compassion'
To obtain this you will need to visit Aziza and ask her on the plant
Then get to the tree and give it water while telling it about yourself
Give it earth and tell it about your deeds
Lastly give it a hug and tell her her name
Julanar The tree will now bear fruit and Harik should be able to make the potions
some things are omitted here but those pose no problems while playing the game On to Raseir You will now travel to the town of Raseir where evil rules
After entering the town enter the Blue Parrot
There you'll find the head of the thieves' guild in Raseir a really slimy guy
He will have you steal a statuette of a falcon from the captain of the guard
But first you should meet a lady in distress
She wants your pass so that she can get out of the city
Of course that means YOU cant get out anymore but we're supposed to be heroes aren't we
Give her your clothes and pass and then you'll get a mirror in exchange
Now to stealing the statue
Enter the central plaza sneaking and wait 'till the guard disappears
as soon as it gets dark Then use the magic rope or the levitate spell to get to the window on the second floor
Enter the room within and steal the statue from the cabinet
once again you'll have to use oil to make sure those hinges doesn't make any sound Upon returning to the 'Blue Parrot' you will be arrested as soon as you leave the tavern
In the prison Remember the pin the Katta gave you
Remember what associations it gave you
Well after talking to the Katta in the cell and showing him the pin You skillfully use the pin to pick the lock to the cell
The Katta then show you a secret passage leading out of here
Don't forget your gear though
At the other end you will part just to run into Ad Avis
He will hypnotize you and you will suddenly find yourself in the lost city
The crypt
Since the prophecy seems unwilling to fulfill itself you'll have to help it a bit
With the help of the mirror the stars will suddenly be in the correct positions and the door to the crypt will open
Ad Avis will then urge you to go into the crypt
Again you will fight the elements
This time Water is the first to oppose you as an underwater stream block your way
Every now and then there floats past a log could this be of any help
On the other side of the stream there's a hole in the wall which creates a strong wind
Use force bolt ore brute force to block the hole and you've negated the second element
You can then traverse the path to the room with boiling lava
Once in there it helps to keep cool if you find this hard you should pour something on yourself
On the other side of the lava you will find a cliff and a door below it
To get down use the rope or the spell levitate
Once you approach the door it will start asking nosy questions
only one actually The answer to the question could be discerned from conversation with Abdulla but why you should think of doing this before you get the question I don't know
The answer is 'Suleiman' Ben Daoud I think The only thing now standing between you and the statue of Iblis is the treasury
Just don't take any of those goodies and you'll get through this room without problems
Now you enter the room where the statue of Iblis is located
The final battle Just before you reach the statue Ad Avis appears out of thin air
He then seal the cave and leave you there to die
Fortunately Ad Avis has mis interpreted the prophecy and when looking carefully you will find a ring on a stalagmite containing 'He who is left behind'
This being is a djinn and has the power to grant wishes
Since you have three you can use two to improve your character while using the last to teleport back to Raseir
Once here you again meet the Katta from the cell and he tells you that you should sneak into the palace while the Kattas keeps the guards busy
sneaking to the palace you see a handkerchief tied to the battlement
Wait until the guard moves away and then levitate or climb to where the hanky is
You now enter the harem
Wish one could stay there sigh
After a long scene you will sneak past the eunuchs guarding the harem
Now we find ourselves watching how Ad Avis is freeing Iblis
Since this is something that should be avoided our task is to stop him but how
It is essential to stop him from finishing the ritual and since you cant get him from here you must use the rope to get to the tower
Once there you can throw a dagger at one of the candles and break the spell
However this will upset Ad Avis
He will do his best to kill you but if you duck and throw daggers at him you should be able to kill him
I had a hard time doing this mainly because I never got across the rope fast enough to stop Ad Avis from freeing Iblis Now all you have to do is to relax and watch the ending scene you have completed Quest For Glory II Trial By Fire

Level First leave the village and collect the Ghoul Cube
Get the Ghoul Cube from the Raven your uncle at the crossroads
Until you collect this you won't be able to collect objects
Getting into Uncle's House Go back to village where you started and enter the Slaughtered Ham pub
Note that the jukebox is broken
Next to the jukebox is Billy Uncle's groundskeeper
Talk to Billy
If you ask the right questions he will eventually hand over the Key to Uncle's front gate
While you are in the pub talk to the Policeman playing darts
This will open up conversations that you can then have with the man trapped in the gibbet at the crossroads
The man in the gibbet owns the car you will come across later
Talk to the guys at the bar
Pick a fight using conversation choices
After the Vicar intervenes go and talk to the Vicar
After the correct choice of conversation the Vicar will allow you to collect the Glass of Water
Head towards Uncle's house out of the village and right at the crossroads
On the way note the Mapstone on the outskirts of the village a pointy monolith of rock with a pentagram etched on it
There are six Mapstones in total
Each one you find and use will then be available in order to jump locations between Mapstones
This significantly cuts down on legwork
Mapstones must be used and not just seen in order to be used by other Mapstones
Collect Imps on your way out of the village
There is one at the end of each alley in the village one behind the cross outside the pub one behind the wall on your right when approaching the crossroads an d one in the backseat of the car which you pass after turning right at the crossroads
You now have five Imps
Go past the car the graveyard and the next building on your right is uncle's house
Use the Key on the gate and it will open before your eyes
Inside Uncle's House A hideous creature Gore blocks the stairs to the next level
In order to reach Level you will need four ingredients for a potion that will turn Gore back into his normal self
The pot to make the potion lies in the backup laboratory in the basement
This is reachable via the ladder going down in the entrance hall to your left
As you find each of the four main ingredients you must use place them in this pot
The four ingredients are the Local Brew in the cellar of the pub guarded by the landlady who can be distracted by putting on a show the Illuminous Fungus found in the basement underneath the Shack in the Dark Woods the Vampire's Teeth taken from the sleeping vampire in the graveyard when he takes them out to sleep at night and the Light of the Pharaohs found in Egypt reached via a time portal located on the other side of the swamp
While you are here collect the Lamp from Gore's Bedroom in Uncle's House the room with Gore's pet rat
Read the Book about Ancient Egypt in the Library the symbols within will need to be noted down
Do not open the outer door to let the vampire from outside in
Open the door to the secret room by using all of the books
One book opens the secret room another opens the trapdoor which will not kill you
The secret room contains a nonlethal ghost but also a Crystal Egg that should be collected
The Crystal Egg can capture the Light of the Pharaohs within it
Go into the Kitchen speak to the Chef about his bizarre recipes which will eventually make him show you the Burgers
Go back to the Rat who you can now talk to about Burgers
Pick up Gore's Pet Rat who is now keen to come with you and find the Burgers
Use the Rat on the kitchen worktop the chef will try and kill him
After the mayhem that ensues collect the Burgers and the blue and white Jug to collect the Local Brew in
Head out into the garden
Collect the Imp
Use the Mapstone
This Mapstone can now transport you to any other Mapstone you have previously found and used i e like the one in the village
To get the Local Brew you should already have at least the Lamp and the Jug
Go to the Darkwoods to the crossroads and straight across
Enter the Darkwoods with the Lamp in your hand or you will be killed in the darkness
Find the Mapstone before crossing the bridge and use it
Cross the bridge which will collapse under your weight
Find the Evil Tree which has red eyes and an axe in its mouth
Send an Imp to collect the Axe if you don't have an Imp there is at least one in the woods to collect
After the Imp has tried and died collect the Axe yourself from the Imp's outstretched hand
Enter the Evil Shack and in the Kitchen collect the Vacuum Cleaner
Outside the shack is a shed
Use an Imp and the axe combined in you inventory to produce an Axe Imp
Use the Axe Imp to cut down the door
Collect the Dinghy from inside to be used to get across the swamp
To get back to the Library cross the ravine which used to have a bridge by finding the Happy Tree it is singing
Use an imp and the Axe combined in your inventory to produce an Axe Imp again and cut down the tree
Walk across the felled tree
Find the Mapstone in the Darkwoods and use it to transport you to Uncle's Garden
From there find the Library and the book activated secret room
Use the Vacuum Cleaner to suck up the Ghost
Collect the Mask that drops to the floor
Find the Phantom of the Opera playing the organ in the main hall
Give him the Mask
Whereas he was scared to leave the house before because he was so ugly he will now happily be collected
Collect the Phantom of the Opera
Go back to the pub using the Mapstones is the quickest way
Use the Phantom of the Opera on stage
He will now entertain and distract the crowds who were previously missing the sounds of the jukebox
With the landlady distracted you can now get down into the pub cellar
Here collect the Weedkiller and use the Jug on the tap to collect the Local Brew
Take this back the basement laboratory in Uncle's house and use it on the pot
One ingredient of four is done
To get the Illuminous Fungus located underneath the Evil Shack in the Darkwoods you will require the Blowtorch Zombie Gun and Gas Mask
You already have the Axe and Weedkiller
Use an Axe Imp to smash and collect the Zombie Gun from the corridor in Uncle's house
The Blowtorch is guarded by the Killer Plant in the Greenhouse in Uncle's Garden
In your inventory combine an Imp with the Weedkiller to produce a Weedkiller Imp
Send the Weedkiller Imp to his death poisoning the Killer Plant in the process
You can now get the Blowtorch vital for opening chained entrances
While you are in the greenhouse note the Seeds that are high on a shelf near the door
The Gas Mask is the Graveyard
Make a Blowtorch Imp in the inventory and use it to open the gate to the graveyard
The skeletons in the graveyard are red herrings
Avoid them
There is a Mapstone just inside the entrance
Use it to enable its use with the other Mapstones
Collect the Flute from one of the statues
Collect the Gas Mask from the stairwell of the Crypt the shed like building at the far side of the graveyard
Use the Mapstones to get back to the Darkwoods and eventually the Evil Shack
In the inventory produce a Blowtorch Imp to open the trap door
Go down into the Cellar Get your Zombie Gun ready in hand
You will need it here
Negotiate the Maze
The Zombie Gun can only shoot one shot at a time thus any location you find with two zombies visible should be exited
Feel free to shoot any Zombies where only one exists in a location
Eventually you will see a hole in the wall
Go though this into the Mushroom Cave
Get your Gas Mask on hand and walk through and take a chunk of Illuminous Fungus
Head back out of the cave and again get your Zombie Gun ready
If you haven't already you must shoot the zombie under the stairs or you will not be able to escape
Leave the Mushroom Cave and take the first right then first left then first right
Here you should see a zombie cowering under the stairs
Shoot him
Take the exit on your left left again and then renegotiate the maze out and back to Uncle's house
Put the Illuminous Fungus in the pot
Just two more ingredients to go to get the Vampire's Teeth
The Vampire will take out his teeth when he is asleep in his crypt but currently he's hovering outside the Library
You will need the Car Keys and Garlic Pizza
You already have the Glass of Water
Go back to the crossroads and Talk to the man in the gibbet cage
Eventually through the correct conversations provided you have spoken to the Policemen already you will strike a deal and receive the Car Keys
These will allow you to get in and drive the Car to the Gates Motel and too fast for the Werewolf to catch you
At the Gates Motel in black and white so do not adjust your monitor head up towards the front door
Go past it to the statue round the side
Use an Imp on the statue which will break the window ready for your escape from Jason's Bedroom
Enter the hotel
There are three cases for you to hide in and a desk and bell
Ringing the bell will cause the Bell Boy monkey to collect a case and take it to a room
Use ring the bell and move get into the third rightmost suitcase
You will exit the case to find yourself in Jason's bedroom
Jason is the guy with the chainsaw who is on his way back to his room
Take the Garlic Pizza in the room and then run back to the car via the broken bathroom window
Jason is behind you all the way
When in the car use the keys still in the ignition
The car will eventually start and take you back to the graveyard
Go to the Library
Open the outer door and let in the Vampire
Use the Garlic Pizza on the Vampire sending him back to his crypt
Get back to the crypt and put the Glass of Water on the table beside the coffin
The vampire will then take out his Vampire Teeth
Take them and put them in the pot in Uncle's Basement Laboratory
The Light of the Pharaohs is located in Ancient Egypt located at the far side of the swamp
You already have everything you need two Imps Dinghy Crystal Egg Burgers and Flute and you should have noted the symbols four groups of three and a final picture in the Egypt book from the Library
Use the Dinghy on the swamp the last exit of the crossroads opposite the village
Get in and move forward the music and timer will start
The swamp is a maze and if you don't get to other side quickly enough the Swamp Monster will get you
Think of each location as having six possible exits rather than the standard four and map it likewise as you try
On the other side of the swamp is a Mapstone
Use it and you will never need to cross the swamp again
Pass through the time warp into Ancient Egypt
Head straight towards the Pyramid
Deviating from this route to explore will almost certainly end in your death
In the snake room create a Flute Imp to keep the snakes distracted
The next puzzle room the Snap Puzzle Room will close the doors after you
You are required to match the symbol that appears above the door with the symbols from the book
As each symbol appears click on one wheel on the left and one on the right hoping for the match
If you complete this puzzle which relies on the clarity of the notes you took from the Library you will move on
To pass though the Mummy Room make a Fat Imp Imp plus Burgers and place him on the sarcophagus ahead
The Mummy inside will not be able to escape as you pass
Enter the Fountain of the Pharaohs
Walk around the outside edge to turn the mirrors to the correct configuration as depicted again in the book
Go to the center well
Look around to check that the mirror formation is correct
If so turn the wheel for the well
If the configuration is correct the Light of the Pharaohs will appear
Collect this in the Crystal Egg and head back to the underground Laboratory in Uncle's House
This is the last ingredient
When added to the others in the pot the Pot will be ready to take
Use the Pot on Gore the monster guarding the stairs who will turn back into Gore and go look for his pet rat
You can now get up the stairs to Level
I would say congratulations but you had this walkthrough which solved all the puzzles for you Level The key to this level is to collect the Brains and plug them into the Brain Machine for transference into the Frankenstein Monster
More Imps can be found in Uncle's Garden
There are three Brains to be found around the upstairs levels the Scientist Brain the Madman Brain and the Elvis Brain
As you collect each of these you use them on the jars in the Brain Machine
Once in situ in the machine a number will light up on the Brain Machine
Using pressing the numbered buttons will transfer the specific Brain into the monster
One Brain is already in the attic laboratory
Pick it up
Use it put it in the pot on the machine
To get the second Brain from the Butler you are required to have the Black Tie
The Black Tie is in the bedroom where your cousin is sitting in a chair
It is on the other side of the room in the drawers so you must go past him
It is best to do this when he is not a Werewolf so make a run for it when the moon in the window is covered by cloud
When you get the Black Tie go back and see the Butler
He will now be more than happy to serve you
To get the third Brain from the Scarecrow you are required to have the Pumpkin
Go to the Torture Chamber and talk to the stretched man the one from the gibbet
and encourage him to leave
When he does put an Imp in the torture device rack instead and encourage the Torturer to stretch the Imp
When he does turn the rack once get collect the Stretched Imp
The Stretched Imp will now be able to collect the Seeds from the high shelf in the Greenhouse
Go down to Uncle's Garden and into the Greenhouse
Collect the Seeds and use them on the Growbag beneath
The Pumpkin will grow
When it is big enough get collect it
Go back up to the First Floor in Uncle's House and find the character with the bag for a head
He will gladly swap the Pumpkin for the Brain in the bag
When you have collected all three Brains use them on the machine put them in the available jars
To open the portal use the Scientist Brain in the machine press
The Scientist monster will then open the portal back to Big D's home dimension
When opened Big D will arrive on the scene
Quickly transfer the Madman Brain to the monster press
on the machine
The Madman monster will send Big D back to his home dimension
Thus with Big D sent back to his home dimension the Level is complete
So a big well done is in order for following these instructions correctly Level You are now in a theme park
Don't ask how
The theme park is divided into three sections separated by a cave a south side where you are initially standing containing the entrance a north side containing the roller coaster and one armed bandit and an east side containing Big D's castle
You will not be able to get into the castle until you have the Entrance Ticket
To get the Entrance Ticket you will need to win it at the Duck Shoot stall
To win you will need the Machine Gun
To get more Imps for saving the game and for solving puzzles you must use the One Armed Bandit located at north side of the theme park
Playing the game is free but depending on your luck and skill it will kill you almost as many times as you win
The method is to get two or three Imps without dying then use an Imp to save and do the same again until you have a good store of them
You now have many Imps
From the One Armed Bandit you will also win Tokens for the Grabber Machine just over the fence to you
After a number of attempts
you will get win the Magnet from the Grabber Machine
Go into the Cave and get steal the Camera from the Demon family
Go to the Comedy Photo Cutouts and use an Imp
The Imp will pose and you should take his picture use the Camera
This will blind the Imp
Collect the Blind Imp
Turn to your left towards the Wall of Death Motorcycle Show
Put your Blind Imp in through the door a normal Imp would refuse
This will cause the motorcycle inside to crash
This in turn will cause the Motorcycle Helmet to be thrown out onto a post
Collect the Motorcycle Helmet
Finally collect the Glue just hanging around outside the Wall of Death
The only other item in this north side that we haven't mentioned is the broken roller coaster
To fix the broken roller coaster you will require the Toolbox Balloon and Imp to make a Floating Toolbox Imp
You also need another Balloon and the Magnet which you already have to solve the puzzle
We will come back later when we have these
Head back to the south side of the theme park
Get a Balloon from the clown
Enter the Funhouse be careful it is a dangerous place
The only object you need to retrieve from the Funhouse is the Spanner
The Spanner is found within one of the mirrors in the Hall of Mirrors
Once collected get out of the Funhouse as fast as possible like you need telling twice
You now have the Spanner and Motorcycle Helmet
Find the Spinning Ride
Get on it when it stops
Make a Spanner Imp Spanner plus Imp and use it on the central bolt which holds the planes
If you have the Crash Helmet which you do the resulting crash will not be fatal
Well not to you
It will however be fatal to the Punch and Judy Stall which previously blocked your path
Go around the side of the Ghost Train and get the Mat if you like it's actually a red herring
Enter the Ghost Train ride it through and watch for the clues
Note the Noose plus pop up Nosferato
Note the Witch plus Circular Saw
Note the Toolbox on the other side of the bars
You will need Glue and an Imp
Make a Gluey Imp and put him in a Ghost Train Car
The Ghost Train will now run on auto and you can follow the car around as it opens heavy doors for you being careful not to be killed by the car as it comes around the track again
Find the Pop up Nosferato the next location further on that the noose and wait
When the car comes around again the Pop up mechanism will propel you through the air
The resulting Noose mechanism will open the Portcullis
Go through this newly opened passage and collect the Toolbox
Note the locked door nearby
Get back to the track waiting for the car to go past first and follow it
When you are almost out at the skeletons you will be near the drop down Witch
She will be dropped when the car approaches again you will have to click on her
No other location is safe from being either being run down or sawed in half
When you get off the Witch the doors will still be swinging so you can quickly escape out
All this for the Toolbox
Use the Toolbox Imp and Balloon to make a Floating Carpenter Imp
Go back to the roller coaster at the base by the breakage in the track
Use your Floating Carpenter Imp here
He will not be able to fly high enough to fix the breakage
Go back to the Balloon Clown
Ask for another Balloon he would be annoyed if you already had one
Use the Balloon on the Floating Carpenter Imp
The extra Balloon will give the Imp the necessary lift to fix the broken track
With the track fixed you can ride the roller coaster
Use the Magnet at the top to get attract the Keys from the Handyman
When the ride ends go back to the ghost train
Getting around the Ghost Train the same way as before use the Keys to unlock the locked door
Inside this room get the Machine Gun
Take the Machine Gun to the Duck Shoot
Win the Ticket
Enter the Castle
Inside the Castle you will meet Big D again and he will kill you
Now playing as the Elvis Monster you must defeat all of the monsters thrown at you by clicking on them
Unfortunately you are on you own here for this arcade section
Hints You normally have some time while skeletons get up on the outer ledge before attacking
Use this time to click on the wheels
Watch for a sequence the attacks are not random
If you climb up the last ladder after the birds the game will finally end
You win
And you did it all yourself
