PASEO DEL MAR HIGH SCHOOL From the outside view of the school move your mouse cursor to the far right side of the building and click on the windows Use the box cutters on the rd window pane of the left most window Enter the Teacher's Lounge
TEACHER'S LOUNGE Inside the lounge be sure to log onto the computer and click on the KEY on the right side Note the codes for various rooms but pay particular attention to the MAINTENANCE room Also click on other options and explore the school mainframe computer Afterwards be sure you look in the file cabinets There's no way to enter the refrigerator to get anything to munch on during your 'break' so don't bother trying LOL Exit the Teacher's Lounge via the window again and return to the main school building Talk to Hal Tanaka about what you discovered in the file cabinet Talk to Connie and Hulk while you're in the building Return to each again to exhaust all possible leads You might wish to contact your friends again on the telephone Now it's time to head for the Maintenance Room door
MAINTENANCE ROOM On the door at the end of the hallway to the right of the sign that points to the Student Union and Study Dome is a Brail keypad You should know the letters represented by Brail based on the Brail book in the Library You should also know the code for the door as you discovered this information in the Teacher's Lounge on the mainframe computer Enter the appropriate code in Brail Enter the Maintenance room and go down the elevator Inside the toolbox are a pair of gloves Pick those up Next note the directions for the Boiler on the wall Notice that you cannot move the levers on top of the Boiler you will later and in a REAL hurry

This walkthrough will be updated frequently This document may be freely distributed by any means as long as the context is not altered in any way and reference links are provided to this site To GAME BOOMERS hints cheats and walkthroughs
GameBoomers Walkthrough by Tally Ho At the beginning we are given the choice of difficulty level Junior Senior or Master
We are playing as Senior Detective
After a brief cutscene including a letter to Dad and a description of a murder that happened yesterday at a local school we begin the investigation at Aunt Eloise's house
Straight ahead on the hall table is a note from her
We find out we need to open the safe to get the key to the school library
Look in the right hand drawer and get the phone card
Go into the living room
At the left end of the sofa you can see a couple of photos
Little Nancy maybe
On the coffee table is an inlaid box with sewing supplies
Nothing to do here
There are some books on the table at the left end of the two cushion sofa
Inside you see some flowers labeled Miniature Iris Tulip Crocus Hyacinth
The highlighted initials spell a name Mitch
Notice the title of one of the books is quot Hidden Clues are Everywhere quot It's true
The drawer in the end table at the right of the three cushion sofa yields three items a brief note about the book sale and bulletin boards the TV remote which you can take and an invitation to the Sigma Phi Kappa Delta sorority reunion
Notice the Greek lower case letters at the top
Turn right and examine the books on the right
The hollow book contains a key you can take
The center section has a TV and VCR it says don'tcha love it
Nothing is playing now if you try turning it on with the remote however
Look right and see the chest on the floor
Your key will open it and you find a quarter you can take
Big deal a quarter right
Well I wish I had that particular quarter
No matter how many times you spend it it just keeps on working
Not bad eh
Just remember the Wrigley Building in Chicago was built on the profits from nickel packs of gum
Okay back to work Detective Drew
Into the hallway and click on the tapestry
In the close up view click on it again and the safe is revealed
Oh no
It's in Greek
Say didn't we just see some Greek letters
They looked like this It's a little unusual to see lower case Greek letters I would expect them to look like this SFKD but it's all in the nature of puzzles I guess
They do have to be pressed in sequence
The door opens and you find the library key hanging there as promised
Look at the wooden box
Eeek
it's a slider puzzle
Stop whining now and go do some studying at this site Slider Puzzle Help Do it
it's worth a little study because you will find all sliders easier to solve if you know how
Isn't that fun
O Wise Elder is an anagram of Eloise Drew
It's almost time to check out the school
Exit the house via the door directly behind you not the pocket door that probably goes to the dining room
Click on the diner and talk with Daryl Gray
To save some disk changing let's poke around the diner a while
Daryl doesn't mind
If you turn way around to the right past the pinballs and jukebox there is a menu on the table
Open it and see the lettersD A N G E Rhighlighted
There are also purple letters highlighted but they are scrambled A T O S B A G Espells sabotage
Put a quarter in the jukebox and see the fun titles Manatee Unchained or Wake up Little Nancy for example
You can click on about half of the titles and play them
werdycan is nancydrew spelled backwards
You can also stick a quarter in the pinball machine and get some sound effects but not real play
On the wall behind the counter is the menu board
Look at it and see the red letters that spell outSOUP LADLEon one side andBOLT CUTTERon the other
Go into the kitchen
Slightly to the right is a cutting board with tomatoes
Look closely between the tomatoes and the knife handle
Someone carved a message there quot Watch Out quot Look down between the table and the gas range and see some bolt cutters
Take them
Uh oh
The gas is leaking and you can't put the cutters back
You need something to prop up the gas line before we all explode
Don't panic it won't explode unless you try to go out the door
Look in the black dishpan under the quot Clean up Spills quot sign and take the large soup ladle
It fits nicely under the gas pipe and the danger is averted
You can read the instruction sheet taped to the refrigerator
Is it a clue
I'm not sure
Read the work schedule by going close up twice to see the following encrypted message on the bottom It's a simple code substituting numbers for letters
It says quot Jake's fate happened deliberately gravity was not his worst enemy quot Exit the diner and click on the school and change to disk
Keep the disks handy there is a LOT of swapping in this game
Detectives must be patient
Enter the school
Straight ahead is a display case with a picture of the football team you can examine
Over your left shoulder is another display case containing trophies and a directory of various schoolrooms
Directly left and right are two hallways
Let's take the left one
Before you walk down the hall look at the bulletin board on the right side
It is a very small hotspot and easy to miss
There is a map of the school on the board
Jake's Locker Hulk Hal and Connie Boiler Room entrance
At the next node the cafeteria is straight ahead you can't get there the Library and the Gym are down the hall to the right and Jake's locker is ahead on the left
You can just see the yellow police tape on it
We'll look through it later when we learn the combination to the lock
Examine the bulletin board on the right side to see this note close up Go right towards the library
If you stop at the next node and look over your left shoulder there is a bulletin board with a pink note that says quot In the face of danger Against a killer if you dare A very unlikely couple Could be a helpful pair quot Turn back around and go towards the gym
Again over your left shoulder is another bulletin board
Find the three notes on the lower right that are rotated and mirrored
They say quot Nowhere to turn to Nowhere to hide Let the books in the library Be your answer guide quot quot A symbol of Kanji Worn with great pride Reflects a big secret That someone must hide quot quot He did what it took To make the grade Even if it meant cheating To keep up his charade quot Look at the eye chart
It says quot EKAMLLUOYEVITCETEDSSALCTSRIFENIUNEGAEKATSIMONEKAMNEHTSIHTDAERNACUOYFI quot quot If you can read thisThen make no mistakeA genuine first classDetective you'll make quot Talk to Hulk Sanchez
Ooooh a boy with an attitude
As before you can choose among dialog lines but can't use them all
After you ask him about Jake the conversation ends
Turn right and see the posters to the left of the vending machines
One advertises a Judo school with a phone number JUDO might mean something
Exit into the hallway and find the left turn to the library
When you get to the spot where the student art exhibit lines the walls there is a bulletin board with the following note The entrance to the library is to the left of this board
Let's explore the library a little later
Continue down that same hallway into the Study Dome
Turn left to see Hal Tanaka studying
Talk to him about understanding people's faces being a doctor and Jake
When you are finished look farther to the left and examine the bulletin board
You see this note Turn a little to the left and you are looking into the hallway we came through
Turn farther left to find a second hallway the one with a quot Senior Prom quot banner
Before entering examine the bulletin board
There is a message with distorted letters that reads quot A Crane contestant in a masked disguise won the prize money despite all the lies quot and quot The ultimate hang out in the center of everything is the place you need to go to set up the final sting quot That board is to the left of the entrance to the Student Union
Step forward and turn around to see the bulletin board to the other side of the entrance
There is a notice about the yearbooks
If you pick out the underscored letters they say quot Search below danger sign in kitchen quot We've done that already and found the bolt cutters
Go into the Student Union
Talk with Connie about Hulk Hal and Daryl to get a few tidbits of information
Look at the big bulletin board and examine the red and white poster
The content of the poster doesn't mean anything to us but there is a message buried in the border
It says quot Side of School quot What the heck does that mean
The Teachers Lounge is off the Student Union but the door is locked and we don't have another key
Just to the left of that door is a board with photos of recent Students of the Month
Wonder if Jake is one of them
Probably not the way his reputation is shaping up
Maybe they're part of the Nancy Drew Software development team who knows
To Connie's right is a magazine rack you can look at and some posters above
The one that seems to matter is about the Men's Judo Tournament sponsored by the Crane School of Self Defense
Let's use the phone before we exit the Union
Close up once lets us use the phone book
Uh oh someone tore out the number for the Pharmacy
Close up again then swipe your phone card
Three friends' numbers appear
You have to dial the entire number even though they are local calls
They don't offer much help just to go somewhere where there is lots of information
That would probably be the library
Exit the Lounge
Let's look in all directions here
To the left is the Boiler Room door
The code pad requires knowledge of Braille
Guess we'll find that somewhere
Looking down the hallway there is a scrap of paper on the floor
Hey that's the number to the Pharmacy DRUG
Up and to the right is another bulletin board
The page you can read contains this odd message quot Student files under lock and key will show the lies of a doctor to be quot Hmmm
The only student we have met that might become a doctor is Hal Tanaka
What gives
Lies
That's hard to believe
Let's see what's down this hall
Oh
we're back at the entrance
So it is possible to go full circle since the hallways from both sides meet at the Study Dome
Go straight the way we first went then right and right again to the student art exhibit
Turn around to find the library entrance
Use Aunt Eloise's key to get into the library
Straight ahead is the desk where you find a stack of blue forms
There are words highlighted on them that tell you quot Sabotage should cause concern but with the gloves you will not burn quot Back away from the close up and look right
Move forward to this view I can see quot DINER MURDER HULK CRANE BAD DANGER HARM MAY POEM MITCH NAME JUDO CONNIE MAXINES TASK BOILER VIDEOTAPE JAKE DARYL HAL quot If you think they go in some kind of order that's up to you
The lower one has a map with a puzzle hidden under it that gives a message
Read the blue letters first then the green
It says quot The bolt cutter you must take Or you could be the next Jake quot We've done that so should be okay
Check the card catalogue
Hmmm
Someone was looking for English Essays
Check the bookcase
The upper left white and green books do not contain one you can read
The upper center one has a book on fingerprints
The lower center one red has a book on Braille
Check the colored letters
The following letters are color coded A C D G H I M N O P R S T U
If you sort them out by color and rearrange them you can spell quot Mitch drops a gun quot IMPORTANT gt gt The upper left red and white shelf has a book on Kanji characters
The lower left green books have one on Morse code
Again there are colored letters A C D E F I N P R T V If you sort them you can spell quot Find VCR Tape quot Turn left and step towards the stairs
You find yourself on the first landing looking at this plaque Actually if you check those numbers against your phone buttons you can make them spell the word quot Note quot Perhaps that means something
Let's go up the left stairway to the second level
Head into the stacks and find the following books quot The Judo Handbook quot which describes the Crane style of fighting quot Boiler Operations quot which gives some info on the safe operations of boilers quot Dictionary of Handwriting Analysis quot and quot A Sign of the Times quot depicting the numerals and alphabet used in American Sign Language
See the color coding here and you can pick out A E J K
quot Jake quot and some numbers might provide the answer to something
Don't you just love some of the other titles especially on the shelf where the boiler book is
quot Programming your VCR in easy steps quot right next to quot Quantum Physics for Novices quot and down the line quot Diners to Die For quot Funny stuff
Okay make your way around the other side to the table and chairs
Look close up at the table and you see a yellow notepad with the following message on it GSV LMV DRGS GSV GVNKVIZMW GSV RILM URHG RH NLIV GSZM Z KIRNV HFHKVXGLM QZPVH YOZXPNZRO ORHG
Now any Master Detective I've ever met will know how to solve this little gem
It's a substitution code and an easy one at that
The clue to solving it is right at the top of the page quot The first shall be the last quot The alphabet has just been reversed so that Z A Y B and so on
Translated it reads quot The one with the temper and the Iron Fist is more than a prime suspect on Jake's blackmail list quot What's an Iron Fist
A pistol maybe
Look at that phone number
It says quot C S S D
quot Isn't that the same number from the Judo poster near the gym
And who are C W and D G
Could be Daryl Gray wonder whom he's seeing
Does C W
stand for Connie Watson
Funny they hardly admit to knowing eacn other
Continue around past the study carrels and down the stairs
At the bottom go right toward the Fiction section
You will find books on Palmistry Optical Illusions Violence Protecting the Manatees The Zodiac and way in the back a book on the meaning of dream symbols
Color coded letters spell quot Don't Run Nancy quot Exit the library and talk with Hulk Sanchez
You find out that Jake and Hal had something going on and their lockers were adjacent
Talk with Hal and you learn that Hulk was injured recently
Also that Daryl's father was a senator but his company went bankrupt a few years ago
But Previously Connie told us Daryl drives a Porsche
What's going on here
Talk to Connie
You don't get much out of her
Try the phone
The drug company is temporarily closed due to a depletion of supplies
How odd
For some fun Tony's Pizza will answer saying quot Heyy
Dis is Tony's a Pizza
Leave a you message quot Cute
Also try the number on Eloise's card and hear her trying to set up the answering machine
Funny
And if you have the number for the Police Yablonski answers and says quot Nancy quit playing with that phone and get back to work
We have a murder to solve
quot Let's go find Jake's locker and see if we can get into it
What was that about Jake's locker combination and the Phone
Let's see


j a k e on the phone comes out
Maybe our experience playing Safecracker will come in handy after all
Aha
Let's snoop
On the top shelf is a Judo magazine
In it appears an article about the mysterious masked contestant who won first prize
Who was he
Next to the magazine is a book of English Essays
Remember the card catalogue
This is the book referred to on the card
Next to the book is an empty video tape box
Looking in the lower part of the locker we find a box knife on the floor and a newspaper article about a recent break in at the Pharmacy where some Dianabol was stolen
Take the knife with you
Click on the school building to approach it and look for the hotspot on the far right side of the building
It's not a very big spot
just to the right of the lower right window
Remember the clue where it said quot Side of School quot The window has one pane that looks like a different kind of glass
Plexiglas maybe
Use the box knife to make a hole you can reach through and release the window
Hop into the lounge
There is one book in the bookcase you can open
In it is a note with a partial message in sign language
It says quot


o was innocent


quot Below it are some colored circles
Put the red colored letters in the red spots and the black colored letters in the black slots
These two words I assume replace the quot o quot
The message now reads quot Connie Watson was innocent quot which can be translated into she didn't kill Jake
Thanks to Trekkie for helping solve this one
Look at the map next to the file cabinet
Across the top and bottom you can read quot A trophy was not the only prize but also money of a greater size quot Hmmm
Someone won a trophy and a cash prize
For Judo maybe
And the sides of the map say C W C W


Connie Watson maybe
Was she the masked winner
She is a toughie
In the file cabinet is a folder containing Hal's senior essay
Uh oh
It looks like Hal copied it right out of that book of English Essays
Next to the computer you can find a memo by the telephone
It says quot B U C D N M E X M N D L F R quot I read this as quot Before you see the enemy examine the elevator quot Wake up the computer by clicking on either the keyboard or the mouse
How considerate for those people who don't like keyboards
Type in 'eloise drew' and press enter and o wise elder enter again to get logged on
For help click on the question mark
In the file cabinet notice the librarian is aware of the missing book
In the maintenance part notice the need to fix the lock on the video lab and to change the password to the boiler room
In the security section notice the password for the maintenance room quot NOTE quot Click on the printer icon to get a document
Go to the printer to see what came out
At an exchange student came to get his homework
Hal maybe
At two individuals observed in the video lab
Is the redhead Jake
On the bottom of the page is a form number BR LL K YP if you substitute letters for the numbers it reads quot Braille Keypad quot Above the printer is a Periodic Table of Chemical Elements
Several elements are highlighted There are three different colors
Read the red ones backwards to spellsearch then the blue to spellbehind and the green letters makeboiler This clue helps when you get stuck in the boiler room
Thanks again Trekkie
Can you hear the Morse Code in the background
I can do Morse Code sort of but it has to be really slow
If there is a clue or message in the code of course there is I can't get that one either
Maybe someone can help with these two clues
It's optional but a good idea to go into the boiler room at this time
Into the front entrance of the school and go right and right again
You know the entry code now
Press the buttons in this order I know it's a pain but change to disk
Down the elevator and explore
On the wall is a diagram of the correct Power Pressure and Temperature settings
Make a note or a diagram
You will need this information later
Take the gloves out of the tool box on the floor
Also look around the left of the boiler
There is a ladder you can't go down and a plaque on the wall with the number
Is it a date or a clue
Go back upstairs
Okay let's go face Hal about that essay
Ask him about the other students first
Then aboutcheating The truth comes out
He was desperate for time and copied the essay
When Jake found out he blackmailed Hal into doing all Jake's homework
Be sure you ask him aboutHulk's injury
You can ask all three students about the video camera in Jake's locker but it's not essential
Talk to Hulk
Ask him about the other students first then aboutbreak in at the Drug Depot He's getting cranky too
Talk to Connie
Ask her about the other students
Ask her last about theCrane Medallion
Time to go to the Diner and visit with Daryl again
You must get the note because it is the trigger for the sabotage in the boiler room
Return to the school go into the boiler room and discover that someone has adjusted the controls to a dangerous level and chained them in place
The boiler is overheating and could explode
Use the bolt cutters to remove the chain and reset the power pressure and temperature to the correct values
The center one is good leave it alone
Pull the left lever twice the right one twice and the left one once more
The boiler cools down
Turn around and find the matchbook with a phone number inside
You recognize it as the pharmacy's number
Whoever sabotaged the boiler was probably connected with all the skullduggery
Exit the boiler room through the grate to the right of the boiler since the button to the lift has been smashed
Take the video cassette and exit
We need to watch that tape
Where was that VCR
Oh yeah Eloise's house
Let's go there
My Jake was a busy one
He has hard evidence on everybody
Hulk stealing drugs Connie posing as a boy Hal copying his prize essay and what's this
Our little Daryl selling stuff to some sleaze trying to get lung cancer
That must be the mysterious Mitch
I think we better talk with Daryl some more
If there is a sign on the door he's not at the diner just now
Let's try our friends at the school
Talk with Connie and Hulk about being blackmailed
Go back to the diner and talk with Daryl
He realizes he is in trouble and agrees to help you later in the evening
Back to the school and try to get the other kids to help
No one wants to get involved
Be sure andtell Connie that Daryl is in danger
Exit and it is nighttime
Check the Diner and it is closed
Go to the Pharmacy
You see Daryl and Mitch arguing
Mitch pulls his gun and Connie jumps in to save the day
The gun is knocked from Mitch's grip and you can pick it up
It sshows up in your inventory
Hold it in your hand and be ready to aim it at Mitch don't forget to click it doesn't fire the gun but makes Mitch aware of it
You have a very short time
If you are late it's Bye Bye Nancy
If you get his attention in time he surrenders and all's well that ends well

When you knock on the door it will open slightly
It is a good time to save your game
Go inside and disarm the bomb To disarm the bomb use the screwdriver from the work bench in the studio on the four screws of the tape recorder
You may want to save your game immediately after removing the screws
Quickly use the wire cutter on the wires just above the TIMER CLOCK on the bomb You need to clip the wires slightly to the left of the wire you want to cut See picture below of the placement for the wire cutters when cutting the YELLOW wire Clip the wires in the following order YELLOW RED ORANGE and BLUE

You will never be able to hear this cassette clearly but that is not important The important things you must do in the Control room is to turn on the power and pick up the security video
Leave the Control Room and go down to the far side past the stage area where you see some comfortable chairs and coffee cups You will see a locked panel on the wall which you can open with the key you got from the clock Move the gears as the diagram shows
Maneuver the levers to match the diagram and push the button above the levers to activate the trap door Move the levers in the following way Move the top lever to the right one time Move the middle lever to the right one time

Get the wallet out of the coat pocket and look at the calling card
Use those numbers to open the briefcase
Look at everything in his briefcase
Use the key in the briefcase to open the file drawers Inside the Filing cabinet look carefully at Rick's Personal File and that of Mattie's and Owen Spayder's Note her SKILLS fire arms etc
Also read the LEMARRON book on the bookshelf
This provides valuable information and clues to the coded messages
Notice also the piece of paper in the RIGHT drawer of Dwayne's desk
You will see a diagram drawn of the BOMB timer and the wires numbered in the lower right corner of that paper
Additionally you will find a few useful telephone numbers for the WWB Cast and Directors
Look in Dwayne's top middle drawer for the adhesive wonder what he might have used that for
Look underneath the chess board on the small table
Return to Mattie's Apartment Watch the Security Video that you picked up from the Control Room It has the red label

SAVE YOUR GAME here
STUDIO Final Climax Talk to Lillian and exhaust all topics of conversation
Ask particularly or suggest that the culprit is Dwayne Powers Save your game right after talking with Lillian
The lights will go off and Dwayne will appear in the Control Room window up above
After talking with Dwayne he will tell you that he is coming down to rid the Studio of Lillian and YOU
When you regain control of Nancy Drew's movements turn immediately to the right and move forward towards the Fire Alarm
Pull the alarm and then back up two times
Immediately click on the Vacuum Door release button just to the left of the doors that lead out of the Studio
Once you have pushed the button to release the Studio doors a small panel opens see graphic EndGameCodes revealing the Final Puzzle of the game
Remember that your time is very limited on this puzzle before Dwayne finishes you off Don't wait
Immediately click on one of the buttons
IF you have pushed theWRONGbutton you will not see a change in the panel
IF however you have pushed aCORRECTbutton a white triangle appears in the center in the black ball
Now push another button
If the white triangle disappears push the FIRSTcorrectbutton again to re light the white triangle and try another button
The idea is to quickly enter the code so that with each button you push a white triangle appears in the center of the black ball
You must correctly push the buttons in the proper order
Any wrong button and ALL the white triangular lights will disappear causing you to start all over again
If you do NOT finish the puzzle before your time is up use the SECOND CHANCE option from the game menu
Be FOREWARNED however that each time you use the SECOND CHANCE option the button sequence will CHANGE
When you have completed the puzzle the sequence will appear to be the same as if you'd done it incorrectly but the Security Guard will enter through a side door and nab Dwayne If you need more time to finish this puzzle please email me and I will send you some files Norma Now sit back and enjoy the final sequence of events as Nancy writes another letter to Bess You've solved the mystery and Life goes on at the WWB Studios

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
WorldWide Broadcasting HeadquartersBefore you talk to the security guard check out a couple of magazines sitting around on the tables
Uh oh it looks like someone's been snipping out letters to create those nasty notes
Better be careful
See the guard and sign for your visitor's pass
On your way into the studio have a look at the portrait of the WWB founder Mildred Strathorn
Straight inside the door is the recording studio
The On Air light is lit so we can't get in there yet
Read the instructions about the vacuum seal doors
Go left to the end of the corridor overhearing the Producer Bill Pappas grumbling
Go right and knock on Mattie's dressing room
Talk with her until she has to go work
Look at the table next to the chair where she was sitting
You find an amorous note in French
Somebody who speaks French cares a lot about Mattie it seems My Sweetheart Here is a symbol of my love for you
You are an angel sent from heaven to guide me and to give me hope
I love you and send you hugs and kisses
Here is a symbol of my love for you
You are an angel sent from heaven to guide me and to give me hope
I love you and send you hugs and kisses
Underneath that table is a newspaper suggesting that the ratings will drop if Rick leaves the show
The Producer didn't sound too thrilled about that either
Check out the vanity to see what color lipstick Mattie likes
It looks a little mashed
Look on the top of the mini fridge and open the letter to see the hidden word puzzle Some of the clues read in reverse and some are vertical
You can look at the other dressing table and cosmetic chest but there is nothing to do there
Go to the other side of the room where the large chest of drawers is and see the can letter on top and the medallion in the jewelry box that is inscribed around the edge A mask of sweet sincerity A cloak of loving kindness Meant to sway the heart to trust And fill the eyes with blindness
Then look in the other box to find a torn note
It is not a slider more of a jigsaw
Rotate the pieces by placing the cursor at the upper right corner of a piece so they are all right side up then re order them to re assemble the note
When you get it right it snaps together
Maybe it'sfromMattie or maybe it'stoMattie we can't tell yet
Talk to Rick about everything
He's got a bit of an ego but hey he is an actor after all
The Sound StageWhen you are done here go to the sound stage and use your visitor's pass to enter
You will see a cutscene where Rory Rick is almost crushed by a falling Klieg light
It appears someone rigged it to fall but the blocking position of the actors was not just right or maybe itwasjust right in order to come close and still miss
Everybody leaves and you can have a look around
Go onstage and turn around toward the entrance to see the teleprompter
An evil message from someone who must have access to the studio's equipment
There are several close up views available such as the side rooms the music the teacups and the clock
The clock is missing a hand
If you examine the carpet next to the sofa it seems there is a trap door concealed there
If you try the spiral stairs the door to the control room is locked
You must search for the code
Between the spiral stairs and the entrance is a crate with a packing slip on top
At the upper right you see a bunch of numbers
Nancy Drew has been around and she knows enough to prepare an alphabet decoder such as this one
It decodes numeric codes and reversed alphabet messages ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA Taking those numbers from the packing slip yields this message ESCAPEHARMSOUNDALARMOn the other side of the room is a refreshment area with a dry erase board on the wall
Looks like they plan things very accurately
Looking to the right you can see a blackboard where the lighting director has detailed his her plans
There is also a wheel that operates the catwalk it is stuck and a flat cabinet which needs a key you don't have
Step back toward the entrance then turn right and go toward the workshop area IMPORTANT Approach the workbench and take a screwdriver Back at the entrance you can see that the On Air sign is turned off there is a vacuum door seal override and a fire alarm
Don't get cute and pull that fire alarm unless you want a security guard to appear
If you don't have a good reason to sound the alarm it's Game Over toots
Okay go back and talk to Mattie
She is upset
Talk to Rick about the chocolates truth and the letters
He leaves and you can poke around his room
Look on the green sofa
There is a box or Sorpresa Chocolates and behind it a loath note based on a famous poem by Janes Joyce
Someone has changed the wording
On top of the stereo is a broken watch and a note made from cut out letters
Your Time is Running Out sort of like the message on the teleprompter
Check out the vanity to see he really has an ego then look on the top of the nini fridge
There are three thing there two more cut out notes signed this time by B T Kaisuur and most important a photo with a very jealous note
Is it written in lipstick
Look in the drawer
In the front is a photo to look at and in the rear is a pair of D glasses
Take them
To the right is the sink with another cut out note
Turn around and go to the dresser
On top is another note from the same typewriter and a box of roses that apparently just arrived
Open the box
Eeeeww
They're dead
To the left find another note on top and one in the drawer
Looks like she's really able to keep tabs on Rick
All around the room are framed magazine covers attesting to Rick's Rory's popularity
That's all here
Go around the far corridor and knock on the Prop Room
The lady inside is Millie Strathorn
She says you aren't permitted in the prop room unless you are permitted in the prop room
Huh
I think she should send out for some oxygen
Go see the director Lillian Weiss
Miss Congeniality she isn't
She takes away your pass
Can't get far without a pass
Go home and see if Mattie has any suggestions
She comes up with an idea get hired by her agent Dwayne Powers and regain access to the set as an extra
Hollywood here we come
Dwayne Powers AgencyRing the buzzer twice to get in
Sounds like Dwayne doesn't want any surprise visitors
Also he sounds important
Says he provides WWB with nearly all their talent
Ask him about Rick though and his attitude changes for the worse
Return to WWB and talk with Lillian again
Ask her about Dwayne and it seems he isn't exactly at the head ofherlist
Go down the hall to the Prop Room
The Prop RoomAnswer three riddles to be admitted into the Prop Room
They are easy
If you just can't get the answers
have a look atNorma's Walkthrough She lists the answers for all three levels of detective
Turn around and see the bell to the right of the door
It is inscribed The key to a mystery is revealed by the wise when the bell sounds its toll and the moon makes its rise
What's that all about
Something to do with ringing a bell after dark maybe
To the right of the bell are three shelves to look at a box of jewelry an old radio and a gramophone
Turn way around and take a step toward the harp
To the right is a piano Examine the music
Some of the notes are blue
If you play a musical instrument you can read the notes
They are cageabadeggace
Fix that up to read Cage a Bad Egg Ace
Look just to the right of the harp to find a map
Around the edge it says When gates are lockedAnd paths are blocked Then look for other ways The answer lies beneath your feetTo this perplexing maze
Be sure you findthe wire cuttersunder the rightside of the map
Now click on the chest below the harp
A Towers of Hanoi puzzle is revealed
For instructions look close up at the brass plaque
Solve the puzzle and receive the hour hand that belongs to the clock on stage
If you enjoy the Towers of Hanoi you can replay the puzzle for fun
Look left and take a doorknob from the box
You justneverknow when a doorknob will come in handy
In fact it will let you back into the Prop Room at night when Millie takes the master doorknob home with her
Further left are three shelves you can look at
See the gargoyle a birdhouse a diving helmet and in between the clock and a box this crossword puzzle
You can't actually solve it on screen but the words are pretty obvious ACROSS FOUND THREATS TRAP WRATH CLOCK LOCK BROKENDOWN DEATH LOST BEWARE WATCH BOMB CLUE KEY You can blow on the bagpipe just for fun
Further left is a locked cage
To its right are some shelves to examine
Open the mailbox and read the letter to Millie
Straight ahead is a fireman's helmet from the STFD
Cute
On the left of the cage one shelf contains an oil can you can take and a diary
If you looked closely at the map you saw it was a chart of the round the world of M Strathorn in the 's
Here you will find a page from his diary
Neat Stuff
Look at the other shelves then go to the desk IMPORTANT Examine the typewriter and observe that the notes you saw before were created on this very machine
Whoever typed those notes has access to the prop room
While you are at the typewriter
look at the keyboard
Some letters are a different color as if they've been used a lot maybe
E R T I A H K C They can be rearranged to spell HATE RICK
Open the log book on the left side of the desk
Inside the front cover is a page in code
Use the decoder chart above to figure out what it says Many pages come before thisIn the Log Book with a clue But nothing comes after this Unless it's written in the glue
Many pages come before thisIn the Log Book with a clue But nothing comes after this Unless it's written in the glue
Huh
I think Millie's been sniffing the glue
Now look at the page on the other side
You can look at both the top and bottom of the page
It seems some interesting props were signed out for today Friday the thirteenth
Hacksaw mask police tape to name a few
Check the paper sticking out to see a list of missing items
Even more interesting fake beard spirit gum that's for sticking on fake beards D glasses we know where those are and a tape recorder
Somebody's up to something alright Now look at the top right corner of the log book to get a close up view and pick up the corner
Someone has written something there possibly a password
It says Millie WWB
Exit the prop room
My goodness
We were in the Prop Room so long it is after hours and everyone has left
Talk to Mattie before you leave
Exit by way of the Talent Exit around the far corridor past Rick's room and go home
Aunt Eloise's HouseWhen you arrive home there is a package for you from Hanna on the chair next to the phone
Read the note take the videotape and go watch it on the VCR
Then head for the stairs
It's been a long day time for some sleep
Actually change to day that means you are getting up the next day
Go to WWB and knock on Rick's door
It is unlocked and opens slightly
Go in
Uh oh
Someone has written Die Rick on the mirror
And there's that tape recorder that has been missing
It says Play Me
Go ahead and play it
A very distorted message plays something about blowing Rick to smithereens
You better have a look inside the case
Use the screwdriver four times to open up the box revealing a bomb inside
The wire cutters will take care of disarming the bomb provided you cut the wires in the proper order
Sorry I am sure there is a clue to the colors somewhere but I haven't seen it
In real life you cannot afford to experiment because the second chance option doesn't work but in the game it does
If you don't want to be blown up the order is yellow red orange blue
A cutscene takes you home with phone calls from Ned and Mr Pappas the producer
Talk to him about everything
At the end of the call notice a new piece of paper on the desk
It gives you the entry code for the Talent Entrance
There is also a note for you to call George
Talk to her about everything
Switch to night and go to WWB
WorldWide Broadcasting HeadquartersThe front door is closed go around the left side and enter through the Talent Entrance
The code is
At night don't meander around the halls too much
Security personnel are around
Go directly to Lillian's office and check it out
To get in use your actor's pass on the doorknob
Begin searching by turning right toward the TV
There is a lot to do in this room and you should be organized
Look at the clipboard under the TV
The top sheet has some info if it's useful I haven't figured it out and at the second sheet which appears red and scrambled
Those D glasses will come in handy here sorting out the colors so you can see the decoder
Look at the bookshelf
Didn't the list of missing props include a pair of maracas
Hmmm
Over to the desk
The Rolodex is open to a card belonging to Ms Teri Gaime
Could be pronounced Mystery Game
Cute
Look at the fax
See the words in italics
Read them vertically
It says A bitter hoax tainted with hate is a secret revenge from a previous date
Look in the top left drawer and see the bottle of rubber cement
Just the thing I would use to create a ransom style note of cut out letters
While you are right there look in the wastebasket
Uh ohhhh
Do you think Lillian wrote that hate poem
Look up at the bookshelf and open the book on Anger Management
Take the computer disk
Go toward the printer and close up on the date book
he rescheduled yesterday's appointment
Was she too busy doing other things
Who is Moira Cunningham
How could Lillian have time to go to lunch at Chez Pierre on a day they shoot an episode
Did she know the studio would get closed early
That numerical message on the lower left page says Life is Like a Box of Chocolates
Look closely at the notepad next to the in out box
Take the pencil and rub it revealing a phone number for the chocolate company
Make a note
You can look in the container of floppy disks and see what they're about
Lillian was pretty organized that's all
Back away and look at the bulletin board above the computer
Lillian had proposed some changes to the layout of the set
Look in the lower left drawer and find the Castor Oil
Pretty horrid tasting stuff if I recall
Wouldn't do at all to soak someone's chocolates in that would it
Okay let's have a look at the computer
Before you actually log in notice the post it note on the right
It says Thorns and petals of demise are a bitter reflection of one's envy and despise
That wouldn't have anything to do with dead roses would it
Let's log in
We aren't long on passwords here so try the one you found in the prop room Millie wwb
Bravo you're in
Well there's not a whole lot here
The filing cabinet wants an employee I D
number which we don't have the Maintenance folder doesn't tell us very much but it does have some names
More later maybe
The help is just that help
The key oh here's something useful
Entry codes to various areas
The control room's code is actor but the keypad was in funny symbols
Read all the e mail
The floppy drive isn't available
Wait a minute we have a disk let's log out put that disk in the drive and log back on
The plot thickens here is a letter to Rick exposing Lillian's feelings
Like shehasfeelings
Before you check out of the computer print out the document
Go read it
It is a list of incidents involving Rick Arlen
In the StudioGo to the clock and use the hand on one of the numbers
Did it chime
That's probably not what you want
Try the
A reminder of The th Hour maybe
You will have a new key
Go up the spiral stairs and look at the keypad
Remind you of those images on the clipboard decoder
The code word is ACTOR and the letters can be found on the decoder and snipped out to form the symbols on the keypad
So the combination is Go to the back of the control room and open the electric box with the key you just obtained
Turn on the power
Look right to find the audio equalizer
Use the cassette tape that came from Rick's bomb they made you a copy remember
and adjust the controls to hear it better
Try turning the voice Ch
volume down and the other two up one at a time
The background noises suggest that the tape was made nearby
The quality never gets perfect but you can understand the words
Hello Rick
Don't try to leave the room
The doors are locked
Didn't you get my first warning
Somewhere in this room is an explosive device that will blow your body to smithereens


unintelligible Use the Power button to exit the machine
Swing back around to the shelves and pick up the video from Security
Look at the Whiteboard
A faint message says Light reveals what is hidden in the darkness but you must first unlock the power of the light
Optional you can play with the sound effects board at the far end of the room
It's comparable with the jukebox in Secrets Can Kill fun but not much help
Find that corrugated cabinet on the wall by the catwalk control
Unlock it with the same key and turn on the generator
Move the levers thus top once middle once top once bottom all the way to the right
You should hear the generator start
Push the button on the motor to engage the machinery
Go to the stage and find the trap door at the end of the sofa
Now it is open and ready for use
All major stages have elevators in the floor usually big enough for a foot grand piano
Go down find the other end and go up
You are in the Prop Room Cage
Go forward and look at the shirt pocket
Two big things here the name Owen Spayder we saw that in the temp's list in the computer and the I D
number also wanted by the computer
And the shirt sleeve is torn
Must Be Important
Go to the refreshment area and look at the wheel that operates the catwalk ladder
It is stuck would it help to oil it
Yes
Go up the ladder and explore
You will find a piece of material torn from someone's shirt near one of the lights
Looks like Spayder had something to do with the lights
Well he is a stage hand after all
Let's go back to the computer
By the way see if Owen W Spayder is an anagram
Twist the letters around to spell another name

Note Be sure you first put the diskette into the slot on the bottom right side and enter the laptop password

Go talk to Louis in the study You may need to run upstairs and reset the clock here to make sure Louis is in the study when you want him to be
He says its a shame that those papers were lost in the fire Ask Louis about Gum Bo Fu Louis will ask you where you heard about Gum Bo Fu If you tell him you found it in a book you are in trouble But then you always get a Second Chance so go ahead and try it if you like Otherwise choose to tell him that you saw it in a magazine instead Louis will tell you that Gum Bo Fu means House of Great Books
Go talk to Rose in the dining room

Go up to the Chinese room and find the letter from Emily on the chair beside your suitcases
Pick it up and read it Discover that Gum Bo Fu doesn't mean House of Great Books at all Louis lied to you Gum Bo Fu means Gold Treasure Mansion
Wow
Now we are getting somewhere
See that the Hanzi symbol for GOLD is also written on this letter If you are playing in junior mode the first symbol gold will highlight when you place your cursor over it If you are playing in senior mode it will not
Turn and go to the right side of the bed The tapestry on the lower part of the wall is gone as Rose explained Find the hot spot Find that the wooden tiles can be pushed in These are the same little Chinese symbols that you saw in the Zodiac book in Abby's room Push the tiles in in order Find the safe behind the tiles
The combination lock reflects all of the Hanzi symbols that correspond with the highlighted words on the tapestry beside the door Okay then
Here's where that list of words and their equivalent symbols comes in handy
Input the Hanzi symbols in the order of the words as they are shown on the tapestry Press the arrow after each symbol is lined up under the arrow You turn the dial by moving your cursor left or right of the lock until you see a yellow swirled directional arrow
Then click to move the dial on the lock
You will find Lizzie Applegate's and Diego Valdez' marriage certificate Put the gold Hansi symbol you found under the stairway banister on the pyramid box You will be presented with the Flip Puzzle Change all the moons to suns The puzzle is very easy in junior mode In senior mode there are more squares which complicates the puzzle significantly However the solution is as follows where a number is the square to click on It isn't necessary to click the numbers in order just click on the correct squares
XX X XXXXXX X XX Next you will be presented with the bane of most all adventure gamers a dreaded slider puzzle There is no solve for this puzzle either in junior or senior mode The senior slider is much more complex with more tiles than the junior version The way I solved it was to run down to the main hall again and sketch the Phoenix bird painted on the hardwood floor That really expedited the solution
When you have solved the Phoenix slider you will be rewarded with a huge red jewel
Put it in your inventory
It is a missing eyeball from the Phoenix finials on the grand staircase Go to the Chinese room and set the time for p m Then go down and put the red jewel in the appropriate eye socket of the Phoenix finials Then go to the Phoenix symbol on the floor and use your crow bar to remove the floor boards WOW You will get a smack on the head and wake up to see Louis taking the hidden treasure of gold coins from beneath the floorboards
That rotten Louis

Return the boots to Professor Hotchkiss then take the elevator back down to talk with Dexter To return the boots place them in the hall in front of her door As you turn and walk away you will hear her open the door and take the boots
You will get stuck in the elevator and the emergency button doesn't work Turn around and look up for a way out
Jumping across to the metal ladder along the wall is a little risky perhaps you can find another way After you get back to the hall head down the stairs to talk with Dexter and let him know the elevator is broken also He tells you that the lights in the upper spiral staircase are out and asks you to check the circuit breakers Move the top levers on the right as shown in the picture below
To reset the elevator notice the elevator control box on the left side of the circuit breaker box There is a lever to reset the elevator there Pull it down
Go back up the stairs and notice the lights to the upper staircase are on
Ask Dexter about your radiator again He will tell you that you fixed the circuit breakers and then he will give you another errand This time he wants you to run up and ask the professor what she wants for dinner She tells you she would like cous cous When you tell Dexter he says that she needs to order off the menu Bring her the menu and she will order chicken legs When you give Dexter her order he will give you one last errand and that is to tell Jacques to take the bag of chicken legs out of the freezer to defrost Now your radiator will be fixed and you are free to enjoy your vacation Check your watch to see if you have time to meet Jacques in his office If not you can either do some snooping around or go up to your room and set the alarm clock by your bed to a time when the ski rental office will be open Once you relay the message to Jacques about the chicken legs you will find an oil can next to your radiator and it will be fixed On your way you can confront Lisa with what you learned about opening her locker by mistake Ask her about her many identities
Talk to her about the SECRET GARDEN and TOWER ENTRANCE After you have the oil can you can do more snooping
Set your alarm to pm Take the elevator to the basement and climb out You should hear noise that sounds like sawing Nancy will mention something about a strange noise Turn around and look down Nancy will say something about a strange noise coming from down below and that there is something important down there
To get into the Library the st time While you are down in the basement climb up the metal ladder against the wall When you are near the top you will notice a grate that is falling off and an open vent Swing across to the vent and crawl through it until you come to the grate leading into the library Open it and jump down As you start to go down the stairs you will hear the sound of someone coming Quickly turn around and get back into the vents Watch Dexter type in the code for the alarm and search the library When he is gone you are safe to go back in the library
Things to do in the Library Look in the desk and readAn Atlas of the United States Note the longitude of Wisconsin is degrees West
Notice the dust on the top of the desk Use the paint brush on the dust and then use that on the alarm key pad to figure out the code Try it out If it says approved you have it correct
Find the globe and move the needle to the longitude you found in the atlas then click on the top knob to open it
The paper inside has the clue for the compass puzzle found behind the plaque above the fireplace Move the compass to each number and every time you move it click on the green top button When you do this successfully you will hear a creaking squeaky sound as the door to the secret room upstairs opens Before you rush up there take a look at some important books
One is the book on Marie Antoinette lying on the floor written by Professor Hotchkiss The other book you MUST read is the one aboutMarie Antoinette's Famous Portrait that is on the small table to the RIGHT of the spiral stairs that lead up to the Secret Room and or Vent shaft This BOOK is what triggers the close up for the Purple Rose in the Portrait in the Tower
Go up to the secret room pick up the lighter and use it on the candle to get an ornate key Read the letter next to the candle Turn around and read the two books about Dexter one good and one bad You can now leave the library from the main doors without getting caught
Now it is time to see where that noise is coming from beneath the elevator Go to your room and set the alarm for pm Go back to the st floor Library It is easy if you are using the elevators Make sure the elevator is on the st floor and you have the oil can in your inventory
If you don't have the library key you will find it in a drawer on Dexter's desk You will need that too Open the door to the library and the alarm will go off Quickly go forward two steps then turn and head to the alarm Push the buttons and the alarm will go off Go up through the vent and climb down the ladder to the bottom of the elevator shaft You will hear strange sounds from below
Turn around and find the lever that is stuck Use the oil can on the lever and open that grill Go down the stairs and turn left toward a door with six sliding locks The combination will change each time you want to open this door Follow the hall around to the left where you hear the sawing noises Confront Jacques don't you think I should be asking YOU that question

He will tell you there is a key in the shed
On your way out to the shed if you meet up with Lisa don't reveal too much Be careful about giving her too much information Go through the locker room to get outside It is very cold and you are starting to freeze When you enter the shed go down the stairs and then turn to your left and go toward the work benches The key you are looking for is on the peg board near the screwdrivers There is also a newspaper clipping and instructions for the ski lift machine Do this quickly and then leave and go back to the castle To find the Secret Garden leave from the locker room again take steps forward and then click on the NO Trespassing sign Go forward just to the left of that sign Again you are getting cold so you must not take too long Go to the vine covered wall and open the gate Go forward and then left toward the sundial and a statue in the wall Turn the sundial to the left to move the head of the statue Go to the statue and pull the lever in back of the head Take the box out and use the ornate key to open it Take theRED MEDALLION Quickly turn back and leave the garden before you freeze
Talk to Lisa She will tell you that she saw Dexter carrying some green ornament outside by the shed and that you should check it out You don't see anything and when you try to get back in the castle you are locked out Hurry over to the shed and start up the ski lift machine Set the levers according to the diagram and To start the ski lift click on the middle lever once and the right lever twice Dexter will come out to see what is wrong and help you back inside
If you can't get Lisa to tell you about Dexter carrying something green outside by the shed go up to your room and listen to your voice mail Her message is the last one and it will say something about wanting to be friends and to see her because she has something to tell you
When you are back safely go to room to talk with Professor Hotchkiss She will give you a question to answer If you need to find the answer look at the books in the lounge bookcase Once you answer her question correctly she will tell you to meet her in the lounge between and am If you don't know the answer to the question knock on her door again and ask her to repeat the question She will give you another one
Go to your room and set the alarm for am

You have plenty of time now so go up to her room and check it out Read her notes next to the typewriter Open her briefcase and read the letter Move the pillow on the couch and get theBLUE MEDALLION This time you don't get BONKED Go over to the dresser and watch the video on her recorder Place the battery pack on the recharger and come back the next night to watch the remainder of the video
Go back to your room and set the alarm am Go out to the shed and retrieve theGREEN MEDALLIONwhich is on the machine to the right of the ski lift machine Don't let the rat bite you
Return to your room call your friends and listen to your voice mail Set your alarm for am so you can visit Professor's room again and watch the nd half of the video After viewing the last part of the video leave her room and turn right to the very end of the hall where you will find the circular room with the peep hole Peep through that hole witheachmedallion and notice the location of the symbols Red is to the left Blue is to the right and Green is below and center
Time to go to the ROYAL TOWER Take the elevator to the first floor enter the library deactivate the alarm system go up the stairs through the vent and down the shaft to the room under the Basement Solve the door puzzle yet again and then use the Skeleton key on the rod iron gate but not before you get the spear tip from the Tin Soldier
To solve the Chain Puzzle turn around and look at the plaques on the wall opposite the chains The chains should be in that order By pulling each chain it not only activates movement of that particular chain but also one other chain It is not very difficult really but I managed to solve it by clicking on and from left to right
Once you have solved the Chain puzzle you need to move across the stepping stones Go left down the hallway and you will come to what looks like a chess board The idea here is to move the pieces around the board until each lands on top of their corresponding square Place the blue one first yellow next then pink and finally the white one This opens the stairway all the way to the top of the tower
saved game titled SR Tower st time Go up the tower and open the door walk forward several steps and click on the GOLD LEAF puzzle on the wall You can turn each individual piece when you put your arrow cursor in the upper left corner and get a curved cursor When you solve this puzzle you will be able to open the secret compartment

Return to your room and set the alarm to meet Prof Hotchkiss in the lounge Ask her about the translations you saw through the peep holes Give her the journal She says she will wrestle you for it but you say that is not necessary as long as you can have the translation She agrees and says she will have it by this time tomorrow night Time to relax a little and just set your alarm again for am Go down to the lounge and talk with her She tells you that she translated the entire journal and as an extra bonus it includes Marie's official decoder Go up to her room to read the translation which you will find to the right of the typewriter Look at the decoder which is to the left of the typewriter Time to get back to the tower
Place the medallions with Red on left Blue on right and Green at the bottom Go to Marie's portrait and you should get a highlighted cursor on the purple rose
If you come to the part where you should get a highlighted cursor and can't maybe you missed something Here are a few common things missed Did you read the book about Marie Antoinette on the table near the spiral staircase in the library
Did you give Prof Hotchkiss the diary you found in the tower and ask her to translate it
Did you later read the translation and also the coder page
The coder is to the left of the typewriter
When you look at the decoder Nancy will say Purple Rose holds diamond key of Queen
When you looked through the peep hole did you look through witheachof the medallions
Do you have the medallions in the proper order
Red left blue right and green below
Use the tip of the spear to chip away at the portrait and you will get a key Place the key in the center of the medallions The middle of the floor will open and a pedestal with the diamond will come up The diamond thief will also appear and spray your eyes with pepper spray saved game ENDING As the thief tries to run down the stairs quickly find the square stone button on the left side of the wall of the stair well and push it You will trap the thief

Day One Holy Smokes
Maya has been kidnapped the kidnapper threatened us the theater's caretaker wants to help and told us about a secret passsageway
Then we met Brady Armstrong
In the first conversation with Brady avoid mentioning searching until you have no choice left
That way you get the most out of that conversation
Time to search the room
There is not a lot to look at here
Look at the clothes rack and push aside the clothing
There is a door but it doesn't work
Open the Wardrobe and take the magic wand from the top shelf
Look at the makeup table see the locked drawer then inspect the portrait over the sink
By the looks of the money falling out of this guy's pockets I'd say times were good at least for a while
Check behind the picture and pull the handle
You hear something unlock
Check behind the clothes again and the secret passageway is open
Go through
It seems to pass around the backstage area to the other side
If you looked around the backstage already you found the Women's dressing room but it was locked
Now you enter that room through the wardrobe
Meet Simone
She's cranky because we interrupted her business on the phone and tells us to scram
There's not much to do in her room especially with her sitting right there
You can exit via the normal door now and it will remain unlocked
There will be no further need to go through the secret passage
Exit and turn right
Go through that door and take an immediate left into that double door
Step in look down and pick up the coin
Proceed further down the hall working your way to the front of the theater
As you go examine the photos and posters lining the walls
Some of the magicians referred to are made up but Harry Houdini was absolutely real
Read about his performance with the cages his renown for the quot Watery Grave quot illusion and the fact that J J Thompson wagered that Houdini would fail in his attempt
Keep going until you get to the theater lobby
From the central point in the lobby you can look all around
You see left and right sweeping staircases an out of order key machine a game of some sort the door to the ticket booth and a dude in camouflage named Nicholas Falcone
Talk to Nicholas
He represents quot Had It quot which stands for Humans Against the Destruction of Illustrious Theaters
He doesn't seem to take Maya's disappearance very seriously and tells us where a working phone is
It's time we got some professional help
Go into the ticket booth learn the number for the Police Department and call them
You have a conversation with the police sergeant who won't investigate unless Maya is still missing after hours
That's not much help
Let's go see what's upstairs
At the top of the stairs there is a choice to go into the balcony straight ahead or into the projection booth by going across the center
Do that and talk with the caretaker Joseph
He offers to help and informs you that the doors have been locked so there is a limit to the suspects
Save asking about himself until last
Go back downstairs and talk again with Nicholas
You learn what Had It is all about and that the future plans for the site are secret
Let's go see if Simone Mueller will talk now
Off to the Women's dressing room
Simone seems to be more interested in building her career even at Maya's expense
She couldn't have done it
How do you kidnap someone when you are always on the phone
Exit her room and take two steps forward into the backstage area toward that large crate
Look straight down and see that there is a trap door but the crate is blocking it
Hmmm
It's too heavy to budge
Maybe there is some way to move it
Head over to the ropes that control the hanging sets
Untie the rope and lower it all the way down
Something clunks
Return to the crate and you can attach the sling to the overhead cable
Then back at the rope controls you can use the rope to raise the crate
Trouble finding the trap door
Walk toward Simone's room until the floor creaks
Turn around and look down
Now you can enter the basement
Go down and to the right right some more until you come to a panel on the wall
Oh goody
Finally a puzzle
What is the object of the puzzle
What method should I use to figure it out
What is the solution
The door unlocks to reveal another puzzle
This is not a slider it is harder
You must decide which piece goes where and swap them and rotate them until they form a picture
Click here to see the solved box
Click here for brute force instructions
Okay now you've opened the box and discover one more puzzle this time two gears are missing
It's time to go exploring
Go up the stairs turn into the backstage area and walk up to the fire extinguisher
Turn right go through the red curtain and down the steps and turn right toward the center
The right cursor is high up
Walk up the center aisle three steps until you see a piece of bubble gum stuck to one of the chairs
Yuck
You can't take it with your fingers not that you'd want to
Use the magic wand
Now continue to the back of the theater and exit into the lobby
Turn toward the right stairs and find the Bees Knees Jazz Machine
The object here is to guide the musical note from the upper left over to the dancers at the upper right
The other notes slide around when you move and try to block your way
You have to plan your route so the notes get stuck behind the barriers and you can get by
This puzzle is something like the one in the Royal Tower but much easier
There are many successful routes To see one solution Click Here The dancers get their music and you get your gear
One gear to go
Go up to the balcony enter the left side and go look at the railing
See the missing medallion
Where could it be
Try looking over the edge of the railing
Mind you don't get dizzy
Can't quite reach
Do you have something that could extend your reach
Try the wand with the sticky gum
There's your second gear
Down in the basement once again open the box and place the gears on the spindles
Give the main gear a spin and what do we have here
A key those are always handy and an agreement signed by both J J Thompson and Harry Houdini giving Houdini half ownership of the theater in lieu of his reward
Well now
If there is a descendant of Houdini kicking around maybe he she could stop or at least postpone the demolition
Before going upstairs go to the other end of the basement and play with the Amazing Monty machine
Is this game randomized
I don't really know
Sometimes I got lucky on the first try right hand card and sometimes it took three or more attempts
You will eventually find the Ace
Your prize is a piece of flash paper which might be useful for startling someone
Don't get confused with the interface here the flash paper goes into your inventory and the instructions stay with the machine
Don't worry about the instructions to use it just take it from your inventory and 'use' it on the intended target when the time comes
Let's go talk to Nicholas
He tells the story of his grandmother who designed all the fancy decor then was never paid
It seems Nick has something of a motive for saving the theater beyond Had It's connection
Talk to Joseph
He plans to live with his brother Jake in Arizona and build a theater there
He also tells you about J J and the futile efforts to declare the theater a landmark
Talk to Brady
Ask him about Simone
Ask him where he was at the time of the kidnapping
Talk to Simone
Now talk to Nicholas about the papers you found in the basement
He goes to the van to check his computer
While he's gone go forward and look at the Theater brochure where you learn the phone number for the County Administration
Look at the Had It Brochure to see Nick as founder and president
When you step back Joseph calls you on the P A
and says to come to the projection room
He has found Maya's press pass
Rather Brady found it
Joseph suggests calling the police then having a night's rest
Go to the ticket booth and call the county administrator's office first then the police
Day Two Step forward and look at the card on the funeral wreath
Someone sure has a gruesome sense of humor
Go talk with Joseph
On the way in look at the 'missing' poster on his door
Go talk with Nick about the theater
Go talk with Simone about the posters Brady and the wreath
Go to Brady's room and examine the self improvement book he has been reading
Leave his room and come back in
He's back and talks about his being managed by Simone
Maybe he should study that book a little more
Go out front and see Nicholas
He has the number for Houdini's cousin
When you finish with Nick you can hear the press conference in progress
This might be a good time to check out Simone's room more thoroughly and Brady's too
In Simones room look in the drawer
There is an insignificant object to take a bobby pin
Doesn't seem like much but I've seen McGyver pick locks with those things
Her purse yields some interesting items
Her PDA personal digital assistant is not hard to get into click on the center and then the four corners
Her calendar doesn't look like a lot of tragedies are occurring
The e mail suggests that she knew of Maya and probably answered the mail in Maya's name
The business cards are what you'd expect but look at that item on the right a receipt for a funeral wreath
Well Nancy you wanted evidence
Have a look at the camera
Push the red button to turn it on and the key to cycle through the pictures
Hey
There's Maya's pass on the floor in the basement
Now there's Brady finding it
What
There's Brady in the balcony
No wonder he fumbled the answer when we asked him where he found it
I don't think he found it by himself I think somebody staged the whole thing
Hmmmm
Let's check Brady's room again
Look at the locked drawer in the makeup table
Pick the lock with the bobby pin and read the book describing Houdini's cage trick
It seems we have the secret to one of Houdini's famous illusions
It is possible to go below the stage into a secret room and also up into a trick chair in the audience
Clever
Could this be a place to hide someone against their will
Better call Houdini's cousin and see what we can do
When you go toward the lobby you hear another threat over the p a
system
The voice sounds sort of familiar but it is disguised
Go to the ticket booth and call Eustacia
She's a piece of work
She gives you a hard time but she also gives you Sherman Trout's phone number at the Library of Congress
Call Mr Trout and he promises to send a slide of the evidence that Houdini might have been part owner
Go upstairs to talk to Joseph but he is not there
Look at his area
There is a telegram informing him that his brother in Arizona died some time ago
Joseph seems to be hiding that fact
Let's see what we have so far
Joseph is suspect because he has a motive to protect the theater and because he lied about his brother
Nicholas is suspect because he has a personal connection to the theater and he has pulled off a phony kidnapping in the past
Brady and Simone are suspect because they could use a boost to their publicity Simone appears to have sent that ghastly wreath and Brady took part in staging a story about the press pass
Some of the clues tend to point to Joseph He knows his way around the secret passages and could have taken Maya through there
Whoever was at the county and hid the blueprints was a man no further description
The voice making the threatening calls sounded like a man but the voice was disguised could be anyone but the Southern accent showed through
As in quot Don't let the turkeys get you daown quot Go to the control panel
Remember the instruction book that emphasized the settings must be made in the proper order
Here's the sequence At any time during the process you can look up and see the progress of the cages through the window
If you do something out of sequence the process won't work correctly
Back away and begin again at step
Now go onstage and examine the cages
You can look down and see how the mirrors prevent the audience from detecting the trap doors
Enter one of the cages and look down to see the ladder descending to the basement
Go down and find a peep hole in the wall
You discover Maya locked in the Magician's chamber
Suddenly someone closes the trap doors and you are imprisoned
Find the trap door in the floor and go down the stairs
To the left is a slider puzzle lock on the entrance to the magician's room
Try the pieces and they are stuck
Go the other way and press the button that lowers the lift to the trick chair
Go up and find that Joseph is greasing the wheels
Talk to him and he gives you some lubricant
Back to the slider
The object is to move the pieces in order to clear the way for the rabbit to go all the way from right to left
It's not particularly hard just fussy
Go in and discover that Maya was indeed here
You wanted evidence
There's her shoe and some fairly fresh Mama Mia's pizza
Open the chest and take the rubber gloves
Look at the bookcase and read about flash paper again along with some card tricks and a way to reveal a hidden image using a pencil
Exit the room through the casket shaped doorway and you are in the normal basement no longer trapped
Well not exactly
The gate to the stairs is locked and not only that it's electrified
Use the rubber gloves so you can safely touch it
The keypad has a code that you will have to discover on your own
Here's what to do Press buttons until one silently stays down
That's the first number of the nine digit code
Starting with that number press buttons until you learn the second number
Continue searching always repeating the sequence until you know all nine numbers
When you do the gate opens and you can go up
When you get to the backstage area you run into Brady who's acting a bit twitchy as usual
You tell him you need to call the police which you should proceed to do
Now they are interested enough to come and investigate
Go talk with Joseph
Again he suggests you get some rest
When you exit the room Day Two draws to a close
Day Three You begin in the ticket booth reading today's paper
Near the phone is a note from Joseph saying to meet him right away
Go see him and talk about everything including accusing him
He also says something about repairing the key machine
Go see Simone and talk about Brady
Go see Brady and talk about Nick
Go to the projection room
Joseph is gone
Look at the table on the right
Pick up the slide and read the instruction book for the projector
On the last page find the impression left by the key and darken it with the pencil so you can see how it was made
Go back to the projection room
Okay fasten your seatbelts
Things are going to heat up
To the right is a cabinet
Open it and take the projector bulb
Go to the projector and turn it on watching the bulb blow out
Open the projector and replace the bulb with the good one
When you pick up the slide a timed sequence starts and it is Very Short as you will find out
If you try to put the slide in the projector you get nabbed
After they inspect the 'empty' room it's safe to come out
Go to the projector and put the slide in the front compartment
Then turn on the light and focus
Ooops
The focus knob fell off and rolled under the table
Go under the table and find the tape recorder
Pull it out and press play to discover how someone could appear to be in the projection booth while they were actually somewhere else
Push the tape recorder back and retrieve the focus knob
Examine the other box under the table to realize how someone could disguise their voice
To exit this scene look for an up arrow at the top of the screen
Go up twice put the focus knob on the projector and sharpen the picture
Then look at the image closely through the window to learn where the secret switch is to open another passageway
When you back up Joseph appears in the doorway
He's really lost his grip on reality this time
Just talk to him until he goes away
See the duplex outlet that's fancy talk for 'electric plug' to the right of the door
Click on it to open it and flick the switch to gain access to the secret passage
Close the switch box
Turn right and go up the ladder
At the top you find a locked door
You don't really have the key somewhere in your bag of tricks you need to find it
Turn around and find the lock box on the far left wall
Your little key that came from the puzzle box will open this lock
Two important pieces of evidence are there showing that Houdini gave up his title to the theater and Louisa Falcone had ownership
That means Nicholas is part owner
If we don't stop that wrecking ball pretty soon it won't matter who owns it
The correct key changes randomly so take them all
Go back to the locked door and try the keys until you get in
Step in and see Maya locked up
Don't let that music make you nervous
Go to the other side of the room and see the Marquee through the window
If we could turn it on somehow the wrecking crew would realize there is still someone inside and stop the demolition
On the way across the room you can see a hacksaw and you can pick it up
Don't bother you won't be using it
From the window go ahead and to the left looking for the switch to the Marquee
As you find it Joseph turns up again and blocks the way
Talk to him until he says he never meant it to turn out this way
Still have that flash paper
Now is the time to surprise Joseph with it
He steps back and you can reach the switch
Turn on the power to the Marquee and all's well that ends well
Congratulations Detective Drew another fine solution to a tough case
See you in the next one

Day One Holy Smokes
Maya has been kidnapped the kidnapper threatened us the theater's caretaker wants to help and told us about a secret passsageway
Then we met Brady Armstrong
In the first conversation with Brady avoid mentioning searching until you have no choice left
That way you get the most out of that conversation
Time to search the room
There is not a lot to look at here
Look at the clothes rack and push aside the clothing
There is a door but it doesn't work
Open the Wardrobe and take the magic wand from the top shelf
Look at the makeup table see the locked drawer then inspect the portrait over the sink
By the looks of the money falling out of this guy's pockets I'd say times were good at least for a while
Check behind the picture and pull the handle
You hear something unlock
Check behind the clothes again and the secret passageway is open
Go through
It seems to pass around the backstage area to the other side
If you looked around the backstage already you found the Women's dressing room but it was locked
Now you enter that room through the wardrobe
Meet Simone
She's cranky because we interrupted her business on the phone and tells us to scram
There's not much to do in her room especially with her sitting right there
You can exit via the normal door now and it will remain unlocked
There will be no further need to go through the secret passage
Exit and turn right
Go through that door and take an immediate left into that double door
Step in look down and pick up the coin
Proceed further down the hall working your way to the front of the theater
As you go examine the photos and posters lining the walls
Some of the magicians referred to are made up but Harry Houdini was absolutely real
Read about his performance with the cages his renown for the quot Watery Grave quot illusion and the fact that J J Thompson wagered that Houdini would fail in his attempt
Keep going until you get to the theater lobby
From the central point in the lobby you can look all around
You see left and right sweeping staircases an out of order key machine a game of some sort the door to the ticket booth and a dude in camouflage named Nicholas Falcone

By Her Interactive Walkthrough by Norma Kuderna and Linda Shaw August This walkthrough is written for junior and senior detective modes If this is your first time playing a Nancy Drew game try the tutorial on the cd rom This game is non linear but certain things have to be done before you can proceed For example you can do the activities in the temple but you won't be able to get past the last quiz question It is easier to finish all your tasks in the lab first The only difference that I could see between the junior and senior detective mode is that the maze is harder when you play as a senior detective
Nancy is working for the Beech Hill museum in Washington DC as a deputy curator This is an internship position which her dad rsquo s friend Franklin Rose helped her get Beech Hill museum is closed now and getting ready for an Ancient Mayan Culture exhibit
Nancymeets Joanna Riggs hellip
In the exhibit hall She shows Nancy the jade carving of King Pacal Later they talk in her office and she tells Nancy there is a list of tasks she would like done on Nancy rsquo s desk in the lab Before you leave Joanna rsquo s office look at the magazines on the round table in the corner Look at ldquo Art in the America rsquo s rdquo Click on the paragraph about Rutherford on page Nancy will say ldquo Topeka Commission for the Arts hellip how cultured rdquo Now you can look through the rest of the article

For Questions or Comments on this Walkthrough Please write to NKudernaorLShaw Copyright August updated GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
GameBoomers Walkthrough by Tally Ho The introductory sequence reveals your new position Assistant to Joanna Riggs at the Beech Hill Museum
Your father's friend Frederick Rose used his influence to help get the job
Joanna explains what the exhibit is all about and introduces three names during the conversation Alejandro del Rio Mexican Consulate Taylor Sinclair Dealer of Antiquities and Henrik van der Hune Expert on Mayan writings
If you ask for quot any last advice quot as your final question she says quot Semper ubi sub ubi quot Cute
The Latin translates into nonsense quot Always where under where quot But if you read that sentence aloud it sounds like quot Always wear underwear quot Good advice Joanna thanks
She says you have several tasks ahead so head to the other end of the building and find the Laboratory
As you step out of the office the main entrance to the Museum is just to your right
Exiting there will take you to the Washington Metro and access to several other locations
Turning left takes you into the museum's exhibition hall
Straight ahead is the receptionist's area
Go there and pick up a guide to the museum
See where it says quot Ekahau God of Travelers quot on the front and two more clues on the inside
Jot these down you will need to recall them later
As you study other museum exhibits there will be little tidbits of information you will either have to remember or return to find it Taking notesis the key to success in this game
Notice the display of headphones behind the desk
You can't open it yet
Go into the Exhibition Hall
Explore if you like but you will be wanting to visit those displays with the headphones on
Continue to the far end of the room until you come to the base of the pyramid
Look to the right and you will see two more doors
One is an open archway to the garden area and the other is a door leading to the employee's area
Go there
Introduce yourself to Henrik van der Hune
He talks about his field of expertise translating Mayan glyphs
After speaking with him you should examine the broken pot and the ham radio seen near his desk and the Spectro Analyzer that big blue machine on the other side of the lab
Click on the power switch on each machine
Talking with Henrik again will reveal information about all three items
Go now to your desk the one to the left of the door and examine the clipboard containing a list of chores for you to finish
The first one seems obvious re assemble that broken pot as soon as you find the missing piece s that is
It appears Sonny already did the second one as well as the last two
What's this priority job
Take a paper to the Consulate
Something else to look for I guess
Order Bubble Wrap
That's easy enough the phone number for packing supplies is right there next to the phone
Call Silvio's at
Oops Silvio is not too thrilled to hear from Beech Hill
Seems they haven't been paying their bills
Oh well at least you can cross that chore off the list
Look in Sonny's desk drawer
Three things to get a loosecabinet knob hisnotebookcontaining much information that we don't quite understand yet including a map of the display cases that looks like it will come in mighty handy and aKoko KringleKandy bar
Make a mental note of the name of the candy and what that cow logo looks like
You just might need to remember it later
Let's exit the lab and go straight across the hall into the shipping receiving room
Take a couple of steps into the room and turn around to face the doorway
You can see the phone and a clipboard on the wall
Reading the clipboard reveals one item of interest
Number is an ornamental jade with an unidentified glyph
If you explore the items on the shelves you will find several containers all locked
The one labeled BH has a keypad lock on it
Perhaps we will find the code somewhere
On the other set of shelves is an open carton containing quot Sonny's Stuff quot Look in the box and take two items acomputer diskof Sonny's and apiece of that broken pot
Before exiting go towards the door and look to the right wall
Between the stepladder and the shelves is a panel of some sort on the wall
Examine it and you will discover that it is the control for the audio clips that accompany the exhibits
One of your chores tells you to match the narrations with their appropriate exhibits
Can't do much without more information so let's head out and go to the entrance area of the building again
Go around behind the receptionist's desk and put that knob on the cabinet
Now you can open it andtake a headphone
While you are right there open the drawer in the desk and take thekey card
Let's go ahead and tackle that audio system
Write down the letters A O on a column then visit each exhibit and place a descriptive word by each letter
For example A Ham Radio F Mayan Influence etc
When that list is complete return to the control panel in the Shipping Room
Open any one of the controllers let's use A as an example
On first inspection you see the large letter A a green arrow and up and down arrows
The A never changes it is tied to the location where you saw the Ham Radio exhibit
The green arrow plays the currently selected audio piece and the up and down arrows change the selection
Suggested procedure Stick with A and using the up and down arrows start with and listen to each audio blurb from to
Using the list you created write the numbers representing the audio selections opposite the descriptive name you chose
If you were really observant you realized that several of the audio selections played correctly
In fact ten are okay and only five need to be fixed
The wrong ones are A C D G and J
Want the complete layout
Too lazy to create your own huh Click Here Might as well return to the lab and cross off that item from the to do list
Go to the center of the entrance lobby area and look around
See the three tall advertisements one blue and two red
Look at the red one to the left of the entrance between there and the Receptionist's
Look closer and find apaper airplaneon the floor
Pick it up and it turns out to be the document that needs to go to Alejandro
Whoo
Half a million dollars and that's only the quot rental quot Head out the big brass door and take the Metro to the Consulado de M xico
Examine the table across from the entrance and read a pamphlet regarding provenance
Talk with Alejandro and near the end of the conversation give him the documents
He will not let you take them back not to worry
Just return to the Museum and go about more of those chores
When you get back go all the way through the Exhibit Hall and up the steps into the Temple
Straight ahead and slightly right is a stone plinth with two bowls displayed on it
Look closely at the bowls and find anotherpiece of the broken pot
Go back to the lab
If you have two pieces in inventory you will be able to assemble the pot
The turntable rotates and you should be able to figure out what goes where
It's pretty easy and when it's done it's done
Let's check the list
Well
only one chore left
quot Re order the Number Exhibit quot What's that all about
Go to the exhibits and find the Number display
It's at location D Oh no
Some of the numbers are bars and dots which we can figure out easily enough but some are god heads which also stand for numbers
What's worse two tiles are missing
Some research is necessary
Head to your hotel room it's time for some research Go to your laptop computer and before you turn it on by clicking on the screen insert Sonny's disk in the drive
The drive in the computer is the floppy that thing next to it is a Zip drive
You will find a Zip disk later
Clicking on the computer icon reveals your personal notes
These expand as you progress through the game
Clicking on the Floppy icon prompts you to enter a password
If you enter the wrong password or none it buzzes and shows you that cow logo you saw before Remember the name of the candy
Under quot Stuff to do quot is something we know already
quot Stuff to to quot is the important one it tells all about the numbering system
Want to do it yourself
Make a list of twenty numbers from Zero to Nineteen
Make a brief description such as quot Hat quot quot Doctor quot and so on next to the numbers they represent
The bars and dots are easy the dots are one each and the bars are five
So if you ever see three bars and two dots for example that's seventeen
Take care though looking at the dots
They must be dots not some other little symbol
If another symbol appears where a dot could be just ignore it
So three bars two dots and a little 'thing' between them is still seventeen
Stuff to forget
I think not
Look at the top of the page and you will get Sonny's log in namesjoonand his password spacebaby
Before you leave the hotel room reset the Alarmto morning
a m is good
You need to find the two missing pieces for the number exhibit
Go to the Maya Influence exhibit position F and open the display case
Look closer and find one of the tiles
Now go around the left side of the Pyramid and enter the garden
Ahead to the right is the Bicephalic Altar
Find the other number tile sitting there
Now you can head back to the number case and put it all in sequence Click here to see it solved
Take the Metro to Sinclair's office
If you did not encounter him in the garden you must do so to make the location accessible
If you still need to do that go to the monolith and look at it close up
Talk to Sinclair about everything
Go back to the Museum and talk with Joanna now
Be sure to ask her about Henrik and where he worked before
If you did not happen to look at the magazines on the little table inspect them now to see an article about Prudence Rutherford and her necklace the one Sinclair said was stolen
Looks something like the Pacal jade
If you looked at the brass plaque listing the Museum's Donors you note the connection with Ms Rutherford if you haven't looked at the plaque do it now
It's just outside the office
Go back to the lab and cross off the chores you have finished
When you exit the lab the security alarm sounds and Joanna tells you the Museum's been robbed
Someone stole the Pacal jade and she's in deep doo doo now
Inspect the crime scene and discover the Scarlet Hand
Talk to Joanna about everything including evidence the police found
She tells you to have a look around
Go back to the Pacal exhibit and take the red hand
Talk to Joanna about the red hand you found and Henrik's whereabouts
She asks you to analyze the Scarlet Hand
Go into the lab and straight ahead to the Spectro Analyzer that big blue machine
Turn on the power and place the red hand in the compartment on the left
Press Start to do the analysis
The graph appears and you need to find the matching compound
Press quot Compare quot then the left arrow until the graphs match
About six hits on the right arrow oronce to the leftwill do it
Then press quot Match quot HgS quot That's it quot she says
Huh
That's what
It's a symbol for a chemical compound
If you have forgotten your high school chemistry not to worry
There is a Periodic Table of Elements on the wall and this one has a feature that most tables do not hotspots that automatically tell you what you want to know
The spot at the right end of the red area reveals that Hg stands for Mercury and the spot in the upper right yellow area tells you that S stands for Sulfur
Everything you ever wanted to know about Mercury Sulfide can be seen at this website http mineral galleries com minerals sulfides cinnabar cinnabar htm Report your findings to Joanna
She tells you that Mercury and Sulfur make a mineral called Cinnabar
Also ask her about obtaining some Cinnabar and the whereabouts of Henrik ESSENTIAL Use the phone in the lab to call quot Keep It Real quot
Learn that someone named J R ordered cinnabar just last week
We really should talk to Henrik about all this
Let's go see if he is in the garden
Nope not there
Oh No
As you return to the gallery Henrik turns up all right on his back at the foot of the stairs
He is hauled off to the hospital and you end up in your room talking with Bess and George
Before you leave set the time to a m Back at the Museum talk with Joanna
She seems to be slipping a notch or two
Go to the lab and check your voice mail
You should have two messages one from Franklin Rose and one from Nurse Bluefoot
Call them both
Let's visit the hospital and see what's going on
Go see Henrik
He seems to have sort of a selective memory
Put the Scarlet Hand on his bulletin board
He can still read Mayan glyphs but doesn't recall anything about the theft
We haven't seen the greaseball for a while
Go to Taylor Sinclair's office and be sure to ask him for a photo of the Pacal carving
Take it and scoot right over to the hospital
It jogs Henrik's memory and you learn that he stole the Pacal carving in order to prevent someone more dangerous from finding it
He hid it so well even he can't remember where it is
He gives you a key
The key he gave you fits his desk
Examine the top of the desk and find a number for the Chaco Canyon Cultural Center
Read the book on operating the Dyna Ham radio and instructions for Morse Code
Open the top drawer and take the Zip disk
Open the bottom drawer and find three things A sheaf of papers describing an expedition he shared with someone known as Big Bunny a page of his personal translation notes and a book with instructions for contacting the smugglers
On page four it says the password is theNahuatl word for quot Snake quot Who do we know who comes from central America
Talk to Alejandro about everything
Ask him EVERYTHING from the top down
To get the word for 'snake' hewants some documentsin trade
Be sure to ask him aboutcinnabar and your suspicions of Joanna
Some quick stops from here Stop by the hospital and put Henrik's notes on the board
Then go to the hotel and call Franklin Rose
Ask him about Prudence Rutherford and get her telephone number
It's
Don't call her just yet give Franklin time to talk to her Do callthe Chaco Canyon Cultural Center
Ask about the theft Henrik Sinclair and a photo
Set the clock for morning Now you can call Prudence Rutherford
Be sure you DO NOT insult her about the Corn Growers Ball or you will be el stucko
If you need to get un stuck call her back and apologize
You must get her to agree to send you the replica of her stolen necklace
Now try Henrik at the hospital
Take careful note of his work especially the new glyph meaning quot stone quot Talk with him about the Prison of Stone and the Whisperer's soul
When his memory stops working go to the hotel and put the Zip disk into the external drive and open the files on the disk with the password stone
There are several important clues on this disk
Read the translation it's not essential
Open the Notes and pay close attention to the following atanzahab is a Matchmaker a necessary clue for the Quiz
The Prison of Stone uses a six sided jade lock
Whisperer there must be a mechanism for escape
West Henry Daddle phone no

Copan Fool use the Ham Radio to obtain this one
Under the Contacts folder learn that the password for the smugglers is quot snake quot in Nahuatl
You already know that from the book in his desk
When you exit the computer grab the phone and call Henry Daddle
He tells you his daughter Penelope has the jade carving now
Call her at and talk with her about Taylor Sinclair It turns out his nickname is Big Bunny and the painting with the rubber shark
While you are at the telephone callChaco Canyon again and ask for a replica of the carving
You will need to call them again later
Things are starting to move now
Let's see if we can get that piece out of the painting
Set the clock for morning before you leave
Go to Sinclair's office
Talk to him
Take a cookie then examine the painting
Sinclair conveniently leaves the office
Looking closely at the painting you find the jade piece
Substitute the cookie for the carving
Wow
That was easy
Return to the Museum
Go into the office and Joanna should be missing
Peek in her microscope if you like then look at the items on her desk
See the packing list
It's a copy of the one on the wall in the shipping room
Again notice Number the Diego de Landa carving from Cuba
This is one of the items listed in Henrik's notes
See the blue photo frame
quot Gocats quot is the screen name of the gal who quot runs quot the forums at HER Interactive
Cute
Open the desk drawer andtake the key
Go to the filing cabinet open the drawer and take out the Pacal Provenance file
Read the documents
Eight hundred grand for that little bauble
Wow
The papers look in order to me but Alejandro wants to read them Take the file to him
He tells you the Nahuatl word for quot Snake quot in return
Go see Henrik at the hospital and talk about the six keys
Let's go see if we can raise anybody on that Ham radio in the lab
Turn on the power to the radio and Oh No
We blew a tube
What now
Maybe thatother radioin the exhibit case has a usable tube in it
Open the display case with Joanna's key turn the radio so you can get to the side panel and take the tube
It looks okay
Back in the lab install the replacement tube and turn on the power
That's better
I'll bet a lot of GameBoomers remember radios with tubes that occasionally blow out
I certainly do
Let's see the instructions said to tune into to get the code for the real frequency
To do that press the two the zero the five the zero and the quot Connect quot button
The voice comes on and says quot ocho tres dos siete uno quot That's
The instructions said to take the last three numbers and attach a zero so
Then add up all five digits that's and add that to
That comes to
Try that frequency and see if anybody's home
If you happened to play with the radio before and tune into this frequency you got a message saying this channel does not receive any transmissions
Now you are told to transmit
First you must send the password quot coatl quot This is an unusual Morse code device in that you can back up if you need to
Let's hope you don't need to
quot C quot is dash dot dash dot
So press those symbols then press quot send quot This transmits the letter quot C quot
quot O quot is dash dash dash quot A quot is dot dash quot T quot is dash quot L quot is dot dash dot dot
Press the send button after each group
Sending coatl gets the request to send you intended message
The word to send is quot leche quot
L dot dash dot dot E dot C see above H four dots
You are told the package will be dispatched the fastest possible way
Now transmit the word quot vacas quot meaning payment is sent
V dot dot dot dash and S three dots
Go to the Hotel
Set the clock to daytime and call Sheila at the Chaco Canyon
She will be sending you something useful
By this time we are expecting three packages
The smuggler's and shipments from Chaco Canyon and Prudence
Have a look in the Shipping room
Go to the shipping dock and there should be something there
If you open it and find a puzzle box with three faces set the eyes so they are all crossed
You can actually do it in four clicks
Number the eyes from left to right
Click in this order
The box can now be opened and the jade piece is yours
Go to the lab and check your voice mail
Uh oh Joanna is in trouble with the Board of Directors
Call Franklin rose and talk to him
If you can get the Pacal carving back maybe they'll un suspend her
Go to the hospital and tell Henrik you received the piece from his friends
He now tells you that the Pacal ishidden in the tombat the bottom of the Temple and that Sonny was afraid of acoatimundi Back to the museum with you
Go to the shipping room and check
Prudence's package could be there
If it is take the jade piece
Let's head into the temple and tackle those quizzes and games
Go up the steps into the pyramid
You will find three tasks
Be sure always to swipe your card before each task
Let's do the easiest one first
Straight ahead is a matching game
There are six glyphs and six words
If you have been a diligent explorer you will have seen all but one of these scattered throughout the various exhibits
However it is possible to solve this game with no knowledge using the following procedure
Click on a glyph then on a word
If you are correct it will stay lit
Remember the pairing
It takes no time at all using this brute force method to learn which goes with which
Match them all and 'Ding' the bell says you are done
Looking around the room you see two computers and a door with a key slot
Go to the computer that is near the locked door put your card in the slot and select either Activity Instructions to get some help View your progress to see that you have satisfied the match up game or take the five question quiz
The answers are contained in the audio and video blurbs that go with the exhibits and it you have not been taking notes or don't have a photographic memory you may need to re visit some of the exhibits
This is a walkthrough so I will provide the answers
The following table tells you where do do your research the lazy way is to click on the question for a spoiler
Question Click on question to reveal answer
Location of Answer
Pacal ruled over which ancient city
E Who is Pacal's mother
M
What is the day calendar called
I Who is the quot Supreme God quot M
What is a modern language
D The other computer contains the Bul game where the object is to roll the 'dice' and move the appropriate steps
You go first for two turns
You must roll once but can pass the second turn if desired
The computer must also roll and canpass if desired
The advantage you have is YOU decide whether the computer rolls or passes at its second turn
This gives you a big edge because when the computer's second turn is a threat to you you can pass him and roll yourself
This game is easy to beat once you see how to restrict the computer's choices
Passing all three tasks on this level will activate your card to unlock the door
Descend to the Second level
Level Two contains three games as well
A five question quiz a Ball Game and a Maze
I HATE MAZES and have said so for years
This one is no more friendly than any other except that there is a neat way to handle it
While you are negotiating the maze press quot M quot and you will have a mapthat shows the layout of the maze and your current position
All mazes should have this feature
THANK YOU H E R
Interactive
Just to show you what a sport I am I am going to negotiate the maze first
See ya smiling I hope
Actually the map is confusing because it is mirror imaged or something
You come to a corner and the map shows a right turn is required but in the maze itself you must turn left
Confusing but still usable
Even I got through this maze without cussing
By the way the login is sjoon and the password is spacebaby found on Sonny's disk
Here are the five questions found in the quiz Question Click on question to reveal answer
Location of Answer Who was Jaguar's wife
Near O
Life and Death Cycle C
What was she wearing
Near H
What is a Cahal
H Who was a Mayan Matchmaker
Zip Disk You need to play the ball game
Throw the ball through the hoop by setting the power and angle selections
As a rule the farther away you are from the target the more power you need usually and a lower angle
Figure it out yourself orcheat by clicking here
Go toward the stairs and around to the right appreciating the exhibits on the way
In the next room you find another match up game
This one's longer but it works the same way Here's the cheat if you need it
Then across the bridge is another quiz
Do not try to go through that big wooden door yet What animalwas Pacal afraid of
Remember whatHenrik told you
This quiz contains only one question
Your card will now open Pacal's tomb
It is located in the same alcove as the Calendar puzzle
Open the lid move the jade mask and take the Jade
When you leave be sure to take the light stick
Wow high tech stuff in a Mayan exhibit
Maybe Sonny was onto something after all
Now go back to the wooden door at the end of the creaky bridge go through and use your light stick to find the exit
The exit places you in the garden
Go to the shipping room and pick up the final package
It sure looks like a mold
Take it to the lab and place it under that device next to the Periodic Chart
Click on the gadget to bring it down click again to create the casting
Open the package and voil
Use the phone to call Franklin Rose Tell him the Pacal is safe and you want Joanna back
He agrees
Go see Joanna you might have to reset the time and she gives you the code to that locked container referred to in the document on her desk
Open the box with the code and now you have all six pieces
Time to assemble the key
Use the turntable next to the pot you assembled
The base appears there and the first piece that must be installed is the top
Rotate the base until the top fits then press the side pieces into place
You can see what shape fits which side
Now go to the Exhibit where thecalendar stones are
Location I
Unlock the case and take the stones
Close the case and go directly to the Monolith
Install the stones on the monolith
The calendar must be set to the date the king ascended to the throne
Remember the information from the exhibit located at location J
It said the king took the throne on Lamat
Need to see what Lamat looks like Click here
Rotate the outer ring until Lamat is at the o'clock position then rotate the number ring until six is there also
Click
A square block slides inward
Try the key there
Rotate it until another block slides in
Keep up the process until all four sides have been unlocked
The door opens and you are face to face with the scribe's mummy and her notes
Look at the book
Oh
It's blank
Now what
You can save your game if you like but if you don't succeed in the next task you get a Second Chance
Taylor Sinclair appears and you learn he has been behind all the trouble just so he can get the scribe's writings and sell them on the black market
He locks you in
There is not much air you must act quickly and accurately
Use the light stick
You are facing the exit
Turn around to face the mummy click on her and take the object from her jaws
Turn right once facing the wall left of the exit and look up
Find the spot to insert the object
Then turn all the way around facing the wall right of the exit and look down
down arrow and move the stone lid
You happen to find the real writings
Move them and take the small object
Now turn left and look up finding the spot
Insert the object in the eye and the door opens
Congratulations Detective Drew on solving another difficult case
See you in the next one

Nancy Drew Ghost Dogs Of Moon Lake Complete Walkthrough Written by Linda Shaw amp Norma Kuderna This is a complete walkthrough for the game Nancy Drew Ghost Dogs Of Moon Lake
This walkthrough is written for playing in Junior Mode
Begin the game by learning that Nancy has received an invitation to Sally McDonald's cabin on Moon Lake in Pennsylvania
When she arrives at the cabin she finds that sall sorts of weird things have been happening
For instance a tree falls in the driveway path blocking her exit from the cabin and the lake
Upon completion of the letter walk forward to the kitchen area
Turn right and look to the left of the ice chest on the table
Pick up thebottled water
Zoom out from this screen and turn left towards the kitchen sink
Pick up theglovesin the sink
Look up in the cabinet above the sink and pick up theflashlightand themap of the Forest
Move away from the kitchen area and walk to the back door by the coocoo clock on the wall
Before leaving the cabin click on the coocoo clock and then click on the dial
Watch what happens
As soon as you move to leave via the door the phone rings
Answer the phone and talk to Sally on her cell phone
When your conversation ends or is disconnected leave via the door by the clock
As soon as you exit the door Red Knott shows up
He's a birdwatcher and does most of his bird watching from a nearby tree on Sally's property
What's even stranger is that he does all of this at NIGHT only
Hhhhmmm something's odd about that character
Speak to Red about everything
When your conversation ends walk around to the left of the cabin and enter the shed
Zoom in on the nut cracker on the shelf and you'll see an iron and a small chest
Pick up the small key between the iron and the chest
Zoom out and turn right
Zoom in on the wooden crate on the table
Use the key you just picked up on the lock of the crate
The key breaks off
Darn there's got to be another way to get into that crate
Head back to the cabin
Once inside turn to exit through the front door
Ehhhh
What's that
Go out the front door and turn left times
Lift the blue tarp and take board
Notice that the cellar is locked
Also take note of the compass tile in front of the cellar door
Head back to the cabin but rather than go inside at this point and since we're having so much fun in the dark on a night with a full moon dogs howling and strange noises lets keep having fun
Turn left and head into the forest
Go on
Don't be chicken
You've got yourForest map don't you
Just a few clicks into the Forest and you'll see a tree stump on your right
Takeboard on top of the tree trunk
Proceed forward then right and use the map in your inventory to make your way all the way to the Cemetery
One or two clicks forward into the cemetery and you'll see a tombstone on the left
Zoom in on the WALDO tombstone
More on that much later in the game
Grabboard on the ground in the middle of the path
Now turn around and head back to the house
You should have boards in your inventory at this point along with other items
Now that you're safely back at the cabin turn to go upstairs
Read the plaque on the wall
This will come in handy later on
As you are headed upstairs you'll have the opportunity to change from night to day
Switch to daytime
Head back downstairs and move to the cabinet above the sofa by the telephone
Notice the dog statues
Three of them will move but one is stuck
We'll have to figure out what we need to make that one move
Exit the cabin via the back door by the clock and make your way around the cabin to the well pump
Zoom in on the well and use yourbottled waterto prime the pump
Take thebucketdown below the pump
Turn and make your way to the dock where the boat is
Use the bucket times to bail out the water in the boat
Grab thescrewdriverat the bottom of the boat
Take thelife jacketas well
The bucket automatically goes back into your inventory
Turn and go back to the well
Put the bucket down and pump some water into the bucket
Leave the bucket there for now
Go around the cabin to the shed the path leading to the left as you're facing the dock and go inside
Zoom in on the wooden crate on the table and use the screwdriver you picked up from the boat on the screws that hold the lock in place
Inside the wooden crate take the hammer nails and the gas mask
Gas mask
Oh my goodness what's Nancy in store for
After picking up the hammer nails and the gas mask go back to the house and enter through the rear door by the dock
Turn to the right and click on therotten boardson the floor
Zoom in a little closer and Nancy will say quot This doesn't look very safe quot Use the boardsin your inventory and then thehammer nails
Walk to the wall click on the post it note
Exit the shed and make your way back to the dock
You'll need to get thetest kitfrom Park Ranger Akers first
But how
We need to get to the boat
Look closely at the outboard motor
Notice that a sparkplug is missing
We'll need to get one but where
Use Nancy's PDA in your inventory and note that she recommends calling Sally and asking about a sparkplug
Turn around and head back to the cabin
Call Sally and talk to her about the dogs
Ask Sally about the three people she spoke with before she left
Also ask her about the sparkplug sandpaper wall hanging with the poem and if she's aware that she owns her own cemetery
When you're finished with your conversation you'll know that Red Knotts is your only hope for a sparkplug to fix the motor on the boat
He only bird watches at night time so you'll need to go to sleep for a little while
All that hiking and walking in nature has tired you out anyway
Head upstairs and change to night
Come down and exit the rear door
Turn right at the dock and go all the way down to the tree and up the steps
Talk to Red about thesparkplug
In exchange for a sparkplug he asks you to take digital pictures of birds in the Forest
Oh brother one more thing to get involved in
Oh well say your good bye's to Red and return to the cabin
Get some rest and start fresh in the morning
Exit the cabin head back into the Forest use your Forest map and take pictures of anOrange bird aBlue birdand aYellow bird
The Red bird and other two birds will elude you for now
You're too obvious and scare them off
What now
Return to the boat click on the motor
Time to look under the hood literally
Look at the diagram showing how each of the sparks should be set in order for the boat to work right
Use your sparkplug from your inventory on the top slot
Now use the screwdriver for quot torque quot and adjust each of the sparks according to the diagram under the hood
When all have been set close the lid and pull the cord
You're off
First stop Em's Emporium
Talk to Em and ask about thecassette playerthat Red left there
Put that in your inventory
Also ask about sandpaper
Appears that Red stocked up on a lot of things
Exit the shop and head over to the Park Ranger's office
Meet Jeff Akers
Talk to him about atest kit put that in your inventory too the cemetery and Malone
Ask him if the dogs are buried there
Then take a look around the Park Office and note thecomputer database
Look up some historical facts about Moon Lake and famous residents that once lived there
Exit the Park Office and head back to Sally's
Check yourPDAagain and notice that Nancy should listen to the bird calls now that she has the cassette player
Click on thecassette playerin your inventory then use thecassette tapewith the recorder
Listen to the various bird calls
Go back to the cabin area and around the side of the house to the well
Use the test kit on the bucket of water at the base of the well tap
Return the test water to Ranger Akers and then get back to the cabin
All that boating around Moon Lake has tired you out
Why not take a quick nap
Head upstairs change to p m and then go out to visit Red Knotts again
Ask him about the sandpaper
Take thesandpaperand leave him to the birds lol
Go back to the house and zoom in on the cabinet above the sofa
Use the sandpaper on the nd statue
This releases the hold and enables you to move the nd statue
Rotate the statues so they look like the diagram below When the statues are moved into the positions shown above a secret panel is revealed
This must lead somewhere
Let's check it out
Head down the steps use yourflashlight
Enter the basement and put away the flashlight can't go around wasting batteries can we
Turn left and move forward
On the upper right side of that ugly wall there is a quot hot spot quot Click on the hot spot several times and you'll see a safe
Nancy says quot Looks like a tiny hole quot Turn around and exit through the metal door

Run over to the well where you left the bucket of water
Grab the bucket of water and use it on the fire
As soon as you have put out the fire Red Knotts appears convenient of him isn't it You've never seen him in the daytime

The next morning head over to Em's Emporium and ask her where she finds her antiques Ask her everything else that's available Visit Jeff Akers and ask about Joe Akers and William Akers Talk to him a nd time he'll apologize for his rudeness
Ask about his grandfather
Return to the cabin and notice theladderon the left side of the house Walk up the ladder and you'll discover that the speaker box is no longer there That's curious Must have been those sounds you heard while sleeping the other night Take a hike out to the cemetery and examine thefour dog tombstones close to the crypt Notice the paw prints on the crypt You can open the crypt and step forward if you want but there's nothing to see in there
Once back at the cabin go back downstairs to the cellar door You'll see aframed photographon the door Take that and then go visit Jeff Akers Ask him about the photograph and if he knows the two people standing in the photo

Click on W times
Click on the U times Click on the E times and finally Click on the U times Viola the tombstone has revealed a secret passage to the Speakeasy
When you've done it correctly the crypt opens Go down into the secret passage and you'll realize quickly that your flashlight batteries have worn out Oh no Now what Turn around and walk forward a couple of clicks Move the mouse cursor over to the left side of your screen until you get a Left Arrow Turn left and then put the cursor on the middle of the page for the quot hot spot quot to open the crypt door Exit and run don't walk through the Forest and back to the boat Push that outboard motor to the limit as you rush over to Em's Emporium What better place to get handy little flash light batteries right Ask her for some batteries She'll tell you that in exchange for thebatteries she'd like you to arrange thecoke displayaccording to the illustration she gives you see picture below When you're finished turn back to Em and take the flashlight batteries Now skip waves back over to the cabin and make your way back to the cemetery Once there you'll have to do the quot letter jumble quot again on the tombstone Back at the cemetery use the same method as described above to open the tombstone With fresh batteries in your flashlight you're good to go on a tunnel search Once down inside the tunnel follow it along until it splits into two different directions left or right Let's go right Why not Take the right path all the way until the end There will be a big metal door Click on the handle and Viola You've found the Speakeasy Look at all the paintings of all four dogs Zoom in on each one and Nancy will mark the dog's favorite locations on the map in the inventory Iggy's is already marked with an quot I quot on the front porch of the cabin It is VERY IMPORTANT that you make note of each dog's COLORED COLLAR They are Lucy Green collar Xander Red collar Vitus Blue collar and Iggy Yellow collar Move to the double doors with the board across it and remove the board This will allow access from the basement of the cabin to the Speakeasy in the future Turn and go behind the bar and look at Iggy Turn and face the rest of the bar and you'll see the spigot puzzle Now what
The idea behind this puzzle is to click on the spigots one at a time and then push the red button This causes the letters to rotate There appears to be no logical explanation for the correct sequence of letters but they should be arranged as X V I and L Roman Numerals and To accomplish this make the following moves Number the spigots going from left to right
Click on the first spigot one time and then click the red button
Repeat this process more times It will land on the X Click the nd spigot time and then click the red button

Finish Exploring the House Wake up and go downstairs Now is a good time to finish checking out the house Go to the kitchen area and look in the sink Take therubber gloves Now look at the sticky note above the sink Sounds like Sally has a lot of work to do on the house Open the cabinet above the sink and take theflashlightandmap of the forest
To the left of the sink is the note from Sally Turn right and see a door To the right of the door is a plaque Zoom in and Nancy will read the poem out lout Go over to the staircase There is a sticky note on the side of the stairs Go and read it Uh oh looks like the floorboards really are rotten On the main menu selectsecond chance Look above the couch now There is a cabinet Open the cabinet and see wood carvings of dogs probably Malone rsquo s Each of the dogs can move except Iggy Keep your eyes out for sandpaper Turn around and see a door To the right of the door there is some kind of clock It looks like a coo coo clock
Play around with it and see more dogs Now look at the other door You can snoop around more if you like or you can head outside
Outside of Sally rsquo s House Go out the door in the kitchen area Once outside turn right and see a water pump Notice that this pump will not pump any water out Look down and pick up thewooden bucketfrom under the pump Turn left twice and see a path Follow the path to find a shed Shed Go into the shed then go forward and see a gnome Click near the iron and the box to see akey Hmm hellip wonder what that goes to Look to the left and see a pump of some sort that makes Nancy cough Turn right and see a box Try using the key we just got to open the box Ah darn the key broke off Look at the top of the box where the lock is screwed on I gotta have some torque
Motor Boat Go back to the house and then out to the dock Go over to the motor boat Uh oh it rsquo s full of water Good thing that we picked that bucket up from the pump Use the bucket to pour all of the water out of the boat At the bottom pick up thescrewdriver Click on the engine box and pull the cord Notice that the sparkplug is missing Looks like we won rsquo t be going anywhere until we get that fixed
Turn around and let rsquo s explore the opposite side of the house See a stepping stone path that leads to a cellar door and a big blue tarp Under the tarp findboard Take it and put the tarp back down Now turn towards the locked cellar door Look down and see a stepping stone with a compass rose
Shed Go back to the shed and try using the screwdriver that you found in the boat to unfasten the screws of the top of the wooden box to the right Yay it works Open the box and takea hammer and some nailsanda mask
Talk to Red Knott Let rsquo s go see if Red can supply us with an extra sparkplug Since he will only be on his platform at nighttime go back to the house and go upstairs changing the time to P M To find him head towards the dock like you rsquo re going to the boat but slightly before you get there turn right and follow another path He will be up in his observation platform Remember toalwaysexhaust all conversations with everyone Learn that Red has an extra sparkplug but in exchange for it you are going to have to take some pictures He gives you asparkplug acamera and abird call tape He will also tell you to get his cassette player from Em Go back to the house and change the time to A M again
Take Bird Pictures Go out the door in the kitchen area and go directly straight This is the forest If you need help navigating the forest you can use the map found in the kitchen Go forward and takeboard off a rock to the right Now let rsquo s take some pictures Explore the forest When you see a bird get out your camera and try to snap a picture If you succeed great job
But if the bird flies away then we will have to try back later hellip hmm hellip When you are in the forest take a picture of ablue bird ayellow bird and abrown bird If you have explored the whole forest you have seen a few other birds that have flown away from you Once you see a bird Nancy will mark its location on the map of the forest We should talk to Red about this and see what advice he has
Cemetery If you haven rsquo t found the cemetery yet you can follow the map found in the kitchen to the cemetery Zoom in on the first tombstone on the left it says WALDO This may come in handy later in the game Go forward and pick upboard Head over to the crypt and see the paw prints on the door Go inside and see a rock coffin Exit the forest and go back to the house
Fix the Rotten Floorboards Since we have found boards and have plenty of nails and a hammer let rsquo s try to fix the boards Head over the stairs and zoom in on the floor Lay the boards down and secure them with the nails and hammer Now you can go across them You can see the outline of a door hellip that rsquo s strange Change the time to P M and go talk to Red He will tell you that you need camouflage He recommends going to Em rsquo s Ask him about the water in Sally rsquo s well also It needs to be tested Red says to ask Jeff Akers the ranger for a kit Finally he says to look for the birds early in the morning Go back to the house and change the time to A M
Explore the Rest of Moon Lake Fix the Boat Wake up and head out to the motor boat Put the spark plug in the engine One the underside of the engine box lid there are some instructions
You need to tighten the screws according to the instructions Use to screwdriver to tighten or loosen the screws accordingly
top left top right bottom left bottom right That should do it Make sure you grab your lifejacket If you do not you will die Head over to Em rsquo s Emporium first Pull the line and the motor will start if you did it correctly
Em rsquo s Emporium Talk to Em about needing a chainsaw She says that she will call Tucker Davis but warns you that he will get around to it when he does Ask if she has Red Knott rsquo scassette player she will give it to you Ask her about the name Waldo Mathias and the cemetery and then ask her about her antiques Talk to Emily about the ranger too Finally tell her that you need some camouflage gear She says that she rsquo ll give you the gear in return for a dozen lsquo little critters rsquo She will give you aboxto put the critters in
Then ask her about the sandpaper as well We will have to ask Red for some sandpaper later While you rsquo re here you can look around if you want though there rsquo s not too much to look at Ranger Station Let rsquo s meet Ranger Akers Get back into the boat and head across the lake to the Ranger Station Talk to Jeff Akers completely He gives you awater testing kit He can mail your letter for you too Look around the ranger station and read everything that there is Let rsquo s head back to Sally rsquo s and test the water Testing the Water When you get back to the house go over to the water pump and put the wooden bucket down Oh no the water pump still doesn rsquo t work Try putting a little bit of water from the water bottle in the top of the pump maybe that will get things moving Put the wooden bucket down below the pump Sure enough it works so fill up a bucket of water and put some of it in the water testing container Be sure NOT to dump out the water Just leave the bucket there It may come in handy later
Ranger Station Go out to the boat and head out to the Ranger Station to return the water sample to Jeff Head back to Sally rsquo s place and take a quick rest But before that don rsquo t forget to listen to the bird calls Just get out the cassette player insert the tape and listen Now you can change the time to P M Talk to Red Knott Since Emily said that Red would have some sandpaper go see if he will let us borrow any Fortunately he gives us some Now let rsquo s go back to the house and see if this will help us move the Iggy statue
Dog Statues in Cabinet Now all you have to do is figure out is which way to move each statue You will have to use the poem and the clock Try moving each of the statues and seeing what picture shows up in the coo coo clock Each of the pictures that show up on the clock symbolize a different season So using the poem you can deduce that the spring birth date is the fresh spring leaves the summer is swans on shimmering blue the fall is autumn or deer and winter is birds take flight So every direction that one of the dogs in moved a different symbol appears in the space on the coo coo clock So if a dog is turned to the left the birds should show on the clock every direction has a corresponding image So using these guidelines the Vitus statue should be turned to the left Iggy turned forward Lucy turned right and Xander turned backwards
Hear a click and go towards the staircase Cross the broken floorboards and see that you can now open the door Using your flashlight go down the steps and turn left Take aframed pictureoff of the door and then continue on It looks like we are in a cellar now Turn left and hear squeaking Click on the square in the wall to reveal a piece of paper click again to reveal a safe It sounds like there are mice behind the safe Exit the room through a metal door Be sure to notice a newspaper article sitting on the steps about William Akers William Akers I wonder if he rsquo s related to Jeff Akers You should be outside now Let rsquo s go back into the house and change to time to morning There rsquo s nothing like a good night rsquo s sleep Wake up refreshed and ready to talk to Jeff Akers
Helping Out Ranger Station Get in the boat and motor on over to the Ranger Station Talk to Jeff about everything and meet his dog Yogi Show him the framed picture from the cellar He says he will do some research Offer to help him organize the filer by the computer If you need to brush up on Roman Numerals you can use the computer To access the Roman Numerals files click on History of Moon Lake then Creation of Moon Lake State Park then Roman Numerals You will arrange the files according to year in Roman Numerals The envelope with the earliest date goes in the front of each column Now organize the files by the chunks of years then by the exact years
Be sure to read MCMXLI MCMXXXII MCMXXV and MCMXCVII Then go check back with Ranger Akers He gives you aJr
Ranger pin That rsquo s all you get for the hard work
Exit the building and hop back into the boat
Sally rsquo s House Go back to Sally rsquo s and down to the cellar Use the end of the pin in the tiny hole in the safe Now all we need to do is figure out the combination The rest of previous combos written on the paper are dates of bad things so try the date of Malone rsquo s death He died on January So use the combination Each time that you rotate the dial to a different number click the button to the right The safe opens right up Oops you better not touch anything yet Remember Ranger Akers telling you about the nasty diseases the mice can carry hellip Use the gloves and mask to look through the journal Take themapof that says ldquo The dogs will lead the way rdquo Sounds like Jeff are related to William Akers after all Exit the cellar and head over to the Ranger Station
Ranger Station It turns out that Ranger Akers has been doing some research on our mystery woman Her name is Vivian Whitmore and she can be reached Talk to Jeff about thewater testing results Find out that the water contains high levels of arsenic Also ask him about the gold buried on Malone rsquo s property
Em rsquo s Emporium While you rsquo re out go and see what Emily is up to Talk to her about everything
Sally rsquo s House Go back to the house and call Sally Be sure to mention the contaminated water Talk to her completely
Bug Catching Time to get down and dirty Emily said that we needed to catch her critters Start in the day time You can catch up to critters during the day and you can find the rest during the night Be sure to check under every rock and tree you can find in the forest Be quick though the critters are fast Make sure that you look under the rock with the compass rose on it by the blue tarp You can also check under the rocks by the cemetery Once you have found bugs and have checked in the nighttime and daytime change the time back to A M and give the bugs to Em Take thecamo gearand go finish taking Red rsquo s pictures
Finish the Bird Pictures Head back to Sally rsquo s and enter the forest The map found in the kitchen should tell you where the birds are at Just go towards the ones you still need and snap a photo You should have pictures you should have a picture of the birds we were able to get without camouflage plus anorange bird and ared bird But we rsquo re still missing one the Red Tailed Hawk Go talk to Red about that Change the time to P M and visit him on his observing platform
Red Tailed Hawk Red Knott suggests looking in the big tree just southwest of Sally rsquo s house Change the time to A M and go check it out Well there isn rsquo t atreebut there used to be one All that rsquo s left is the tree stump Hear a Red Tailed Hawk in the distance look around and see one perched on the roof Quick take a picture Wait what is the hawk perched on Looks like a speaker hellip hmm hellip KLUNCK You are knocked out FIRE When yWhen you awake you find yourself in the burning shed You can hardly move because you rsquo re tied up but you can kick with your feet There are specific steps to getting out of the shed
First kick the gnome to land on top of the pump Kick the shovel that rsquo s standing to the in between the two shelves Then pump the pump in the corner that made Nancy cough earlier This should set the end of the shovel on fire Move the shovel back to its original position by clicking on it once Now you must click on the pump by the gnome twice to push a ball down the shelf and move the scythe to cut the ropes Now that you are out of the shed you should put the fire out Run over to the pump and pick up the bucket of water you left filled up Take it to the shed and splash it on Whew That was a close one See Red come by and talk to him He says that he needs to see you later tonight Finally talk to Sally on the telephone

The black squares are traps so don't go there or you lose
The winds can blow you to the trap so watch out where you land
The north wind can blow you down the east wind to the left the west wind to the right and the south wind to go up
My strategy was not to be blown to the far left squares and to stay on squares that the target wind cannot blow me away
ex above or below the east or west wind as my target or right or left of the north or south wind
Keep moving until the target wind is within or non black square then land on that target wind
Take the east wind first so there is no wind to blow you to the far left squares
Good luck

Included in the book is aslip of paperwith symbols forWater Earth Fire and Air Sitting on the chair is apuzzle box
It can be rotated to reveal five sides in all
Opening a side allows the player to change the backgroundcolor and the phase of the Moon
The moons on the coat of arms are part of the solution
Another clue is required to solve the box Atop the small bookcase is a pendulum toy
Unimportant just for fun Back away from the corner and this time turn right past the fireplace and the suitcase Look at the Window Seat
Down near the floor is a strange area
Wonder what goes there
Look further right and examine the Artwork above the table
Thestar chartsare given for the four primary seasonal turning points
Spring and Autumn equinox and Summer andWinter solstice Bruma
The last page contains thesame five animalsthat are found on the box
It shows Draco at the north Leo at the East Lepus at the South and Pisces at the west
Lynx is in the center
The puzzle box could be opened now if you like
Or you could wait until much later Lynx is new moon all vanes closed any color
The Rabbit South is green with the right half exposed The Dragon North is red fully open The Lion East is red with one vane obscuring the right edge The Fist West is blue with one vane obscuring the left edge The box pops open revealing a paper diagram of a telescope and a lens
Looking further to the right of the star charts is what appears to be aTelescope Tripod Further right is Nancy's bed with telephone andalarm clockon the side table
Continuing to the right is a large mural depicting a chariot pulled by four white horses Finally to the right of the mural is the exit to the hallway
Go into the hallway
As you pass Jane's room you can hear Jane with her tutor Emily Then as you pass Linda's room you overhear her in an angry phone call with her husband You can visit Linda and talk with her briefly but soon she clams up and refuses to say more Pick up on the clue that she is drowsy and her mouth is dry
Go down the staircase to the Main Hall
You should receive a phone call from Mrs Petrov After talking with her finish going down the stairs and turn left
The grey door leads to the Conservatory At the lower level you can examine an award from and theFountain which has no water in it Continue into the Conservatory and see the large carnivorous plant devour a hapless fly Talk with Mrs Drake
She certainly is no nonsense all right As you leave her look at the little table with seedlings and a wooden flat Examine the pill bottle She tells Nancy the medication makes her feel drifty and there are some precautions on the label
Go to the Library the large door opposite the Conservatory
Talk to Nigel Be sure to examine thestatue of Mercury in front of his desk There are other things to see in the Library but nothing important for now
In the Main Hall notice that the six columns each have alittle part missing Your primary quest in this game is to gain possession of those six items Also look at the various Coats of Arms
Each one has acharacteristic symbol such as snake rainbow lips lion whatever
Also notice that many of the Latin quotes are flanked by littlegraphical symbols Since they vary they must beimportant clues Make the connection between the pictures and the black symbols
Extra Any time you are in the Mail Hall you can play the quot Go Fish quot automaton game near the library
Until it gets disabled that is
It's a good idea to play it once so that you will recognize the symbols it uses
Let's see if Jane is done with her lessons
Maybe she will be willing to talk Jane wants to play a game
Refuse for now each game will come with a reward in time and there's no productive reason to play them yet
Look on the Window seat and find theFamily Tree You can ask Jane about the various family members helpful but it's not essential In the bookcase find the paper that deciphersRunes You can't take it with you so if you need to translate some Runes later on you might need to return here There is a book on Monsters
Read the book Important At the lower right of the last page click on the phone number forPaliki Vadas the author and presumedexpert on Lycanthropy
To the right of the bookcase is an area containing a toy oven and several ingredients Continue to the right and look on the dressing table There is a photo of Jane's quot real quot Mum Important Read the book quot Mutus Liber quot It contains valuable clues to the major tasks in the game Look to the right and examine thetapestryin the corner created by Charles in the 's Look to the right of the door on the desk
Find the lesson plans
Notice the time of day the lessons are conducted they end at p m Talk to Jane again
If you opened the puzzle box andhave the lens ask her about the telescope
She will return it if you play a game
This one's a jigsaw puzzle and it's timed five minutes
I suggest dragging most of the pieces out to the perimeter and begin with the corners and edges Once a piece is in the correct spot it locks in place
Finish the jigsaw in time and Jane promises to return the telescope
Several of the games that you play are quot rigged quot to get easier if you lose several times
To the best of my knowledge the Jigsaw is not one of these
You must simply solve it
Exit Jane's room and go left past the staircase to that strange object in the corner draped with a blanket Oooooooouuuuu
What in the world is that sound
Pull the blanket down to discover a Parrot in a cage Loulou will translate Latin to English but only once
Be choosy what you want translated
The more Latin phrases you have seen the more choices you will have
If you are curious about more Latin phrases you could save your game BEFORE ever asking Loulou to translate a phrase then replay it with different phrases
She will only give you one at a time
While you were out Jane returned the telescope
Go to your bedroom and look through the scope It seems to be looking at the mural with the horses Exit the view and put the eyepiece on the telescope
Aha
You seefive numbered items
Tragic Mask
Bird
Lyre
Doppelflaute two flutes
Comic MaskWrite that down intrepid detective the knowledge might just come in handy If you played the game in the Main Hall you recognize the items Whether or not you have played the game it will be disabled now that you have seen the clue
Back away from the telescope and the lens returns to inventory Check out the area under the Window Seat
Yes the lens fits into the round slot Give it a turn and Oh No
A puzzle is revealed with twelve Zodiac symbols If you need a nudge in the right direction use your phone to browse the web
Search for something about stars
Fortunately there is information on the Zodiac
Press the symbols in the same order as the web page gives starting with Aries and ending with Pisces
They are in the traditional sequence
Really can't figure it out Click here
Isn't that gorgeous
You have just solved the first of six major puzzles
You have theMoon Key
It's time for Nancy to have a good night's sleep
Click on the alarm clock then on the Alarm button Click on the Up arrow until a m appears then press the Set button Uh Oh
Nancy's dreams are interrupted by strange chanting If you look around you will not find much
It's a m Look in the hallway just in case
If you are strictly following this walkthrough you might just see a black robed figure disappearing down the hallway If you do examine and take the glasses
If she's not there now she will appear later You will be wanting to talk to Jane again and she will be occupied with lessons until p m Set the alarm clock for p m You might hear strange noises in the night
Go all the way down the hallway past the parrot cage turn right and knock on the door with the coat of arms It is locked and you need the key
Jane has it go ask her for the key
If the option to ask about the key does not appear let's do something else
Ask her if she wants to play a game
Looking in the Chest you can see several games Choose the one that looks like a small deck of cards near the back of the chest It's Concentration where you find and match pairs
I needed to use pencil and paper to beat this one since you must finish in tries or less
Fortunately the constellations all have names so you don't have to draw the pictures
Go to the Library and examine the computer in the far back of the room Go to Jane's room and ask her about the password
You will need to defeat her at quot Skull and Bones quot It's a quot Go Fish quot game
When you win you learn that the password is on Alan's coat of arms That's in the main hall the most recent one The Latin words are quot Purgamentum Exit quot Actually just purgamentum is enough That opens the computer and he tells you about the Ghost Hunt Not only must it be conducted late at night but it's timed Play it later
Important Use the Cell Phone to callPaliki Vadas the expert on Lycanthropy Then talk to Linda
Ask about secret passages and about Jane Now Jane will talk to you about secret passageways and the key
You will need to win another game Play BUL the ancient Mayan game
I remember playing this same game before Actually it was in Nancy Drew Secret of the Scarlet Hand She gives you the key to the East Hall
Enter the door in the East Hall
The secret passageway can be opened by correctly setting the hands on the dragon
The clue to the setting is the coat of arms on the door
Starting from the Dragon's head and zig zagging down toward the tail set the hands as shown here Right Up Down Left Down Right
When the settings are correct the dragon's eyes glow and he growls
It sounds more like an eighth grader belching when the teacher's back is turned than a dragon growling
Look in the passage discovering that it is too dark
You will need a source of light
Go to Jane and ask for a flashlight er torch
She doesn't have one but you can have a Glow Stick provided you can beat the previous high score of easy game or hard game
There's nothing easy about this game since it's tightly timed Don't dawdle staring at the puzzle if you don't see a good combination Shuffle Use that shuffle function agressively
That makes it relatively painless Look for the opportunity to create rows of four whenever possible
Remember to make four in a row you need to place two together leave a space place the third one beyond the space then the fourth one in between
Occasionally you can get five two space two and fill in that one for more extra time
Each time you go into the passageway guarded by the mechanical dragon you will need to re set the hands
It's not a maze just keep going all the way to the bottom and examine the puzzle on the doorway It depicts a word game and a parrot
It won't function until you trigger it Return upstairs and ask Loulou about it She wants the quot Magic Word quot Ask Mrs Drake about the magic word
quot Loulou is a very clever and beautiful bird quot Tell Loulou that and she gives you the word associated with a barber quot LEECH quot Go down into the secret passage again and change the tumblers so they spell LEECH
Now it says quot PICTURE quot Here you have a choice
You can go back to Loulou and ask for the next word Loulou is probably getting hungry and wants a quot cake quot Go to Jane's room and bake a cake
Be sure to use the cell phone first to search the web for nutritional requirements for parrots
There are some things that will harm the bird
I didn't make a 'bad' cake and feed it to Loulou but I suspect she will croak and Nancy will need a Second Chance
Anyway after feeding Loulou she will continue to cooperate providing the word associations However the Glow Stick has a limited life span and guess what
You will need to play that Petroglyph game again
And again
Fine if you enjoy that sort of thing
If you would rather cheat drag your cursor across the following box to highlight the answers Picture Book Baby Bonnet Hour Glass Ant Hill Once you solve all the words the door the puzzle is mounted on unlocks
Go inside only to find another puzzle
Half a puzzle that is The rest of it is on the other side of the door which you must access through another passageway altogether
Turn all the triangles right side up
There is nothing more to do here until you get to the other side
Back away turn around and go upstairs
In all likelihood the glow stick will expire on the way up
If it goes completely dark don't worry just continue until you come to the exit
You will probably encounter Ethel as you exit the room
Talk to her about all subjects
Go to Linda's room and talk to her about the passageways
She describes turning a gargoyle so she was referring to a different passage As you exit her room inspect the stone gargoyle in the corner of the hall
Try turning it Go to the Main Hall and find the portrait of Corbin Penvellyn
It's one without an accompanying coat of arms and depicts a gargoyle
Inspect it close up
Now you can go to the Library and ask Nigel for some information
He wants help typing and you must prove that you are fast enough
I think this is a fairly difficult test
You are still inside Nigel's Computer
Read his notes
Exit the laptop and take the paper he left for you depicting Corbin's coat of arms
It is the solution to opening the passage guarded by the gargoyle
You can always re enter his computer any time he is not in the Library
Exit the Library
Oh
You witness a strange ritual conducted by Ethel and Jane
They chant quot No key without toil no fire without oil quot Jane pours oil into the chamber underneath the floor
Time for bed
Set the alarm for something like a m and go into the hallway
You can overhear the lessons with Jane being a tad precocious
If you have not tried the automaton game in the Main Hall and found it disabled do it now Go to the conservatory and talk with Mrs Drake
She has the crank to the machine and will return it to you if you solve the problem she has with her little plants
There are many solutions here is one She will have gone to look for the crank when you finish you will need to depart and return to get it Look to the right beyond where she was standing
You will see a document on the small table Unfortunately it is guarded by a carnivorous plant
It won't eat one of Loulou's cakes but it's carnivorous remember
If you get something from the kitchen that has meat on the menu Nancy can take some of the meat with her and tame the plant
Now the document is available
Thanks Angi for the tip
Use the crank to activate the automaton game in the Main Hall
The game won't start until you select the correct five symbols and in the correct sequence
Melpomene
Erato
Terpsichore
Euterpe
Thalia Then press the red button to begin She wagers the Venus Key
Play the game to get the key
Before you can go into that other secret passage you will shudder need to win another glow stick Go see Jane and play that dratted game again
While you are there ask Jane about the ritual you observed
Seems like Jane finds it easy to be untruthful
Okay time to explore that other passage
Go to the Gargoyle in the hall and refresh your memory as to the method of turning it Start at the top
See the two comets
at the upper right that means turn the gargoyle right two times The whole sequence is Right Right Left Right Left Left Right
R L R L R Might as well write that down you will need it again
Enter the passage
Two or three steps in explore with the glow stick and find a large Scarab carving on the right
Look at it closely and it turns out to be a peephole into Linda's room
Eeek
Her hand is all hairy
Continue down the stairs
You find a door locked with a Runes Puzzle
Remember whose corridor this was
You need to spell out the name quot Elinor quot in the runes
Refer to your notes or refresh your memory by going to Jane's bedroom and review the sheet of Runes orClick Here for the solution Open the Runes door and continue to the bottom
At the bottom find the other side of the triangles Fire Symbol puzzle
Turn them all upright
Unfortunately this seems to rotate some of the ones on the back side of the door making it necessary to climb up to the hallway go into the East Hall turn the dragon's hands and return to the bottom of the original passage
Fix the triangles again and the door unlocks
Wow
Finally you have a permanent source of light
Here's some help graciously provided by Christy
Thanks Christy
She writes quot In the moving rooms on the way to the alchemy room If you go through the Mars door when you open it and then open and close the moon door once open it again and you see a pedestal in the middle of the room It almost looks like a bird bath if you collect the item from the center of it its a map of the revolving rooms and you are shown on it as a red dot It shows you when the path is clear to get to wherever you need to go The devil pictures are the traps the triangle is the way back to the tunnels to get out and the Angel symbol is the way to the alchemy lab quot You can wander through the maze and check the map device in your inventory each time you change rooms or make them rotate without entering
The red dot you is updated each time the rooms turn
This is what the maze map looks like when you first find it
What it doesn't show are all the potential symbols
The Moon room is obviously the center of the maze since that's where you are standing when you find this thing
The Angel is the alchemy room where you want to go
The Mercury symbol is the room that connects to the outside The first door you come to has the Mars symbol on it
Do this Click once on the door to open it but DO NOT enter the room Close the doorby clicking on either the far right or far left edge
It rotates Open the Mars door again and again DO NOT enter close it again Now turn around
You should see the Mercury door on the far side of the room
Open the Mercury door and enter the room
You find another puzzle lock on the next door The symbols are from the science of Alchemy
Important Click on the circular snake symbol at the top center of the puzzle
You will need to enable this puzzle by talking to Nigel and learning about Alchemy from the Web
Go to the Library ask Nigel about the snake Ouroboros actuallyOuroboros then browse the web to get the meaning of the symbols
Careful
To exit efficiently use the same process Open and closethe Mars door TWICE without stepping through it
Turn around and exit through the Mercury door into the passage
If you find yourself in another room instead it's easier to revert to a saved game than to negotiate the maze
It's possible to get hopelessly lost in the rotating rooms
Ask me how I know
You need to return downstairs to the Alchemy puzzle
The symbol at the lower right suggests that you are to create some Aqua Fortis
The button and the empty squares above that suggest that this is the first of five recipes you will need to accomplish
The twelve buttons on the left are the ingredients to be chosen and the cauldron at the bottom center is where they will be mixed together
Use the cell phone to learn the symbols and formulae
If you aren't into solving it yourself click here to see the solutions You will be making Aqua Fortis Aqua Regia Mercury Distilled Vinegar and Liquor Hepatis
You have entered the Alchemy Laboratory
Straight ahead is the Forge
You will eventually get it going by providing Air Water and Oil
That comes later
To the left are some pieces of lab equipment and to the right is a work table
Go to the table
You can see two documents one on the left is a page from a journal and on the right is a letter from Penelope Penvellyn
Read them both
Between the documents are two books
The book in front describes Aeolus the god of winds
Read how he captures the four winds
Especially read how he is strong and can lift heavy things
Keep that in mind for much later
Important Find and read the book behind the first one
It is dark in the lab and it would be easy to miss seeing that book
Read the clues There is a key hidden in the Singing Stairs
Also a devious lock will restore water to the well
Thomas Mercury's Wand can be released by moving the hands that protect the house
Elinor Tame the Master Gargoyle and his two companions with the wand and apply the wand to the depository C Playful device hides Venus' arrowhead and Aeolus puzzle is in this room Penny Telescope lens etc
Brigitte A passage hides its key behind a target Edward Help the frog cross the pond John The computer will help find the Saturn Key and the clue to cutting through the rotating rooms
Alan Finally there is another scrap of a document on the shelf above the table
Unimportant
You can examine the Forge if you like quot Looks like a Forge Looks like a chunk of metal Looks like some kind of ancient mold
If you looked at the mold it went into your inventory
Keep it it's for the very end of the game To the left of the Forge is a work area
Find the scrap of paper on the grindstone and another set of two papers and a book on the little table
Important Look at the second paper hidden behind the first one
It contains a clue to the Mercury Statue's controls
Did you see Aeolus the big metal dude in the opposite corner
From the work area turn further left
See the keyhole in the wall then the niche containing the Aeolus Puzzle
Press the blue button to begin the challenge
The object is to maneuver Aeolus in such a way as to capture each of the four winds and avoid either stepping into a pit or being blown into a pit by one of the winds
The direction arrows let you move either one space or two
Nancy may comment that quot Some winds are stronger than others quot You should plan on getting to the top row and capture the North Wind from above
Try to remain in the second and fourth columns so the South Wind can't blow you into a pit
Go for the East and West Winds saving the South for last
You will be able to come down the fourth row using one and two step moves until you can get onto the bottom row making the South Wind available for capture
Catching all four winds will supply air to the Forge
Exit the Lab
Remember Mars Door twice then turn around and exit via the Mercury door
Immediately go left and ahead to find the lock to the Well Room
You are trying to create a group of four
Use the yellow buttons to select and transfer the units of water between panels
Call the unit panel quot quot the middle panel quot quot and the unit panel quot quot Click on them in this order Water is not only supplied to the Forge but guess what
Also to the frog pond in the Conservatory Go back to the entrance of the Rotating rooms and standing with your back to the door go forward once
You should find a place where you can go either left or right
Go right
This takes you up toward the Upper Hall
Partway up find a landing where you can either go right to a rising staircase or straight ahead to a new doorway
Go that way to find the puzzle that controls the Mercury Statue
Looks like gloves from a suit of armor
Try the pink crystalline button at the center
It should be extended glowing not pushed in dark
Then click on the index finger of the right hand
That's the hand at the left side of the screen
You should hear Nigel say something
Then click on the middle finger of the left hand
The hand at the right side of the screen
Nigel screams
The Mercury statue has rotated
Continue up the stairs and exit into the hallway
The cell phone may ring and it's Ned
Talk with him about everything
He suggests the coats of arms images and symbols are important clues
Let's go to the Library and check out the Mercury Statue
Sure enough it has turned
Now you can take theMercury Wandfrom his grasp
That's the third key three more to go
Did we refuse to play the Ghost Hunt with Alan's computer before
Maybe this is a good time to do that
Open the old computer again the password is purgamentum and accept the offer to play the game
Whoops if it's not after midnight the ghosts won't appear
How about going to the Conservatory instead
I suggest the route shown here to get the Frog to the Princess
You may get ambushed by an alligator and you may not but keep trying this path and it will work
No Prince Charming sorry but you do get the Mars Key
Go upstairs into the upper hall
Find the staircase between Jane's room and your room
As you climb each step makes a unique sound
According to the captions they are in order Bling Whoop Waah BlaDing Whoop Waah Bang Bang
That's five different sounds for eight steps
At the top you discover a set of seven levers
Pulling the levers reveals that the first five are the sounds you heard and the last two are not part of the staircase sequence
You need to pull the levers in the same order that the sounds appeared
This is the solution B A D C A D E E
The panel opens
Take the key
When you reach the bottom of the steps you might overhear Mrs Drake talking to Linda and watch her place some sort of Charm over Linda's door
You have just acquired a key
Wonder where it goes
Try it in the keyhole next to Jane's door
It fits alright but need lubrication
Go to your bedroom and use the house phone to call the Cook
Egad
He speaks Cockney
What's that all about
Order something and be sure to ask for Uncle Fred and Johnny Rutter Bread and Butter
If the Cockney jargon gets too confusing you can go to Mrs Drake and ask for some clarification
Then a website will be available on the cell phone
You need to leave your room anyway so they can deliver the meal
If you haven't talked to Jane in a while do that
She shows you a dire message and talks about her lack of trust in anyone
If you return to your bedroom the food will be there
Eat the meal and be sure to take the butter with you
Return to the hallway and use the butter to lubricate the keyhole
Now the key will work and what happens
Some wooden beams slide out allowing you to see the panel above the door
The Latin says quot Ludes ergo es quot I suspect that is a play on words
Remember quot Cogito ergo sum quot I think therefore I am
This would say roughly quot You play therefore you are quot Good philosophy for an adventure gamer
Anyhow what you have here is simple in appearance but it's a slider puzzle and the only one I have not been able to solve
I cannot give you a solution rather I can provide a way to beat it
First of all the sequence is suggested by the Tapestry in Jane's room
Looking at the tiles start at the bottom left and proceed across the top then down to the right Call them Charity Sun Moon Strength Father Time Toast Folly Angel Geometer Knight It's your job to arrange them in the order found in the tapestry Maybe somebody can solve this one legitimately but here's what you have to do Move a tile or two then give up and back away
Restart the puzzle
Repeat several times Be on the lookout for a new arrangement of the tiles which is almost perfect except for two tiles Then it's easy to switch those two and claim the prize
Watch for this arrangement
One time it appeared after eight repetitions another after ten another time after eleven
Keep your eyes open
In this case only the juggler and the compass need to be interchanged
Not tricky just move Father Time up Compass up Juggler right and down Compass down and left and Father Time down
You receive the Jupiter key a lightning bolt
We should find out what time it is
Go to Nancy's room and set the clock for the middle of the night something like a m You might witness a nightmare depending on which night this is
If you do the time is reset to a m and it's a good time to go on the ghost hunt as suggested by the computer in the Library
If you don't get the nightmare and it's still the middle of the night do the ghost thing If Nancy whinesabout needing some sleep set the clock for the next day then set it again for the following early a m Give the computer the password purgamentum
Tell it you're ready for the hunt
Don't get fooled into giving the computer the password as you back away just back away and go look for ghosts
Ghost locations Main Hall Lower Hall Upper Hall top of noisy stairs Conservatory
The ones in the Main Hall are found by the right hand entrance to the lower hall at the foot of the stairs at the base of a column near the Conservatory and next to the Library door
I suggest the following sequence because the puzzle is tightly timed and you must finish at the computer

Main Hall by the entrance to Lower Hall
All three in the lower hall
They are somewhat hard to see
Go to the ends and turn around
Start with the right end and exit the other side
Main Hall foot of stairs
All three in the Upper Hall
Start with the one near the East Hall around the corner from Loulou l
Top of the blinging stairs
Two in the Conservatory
Go downstairs first see the one on the Award
Go upstairs and see the one next to the exit
Main hall base of column and Library door
The computer suggested something about the Green Dragon
Go to the East Hall and turn left upon entering
Press the hotspot on the right side of the shelf
A panel opens and Whee
You can slide down to the Main Hall
Expect a nasty confrontation with Ethel when you arrive at the bottom
You saw a Bulls Eye target on the way down
You need to throw an object at the target
Feeling stuck
Can't figure out what to throw
If there was ever a legitimate clue I missed it
I just had to ransack the house until I found it and that took a while believe me Click here to find out what you are looking for
Edit a reader named Christy found the clue
After you have gone down the slide once talk to Loulou
She will tell you what to do
Thanks again Christy
If you find it difficult to hit the target don't fret just keep repeating the slide
It will automatically work on the th or th try
You have the Saturn Key
If you're following the sequence of this walkthrough then that's the sixth and final key
Time to put them to use
Do you remember where there are some things missing
In six places that is
That's right the six columns in the Main Hall each have a part missing
Using the keys open each column and rotate the pipes to form a large rectangle
The corners are obvious the middle one near the Library Jupiter should be turned so the pipe connects with the center and the middle column near the Conservatory should be turned so it connects with the Oil Reservoir
Then having restored Oil to the Forge it must be lighted
The clue to this comes from Corbin's instructions found in the Lab
He said something like quot Tame the Master Gargoyle and his two companions with the wand and apply the wand to the depository quot Here's what to do
Go to the Master Gargoyle
That's the one upstairs between Jane's and Linda's rooms
Go close to it and wave the Mercury Wand over its head until you see its eyes glow red
Go next to the gargoyle in the East Hall turn right upon entering the room and wave the wand causing its eyes to glow
Here's the trick turn around and open the panel and slide down to the Main Hall
If you don't use the slide the time will run out
As you hit the bottom turn left and wave the wand at the third gargoyle
As soon as its eyes glow go to the center of the room and looking down wave the wand at the hole where Jane poured the oil
If you are fast enough the forge will be operational
Make your way down into the Alchemy Lab once more
Use either the Dragon entrance or the Gargoyle entrance it doesn't matter
If you didn't take the Key Mold from the forge before do it now and look at it close up in inventory
You must set each segment according to the following instructions
The clues came from the various coats of arms and the little symbols flanking the Latin texts
Additional help came from the Mutus Liber
Set the bars correctly on the mold and go to the Forge clicking on the quot Wow Molten Metal quot If the mold is correct Nancy says it looks right
Take the key
Insert it into the keyhole on the left wall
Guess what
Little Miss Nasty Pants shows up and takes the Meteorite causing the trap to fall
Nancy better step back before she too is trapped
Now it's time to save the little pain in the butt
Go to the Aeolus puzzle and use the arrows to maneuver him to the big box on the left
He lifts it and all is saved
Well done Detective Drew

This is a random puzzle
To play move a colored ball in the bottom row to a tee in the first column on the left
Do this to all tees
Then push the golf club button at lower right to see how you guessed
If a stick with a flag is seen it means one of the balls in the column is in the correct order and correct color
If only a stick is seen it means one of the balls in the column has correct color but in the wrong position
If no stick is seen it means one of the balls does not belong
The order of the clues is not correlated with the solution
From here on logic prevails
You can deduce the correct color and position in subsequent columns
The ball can be replaced by another one by clicking it on another colored ball before clicking the golf club

Nancy Drew Danger by Design A Walkthrough by Zurreen Zubairie Copyright All rights reserved
Please note that this walkthrough is copyrighted Hence anyattempt to reproduceanythingfrom this walkthrough will beseverelypunished to themaximumextent of the law
The Walkthrough This is Nancy Drew's Case It is actually a very easy game and I would encourage you to try to solve as many puzzles as you can on your own For this reason I have tried to write the following walkthrough so that you can find the answer to a question without quot accidentally discovering quot the answer to another that you might have preferred to find yourself
Although Nancy Drew games are supposed to be for mystery fans aged and up they are actually a lot of fun for any age group Unlike many games these days however the Nancy Drew games providecleanfun What's more some of the puzzles can be quite challenging The only complaint that I have with these games is that you cannot skip any cutscene or dialog This is especially annoying when you are trying out the different options in a conversation to see if you can discover some new information Thankfully though in most of the Nancy Drew games ndash and certainly in this one ndash you tend to get all the critical information you need no matter what option you select In other words you will not get stuck because you made the quot wrong quot choice in a given conversation
Please note that this is a non linear game In other words you can do the tasks in any order you like There are some tasks that have to be done before others of course For example you might be able to call someone only after the game indicates the need to do so But you will not be penalized for taking your time to complete any task In this connection please note the day changes in this game This change has nothing to do with the tasks you complete Rather there seems to be a clock running in the background even though you will not see it until the day is about to change Please also note that you will be notified of the change only when you try to go from one location to another on the map Nancy will tell us that it is getting late and will rush back to her apartment You will then get a screen saying quot Day quot quot Day quot etc Just click on the screen to begin that day If you were in the middle of an errand and the day ends don't worry about it As I indicated you will not be penalized for taking your time to finish a task even if someone has told you to get it done right away You can always finish the next day
Well that is all I can think of in terms of a general guide to the game Following is a more detailed step by step walkthrough Please feel free to address any comments or questions about this walkthrough toZSZUBAIRIE AOL com
This game begins a little differently than the thirteen Nancy Drew games before it We still don't get to see Nancy but we do get a glimpse of her room The opening leaves us facing her desk Feel free to refer to the quot Dossier quot the brown book standing in the upper left portion of the desk which lists all the Nancy Drew games before this one Click on any case you like to see its synopsis The book on quot How to be a Detective quot in the lower left portion of the desk tells you all about playing this game Finally the quot Case File quot in the center of the desk gives a synopsis of the present case In fact you can refer to this quot Case File quot even during the game Just look it up in your inventory after the game begins
When you are ready to play the game click on the airplane ticket which is lying on your right You will be asked if you would like to start the game Answer quot Yes quot You will then be asked if you would like to play as a Junior or Senior Detective Choose as you wish Note the following walkthrough is written for the Senior Detectives But that should not be a problem for those playing as Junior Detectives of course because the game provides them with more clues and easier puzzles anyway

Conduct the conversation as you wish As it turns out we will have to make the four prints ourselves to complete this errand for Minette Dieter tells us to refer to the binder on a bookshelf for instructions There is only one bookshelf in the room the one with the aquarium on your right So close up on the aquarium and pick up the binder which is propped up against the side of the bookshelf on your right Flip through the pages to read the instructions A dialog will follow Turn around and approach the door with the red light at its top Dieter will warn you not to spill any chemicals while working inside Enter the Dark Room which is really a bathroom that has been converted into a dark room Turn right to face the actual developing area
Developing the Prints This is actually a very tricky puzzle The instructions dictated that we turn off the lights before doing any real developing work But you will soon discover that working in the dark is the tricky part You have to remove the paper from the enlarger and put it in three trays one by one The hand icon can be misleading and if you don't click exactly where you are supposed to you will spill the chemicals from the trays and it's Game Over You can go back to an earlier save or use the quot Second Chance quot option in the main menu of course But that just means you will have to start the puzzle all over again In short it can all be quite tricky indeed Well one tricky deed deserves another right So here ismytricky solution to this tricky puzzle
The Tricky Solution Before you turn off the lights take a sheet ofPOST ITsticky paper Cut out a strip of paper from the top the actual sticky portion of the paper Cut this strip intofourpieces Each piece should be small enough tocoverthe hand icon that appears only over the negatives right now Stick these piecesdirectly on your monitorover the switch at the base of the enlarger and in the center of each of the three trays as shown by the little round yellow circles in the picture below Now you know exactly where to click your cursor the hand icon even in the dark
Note Do be sure to use thePOST ITstick notes for this purpose or something very much like it Using anything else might leave a sticky residue on your monitor of course and it can be a pain to clean up afterwards
Having done all this quot preparatory quot work follow the steps below
Pick up a negative from the tray at the bottom and put it in the top left portion of the enlarger on your left
Turn off the Light Switch on your right
Turn on the Enlarger Switch in the lower left portion of your screen We need to wait seconds Remember the old trick it takesone secondto say quot one thousand one quot Keep your cursor in the same place as you count the seconds by saying quot one thousand one one thousand two quot etc Give it secondsbecause you don't want to go under or above the time limit in case you might be counting too fast or too slowly Note Don't be distracted if Dieter makes a comment in the background possibly at the beginning of your work
Click on the quot Enlarger Switch quot again to pick up the paper
Put the paper in the Red Tray We need to wait secondsfor this one Again keep the cursor in the same place as you count the seconds as before quot one thousand one one thousand two quot etc Give it seconds
Pick up the paper and put it in the White Tray We should wait quot no more than seconds quot this time Give it seconds
Pick up the paper and put it in the Blue Tray We must now wait seconds Give it seconds
Pick up the paper Nancy should announce that it is done the lights should come on and Nancy should be holding a picture
Click on the hand icon on the picture to step out of the close up You should see the picture now hanging on the line above the trays The space in the tray from where you had first picked up the negative should still be empty Pick up adifferentnegative and put it in the enlarger step Note that doing so will put the first negative back in its original position in the tray holding all the negatives
Repeat the above steps to develop the second picture Develop the last two pictures in the same way As the last picture comes out Nancy will indicate that we are done and the game will bring you out of the dark room automatically
Turn left and talk to Dieter now Proceed as you wish Then step out of the studio and go to the park at Pont Neuf
PONT NEUF the flea market Note that there are only three merchants in the park two women and a man Feel free to haggle with them if you like but be sure to save your game before you start haggling because you get only one chance to make an offer and if you offer too little the merchant will stick with his or her highest price As you examine the items offered by the merchants keep in mind that Minette likes round and curved objects as Heather had told us and as you yourself might have noticed in Minette's studio Following is a list of items you need to purchase the merchants that offer them and the lowest price at which you can get them
Malika the veiled lady on your left as you enter the park Green Rings for euros Monique the young lady on the other end as you turn right from Malika Traffic Cone for euro Lava Lamp for euros M Marchand the male vendor in the very center of the park As you try to step out of the close up after purchasing the canister the merchant will offer you a chance to make money by painting some pictures for him Feel free to take him up on that offer You will get euros for the first painting that of a woman After paying you for it the merchant will ask you if you would like to do another painting If you decide to continue you will then get a choice of two paintings that of the woman for euros again or a flower vase which is more complicated and thus gets you euros While all this painting work is rather straightforward the following hints might be helpful
After you have purchased the above items for Minette and done the painting work if any for M Marchand leave the park and go to the hotel
HOTEL DE VILLE Cafe Kiki Step forward and talk to Jean Michel Traquenard we will call him Jean Mi from now on During the conversation he will insist that you order some food i e at his expense Pick up the menu and order anything you like You can order only one item of course If you would like to try out the other items for example to see what the French names stand for in English save your game before you order and then replay this portion of the game trying the items one by one Then continue the conversation with Jean Mi Be sure to ask him about Hugo Butterly and he will give you that man's phone number You don't have to jot down the number yourself however because it will appear automatically at the bottom of the screen i e in your directory whenever you pick up a phone When you finish your conversation with Jean Mi the game will bring you back to the map automatically Go and check out J J Ling the lady with whom you are supposed to be staying during this trip

Note Be sure to refer to the bookbeforeyou start adding the ingredients to the mixing bowl There seems to be some kind of a bug here in the game So if you refer to the book after you have already added some ingredients the cookies won't come out right apparently because the ingredients added before reading the book are lost and the game proceeds as if they had never been added
Making the Cookies Feel free to use your French English dictionary to translate the French terms Then add the following to the mixing bowl
cubes of Butter quot beurre quot cup White Sugar quot sucre quot cup White Sugar teaspoon Molasses substitute for brown sugar Eggs teaspoon Vanilla quot vanille quot cups all purpose flour quot farine quot teaspoon Baking Soda quot bicarbonate desoude quot to the left of salt teaspoon salt quot sel quot sprig of fresh finely chopped Mint cup Semisweet Chocolate Chips packet of quot morceauxduchocolat quot on your left After adding these ingredients to the mixing bowl click on the baking sheet left of the mixing bowl and a cutscene will follow If you have added everything correctly this cutscene will show the cookies flatten out and Nancy will note how their edges have turned up Step out of the close up and you will hear the phone ring Answer the phone on your right to find that it is J J asking about the cookies Nancy will tell her about the edges of the cookies curling up

Turn right to your computer Pick up and read the pink note hanging down from the shelf left of the computer It is a note from Heather asking you to pick up a stuffed parrot fromPont Neuf So go to the park now

RUE DU BAC the secret passage As you enter Nancy will note that someone is in the dark room Go there and knock on the door A dialog will follow Turn around and step towards the bookcase Instead of closing up on it however step just to the right of it ndash towards the panel with the hole in it Attach the clock you had picked up in the park to this hole to start a timed puzzle
The Clock Puzzle The puzzle is timed but don't worry You will have more than enough time to solve it As we noted earlier the quot quot in the clock we found in the park was circled This is a clue to the fact that we mustset each of the nine clocks in the panel at o'clock This can be tricky however because setting the time in one clock changes the settings in other clocks
Thus we need to be careful in choosing the clocks we set so that we can set all the clocksat before we run out of the allotted time Set the clocks in the following order
Note that you need to set only the clocks shown in the orange boxes in the above diagram By the time you finish setting these clocks in the indicated order the clocks shown in the gray boxes will be automatically set at the correct time as well
As you finish a cutscene and a dialog will follow Step inside the passageway Close up on the spider on your right Step out of the close up and proceed forward in the passageway You will find a wall safe at the end of the passage Open the cover Nancy will translate the French inscription Recall the dates we noted on the cross at Pont Neuf The quot quot stands for of course So click in and the safe will open

The Cockroaches You must catchninebugs in all As soon as you catch one it will be deposited in one of the empty spaces in the box I am afraid no walkthrough can help you catch the bugs It all depends on how quickly you can click your mouse button at the right spot at the right time So the best that I can do is to give you an idea of where to find the bugs Don't worry Sooner or later youwillget all of them

Now put J J 's quot autograph quot in the skull Note The piece of paper will actually go into the skull's eye So I like to take these pictures first just in case that paper sticking out of the skull's eye might make these pictures quot unacceptable quot to Dieter
Go back to J J 's place
PLACE MONGE Zu's information Call Zu After the conversation go to the park
PONT NEUF Wetsuit amp M Go to Marchand in the center of the park Buy theWETSUITfor euros
Note You can also buy the book of quot Common Codes and Deciphers quot for eurosat this time but I would advise against it There is some kind of a bug later in the game as explained in the next section in this walkthrough The problemiseasily solved but you can avoid all the hassle if you just buy this book later You don't need it yet anyway
Try to buy theM decoder from Marchand but he will not sell it He does agree to let you have it however if you get him a bottle ofMouton Fouette Go to the catacombs
DENFERT ROCHEREAU The Tunnels Approach the skull and click on its top to remove it Click on the red button An opening will appear on your right Go through that opening to arrive in a dark chamber Move forward and step out of this chamber to arrive in what we will call the Central Hall As you move further you will hear the police in the background as the words quot Police approach quot will appear at the bottom of the screen Turn around and go back into the dark chamber all the way to the door Don't step out though Rather as you reach the door just turn around and the police voices should stop immediately At that point go back out into the Central Hall cross the plank in front of you and turn right Takefoursteps forward turn left and enter a chamber with a pool of water in it Go forward and into the water Nancy will comment
Note Nancy leaves her inventory by the quot pool quot before she steps into the water In other words you will not have access to your inventory until you return to this point But don't worry You have everything you will need
Move forward in the water You will see the number marked in front of you and the only way forward is down Note that any time you spend underwater is timed In other words you must move fast or Nancy will lose her breath and it will be Game Over It would therefore be a good idea to at least skim through each underwater section in the walkthrough before you dive to get an idea of what you need to do below and thus to save yourself some time
Note In the following directions quot F quot means take a step forward quot F quot means take steps forward etc
MoutonFouette Down F Right F Right F
Pick up the bottle of quot MoutonFouette quot Turn around take stepsforwardand comeUPto breathe at number
The Hazelnut quot Noisette quot Down Left F Left F Left F Right F Right F Left F Right F Left F Left F Right F which will automatically bring you up stopping the timer
The Tunnels Safe Go up the ladder in front of you Move forward towards the wall safe Open the cover and close up Nancy will translate the French words but the clue actually lies in the French words themselves Recall that the letter inNoisette'sred diary that you had found in the secret passage in Dieter's place had mentioned devising a code using the Metro route names and numbers The code used in this puzzle is just such a code
Note the four colored French words phrases written in capital on the safe cover Does the word quot PONT NEUF quot at least ring a bell Unfortunately we can't access the map from here But if you go back to an earlier Save and check out the map you will find that each of these words phrases on the safe is the name of a metro stop Indeed the color of the words on the safe is the same as the color of the names of those stops in the map See picture below
The trick to cracking this code is to determine the number in the map for each colored word phrase on the safe and then click in the numbers in the same order as the corresponding word appears on the safe Thus EUROPE PONT NEUF BLANCHE CHATEAU ROUGE So click in and the safe will open
Pick up the object inside Nancy will comment Click on the object again to deposit itsomewhere since you don't have your inventory with you Turn around and go to the manhole Step in to get back on the ladder Takefoursteps down the ladder to reach the last dry point on the ladder before you go underwater again

Go forward and come back up on the landing Try to pick up your inventory from the floor on your left A cutscene follows And I thought this game was for girls who weren't afraid of rats hellip Click on the hand icon and you will be able to pick up the inventory this time
Note I have played this portion several times and only once did the rat take the code book So it doesn't happen often apparently The one time that it did Nancy noted that she was missing the code book I couldn't find the book anywhere in the tunnels I returned toMarchandin the park I couldn't see the code book on his table but a hand icon appeared in the empty space where I had first bought that code book from him I clicked on that icon and was thus able to buy the book once again but had to pay the full price euros this time The fact that I couldn't see the book on his table though indicates that there is some bug in this portion of the game
Step out of this chamber turn right and take four steps forward Turn left cross the plank and go into the dark chamber Step through the door to return to the outer chamber the one with the skull Leave the catacombs and head for Dieter's place
RUE DU BAC Finishing up the Photo Assignment If you have taken the six pictures shown earlier in this walkthrough you will find Dieter back at his desk Approach him and a dialog will follow Pick either response to have Nancy give him the camera and the dialog will continue
Note Dieter will end the conversation after you have exhausted the topic onNoisette So be sure to cover the other two topics before asking him about her
As you start talking aboutNoisette Dieter will show you a card with a lot of eyes on it We will therefore call it the Eyes card
Click on the card to turn it over and continue the conversation
Message on the Eyes card After the conversation bring out the Eyes card from your inventory
Click on the card to turn it over to the side with all the eyes on it
With the card still on the screen bring out the grid that you had removed from Noisette's red diary when you first found that diary in the secret passage at Dieter's place from the inventory Place the grid on the Eyes card
Recall what Lynn Manrique had told you Noisette was saying over and over before she passed away quot RED LEFT hellip GREEN quot Note the color of the pupils on the eyes in the Eyes card red green or gray Note also the different positions of these pupils some are to the left some are in the middle and some are to the right in their eye sockets Click on thefiveeyes that have RED pupils in the LEFT portion of the eyes Then click on thefiveeyes that have a GREEN pupil regardless of their position in the eye sockets If you click correctly Nancy will read the following message that has appeared at the bottom of the Eyes card SousLorraine Note quot sous quot is French for quot under quot Step out of the close up and go to the park
PONT NEUF the park exhibits Step forward towards the Lorraine cross Close up on the top of the cross and then on the inscription Note the date Click only on the numbers that the message on the Eyes card had revealed The cover below the date will drop showing the order in which we must attempt the exhibit puzzles and the results we must achieve in the first two puzzles
The Mouth Puzzle Step out of the close ups on the cross Turn left and step towards Malika Instead of closing up on her however turn right take two steps and close up on the Mouths puzzle on your left
ClickTEN timeson the white handle on your right
The mouths should quot say quot the following at the bottom of the screen Top Mouth EEEEE Middle Mouth AHHHH Bottom Mouth OOOOO Step out of the close up and if you have clicked correctly the mouths willnotreset Otherwise they will resume their original closed position and you will hear a sound in the background like someone sticking out their tongue at you
If that happens try the puzzle again When done turn around and take three steps to reach what Nancy calls quot the Windmill quot The Windmill Puzzle Click once on the white handle on your right Turn around Nancy will comment and a cutscene will follow Step towards the windmill again and click on the red magnifying glass icon left of the exhibit Nancy will tell us that we need to put something there to scare that squirrel away
We will have to buy a few things for this purpose While we are at it let's also buy some other things that we will need too soon enough So make your purchases as follows
Go toMarchand Nancy will automatically give him the bottle of Mouton Fouette and get the Decoder in return just as he had promised earlier Purchase thePIE TINfor euro Note If the rat stole your code book in the catacombs tunnels be sure to buy that as well from Marchand by clicking on the hand icon in the empty space in the lower left corner of the table and paying the full euros As noted earlier you will not be able to bargain this time
Go toMalikathen and purchase the following items
STAKE for euros
STRING for euros
quot ICHIDO quot book for euros
Finally go toMoniqueand purchase theFLASHLIGHTfor euros
Turn around and return to the Windmill exhibit now on your left Close up on the exhibit
Bring out theStake then theString and finally thePie Tinfrom your inventory and place them one by one in the space left of the exhibit where the red magnifying glass icon appears The squirrel will not bother us anymore So Click on the white handle on the right of the exhibitsix times
If you have done it correctly the petal at the top should now be technically it islavender but some people call it purple i e the same color as that of the top petal shown in the clues we got earlier from the Lorraine cross
The Fish Fountain Turn around and go to what I call the Fish Fountain now on your left Close up on that exhibit and press the red button on your right A cutscene will show a grate opening under the fish Step inside
The Park Passage Go down the ladder Turn around step forward and go down the second ladder Turn around and go through the passage Since you have already bought the flashlight you will not have any problems Nancy will merely note that it is time to get out the flashlight but you won't have to bring the flashlight out of the inventory yourself because it will come out automatically A cutscene will then take you through the passage
Caution This is a very poorly structured cutscene I think because it is likely to make some perhaps even most gamers rather dizzy from the way it goes winding left and right through the underground tunnel For those of you that find it unsettling my advice is to just close your eyes and wait for the sound of a click that will indicate that Nancy has put away the flashlight Open your eyes at that point and proceed as follows
Approach the chest in front of you Open it and retrieve the Key Step out of the close up turn around and go back into the tunnel A cutscene will take you back to the beginning of the passage Once again close your eyes if you find the cutscene unsettling Open your eyes only when you hear that clicking sound that indicates Nancy has put away the flashlight Then proceed as follows
Step forward and go up the ladder Step forward again and go up the second ladder Click on the grate above to open it and then step outside Go to Minette's place
ABBESSES The Final Visit Go to your desk If you had told Minette about Heather the fact that Heather had written at least one of those threatening letters you will find a lavender note to the right of your computer Read it Nancy will comment
Feel free to call Lynn Manrique Exhaust both topics of the conversation
Now go to the door to Minette's studio butDON'T OPEN IT Otherwise it will be game over and you will have to avail the Second Chance from the main menu
Instead close up on the mechanical gadget above the door handle on your right A dialog will follow Be sure to SAVE your game here because a timed puzzle is about to follow Don't worry though you will have more than enough time to finish the puzzle if you follow the directions below
Defusing the Bomb Open the cover Another dialog will follow as the timed puzzle begins Don'tpay any attention to Minette's periodic interruptions They are meant to only distract you and thus to make the puzzle a bit harder Nancy will answer her for you The good thing though is that you will be able to continue working through the dialog unlike some other places in the game where you have to wait for Nancy to finish her comment before you can use the controls
As you open the cover note the little black and white diagram on the inside of the cover to the left of the fuse panel Blackened O O check mark i e is OK Blackened O Blackened Triangle check mark i e is OK Blackened O Triangle cross i e is NOT OK The upshot of these cryptic instructions is that it isOKAYto put together two fuses with thesame symbol even if the color of those two symbols is different Thus for example it is okay to put a fuse with a red circle in line with a fuse with a yellow circle
It is alsoOKAYto put together two fuses with different symbols so long as they are of thesame color For example it is okay to put a fuse with a green circle in line with a fuse with a green triangle
But it isNOTokayto put together two fuses withtwo different symbolsthat arealso of two different colors For example putting a fuse with a red circle in line with a fuse with a blue triangle will make an quot explosive quot combination
If this explanation is too confusing don't worry Just follow the diagram below and you will have that bomb diffused in no time at all Please note the symbols that I havesuperimposedon the screenshot You see I realize that the symbols on the fuses are a bit too small to see I also realize that just knowing you are being timed tends to make some people uncomfortable So I have used the superimposition in the hope that it will help make it easier to solve the puzzle But please feel free to let me know if that technique distracts you somehow and I will see what I can do to send you a quot clean quot copy of the solution ndash i e just a screenshot of the solution without the superimposition
The solution to the puzzle is as follows
A cutscene will follow the successful completion of the above puzzle Step out of the close up and go into Minette's studio She is not there Step forward to the pole in the center of the room Note the indentation like that of a windmill at the base of the pole Before we get to that however we need to crack a code with the help of the M decoder we just got from the merchant in the park
The M Message Bring out the Decoder from your inventory
Click on thehandicon that appears on the space bar at the bottom of the screen The keyboard will flip up revealing three dials under it Feel free to refer to Nancy's notebook to find the roman numerals we saw on the three stone disks in the uncropped picture Jean Mi had shown us after we made the parfaits IX V III So set the decoder'sleft dial at IX middle dial at V andright dial at III
Click on the up arrow to come up directly to the typing area Nancy will comment Use our own computer keyboard to type the code under the picture of the M decoder in Noisette's red diary
See picture below
Note Write the whole thing asone single line i e donotleave any blank spaces or press quot Enter quot when you type the above three lines
When you finish typing Nancy will read the decoded message ROUGE BLANC ROUGE BLEU ROUGE If you look up your French English dictionary you will find that the above is French for RED WHITE RED BLUE RED Step out of the close ups on the decoder Note that the indentation at the base of the pole in Minette's studio looks like that of the object you found in the safe at the catacombs So bring out that object from your inventory and place it on the indentation to uncover a panel of five rows of colored bands Click on the bands to set their colors in the order shown above Note the white band on the pole actually looks grayish
A cutscene will follow opening a trap door in the floor on your right Approach the trap door and go down the stairs
The Secret Chamber Go forward in the passage until you come across the metal door Use the key that you got from the chest in the park's underground tunnel to unlock the door Enter the chamber Nancy will comment Step forward Close up on the top of the stand in front of you lift its cover and pick up the envelope Open the envelope and Nancy will translate Noisette's letter for you Note the roman numerals at the end of the letter X IV III
Step out of the close up on the letter and close the stand's cover A cutscene and Nancy's comment will follow Close up on the metal box in front of you Open the cover and close up inside to see the words quot Une Derniere Enigme Cher Ami quot You won't find a translation for the words in your French English dictionary but the literal meaning is quot One last puzzle dear friend quot However it is the French words themselves and not their English meaning that will actually help us figure out the code we need to enter in the metal box
The Lock Puzzle If you look up Noisette's diary you will find that quot Cher Ami quot is the nickname for the M decoder In fact the code applied here is the quot Shift Cipher quot see pages of your Code Book and is the shift number The above French sentence is the message we must decode As the Code Book tells us such a code can require us to shift the letters either to the left or to the right of the alphabet In this case you need toshift to the right as shown below
U N E D E R N I E R E E N I G M E C H E R A M I X V E G M R Q Q E U M E Q Q G P M C K M R D U I We now have everything that we need to break the code So bring out the decoder from your inventory lift the keyboard and set the three dials toX IV III the roman numbers that were noted at the end of Noisette's letter Click on the UP arrow to come up to the typing area Then using your own computer's keyboard again type the third line shown in red at the bottom of the above table If you have done it correctly Nancy will comment as the following line appears on the screen DEUX












UN
CINQ

SE PT Feel free to refer to your French English dictionary to learn that the above words spell out the numbers Step out of the close ups on the decoder Close up on the metal box and click in these numbers The bars will go up Leave the chamber and go to the trap door
The Final Conflict As you step on the gray stairs under the trap door there will be a short cutscene but no need to worry Go up to the trap door and you will hear a dialog outside Nancy will comment Open the trap door and step outside Go around the pole to the red dress on display to the right of the studio door Close up on the dress Bring out the quot Ichido quot book from your inventory and skim through the pages Then click on the red dress Note It might be a good idea toSAVEyour game right after your quot opponent quot stops speaking in case you have to replay the quot battle quot Don't worry though because you will have plenty of time to win
Listen closely to your opponent's Ichido quot cries quot Note that your cursor takes the form of a blue box acting as a shield to block the attack In the following diagram I have listed each quot cry quot according to where you must move your cursor to block the attack that follows that particular cry Thus for example if you hear quot Ssssssss quot move the cursor just a bit off to the middle right of your opponent Note Don't go to the extreme left or right of the screen or you will miss the attack altogether Remember you are supposed to beblockingyour opponent's blows So stay within reach of those blows
As you will soon discover you can be hit several times and still win A cutscene will follow your success So once you have won Just sit back and enjoy the ending

Ice floe Exit the shack and someone in a dark ski suit hits Nancy with a snowball
An explosion follows and a wolf howls
Ice floe puzzle See that the ice broke into floes
Nancy lost her coat and is freezing
The wolf brings a coat to the shoreline
The aim of the puzzle is to stand on an ice floe that will raise the ice floe close to the shoreline where the coat is located
Note that standing in an ice floe will cause another to rise from or disappear into the lake
Step on ice floes all over and watch the shoreline by the coat to see if an ice floe appears
Stand on the ice floe where Nancy is located once or twice before the ice floe by the coat rises
Inferno's Ice Floe solution Thanks Inferno You need to sink at least times first
Solution by Grant and Vicki Thanks
The blocks of ice are laid out in a grid pattern with horizontal vertical and diagonal rows If Nancy moves along a horizontal row eg hopping left to right then random ice floesin that rowwill appear and or disappear If she moves in a vertical direction then it will be ice floesin that columnthat appear and or disappear The same applies for diagonal rows So the key is to jump along rows and columns until the ice floe in the top right corner appears providing a stepping block to the jacket Next you avoid jumpingalongcolumns rows which include the corner floe until you are close enough to step onto it and off the lake
I jumped along the diagonal row linking the top right corner with the bottom left corner When the corner floe appeared I then moved up and right in a step pattern one floe at a time until I reached the corner
Take coat and find anote with a codein the pocket

Vault gates Fox and Geese Game Remember the vault maze map has red gates barring the animal passages
We need to remove that
The clue to this is in the drawings in the journal of the fox and geese
Play the Fox and Geese game with Bill
Use the pig disc to replace the fox disk Mary always had a fox's cunning about her
You have to play and win the game times corner the fox pig on the moose corner pig corner and the raccoon corner
Move the geese around until the fox is cornered in the area you need
The strategy is to herd the fox pig by surrounding him with the geese squares placed one square away from the fox pig
Move the pig area geese down and slowly surround the opponent
Leave a space on the area you want to herd the opponent in usually the corners
The side area geese that is not in play might need to be moved to the fox area to block the opponent going hiding back there
When you get close to the opponent be sure that it can not jump over the goose so that the goose is taken out
Some sacrifices might need to be done to herd it in the corner though
Be sure to have the back and sides of the goose covered
The win makes the eye of the animals glow and the bars in the vault maze will be removed
Isis and the levers Go back to the shack now that we have all animal disks and have lowered the bars

Ice floe Exit the shack and someone in a dark ski suit hits Nancy with a snowball
An explosion follows and a wolf howls
Ice floe puzzle See that the ice broke into floes
Nancy lost her coat and is freezing
The wolf brings a coat to the shoreline
The aim of the puzzle is to stand on an ice floe that will raise the ice floe close to the shoreline where the coat is located
Note that standing in an ice floe will cause another to rise from or disappear into the lake
Step on ice floes all over and watch the shoreline by the coat to see if an ice floe appears
Stand on the ice floe where Nancy is located once or twice before the ice floe by the coat rises
Inferno's Ice Floe solution Thanks Inferno You need to sink at least times first
Solution by Grant and Vicki Thanks
The blocks of ice are laid out in a grid pattern with horizontal vertical and diagonal rows If Nancy moves along a horizontal row eg hopping left to right then random ice floesin that rowwill appear and or disappear If she moves in a vertical direction then it will be ice floesin that columnthat appear and or disappear The same applies for diagonal rows So the key is to jump along rows and columns until the ice floe in the top right corner appears providing a stepping block to the jacket Next you avoid jumpingalongcolumns rows which include the corner floe until you are close enough to step onto it and off the lake
I jumped along the diagonal row linking the top right corner with the bottom left corner When the corner floe appeared I then moved up and right in a step pattern one floe at a time until I reached the corner
Take coat and find anote with a codein the pocket

Vault gates Fox and Geese Game Remember the vault maze map has red gates barring the animal passages
We need to remove that
The clue to this is in the drawings in the journal of the fox and geese
Play the Fox and Geese game with Bill
Use the pig disc to replace the fox disk Mary always had a fox's cunning about her
You have to play and win the game times corner the fox pig on the moose corner pig corner and the raccoon corner
Move the geese around until the fox is cornered in the area you need
The strategy is to herd the fox pig by surrounding him with the geese squares placed one square away from the fox pig
Move the pig area geese down and slowly surround the opponent
Leave a space on the area you want to herd the opponent in usually the corners
The side area geese that is not in play might need to be moved to the fox area to block the opponent going hiding back there
When you get close to the opponent be sure that it can not jump over the goose so that the goose is taken out
Some sacrifices might need to be done to herd it in the corner though
Be sure to have the back and sides of the goose covered
The win makes the eye of the animals glow and the bars in the vault maze will be removed
Isis and the levers Go back to the shack now that we have all animal disks and have lowered the bars

He doesn't feel like answering some question because the band is missing a drummer and he is missing his music
Nancy volunteers to play the drums
Ugh
Drum puzzle Seamus explains how to play the drums
Watch the cue above that moves to the right
When the cue or colored ball hits the drum or circle at the end hit the corresponding color on the drum at the center
Check the timing the ball might react a bit slower or ahead of the hole drum before it can be counted as a score
When a wrong colored ball is hit over the circle at the end the score is subtracted by one point
It is best to skip the ball if not sure that it will get over the drum
A ball counted as correct hit disappears over the drum
I recommend using the keyboard arrows for the outside colors and the space bar for the center gray one
The puzzle is forgiving and will accept a low score if you replay continuously
When the drum puzzle is done take theAncient Celtic Sabbats Ogham book

Deciphered page In the black of night with hurricane winds wailing and giant waves pounding I ordered my fleet to change course and make for land
But with this island in sight the Caridad foundered and disappeared into the sea while the Castidad was set ablaze when lightning ignited her sails and sank amid the smoke and flames
The remaining five ships managed to reach the island where we dropped anchor and waited out the tempest
Deciphered page The light of dawn revealed catastrophic damage
Only a third of my men survived
Worse not one of my ships is salvageable
None shall ever sail again
We are shipwrecked
The only hope we have of ever leaving this accursed place is to be seen by a passing ship
Lest it be a pirate ship I have undertaken to hide our cargo
As a loyal servant of the King it is my duty
Deciphered page Seven ships set sail and so seven pieces shall open the seal
I have tasked each surviving ships rsquo crew with hiding a single item its location known only to them and to me
Securing the treasure itself shall be my task alone
I write this in English so that no one here with me will know how to find it
In this manner any attempt to force the location of the treasure from my men will be fruitless

Picture frame wire puzzle Okay this one is definitely one of the hardest puzzles in this game

Here is a possible result of the finished product Next click on the backing of the fixed portrait

Expo Center Play with the cat commands to your left and then meet Yumi to your right
Shereallyneeds you to make a bento box so let rsquo s
Bento Box This is another challenging puzzle
It rsquo s logic
Unfortunately the puzzles are at random but each box needs to contain two an animal and the ingredient for it
The pictures on the right tell you what each box has but not exactly where on the puzzle
Let rsquo s look at an example
This picture shows a x grid which is obviously the entire size of the bento box
We know for sure the middle on in the x grid is an egg bear so that goes there
We also know a cat egg goes in one corner and a rice bear in the other
What we don rsquo t know is wether the bear and cat in the bottom corner are rice egg or sandwich
Let rsquo s look at the upside down L It has a sandwich rice and a bear
Let rsquo s look at the x grid again
These will overlap
The bear in the L grid is the same as the one in the top right in the x grid just without the rice
So we know the bear is already in place but a sandwich and rice go next to it
Now let rsquo s see the x grid
It has a cat and so does the x grid so that whole slot must go there
The cat sandwich on the x grid goes below the egg cat on the top right
Finish the puzzle and you get this If you rsquo re still having trouble save your game and the puzzle might change
Maybe it rsquo ll be easier for you

Senet The object of the game is to get all your light brown pawns off the board
The light colored casting sticks determine how many squares your selected pawn can move
If dark colored sticks are cast the pawn moves squares
You can throw again if you get or on the casting sticks
Move your pawn to a blank square or a square that has your opponent's pawn but not on your own
If you land on a square with your opponent's pawn you move him back to the square where you came from
This is a good strategy
If a pawn is blocked by or more consecutive opponents pawns it cannot be moved or played until the number of blocker pawns are less than
The square with the ankh dots and eye are safe places the pawn that lands there cannot be bumped back
The square with the bird must be landed on no matter what the casting stick show
The water square bumps the pawn that lands there back to the ankh square above
It is also good strategy to land on safe places so that the opponent settles on squares that it can be bumped back on

Misc I Introduction Important items will be highlighted throughout the walkthrough with asterisks i e
Pick up the polka dotted cow A Controls Just a few notes about the controls to make your life easier
Items can be quickly placed into your backpack inventory by dropping them onto the backpack icon
This is better than scrolling through your inventory to try and find an empty slot
You can open and close your backpack inventory quickly by right clicking anywhere in the screen
Also the PDA can be closed this way but not opened
You still have to click on the PDA icon to open it
Conversation windows can be advanced by right clicking anywhere
Sure beats clicking the small button in the top left corner
On some doors you must first click the handle to partially open the door before you can move through it
Conversely you can close the door the same way
This will be important in one of the puzzles B
General Tips
When searching for small objects the default round cursor will not detect the small object and change to a hand cursor unless the top left corner of the round cursor passes over it
Kind of like the top left point of the standard pointer cursor in Windows
Turning up the brightness on you monitor can help
Most objects don't stand out against the backgrounds
They are of the same brightness and contrast
This may have you squinting and wondering Can I pick this up
Moving your mouse back and forth in a search pattern helps a lot
When the cursor changes to a hand you're in business
Unlike Myst you can actually die in this game
When you touch something that can harm you or you are in a dangerous room a health meter appears on the right side of your screen
If you die you will have to reload from your last save
This brings up my next tip
Save often
You never know when you'll enter a room or trigger something that can be hazardous to your health
Each room has a specific name which I refer to throughout this walkthrough When you save your game it includes the name of the room you are currently in There is also a listing of each room you have visited in the Sketches section of your PDA
Each room includes a bird's eye view screenshot
This list is cleared when you enter a new stage
Check EVERYTHING
From the smallest fragment of wire to a huge statue
You may be surprised at what you are able to pick up II
Revision History v Complete through killing the robot in the Third Stage v Completed Third Fourth and partial Fifth Stages

Lounge When you enter this new stage you may notice that your inventory has been wiped empty
Don't worry
You won't need any of those items anymore Let's take a look at the layout of this huge room
There are levels
The st and nd levels are the Lounge
The rd level is the Cartography Room You are currently on the nd level
This level has a set of chains hanging on the left and right side of the room

Misc If you find any corrections that need to be made in this FAQ please email me at tremoir rocketmail com
I will gladly credit you in the FAQ FAQ's written by me Myst III Exile Mystery Of The Nautilus The This document Copyright Allia If you're gonna share this on any other sites just give credit where credit is due by leaving this statement in Look for these and future FAQ's of mine at Neoseeker com http neoseeker com GameFAQs http www gamefaqs com Gameguru http gameguru box sk DLH Net http DLH Net Cheat Code Central http www cheatcc com Just Adventure http www justadventure com GameBoomers http www gameboomers com
I suspect that many players who normally resist peeking at a walkthrough will find themselves yielding in the case of Mystery of the Nautilus
For that reason I will create a two fold walkthrough
The main body will be the traditional step wise complete walkthrough and the extra section will contain only a list of rooms and objects and how to find them
This is because of the frequent difficulty of locating an object due to the tiny hot spot associated with it Stumped by only the Organ Puzzle
Click Here
After the introduction which shows you a professor taking a mini sub and entering the Nautilus in direct opposition to your Captain's orders
You are in a decompression room and can go no further until you equalize the pressure
Do that by pulling the chain in the corner by the door
You hear the door unlock
Notice the Nautilus Emblem on the hatch where you entered
It's a capital N with an anchor superimposed
You will see this symbol several times
Before you go through the door wipe the condensation from the glass window three times and see an apparition of some kind
Enter the next room where the diving equipment is kept A brief word aboutSaving your Game Don't hesitate to save often there are twenty four slots
You can scroll down the three saved game pages eight at a time
In order to access the PDA and create a saved game your inventory must be closed
Right click to close the inventory
Here's a trick to help you save the view you want when you go to the PDA the view rotates
If you move the cursor swiftly to the closed inventory bag first then over to the PDA you get minimal motion of the view
Your primary goal in Stage One is to gain access to rest of the submarine
At present you are limited to the airlock and diving equipment room a corridor and the Kitchen Dining Room and Library
Just in front of you on the floor is a page torn from a book
As you read it you realize that this vessel was deliberately abandoned
To exit the close up of the book flip the lower right corner Other items in this room include a pair ofleather gloves arusted screwdriver and awooden box
Find the gloves in the drawer of the chest behind you the screwdriver on the shelf just above that and the wood on the bottom shelf next to the opposite door
Step forward to get there
Don't worry about getting shocked but you cannot open the door as long as it is electrified
Interestingly the gloves are called Rubber Gloves when you find them then called Leather Gloves when they are in your inventory
You need to wear the gloves
To do that open your inventory and place the gloves atop the bottom icon that represents yourself
It's a bit weird looking but any object you have picked up can be placed over your face indicating you are wearing it
Only gloves boots and clothing items are appropriate to use this way
Use theBallin the sparking circuit box to short out the sparks and make the door safe to pass
If you try to use the ball without wearing the gloves welcome to your first Timed Sequence
There are several timed sequences in this game but they are all more than fair
There seems to be plenty of time the timer just adds to the tension
Spin the wheel to unlock the door and go into the Corridor
Directly opposite is the door to the Dining Room
Looking left you can see two doors the one at the end is heavy and locked by four diagonal bars
To its right is the Kitchen door
Looking instead to the right are two more doors
The one at the end is locked by a nine digit keypad
Pleasedon'texperiment with it
The door to its left is the Library
Click on the handle to open the door and go into the Library
Meet Captain Nemo his diary that is
Right click to continue
Before you roam around the room rotate right and find the large book leaning on the lower right shelf
You get only its title quot Complex Mechanics and Imitating the Human Mind quot Turn around to the left and click on the bookstand to read a letter from Auguste Champenois
Step forward and examine the fan
Seems we might be able to unscrew the grate
Still got that screwdriver
Use it on the corners
Oops it really was rusty
Now we need something stronger
Turn left and go to the shelf
Open the book and examine it
Hmmm a secret hiding place
What could he have used it for
Rotate left and find theMatchesin the base of the hanging lamp
Let's leave here and go to the Kitchen
In front of you is a kitchen range and aPressure Cookeryou can pick up
Turn left and go to the other end of the kitchen
Find several hot spots the sink the water tap the stovetop the firebox and the cupboard above
Down below left of the stove is another good look at that Nautilus Logo
The cupboard is locked
You do not have a key
How about a more violent method
Put the pressure cooker in the sink and fill it with water
Place it on the stove
Put the pieces of wood 'wooden box' from your inventory in the firebox
Matches won't work
You need something for kindling
Turn right and go to the large sideboard
Open the right hand drawer and take theNotes Go back to the stove and use the paper you just found in the firebox then the matches
The fire starts and the pressure cooker makes steam
Before you proceed be sure the door between the Kitchen and Library is closed just in case you were exploring Click on the steam to cause the pressure cooker to overheat
It explodes and breaks the cupboard door
You can take theOyster Knife Another timed sequence begins in which you must exit the kitchen and close both doors
If both kitchen doors happen to be open at this time just be sure to close one of them from inside the kitchen then exit the other one and close it from the outside
You can go either way just so long as you close one door from the inside first
You may run out of time if you try to close them from the library and corridor sides
It's possible to do but the little thought box keeps popping up at the top and uses precious time
Whichever way you went out of the kitchen go now into the Dining Room
On the table the far end from the kitchen take theCandle Holder Optional On the outside wall open the red curtains by clicking on them and open the shutter by moving the two levers under it
Watch your friends searching for you
You can close the shutter or leave it open your choice
That Oyster Knife looks stronger than an old rusty screwdriver for sure
Go down the corridor and into the Library
We seem to have done just about everything possible and there are no more unlocked doors
What to do
Use the Oyster Knife to finish the job on that grate then stop the blades with the candlestick
Thud
Go through the hole into what's called the Lounge Your primary goal in this segment is to restore electrical and mechanical power and gain access to more of the rooms
As you enter you get sort of a virtual tour
Gives you an idea of the layout
Looking around you see that you are standing on a sort of U shaped balcony
Let's call the 'base' of the U where you entered the South side of the room
On the east and west arms of the balcony are matching arrays of chains and orbs
If you go to one of these devices and try to operate it you learn that the power must be restored first
This tells us what the purpose of this segment is
Looking over the railing to the level below you see a circular grouping of sofas a round table and a cabinet
Looking up you discover an elevated platform
Turn right from the grate entrance and go forward once
Looking down you can see and examine a fuse box
Part of our job will be to find the fuses
Looking up from the fuse box there is a door that invites you to enter DO NOT go through this door Thecorridors are electrifiedand you will be searching for a saved game instead of some fuses Then touch theControl Boxon the column to lower the circular stairs
You can climb up to the Cartography Room
Upstairs step forward toward the right and observe the Periscope controls
You can open it but without power for lighting it is useless for now
You can leave it open or closed your choice
You must at least open it or you cannot proceed to the next node
Turn left and go to the Projector
You can open it but nothing happens
Apparently it needs a part or power or both
Turn around left toward the maps and take the metalRodthat is hanging by a chain from the superstructure
That's all for now in the Cartography Room
Go down and head to the North end of the room where the ship's steering mechanism is
You will get another visit from Nemo's video diary extolling the autopilot system
Before you do anything else go over to the other side West of the balcony area and walk to the chain and orbs device
Look on the floor behind the chains to find anotherBolt This one is easier to see
Now go back to the spot where Nemo talked to you and examine the large metal hatch in the floor
You need something like a crowbar to open it
Use the Rod you found upstairs
The hatch opens
Go down three times straight down to reach the bottom level
Standing within the ladder you can pick up theBeltfrom the floor
It looks like you should be able to step forward where the Belt was but can't
Look to the right and climb through the bars
From that location you can see a lever on your left doesn't work yet and two gears on the floor
Pick up aGear Look to the right and climb the metal steps and enter the Engine Room Step forward twice into the Engine Room
See another episode from the Captain's Diary
Look down and to the right open the chest and take theFuses Step forward once more and look down and to the left to observe theBattery It needs help from some object you do not yet have
Forward yet again look down to the right and pick up the redClaw Another step forward takes you through a door into the Dormitory
It's very dark in here
Turn around to your left and find theLight Switchon the right side of the door
Uh Oh
Now you've done it
That dratted computer knows you don't belong there and has electrified the corridors making it lethal to wander around
Step forward twice and examine the bottom bunk on your left
You can lift the mattress and find theBottle Step forward again to the end of the room and look at the lockers on the right
The end one opens and you find apair of boots Take them then 'wear' them by placing the boots over your icon
Back to the other end of the room and pull the lever next to the spiral staircase to open the shutter at the top
Step back into the room and climb the stairs to theElectrified Corridorabove
Exit the door and find yourself in the Lounge
Go down the West side and around toward the couches find the large cabinet
Open it place the bottle on the shelf then open the other side
From the bucket on the bottom shelf take theIcepick When you solve the lock you get word that the rudder is broken
Go examine the devices to the left of the wheel
It tells you that the left hand gauge is Azimuth that means which direction you go and the right hand gauge is Pitch up or down
The button on top will enter the settings you choose but how to know
That remains to be solved
Let's go get some of this equipment working Return to the electrified corridor the door right next to the fuses
Close the stairway by pulling the lever and go forward to find theCablesticking out of a grate
Use the Icepick to pry open the grate and take the cable
Go through the other door and find yourself in theMuseum After your visit from Nemo go to the left of the big table and turning right find the projector
Take theProjector Bulb
You can poke around and even play with the organ but nothing really happens until later
Go back into the corridor open the stairs and down into the Dormitory
Go into the Engine room and use the Cable on the Battery
Go into the gears room and climb up to the top level of the ladder
Use the Belt to connect the wheels in the first catwalk go into the other catwalk and use the gear
Climb down one level and fasten the two gears using the Bolts
Each time you connect something correctly the wheels spin momentarily
Go down to the ground level and pull the Lever to start the machines
Shortcut Now that the machines work you can go up the ladder and directly into the Lounge
Go upstairs to the Cartography area and open theProjectorand put the bulb inside
Close the Projector and turn left to see the map illuminated with an image of our ship and Uh Oh heading directly for a canyon wall
Before you go look on the floor behind a chest to the left of the Projector
Near the N logo in the railing and find a paper showing the following Look familiar
These are theChains and Orbs which will now work that we have restored the power
When you set them correctly the Exterior Shutters will open and you will be able to see out the windows and use the Periscope
Go set the chains
The view is from South to North or from Aft to Forward
That is the Orb nearest the Fusebox should be down the middle one should be up and the one nearest the steering mechanism should be centered Once you open them things start to get interesting
Go back to the map room and look into thePeriscope You will see your friends doing some 'research' that is dropping depth charges to see the effect on the terrain
The effect is you will be crushed if you don't move out Open your PDA and find the Calculator It displays two things the current settings for Azimuth and Pitch and the calculatedNew Settingswhich will keep you from colliding with the canyon walls
Go back to the steering gauges and put the new settings in
on the left and on the right
Then press the button on top
The Sub moves safely to its next position
You must go back upstairs to get the new readings
You don't have to look into the periscope or at the maps just be there
Open the Calculator and find the next two numbers Azimuth and Pitch
Go back to the controls and input the correct numbers
The third set is left up to the Intrepid Adventurer that's You
If you can't do it without me telling you how then you know who you are and why I won't reveal the answer
The organ starts with three notes
Each time you repeat a sequence correctly it adds one note
The total sequence is shown above
Complete the puzzle correctly and the door to Nemo's Bedroom opens
Go there
Your goal here is to survive an encounter with destroy a lethal robot and regain access to rooms that were locked by the security system
Nemo's Bedroom is a strange room
First you annoy the security system
Then a visit from Nemo then the Oxygen is reduced and a timer starts
Do not panic there is LOTS of time
Just go about your business
First turn around to face the door you just came in
There are two hotspots The top one needs some kind of item to help it
The lower one can be picked up
It is aHolographic Lens Try to exit the other door
It is locked
Touch the glass and it breaks
Replace the broken window with the Holographic Lens
It fits
There is a scale that shows you weighing kilos
Weird that's exactly what I weigh
How did it know
While you are there look toward the sink and twist the mirror
Step toward the Star Map
The map wants some object
The floor creaks and the locked door opens
Great
The floor seems to be a pressure switch connected to the door
Oops
Step off the plate in the floor and the door locks again
Rats
Maybe we can find some way to hold the plate down
Pick up theShelland theGlobeand place both objects on the floor switch
Now the door stays unlocked
Go over beside the bed and find thePendantunder the pillow
Go back to the other side of the room where theStar Mapis
Use the Pendant on the map to reveal the constellationCassiopeia The stars are labeled in Greek
Copy down the seven letters b a h g d e i
Now you can go back to the puzzle insert the Pendant and solve the lock
Inside the safe take theKey If you have not disturbed the tumblers you can solve it thus from left to right give the tumblers this many clicks
If you have experimented with the lock that solution has no meaning for the puzzle does not reset to its original state Caution The key you just found will unlock the other door in the bedroom DO NOTgo in there yet
Go through the doorway that you unlocked with the pressure switch and find yourself in a corridor
Look over your right shoulder at the artwork to reveal some kind of clue It would appear that we are expected to reflect light from some source and use it to destroy an enemy
Let's see what happens
After all we have already installed a lens and turned a mirror
Must be on the right track
Go into the room directly across the hall the Guest Room
Looking left there is aStatuethat can be picked up
Oh well you know the routine quot it's not nailed down quot Go to the desk
Take theRopethat is on the floor
Go to the sink
Take theMirrorand thePolish Look at the grate in the opposite wall There issomethingin there but you can't reach it
Exit the Guest Room and look down at the floor
Leave the statue there
Go to the end of the corridor and place the Mirror on the grate next to the door
Enter the room the Mess Hall
Just left of the door is a garment you can take It is a reinforcedCoat Put the coat on and leave it on
It's for your own good
Go to the end of the table and step toward the dart board
Down and to the left is anotherHolographic Lensand aHandful of Darts Further left is aMechanical Arm To the right on the table is a MetalPlate It needs to be shined up
You did find some polish but it's not quite that simple
Step back from the dartboard and throw some darts
Caution I have had the game lock up on me at this point you might just want to save before throwing the darts
You can only throw three
Goretrieve your darts
Exit this room and go back to Nemo's Bedchamber
Open the other locked door with the Key
Be sure you are wearing the Reinforced Coat
Go into the Laboratory
Here it seems is the source of light we need
Now how to make it useful
If you were adventuresome and have already explored the lower level near the Mess Hall you'll know what you're up against
Step forward into the lab and find the drawer on the right side open it and take theDuster rag
Go to the end of the room and turn off theLaser Projector
Hear the warnings from Nemo
The end wall where the Periodic Table is is a hotspot
Use the Rope there and it attaches to the Projector Switch and extends through a vent in the wall
Go back to the center of the lab and take theAcidfrom the side you couldn't reach while the laser was working
Use the acid on the glass window in the door and replace the glass with the Holographic lens
Return to the corridor where you left the statue
Place the Plate in the statue's hands
Put some polish on the plate and wipe it clean with the Duster
Aha
Now I see a plan coming together
At the other end of the corridor you will find the rope protruding through the grate high up On the lower level one door is locked the other contains a surprise
Open it and find yourself facing a killer robot
Right click to close the dialog windows and as soon as possible turn around and exit the room
Go to the stairs and press the red button to go up
Now you are up and the Robot is down
Safe for a moment
Send the chair down then bring it and the robot up
Pull that rope to turn on the Laser and enjoy the Robot Roast
Now it seems Ms Security Freak has no sense of humor at all
She proceeds to lock all the doors
The only place accessible is the room where the robot was the Technical Room
Go into the room and approach the desk
Four items here Pick up theMatchesandWirefrom the desktop and thePliersfrom the wall to the left of the desk
Also examine theWiring Diagramon the wall
Now go to the opposite corner of the room and look at the shelves
Two objects here top shelf at the far left is anIron Bar and middle shelf in the center aCold Chisel Now go through that shimmering door it's just a holographic illusion
Look left and find theDynamiteon the very top shelf On the floor near where you found the Bar and the Chisel is aBattery Fill it with acid from your inventory use the Iron Bar and the Wire to create anElectromagnet Take it with you
Go open the large circuit Box next to the desk
If you try to touch the wires they are too hot and if you try to touch the pipes on the right hand compartment it is too cold
Maybe you could combine the cold with the heat
Use the Cold Chisel to cut through the divider
Now you can handle the wires
Let's have a look at that wiring diagram
This would be the device that controls the locks on various doors
You see six door controls and below that Positive Ground and Negative poles
The Positive side is circled indicating that this is the pole that activates the lock
Therefore the wires leading to that left hand Pole should be cut
Use your pliers and cut the following wires Top row Left Center Right
Bottom row none you got into that room because that wire is already broken Left Left
If you cut an incorrect wire you will get a shock
If you cut more than one wrong wire the Life Meter will appear
It's not a timer it just gets lower each time you snip the wrong wire
Too many and it's Game Over
The meter goes away when you have opened all the doors and exit the Technical Room
Go across the hall and use that Dynamite on the door
Don't forget to look down it goes on the floor
Use the matches to explode the Dynamite and gain access to the Pump Room
Good thing you've got that full metal jacket on
To the right is a machine with two levers
Use the Mechanical arm on the left lever
It still needs help
Throw a dart at the other end of the room
You have destroyed a machine of some sort
Still more help is needed
Time to search
Go upstairs and into the Guest Room
Let's see if that Electromagnet will attract whatever is in there
Aha
It's a key
Back to the Pump Room
Use the key to wind up the Arm then touch the Arm to turn it on
Pull the right hand lever three times to start all the oxygen pumps
You will notice your O meter rises to normal then retracts
Let's go to the Museum Your job is to deal with damage after an attack by a Giant Squid and force the monster to leave
When you enter the Museum the ship is attacked by an enormous Squid
The creature is still hanging on and has penetrated the hull at one or more points
The museum is a shambles
Opposite the door you can see a harpoon in its display case but it is too firmly attached for you to pick it up
Go left toward the red sofa and find theIce Axeon the floor
You have to move a broken display case to get to the axe
Then go to the Organ and find theDiving Suitand theOrgan Pipeon the floor
Go back to theHarpoonand release it using the Ice Axe
Go into the corridor and assess the damage
The door to the Lounge is jammed but the stairway mechanism still works
The room below is flooded with sea water
You need to go down there to retrieve some items
You can wear the diving suit if you like but it contains no air
With or without the suit on you have less than a minute to accomplish your goal
If you do not think you are going to get everything done on one breath come back upstairs to breath and get almost a minute again
Going down that squid's tentacle is in the way
Stick it with the Harpoon
Go to the lockers at the end of the room and find the open locker on the right
Take theair tank Iron Bar and Digicodedevice
If you have enough time turn around from the lockers and push the red button
The shutter closes and the squid is forced to retreat
Go back upstairs as soon as you have the items
Return as often as you need to to get the three items and get rid of the squid
It's best to do all this on natural air rather than using the tank
It only contains about eight minutes and there's plenty to do
After you have pushed the red button the door to the Engine Room is accessible
Enter turn right and pick up aChainfrom the deck
Turn around the other way and find a solitary piece ofRubber Tubing two Hooks and several more pieces of tubing Step into the room twice look left and repair the leak with the solitary piece
Step forward twice more and repair the leaking pipe on the floor and the overhead leaking pipes on the right and left
Finally go to the far door and repair the leaks overhead with tubing and the organ pipe
Now you can go into the Gears Room
Need a rest
Climb up the ladder above the water line and you can take off the mask saving precious air
Besides that you have something to do up there
Step forward twice and find theKeysitting on the I beam
Notice also the action cursor calling for an inventory item
What would fit nicely on the beam
TheChain of course
Go all the way down two clicks down and find the bottom end of the chain
Put a Hook on it
Back to the ladder and go up once
Exit the ladder find the chain and beam and attach them together with a hook
Then use your Iron Bar to dislodge the beam
The weight of the beam brings up the gear
Click on the gear it automatically installs into position
Go up the ladder and discover at the top you can exit the hatch into the lounge
Whew
To the right East of the Steering console is a cluster of equipment
Higher up on a pole is a lever that doesn't seem to do anything
Shucks
Let's go to work
Back to the center lounge area and look for a Sofa that you can move
Take it and it is stacked on the other sofa to soften the blow if you slip
Climb up the ironwork to the Cartography area
Go forward left and pick up theCablefrom the floor
Go to thePeriscopeand use the Cable and the Key
The periscope rises
poking the squid who finally departs
Now go back and pull that lever near the steering area and the water is pumped from the lower levels
Go up to the south side of the Balcony area to the door next to the hole you crawled through from the library
This door remember was at the end of the original corridor and has a digital keypad
Take out your Digicode device from the PDA andReinitializeit
Now take it out from your inventory and use it on the keypad
Go through the door and enter the Library the door on the right Time to escape
You are in the Library
Go forward once and find the diagram showing theEscape Bell It gives you some idea how to get out
Go left look down and take the little greenRingthat is sitting on a book lying on the floor
That's all in the Library
Exit go right and enter the first door on the left the diving equipment room
As you enter you learn that the vessel has come in contact with volcanic material and the emergency escape hatch is blocked by a rock
Down and to the left are some boots
Take theRope
To the right up on the wall take the greenPipefrom the spool
Looks like a fire hose
At your feet are two levers
Pull the left one and you see the upper half of the locks retracted from the door to the Escape Bell
Pull the other lever an get a dire message denying you access and reminding you the way out is blocked
The air pressure is decreasing
Go toward the door to the airlock and find thePlierssitting in a drawer on the floor
Thank goodness Nemo had no shortage of pliers
Exit the room and go straight across into the Dining Room
Go around the table to the right to see Nemo for the last time
Go to the circular window and take theCurtain Rod Pole that has fallen to the floor
To the left use the Ring to break into the cabinet
Take theAlcoholand thePiece of Cloth From here go left and into the Kitchen all the way to the other end look left and up high
Take theBoxfrom the top shelf
You may have looked at these objects during your earlier visit to the kitchen but the box was not available at that time
Notice the leaking steam pipe
Something is needed here
Go into the corridor to the point between the Library and Diving Room
Look at the carpet
Roll the carpet back to reveal a hatch
It's hard to move
Do you happen to have any tools
Use the Pliers
Don't just jump in use your Rope to get down safely
And to get back out in case you don't have everything you need to survive here
Oh no
More lasers
If you try to walk through the lasers the Life Meter not a timer pops up
Turn off the lasers by using your pole on the upper and lower switches on the right door jamb
Go to the shelves where you previously found the chisel and locate theAdapter Turning around go toward the back room and find theDynamitein a drawer down low and on the right
Climb up to the corridor and go into the Kitchen
Use that Adapter on the leaking steam pipe and attach the green pipe to it
Step around so you are facing that wall and use the Pliers to open the hatch near the floor
Put the Pipe in the Hatch
Excellent
You have hosed that dratted security nuisance
Perhaps now that other lever in the Diving room will function Pull the right hand lever and observe the door to the escape bell being unlocked
Take a minute and explore the escape bell and the catwalk that leads around it on the right
You find the slide where it should exit the submarine but the way is blocked by an airlock
Perhaps some dynamite will help
Unfortunately the fuses are way too short and the dynamite must be prepared first
Alright McGyver put your skills to work
Go to the Kitchen
Standing in the same spot where you toasted the security pest turn on the Stove
Put the Box on the back burner
Put the dynamite rag and alcohol in the box
The flame ignites the fuse and the timer starts
Don't forget to drag it into your inventory so you can move
Having explored you know where to go
Throw the bomb down the escape chute opening the airlock
Close the hatch by pulling the lever that is between all the gauges to the right of the hatchway
Look right and find the two levers
Pull the left one first then the right
Right click to close the dialogue box and away you go
Well it seems Captain Nemo has the last word after all

Walkthrough byTally Ho The opening movie brings you to your home in Providence Rhode Island in
You are William Stanton ordinary man about to step into an adventure
Your assignment Mr Stanton should you decide to accept it is to save the world
As you sit in the drawing room there is a knock on the door
Answer the front door and a very distraught Edgar Wycherley gives you a stone pyramid and tells you not to give it to anyone most of all himself
Go back into the drawing room and find the key on the phone stand
Go to the desk in the corner of the room and use the key to open the middle drawer
Take the money go ahead it's your money and the keys to the motorcycle
As you leave
there is another knock at the door
Meet Doctor Egleton who gives you his telephone number and some information You can wander at will in Pawtuxet knocking on doors and attempting to converse with people
Generally however due to the very linear nature of Necronomicon there is only one suitable action at any time
If you prefer to do your own wandering throughout the game and discover the correct action without my spoiling it there is a list of locations to visit in the correct sequence onThis Page
Go start the motorcycle and go to the right into Pawtuxet
They spell it Pawtucket these days
Kind of a quiet town not much is going on
You can try to talk to people and knock on doors but the only response you will get is from the old lady in an alley behind the church
She is Ma Brady and she suggests you see Mr Crumb at the General Store
We hope it's open because there was a closed sign when we looked before
The big challenge is finding Ma Brady Anyway to find her stand in front of the General Store the light grey building with the closed sign and turn right toward the church
Walk forward four times and look right to see the alley with the reddish barrel
Go into the alley as far as you can and talk with Ma Brady
Give her some money and she will tell you to see Mr Crumb at the grocer's
Talking with Mr Crumb he tells you need a map
Pick up a map then add some money to it to make the purchase
Twenty bucks for a map
Twenty more for the information
Things were hot in the 'twenties I guess
While you are there buy a box of matches
You won't be needing them for quite a while but you'll be glad to have them when the time comes Now that you have a map you can just open it and click on your destination to travel instantly You can walk to Edgar Wycherleys house from here just go past Ma Brady's alley and keep going or click on the northernmost house on the map Don't ring that bell too often The housekeeper won't let you in and he gets increasingly unfriendly
Just Leave
Edgar's parents' house is the furthest west on the map
Go there and speak with Edgar's father
It's a strange one way sequence where you have no chance to partake in the conversation except to make it continue byclicking on the portraitof Gregor Herschell over the fireplace
After that return toPawtuxet Go see Mr Crumb at the General store and pay him for information about Herschell
He suggests you talk to the captain who is down by the water working on his boat
The captain recalls Herschell and mentions the Gazette which appears on your map
Go to the Providence Gazette office and speak to the editor who gives you several important dates
Go into the archive room and search for some files
The notable years you must access areMissing Soldiers andThe Fire
The missing soldiers story and the fire story will be placed in the Bureau in your inventory
You can open all the file drawers but not all contain pop up files and not all pop up files are readable and there are others which you can read but are non essential
Use the stool to reach the top files and stoop down to get to the bottom ones
You cannot exit the newspaper office through the doorway you must use your map to go next to Pawtuxet village and speak with the boat captain again
He refers you to Blackfish who lives in the house right behind where you are standing with the two barrels in front
Blackfish seems thirsty and not particularly friendly
Go to the Grocery and buy him abottle of Hooch You might want to save your game before giving Mr Blackfish the hooch
It loosens his tongue as it is apt to loosen mine and thine and he sails into a lengthy monologue which you cannot repeat
If you need to hear it again a saved game is the only way repeat this speech
He tells you to go see Mr Procop whose name you might have seen in a article about some vandalism
Mr Procop says he needs time for research to come back tomorrow
Let's go back to Edgar's house at the top of the map
This time he is home and you can enter
Edgar seems a bit out of sorts
He introduces you to Dr Owens
When the conversation stops you can poke around the house if you want to but everything is inactive for now
Go back home to your own house
The telephone has the puzzle gears on it so use the phone number Dr Egleton gave you
It triggers another conversation you cannot repeat
Either save before starting it or be good at taking notes
The suggestion is made that Edgar must be committed to an asylum
Use your map to go to Edgar's parents' home
Talk to father and go upstairs
Open the desk drawer second from the right
There is akeythere which you may not be able to see but the hand cursor will indicate something can be picked up
You can poke around the room but it's just busy work
There is nothing in the bed stand the chest nor the bureau
Go to Edgar's house
This time no one is home and you must use the key to get in
You are able to explore the corner cupboards and the sideboard
In the sideboard you will find theletter from Simonand the'indecipherable' letter
Go to your own home and speak with Dr Egleton
You see the scene where Edgar is taken and committed
By the way doesn't that portrait next to the door look a lot like Johannes Brahms
At the end you have arrived at Edgar's home again
Look in the left hand corner cupboard bottom drawer
Take two items a key and a map of the bungalow
Go back home give the map to Dr Egleton and go to the bungalow
Walk around back of the building to find a small open shed
Take thecar keysfrom the hook and go to the car
Open the trunk finding apry bar
This is your key to the front door
Go inside and see the close up view of thezodiac tapestry
Cross the room and find acalendarfrom on the table
Don't ask me to explain the astrological references
go further to the sideboard and pull it away from the wall revealing a niche with alockbox
Use the heart hey to open the box and take the two objects a largeornate keyand amedalliondepicting Saturn with a scythe and his symbol
Make a mental connection with his image and the man in the tapestry with a scythe and the alchemist's symbol for lead
Head toward the stairs then left into the pantry
Move the barrel open the trapdoor to find a lock puzzle
Three rings can be rotated to select metallic symbols planetary symbols and names archangels maybe
I'm a little hazy on that sort of history
The clue to the name is to be found in Herschell's Journal
If you select Lead clicks Saturn clicks and Cassiel clicks the big lock is revealed
Use the big lock to open the door to the underground passageway
If for some reason you did not buymatchesat the grocer's you will need to do that now
Enter the tunnels and light the torches along the way
I had to play this segment after dark with the lights off and fiddle with the monitor's settings in order to see anything
Some players have suggested turning the monitor's brightness up to maximum
You will have exactly enough matches eight to make it into the room where the candelabra is
Some of the torches are difficult to find because you must look behind yourself after you step forward
Search up and down along the walls
You must not skip any torches
Do not go more than two steps forward without finding a torch
The ninth match will be used on the candelabra
When you are down to one match you arrive at a closed gate but the door to the right is open
Go in and use your last match to light the candelabra
Step toward the globe and pull the lever changing the gates in the passageway
Your exit back to the bungalow is now blocked and the other passage is open
Pick up the lighter from the table
Go out to the hallway find the lantern on the wall and light it Save Your Game Here Please You will be entering the Well Room
If you step in a hole it's Game Over
Eeeek
Now that wasn't very friendly
You look in a hole just to see what's there and the monster startles you and you lose the lantern down the hole
Rats
Oh well we've been through worse than this and saved the world too
Up and at 'em
From the entrance don't step forward into the room turn right instead hugging the wall and go along the wall two steps
Light the torch on the wall
It's over your shoulder and up high
Turn toward the center of the room and stepping between the wells go to the altar and pick up theaxefrom the floor
Do it quickly because the torch will go out leaving you with no light to find your way back to the wall
Going TO the altar is not hard just find the steps between the wells
Coming back the route is harder to see
Here's some help Okay here
A picture is worth a thousand hints right
Assuming you did light the torch and can see after you get to the altar and pick up the hatchet rotate to the LEFT until you see the arrow pointing to the right hand door and step once toward it
Like this Then turn left some more until you are pointing directly toward a hole that is two steps away and left of the doors and step once toward it Then turn right until you are pointing at the middle of the three doors After that go right toward the torch even if it has gone out hug the wall and exit where you came in
After that go right toward the torch even if it has gone out hug the wall and exit where you came in
Go back to the chandelier room
You can now open the chest with the hatchet and find anotherkey and lantern
Light it and unlock the big cabinet with the new key
Take thefuel canandalchemist's briefcase
To the left look for a stairway
Go up and take the Spirits of the Day book
It gives you essential formulas and clues
Back downstairs Take the Book of Oaths from the table
Exit the office left once then right into the archway
The left fork takes you into a nothing room the right fork takes you to a coffin
lift the lid raise the hand of the corpse to find anotherkey
Go back to the well room and hugging the wall go all the way round to the Lab
You still have the lantern so now you can see
Open the gate with the key and enter the lab to discover it is dark
We will have to generate power to get the lights going
Go all the way to the back of the room
Uh oh
There's another one of those zodiac locks
Later for that
Look right and enter the boiler room
There's a coal scoop in the coal bin on the floor next to the door
Use the coal scoop to load the furnace three times pour on some starter fluid and light the fire
Close the grate
Look up
Pull the center of three levers open the valve and the steam starts flowing
Go back through the lab all the way to the entrance and from facing the door step to the left once
Turn to your left and look down
Find the valve that gives steam to the generator and turn it
Then go back to the the door
Just to the left of the door on the wall is the master switch
Turn on the power so we can see something
Heaven knows we've started enough boilers and generators in our gaming days
The hardest part about this one is finding that generator valve on the floor
It's very dark
Watch for the spyglass cursor
Go to the other end of the room to the left of the puzzle lock and find the controls attached to a brain in a jar
Start the mechanism with the button on the left and turn the lever on the right to get the brain talking
He winds down needing vital fluid to keep him going
Across the room is a lab table with a bunch of jars on shelves behind
Go behind the table to find the chemical apparatus
You need to mix two ingredients in the beaker to create the vital fluid
If you experiment with random combinations from the shelves behind you all sorts of reactions are possible
Both chemicals come from the bottom shelf
Use the third jar from the right and the second from the left counting the one without the pickup cursor
You can tell by the reaction that you mixed the correct ingredients
To use the fluid you need the syringe which is sitting in the sink across the aisle
It doesn't look terribly sterile but I don't think Brain will care
A fix is a fix and we need the information he possesses at any cost
We have the world to save after all
Go to the vacuum jar next to Brain and inject the vital fluid
Pull the lever beneath the jar to activate it
Get Brain talking by turning on the power with the button on the left and flipping the switch at the right until he talks to you
Now you get scads of information from Brain including the opportunity to make choices and answer questions and learn the connection between weekdays and planets Mars and Tuesday for example
If you studied the Spirits of the Day book throughly you have some idea of the recipe needed to raise Mr Levy a Mars Spirit from the dead
Go to the herb cabinet near the entrance to the lab
On the desk nearby is a botany book
Look in it to see what Euphorbia looks like
Click on the lower right quadrant of the cabinet to see the drawer labeled Charcoal
Open it take the charcoal and take the key
Then two rows above that is a label that is unreadable
Look in the drawer to see some Euphorbia
Take some
There is only one slot in your inventory that holds herbs and if you take the wrong herb it will be in your inventory just to mislead you
You could spend months trying to figure out this recipe to raise the dead
You would probably need to use it on yourself by the time you figured it out Now for the lock
The clues for the lock in the bungalow were fairly evident
This one was not so obvious
Check the Spirits of the Day book and Herschell's Journal
The planet sign is Mars Tuesday and the metal is iron
The name Samuel bears the same symbol as found in the journal
Looking at the engraving on the lock it compares most closely with this page in the Book of oaths
Remember the name Eliphas Levis
Go into the Chamber of Amphorae
Thefar left aisleis labeled Materials
Go up that aisle five steps and look close up to the left
The amphora you want is labeled E L Take the ashes with you and proceed out of this room into the torture chamber
Put the charcoal and styrax find it in the alchemist's briefcase on the incense burner and ignite them with your lighter
Open the table drawer and find Eliphas Levy's card and place it on the pentagram on the floor
Put his ashes there along with a diamond and some Euphorbia
Burn them
If you goof up somehow and use the wrong herb or jewel or ashes you can return to the lab to get Euphorbia and to the urn room to get the right ashes
The name card reappears in the drawer and the incense is still burning You might want to save your game before starting the fire
A very long cutscene follows and if you want to hear it again a saved game is the only way replay it
Take Edgar's key
You finish up in your home where there is nothing to do
Go back to Edgar's house the one at the top of the map and go down to the basement
Use the key to open that door and take three items from the room astatuetteand apackagefrom the shelf and theNecronomiconfrom the cabinet
Go back upstairs turn right into the living room and pick up thelabelfrom the top of the bookcase
On the way out the door pick up thenewspaperand theletter from the floor and return home
Give the Necronomicon to Dr Egleton
Idowish he would glue his teeth in a little tighter
The library appears on your map so let's visit there
Go all the way to the back of the room to the right to enter the office
After meeting the librarian show him the Necronomicon thenexamine the bookhe is reading
Find it a little hard to read Click Here for a transcript Exit the office and go almost back to the entrance to find the Occult Sciences section
F L F L F You can examine many books but the one you are looking for is in the small shelf just under the window
The Moon Gateway to the Soul
Take it to the Librarian Examine the bookto find a clue about the dragon Click here for a transcript Exit the office and go straight across to the entrance to the rare book archives downstairs
Find the Red Dragon book and take it to the Librarian Examine that bookfor more clues Click here for a transcript This is pretty good stuff
Actually it clarifies the whole point of the game
Next find the Symbolism section the bay adjacent to the Occult
From the office F L F L F R F L F Find the Language of Initiates book under the window and take it to the office
The Librarian discovers references to the Ancient Cities
He produces a map and it is up to you to find their locations
Place objects on the map in the following positions sequence is unimportant
The Gazette GreenlandThe Label AfricaThe Package Surinam South America The Letter Transylvania Eastern Europe The Statuette South Atlantic OceanConnect the first three to form a triangle
Connect the other two and Pawtuxet to form a second triangle completing the Hexagram and opening the gates to the ancient cities
Connect the first three to form a triangle
Connect the other two and Pawtuxet to form a second triangle completing the Hexagram and opening the gates to the ancient cities
Use your map to go there and examine the pyramid that Edgar gave you at the outset to learn three symbols
They represent the settings for the three devices securing the entrance
Adjust the devices to match the symbols and a keyhole is revealed
Click the acute triangle five times the arc and lever two times and the broken circle four
The key you need is in the Alchemist's Briefcase
Use the key in the lock and the pyramid lock area is exposed
Place your pyramid in the center then pick up the other three pyramids to activate the entrance to the Ancient City
Find it at the small stone pyramid on the perimeter of the pentagram
Push the button on the pyramid to enter
Take note of the two symbols carved near the base of the pyramid before you go
Down the stairs are three passages
The left and right ones are dead ends
Take the middle one
Did I mention thatI HATE MAZES This one especially
The first part is not too bad says he who hates mazes just proceed downward until you come to a circular platform with four symbols on it
It's eight steps mostly forward
Three of the symbols point to tunnels you can take
If you enjoy foaming at the mouth and tearing your hair out by the handfuls go explore
Otherwise take the path indicated by this arrow shaped symbol
Actually the rightmost path is a short dead end and the other two connect behind the wall so it doesn't matter which way you start out I guarantee you will get equally lost either way
Anyway take three steps straight ahead to the flat wall and look right
Two hotspots here take theleftone
Three more steps and turnleftto see a round tunnel
Go there
Three steps straight ahead takes you across a stone crossing
Turn around and face the stone crossing
You can see the way you came
To the right of that is a complex area that looks like a triple tunnel but with only two hotspots
Take the right hotspot not the single tunnel further right
Three steps that way thengo down Two steps then take theleftof two choices
Three steps then look wayup Go over the hump lookdownagain to see a green door
That's the end of this maze
Go to the pedestal and look around the room
Straight ahead is an exit which is closed and to the right is a gate which is closed
Activate the pedestal
Solve the puzzle by pushing all the buttons in the middle column
The gate opens
Go to the right toward the three doors andactivate the timeron the left hand wall
The gate comes back down and the other exit opens but you can't get back to it
You must go full circle always using the middle door and arrive back where you started before two minutes elapses otherwise the gate re opens and the exit closes
You would need to repeat the sequence if that happens
As you return successfully to the pedestal room look left to find that exit still open and enter if before it slams shut
In the large round room study the images above the wall
Now lace up those walking shoes
It's a long way to go
Through the triangular tunnel the Great Spire comes into view
Doesn't look too big does it
That's because it's s o o o far away
Go forward four steps and find the ramp to your left and go down
Again left and again down until you finally come to a level area
Walk toward the spire you pass somebody who in the world was that
keep going and go all the way around to the back side to find the entrance it's about sixteen steps
Climb up and into the spire
Push a triangular button on the control panel to open the right hand corridor
The buttons are in the same sequence as the symbols on the wall in the large round room
Start with the top center the zig zag symbol
Go through there to the next control panel
Repeat the process five more times until you have come full circle again all the way around the perimeter of the spire goingcounter clockwise
If you must have the buttons they are top center bottom left top left bottom center top right and bottom right
When you are back where you started go into the left doorway and look for a new open door on your right
If you saw this door on your left as you arrived here fine
Just enter it
Enter the ante chamber
Place your three pyramids in the slots
If nothing happens just interchange them until it's solved
The sequence should you have studied it comes from the images in the round room
It's also the same sequence from the triangular buttons
When done you have opened another door
Go straight in until you come to several choices
You need to go around the diamond shaped column you are facing turn around and find the button on the back side of that column
Push it
Right behind you you have opened a low square doorway
Go in and find the spot with two buttons
There is another more roundabout way to get here but the little doorway is a shortcut
Push both buttons
Go ahead to the flat wall go right left left straight and look right
You are at a mechanical door with a button on either side
Push therightbutton then go through the opening next to the left button
Remember the routine we will be doing it four times the same way
F R R F L L L
Look right and do the same thing right button
L R F
Same thing
F R F
Look left to see the buttons
Same deal
F R F
STOP Save Your Game Here Please You are approaching the Final Conflict and it is a tightly timed puzzle

The NeverhoodWalkthrough byDan KennedyApril Introduction If style counted for everything The Neverhood Chronicleswould probably have been crowned king of adventure games long ago
Several tons of clay some of the most endearing adventure characters ever and a maniac musical soundtrack combine to makeThe Neverhoodone of the most unique and fun adventure games to tackle
But as we all know style only gets you so far
A relatively short game The Neverhoodis stocked full of puzzles that are decidedly mediocre at their worst a few puzzles cold be classified as mindless busywork seemingly inserted just to prolong gameplay
But the positives far outweigh the negatives here The Neverhoodis a funny engrossing game that ranks up there with some of the highest achievements of the genre
Good Morning
Shh
Klaymen is peacefully asleep on the floor of a bare room
Give him a tap with your mouse to wake him up
Once you are on your feet walk over to the button on the wall near the door and hit it
The window slides open click on it to walk over and look outside
The trees are green and all is quiet
Use the quot back quot arrow on the left or right edge of the screen to return to the normal view
Walk over to the lever on the left wall and pull it to smash the giant hammer into the door which buckles but does not break
Pull the lever two more times to knock the door into extinction
Now leave the room via the door
Feeding the Flytrap You stand atop a small platform on the left side of the new room
Several cords hang from the ceiling and there's a Venus flytrap contraption on the floor below the platform
Walk off the edge of the platform you bounce once and then fall directly into the mouth of the flytrap which spits you out a moment later
Clearly you aren't its favourite type of food
Walk below the cords and click on each of them to jump up and pull
The first three cords from the left don't seem to do much just a funny sound
Click again to fall back onto the floor
The fourth cord extends all the way to the floor when pulled and causes the door to open when the cord is let go the door closes again
The fifth cord causes a cowbell to sound when pulled but no changes are visible
Walk over to the door and click on the button oops sucker punch
We're going to have to get something to extend the fourth cord so that we can exit the door
Walk over to the top of the ladder and click on it to climb down
The ladder leads to a small balcony hanging in space
Proceed over to the mailbox and read the note inside it's a hint about what to do next from someone named Willie
Apparently the flytrap likes to eat rings
You automatically throw out the note in the waste paper basket
You can return here throughout the game to get hints when you are stuck on a puzzle
There's a continuous supply of notes from Willie in the mailbox but usually only the first provides any guidance on how to proceed in the game
Return up the ladder to the flytrap room click on the flytrap to stand beside it and give it a little push to the right
Keep clicking on it until you've shoved it all the way over so that it's directly below the th cord
Now grab the cord the flytrap gobbles it out of your hands and swallows the ring
The door is now open for you to leave the room
Welcome to the Neighbourhood Walk forward into the centre of the clearing here
Straight ahead there's a path leading to a red coloured building set into a large cliff
Pan to the right to see a yellow building then a purple swirly covered building then a light green building this is where you came from and then a red and yellow building with a narrow brown front door
Walk towards the narrow brown doors and click to go in
You can walk down a short staircase into a room below with a ceiling fan spinning round and round
Try clicking on the white button on the right wall this opens the front doors again allowing you to exit
Pick up the small square to be found on the floor in the centre of the room you'll store it in your chest for later
Click on the panel located to the left of the close door this is a slide puzzle that must show the letter quot H quot before the doorway to the right will open
Unfortunately I don't have any advice for you to solve the slider since this is the first of a number of puzzles in the game that area randomly generated each time the Neverhood is played
In this case the starting positions of the individual tiles are randomized
Adjacent pieces can be shifted to the quot blank quot space by clicking on them the brown tiles belong on the right side of the square and the blank tile can be placed in either the middle top or middle bottom positions
Good luck
After you've completed the quot H quot the door to the right opens click on the open doorway to go through
Pick up another square lying on the floor here and then click on the viewer on the centre wall of the room
These squares are actually disks that you can insert any of the viewers that you find during your explorations of the Neverhood
You will encounter a number of these viewers during the game and the disks that you've already inserted will always be present any viewer you access
Click the play button in the centre of the viewer and watch the movie contained on the first disks you've collected
You are introduced to Willie Trombone who has recorded some important information for you and stored it on the disks
The empty slots below the screen represent the disks that remain for you to find
The Long Walk After watching the disks back away from the viewer and click on the small hole on the right side of the room to turn it into a doorway at the expense of the left entrance
Click again to walk into the next room the Hall of Records
There is a large carved picture on the wall in here and the echoes indicate that this may be a room of considerable size
Click on the green button to turn the lights on and walk to the right
You will note some text carved into the wall here titled quot Preamble quot that can be read if you wish but it's not really essential to the story
It is however really really long
Start walking to the right you will need to cross about screens to get to the end
Unfortunately there's a disk located on the floor at the very end of the room plus a window that you can look out of
If you are interested in learning something about several of the characters you will encounter in the game such as Hoborg Willie and Bil there is a section titled quot Hoborg quot that is located about screens past the start of the Hall that contains some good background information it's only about three screens long
After you return from your long journey pick up the container located on the floor at the start of the text and then click on the button located next to the doorway blocked by horizontal spikes
The spikes retract allowing you to enter the room beyond
Shoot Out the Lights This small basement room is accessed by a very small elevated platform
Ride the platform to the floor of the room walk over to the button on the wall and press it
A humming noise greets you but nothing changes
Make sure you only hit the button once if you get a loud buzzing sound when you click you'll have to do it again
We'll see a little later on what this accomplished
Walk back to the platform get on it and click on the lever on the right wall
A movie illustrating a gun blowing the head off a large robot is looped on the wall
Click on the lever again to stop the movie and again on the opening near the ceiling to return to the room above
We've seen this room with the lights on how about with the lights off
Proceed back to the entrance to the Hall of Records and click the green button to shut off the lights
Now walk back to the entrance to the basement room
There appears to be a glowing green light coming from below so enter the basement room again
Three glowing green symbols now decorate the wall in here sketch out each of the three symbols since you'll need them for later
Return to the Hall of Records and exit to the left
Click on the viewer to insert your two new disks and watch the new material
Instead of reviewing everything each time try clicking on the disk that you want to view directly
It appears that Hoborg is the creator of this world
Walk to the small doorway to the left click to make it large again and proceed into the entrance room
Click on the white button on the right wall to open the front doors and exit the building
Between the Buttons Walk one step forward turn towards the low purple building one turn to the right and click forward to enter
You travel along a twisty darkened hallway and arrive at a locked door
Click on the door to get a close up view of the lock
One of the three buttons to the left has lit up click the middle button and the middle dead bolt unlocks
The button in the basement of the Hall of Records must have released the second dead bolt
Press either the top or bottom buttons neither the top nor the bottom dead bolt will open
We must find two more buttons that will unlock this door completely
Back up from the door turn around and proceed back to the central area between the buildings
Back in the clearing turn towards the yellow building the one to the left of the purple building and click forward
You can try clicking on the button to the right of the door but the door doesn't open
The tubes above the doorway chime a note ring but the other tubes to the right of the door each emit the same low note
It looks as though we will need to fix this doorbell
Try standing on the large button on the ground here nothing appears to happen
Walk back to the left towards the central clearing again
Kid Dynamite Turn to the right and walk towards the red building set into the side of a cliff
Enter the doors and examine your surroundings
A dummy made out of cylinders hangs from the ceiling the cylinders are either white quot DUD quot or red quot TNT quot
A number of white and red cylinders are stored on a shelf on the right side of the room and a viewing screen is located in the centre
There's a small item above the door to the right and a disk on the floor
Pick up the disk on the floor and click on the view screen
We get a schematic of the dummy and the extra cylinders displayed
The objective here is to switch all of the dud cylinders plain rectangles on the dummy for dynamite cylinders the ones with the wicks
The easiest way to accomplish this task is to click on the dummy's DUD cylinders until you've replaced them with the correct TNT ones
When you've got your dynamite man completed the dummy falls to the floor but doesn't do much else
Leave via the door on the right side of the room that item above the door is still unreachable
Burping and Screaming The next area you entered is open and brown
Walk forward and turn to your left
Proceed towards the tree and click again on the tree itself for a short movie showing Klaymen getting a bit gassy from eating one of the fruit
Click again to hear an even louder burp
Click a third time to hear the longest loudest raunchiest burp in adventure gaming history
Turn around and walk forward two steps to the brown double doors
Click to open the doors they reveal the head of an animal that appears identical to the one outside the yellow building with the doorbell
Click on the head water begins to flow out the mouth of the head
Turn around and walk back to the centre of the brown area
Turn to the right and walk two steps to the far wall
Press on the dark brown symbol on the wall straight ahead we catch a glimpse of an ugly green monster proceed with caution
Turn to your left and spot a music box sitting by the wall
Click to move towards it and watch a movie of Klaymen playing with the box and then running from the green monster which comes crashing through the wall after him
Klaymen eventually manages to make it back to the red building however the green beast is snapping its claws at us through the open door
The monster's actions eventually knock the item of the top of the doorway and onto the floor
Pick up the item it's a matchstick
Walk over to the snapping claw the monster manages to cut off our head but we've got another one available
Click on the dynamite man to light his fuse and then click again to push him into the monster's claw
The monster happily gobbles up the dummy and promptly explodes and apparently Willie gets a meal
Klaymen's Kar Exit the room via the right door again and proceed back to the monster's area
Turn to your left and walk through the smashed wall
You will see a red vehicle just ahead click to move towards it
You now get a view of Klaymen getting into a red foot shaped car like vehicle which runs along grooves cut into the clay cliff
The car is propelled forward by clicking ahead of the car in the direction you want it to move
Move the car to the right and enter the next screen OOPS looks like a dead end
Turn the car around return to the first screen and proceed into the groove that goes downward
The next screen contains a spiral groove with a button in the centre
Steer the car along the spiral to the centre and press the button if you're having difficulty the car is more easily controlled the closer you click to the front of the vehicle
Proceed back along the spiral and follow the groove back to the starting point
Click to the left of the car to get out
Walk forward one step turn to your right and return to the red building
Walk through the room and exit via the left door
Walk back along the path to the central clearing pan to the left and proceed to the yellow building with the doorbell
Target Spitting Now when you step on the large button on the ground water flows from the animal head to the left
Click on the water to fill up the container that you obtained from the Hall of Records and drink it down you must be quick about this action click on the button and then on the water flow as soon as it starts or the water will simply shut off
The objective of this exercise is to fill up the tubes to the right of the door so that they exactly imitate the tones of the doorbell
The tubes will contain different amounts of water the higher the tone the more water will have to be spat
Press on one of the tubes to the right of the door Klaymen spits the drink directly into the tube
What aim
Repeat these actions to fill up the tubes to the levels that you think will mimic the doorbell
The difficulty with this puzzle is that if you try to ring the doorbell and you don't have the amounts of water in the tubes matched exactly to the tones of the doorbell the tubes automatically dump out all of the water collected in them
This makes the puzzle incredibly tedious particularly if you have trouble with aural puzzles
Fear not the correct number of quot spits quot for the five tubes are starting from left spits spit spits spits and spits
Once you have the correct amount of waster in each tube ring the doorbell
The door opens the button will now always open the door since the tubes don't empty out when you finally solve the puzzle
Go ahead and enter the building
Buggin' Out A talking TV asks you a knock knock joke as you enter the room but you have no way of answering him so just ignore the boob
Pick up the disk on the floor here and have a peek out the window a small room is visible way above the red building
Back away and walk to the right
The other side of the room contains another disk and a viewer
Pick up the disk and click on the viewer to get caught up on the new disks to watch
Sneak a peek out the window to see a cannon
It looks as though there's a room above the one we're in right now but it is inaccessible at present
The retracted ladder looks identical to the spikes blocking the basement in the Hall of Records
We need to go back there and extend the spikes again
Walk over to the left and press the button to the right of the door to open it
Walk off to the left and go back to the yellow building with the narrow brown doors
Make your way back to the Hall of Records and press the button that extends the spikes blocking the basement doorway the button is just to the right of the basement opening
Now return to the entrance walk outside proceed back to the doorbell building ring the doorbell and go inside
Walk back over to the ladder and click on it to go up into the attic

Luckily it retreats back into the ceiling and we have a towel to clean up with
Sneak a peek out the window before you go
Walk back down the ladder exit the building and re enter the clearing
Pan to the left and walk into the low purple building
At the door click on each of the three glowing buttons to unlock all three of the dead bolts and open the door
Building Bridges Walk forward onto a brown clay bridge and look to your left you can see a bit of the lake below with water flowing in from the cliff face
Turn back to the right and continue across the bridge
Turn to your left and click on the video viewer
Pressing the red button below the screen causes a blue symbol to flash for a few seconds
You will need to sketch out all of these symbols in order keeping the following things in mind Watch the cycle several times until you have determined the proper order and the position of the noisy symbol
Back away turn around and walk towards and through the open doorway
You are standing on the left side of a small balcony with a piece of equipment to the right
Walk over to the equipment to look at it closer
You are now required to build a model of the clay bridge by placing the blocks strewn below onto the first block above in the proper order as determined by the carved symbol on each block
Place the wrong block onto your model and the whole thing collapses
Here's the order
An quot F quot block with the top branch of the F running parallel to the flat top of the block
An quot IP quot block quot with the IP slanted and the bubble of the P pointed at the block's top
A quot BB quot block with the B's bubbles pointed up towards the top of the block
An quot F quot block with the F's branches pointing up towards the top of the block
An quot IP quot block with the P's bubble pointing down towards the round bottom of the block
A quot BB quot block with the B's bubbles pointed down towards the bottom of the block
An quot F quot block with the F's branches pointing down towards the bottom of the block
A quot BB quot block with the B's bubbles pointed to the side
The last remaining quot IP quot block Once the model is finished press the end of the bridge it tries to fold down but the quot water quot underneath pushes it back up
Nothing more to do here for now
Back away and exit the balcony
Big Gun Outside the room turn to the left and click on the base of the cannon
Once you're settled in take a peek into the target viewer
You have to input two sets of three symbols in order to choose the correct target
We have already found the three vertically stacked symbols to the left in the darkened basement of the Hall of Records
Click on the left and or right arrow buttons to find the three symbols that match the ones you collected from the basement
Once the correct symbols have been entered they are locked into place
We do not however yet have the three horizontal symbols over to the right so we don't have anything to put in on the other input device
Try pressing the big red button on the left anyway hellip and watch the havoc we've caused
Our cannon shot hits the cliff which dislodges rocks that block the flow of water into the lake
The water drains out the lake into a large drain pipe revealing a previously submerged yellow building at one end of the lake
Back away from the target view and turn to the left to face the doorway to the balcony again
Proceed onto the balcony and walk over to the bridge model
Press the end of the model bridge and watch it fold completely down into a staircase
Back away from the model and leave the balcony
Under the Sea Outside the balcony room move forward one step turn to the left and walk forward as expected the bridge has turned into a staircase leading down to the bottom of the lake
Walk down the stairs Klaymen decides to take the quick way down and turn to your right
Walk forward to the large drain with the warning signs
You are standing in front of the only way to die in the Neverhood click on the drain and Klaymen falls down through the Neverhood and out the bottom I advise you not to do this or at least save your game before trying it
Instead turn to your right walk towards a green Klaymen Kar and get in
It's time to explore the quot side quot of the lake
Propel the car upwards and go left at the T intersection in the groove
Follow the groove off to the left then up and to the right a bit
You reach a dead end at a funny looking radio playing a crazy sounding song with a cow bell ringing every so often
Very curious make sure you can recognize this song again before retracing your steps all the way back to the first groove intersection
Follow the groove to the right then up and back towards the left
At the next fork you can go up or continue left choose the quot up quot option and follow this groove over to the right and then down
Stop at the test tubes located to the right blue red and green liquids are shown and record the level and colour of liquid in each tube
Continue along this groove it weaves its way back to the left and then dead ends near the lake bottom
Return past the test tubes back to the left up fork and go off to the left this time
Pretty soon you will encounter another quot left or up quot fork choose the quot up quot option and follow this groove until it ends just below the position of the cannon
Read the plaque here it's quot The Cannon Monument quot and mentions that quot This cannon was put here by Hoborg quot
Someone has scratched out Hoborg's name and written quot Klogg quot underneath
Return to the left up fork and go left this time
Follow this groove over to the left then up up up all the way up past the red building to the top of a tower
Click on the small window here to peek into the room this appears to be Willie's bedroom
Have a look around and then return along the groove in the Kar
Remember to take the right option at the two forks you will come to and go down at the fork close to the start of the wall maze
Get out of the car walk forward a step turn to the left and walk forward to the yellow building with the satellite dish on top
Radio Radio Enter the yellow building through the front door and pick up the disk on the floor
There is a closed door over to the right and a radio set into the wall it looks very similar to the one on the lake wall we saw a little while ago
Click on the radio for a close up it's dark and silent
How do we turn on the radio
What was the other sound we heard from the wall radio
A cow bell just like the one that sounds when we pull the right most cord in the flytrap room
We'll need to travel back there and pull the cord
Exit the yellow building walk forward and turn to your right to go up the stairs
At the top walk forward turn to the right and enter the balcony
Walk over to the bridge model and press on the end of the bridge to raise it up
Now leave walk forward turn to the left and cross the bridge again
Proceed straight through the purple building and walk into the main clearing
Pan to the left until you are facing the light green building and enter
Pull the rightmost cord listen for that cow bell and leave again
Walk forward and pan to the right to face the purple building
Enter press the three buttons on the door to unlock the dead bolts and walk onto the bridge again
Cross the bridge turn to the right enter the balcony and lower the bridge model again
Leave the balcony walk forward turn to the left and descend the staircase
Turn to the left and reenter the yellow building
Click on the radio it's now on and squawking
We've got to find the setting that will play the same song as we hear from the radio on the wall
Rotate the dial clockwise by clicking to the right of the big red arrow
Keep clicking until the correct song is playing go slowly so that you don't miss it
When you've found the song back away from the radio the front door is closed but the door to the right should be open
Incredibly Shrinking Klaymen Walk into the darkened room and click on the window not much of a view here
Now click on the orange glassy looking item located to the right of the window another three test tubes filled with orange purple and yellow liquids
Again note the colour and level of the liquids in each tube
Back away and proceed down the stairs to the room's main floor
Pull the cord on the right side of the room to turn on the lights
We've got a large glass cylinder to the left with quot BOBBY quot scratched into the side and what appears to be a miniature room to the left of the bottom of the stairs
Enter the glass cylinder and try pushing the grey buttons below the five diamonds the five stones spin around but nothing seems to happen
Nothing much happens when the red button is pressed either
Perhaps we need to turn off the lighting in here
Walk back out into the room pull the cord to turn off the lights and then return to the glass cylinder
Try pressing the red button now a laser shoots out from the left lighting up each the five stones
Try pressing some of the white buttons and then the red button again now some of the stones will have changed colour when hit by the laser but still nothing really happens
What colours should we set the stones to be so that something happens
What about the word scratched into the side of the cylinder BOBBY
Try changing the colours of the stones from left to right toBlue Orange Blue Blue andYellow
Since you aren't able to see what colour you've changed the stone to until you fire the laser the easiest way to find the right settings is to press each of the five white buttons once and check the colours of all five stones by hitting the red button
If any of the stones have turned the right colour don't press that button again
Once you've achieved the correct combination there's a giant flash and you are miniaturized
Walk over to the very small room to the left of the stairs and click to enter
There is a liquid dispenser located in the middle of the counter in here with orange yellow and purple liquids available
Fill the containers to match the amounts in the larger versions to the right of the window by clicking on the appropriate coloured knob
Once finished click on the red lever to mix the concoction and drink it if you get the mixture wrong Klaymen shows his displeasure
It isn't long before you are big again
The only problem that exercise didn't really accomplish anything
Go back into the glass cylinder zap yourself small again just hit the red button and run over to the right side of the stairs where there is a small doorway here
This leads to a ramp that takes you all the way up to another doorway located immediately left of the barred window
Click on this doorway to pass through
A Little History You find yourself in a blue room filled with statues with another tiny lab located over to the right
Walk over to the lab and mix up a concoction by clicking on the coloured knobs that consists of red blue and green liquids in the amounts that were in the test tubes on the lake wall
Hit the red lever to mix the liquids and drink the concoction
You are life sized again
There is an opening on the ceiling but we don't currently have a way of reaching it
Pick up the disk on the floor and the have a look at some of the statues along the walls
Pay particular attention to the statues on the right side of the room and find the one situated directly in front of a window
Click on the ball situated in the centre of its head and a ladder descends from the ceiling allowing access to the room above
Click on the ladder to climb up
The room above contains a viewer a door in the back a disk on the floor and a pull cord
Click on the viewer to get rid of your recently collected disks and watch the movie
We are introduced to Klogg who looks a lot like we do
Only nine more disks to go
Walk out the exit to the back and climb into the strange looking vehicle
Click on the control panel to get a close up it consists of a large red button on the left and six smaller buttons on the right arranged in a circle
A flashing button indicates a location we can transport to but only one of these buttons is flashing right now the red one with the nail on it
Hit this smaller red nail button and then the larger one to the left and we are transported away
Worlds Colliding We arrive at a barren brown location get out of the car and pan around
All of the Neverhood is spread out below for us to see you can spot some of the places you have already visited
Turn back to the left and click on the giant nail attached to a chain that leads back to the Neverhood
We struggle with it while an ugly creature watches us from a window of a tall building
Could this be Klogg but he's so mutated and ugly
Finally we get the nail out and the Neverhood slowly drifts back together evidently it had been split apart at some point
Note that the groove located near where the beastie attacked us is now connected to another path we'll have to return there later on to see where it now leads to
Once the show is over turn around and get back into the car again
Now two buttons are flashing since the green one will take us back to the first transporter click on the orange button and we are transported away
We arrive in a pink coloured room with a large carved drawing on the wall
Hop out of the transported and scoop up the two disks on the floor
It's a little tricky getting out of this room since the door only opens for a few moments after the button on the floor is pressed the door is rudely slammed in your face if you miss it
After you step on the button immediately click on the open doorway to get out as fast as you can it may take you a few attempts so keep trying
Ready to Order Turn to your right and walk towards the small house straight ahead
Click on the house several times to get a series of rude messages telling you to go away
Oblige the hermit by turning around and walking back to your original location
Turn to your right and take several steps forward through the short tunnel and out the other side
Turn to your right several times until you are facing the short viewer located immediately to the left of the tunnel's entrance
Walk to the viewer and click for a close up
You will have to pull out your notes that you made back at the viewer near the cannon
As the symbols scroll through their cycle click on the appropriate symbol to place it in order from left to right according to your notes
When you get to the position of the quot noisy quot symbol put whichever of the symbols here that is making that same noise
Once you've completed the correct order the viewer swings back revealing a red room with a disk on the floor
Pick up the disk and note the groove track over on the right side of the room perhaps we'll be returning here later in the game
Exit the room and walk back towards the centre of the current area you are in
The Perfect Memory Turn to your left and walk towards the mustard coloured building with the purple door
Enter the building and look around we've got a mouse munching on a piece of cheese below a big black tube
Press the button on the floor to see the tube in action apparently it's a large vacuum system that has sucked the mouse and his snack off to a new location
Walk past the vacuum tube to the right and enter the next room
Pick up the disk on the floor in here and the play the viewer to catch up on the new episodes
Now walk over to the large panel on the right hand side of the room
Try clicking on some of the tiles on the panel this is just like a kid's memory card game where you match up pairs of identical symbols
Yes except that the entire board becomes covered up again after you mess up only one pair of symbols
This obviously requires you to patiently map out the identity and location of all of the tiles on the panel
After mapping out the entire panel carefully turn over each matched pair once you are done spend a bit of time and count up the number of times each of the ten symbols appears on the panel this will become very important later in the game
Very Cheesy Exit this room to the left and walk across the entrance room off to the left
A large black box blocks your way on a small bridge click on the box to get a close up of the situation
You must steer the mouse to his cheese in the bottom right corner by choosing holes for him to go through
The game board is mapped out below the holes numbers are in red and the location of where the door leads you to is shown inside each hole
Follow this pattern to get you to the end really quickly The black box slowly disappears into the ground leaving the way to the left open
Walk to the left and enter the room with what looks to be cheese stuck to the wall
Pick up the two new disks in here and then walk to the left of the weird looking machine
Click on the machine to push it to the right give it a couple of pushes until it drops into an electrical outlet on the floor
Pull the lever on the right an upside down slide of Klogg is displayed on the wall
Click again to turn off the projector walk around to the left side again and start pushing it to the right
Push it across the screen across the bridge and into the front entrance room
Position it directly over the vacuum tube and press the floor button to shoot it off to another place
Hit the button on the wall to open the front door and leave this building
Spin That Wheel Proceed forward into the centre of the clearing before you pan to the left and walk towards the red building with pink dots
Enter the doorway and watch Klaymen try to twist the small scale model of the building
This causes the entire building to twist down on its axis making the flat area beyond the house accessible
Unfortunately it's at the expense of that little green creature
Turn around the house has twisted back to its original position preventing us from going back
Face forward again and walk towards the brown building straight ahead
Klaymen enters the room and immediately stumbles into a hole in the floor
A friendly little purple guy comes out and finishes the job knocking us all of the way through the hole
We land in a darkened cavern with three green symbols on the wall a disk on the floor and another transporter
Copy down the symbols these are the remaining symbols we'll need to operate the cannon
Pick up the disk on the floor and get into the transporter
Have a look at the control panel now four of the buttons are blinking
The red takes us to the tiny platform above the Neverhood the orange takes us to the pink room the green takes us above the radio room and the blue button is a new one
Hit the blue button and be zapped away
Teasing Teddy Get out of the new transporter and walk to the left the game switches to first person perspective
Walk forward through the tunnel until you reach the wall ahead
You may hear Willie's voice calling for help from somewhere above
Turn to your right and walk towards a panel located on the low wall ahead
When you get close enough hit the red button below the panel it opens to reveal several buttons and pictures
There's a drawing of a teddy bear hanging from a structure in the top right corner and three of the symbols from the memory game are shown below it
Use the arrow keys to input the correct number of occurrences for each of the three symbols on the memory game panel the value is displayed on a die
Now hit the big yellow button if you've inputted the correct numbers the arm holding up the bear swings around so that a large robot trapped in an enclosed area can look at it through a round window
Back away from the panel turn around and walk forward
Turn to your left and walk back to the transporter
Get in and press the green button to be taken back to the transporter located on the top of the radio building
A Little Backtracking We need to go back to the Klaymen Kar on the other side of the dynamite dummy building to investigate the new groove created when the Neverhood was pushed back together
Walk back into the building and use the viewer to catch up on any of the newly created disks you may not have seen yet
Once completed grab the cord hanging from the ceiling this takes you all the way down to the miniaturizing room
Walk back up the stairs and enter the radio room
Click on the radio for a close up and turn the dial counter clockwise back to its starting point click to the left of the red needle

Get back into the kar and return to the starting point
Kill Bil Get out of the car and make your way back to the clay bridge via the red and purple buildings
Re cross the bridge turn to the right take a step forward and turn to your right
Click on the cannon to access the targeting system
Enter the three symbols that you copied down from the wall of the darkened cavern into the three horizontal spots on the right of the panel
Once you get the correct symbols the arrow buttons disappear
Now we must position the gun with the coordinates we entered
Click on the small white arrow at the bottom of the vertical target line in the middle of your screen
We watch the gun platform raise up into the sky
Now hit the small white arrow on the very left of the horizontal target line
The gun pans around until it faces the hole that the large robot is looking through at his Teddy
Hit the red button on the left we literally blow the head off the robot
To return to the ground first click on the horizontal white arrow now at the right end of the horizontal target line and then the vertical white arrow now at the top of the vertical target line
Back on the ground back away from the gun turn to your left and enter the balcony
Lower the stairs once more exit the balcony walk forward turn to your left and descend the clay stairs to the bottom of the lake
Turn to your left walk to the radio building and enter
Kill Bil Part Two Adjust the radio to your special song and reenter the miniaturizing room
Re miniaturize yourself in the bubble and walk up the ramp to the sculpture room
Use the little lab to make yourself big again and climb the ladder up to the top room
Exit the room at the back and climb into the transporter
Use the blue button to transport back to where you blew up the robot's head
Get out of the transporter walk over to the left through the tunnel and turn to the right
You are now treated to an extended movie that involves Klaymen resetting the robot from BAD to GOOD the rescue of Willie from a monster and the theft of Bil the Robot's teddy bear by Klogg's thugs
Bil manages to open the door to the Neverhood palace and you are able to get inside but Klogg sets off the cannon remotely and Bil and Willie are knocked out into space
Putting Klogg to Good Use Inside the palace walk forward turn to your left and proceed towards the doorway shaped like a monster's jaws
Enter the room behind the doorway
So this is where the vacuum tube brought the mouse and the projection machine
Pick up the disk on the floor only one more to go
Walk over to the right side of the room and click on the panel here you will see a board with numbered keyholes in it
We've already found something that looked kind of like a key but we don't have a way of putting it into the board
Back away and examine the drawing on the wall near the projector
It seems to show three keys on it but the right side of the picture is obscured by darkness
Walk over to the left of the projector and click on it to give it a shove to the right
Repeat this until the projector falls into another floor plug like the one in the cheese room Hit the lever on the projector's right side to display the slide of Klogg and illuminate the rest of the drawing of the keys
The drawing shows three keys the F shaped one the single loop one and the double loop one and which keyholes each of the three keys should be inserted into
Since we only have one of the three keys we'll have to come back later
Key Exchange Exit the room to the left and then walk forward to the centre of the palace room
Turn to your left and walk towards the balcony
Enter the balcony and pick up the pin lying on the floor here
There's one of the two missing keys hanging from a string above the balcony but we cannot reach it right now
Exit the balcony and reenter the palace
Walk forward pan to the right twice and then walk towards the elevator door
Enter the elevator and watch it take you up to the second floor
There's a transporter a disk on the floor and a viewer waiting for you on this level
Pick up the disk and insert it into the viewer
All of the disks should now be blinking since you have collected all
The entire movie will now play be sure to patiently watch the whole thing once again
After the movie is done Willie comes back on screen and eventually tosses out a key for you
You must watch the whole movie to get the key
Back away from the viewer and pick up the key that's now on the ground
Walk to the window over on the right side of the room and look out
That hanging key is being held up by a balloon
Click on the balloon and Klaymen pops it with the pin you picked up on the balcony
Walk back into the room press the down button to the right of the elevator get into the elevator and go down to the ground floor
Outside the elevator walk forward turn to your left twice and walk out onto the balcony
Pick up the third key and walk back into the palace
Walk forward turn to the right a little and proceed towards the jaws door
Inside the key room approach the key panel on the right wall
The three keys you've collected are all here
To place them in the correct holes click on each key and click on the keyhole you want to place it in
Once all keys are correctly placed the panel slides back to reveal a doorway
Walk through into the next room
Fly Trap We've walked into a room much like the one just outside of where we woke up
There's a flytrap in here and cords hanging from the ceiling
Pull each of the cords the first third and fifth from the left do nothing the second lowers the bridge on the right and the fourth lowers the spikes that block our path on the other side of the bridge
You can try pushing the flytrap beneath the second or fourth cords and letting it swallow the ring but you can only get the beast to either lower the bridge or the spikes not both at once
We need a way of getting us over both barriers at the same time
Perhaps the flytrap can help
Position the flytrap below the fifth cord from the left now grab the cord and hang there for a moment
Finally click on the flytrap to drop down you end up in the belly in the beast which kindly spits you across the barriers into the next room
In the red and white room walk over to the door on the right side and click to go in
The Final Choice As we enter Klogg pops us and gives a quick introduction
We are given a shot of the throne room with Hoborg sitting motionless on the throne
Klogg tells us that he wants Klaymen to be the king and hands us the crown to put on
Since you can't give the crown back to Klogg you have two choices put the crown on your own head or put it on Hoborg's head
If you watched the disk movie you saw how the crown mutated Klogg into a hideously hating beastie
Its not much of a stretch to see that giving the crown back to Hoborg is the right thing to do if you are interested in seeing what happens if Klaymen crowns himself save your game and test it out later
For now click on Hoborg to give the crown to him
That's it hellip Klogg gets what he deserves Hoborg populates his land and even Willie and Bil show up for the finale

I went into the building with the figure hanging from the ceiling and the weird t v
set looking thing what do I do
The strange t v like device that cuts to a close up when clicked on shows a representation of the hanging dynamite man figure on the left side of the screen and the dynamite shelves on the right side the screen
The object of the puzzle is to replace the duds on the dynamite man with the real dynamite sticks on the shelves
You can do this by clicking on the squares on the figure that do not have fuses little squiggles on the top of each block
Keep clicking until a fuse appears on the top of each block

I keep clicking on the radio but it doesn t do anything
Why
You must go and turn it on by going back to the place where you woke up at the beginning of the game and pull the correct ring if you haven't already done so that s why we suggested you give them each a tug when you were there the first time
There is a hint for this on the wall of lake floor which can be found by riding the green putt putt car

If you set the radio to the station a certain song it will open the door to the lab The audio hint for this is on the lake floor wall with the hint about turning on the radio
I am in the room with the big glass dome and I went inside and pushed the buttons but nothing happened
Help me
When the lights are on you will see the name Bobby on the outside of the Machine
Turn the lights off and go back inside the Machine
The letters in the name correspond to the colors in the spectrum of visible light that you learned about back in high school
For those of you that skipped school that day it went something like this ROYGBV
R stands for red O stands for orange and so forth
Make the crystals in the Machine the same colors as the letters in Bobby When you come back out again you should be little
I am in the little green lab what do I do
Leave and go up the stairs through the little door to the next room
I am in the little purple lab what do I do
Make yourself big by entering the correct proportions of the liquids into the beakers
The correct proportions can be found by taking the car on the lake floor to the area outside the lab with the three beakers and noting the levels of each liquid
This is different for each game
I am back in the little green lab because I do not know the correct proportions for the liquids in the little purple lab
I am mad so tell me what to do
You will need to look at the levels of the liquids in the beakers at the top of the stairs and fill the beakers in green with the corresponding amounts
You will now be big again
I am in the room with all the statues and columns and I am big but there are no doors
How do I get out
On the right side of the room one of the statues looks like a head with a ladder sticking out of it
Behind it there is a button
Push it and a ladder will fall from the ceiling
I made the worlds collide and now I have teleported myself to a pink room but the door keeps hitting me in the face
How do I get out
Run
I found another one of those things that when I press the red button a bunch of symbols shows up
How do I solve this one magic eight ball
The first one that you saw holds the solution to this one
You need to go back and note the order of the symbols at the first location and then enter them in the same order at the second location
The trick here is that the second location contains one extra symbol and the first location repeats one symbol and makes a strange sound
While at the second location you will need to put the extra symbol in the place where the first location repeated
Get it
The order is different for each game
I am in the room with the noisy mouse and a big yellow button on the floor

I am in the red room staring at a white wall with little squares on it
The squares have pictures on them what do I do
This puzzle is like the game memory only harder
You need to flip the pieces and match them up in pairs
If you miss one they will all flip back over so write them down
I am looking at a panel that has three pictures with a numbered block next to each and a bear hanging from a pole above it
I am confused
Dear confused you need to change the number on the block to equal the number of that item that was pictured in the red room at the memory puzzle and then press the yellow button
The little bear on the arm should swing to the other side
I moved the bear and the robot went after it but what do I next Go to the cannon and shoot Robot Bil in the head
I went to the cannon again but I just keep shooting the wall You need to enter the correct symbols into the cannon to raise it and move it over to Robot Bil
The symbols can be found in the Hall of Records basement where you pressed the blue button

I just shot Robot Bil am I in trouble
No
Go back and see how he is doing
I went into this room through a big toothy door and that noisy mouse is in here what do I do
Well walk over to the right and click on the purple door
If you have the three keys Klaymen will put them into the holes on the puzzle
Now you must put them in the proper order
Where do I get the Three Keys
The first key is on the balcony of the castle The second key can be acquired by taking the putt putt car in the cave where the weasel lived to the room at the end of the track The third key is given to you automatically after you have placed all twenty of the story disks into any video player
Ifound disks
Where the hoozitz is the last one
You will need to walk all the way to the end of the Hall of Records
The disk is on the floor
Mean huh
that s why we suggested you pick it up when you were there
I am on the balcony and there is a key floating up above me
How do I get it
Pick up the pin on the ground and then take the elevator inside the castle up to the Telepod room
Look out the window
Click on the balloon and pop it
Go back down to the balcony and pick up the key
I am in a room with more rings and another one of those pesky flytraps
What now
You need to push the flytrap over to the area just below the last ring on the right Jump up and grab the ring
When you let go the trap will eat you and then spit you into the next room
How do I know the correct order of the Three Keys
You need to have pushed that goofy looking thing with the handle that you saw in the room with the butter pat on the wall over to the vacuum and stepped on the yellow button to suck it up
Then you need return to the castle and it will be there
Push it over to the right just a little bit and the top of it will turn toward the wall
Pull the handle and zowie there s the answer
Put the keys in the proper holes and the door will open
Complete these puzzles collect the videos and the last of the mysteries will be revealed in a stunning climax
Take heed you will be affecting your own destiny and the entire future of the Neverhood
Bonus Hints and Cheats Frequently visiting your mailbox located below the Flytrap room will yield new clues to help you solve the next puzzle
Save often so if you exit you can get back to where you were without re playing the whole game

A UHS File andat leasttwo good walkthrus onThe Neverhoodare posted on various Sites Many of the puzzles are fairly easy but one or two of the solutions are somewhat obscure Hence I add below some further details and clarificationsfor any who may need or want them They may serve as an addition to the abovementioned much fuller Helps If you arereallystuck my recommendation is to try the UHS File or one of the walkthrus If this is insufficient you may
find the solution to your problem below 'Saves' are not stored in the usual folders or sub folders but in the Registry of Windows This makes it more cumbersome to store them permanently on diskettes or whatever or help somebody out by sending them on Unless you are quite experienced with manipulating 'Registry Keys' I recommend not playing around with this mechanism
A randomizer built into the game altersmanyparameters making it impossible to give complete spoilers formanypuzzles In fact each time the game is started or sometimeseven when returning to a'Save'in your same game these parameters change So in the majority of cases only general procedural solutions can be given
A very minor issue During the fairly early part of the game you have to open a door which is locked with dead bolts controlled by buttons colored reddish blue and brown To do this you have to search all over the territory and click buttons in different locales colored orange blue andgleaming white A bit of a cop out IMO especially when you don't know what you're doing or why
Quite valid but caused me a fair bit of wasted time and trouble In many Quest Adventures you have to press a button or click a switch etc in order to progress To date as far as I can remember once you have done this and happen to return to thesame button it is either completely inert or beeps or whatever but causesnofurther action or progress or hindrance
But in this game you have to be VERY careful Some buttons etc
work on a flip flop or toggle principle like a light switch If you click once you have achieved the objective although you frequently don't know that since you can'tseeit because it's alongway away
But if you're not certain which happened to me more than once and click a second time 'just to be sure'
you havenegatedyour first action and when you tramp way back to wherever you've gained absolutely nothing Putting it a different way if you clickanyodd number of times fine but if you click any even number of times
zilch
This is rather tough since there is sometimes no obvious connection between the switching action and its distant objective Possibly the most blatant example is the specific case of the switches affecting the abovementioned 'distant' dead bolts A correct pressdoescreate a soft echoing musical tone whereas a 'wrong' press causes a louder rasping buzzer sound You are presumably meant to grasp that the former is required and not the latter I however did not catch on One of the most infuriating aspects of Neverhood is the Hall of Records Library where you are expected to read or are you
a large number of pages or clay tablets which is extremely tedious Klayman moves rather slowly and the majority of the nearly 'sections' contains separate pages each of which has to be scrolled individually Unless I miscounted there are pagesin all Whether you decide to read them or not you canreadilyskip all or part of them
you MUST get right to the end since there is one item you MUST acquire there in order to finish the game Then Klaymanhasto plod his weary way back to the very beginning no quick or easy exit I scanned themallsuperficially and to me they seemed to have little tangible bearing on the plot of the game certainly no puzzle clues of any importance For those whoareinterested the first half at least seems to bear some similarity to the early chapters of the Old Testament
In one section of the game I became more than normally confused and in case this happens to anybody else the scenario and a short explanation follow After Klayman becomes tiny he has to exit the room I found this a bit tricky since the room is dark and the small Klayman moves somewhat jerkily Near the bottom right corner of the screen is a small exit not too obvious due to the darkness Click on this Then click on the large barred window near center screen and little Klayman will walk to just beneath it and look out Then click just a very little to the left of where he is standing and he will exit left to the 'striped column and statues' room In order to achieve ANYTHING hereyou first have to return him to full normal size To do this you have to fill the Red Green Blue measuring cylindersaccording to what you saw hopefully on your putt putt car travels What added to my confusion was the Orange Yellow Mauve cylinders which Klayman can view to the right of the abovementioned window These enable Klayman to return to normal size in order to exit the radio room and doubtless return again later
AFAIK you shouldONLYuse these if you have failed to find or note the Red Green Blue measurements otherwise I believe they are completely redundant and only confuse the issue
The Mouse Cheese puzzle I managed to solve this myself by trial and error but it took me some time andmany'moves' Then out of interest I peeked at one or more of the abovementioned walkthrus and there I noticed clues such as get the mouse to follow its nose etc To clarify this a little Each time the mouse emerges from a hole its nose will be pointing either left or right Click on thespace not the hole
next to the direction its nose is pointing The mouse will jump towards this space Sometimes its nose willstillbe pointing in the same direction but sometimes in the opposite direction Either way enter the hole to which its nose is pointingNOW In just movesevery time the mouse eats the cheese and you're on your way
Another puzzle held me up for a considerable while N B As mentioned previously there are random differences inmanyof the puzzles sometimes even when you replay themyourselfin the same 'game' Thiscertainlyappliesto this puzzle
About half way through the game afteryou have traveled to the location where you have to exit a very rapidly closing door there is a panel in which symbols have to be 'frozen' from left to right The process starts with the single left hand position which projects a continuous series of symbols ending with one that is differentiatedonlyby the fact that every time it appears you hear a sort of zither ey sound This final symbol is likely to be a different one of the every time you play or replay the game
Let us call this symbol X Then this same sequence repeats itself over and over again When you press the red button during the short period of time that any symbol is displayed that particular symbol is frozen in place Then the nd position from the left repeats the same process the zither ey sound is always a signal that one series is ending and an identical one is about to start and then the rd position and so on You continue this process until all the sites are filled with symbols Only if you have gotall correct have you solved the puzzle and continue to the next stage of the game if you make one single mistake you startthewholeprocessagain from the very beginning which is pretty time consuming and frustrating Butwhatis the correct sequence of symbols Opposite the cannon earlier on is a similar panel which projects one single symbol each time you press a red button It remains on screen for about seconds and unless you have a phenomenal memory I can't think of any alternative but to make a rough sketch of each of the symbolsand in their correct order or maybe use some lettering system
The order isdifferentfrom the abovementioned one Since it's quite likely that you won't have time to make adequate sketches first go you can repeat this process as many times as you need to In factit's worth repeatingin any casesince you'll notice an interesting and vital phenomenon there are only differentsymbolshereand one of the symbols always a different one but always one of the is alwaysrepeatedbut in the same'position' Since I personally found this somewhat puzzling I'll make it a bit clearer Although your sequence might be different I'm pretty sure that the sameprincipleapplies In one particular case calling the symbols opposite the cannon A thro' L I found that the sequence A L wasidentical every timeexceptforE The first 'time round' E was the same symbol as G the next time it was the same symbol as J the next time D and so on Returning to the 'original'puzzle panel The ONLY correct sequence you must 'freeze' here from left to right is the abovementioned near cannon sequence A thro' L EXCEPTthat when you get to E or whatever in your case you must instead freeze the 'special' symbolXmentioned above Hope it's clear
Simple if you know what you're doing almost impossible if you don't one false move out of the and I recommend that you start from the beginning again or you'll waste alotof time
There is one puzzle which is very easy and obvious what is possibly a bit less obvious is that one aspect of it is necessary for a later albeit even easier puzzle
Puzzle a This is only a slightly more complicated variation on the familiar pairs memory puzzle You are presented with an x matrix of tiles I suggest drawing a grid of columns and rows As you click on the visible blank back of any tile it flips over and reveals a symbol Sometimes near the beginning you are lucky and when you click again you get the same symbol but generally not and the two flip back again this however is of negligible importance In whichever way you prefer you have to identifyeveryone of the symbols which doesn't take long On your grid mark each symbol I found it quickest and easiest to call one which looked like a mustache M a radio R a fire hydrant F a skull S and so on When you have done this it is important to count andnote all your M's R's F's S's etc Each of the many times I have played this game I personally got sets of the identical symbols maybe different in your case but each time the positions and numbers of symbols in each set was quitedifferent I imagine that the onlycertaintiesare that each set must be an even number and that the total must be You then start again from the beginning withanysymbol you like say R but you MUST then 'pair' it with a second R You then chooseanyother symbol say S or preferably R if there are any left and so on until the end Again ONE slip up i e
an 'un paired couple' and you start again from the very beginning but the symbols remain identical and in their same positions so it's nottootime consuming
Puzzle b Later you come across a panel with only out of the or whatever of thesamesymbols that you found in Puzzle a Next toeachof these symbols is a sort of dice set to pip By clicking on the red up arrows below these 'dice' you simply increment each of the down arrows decrement the pips to the number of tiles in Puzzle a which had that particular symbol which is an additional good reason why you had to count andretaineach set in Puzzle a You then click the circular yellow button above and that's it VERYeasy
When you reach the end of the game or almost you should have video cassettes in your video cassette player However each time I've played the game I've missed one there could be more than one missing It would be very convenient if the empty space s in your cassette player simply 'directed you to' the particular cassette s missing e g
Theoretically only
It would be nice if you were to know that IF say you find that the th slot from the left is empty this woulddefinitelymean that you have not acquired the specific cassette say 'beneath the radio' Unfortunately however it does not seem possible to compile a simple list relating the positions of the cassette slots on the video cassette player to the locations where the cassettes are to be found It appears that there is some built in random factor at work coupled with the particular but different order in which each person picks up the cassettes It seems that the best that can be done is to list the locations in which all cassettes are situated If you are missing one or more with luck this list may remind you of a location where youdid notpick up a cassette Failing this you just have to visit the locations listed below until you find your missing cassette s The following list isroughlyin the order of locations in which the cassettes will generally be encountered
A Across the first green bridge In the room with the TNT figure In the Hall of Records Library B Just inside the entrance C After the slider puzzle in the adjoining room D To the right switch on the light to the right again open the spines down the elevator E At thevery endof theextremelylong hall In the Water spitting musical pipes cottage F In the first room you enter beneath the TV set G In the adjacent room one screen to the right of this H Up the 'spine ladder' and into the upper floor After draining the lake descending the stairs in the yellow house with the antenna and radio I Just inside the house itself below the radio J After turning into mini Klayman and then back again to normal in the room with blue striped pillars and statues K After obtaining and climbing the ladder in the upper room In the Second World that you enter through the door that closes VERY quickly
L amp M cassettes In the purple room beforeyou exit the rapidly closing brown door N In the light brown house with the darker brown front door down through the hole in the floor in the dark room below O After solving the symbols puzzle the door in the wall opened in the orange colored room with bars P In the light brown house with the purple door right past the mouse and near the pairs memory puzzle Q amp R cassettes Back and left past the entrance door and the mouse cheese puzzle to the next room with the projector In and around Klog's house S Up in the red elevator to the next floor in the purple room between the transporter and the cassette player T Inside the room with the dark purple door with the projector and the mouse
Caution Be rather careful in acquiring the rd 'free' key near the end Explanation When you have got all video cassettes you 'receive' this keyautomatically I made a bit of a mess of this I would advise saving BEFORE you pop the th cassette into any video cassette machine If everything is OK when you insert the last cassette s all cassettes automatically flash on and offcontinuously previously only the extreme left hand cassette lights upautomaticallyunless you click another and then you have to click the trigger above to start any batch off In this 'final' case however Willie Trombone then automatically relates thewholestory from the beginning through to the end with no interruptions You MUST wait right through until he finishes afterthe end he then adds anadditionalshort spiel and throws the rd key out of the video screen and at you and you simply pick it up from the floor below the video set Since I had heardmanydifferent segments of the storysomanytimes during the course of the game I didn't have the patience to listen yet again to the whole thing which takes over minutes from start to finish So as far as I can remember I guess I must have stopped him in mid stream After that although all cassettes were present I didn't receive that final speech and the key was not always available on the floor and sometimes I couldn't finish the game without returning to a previous 'Save' SO I repeat SAVEjust beforeinserting that last cassette

Colored balls puzzles Look close at the colored balls puzzle
Note the colors of the arrows at each end of the balls
Arrange the balls according to the colors of the arrows
Top is red right is green bottom is white and left is yellow
I did this by arranging the inner colors first going outwards
There's an empty slot at the outer layer that you can place ball on to make space for ball addition on that set of balls
The layers can be turned clockwise or counterclockwise by left or right click of the mouse on the layers
The balls can be moved to an open space by clicking on it
It is touchy so be sure that the cursor is on the ball and not on the layer
Good luck

Solution by drdel At the start of the puzzle Save your game before you touch it
In the close up you rsquo ll see the balls arranged in four radial arms at clock positions and o rsquo clock
If you look at the little arrows at each clock position you rsquo ll see which colors are to finally go on the arms o rsquo clock red o rsquo clock green o rsquo clock white and o rsquo clock yellow
When you start the balls are arranged from inside out on each arm as white green red and yellow
Obviously you rsquo re going to have to do some jiggling to move the balls around so that there is one of each color in each ring in the correct aspect to each other
Keep the relationship of the colors to each other in mind as you go and think Rubik rsquo s cube
That rsquo s what gave me a clue to finally solving this wretched little monster
You rsquo ll see there are four rings plus an outer ring with a lsquo free rsquo spot that you can temporarily park a ball on
I labeled mine from center outward as R R R R and OR for outer ring
All the rings move either clockwise or counter clockwise with L or R mouse clicks
Clicking on a ball will move it to an empty space
Clicking on the empty space just moves that ring so position your mouse carefully when you rsquo re clicking
Here goes R mouse click your OR to the position
Click on each ball and move each one outward
That leaves a slot on the R to move something into
R mouse click R
At o rsquo clock position move all the balls towards the center R mouse click OR to position
Insert yellow ball into the R
R mouse click OR to position
Move all balls outward
R mouse click R
At position move red ball to center
R mouse click R
At position move all the rest of the balls toward the center
R mouse click OR to position
Move all balls outward
R mouse click R
At position move yellow ball toward center
L mouse click R
At position move red ball toward center
Move yellow ball down to R L mouse click OR
Move yellow ball in to R
R mouse click OR
At position move all balls outward
R mouse click R
Move one yellow ball in
R mouse click R
Move remaining yellow and the green balls in
R mouse click OR to position
Move all balls outward
L mouse click R
At position move the white ball in toward center
R mouse click R
R mouse click R
At position move the green ball toward center
L mouse click R
Move all white balls in toward center
L mouse click OR to position
Move green ball onto OR
Also move R yellow ball to R
R mouse click R
Move R yellow ball to R then L click R
You should now have all yellow and white balls in their proper positions
Now to fix red and green
R mouse click R
At position move R red ball to R
L mouse click R
At position move R green ball right to R
L mouse click R
At position move R green ball to R
R mouse click R
R mouse click R
At position move R red ball down to R
L mouse click R R mouse click OR x and pop green ball onto it rsquo s proper arm

In the close up you rsquo ll see the balls arranged in four radial arms at clock positions and o rsquo clock
If you look at the little arrows at each clock position you rsquo ll see which colors are to finally go on the arms o rsquo clock red o rsquo clock green o rsquo clock white and o rsquo clock yellow
When you start the balls are arranged from inside out on each arm as white green red and yellow
Obviously you rsquo re going to have to do some jiggling to move the balls around so that there is one of each color in each ring in the correct aspect to each other Keep the relationship of the colors to each other in mind as you go and think Rubik rsquo s cube
That rsquo s what gave me a clue to finally solving this wretched little monster You rsquo ll see there are four rings plus an outer ring with a lsquo free rsquo spot that you can temporarily park a ball on
I labeled mine from center outward as R R R R and OR for outer ring
All the rings move either clockwise or counter clockwise with L or R mouse clicks
Clicking on a ball will move it to an empty space
Clicking on the empty space just moves that ring so position your mouse carefully when you rsquo re clicking
Here goes R click your OR to the position
Click on each ball and move each one out ward
That leaves a slot on the R to move something into
R click R
At o rsquo clock position move all the balls towards the center R click OR to position
Insert yellow ball into the R
R click OR to position
Move all balls outward
R click R
At position move red ball to center
R click R
At position move all the rest of the balls toward the center
R click OR to position
Move all balls outward
R click R
At position move yellow ball toward center
L click R
At position move red ball toward center
Move yellow ball down to R L click OR
Move yellow ball in to R

At position move all balls outward
R click R
Move one yellow ball in
R click R
Move remaining yellow and the green balls in
R click OR to position
Move all balls outward
L click R
At position move the white ball in toward center
R click R
R click R
At position move the green ball toward center
L click R
Move all white balls in toward center
L click OR to position
Move green ball onto OR
Also move R yellow ball to R
R click R
Move R yellow ball to R then L click R
You should now have all yellow and white balls in their proper positions
Now to fix red and green

L click R
At position move R green ball to R

NIGHTLONG Union City Conspiracy Commentary and Walkthrough By Soren Andersen Commentary Nightlong is a game that is styled on the classic private eye movies protagonist Joshua Reev even sounds like Bogart
It is a typical adventure game in that it is inventory driven and you have to carefully move the cursor over the screen to find all the items and hotspots that are used to progress through the action
It is also one of the most linear games that you are likely to encounter
As usual many of the things that Joshua must do defy logic at least until after they are done but that is what makes adventure games
Sometimes it comes down to trying to use just about every item in inventory with every hotspot in the screen and that includes other inventory items as well and before long there are a lot of these
Some disappear when no longer needed some do not and you may pick up two or three that are never used
There are a great many red herrings hotspots that have no effect on the game and several blind alleys but again that is part of the game
The sound effects in Nightlong are very good and the graphics throughout are excellent a particular example being the cyberspace church maze as well as the way in which Joshua moves about
The game has some very good operational features not the least of which are adjustable volume and a closed caption option and right click jump action when a go to appears on the screen
There are deficiencies however and the primary one is the limited number of save game allocations
The astute Adventure gamer saves many times but Nightlong allows you only opportunities and the thumbnail views are too small
You can however record over a previously saved game at the expense of that game
Another annoyance is that every time the game is launched it must be done from disc this is rather unprofessional as well as aggra vating
There are several long conversations in which important plot infor mation is revealed and many games have a provision in which these become available should you wish to recall them for reference but unfortunately such a convenience is not provided in Nightlong
As an observation it may be noted that the names of the people listed at the beginning of the credits for this game appear to be Italian and a reasonable inference is that it originated in that country
This matter is brought up only because you will note that the lip movements are not well synchronized in most cases not at all with the spoken and written dialogue so the characters are in all likelihood speaking Italian
Admittedly not a large matter what you hear and read is what is important
In addition some of the terminology encountered to describe items is strange to American eyes and ears
It may take you a little time not much to become accustomed to the game interfacing
Keep in mind as you guide Joshua through this game that generally speaking you left click the mouse on a hotspot object to observe it Joshua will usually make a comment you get a lot of action indications from him and you right click to use it either acquire it or do something with it and frequently it will be to your advantage to click both buttons on the same item first the left and then the right
Left clicking through the inventory may provide descriptions that are different than left clicking on the item before being acquired
To use an inventory item you right click on it whereupon it starts revolving then search with your cursor for the spot where you which use it keeping your eye on the somewhat hard to see blue legend for this location to be stated
The walkthrough that follows this commentary will present very detailed steps initially and will assume that you soon become familiar enough with techniques so that after a short time playing less detail will suffice
Also please note that though you are acting as Joshua sometimes the given directions are to have him do something other times the statement is to have you do it or no subject at all
Should you want minimal direction without the detail of the walkthrough an appended document called a stepthrough is included
This will only guide you from place to place and save a lot of wandering around though of course looking for the correct location for the next action is integral to the Adventure game experience
The guidance provided by the stepthrough is limited what you find and do at each site is up to you and how skillful you are
Within the limits Save Often
Walkthrough There is a minute introductory video in which private detective Joshua Reev and Union City rsquo s Governor Hugh Martens are introduced to you and the initial game premise is set
Reading the game booklet that is in the CD jewel case also will have made you familiar with this
The year is and Martens is the object of attacks by a secret terrorist organization
His undercover agent Simon Ruby who has infiltrated this group is missing and Joshua is to investigate the situation
As a starting point he is left on the rooftop entrance to Ruby rsquo s apartment building
The initial inventory contains the items given to Joshua by Hugh Martens during the introduction a minicom to communicate with Martens credit notes money Ruby rsquo s elevator code card a magnetic pen and a small key
Apartment Building Subway Rotmall Subway Zoo Warning
Technical malfunction in the command code
Replace damaged file
Control room access code follows
Use graphic wheels according to standard procedure
Today rsquo s code Under the supreme eye of the father of the gods Sits the solar protector of all men To the right of he who delights in the eternal coming of his being
Subway Zoo Hideout Cyberspace Churchyard and Maze I a a skeleton from which you get a blanket called cloth in inventory b a werewolf c a baptismal font from which you get a half credit silver coin d sculpture flowing lava Castle Marten's Cyberoffice Churchyard and Maze Marten's Cyberoffice Rocas Perdida Notes You have to suspend a lot of common sense when playing Nightlong but this usually the case when it comes to adventure games
For instance the inventory no matter what Joshua picks up all goes into the front of his jacket whether it is an open can of grease or a handful of charcoal
After engaging enough of these games one accepts such a situation with scarcely a second thought
There are other situations or contradictions that defy natural laws or common practice most are trivial but some make it difficult to know what to do without a hint
There are more of these and all such must be expected and accepted when playing a computer game
Flags Laboratory Blackboard Code The symbols on the blackboard cannot be reproduced by any normally available computer font so letters will be substituted by assigning one to each new ABC x DE DEFC DEFC CBFC AGECB symbol encountered
Also the multiplication and addition operations will be treated separately
Thus the symbol to letter transformed blackboard mathematics is compare these to the blackboard
Note that in the followingcolumn numbering is from right to left
Consider first the addition
No matter how big the numbers DEFC and CBFC are the value for A cannot be greater than and since it exists no leading zeros that must be the value for A
In the multiplication all three numbers end in C the same digit
For this to be true C has to be or
Check it out
In the addition with C either or there will be a carry of into the ndcolumn the latter containing the same digit F for both numbers in this column
Any number added to itself as in the ndcolumn must result in an even number but with the carry of from column the sum of column must be odd
Since the sum is C this eliminates for the value and C
With this value for C the stcolumn is therefore the value for B must be and with the carry of the only way the sum of the ndcolumn could be is if F
So far we have A B C and F
Thus x D DE DE GE The values and are eliminated for the remaining digits D E and G Now using and for D in the multiplication x x x x x x Since the last digits of the product must be the values and are eliminated and D must be or
The rdcolumn of the addition cannot produce a carry and the thcolumn must do so so is eliminated leaving or for D If D the sum of the thcolumn is and G would be but that digit is already assigned to A and therefore cannot be used for D and thus D
Furthermore with D being the thcolumn is and so G leaving or for E Having established that D the product x applies and focusing on the rddigit of the product comparing with the original symbolic expression shows that E

A Walkthrough byMalcolm Schmidt GAME BOOMER'S Hints Cheats and Walkthroughs
This is such a marvelously enjoyable game
D cartoon like graphics and a hauntingly beautiful musical score as only Disney can do
While it is an quot action quot game of sorts quot Ned quot cannot die
If he loses any of his encounters he will just move on to the next one
This is aKeyboardadventure you may also play with aJoystick or Gamepad but I promise it is not difficult if you have the opportunity to play this adorable children's game don't miss out on it
The music is worth it alone would you care to hear some
Introduction music to Nightmare Ned As we begin this adventure we find our young hero quot Ned quot arriving home from school
As he walks into the kitchen he finds a note from his mother and realizes that he is all alone in the house it is a little after pm
The note on the 'fridge quot tells him that quot Mom quot will be home about pm Not very long to wait is it or is it
Happy that he has the run of the house shades of an early quot Tom Cruise quot here I think Ned decides to raid the refrigerator completely ignoring thesecond notethat his mother left inside the refrigerator for him
He moves into the den and plants himself on the sofa with all the goodies from the kitchen to keep him company
He starts to play his favorite video game
As night falls a terrible thunderstorm begins to rage outside See where I'm going with this one
All at once the lights go out and poor lonely afraid of the dark Ned realizes the severity of his situation
The phone begins to ring
Scared but probably thinking that it's his mother he makes a run through the hall for the phone but no one is there
As he turns around he sees a horrible shadow on the walls thinking that it's a monster he tries desperately to get away but gets tangled in the phone cord instead
Poor little Ned trips and falls all the while convinced that very soon he will be taking his last breath
Fortunately he realizes just what had happened to him
That was nomonsterof whom he was so terrified
It was nothing more then ashadow of his tree outside in the yard
The hallway window was just reflecting it onto the wall
Laughing at his own foolishness he relaxes a bit but it's only momentary
The fear he has is once again renewed deep within him and he decides quickly to go to bed here's where the fun oops
I meant the quot terror quot really begins
He falls asleep and so begins his nightmare world
It all starts from his quot Quilt quot
This supposedly comforting
cover becomes the entry way intoNed's Nightmares There are of them and you can play them in any order
All you have to do is have Ned walk up to one of them hit theshift keyafter you meet theShadowand jump in Graveyard Nightmare Alcatraz Academy Nightmare Bathroom Nightmare Medical Nightmare The Attic Basement amp Beyond Nightmare Keep in mind that while this isn't a quot timed quot game Ned will quot wake up quot in hours
Or tries
Every time you return to the quot Quilt quot you will lose one hour or quot turn quot
But that's ok because each one of the nightmare world has secret passages one to each of the other worlds so it is possible not to have to return to the Quilt until the very end of the game
You can also quot lose quot hours if you get clobbered too many times
So be careful So let us begin You play the part of quot Ned Needleman quot a little eight year old boy whose afraid of his own shadow along with everybody else's
After the opening scene go forward on theQuilt at the Head of the bed There's a patch with a circular corkscrew like symbol on it
As you approach a shadow appears telling you that He's just dying for you to visit him Press the shift key to enter As soon as you are pulled from the grave by the grave digger walk towards the right Use the Yo Yo spacebar on the man with the cat in the bag before the cat take's bite out of you
And don't forget to duck down directional key because they seem to have an awful lot of spiders here
Continue going right right directional key until you come upon an open grave
Jump in shift key
After you land try to figure a way out
What happens if you try to take out that lamp with your Yo Yo spacebar
Notice anything
Maybe you could use that poufy chair ottoman to get out of the grave
Maybe by jumping on it
But you've gotta get rid of that skeleton's legs first
Otherwise he'll justclose the book on you Make sure that you time it so that as soon as the lamp is out scurry on over to the very front of the ottomanand thenjump uponto the ottoman
Whoooohooo
Have a nice trip
Continuewalking to the rightand use your Yo Yo on the scary ghost who try to get in your way
Especially the one with the sickle
Pretty soon you'll come to a tree
A purple tree Oh well it's a nightmare isn't then Climb up the steps on the tree
Get rid of the Green Ghosts with your trusty Yo Yo
There will be two left when you're done
Now get that monster at the very top of the tree Can't
OK here's the trick wait until he raises his arm then whack 'em in the heart with the Yo Yo
Do it Four times and he's toast Then climb down the tree and hop past the quot Pumpkins on a Stick quot or you'll get dosed with Pumpkin vomit Ugh Still moving rightyou'll come acrossa large purple urn alota purple in this part
Move to the front of it To get in jump up twice and in you fall Oh now this is just lovely
Well don't just stand there Use the Yo Yo
nifty weapon isn't it
Use iton thetreeon the right and then that eyed kidon the box on the left Watch out for that fire breathing pig though
Wait until it flies away thenjump uponto theJack in the Boxand away you go Note By now you should see thatCreepy Shadow The onethat first invited you to join him back there on theQuilt Only he looks different doesn't he
Still a shadow yes but now he is partly colored
Maybe you should continue through this nightmare and see if we can't change him totally If you continuewalking to the right You'll meet up with some dearly departed girl scouts having there annual marshmallow roast
Get out the Yo Yohere and blast them both
But be very careful not to fall into the opened grave or you too will be toast
How about some cookies Oh no
You've become a monster Let's go say quot hello quot to the other fellow of our kind Whoops
Have a nice trip see ya next fall Looks like you've found your self in a mausoleum
If youuse the Yo Yo on the little girl she'll ask you to get the nightlight back from the bat bats like shiny bright objects you know But how to get up there

Yep there is Use your Yo Yoto close the box shut thenjump upon top of it Jump up againand you'll land on the crypt with the face carved into it you'll land on top of the carving jump up againto reach the lid Jump over ctrlkey to the other crypt

Justjump under the basket ball when the time is right
Go towards the cell on the other side and Yo Yo it to open the cell door
Go inside After a long walk down the hallway to the boys room you're caught by the principle and hauled off to his office Yo Yo the yellow button on the left and then cross right to the red button with the phone and Yo Yo it
But this doesn't always work What your trying to do here is get the principle to call your parents
They both come to your aid and tell the principle that you couldn't possibly be the culprit
You find yourself back in the hallway with the tall basketball player Move to the left until you see who the School shadow really is Why it's Billy
The kid that's always calling you quot Melon head quot
Your Done here
Your choice is either theQuilt press Q or one of thesecret passage ways
If you start from theQuilt The Shadow appears and lets you know in no uncertain terms that he wants to quot flush quot you into his nightmare
Down the pipes you go and get swallowed by a toilet charming Move to the right and jump from one tub to another
Jump when the tub dips toward you
Use the ctrl and right arrow key to progress Proceeduntil you getto the second ladder Climb upand listen to the quot Growing Up Song quot
You will automatically climb down the ladder back to the tubs Continue on through the tubs to the right past the outhouse The door of the outhouse is thesecret passagewayto the Attic Basement and Beyond Nightmare Move passed it and on into the next room with two windows There's a large open pipe here Move to the exact middle of it then press the shift key twice to enter into it After a short swim through the sewers you'll find yourself in a room full of quot potties quot of all different shapes and sizes
The idea here is tojump over all the toilets without falling in
Use a combination of the quot Ctrl quot key and quot Left arrow quot key to jump over the them Keep in mind if you do fall in you'll be chased by a snake a plumbers snake that is and wind up in a tiny room
To the right is asecret passagewayto the Medical Nightmare
To the left is the tub room Urgh
those tubs To get around the tubsso that you don't have to go through that nightmare again justgo to your left to the second room Hey
There 's that pipe again
once You are threw with the toilets it's on to the razors JeezeLouise It is tricky to get by these buzzers without getting a close shave Sodouble back to Between the th and th toilets the last two jump on the handle then on the top of the th toilet then on top of the th toilet move to the right and hit the dangling rope with your mighty Yo Yo Ah
the razors are asleep
Jump on to the th toilet and them jump again onto the floor
Jump past thus razors and onto the next large open pipe
Jump into it Nice
Your in that little room again Go to the left back up to the tub room I guess your back where you started but this time walk to your left under the ceiling fans and Yo Yo those mice
Keep doing it until they form a ladder for you Make sure that youshut off the fan before you start to climb up the mice ladder You'll have to kill of them to make the ladder Jump into one of the toilets at the top of the ladder Ned will become target practice inside a bathtub
He will get himself free and end up in front of the outhouse to the right of the moving bathtubs
And we'll get to say hello to his toilet Yeesh
I've always been afraid of hospitals Now
you'll hear quot Dentist Waiting Room Music quot Walk to the center of the screen
Jump into the first chair Hospital by pressing either the spacebar or the shift key This contraption turns into a gurney and we're off to the races
As you race down the corridor you'll notice that the Doctors that are peeking out from behind these door are various heights By using the up or down arrows you can raise or lower the gurney
This is important because if the gurney is in the high position then the short Doctors can't take your organs
And it follows that if the gurney is in the low position then the tall doctors can't get you either Good luck on this one folks
The best I managed was to lose organs At the end of this mad dash the Organ Replacement Room awaits
So now you have a chance to get back your missing organs
Be successful in this and you'll proceed to the next level and a secret passageway
Fail and you get to start this whole medical procedure all over again
Rats Hint In the Organ Replacement Room press the space bar while you are spinning around when the arrow points to a jar just after the one with the organ in it
The trick is to do it in a clockwise fashion When all the organs are replaced you'll be freed from the operating table and you'll drop down to the floor
If youwalk to the rightyou'll see thesecret passagewayto the Bathroom Nightmare
If youwalk to the left you'll reenter the Medical Nightmare Do this and this time choose the Dentist Chair I like the going to the dentist even worse then the doctor Well now you're in somebody's mouth Walk to the right along the teeth Use the Yo Yo to fight the green plaque monsters on the teeth When you get to the rubber bands jump on them to help you to jump up and hang on to the braces above you
Then use the right or left arrow to move Be careful not to get attacked by that crazy dentist too often or you'll lose hours
There aretwo places to climbinto the upper part of the mouth the tooth with red decay to the right of the first rubber band and the third rubber band
Stay on the RED TOOTH until the mouth closes
Then use the up arrow key to climb the ladder Say quot hello quot to your Fairy Godmother Gingivitis
You will automatically climb down to the teeth when this part is done at the third rubber band Yo Yo the two decaying teeth resting on this rubber band then walk to the middle of the rubber band to where a gap in the upper teeth is
Press the quot Shift quot key and you'll jump up through the gap Meet the King of the Mouth quot The Uvula quot
After Uvula's song you return back onto the rubber band Continue on fighting your way through the plaqueand if your lucky you'll get to see Dr Klutzchnik Ned's own Dentist
If you've done everything your supposed to do you'll be returned to the Black Medical Room again where you can either choose one of the chairs one more time or exit through one of thesecret passageways Note This one was the hardest one for me
You'll start out in the cat room Get rid of the cat on the far right ladder
Then the cat on the left hand side Between these two ladders is a very weak board
Fall through the board and come face to face with Madame Leota
Well I don't know if this is her real name but she sure looks like a Madame Leoata
Walk over to her and she'll begin to read the stars and planets for you But she needs your help You've go to catch one of those objects flying around the room
Go for the chair
Stand to the right of the table and try towhack it with your Yo Yo
When you've go it right the chair will stand on top of the table Use the ctrl key to jump up onto those gray planet models on the floor in front of the table and then onto the chair
Next try to Yo Yo the table
Once you get thatuse the shift button to jump up onto the table
Now go for the gold The Vacuum cleaner
Have a whack that that one
Now all you have to do is climb the ladder
Just don't forget to hop over that red white and blue area rug or you'll fall in again Walk to the left and Yo Yo the phonograph
A trap door will open If you walk into it you can either go toThe Bathroom Nightmarejust follow the screen to the left or return to the attic through the box on the right Back up in the atticwalk over to the moving carton and Yo Yo it
Continue on left and Yo Yo that bird cage
Try the lamp next and then enter behind the screens
There are three different silhouettes to be seen here by crossing behind the screens Walk over to the bookcase
Yo Yo the bookcase and it will start to spin
Go through the spinning door and then down the stairs If you go to your left you'll get a super wedgie Walk down the staircase until you meet the Dragon head on the wall Yo Yo the dragon head to hear some interesting poetry Climb back up the stairs and go left towards the quot Wedgie Wall quot
There's some strange stuff up here YO YO those weird stuffed animalsbut don't lose your head
Thenwalk over to the ladder box and give it a Yo Yo as well Well
lookie there a green ladder Go ahead andclimb up If you go to the right that's the entrance to theMedical Nightmare Walk to the left towards the glowing eyes
Just follow along to your left until you see the sizzling steak
Hit it with you trusty Yo Yo Now these doggies have dinner
Look they're so grateful that they made you a ladder Climb itbefore something else happens
Well what do we have here
Whack those two with your Yo Yo before they blow us all up
Wellat least until they throw away their golden key
Keep moving to the right
Lunch anyone Can youwhack that pepper shaker
Well what do you know
Yet another form of Ladder
This one made out of bones Climb up Oh come on don't be such a slug Oops Gee I guess you really are a slug
I'm sorry I'll try to be more patient
Continue up the tree until you fall off Be careful though that crazy lady is shaking salt all over the place Slugs don't like salt do they
Oh well
Hurry as best you can towards the little slug hole on the right
After you go through that hole you should be feeling like more of yourself
Climb up the ladder and jump onto the spring which will take you up to the top of a tree And just think you get to meet Sally
and her doll
Ending the game is actually a little harder than you might think
Remember that you only have saves And you'll lose one each time you utilize the quot Quilt quot or quot Q quot key
Try to keep at least saves free
And near the end of your game go back to the quot Quilt quot and take a look at each of the Shadows and their entry ways
If they are completed they will no longer be Shadows
If they are not and still have some quot Shadow quot left on them then you'll need to go back to the corresponding Nightmare to finish some more tasks
Once it's all done You'll wake up into your parents arms But the shadows will still have their say

By Becky Waxman Preparations ThisNikopol Secrets of the Immortalswalkthrough was updated on to reflect the changes in the version released by Big Fish Games
Nikopol Secrets of the Immortalsis a point and click adventure game that uses first person perspective and degree panning
As you move the cursor it changes as it glides over hotspots that show when you can move take things use things and examine things
The main menu is a futuristic landscape from atop Nikopol rsquo s apartment building in Paris
You can pan around degrees to see all the menu features
Here you first select a profile multiple profiles allow more than one person to play the game at the same time save load quit start a new game continue gameplay watch the credits and tweak the options mouse sensitivity volume subtitles click on the empty bar to enable the subtitles screen resolution and graphic quality
There are nine save slots plus an autosave
Under certain circumstances saving over a previous save changes the saved game rsquo s position on the list ndash you should keep track of the saves by date and the accompanying screenshot not by the position on the saved game list
You can reach the main menu during gameplay by pressing the ldquo Esc rdquo key twice
The main menu can be confusing to navigate as can some close up screens later in the game
quot Active hotspot quot buttons in close up screens tend to be on the lower right of the screen and can be very small
Look for small words or symbols the small white word quot save quot under the rectangle in the Save Menu for instance or a small quot X quot or quot quot symbol when trying to get out of computer screens or other close up screens later in the game
Sometimes clicking once on an object brings a comment and you will need to click again to get the response described in this walkthrough
Nikopolis alt tab friendly so that you can access your desktop at any time while playing the game
Right click to bring up the inventory
To then select an inventory item left click on one of the displayed items to place it in the ldquo active rdquo position at the bottom of the screen
Once an item is in the ldquo active rdquo position you use it by left clicking on the point in the environment where you want to place or use the item
The inventory screen also contains two small bluish buttons
These are located between the center circle and the outer circle that displays the various items
When you click on the lower right bluish button the cursor will turn into a magnifying glass
Clicking the magnifying glass on any documents in the outer inventory circle enables you to read them
Right clicking allows you to exit the inventory
In the Got Game version of this game you can access the Nikopol User Manual in pdf format once the game is installed by going to Start Programs Nikopol
Note I played the PC version ofNikopol published by Got Game in North America ndash the version published in Europe by Lighthouse Interactive may contain slight differences
For the version of Nikopol released byBig Fish Games note the differences in gameplay signified by the blue font
Before we get started note that the Big Fish version has fixed a translation error in which the word quot crane quot should have been quot skull quot In a couple of instances hotspots that were accessible too early in the Got Game version have been deactivated until later in the Big Fish version if this guide says to click on something and it doesn't work yet try moving ahead to the next instruction in the guide
Setting the Scene The game opens with a cut scene introducing the player to Alcide Nikopol the artist and the remarkable events that are unfolding around him
During the sequence a strange being looks at the unconscious body of a man and remarks ldquo This mortal seems pure ndash surely lost in this city rdquo Toward the end of the sequence you rsquo ll see Nikopol as he paints plus a brief view of his signature at the bottom of a canvas
You then find yourself in a crumbling apartment that appears to be in an advanced state of disarray ndash giving new meaning to the ldquo eccentric artist starving in a garret rdquo experience
Although there are female figures in Nikopol rsquo s paintings it rsquo s doubtful that a female has had a hand in either embellishing or straightening up his apartment
The year is the location ndash Paris
Depressing manifestations of ruin and despair have overtaken what was once The City of Light
The dictator prophet Choublanc now holds sway heading up the state controlled church and the military
One section of Paris the city center exists for the favored few who run the government
Everyone else lives amidst poverty and squalor
Current Events Four events now color the future of Nikopol and his fellow Parisians
First an enormous jelly fish like creature has appeared atop the Montparnasse Tower the tallest building in Paris also sometimes called the bunker and the creature is rapidly growing in size
Second a mysterious capsule has crashed in a part of the city and whatever was inside has escaped before the military could reach it
Third a floating pyramid has appeared from nowhere apparently inhabited by beings resembling gods from ancient Egypt
And last there rsquo s an upcoming election in which the dictator prophet Choublanc is the only candidate with punishment guaranteed for anyone who doesn rsquo t turn up to vote for him
Artist in Residence After the opening cut scene you can explore Nikopol rsquo s apartment pick up items and hear him comment on his surroundings
Left click whenever you see the cursor change
Nikopol mentions that he once painted a portrait of Choublanc
A painting to the right of Nikopol rsquo s empty easel reveals a woman with blue fingernails and an odd mesh like sleeve over her right arm
On the bottom right of the painting is Nikopol rsquo s signature from the opening cut scene
Items that should be picked up in the first two rooms the bedroom and studio include Leave the bedroom by clicking to open the double doors
Nikopol rsquo s living room is in even worse shape than his bedroom and studio
Look up at the ceiling and down at the floor to see exposed pipes and wiring water leaking on the floor and metal braces that have been clumsily wedged to keep the ceiling from tumbling down
Click on the movie projector in the center of the room then click on the top round reel canister to open it
Move toward the fireplace at the end of the living room and click to note the blocked double doors to the right of the fireplace
On the right of the fireplace mantle next to some piping is avideo reelthat you can pick up
Note if you rsquo ve already found the hotspot that lowers the movie screen over the top portion of the fireplace you won rsquo t be able to pick up this video reel until you rsquo ve clicked on the center bottom of the movie screen to send the screen back up to the ceiling
Read All About It Turn back around to the coffee table with papers on it
Click on all of the papers and read them
Walk through the gap in the living room wall to the entryway
Look at the ceiling where Nikopol is worried that there may be a collapse
Pick up the paper under the door
It rsquo saletterfrom someone named Gorgon
Nikopol has recently joined an anti government religious sect and Gorgon the organization rsquo s Chaplain invites him to appear at the cemetery for the final test and rite of initiation
Gorgon asks Nikopol to bring a picture of Nikopol rsquo s father to the test
This last requirement is puzzling but Nikopol decides to obey the request
The only problem ndash he doesn rsquo t have a picture of his father to bring
Walk into what rsquo s left of the bathroom ndash not much privacy here
Click on the phone to hear a message about the upcoming election
Setting Up the Movie Projector Return to the movie projector in the living room If you haven rsquo t already click to open up the circular video reel canister
Right click to bring up the inventory
In inventory place the cursor over thevideo reeluntil you see the words ldquo video reel rdquo appear and left click on it
You will automatically return to Nikopol rsquo s living room and thevideo reelwill be in the ldquo active rdquo position at the bottom left of the screen
Move the cursor until it rsquo s over the open video real canister on the movie projector and left click on the open canister to place thevideo reelin it
Then click on it to close the canister
The movie projector is now ready to be used
Before you can use the projector you need something on which to project the image
Go to the fireplace and look up at the conjunction of the ceiling and fireplace
Click to bring down the movie screen
Click on the switch on the movie projector to see a film of Nikopol rsquo s father who was also named Alcide Nikopol at his court martial for insubordination
Alcide Nikopol Senior was condemned to forced hibernation in a space capsule a sentence that was supervised by an android called XB
Nikopol rsquo s father could easily be his twin the two are eerily alike
It seems from the similarities in their physical appearance that Nikopol could simply do a self portrait to give to Gorgon
However this task won rsquo t be that easy
Setting Up the Easel Go back into the studio
In the corner near the bust are some canvases
Pick upawhitecanvas
Turn around and pick upthe emptyeaselnext to the picture of the woman with blue fingernails
Return to the living room

Right click to return to the inventory and left click onthe painting tubes brush which will appear in the lower left of the screen in the ldquo active rdquo position
Left click on thecanvas and Nikopol mentions that he needs to find a ldquo trick rdquo to paint more quickly
Right click to return thepainting tubes brushto the inventory
Then turn and click on the knob on the movie projector that rsquo s about midway up the base of the projector
This turns the projector toward thewhite canvas
Nikopol can now use the projected image to paint a picture of his father
Portrait of the Revolutionary as a Young Man Right click to go back into the inventory and left click on thepainting tubes brushto put them into the ldquo active rdquo position
Left click on thewhite canvasto bring up a close up of thewhitecanvasand to begin painting
There are five available colors ndash black dark grey light grey off white and white
The colors cannot be mixed
The task is to paint the colors in the correct place on the canvas
Now is a good time to experiment with the painting and black is the easiest color with which to experiment
Click on the black paint and then on the hair of the figure on the canvas
Note that this paints the hair the eyebrows and the eyes
Click on the white paint and click on the hair to erase the black paint
Click on the black paint and click on the middle of the figure rsquo s forehead
Note that this paints the middle of the forehead the top portions of the shirt part of the cheeks and nose and eyes
Click on the white paint and click on the forehead to erase the black paint
Click on the black paint and click on the middle of the figure rsquo s chin
Note that this paints the chin and portions of the ear the lower parts of the cheeks and the forehead directly under the hair
Click on the white paint and click on the middle of the chin to erase the black paint
Click on the black paint and click on the figure rsquo s neck under the chin and somewhat to the left
Note that this paints the shadowed portion of the face ndash the left portion of the neck around the exterior of the eyebrows and eyes the left nostril portions of the ear and a very fine line beneath the hair
Click on the white paint and click on the neck to erase the black paint
Click on the black paint and click on the left portion of the shirt
Note that this paints the shirt one cheek and the bridge of the nose
Click on the white paint and click on the left portion of the shirt to erase the black paint
Finishing the Portrait of Nikopol rsquo s Father You have just painted the shirt white which is the color that it ought to be
Now you are ready to add the right color to the other portions of the painting
Click on the black paint and click on the hair
Click on thedarkgrey paint and click on the neck
Click on thelightgrey paint and click on the chin
Click on the off white paint and click on the forehead
Since you painted the shirt white already there should be a slight pause and then the close up view of the canvas and paints will disappear and the finishedportrait of Nikopol rsquo s fatherwill go into the inventory
Now would probably be a good time to save your game
Getting out of the Apartment for a Bit of Air You now should have in inventory Gorgon rsquo s letter incense portrait of Nikopol thechisel the hammer andthe chains
Go to the entryway facing the door out of the apartment
Before clicking on the door look back toward the bathroom and note a tall grey metal pipe that is leaning in the left corner next to what would have been the door to the bathroom area
A timed challenge follows
Click on the door to exit
As soon as Nikopol goes out into the hall he sees a giant insect like creature coming up the stairs toward him
He automatically goes back into the apartment a sensible course of action considering
Slowing Down the Creature Monster As soon as you have control of the cursor turn around and pick up the grey metal pipe in the corner
You can use it without having to put it into your inventory
The cursor becomes the pipe after you pick it up ndash turn back around and click it on the door and the door is temporarily blocked
As quickly as you can go through the bathroom and turn to head toward the bedroom
If you aren rsquo t quick enough the giant insect like creature bursts through the front door and you die as everything fades to red
It rsquo s fun the first couple of times this happens
You can start the sequence again by clicking on the pyramid that appears on the screen after the fades to red graphic dissolves
As you click to go into the bedroom you rsquo ll probably see the insect like creature burst through the front door though there is no fade to red this time
If you have clicked to enter the bedroom quickly enough you rsquo ll enter and automatically close the bedroom double doors behind you
As soon as you have control of the cursor right click to bring up the inventory and left click on thechainto put it into the ldquo active rdquo position on the lower left of the screen
Then click on the door
This chains the door shut and gives you an unlimited amount of time with which to work
End of the timed challenge
Fragrant Incense Go into the studio and note that the creature can rsquo t see you but only smell you
How can you eliminate its sense of smell
Return to the bedroom and pick up the small redlighterthat sits atop a piece of papernext to the bed
Right click to bring up the inventory and left click on theincense which will appear in the ldquo active rdquo position on the lower left part of the screen
Move the cursor to look for a hotspot over the long narrow brown incense holder just above the piece of paper where you picked up the lighter
Click on this hotspot to put the incense into the holder
Right click to bring up the inventory and left click on thelighterto put it into the ldquo active rdquo position on the lower left part of the screen
Then click on theincenseand Nikopol will light it
This will make it impossible for the insect like creature to smell where you are
Trapping the Creature Monster Return to the studio
The old wooden cabinet with the rock on it is blocking a way out into the living room
If you move it you could provide another exit into the living room and possibly trap the insect like creature in the bedroom
There rsquo s a large metal hoist on the side of the room to the right of the bust
Click on the hoist with a pincer arm to move it next to the old wooden cabinet
Click on the hanging control panel on the right to lower the pincer arm to pick up the rock on the old wooden cabinet
Click on the control panel again to lift the rock
Click on the metal hoist to move it away from the old wooden cabinet
Now would probably be a good time to save your game
Walk back into the bedroom
A timed challenge follows
Click to remove thechainfrom the bedroom door
It will take a few seconds for the creature to break down the door
As soon as you have control of the cursor again turn and click to return to the studio
Click on the old wooden cabinet to move it to block the door leading into the bedroom
Turn and click on the metal hoist with the rock to place it in front of the newly relocated wooden cabinet
Then click on the hanging control panel on the right of the metal hoist to put the rock on the old wooden cabinet to secure it
You can now enter the living room through the door that used to be blocked by the old wooden cabinet
If you can still see the creature through the opening in the wall wait until it goes back into the bedroom
Once out of the studio don rsquo t immediately run toward the front door to exit the apartment
Instead you want to trap the creature in the bedroom
Click to move into the living room and turn left and click to go toward the bedroom
Click on the double doors to the bedroom to shut them
Then right click to bring up the inventory and left click on thechainin inventory to put it into the ldquo active rdquo position
Left click on the door to chain it shut
The creature can no longer escape
Note if you aren rsquo t quick enough you rsquo ll be given the chance to try again when the screen with the pyramid appears
End of the timed challenge
Unblocking the Front Door When you try to leave the apartment through the front door you realize that the exit is blocked by debris
It rsquo s a good thing you trapped the creature in the bedroom because if you hadn rsquo t it would have caught up with you as you tried to remove the debris
Move the cursor around the entryway area ndash the debris has created new items to pick up and to move
Click on the door to discover that Nikopol needs a tool to un jam the door
If the metal support is moved the ceiling will collapse
Click to remove the debris near the door
Click to prick up a grey cement brick to the left of the door this does not go into inventory but the cursor becomes the cement brick
Place the cement brick where the debris was just removed
Click to pick up a plank to the right of the door and place it on top of the cement brick
The metal support falls but the makeshift cement brick plank device holds up the ceiling
In inventory click on thehammerto place it in the ldquo active rdquo position on the lower left of the screen
Click on the door to clear a path out of the apartment
The stairway out of the building is now blocked
The insect like creature certainly leaves a mess in its wake
Turn to the left thehammeris still in the ldquo active rdquo position and click to see a close up of the bricked up window
You must use the hammer to break the bricks in order to escape
Note if you exit the close up view of the window you will probably need to click on thehammerin inventory again in order to use it on the bricked up window
You are allotted five strokes represented by hammers in order to clear all the bricks
There are more than five bricks but you can clear the window with only five strokes
Bricks that are adjacent to two bricks that have been removed will also automatically be removed
There are a couple of ways to do this ndash one way is illustrated below
Click to continue on to Nikopol rsquo s upcoming appointment with Gorgon at the cemetery
The Cemetery After another cut scene sequence Nikopol at last arrives at the cemetery and speaks to Gorgon
Gorgon is a creepy individual with strange eyes and open sores on his face
He seems oddly restless
His English is crude and he misspeaks frequently yet combines this with an archaic formal mode of address
He calls Nikopol ldquo hellip my son rdquo as a priest might but almost as an after thought
Gorgon has assigned Nikopol a coding task involving a small room that functions as a meeting room for the anti government religious cult
He hands Nikopol aRitual Manualthat gives hints about the coding
Do I Have to Read the Manual
To see a close up of theRitual Manualand read the hints right click to bring up the inventory
Note two small bluish buttons between the center circle and the outer circles containing the various items
Click on the lower right bluish button the cursor will turn into a magnifying glass
Click the magnifying glass on theRitual Manualin the outer circle of items
Note clicking the magnifying glass on the center circle when an item appears there will not allow you to read it ndash you must click on the item where it resides in the outer circle
You now have a close up of theRitual Manualand you can read the instructions hints for Nikopol rsquo s coding task
Note that the coding requires Nikopol to draw complex images on the walls of the meeting room with chalk it rsquo s a good thing he rsquo s an artist
It rsquo s strange that Nikopol rsquo s father rsquo s portrait is part of the ritual
And even stranger that Nikopol rsquo s mother rsquo s ashes are here in an urn ndash Your Mother rsquo s urn ndash Clemence Morganidon ndash
Perhaps Gorgon knows more about Nikopol rsquo s family than he has so far revealed
Click anywhere on the screen to back out of the close up view
Then right click to put away the inventory
Player Click on the shelf to the right of Gorgon and read about the results of the hockey game mentioned earlier
Player on the Lyon team almost singlehandedly defeated the Paris Kamikazes then publically denounced Choublanc
Who is this ruthless and courageous Player
Also noted is the execution of a general who conspired against Choublanc
This is apparently a frequent occurrence as Nikopol rsquo s response to the news is ldquo Another coup rdquo
Explore the cemetery which was once a butcher rsquo s shop
It rsquo s a bizarre place full of shelves with old boxes paper on the floor and now illegal religious icons and statuettes illuminated by candlelight
It rsquo s a miracle the whole place doesn rsquo t instantly burn to the ground
There are a few headstones that make it seem cemetery like but with concrete everywhere there rsquo s no ground in which to bury a body
Cemetery Orientation It rsquo s possible to become a bit lost here
To establish an orientation return to the place where you are viewing the scene below Note the location of the stoplight altar the vending machine and the passage back to where Gorgon is waiting
Turn left to see the Meeting Room where you rsquo ll eventually perform the coding task
Turn right to see the side aisle with boxes
After turning around degrees you can see the cold storage entrance with its vertical slat curtain
Click on the entrance to the cold storage area
It seems that the person behind the security camera won rsquo t allow you to go in there
Turn back around and proceed in the direction of the stoplight altar
Face the altar and click on what seems to be a cross but is actually a four way lug wrench

Turn right before you enter the cold storage door and proceed to the meeting room
It rsquo s dimly lit and has screen like panels on the walls
Now would probably be a good time to save your game
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on thelighterto put it in the ldquo active rdquo position
Then click on the candles at the far end of the room
Nikopol now has a light source he can hold up while he looks for a light switch
On the right is a light switch with a keyhole underneath it

You need to reach the hints instructions in theRitual Manualonce again now that you have assembled all the elements for the task
Or you can glance at the illustration below
Chalk Drawings First hang Nikopol rsquo s father rsquo sportraitat the center of the room
If you rsquo ve been reading theRitual Manualin close up mode click anywhere to exit the close up and then click on theportraitin inventory to put it in the ldquo active rdquo position
If you haven rsquo t been reading theRitual Manual right click to bring up the inventory and then click on theportraitto put it in the ldquo active rdquo position
Click on the blank rectangle on the end wall above the candles to place Nikopol rsquo s father rsquo sportraitthere
Next are the drawings on the walls
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on thechalkto put it in the ldquo active rdquo position
You know thatthe serpent goes on the left on the panel nearest the door so click on the left panel closest to your current position
A group of icons appears in front of you
Now click on the serpent icon and Nikopol will draw a serpent on the left panel closest to the door
Throughout thechalkremains in the ldquo active rdquo position at the bottom left of the screen
Note if at any point you draw the wrong chalk drawing on a panel simply click on the panel and on the correct icon and Nikopol will draw the correct drawing right over the mistaken one
Thecup is between the hanged man and the tree and it faces the horn of abundance
The most likely position from which the cup can be between two symbols neither of which is the already drawn serpent is the center panel on the right
Click on the right center panel the icons will appear click on the cup and Nikopol will draw a cup on the center right panel
Thehanged man is beside the cup and also beside the wheel though it is not on the same wall as wheel
That means that the hanged man must be on the far right side panel and the wheel must be on the panel that faces you and is between the portrait and the right wall
Click on the panel to the right of the portrait and then on the wheel icon and Nikopol draws the wheel icon to the right of the portrait
Then click on the far right panel and on the hanged man and Nikopol draws the hanged man on the far right panel
Since thecup is between the hanged man and the tree the near right panel closest to the door must be the tree
Click on the right panel closest to your current position and then on the tree icon and Nikopol will draw the tree on the near right panel
Thehat is on the same wall as the wheel so it goes to the left of the portrait
Click on the panel to the left of the portrait and on the hat Bishop rsquo s miter icon and Nikopol draws the hat on the panel to the left of the portrait
Thehorn of abundance faces the cup so it has to go on the left center panel
Click on the left center panel and on the horn of abundance icon and Nikopol draws a horn of abundance icon on the left center panel
There is only one panel left and only two icons that haven rsquo t been used yet
Click on the far left panel and on the skull icon and Nikopol draws the skull on the far left panel
The walls are now complete and should look like this Nikopol comments that the wall drawings are in the right place
Selecting the Best Floor Tile Now for the floor
Important Note There is an error in the Ritual Manual that makes this challenge much harder
Where the Ritual Manual mentions ldquo Crane rdquo it means ldquo Skull rdquo In the Big Fish Game version the error in the Ritual Manual has been corrected so that the Manual says quot Skull quot There are nine spaces squares to be filled with tiles and other objects
Picture the horizontal adjoining spaces as a ldquo column rdquo of three squares and the vertical adjoining spaces as a ldquo line rdquo of three square tiles as per theRitual Manual
The key tile should go under the skull drawing so place it in the far left corner of the floor
Left click to pick the key tile up where it rsquo s leaning against the wall and then left click to place it in the far left corner
Note If at any time you place a tile or inventory item object in the wrong space you can simply click to pick it up and in the case of the tile put it in another space or in the case of an inventory item object the item will go back into your inventory when you click on it and you can work with it again from the inventory
Thesalt goes under the cup
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on thesaltto put it in the ldquo active rdquo position
Then click on the right center space on the floor under the cup drawing
Thescale and the crown are on the same column as the key
This means that they go into the remaining two spaces along the left side but their exact placement in the left ldquo column rdquo isn rsquo t yet clear
Theurn is between the two pieces and the black cross
This means that it can rsquo t occupy a space on the left column or a space on the right column because of the key tile and salt already identified for those spaces
The urn must go on the dead center space since that is the only space remaining where the two pieces and the black cross can go on either side of it
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on theurnto put it in the ldquo active rdquo position
Then click on the center space to place theurnthere
Now for the scale tile
It belongs in theleft column and is on the same ldquo line rdquo as the black cross
The scale tile can rsquo t go in the left middle space because that would put it in the same line as the urn and salt
Click to pick up the scale tile and place it in the near left space the left space that is closest to your current position
The crown tile now goes in the left center space to complete the left column and the ldquo black cross rdquo or cross key goes in the near center space the center space that is closest to your current position
Right click to bring up the inventory click on thecross keyto put it in the ldquo active rdquo position and click on the near center space to place thecross keythere
The two pieces coins belong in the only remaining space that is next to the urn ndash the far center space
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on thetwo coinsto put them into the ldquo active rdquo position
Then click on the far center space to place thetwo coinsthere
Thesword is on the same line as the black cross
Click to pick up the sword tile and place it on the near right space the right space that is closest to your current position
This means that the tower tile goes in the last remaining open space ndash the right far space
Click on the tower tile and then on the right far space to place the tower tile there
What next
Suddenly the room seems even smaller
Click on the lock in the door and Nikopol notes that the key is still in the lock
This Manual is User Friendly Click on the bottom of the door where you see a bar of light on the floor
There rsquo s a plate attached to the door
Turn around and pick up thecross keyfrom the floor
Thecross keygoes into your inventory
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on thecross keyto put it in the ldquo active rdquo position
Click on the bottom of the door and Nikopol removes the plate making a larger space under the door

Right click to bring up the inventory and click on thekeysto put them into the ldquo active rdquo position
Click on the lock to open the door
Secrets and a Prophecy It rsquo s odd that Gorgon appears to have disappeared and locked everything up
Thekeysshould still be in the ldquo active rdquo position so click on the lock on the door to Gorgon rsquo s office ndash maybe there rsquo s something of interest to discover in the back room
Well it rsquo s obvious that Gorgon is more organized than Nikopol
Apparently like Nikopol he is a hockey fan
Right click to put the keys back into inventory
There rsquo s a paper sticking out of the books on the shelf above the bed ndash it rsquo s adecoding diagram
Click on it and it goes into inventory
Click on the books near the candles at the far end of Gorgon rsquo s desk
Read ldquo The Order of the Great Evangelicalal Return rdquo Nikopol rsquo s name has been added to the page describing a time of great change
Who is the beast that is ldquo hellip more aged than the oldest of the old rdquo
Perhaps one of the gods from the floating pyramid
And how would this beast manage to ldquo hellip take upon itself the face of the ordinary rdquo
And if the beast is one of the gods who would his descendant be
After reading this prophecy it certainly sounds as though Paris having already experienced years of poverty and despair is now doomed to even worse times
Though perhaps Armageddon would be an improvement over the status quo
And how does Nikopol fit into this prophecy
Click anywhere to put the prophecy away
Click to pick up the narrow piece of paper on Gorgon rsquo s desk ndash thiscoded lettergoes into inventory
Click on the photo that is also on the desk
It rsquo s Nikopol rsquo s father photographed at his court martial before being placed into forced hibernation in the space capsule
Gorgon has added a red pentagram to the picture
Click on the photograph on the wall and thephotogoes into inventory
Now right click to bring up the inventory
You can examine thephotoanddecoding diagrammore closely by clicking on the small circular button in the inventory screen ndash this button changes the cursor into a magnifying glass and you can then click the magnifying glass on thephotoand thedecoding diagramto see them in close up view
Note you will not be able to examine the coded letter this way
Thephotolooks like the inside far wall of the cold storage area back when this was a butcher rsquo s shop and not a cemetery cult headquarters
Thecoded diagramlooks like the Meeting Room in which Nikopol was recently imprisoned after he redecorated it
Under the bed is a briefcase
Click to pick it up and put it on the bed and then click to select a letter to read from the briefcase
That rsquo s an eye opener
Gorgon hasofferedhis services
Given Gorgon rsquo s knowledge of Nikopol rsquo s father what has he told ldquo Sergeant Luc Goliard rdquo
Interesting that the executive in charge of the Worship Authorities is a policeman
Decoding in Dead Earnest Figuring out how to read thatcoded letterseems like a very good idea
Click anywhere to return the letter to the briefcase and return to the Meeting Room
To work with thedecoding diagram you need to be able to see the squares on the ceiling of the Meeting Room which are barely visible in this light
Click on the small circle beneath the light switch and you rsquo ll learn that the switch works with a key
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on thekeysto put them in the ldquo active rdquo position
Then click on the circle below the switch
With the ceiling light on you can see all the squares with their symbols
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on thedecoding diagramto put it in the ldquo active rdquo position
Turn to the left to the small slanting shelf structure and click on it ndash this places thedecoding diagram thecoded letterand a third document with the number on the surface of the slanting shelf and shows them in close up view
If you click on the blanks on the document with the number a keyboard appears
At the same time some of the blanks on the document are highlighted in red as are certain words in the list on the left
These remain highlighted until you click on a letter on the keyboard which places that letter in the blanks that were highlighted
Apparently the blanks in the document are associated with the words on the list and also are associated with a letter of the alphabet probably from thedecoding diagram
Read the list of words ndash some of these are very familiar and are the same as the chalk drawings on the walls and the tiles on the floor
Looking at thedecoding diagram you can tell for instance that ldquo horn rdquo is associated with the letter ldquo K rdquo Clicking on the word ldquo horn rdquo highlights it and also highlights blanks on the letter
Click ldquo K rdquo on the keyboard to place the letter in the blanks where it belongs
If you are playing the Got Game version you will soon realize that the letter is in French not English
In the Big Fish version of the game the letter has been translated into English making this puzzle easier for those who are not French speakers

In the Big Fish Games version the message in English reads Player ndash Nikopol ndash the man from the stars resides in the bunker
Stop his son as quickly as possible
In the Got Game version the message is in French
For the English translation see below Player ndash Nikopol ndash the man from the stars resides in the bunker
Stop his son as quickly as possible
Someone seems to think that the hockey player from Lyon ndash number ndash is Nikopol Senior
Gorgon appears to have received instruction to detain or somehow stop Nikopol the son
That explains the importance of the portrait confirming both identities and why Nikopol was locked in the Meeting Room
Now would probably be a good time to save your game
Click the quot X quot at the bottom right of the screen to exit
Should You Trust the Jackal Headed One
When Nikopol leaves the meeting room he is approached by an Egyptian god ndash Anubis
Anubis ldquo Alcide Nikopol
Listen to what I Anubis god among the gods have to say hellip The shuttle that was transporting your father returned to earth a few days ago
Sadly Horus my horrid and deceitful congener subjected him to his will
Together they are going to disrupt the forces that hold Paris together and cause chaos in the city
You must stop them rdquo Nikopol ldquo My father
But but hellip why me rdquo Anubis ldquo You are the only one who can stop your father
Take this ankh it will protect you against Horus rsquo powers
When you have found him point the ankh at the pyramid
Then I will come and subjugate my brother rdquo In the exchange above Anubis is more cryptic than helpful
But he does confirm that Nikopol Senior has recently returned to Paris and he asserts that Nikopol Senior has somehow teamed up with the Egyptian god Horus who discovered the space capsule crash site first
Anubis doesn rsquo t say why Nikopol is the only one who can stop his father and doesn rsquo t comment on the fact that perhaps Paris could use a little disruption at this stage
Anubis gives Nikopol an Egyptianankh and tells him to find his father in the National Bunker this structure is also called the Montparnasse Tower and the Montparnasse Bunker ndash it currently dominates the Paris skyline
Once Nikopol Senior is found Nikopol is supposed to summon the gods usingAnubis rsquo ankh
Nikopol understandably stunned by this encounter agrees
As soon as Anubis takes his leave you hear Gorgon rsquo s voice as he attempts to give Nikopol up to the authorities
A timed challenge follows
Nikopol needs to leave quickly to elude the authorities at the gate
He needs another exit
Remember the cold storage wall with the ldquo Boucherie rdquo sign on it
Turn around and click to go through the cold storage door the one with the vertical slat curtains
Turn to the right and click to go to the far right wall with the Boucherie sign
There is now a hotspot on the frozen units under the sign
Click to move the units and then click again to go through the door
End of the timed challenge
Another cutscene shows Nikopol walking toward the National Bunker Montparnasse Tower
Nikopol muses that Gorgon was eager to betray him because Gorgon thought that Nikopol was about to fulfill the end time prophecy apparently as the descendant of the beast who would bring about Armageddon
Getting Past the Doorman There rsquo s a guard at the gate who won rsquo t let Nikopol through
Behind the guard are lasers that can incinerate anyone who is unauthorized to enter
Somehow this guard and the lasers must be circumvented or incapacitated
In front of the railing slightly to the left lying on top of a broken grate is aniron bar
Click to pick it up ndash it goes into your inventory
Turn further to the left and take the steps down to the Metro
Click on the gate that bars your way ndash it rsquo s too heavy to lift
To the left of the gate is a metal column with a rectangular plate at the bottom
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on theiron barto put it into the ldquo active rdquo position
Click on the plate it may take as many as four attempts to remove it
Click on what rsquo s behind the panel ndash it rsquo s a chain
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on thechiselto put it into the ldquo active rdquo position
Click on the chain and the gate rises up
The Underground Go down the Metro stairs
Look around at the tunnel and metro cars
Interesting graffiti
Click on the wrecked metro car and Nikopol confirms that the metro car is blocking his way
Turn back around and walk in the opposite direction where you rsquo ll find two metal doors over a metal cabinet
Click to open the doors
There rsquo s a console on the left ndash click to take a close look at it though you can rsquo t use it yet until you power it
Click on the ldquo X rdquo at the bottom of the screen to exit the close up
Note also a power regulator flickering screen on the right
Click for a close up of the power regulator
Before clicking on anything else note that there are four dials on the right of the power regulator each with a green button
The dials are labeled ldquo Line A rdquo ldquo Line B rdquo ldquo Switching rdquo and ldquo Console rdquo When the green light comes on for each dial it signifies that a portion of the console unit to the left is powered
You can only work with the console if the green console light is on
Clicking on the ldquo X rdquo at the bottom of the screen pulls you out of the close up and keeps the lights and power steady for the dials that were lit up at the moment you exited
Wait until you see the console button and the Line B buttons light up at the same time as in the illustration above
Quickly click on the ldquo X rdquo at the bottom of the screen
When you look at the flickering screen from this ldquo pulled back rdquo position you should still see the console and Line B buttons lit up beside the flickering screen as circled below
Click to see a close up of the console again
Now that it rsquo s partially powered up you rsquo ll be able to see screen images from the Metro security cameras and the lights delineating Line B will also be lit up
The left image is of the platform on Line A with the wrecked car where you are currently standing
The middle image is of the tunnel in Line B and shows a car on Line B that can be moved using the console
The right image is of the end of the Upkeep line and shows the front of a car that can also be moved using the console
There are buttons on the left of the console under the ldquo Power rdquo label that can remotely move trains on Line A and Line B
For these to work the console must have power to those particular lines from the power regulator you examined a moment ago
There rsquo s also a dial on the console to the right of the buttons this switches the tracks
The ldquo rdquo setting is for the Upkeep Line
To use the dial to switch tracks the ldquo switching rdquo button on the power regulator must be on
Line B should currently be powered since you clicked to get to the ldquo pullback view rdquo when both the console and Line B buttons were lit on the power regulator
You rsquo ll know that Line B is powered if you can see lights on the console as illustrated above
If Line B isn rsquo t currently receiving power you need to go back to the power regulator and get power to both the Line B green button and the console green button
Note The flickering screen power regulator has a feature thatmightmake it easier for you to control the power
If you click four times on the flickering screen you can then sort of control the power on the flickering screen by adjusting the position of four magnet like icons
Using these magnets you may be able to send power to the areas you want with a little more accuracy
However I never did find a way to do this that made the ldquo console and Line B rdquo or the ldquo console and Line A rdquo combinations constantly steady
And I never found a way to light up all four buttons at once
It rsquo s easier in my opinion not to click on the magnets in the first place and just to wait for the setting you need to be randomly generated clicking quickly on the ldquo X rdquo at the bottom of the screen when the right green buttons light up
However if you rsquo re finding that you just aren rsquo t fast enough then it may make sense to experiment with the magnets by clicking on the flickering screen
Playing with Trains ndash Step One The first task is to move the metro car in the Line B tunnel out of the way so that the Upkeep train can get through
The Line B car is signified by the lit up square on Line B on the console
If you rsquo ve followed the instructions above you rsquo ve already enabled power to the console and to Line B
Go to the console and click on the ldquo B rdquo button ndash look immediately up at the screen and see that the train on the ldquo Tunnel rdquo security camera screen is now moving away
Note since a track switch isn rsquo t involved you can move the Line B train while the dial on the right of the console is at ldquo rdquo or ldquo B rdquo or ldquo A rdquo Further note ndash if you have been playing around with the console chances are good that you rsquo ve ALREADY moved the train on Line B and if you look at the security camera screen for ldquo Tunnel rdquo you rsquo re likely to see just an empty track with no train
If so you should then proceed to the next step
Playing with Trains ndash Step Two Now you need to switch the tracks so that the rdquo Upkeep rdquo train can go onto Track A
Move out of the console close up and click to get back to the power regulator close up
Wait until you see both the console and the switching buttons light up and quickly click on the ldquo X rdquo at the bottom of the screen
In ldquo pullback view rdquo you should see the two lower buttons on the power regulator lit up
Click on the console and put the dial at ldquo rdquo if it isn rsquo t already there
Then click the dial to move it to ldquo B rdquo and then to ldquo A rdquo You rsquo ll hear a beeping sound to signify that you rsquo ve switched the tracks ndash you should also see lights on the console lit up on the Upkeep line zigzagging up to the ldquo A rdquo line
Playing with Trains ndash Step Three Move out of the console close up and click to get back to the power regulator close up
This time you rsquo re waiting until both the console and the ldquo Line A rdquo buttons light up then quickly hitting the ldquo X rdquo button at the bottom of the screen
In ldquo pullback view rdquo you should see the top button and the lower button on the power regulator lit up
Return to the console and you should see lights on the Line A portion of the console
Click on the ldquo A rdquo button and watch the security screens as the Upkeep train leaves that track goes through the Tunnel and ends up on Track A right where it rsquo s supposed to be
Night Crossing Ignoring the announcement that illegally crossing the border will lead to three years of imprisonment and hard labor click to go through the passage next to the train and cross the border
Walk to the rear of the train and note a ladder on the right leading up
Nikopol can rsquo t reach it
Look down at the ground under the ladder and click ndash the cursor turns into a rock
Click on the ladder and click to climb up

Right click to put theold knifeback into inventory
There are now two places to click up the cord the plug end near the wall and the exposed wires closer to you
Click again on the cord close to the wall to plug the cord back into the outlet and Nikopol notes that it is now dangerous
Note if you click to pick up the exposed wires end BEFORE plugging the cord back into the outlet you'll need to right click to put the exposed wires down before plugging in the cord
Now that the cord is plugged into the outlet click on the end closest to you the one with the exposed wires and the cursor becomes the exposed wires
Click on the border guard

Once the guard is down click on him to get akey ndash thearmorykeygoes into the inventory
Turn around and face the locked cabinet in the guard post
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on thearmorykeyto place it into the ldquo active rdquo position
Click on the locked cabinet and click to remove therifle with a scope
Without moving from the guard post look up and see the guard in the observation post above the moving flood light
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on thegunto look through the scope
Follow the floodlight up until you see the guard on the observation post
Move the scope until the guard is in the center of the crosshairs and click to fire
This is a bit awkward as the scope is always moving slightly
Fortunately you can keep firing over and over and the guard doesn rsquo t move and no one seems to hear you ndash aim for the guard rsquo s chest
Cross the road to the area near the security control panels and look back and up to see another guard at another observation post also with a moving flood light
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on thegunto look through the scope
Again you have unlimited chances to dispatch the guard
When you are successful the gun is out of bullets
Four guards down
Note if you forget that the lasers are enabled and try to walk into the courtyard you will die and will be returned to the point where only one guard is down
Lasers Off You now need to turn the lasers off
Click on the red box and on the wires ndash for some reason switching the wires doesn rsquo t turn the lasers off
Click on the laser control panel below the red box
The lasers are represented by the red and green lights at the top of the screen
You want to deactivate them so that the lights are all turned off
Look at the three slider knobs on the right

The lasers are deactivated Magnetic Pass Card ndash Code Now look at the screen on the right with an image of Choublanc
Right click to bring up the inventory and click to put themagnetic pass cardinto the ldquo active rdquo position
Click on the slot to the right of the screen and a diagram with hexagons appears
The guard rsquo smagnetic pass cardis coded for entry note the red configuration for code at the top right of the screen
Click on the diagram to get an idea of how it works
Note what happens when you click on the ldquo flags rdquo on the bottom of the diagram and when you click in the center of the hexagons
According to the map in the guard post the Montparnasse Tower rsquo s entry requires code
Note if you haven rsquo t paid attention to the map you will inevitably find in a short while that the only door you can go through requires a magnetic pass card with code
Click on the arrows below the red code configuration to find the configuration for code
There are also configurations for code and code ndash these are significantly easier to do than code and provide good practice before you attempt code
Click on the curved arrow at the center bottom of the screen to clear away any changes you rsquo ve made to the diagram ndash this resets everything
To code themagnetic pass cardto code First click in the center of the hexagons A B C and D Then click flag and flag
Next click inside hexagon B Click on flag
Click inside hexagon B and then click inside hexagon C The OK button near the top of the screen will flash and themagnetic pass card now changed to code will go into your inventory automatically
Breaking into Montparnasse Tower National Bunker
Walk across the street to where the vans are parked
Now would probably be a good time to save your game You can only move in one direction from here because there are still guards near the barracks
You rsquo re going to have to distract the guards
Note the alarm box on the wall
Don rsquo t press the large red button ndash this will bring the guard and Nikopol will die
Click twice to open the door of the alarm box
A timed challenge follows
Click on the ldquo on rdquo button and then as soon as the light comes on immediately click on the two grey wires to the right
As soon as you have control of the cursor turn to the right and hide behind the van
Then as soon as you see the guard arriving at the alarm box turn slightly to the left and click to run into the courtyard
You will arrive at a door where you need to use themagnetic pass card which is now changed to code
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on themagnetic pass cardto put it in the ldquo active rdquo position
Click on the slot and then click on the door to your left that has the code diagram on it
If you are caught during this process you can click on the pyramid to try again but you will probably have to recode themagnetic pass cardto code
Note if you don rsquo t manage to get through the door into the tower but aren rsquo t caught by the guard yet and can get back to the alarm box after he rsquo s left it you can click on the blue striped wire in the alarm box to bring the guard back to the alarm box so you can slip into the courtyard again and get to the tower door
End of the timed challenge
Another cut scene plays this time showing an attempt to destroy the jelly fish creature plastered over the top of the Montparnasse Tower
The jellyfish is a pink color that makes it look like a giant piece of chewed up bubble gum
Containment Take some time to look around especially up
You can see the jellyfish at the top of the tower and a huge graphic of Choublanc rsquo s face in familiar ldquo Your Beloved Dictator is Everywhere rdquo style
Talk to the guard and learn that Nikopol Senior is on the thfloor
The only things going into the Montparnasse Tower at the moment are the containers with new material to use on the jellyfish
The jellyfish is continuing to expand further and further down the face of the tower
If they can rsquo t figure out how to stop it soon they rsquo ll have to rename Montparnasse Tower ldquo MontBubble Gum Tower rdquo which probably doesn rsquo t mesh with Choublanc rsquo s sense of dignity
For what it rsquo s worth the name ldquo Choublanc rdquo translates to ldquo White Cabbage rdquo Becoming New Material Walk back to your original position before talking to the guard and then sneak into the side area with the fence and the containers full of new material
Everything is highly flammable ndash let rsquo s hope nobody tosses a match in here
There rsquo s one container where the cursor changes to show that you can interact with it
It looks as though there rsquo s no way around stowing away into one of those containers ndash but first the container needs to be unlocked
A timed challenge follows
Go back to your original position and the guard walks out toward you and then turns around to look up at the jellyfish
Quickly return to the side area with the fence and click again to go forward through the gate to the area next to the tower entrance where you can see akeyhanging from a hook in a small grey security box
The guard will only have his back to you for a short while so click to pick up thekey which goes into your inventory and then click to go back into the fenced side area
Note sometimes even if you don rsquo t see the guard walk away from his post by the time you get to the key the guard has left allowing you to swipe it
End of the timed challenge
Return to the locked container
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on thechest keyto put it in the ldquo active rdquo position
Click on the container to open it and then click to climb into it
The guards have an intriguing conversation while transporting Nikopol rsquo s container
An android XB is running against Choublanc in the upcoming election
XB was the android in Nikopol Senior rsquo s space capsule ndash the one monitoring his forced hibernation
Is XB following Nikopol Senior rsquo s orders
When the capsule crashed did it damage XB so that he rsquo s ldquo not functioning within normal parameters rdquo
Nikopol also learns that all the soldiers and guards have been ordered to assemble at the Elysee due to the recent coup
Click on the interior of the container ndash it rsquo s too dark
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on thelighter
Click anywhere to light thelighter
It throws a small circle of light which you can move with the cursor
Move it around until you see the lock mechanism near the top of the container
Right click to bring up the inventory and click to put thecross keyin the ldquo active rdquo position
Click on the bolt portion on the top right of the lock
This reveals the lock mechanism in the illustration below
Right click to put away the cross key and bring up the inventory and click on thechiselto put it in the ldquo active rdquo position
Click on the bolt plate to use thechisel ndash the bolt plate comes off
Then click on the arm to move it
Right click to bring up the inventory and click on theold knifeto put it in the ldquo active rdquo position
Click on the coil to remove it
Next click on the vertical portion of the spring ndash Nikopol inserts theold knifebetween the spring and the bolt plate
Click on right lower part of the bolt a bit above and to the right of where theold knifeis positioned
The bolt slips upward
Click on theold knifehandle to remove it from the spring
Right click to place theold knifeonce more in the ldquo active rdquo position and click on the bottom part of the spring
Now click on the latch and the latch slips upward
Now would be a good time to save your game
Click on the lid of the container and Nikopol climbs out of the container
Toxicity is Good You are on a terrace on the thfloor
Examine your surroundings ndash Nikopol Senior is on the other side of the building
There rsquo s a guard that you can see through the door ndash when you do choose to move into the hallway do so when the guard isn rsquo t visible
There are chemicals on a shelf but you can rsquo t use them yet and a grilled vent next to the shelves
Note it rsquo s strange but you also can rsquo t save your game here
A partially timed challenge follows
Wait until the guard has just left the hallway and click on the red button to go inside the hallway
Look around quickly
There rsquo s a door with no handle on the right
If you click on the red button to try to open the door to the left Nikopol notes that he can hear a guard in there
By now the guard on patrol is probably returning ndash turn back around and click on the red button to open the door that leads back out to the balcony and then click to go back outside sometimes the movement hotspot that takes you outside takes awhile to pop up ndash keep moving the cursor slightly until it does
There must be a way to clear the security room so you can enter it
The chemicals on the shelf of the terrace are now available for use
You can click on the chemicals and they are poured into the green bowl ndash if the combination isn rsquo t toxic enough the bowl automatically empties
Click twice on the grill of the vent to open it
Click on the control panel on the left to turn the fan so that it blows into the security room
Click on the unidentified white bottle on the right of the top shelf ndash the cursor becomes the bottle and you can click it into the green bowl in front of you
Then click on the blue bottle of bleach on the right of the bottom shelf and empty it into the bowl
Toxic vapors form
Click on the green bowl ndash the cursor becomes the bowl
Click to put the bowl on the ledge directly under the fan
If you don rsquo t do this quite fast enough Nikopol may empty and bowl and you may need to make the fume mixture again and put it under the fan a second time before it works
When done correctly you rsquo ll see a guard staggering out of the security room
He collapses on the floor
Note If you aren rsquo t fast enough here the other guard sees the body on the floor and shoots Nikopol
If this happens you can click on the pyramid when it appears on the screen to start the sequence again
This puts you back to the moment when the guard first collapses
The Security Room Click to go through the open door and then turn left and click to enter the security room
Turn around and click on the body of the guard ndash he is pulled into the security room and the door closes automatically
Ahypodermic pistol which Nikopol automatically takes from the guard rsquo s body goes into the inventory
End of the timed challenge
Look around your surroundings
There are familiar images of Choublanc evidence of hockey rsquo s large fan base and a small photo of the Montparnasse Tower seen from a distance pre jellyfish
On the desk you rsquo ll note some spilled coffee and the year equivalent of bags of Cheetos and freeze dried bananas
Three security monitors dominate the desk
The left monitor shows the guard in the hallway outside the security room
If you can see the guard on the monitor then the guard is in a position to see Nikopol instantly if he leaves the security room
Eavesdropping on the Gods Click on the central monitor and Nikopol overhears a conversation between Nikopol Senior and Horus
Nikopol Senior ldquo You rsquo re just playing with me
You rsquo re worse than Choublanc and all the others
You rsquo re egocentric totalitarian and inhuman rdquo Horus ldquo Of course
I rsquo m a celestial being bound by rules that you cannot comprehend
Nikopol we rsquo re going to take control of this city
You will govern the humans and I will take care of that pyramid problem rdquo Nikopol Senior ldquo Pardon me asking but that pyramid over there what exactly is it rdquo Horus ldquo There is no proper definition for it in your terrestrial vocabulary
In order to conquer Paris we need to first gain control of the fuel
With this energy Anubis and his lazy followers will be crawling at my feet
Their transportation vessels are very archaic
Without combustible fuel they are prisoners here rdquo Nikopol Senior is clearly regretting his partnership with this particular Egyptian god
Apparently Horus thinks his role as a ldquo celestial being rdquo gives him unlimited license ndash the usual rules especially the ldquo kinder gentler rdquo ones should not apply to him
The gods need combustible fuel for their floating pyramid
Horus hopes to use Nikopol Senior to replace Choublanc and take over the government of Paris
Once this is accomplished Horus plans to acquire the necessary fuel for the pyramid and use that fuel in a scheme to gain influence over Anubis
Click on the monitor on the right for some emails with interesting background information
Top Secret The giant insect like creature that invaded Nikopol rsquo s apartment turns out to be a tick that feeds off the jellyfish on the tower which is from Centaurus Alpha
The authorities have been able to communicate with the ticks but not with the jellyfish
Typical
The crashed space capsule containing Nikopol Senior and XB was meant to be a prison but it malfunctioned and returned to Paris
Nikopol Senior somehow managed to escape the capsule while leaving behind a substantial portion of his left leg which was frozen and then fractured at the time of impact
This makes Senior rsquo s triumph as a hockey player even more remarkable
Horus must have had something to do with restoring the leg
It was the authorities who sent the tick after Nikopol in his apartment ndash they have identified his smell and compared it to his father rsquo s smell
Somehow they know that the younger Nikopol rsquo s legs are both organic perhaps the tick could sense this
The last email has helpful information for anyone snooping around the tower ndash the guards in the hallway and security room we know about but there are also three more around Nikopol Senior rsquo s cell
There rsquo s no need to be careful in the elevators on the stairs and on the stfloor
Click on the ldquo rdquo symbol at the bottom of the screen to exit the email program
On to the Storeroom Playground Examine your surroundings
Turn to the right and push the red button on the device under the two ropes on the wall
It sounds like another door has opened
A brief timed challenge follows
At some point Nikopol will say ldquo I think the path is clear rdquo When he says this exit the security room
Click to go straight into the room across the hall with the door that is now opened that rsquo s what the red button affected
The door will close automatically
End of the timed challenge
Look around the storage room
If you want to take a break from the game it is finally possible to save your game here
Click on the freight elevator ndash the elevator door is locked
Pushing the red button near it does nothing
Okay try the stairs

You find yourself in a room that looks like it might be part of an art gallery
Turn around to observe your surroundings
There rsquo s a security panel near your position associated with the armory ndash the locked door contains a code diagram
Click to go to the other side of the room
All of the artworks are in glass cases making it difficult to examine them
This doesn rsquo t look like a public room ndash why encase the art this way
The owner apparently cares more for their value than for their beauty
If you click the magnetic pass card on the security panel Nikopol tells you that he needs to configure it in order to get in through the door
There ought to be another security control panel somewhere nearby that will allow him to do this
Click on the screen to view a map of this portion of the Elysee
Click on the ldquo rdquo symbol at the bottom of the screen to exit the map
Click on the red button near the door to enter the next room Note the countdown warning sound before the door opens
Listen to the surprise announcement
Choublanc seems to have surrendered to Horus rsquo plans
Is Horus forcing Nikopol Senior to go along with this also
Look around the room ndash there are three doors
Move to the other side of the room and click on the window
Choublanc has built oil refineries throughout Paris even in the Elysee gardens
Perhaps that is why the Egyptian gods desperate for combustible fuel have zeroed in on Paris
Look at the desk and the odd flickering figure
This seems to be an office but whoever works here apparently doesn rsquo t produce much
Perhaps it is Choublanc rsquo s office
Turn right and go through the door ndash this is a waiting room
There rsquo s another flickering figure and a beautiful gold plate on the table as well as a large hole in the wall ndash evidence of the recently attempted coup
Or did Horus walk right through the wall here
Go through the hole in the wall

The gun in the middle is CK
If you try it you rsquo ll find that its bullets will penetrate the glass but it rsquo s loud enough to alert the guards

Updated GAME BOOMER'S hints cheats and walkthroughs
Originally written by Heather ChampUpdated by Fugazi April Considerable text corrections and other updatesby Steve at Gamer Grand Central http www bigbear u net com frame htm Note Accuracy of detail in this walkthrough has been verified
While the order of play below is recommended it may not always be possible to exactly follow it to the letter
With luck this will not affect the enjoyment or outcome of your game
Well let's not beat around the bush he's probably dead
OK
Ten to one I am as well by the time you get to this I just thought it might be a good idea to write down those things I've discovered so that someone else can take over the investigation if need be
Jack's OfficeIt's probably best that you start where I started in Jack Slayton's office
During your search throughJack's desk Marjorie his secretary will probably call you
Turn around and switch on the intercom with the left button
Also listen to the radio which is left of the intercom and find out about Wo Tan the missing dog of former movie star Agnes Simon
Sit behind Jack's desk and search the drawers
In the upper left you'll find a key marked 'Joan'
She was Jack's girl atthe time and there's a key with a label numbered ' '
In the lower left drawer you'll find a journal which keeps trackof your actions and your inventory
Check it frequently
It might jog your memory about something you've seen but overlooked
In the top right drawer you'll find a small key which unlocks the Rolodex on the desk top
There's a handy flashlight in the second drawer
Now check the large double drawer at the bottom
Those are the six files Jack was working on before he disappeared
I was working on them too now it's your turn
Good luck
In the centre of the desk is another drawer
You'll find a magnifier there and a wallet with coins for pay phones
There's no limit to the amount you can use
Also don't forget to look in the dark matchbook on the left it's one from The Sheherazade Nightclub
There's a useful message on the inside cover 'Knock Twice Knock Once'
Now check Jack's desktop
Start by reading the newspaper but the news isn't exactly fresh As I said before there's a Rolodex with telephone numbers
You have the key so you can open it
Use the wheel on the left to turn the cards
It contains five important numbers
One of them is your informant
No names again but let's say this guy is looking out for you
To call someone select their card by clicking on it until the phone appears
It will call the number you wanted automatically when you click on the phone
To the right of the desk are some papers
Check them out
There's a leaflet from the Americans For Freedom In Europe some anti Nazi group
Now back to my story Sitting behind the desk I reached for the slide out drawer which has a small rim just above the upper right drawer and pulled it twice
It revealed a note with the combination of Jack's safe
After that I looked behind the painting with the bowl and the five apples
I knew his safe was hidden there
Using the combination the safe opened to reveal a lot of interesting stuff
There was a big roll of dollars
Not exactly an amount you'd expect a guy like Jack to have
You'd better take it with you like I did
Be sure to take the gun with ammo the security badge for Jack which had been given to him by Philip Watkins it could prove useful to get into Watkins' office
Leave the other stuff in the safe for now
Case THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF PEGASUSa k a
The Charles Winthrop Case I selected Charles Winthrop's file and studied it carefully
A mystery surrounding the death of a perfectly healthy racehorse
Nasty
From the office I used the map on the wall to get to
The Race TrackThere I entered and found my way to the stables
I took a look at Pegasus' stall which is through the door turn right and half way down the wing on the left
I didn't find anything important
I turned around and met Eddie Ranchero the jockey
He was devastated by Pegasus' death as was Charles Winthrop he declared
Eddie gave me permission to look around the stall even handed me the key
I returned to Pegasus' stall and unlocked the door
I turned on the light near the door
Inside I found a hypodermic syringe in the straw beneath the saddle
I took a good look at the feeding schedule and the newspaper article on the wall
I also found a business card from Mannie's Used Book Shop on the notice board
As I was leaving and waiting for the taxi to turn up I happened to look down at the ground
Call me suspicious but I had one of my 'feelings' when I found a clear boot print in the soft mud
The Winthrop MansionFrom the stables I went to Winthrop's mansion
I imagined Winthrop had some kind of built in security but I was determined
I entered the garden through the gate and looked up at the illuminated tower of his house
When the lights were out I sneaked through the window near the door and found my way to the study
By the way don't forget to bring your flashlight or you'll see nothing
When I found Winthrop's desk I found several interesting items
First of all I switched on the desk lamp err
I took a big cigar from the shiny box to the right
I can't afford these big boys from my expenses so I figured this would act as some kind of job perk
Then I read the note on the old man's desk
It turned out to be a prescription for Calcium Diazaline a medication for Pegasus
It was strongly recommended not to give too large a dose
Growing more suspicious by the minute I checked both drawers and found a letter from Winthrop's insurance adjusters telling him not to worry about the money so long as Pegasus died of natural causes
Besides that I found a copy of some contract concerning the Manorwood real estate project
Then I noticed the letter lying to the left of his desk in which Winthrop was thanked for his dedication and donation for the Refugee Rescue Fund located at Gower Street Los Angeles California
From there I went to the kitchen door and overheard a conversation between the maid and butler
It was clear from what they said that Winthrop was extremely upset at the loss of his horse and wasn't the same man he used to be Manorwood Real Estate ProjectHaving found the lead for the real estate project I went straight to Manorwoods
Despite it being after dark I still walked toward the shack but got sent packing by the guard
Back at Jack's office my informant rang to tell me the guard was real partial to booze
This gave me an idea I remembered Jack kept some hooch on the top shelf of his closet for emergencies
I turned on the closet light and grabbed a bottle of fine firewater
Then I headed back to Manorwoods
This time I entered the shack without any bother
In no time I found Mr Pollock's desk out back
For some curious reason I decided to check out the wellington boots all neatly stacked in a row by the door
I've not got the journal here but five gets you ten I found a match with the second set of boots from the left
Pollock was the guy with whom Winthrop had made his real estate deal
I sat down at his desk to do some serious reading
First I found a letter from Ackerman Geological Survey explaining that crude oil had been discovered at Pollock's Manorwood site
This was clearly a much bigger deal than building a bunch of crummy houses
Pollock probably got greedy
After that I found a letter from the bank telling Pollock his credit limit had expired and not to expect any more loans clearly leaving the guy with serious financial problems
No need to add that the original of the letter Winthrop had written Pollock in which he resign from their deal was here thus leaving Pollock as sole beneficiary as stated in the contract between them
Everything considered it was clear that Pollock was prime suspect for the death of Pegasus
And there to clinch the situation was definite proof I opened the middle drawer and found the used medicine bottle
Pollock was definitely responsible for the untimely death of Pegasus
Suddenly the phone rang and my informant warned me that Pollock was on his way over
I hid in the closet and watched as he and the guard talked about the medicine bottle then left the building
Later I read in the paper that Pollock had skipped off out of the country to England
Case closed
Note A There are three endings to the Winthrop Case
Instead of hiding in the closet you can also choose the following options marked as B and C Ending B If after you receive the warning about Pollock coming you attempt to leave the shack without the gun Pollock will see you and the guard will shoot you
Back at Slayton's office you will read a newspaper headline saying 'Detective found in Gutter'
Ending C If after you receive the warning about Pollock you attempt to leave the shack with the gun Pollock will see you but you will win the shoot out with the guard
Back at Slayton's office you will read a newspaper heading saying the same as in option A
Case THE CHINESE CONNECTIONa k a
The Charlie Kwan Case Jack's OfficeI listened to the audio tape Jack recorded with Kwan
I also read his file which I found in the briefcase below the main map
ChinatownI took off to Chinatown then realized what a maze it is there
To make it easier for you let me say that you should take a degree left turn and then go forward
From there go left take a degree right turn then turn degrees left twice
Take three steps forward and go through the wire mesh gate
Go forward twice and see the special mark Kwan mentioned and which was in Jack's file
I went through the door and then forward turned right and take three steps forward go right degrees left once more forward again
In my case I reached the second door
I went through this door and entered the storage room
Then I walked forward degrees to my right forward twice through another door on my right passed a third door and finally entered the secret laboratory
I found the broken vase and dish of illicit opium on the table
Then I met Charlie Kwan
When he had finished his story I checked his calendar for the warehouse address Eastern Pacific Warehouse Beach Avenue San Pedro Ca
I left the building and returned to Jack's office
WarehouseI checked the briefcase once more and found the map in there
I picked the warehouses as my destination
On arrival I walked towards the abandoned truck and opened the door
I reached over and released the hand break
The truck rolled backwards and stopped conveniently below the open warehouse window
I then climb in back of the truck looked up and sneaked through the darkened window
I walked forward and climbed down to find the missing crate Charlie had been so concerned about
Just my luck it was empty
Beside the crate I found a small case with a Geiger counter in it
I used the counter to check the crate
Wow
Some noise there in the straw
I examined the top of the crate looked at the labels and discovered it had contained Ming vases
Sure and my name is Shanghi Lil
I left the warehouse the same way I entered and walked toward the phone booth
Inside I noticed a prominent taxiadvert and rang them
I walked back toward the truck
My cab was waiting and took me back to Jack's office
Shipyards of Los AngelesOn the crate label I'd found the name of a ship 'Huangshan'
Again I took the map from the briefcase and this time selected the shipyards
From there I went to the ship up the left gangway and entered the ship
I went below until I found the cargo hold
This is the exact route I took Twice up the gang plank to reach the ship turned right went forward right again forward again then a left turn through the door and one step forward once more turned right went down the stairs turned degrees left another degree turn to my right a step forward a turn right and another step forward
I waited until my flashlight clicked on then took three more steps forward
Another turn to my right a step forward and two turns left
I found the crate under a heap of tarpaulins and netting and boy did it make a racket when I pointed the Geiger counter at it
Label said it contained humanitarian aid
Sure and my name's James Cagney
It's for sure this crate contains Uranium
Since when did the organization 'Americans for Freedom in Europe' have their offices at Peenemunde the German Wehrmacht V rocket base
I looked around and found a closed hatch after making these moves forward turn left forward turn right open door forward turn right forward which led to a room with two circular tap valves
I turned them both once and then turning right to see a third valve I turned that once as well
Suddenly the valves started pumping water into the ship
I made a quick escape and found out later by reading the Los Angeles Dispatch newspaper that the Huangshan had sunk
Oops
So much for Germans launching rockets at the UK
Case closed
Case THE CASE OF MAX'S RARE BOOKa k a
The Max Englehart Case Jack's OfficeI took out the file on Max Englehart
There were three other things Jack's typed report on the case the note from Max that Jack had mentioned and one other thing A business card advertising 'Mannie's Used Book Shop'
I suddenly remembered seeing a similar card in the stables at the Race Track
Of course
I quickly took Max's book from the safe
I was curious as to why anyone should want such an insignificant red book
I flipped open the cover
Inside the jacket was a really ornate pattern
In the centre was the Roman numeral I and a curling tail seemingly pointing to the letter 'G'
Curious
I didn't really understand it but jotted the info inside Jack's journal all the same
Max's HouseI went to visit Max to find out more about his book
I knocked on his door but there was no reply
I had an uneasy feeling and just knew I needed to get inside to see his place then I looked up and noticed the fire escape
Brilliant
I pulled it down and high tailed it all the way to the top and entered Max's place through the unlocked window
I found Max inside stiff as a board
I knew it was him because I found his wallet in his pocket this wasn't some cheap burglary for money then
I also found a note still clutched in the guy's hand concerning this notorious book
The note had been written by Philip Watkins but was he really desperate enough to kill Max
I also found something in the bathroom trash can a ticket for the Moonliner train bound for San Diego from Los Angeles
I figured it was of more use now to me than Max
I climbed back out the window and headed down to the street
There I took a trolley bus back to Jack's office Note When you're in Max's apartment where you find his body you can hang up the telephone receiver
Your informant will then call you to warn you about the bad guys and leaving fingerprints
You don't need to replace the receiver to successfully complete the game
Union StationBack at Jack's office I decided to follow the train lead
I got to Union Station and remembering the key with ' ' on it I searched out the lockers just right of the 'To All Trains' sign
The ' ' key fitted the locker far left on the upper row
Inside I found a note from Joan to Jack
She told him she couldn't wait any longer but had bought him a Moonliner ticket for tonight
I made a degree turn and walked to the trains
At the sign for Tracks and I turned left
There I found a conductor who told me he had seen Joan talking to Max
More importantly he saw her give him a book which must have been the one I found in Jack's safe
Maybe she also gave Max the Moonliner ticket which is how I found it in his bathroom trash can
When I got back to Jack's office I discovered the death of Max Englehart had made front page news
Joan's ApartmentIn the lobby I went forward twice then turned degrees left
I opened the ornate shiny door
Behind was an elevator which I activated with the 'Joan' key from Jack's desk drawer
It fitted the lock below the elevator buttons snugly and I gave it a quick turn
The elevator took me to the th floor
On opening the gate I took two steps forward turned degrees to my right stepped forward again and turned degrees to my left
Then again one step forward a right turn forward once more and walked toward the telephone
I examined the phone and noticed a drawer to my right with a white square button
As I nosed through Miss Goldie Locks' stuff I stumbled on her diary
Inside she d jotted down all her reasons for leaving LA and things she had found out about Myer Goolsby her boss at the Scheherazade Nightclub
She even said he was blackmailing the clients right there in the Club
When she left Jack was supposed to follow her but well let's say he must have missed his train After reading her confessions I put everything back and went forward twice turned degrees to my right forward again left turn forward left turn again forward right turn and forward again
Besides her secret diary I found some half burned letters in the bath
They were love letters not from Jack but from Philip Watkins him again
A couple were decidedly out of tone with the rest demanding that Joan return 'the book' which I guessed was the same book that had gotten Max killed and everybody else was running their butts off to get hold of
And guess who had it in their safe all the time
o Note From Joan's bathroom you can turn left and go through the left black door
You now enter a secret hallway full of Hollywoodland pictures
There's also some kind of a safe house
No known use for this place it's just great fun to look at
Watkins' HouseWith the help of Jack's wall map I found Watkins house
I thought it was time to confront him with the truth about Joan
He quickly buckled and confessed his dalliances with her
He thought she might give him back the book which contains codes if he went along with her special request
He certainly never expected her to up and leave so suddenly
After spitting out the rest of his sad story he wandered back inside the house he was clearly a broken man
Case A BREACH OF SECURITYa k a
The Philip Watkins Case It was now clear that Watkins wasn't responsible for Max Engelhart's murder so who was
However I was now really interested in Watkins
He clearly wasn't good at keeping secrets and for a government hot shot that was serious
Jack's OfficeI read the file he had on Watkins
I also listened to the tape in the safe made double sure I had Jack's security pass on me and headed for Watkins office at the Bradbury Building
Bradbury BuildingI took the stairs to the fifth floor and used the security pass Jack had left
On my way to the Bradbury I had studied this pass and found out that Watkins uses a different code for each day of the week
The numbers to indicate the days of the week is Sunday and the white and black boxes besides them indicate the switches
A black box indicates that switch is to be pressed down
Standing in front of the door I pressed switches and because after all it was a fine Saturday evening
A short buzz and I entered Watkins' office
See note below if you can't get in I turned on the light and examined the room
First I checked the quilted leather door and found some sort of vault behind it
I didn't have the combination so I left it
In front of the desk I looked all the way up and noticed a hole in the skylight
I rushed out of the office turned right stepped forward once and turned right again
Then I made a degree turn to my right
I climbed the stairs and got onto the roof by walking straight ahead
Roof Of The Bradbury BuildingOn the roof I stumbled toward the illuminated skylight and looked down
Sure enough it was Watkin's Office and there were some tiny footprints on top of the bookcase like those a dog might make
My theory about no one climbing through this skylight just took a dive Wo Tan The Wonderdog could have made the trip dead easily
Note If you cannot get past the office door code puzzle into Watkin's Office inside the Bradbury Building despite having the special security pass with you it's probable you've hit the bug connected with the clock in your computer
The door code can't be made to work on English computers
The date stamp is different from American machines ddmmyy instead of mmddyy so the game cannot recognize it or be made to work as a result
To complete the game you need to visit this office three times
If you are having problems getting into the office e mail me at rsvp bigbear u net com and I'll send you all three files
Note To proceed beyond this point you have to get a confession from Watkins and the picture of Niles from Agnes Simon
Case THE MYSTERY OF WO TAN THE WONDERDOGa k a
The Agnes Simon Case I rushed back to the office to read the Agnes Simon file and listen to Jack's tape recording of her
After all the radio had informed me that Wo Tan was her special dog and this little barking movie star was becoming more interesting by the minute
Agnes Simon's HouseAfter giving a firm knock on the door her rude butler Kurt Von Manheim let me in
He wanted to throw me out at the same speed but Agnes hailed me as one of her adoring fans
I was to come in and look around while she powdered her nose
I played along with the charade ignoring the butler's opposing request to NOT look around
After some minutes admiring the faded beauty of the house and its contents I discovered an illuminated picture of Wo Tan
Agnes returned looking radiant and grabbed this moment to tell me all about her clever pet
Interesting facts emerged about Niles her previous butler who was killed in a swimming accident
She showed me his picture which she allowed me to take as a possible piece of evidence
Then Agnes told me she didn't trust her current butler von Manheim threw me out on my can
Note You can't proceed until Myer Goolsby kicks you out of the Secret Room at the Sheherazade nightclub or until yousee Wo Tan steal the code book from Watkins' office
Jack's OfficeI'd just returned to Jack's office when the phone rang
My informant told me to get my ass over to the Bradbury Building immediately
I didn't hang around
Bradbury BuildingI entered Watkins office for a second time See note below if you can't get in
The phone rang and my informant warned me that someone was on their way right now to the Office
I turned off the light and hid in the closet
Peering into the room I watched as Wo Tan climbed down from the skylight onto the book case then the table and chair before grabbing a red book
It looked a lot like the one Max had died for
Wo Tan's 'masters' called him back using a distinct German accent
They then sneaked off with the third code book
I left the closet and turned on the light
Again my informant rang
He told me I had to find a way to open the security lock behind the quilted leather door
To get into those special archives I needed a three figure vault combination
Note If you cannot get past the office door code puzzle into Watkin's Office inside the Bradbury Building despite having the special security pass with you it's probable you've hit the bug connected with the clock in your computer
The door code can't be made to work on English computers
The date stamp is different from American machines ddmmyy instead of mmddyy so the game cannot recognize it or be made to work as a result
To complete the game you need to visit this office three times
If you are having problems getting into the office e mail me at rsvp bigbear u net com and I'll send you all three files
Jack's OfficeOn return to Jack's office I took Max's book from the vault and examined it
There was a strange drawing on the inside cover
It showed a Roman numeral for I and a special curl pointing toward the letter L I decided it was time to go check out Mannie's Used Book Shop
Everything now seemed to point to this damned book
I needed to know more about it
It's easy to find the book shop
Leave the office building by the main door no map reference needed this time and turn right
Take five steps forward and turn right again
Mannie's Used Book ShopInside the shop I met Mannie who was most excited to see me okay he was more excited to see I had Max's book with me
He offered to appraise the book even before I asked him
He showed me two more identical books
I noticed one was slightly damp and had teeth marks on the cover
I casually flicked open the covers of both books and examined the inside covers very carefully
Sure enough two more drawings just like the one I'd brought
I memorized the letters they had curls pointing toward the letters the one with the Roman numeral II pointed toward the M and the curl in the book with the Roman numeral III pointed toward R Pictures of these appear in Jack's journal for you
When Manny saw me examining the books a bit too closely he got a bit snappy
Next he offered me a whole bundle of money for my book
He was really excited and mumbled something about all three being a set and that they were really special
I wasn't particularly attached to the book and Max was already dead so I accepted the big wad of money
Far more use to me
After selling Mannie the book he almost turned light headed and told me to look around the rest of his shop at my leisure
After a while I found a door with the notice 'Employees Only' on it
Just at that moment I suffer severe visual amnesia and somehow pushed the door open in my distress
Inside I found a storage and book packing room
On the wall was a switch and I just had to pull it
Nothing happened right away but when I looked around a bit more I found a bookshelf that could be easily moved
I pulled it and the shelves swung back to reveal a hidden door
I opened it
The Secret Nazi Map RoomI'd found some sort of Nazi map room with Swastika's eagles and Adolf's picture on the wall
On the main table were blueprints for the Bradbury Building and they'd marked Watkin's Cryptography for special attention
Looked like it was their target
They also had maps for tracking troop movements in the war in Europe and a short wave radio on which to gather information
NOTE A word of warning don't touch this radio or it will alarm the Nazis
Also in this secret lair was a printing press for making propaganda leaflets such as the one I found in Jack's office
The very same one supposedly printed by the 'Americans For Freedom In Europe' campaign
Although it was a different fake organization the leaflet I found at Winthrop's place 'The Refugee Rescue Fund' was nearly identical in concept to these it also carried the same address THIS book shop address
The book shop is clearly a front for this anti Nazi movement in order to raise funds for those fascists
Probably the most important item was the telegram I found on the table
It was written in German but had been translated it read 'Message concerning the search for the American decoding device
Priority urgent
Colonel P Hansen'
I also found a classified drawing of a German V rocket
They wouldn't be building those for some time as I had sunk the ship carrying the necessary Uranium
I also found Agnes Simon's dog Wo Tan behind a further closed door
Funny place for that dog to turn up but as it would have been difficult walking out of the shop with a highly excited dog I left it there
NOTE Do not investigate the box with Wo Tan in or the Nazis will deal with you
Jack's OfficeBack at the office my informant phoned again
I needed to return to the Bradbury Building immediately I arrived at Watkin's office for the third time and used the security pass See the note below if you can't get in
I went straight to the quilted leather door
This time I had the secret code so set the three combination dials top one to G middle to M and bottom one to R Then I spun the wheel and entered the secret cryptography vault
I turned left and examined the stuff there
I found a lot of bits including a paper clip
Absentmindedly I picked it up
Then I looked around examining all the strange de coding equipment
Suddenly the phone rang I nearly jumped out of my skin
My informant had an urgent message the Nazis were on their way and now they had all three books and all three codes they were heading for this vault
I was still fooling with the paper clip and stabbed myself with it that gave me an idea
I turned toward the vault door and clicked on the mechanism
Then I jammed the paper clip firmly between the cogs
Just in time
I heard the Nazis squabbling among themselves just the other side of the door because they couldn't get inside
Hey with just a simple paper clip I stopped that Herrenvolk
I also solved both the Max and Watkins cases
Two cases closed
Case THE CASE OF THE MISSING HEIRESSa k a
The Harrison Smythe Case It was time look closely into the mysterious disappearance of Alicia Smythe daughter of Harrison Smythe
Jack's OfficeI took the film reel and the audio tape from Jack's wall safe
First I listened to the tape which gave me an impression of Alicia's over protected up bringing
Then I went to the closet and opened the door
I turned on the light examined the movie projector
I soon found how to put the film reel in place and switch on both switches to get it going
It clearly wanted to show the film through that square cut in the wall to the right
I went left out of the closet and took the picture off the wall to expose the square cut hole and then watched the movie
The film showed Alicia's birthday party some party say that was some brooch her old dad wanted to pin to her breast mmm
Seems there is more here maybe than just a doting father and shy daughter
Next I read the case file and picked up the picture of Alicia
Bar at the Sheherazade NightclubAlicia had last been seen hanging around the Sheherazade so I figured it was a good place to start
The Bar can be reached by turning to your right when you're facing the front door of the Sheherazade Hotel
Use the secret code 'Knock Twice Knock Once' from the matchbook in Jack's desk
Inside I walked to the bar and showed Ernie the picture of Alicia
He'd never set eyes on her but told me that someone looking that innocent wouldn't remain so innocent for long at Scheherazade
I walked toward the poster of Joan La Fontaine the club torch singer
Y'know there was some kind of resemblance between her and Alicia
Joan's ApartmentThe poster in the bar triggered something
I rushed back to Joan's apartment the same way I did before
In the bedroom closet I took a closer look at her brooch
I remembered now Harrison Smythe had given Alicia an identical one for her birthday
I touched the brooch
For sure both girls were in fact just one
Jack's OfficeWhen I got back to Jack's office the mystery of the missing heiress had already hit the front page Joan and Alicia were indeed the same person
Now if Joan was the torch singer at Sheherazade and the last sighting of Alicia had been at the club too I decided it was time to talk to the owner Myer Goolsby
I knew Jack owed Myer for some gambling debts so I took the IOU's from the briefcase under the wall map
I'd already lifted all that cash from the safe looked like the perfect cover pay my respects to Myer by also paying off Jack's debts check him and his joint out a bit
See what other stories Scheherazade had to tell
Sheherazade HotelI entered the main hotel paid the IOU's and got Myer Goolsby's approval to look around
I went upstairs and immediately ran into one of Myer's goons while noseying around the landing with the stuffed lion on it
So things were hotting up they were keeping an eye on me
I searched for the best room in the house
A sort of luxury suite with a mirror closet in it
I opened the closet door by now I knew Joanie's perfume anywhere
Then I returned to the landing area with the lion
I looked around until I discovered the hanging tapestry
The thing with Egyptian designs worked on it and pulled it back
I opened the door and went in
Secret Two Way Mirror RoomThe place was all set up with a spy camera looking into the best suite in the hotel complete with a high class sound recorder
I examined the recorder and amplifier then switched the tape deck on
I heard a conversation between Joanie and the Mayor Julian Higgins
They were playing a bedroom game called 'Mayor and Councillor' mmm
There were also a load of film reels
Looked like previous clients had already become 'movie stars' speaking of which I noticed one reel labelled 'E
Flynn ' well I'll be
I decided to leave the room in a hurry but just as I got out the door Goolsby caught me
He seemed pretty embarrassed I'd found his dirty washing but was brazen enough to throw me out on my can anyway
Whew close
Jack's OfficeI turned on the radio and heard a load more about the scandal at Scheherazade how Joan had stolen money from Myer before leaving in a hurry
Well that explained both Joan's disappearance and solved the Case of the Missing Heiress
The only thing left to do was get Agnes Simon's dog back for her
The best lead I had was the story about Niles
Sheherazade NightclubAfter my little run in with Myers I made sure not to go to the Hotel
Straight round to the bar again and showed Niles picture to Ernie
He told me Niles had been Agnes Simon's butler which I knew of course but it was pretty clear to him Niles was also her lover
Besides his personal opinion about the late Niles he also told me that the death was quite suspicious
Niles' body was never found after he drowned on Santa Monica Beach
Ernie thought somebody was trying to get at the old lady by getting rid of Niles
Could this mean Kurt von Manheim had forced his way into the butler job by murdering Niles and giving excellent but false references to the agency
Never liked the creep anyway
Jack's OfficeAs I walked in the phone was ringing
It was Agnes clearly agitated and she was whispering
She told me a messenger had brought a ransom note and I was to call on her immediately
Agnes Simon's HouseI threw myself into a cab
Von Manheim reluctantly let me in
I went to the living room and after looking at the picture of Wo Tan and his empty little bed Agnes started telling me about the ransom note
She then put the note on the table
I snatched it up
The bad guys stated that if she wanted her dog back that she was to come to the Griffith Observatory alone that night with big bucks and to tell no one
Agnes wanted me to go in her place and she was about to hand me cash stocks and securities to cover when Von Manheim caught us and kicked me 'raus'
Jack's OfficeMy informant rang and warned not to go to the Griffith Observatory empty handed
He reminded me that Wo Tan responded best to His Mistresses Voice
I went to the safe found the audio tape made by Jack of Agnes 'calling' her dog
I also picked up the tape recorder and headed for the observatory
The Griffith ObservatoryI headed toward the building and took the stairs to the left of the entrance
On the roof I walked toward the small telescope took two steps forward made a degree turn to my right another two steps forward and immediately recognized the crate with Wo Tan in it
Note If you examine the crate the Nazis will grab you and you'll be hypnotized
I left and made a degree turn
Then I took two steps forward a degree turn right and forward again
There I found the tape recorder
I pulled the switch but nothing happened
I was just wondering how to get power to it when Myer's goon the one I'd seen at Scheherazade turned up
Jeez that's all I needed
Curiously he warned me that the Nazis were a nasty bunch of thugs
He told me his boss had sent him and that Mr Slayton wanted me to have something special
Slayton
I thought he had disappeared
Well anyway the guy handed me an electric cable for the tape recorder
I played the tape and Wo Tan who always comes running at the sound of his Mistresses voice soon escaped from the crate
Agnes Simon was at last re united with her beloved dog
Another case closed
Jack's OfficeI read the Los Angeles Dispatch headlines
Sure enough the paper told it just like one of those old fashioned Hollywood films
Nice caption about Wo Tan 'saving himself' great twist
Then I switched on the radio and heard about the five hundred thousand dollar reward Smythe wanted to give to the person who found his daughter
Things Come TogetherThen someone switched off the radio
It was Jack
He told me he'd been lying low for a while to get Goolsby and the Nazis off his back
Joan was there too
They were both leaving to catch the Moonliner for San Diego
I reached in my pocket and gave Jack his ticket
Before he left Jack also asked if I was interested in solving some future cases Well why not
After all he told me himself
