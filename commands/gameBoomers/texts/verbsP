PHANTASMAGORIA Walkthrough by Susan Niles INTRODUCTIONThis Walkthrough has been written based on the UNCENSORED version of quot Phantasmagoria quot and is intended only as a guide to enable you to finish the game
If you follow it quot verbatim quot you will miss out on a lot of the small details and subtle changes that take place and add to your enjoyment of the game
It also assumes you have read the manual that comes with the game Every effort was made to ensure the accuracy of the instructions contained in this Walkthrough but errors do occur
Please let me know if you find any so I can correct them at the earliest opportunity There are certain things you should do every day and which are not included in this Walkthrough

Physikus comes on two disks
You have the choice of full or partial installations
If you can spare the room I recommend the full option even though it puts all of disk one on your hard disk around megabytes
It relieves you of constantly switching disks when you need scientific help
Either way you must insert disk one to start up then change right away to disk two to play
As if enough gamers haven't complained about this already
Lucky ones will have a DVD alongside their CD ROM and can use both disks simultaneously
Listen to the message on the vid mail machine and exit
That's all for now in this house
Go into the other house the one that looks like a boiler of some sort
This place is called the Smithy
First thing we see is a hot press
Close up we discover we can move the lever and pick up weights and hang then on the lever
Notice thelinkto the physics lesson
If we study about leverage it seems we can use one of the weights to generate kg of force
The kg is too much the kg is not enough but the kg in the correct position is just right
Thank you Goldilocks
So now what
We have nothing to press have a look around
Actually the shortestroute is to pick up one important item and go elsewhere for now
Turn around and to the right of the door pick up thebar magnetfrom the little shelf
Go outside through the stone arch up to the stucco house with the barrels on the side
The house is locked naturally
Examine the barrel area to see an kg barrel that could be raised by pulling down on the magnet
Try it
You can raise the barrel but it will not stay up
While you are there you see a place to use an object
If you check thelessonon mechanics you will find that the pulleys reduce the force by a third so you need kg of force to raise the barrel and to stick to the magnet you need something made of iron
So now we havesomething to do We found a press at the Blacksmith's we have a kg weight if we find kg more we can fashion a kg weight and get into this house from the cellar
Before you leave here look at the sign on the wall that says Watts Amps and a picture of something
Could be an elevator
Back up and go right to the bridge
Approaching the bridge you can click on the Sun for a view of the phases of the moon
TheLesson in Opticsis not to be missed
Wonderful stuff
You can play with lenses mirrors and see eclipses
And maybe Heaven forfend even learn something
Go up the swing bridge to the ship
It is locked of course
Look at the porthole to the left of the entrance
Open it to discover the device shown in the note from the table
Install the magnet from your inventory
Now the interesting part
The note refers to the boiling point of water
Is it deg F
Or deg C
Or did you study the lesson and find out it's deg K You can do it when it's right the door to the ship is unlocked
Oh to USE an item you need to find it in the little viewer on the lower right then drag it up to the location
A little kludgey I admit but it works
Go into the ship
Looking down is limited by the dark
At the top we find a telescope an electrical box and a frame shaped much like the mirror we picked up
Put the mirror in the frame
Look in the telescope
Very blurry
Check the side of the telescope and take out a lens
Look again
Not sharp but improved
You can also look out the porthole
Look in the electrical box and take the resistor
Go down the stairs
The light from the mirror allows you to proceed
All the way down find another kg weight
The good news is we have more weight
The bad news is we need kg more
Go outside and proceed to the 'Danger High Voltage' device at the end of the walk
Open the device and see V
Right high voltage
When you study thelessonabout resistance not the political kind you learn that volts divided by amps equals resistance
The note on the side of the house implied we want amperes
So o o if amps is what we need then
Put your resistor from the ship in there and make the total resistance
Divide it between the two resistors however you like another lesson
The green lights come on and the lift descends
Go up to the windmill area
Take the left side back to the generator building
F R and find another kg weight
That's all to do here for now
Go back down the lift and into the Smithy
Up the ladder and around back of the furnace find the horizontal wheel to turn on the gas
At the furnace light the fire and drop in kg weights
Pull the handle to dump the molten weights into the press
If you haven't raised the hammer before you must do it now
At the press lift the lever and hang the kg weight on the third slot from the end to raise the hammer
With the hot material in the press lower the hammer to form it then raise it again to retrieve the kg weight
Exit the Generator building through the green electrically locked door next to the transformer
Down the rails right through the gate and into the village
Across the village find the bridge and lower it with the wheel
Cross the bridge and back into the cellar
Switch on the light turn around and find thedead batteryon the table
Back to the village
Straight ahead is a dead end alley
Find the dustbins on the right and take the hammer
To the left is a door with an encoded lock
If you go to the door with the round panel hiding a combination lock you may feel stuck for it appears that there is no way to back out
Look carefully at the bottom of the combination panel and you can close the slide revealing the back up arrow
Exit the alley and go right to the Optical shop
Open the door by matching the lens shapes when they pause
Inside go behind the counter and open the top drawer taking thegreen filter Around front of the counter you can see abell jarthat rings when you touch it
Exit and go across the square to the door with the red button
Through the door find the wind poweredbattery charger
put the battery in turn on the charger and take the charged battery with you
Back to the village and down the well
Find the box and put the battery in
At the end of the corridor those bricks are just begging for a hammer
You have brokenintojail
Ooops the door slammed shut when you touched it
Klutz
Guess we need to set off the dynamite
Try lighting the fuse with your lens
Through the heavy door up the stairs and left into the Police office
Find theFileon the right end of the middle shelf
The graphic depicts sound traveling through iron What is the speed of sound in Iron Go to the desk and take the large key from the bottom left hand drawer
Go across the hall into the darkroom
Examine the photos
You can't see all you need to see because of the red safelight
Put your green filter in and slide it over
Now you can see adoor codeon the third photo
The code to the safe is
Go outside and into the alley where you found the hammer
Open the door to the thief's house with theIron code His name is Tor T Eloni
Cute huh
From the bowl of fruit take theGolden Sphere
Open the portrait to reveal the safe and open it with the darkroom code
Take theConcave Lens
Go to the ship and put the lens in the telescope
Look through the telescope remember a straight telescope inverts everything and scan until you see the code lock near the battery charger
You can see F
At that door you are prompted to study the laws of motion
Your hard work reveals that Force equals mass times acceleration
The F is hidden you should input m dot and a
Go to the transformer and set the windings
We don't really know the correct value yet but you canpeek at the answer
Push one of the colored switches it doesn't matter which Write downthe shape and color to save a trip back here
Go outside and up the ladder again to take theLead Pipefrom the empty tank
Back to the beach generator
Use the pipe to replace the broken handle
The generator is now generating
Set the windings on the transformer
We don't really know the correct value yet but you canpeek at the answer
Push one of the colored switches it doesn't matter which Write downthe shape and color to save a trip back here
Better go to the Observatory to figure things out

PHYSICUS Commentary and Walkthrough by Soren Andersen COMMENTARY If physics and math turn you off then Physicus may not be for you
Solving puzzles based on elementary Newtonian physics is at the heart of game progress in saving the world
It claims to be for ages
It comes with fairly simple animated treatises on optics mechanics electricity heat and acoustics that can be used as reference at any time at least after you master the game interface
However I must point out that it is a standard linear Adventure game in which something must be found or done to find or do something else in order to do that again and if spoilers are used to answer challenging scientific puzzles then the game flows along in a very satisfying manner
With regard to interfacing moving about is far from perfect
The scene shifts are abrupt no panning you may have to advance as the only way to move out of one or you may have to turn to one side or turn around and very frequently only one of these options is available
All but one of the cursors are identified on page of the instruction booklet the missing one is a reverse arrow that allows you to move directly backward from the screen into which you have just moved and at times it is hard to locate it as it may appear only in a particular small area of the screen
You will just have to learn with practice
The game designers have chosen to provide only eleven slots to store games which is insufficient since the Adventure gamer is always advised to save often
As you progress through the game you will have to decide which stored games are important enough to retain and store over the others
The inventory with its red and green scanners as described on page are devices that so far I have found to be unique to this game
There are numerous objects to be acquired green scanner but fortunately they are used red scanner before long so the inventory is not large at any one time
None of the inventory items are identified by name
The planet that is the locale of this game has a rather cartoonish quality about it insofar as the structures that you will find in it and the limited views that are presented make it sometimes difficult to identify what they are and their purpose
Carefully examining scenes as you pass through them will help
However the details of the graphics are superb throughout
As Mark Twain put it ldquo There is something fascinating about science
One gets such wholesome returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact rdquo Soren Andersen Feb WALKTHROUGH The opening video sets up the game premise ldquo Save the World with Science rdquo and is well worth looking at more than once for one thing it gives a view of the island locale that you won rsquo t get elsewhere
There is a view of the windmill as you fly by and it identifies one of the strange buildings as an observatory
You must pay attention to details about the planet saving impulse machine both in the video and the narrative
The Toonerville Trolley spacecraft in which you arrive has put you down on the edge of the sea at the end of a pier facing a gate
Go through the gate and enter the beach cottage the first of the strangely contrived structures of this game
Turn left and approach a wooden table on which is a laptop computer so to be designated shortly of a type that you will never have seen before
Click on it to have it unfold and a list of the five science engineering tutorials is presented
At this point you can take the time to run through any or all of these interactive treatises and it will indeed take time but it is not time wasted
Depending upon your attitude however it may get tedious
Immediately or at any time you wish to do so you can return to gameplay by clicking on the red button at lower left
Note when viewing the tutorials the controls for them are immediately below the screen on the right
The left one of these anoutlineof a tape cassette brings up a table of contents TOC for the tutorial being examined and from this you may choose a subject subdivision to explore
Also keep an eye on the interactive legends immediately above the screen at the right in the game as well as in the tutorials
Back away from the table and the laptop is no longer there because you are now carrying it with you to use as desired at any time by clicking on the green button at lower left
Turn left and a communications device begins ringing and flashing
Go to it and press the center arrow key to get a message that is a continuation of the one from the introductory video
You are to locate three generators and associated equipment that when placed in operation and properly adjusted will supply the impulse machine with the correct voltage to place it in operation and set the planet rotating again
Nothing more to be found in the cottage so leave and go left into the rocks and trees
After several forward moves the path leads to a stone arch and a butterfly flies across it
Take that as a sign not to press forward turn left instead and you will see two of the strangest buildings on this island one looks like a large metal oil drum and the other a smithy somewhat resembles a potbellied stove with three large chimneys
When you enter the latter the most prominent item is another potbellied stove resemblance on which is cast the legend kg
This is a drop forge with the hammer being the dark cylinder below the cast value and in front of the corrugated tube opening
On the forge is a black knob that when dragged to the right raises the white and tan notched lever arm bringing the arm back down raises and drops the hammer
What you want to do is use one of the three calibrated weights to have the lever arm produce a lifting force of kg at the hammer whereupon the arm is level and the hammer remains raised so that something can be placed under it to be forged
One way to do this is to try each weight in the seven notches along the bar until it moves and remains level however what you are supposed to do is click on the legend ldquo simple machines rdquo above the screen on the right and this will take you to the point in the Mechanics tutorial that shows how to calculate the solution which is to hang the kg weight in the fifth notch x
Climb the ladder to the left of the forge and find a furnace to melt metal that is fed down to the forge
The red scanner indicates that something goes in the bucket atop the furnace but you have nothing in inventory
Go around to the back of the furnace to see the valve to turn on the gas for it
Nothing to do up here since you have no metal to melt so return to the room below and look around before you leave
Resting on a round forging you will find a red and green cylinder that you will learn is a bar magnet
Click on it to put the green scanner to work and place the bicolored cylinder in your inventory
Leave and go to the other building
This appears to be someone rsquo s dwelling and recently vacated since there is a pot boiling on the stove
Two items are to be found for inventory a mirror above the sink and a kg clock weight
There is a rolled up note in a jug on the table that must be read it shows a puzzling sketch and a reference to the boiling point of water
Above the screen are two references that will take you to tutorials for magnetism and heat
Check them out
That rsquo s it for this area for now
Return to the pathway through the arch and proceed along it until you come to a stucco house with a ladder leaning on it and a woodpile on the left
Along the way be sure and note what appears to be a large trashcan suspended from a curved girder high above the path
To the left of the woodpile is a rickety wooden walkway ending at a stream that runs behind the house
On the other side of the stream is a raised drawbridge with no way to lower it so turn around and go to the front of the stucco house
The door is locked so move around it to the right
Here you find a barrel conveniently indicated to weigh kg covering a cellar entrance to the house
Affixed to the barrel is a rope and pulley arrangement giving a mechanical advantage of reference tutorial TOCMechanics Simple machines Pulleys
You can raise the barrel by pulling on the magnet at the end of the rope but of course it falls back when you release the magnet
If you had an iron weight of at least kg to attach to the magnet you could keep the barrel up and enter the cellar but you only have kg from the clock so you must find kg more
Before starting to do this look at the wood plaque on the wall of thehouse where you will see a drawing of the trashcan and the notations W and Amp
Keep this in mind
Go back to the front of the house then move to the right where there is a long walkway leading up to what appears to be at least part of a ship so identified by an anchor on it wrecked on top of a great rock
On either side of this walkway are pillars on top of which are representations of the moon and sun
If you click on the sun rsquo s disk it will open to reveal illustrations of three moon phases the significance of which will appear later
Proceed up the walkway to the ship hulk
You can turn the handwheel on the entry hatch but the hatch won't open
You can however swing back the cover of the porthole on the left
Get a closeup and lower the cover by pressing the red button and you will see the source of the sketch that you found in the oil drum dwelling
Moving the lower magnets will force the numbered upper ones up
The red scanner indicates that something is to be placed on the pedestal to the right and this is obviously the bar magnet that you have in inventory so do that
reference tutorial TOCElectricity Permanent magnetism Magnet and magnetic field
There are three values for the referenced boiling point of water depending upon which temperature scale is used
Fahrenheit is not used in scientific work leaving Centigrade Celsius and Kelvin
Go to the Heat tutorial TOC and choose Melting and Boiling from Aggregation States where you will be told that the boiling point of water is C
There will be a device for you to raise and lower water temperature so that it boils or condenses and there is a temperature readout in both Centigrade and Kelvin
Watch these readouts and note the Kelvin reading when the Centigrade reading momentarily is
Move the magnets in the unit in the porthole to this Kelvin value and the hatch will open when you turn the handwheel
Enter the ship
To the left is only darkness you can turn around and go that way but it is pointless
Go up the ramp to the right and into a room containing a telescope and an adjustable frame with an oval opening in the center
A closeup of the frame brings up the red scanner if you look in inventory you will see that the mirror you got in the drum dwelling has the right shape to fit and indeed it does so that now light from the broken porthole is reflected down the ramp and the far end is no longer dark
Go down there to find and pick up another kg weight
Return to the telescope
Get close to it and you can then move to look out the porthole and see a tan tower of stepped construction with trees at its base
Look through the scope and you will see a very blurred image of the tower
Lift the cover on the top of the scope to get a lens for inventory
Now when you look through the scope you see a much improved image but still blurred
Look around for a glass fronted cabinet
Inside above a yellow triangular high voltage warning icon is a red tapered cylinder with three green stripes on it this is a resistor and it goes into inventory
Leave the ship and head down the walkway
About half way down you get a good view of the windmill high on a large boulder mdash note that the sails are not rotating and near its base can be seen the suspended trashcan the black mark on the rock face is the can rsquo s shadow
Continue moving straight ahead toward the windmill rock and you will come to a metal box with the high voltage icon in it
Click on the tan handle on the right side of the box and hold down the mouse key until a click is heard then pull the handle and the box lid will rise
Inside is an obvious location for the resistor that you have just put in inventory so place it there
These are very special resistors that exist only in this game because their values can be set by the switches in their holders
In the Electricity tutorial under the Current voltage resistance section of the Electrical Circuit exposition you learn that resistance is equal to voltage divided by current R V A
The voltage is right there on the panel volts
The amperage value however takes a little intuition you are right under the suspended trashcan and the plaque on the stucco house on which was the can drawing showed Amp
Using these values the resistance is calculated to be ohms
This is a total value and since the resistors are in connected series their values can be set to any pair that totals
Push the red ON switch the red pilot light comes on and the resistance setting switches are activated
Set them so the total is and the green pilot light comes on
Click and hold the tan handle then push it back to close the box lid whereupon the trashcan descends and is revealed to be an elevator
Enter the elevator push the up button and click on the door to exit when the elevator stops at the base of the windmill
What is the energy source that runs the elevator
The door to the windmill is locked of course but you can go around to the shed at the back in which you find the first of the three generators that you are to work with
It is not in operation
There are switches and transformers on the walls but with no electricity none of them work
In a corner behind the generator however is another kg weight
Now you have the needed kg total so you must make a weight of that value
Return to the elevator take it down step out and turn right to go back to the smithy and the drop forge
When you get there move the black knob on the forge to raise the hammer lifting lever hang the weight on it so that it is level and the hammer is up and go up the ladder to the furnace
Put the three kg weights in the bucket on top of the furnace the scale will register each weight as you put it in
Go behind the furnace and open the gas valve then push the FIRE button on the front of the furnace to ignite the gas
The fire produced must be exceedingly hot because it immediately melts the iron weights so that when you pull down the arm that is on the right of the furnace the molten iron flows down to the forge
Go down to the forge and click on the black knob to release the hammer onto the smoking hot metal and forge the kg weight
Use the kg weight to raise the hammer once more and put the new weight in inventory
It rsquo s back to the side of the stucco house where you can affix the weight to the magnet
Now when you pull the magnet down it stays down and the barrel is clear of the cellar entrance so that you can go in
It is pretty dark in there and the light does not come on if you pull the switch cord still no electricity
Try raising the trapdoor leading into the house at the top of the ladder
Can't be done but you can find a key hanging just to the right of it
The last place that a key was needed was to open the lock on the door to the base of the windmill
Go through the routine with the metal box to bring down the elevator then go up and try the new key with the door lock
It works and you can enter the windmill
Inside there is a shaft coming down to turn the millstone and a power takeoff shaft toward the shed behind undoubtedly to drive the generator
You are not here to grind grain so turning the millstone is wasted energy
Slide the block that rests in the millstone shaft slot up the shaft past the catches and the millstone is disengaged
Climb the ladder to the floor above where you can pull a lever that releases the clamps on the windmill shaft cam and the sails and shaft begin to rotate
Go to the shed in back to find that the generator is running
To the left of the generator is a triple locked green door that may be unlocked by a switch to its left
On the right of the green door mounted on the wall is a transformer with an adjustable pickoff on one coil a damaged voltmeter and three triangular colored lights that may be turned on one at a time
Tutorials are suggested on magnetism and optical colors
Turn around to the entrance door to the right of which is a switch with a drawing of a house tacked next to it
Flip the switch to the position
This drawing could well be the stucco house and flipping the switch on may supply electricity to it but rather than going back to check at this time go out the green door for more exploring
You emerge at the top of a trestle that has tracks going steeply down to an inoperative railcar
Take a moment while at the top to examine what can be seen which is primarily the Observatory on the left and a village square on the right
At the bottom of the trestle go left to investigate what may be found including the Observatory and a beached submarine with a bucket of ice on top of it and a large mirror behind it
When you get behind this mirror it will be seen to actually be a parabolic reflector and the red scanner appears on it
Inside the submarine is another idle generator
There is nothing that may be done in this area now but you have noted several things for future action
Return to the trestle and proceed beyond it through the gate into the village
There are a number of places to inspect around the square start with the spoked wheel on the pillar at the right
When you are facing the wheel click on it and the drawbridge goes down
Cross the drawbridge to the wooden walkway and onward around the house to the cellar entrance
Raise the barrel and enter the cellar pull the light switch cord and now the light comes on
Apparently the switch in the generator shed did indeed supply electricity to the house
With light you can now see several items on a table in the corner to the right of the entrance one of these being a battery connected to a table lamp
Throw the switch on the top of the lamp the bulb glows briefly then goes dark
Evidently you have exhausted what little charge the battery had left
The green scanner indicates that you should put the dead battery in inventory
Return to the square and move straight ahead from the drawbridge to the low stone steps and into the short alley
On the left is a door with a lock for which you do not have the code but if you do examine it click on the panel handle to raise it so the arrow cursor to back away becomes visible
Across the alley from the door are some trash barrels one of which contains a hammer that will doubtless be useful
Leave the alley and turn right to see a house with a display window and a door on which is a mailbox sized lock unless it reallyisa mailbox
Move to it and click on the lock raising the cover and showing four lens and reflector types below a display screen
Press the red button to begin a rapidly changing random showing of the lenses and their associated light rays and which pauses briefly once in a while
When this happens you are to click on the lens type displayed and if you do this correctly in the very short time allowed a red light turns green do this three times without making a mistake and the changing display becomes static and you can click again on the red button to open the door
However if you make a mistake a green light becomes red
The easy way to do this is to pick a shape with the cursor and wait for it to show up in the pause
Items inside the house indicate that this is an optical shop
You can find a crank on a pedestal under a glass cover but you can rsquo t remove the cover to get it though clicking on the cover produces a pleasant note
On the desktop beside the crank the red scanner indicates that something should be placed there but nothing in inventory will work
Get behind the desk to open the top drawer and get a green filter
Leave the shop
Across the square is a door in which there is a red disk
Move to it and press the disk to open the door where there is a sandy courtyard and a stone paved walkway
At the far end of the walkway is a wind driven device with wires leading to an electric meter on a table next to it
To the right of the meter is a holder that activates the red scanner and the only thing electrical in your inventory is the dead battery which will remain when placed there
Throw the switch on the meter and the needle moves to the upper end of the scale
You have recharged the battery and the scanner is now green so return the battery to inventory
Back off and turn right
Here you see pair of large double doors locked of course as you discover when you get close to the handle to open them
In the crack between the doors you can also the locking bar on the other side
The red scanner is active on the sign
Return to the village square
You haven rsquo t yet examined the well in the center of the square
Do that and looking down into it you will see a ladder
You will also see what appear to be snakes but are only tree roots
Climb down the ladder and before you get to the water at the bottom you can enter a dark tunnel in the well wall
On the side of the tunnel is a cabinet
Open it
Here the programmers have made an omission the red scanner is supposed to show near the bottom of the cabinet but it doesn rsquo t Put the battery in the cabinet and close the door
A light is now on and you can proceed into the tunnel which terminates at a brick wall
Drag the hammer from inventory to the bricks click on it and in one blow it will break an opening
When you go through the opening you will be in the village jail and in fact in a jail cell as attested by a bed in it
Move to the bed and turn right to the door when you try to leave the door opens a little then swings back and locks
Not to worry someone has very conveniently left three dynamite sticks attached to the lock
Get a closeup then place the lens from inventory in the light coming from the cell window and ignite the hanging fuse the dynamite explodes without injuring you or destroying the dynamite blowing the door open and you may leave the cell
Go left to find the exit door then up the stairs to a vestibule
On the left is a door to police headquarters
In it there is a desk that has a key in the lower left drawer and on top an arrest warrant for a thief at an address that you won't be able to find though it indicates that it is on the square
He has stolen a lens
On the wall behind the desk is a multitude of case files and passing the cursor over the black disks will show that youcan examine two in the middle row
The one on the left is irrelevant
The other one shows a drawing of a sound source impinging on a bar with the m s sound velocity desired
Go to the tutorialAcoustics Sound waves Speed of soundwhich shows three examples of the three the one in the drawing could only be iron and the value is given
The drawing also says this is the access code to the thief rsquo s address
Go across the vestibule to the door that leads to the police darkroom
Here you will find three photographs hanging
Get closeups of all three and note the wallpaper pattern in
Now find the light on the ceiling and place the green filter in the blank space indicated by the red scanner
Click on this filter to have it replace the red one and under this light color code numbers will be seen in photo
Leave the darkroom unlock the vestibule door go out into the square and on to the alley where you found the hammer
Click on the round lock cover then on the panel handle to lower it
Enter the iron sound speed value and again click on the panel handle to raise it
Back off and click on the door latch to open the door
Inside the room are the many objects that the thief has stolen and from these you want to get a golden sphere that is in a bowl of apples
On the wall is the lady rsquo s portrait of darkroom photo and next to it the wallpaper pattern of photo
Click on the right edge of the portrait to have it swing back and reveal the safe of photo
Enter the code from photo turn the handwheel to open the safe wherein is the lens for which the arrest warrant was issued
Take the lens close the safe and the portrait and leave the house
Recall that you removed a lens from the telescope in the ship and that the image was not all that clear with or without it
Now you have a replacement lens so go over the drawbridge and up the ramp into the ship and to the telescope where you can put the thief rsquo s lens in it
The view is now clear but much more magnified and limited
You can use your mouse to move it around and you will find that you can look at the double doors that are in the courtyard next to the battery charger
You can zero in on the and a place code lock beginning with an F Knowing what the scope is viewing is a good hint that you should go there
Return across the drawbridge to the village square go through the red disk gate beyond the well and into the courtyard where the locked gate is
When you get a closeup of the lock close scrutiny of the reveals that it is a keyhole and you have in inventory a key that fits
Insert the key turn it and the cover panel moves aside to show the lock
The first place is covered but you know from the telescope view that it contains an F You are referred to Mechanics and motion
Call up the tutorial TOCMechanics Motion Force and acceleration click on the next page arrow below the screen and the code for the lock is right there as Newton rsquo s second law Force is equal to mass times acceleration F m bull a With the last four of these five characters in place in the lock code pull on the lever which swings all the way over and back the cover slides back over the code and you are looking at the doors with the locking bar no longer visible in the crack between them
Use the right hand latch to open the door and go through Ahead you will see the tower that you saw when looking out the broken porthole of the ship and a couple of spherical buildings
On the right is another generator including a transformer on it that is much like the one in the shed behind the windmill except that the buttons are square
Turn around to explain something that should have puzzled you how you could have seen the door code lock from the telescope including the reversed covered F before you used the key to slide the cover panel back
Proceed toward the water
If you try the doors in the several buildings you will find all of them locked including the one in the tower
Note that this door has a sun icon over it
Nothing you can do with the generator either except break off a handle on the other side
The sound of running water is quite pronounced whenever you are next to the generator
When you get to the shore go out on the pier at the right and read a note in a floating bottle indicating the Observatory lock code as being the density of chlorine
Call up the tutorial TOC forMechanics Force mass density Densityand click on the next page arrow at the bottom of the screen for the answer
At the shore instead of going to the pier you can move to the left along a short walkway and here you will find a door that will open
Go to the puzzle built into the table on the left and place the golden sphere from inventory into the hole at the bottom next to the other two
The layout represents the sun shining on the earth and locations of the eight phases of the moon three of which are to be selected by placement of the three small spheres
The key to this puzzle is the sun disk that is on the right pillar of the walkway to the ship which when opened showed a waning crescent moon a full moon and a waxing crescent moon
Access the TOC of tutorialOptics Light and shadow Phases of the moonfor an animated display of the moon orbiting the earth with the continual changing illumination of the moon as this happens
Note the position of the moon in orbit when the moon illumination is that of the above three shown in the sun disk and place the three small spheres in those positions around the earth sphere
If you do it correctly the sun will spin
Do not press the orange button which resets the puzzle unless the sun does not spin in which case you must try again after resetting
The spinning sun leads you to the door in the tower since it has a sun icon over it
The door is now unlocked and upon entering it looks as though you have found something of a shrine with a tuning fork and a striker on the central altar
Use the striker to tap the fork and if you are musically adept you will recognize the note as being the same as the one from striking the glass cover in the optical shop
That is now the place to go after putting the tuning fork in inventory
After you get to the shop and go through the door lock opening procedure again enter and put the tuning fork on the desk next to the glass covered crank
Click on the striker to sound the tuning fork and the resonance will shatter the glass and you can pick up the crank
Reference tutorial TOCAcoustics Oscillation and sound Resonance
There does not seem to be anything to indicate how to use this item but you have not as yet done anything in the area beyond the trestle and Observatory that you explored earlier so go there
On the back of the parabolic reflector is a hole that accepts the crank which when turned moves the reflector to focus concentrated sunlight on the bucket of ice atop the submarine
Climb the ladders to look at the bucket and observe that the ice has melted and the resulting water is agitated presumably near the boiling point
There is a piece of pipe on the bottom of the bucket under the hot water
Climb back down and enter the submarine
Turn left to a boiler then look up to a valve
Turn the valve to the drain the water from the bucket into the boiler and click on the FIRE button on the front of the boiler whereupon steam makes the generator operational
To the right of the generator is a transformer differing from that the others in that the buttons are round and the voltmeters are unbroken
Go back up to the empty bucket to retrieve the piece of pipe that you can use to replace the handle that broke off the beach generator
While you are here near the Observatory and you have the code for the door lock you may as well investigate that
Climb the steps and get a closeup of the lock then click on the panel handle to slide it down
Enter the number for the density of chlorine
This is the British version of a German game Europeans usually use a comma instead of a decimal point
Raise the panel and click on the orange button to open the door
Go up the stairs to the control room
Look over the control panel to see what is there and look out the window above it to see the impulse machine set to go
However the most important thing at this time is the sketch tacked to a panel you have had a glimpse of this drawing in the message left on the communications unit in the beach cottage at the beginning of this game review it
in which the scientist behind the rescue effort says it contains the exact figures to launch the impulse machine and that you must set the transformers to supply the few volts that he could not
The information and formulas that you will need may be found in the tutorial on Electricity TOC chapters and pages
The basic data from the sketch is that you will have to supply the impulse machine watts at amps from the three generators
Using the formula at the sketch top W e I it may be calculated that you must generate volts
Hardly a ldquo few rdquo volts
Now some investigation is in order
Go to the transformer in the submarine which shows that the steam driven generator is putting out volts as indicated by the voltmeter below the primary coil
The tap on the secondary coil has three positions of and turns or turns ratios of and and thus the transformer output is x volts x volts or x volts depending on the tap setting
These voltage values are seen in the voltmeter below the secondary coil as the tap is moved
Go to the transformer in the windmill shed which shows that the windmill driven generator is putting out volts as indicated by the voltmeter below the primary coil
The tap on the secondary coil has three positions of and turns or turns ratios of and and thus the transformer output is x volts x volts or x volts depending on the tap setting
These voltage values must be calculated because the output voltmeter is broken
Go to the remaining generator on the beach and put the pipe from inventory in the place where thehandle broke off
Click on the pipe to move the large shaft below it and free the waterwheel to rotate and drive the generator
Go around the generator to the transformer on the other side which shows that the waterwheel driven generator is putting out volts as indicated by the voltmeter below the primary coil
The tap on the secondary coil has three positions of and turns or turns ratios of and and thus the transformer output is x volts x volts or x volts depending on the tap setting
These voltage values must be calculated because the output voltmeter is broken
In summary the available voltages to be added one from each generator to equal are Submarine Windmill Waterwheel Turns Volts Turns Volts Turns Volts With being a nice round number it is not much effort to select and as the ones that you want and to set the secondary taps accordingly
While you are at the waterwheel beach generator set the transformer secondary coil tap at turns so the output will be volts
Click on one of the square buttons it does not matter which one as long as you note the shape and color
Go to the windmill generator and set the transformer secondary coil tap at turns so the output will be volts
Click on one of the triangular buttons it does not matter which one as long as you note the shape and color
Go to the submarine generator and set the transformer secondary coil tap at turns so the output will be volts
Click on one of the round buttons it does not matter which one as long as you note the shape and color
Return to the Observatory control panel and move the toggle switch on the left from to
The displays above the panel should show the numbers and
Adjust the colored push switches so the circle triangle and square shapes are the colors you chose at the transformers
From the five resistors select the one that produces amps on the meter
Push the red TEST button and if the green pilot light flashes you are ready to go
Move the handle on the right from bottom to top and watch the concluding video
SPOILERS Moon phases puzzle solution The boiling point of water is K
The velocity of sound in iron is meters sec
The density of chlorine gas is kg cubic meter

Pink Panther Hokus Pokus PinkWalkthrough By Salar of MystIs this game ldquo just for little kids rdquo No some of the quotes references and humor will go right over their heads
The developers definitely had the K A group in mind The puzzles aren rsquo t that hard but several are not particularly intuitive and some of the pixel hunts aren rsquo t going to be that easy for little ones unaided
I gave Pink Panther to my year old son and found myself pitching in when he got stuck
There's a hint function included but it doesn't mention where the exits are onscreen etc and that's the kind of thing that had him stuck Educational value
I did find myself reading many of the passages in the quot Book of Knowledge quot but my son wasn rsquo t nearly as interested and mostly benefited from the many little speeches and the songs inside the game itself
I expect that rsquo s typical The Book of Knowledge can help you solve some of the puzzles or at least identify your objectives but didn rsquo t seem to be strictly necessary as the same clues were available elsewhere in the game
The game begins with a spell gone awry
An irritable young wizard has made a sweet young girl cry
Pink Panther is dragged in without further ado
His book rsquo s contents are lost if he doesn rsquo t help too
But the narrator is not the one that you think
An old wizard rsquo s behind the troubles of Pink You begin in the mansion outside the boy rsquo s room
Pink Panther gives up his first thought that this short tale of gloom was just a strange musing a horrible dream but then realizes oh dear that he needs the latrine But the Butler is blocking and won rsquo t allow him to go unless the big anxious cat can pay his small toll There rsquo s nothing to do here so onward we go
Your game cursor is a cartoon esque gloved hand that has ldquo rays rdquo around the finger in a reactive area
Traditional arrows show you possible exits
The one behind Pink is locked so downward is the way on Two blue curtains left and right at the bottom of the stairs give your first choice
Let rsquo s go left
It rsquo s the dining room
After commenting on the ldquo big mouth rdquo motif click on the family portrait so Pink will meet the lady of the house and her dinner guests
She greets Pink very rudely and pays ldquo the commoner rdquo to go away Well hellip Good
Now we can deal with that butler
Back up
Clicking on Pink Panther allows us to access the coins the book of knowledge is available here too which we can now give to the butler So here rsquo s the bathroom
In the medicine cabinet there are ldquo smile supporters rdquo Pink relieves himself so we presume but says he rsquo s having trouble in there with us ldquo listening rdquo Hope for your sake that this is a short game Pink Okay lets go back down and try the right room
What a crazy bunch of guys
The first fella is sharing champagne but its much too early for the kitty
The guy by the window wants to give him a good home Wow
Success already
And the Man of the house wants to show off his new dentures
He drops a hairpin while demonstrating their indestructible nature
Alrighty then
I guess we know what to do with that Hairpin into lock and Back in the young master rsquo s bedroom Pink gets to hear the same story over again
When you are done listening to the lil darlings out the window you go Pink Panther lands by an ugly old stump
Hhmm looks like Witch Itah rsquo s hut but lets find out who rsquo s home in this one
Not far wrong its Wizard Strangeblood going out for his evening stroll
Now to find the cure for the little girl and meet the wizard rsquo s pet spot err Spot
Whoops
Click the book
The wizard is back early but we must have made a good impression because Spot arranges a fast exit
Welcome to extreme pinkness and a choice of directions
The little girl wished to be an immortal magic princess mermaid ninja
Spot reads the book to us amp gives options for travel
There rsquo s a frozen saber tooth tiger the Dead Sea water with a headstone and a link to the spot below the mansion outside the wizard rsquo s hut Mermaid clueTo make an immortal mermaid you rsquo ll need to find me
The only thing living in the saltiest seaPrincess clueTo make a magic princess you rsquo ll need a princely laugh
Specifically the biggest one that has a chilly pastFor the ninja bit we rsquo re on our own
Spot says ldquo improvise rdquo Gee thanks PLet rsquo s go to the Ice AgeSiberiaPink lands on the side of a frozen pond across from a colorful caveman
Ahh its Syberia err
I mean Siberia
A missing page from Pink rsquo s book of knowledge flows back into the tome
I suppose this is a reminder that you can read up on Siberia in your handy dandy Book of Knowledge
In the middle of the lake there rsquo s a mammoth that has fallen in the pond
Pink comments that the mammoth is certainly old enough and big enough to supply requirements but how is he going to rescue him
A reindeer volunteers a pouch of milk and dashes off again when you ask for his help with the mammoth
Interesting
Oh it rsquo s not a caveman but a sad clown who was fired because his smile wasn rsquo t big enough
Hand him those smile supporters and watch him grin away
Great
We rsquo ve made one person happy today You can exit on the left side of the lake to a hut village
An elderly woman would like her reindeer back
We rsquo ve met him but he rsquo s uncooperative
Now how to get him here
Keep clicking on the elderly lady to get hints Inside the left tent is a violent youngster with a fresh quest for us
Fix a handmade satellite dish and or find her some candy
You know I think I rsquo ve met this kid somewhere
You can snag a pot of water before you leave And now you can snag her satellite as well
I don rsquo t know about you but I feel guilty Let us see where we can put the satellite
From the comments it seems that higher is better
Try the tents and realize that the hut on poles must be the place
Uh oh
There rsquo s a bear up there
How to deal with him There rsquo s a pile of snow between the two tents
Click on it and Pink Panther will jump into it
ldquo Snow panther rdquo He cries
Now use the pot of water on it and make an ice sculpture panther
Not sure what good that is but we have one Remember that pouch of reindeer milk
You can warm it over the stove in the skin hut
Then toss it up to the bear and watch him go to sleep
You sculpture looks like an aerial amp that rsquo s what it is
You put it up amp put the satellite on it
The kid is now happy or at least pacified
He she has Blarney
barf Now that the little one is occupied check out the machines in the corner
Pick up the exercise videotape Well that appears to be all we can do here right now
So lets call Spot by clicking on the spot in inventory and then clicking on the environment
This takes us back to the pink warp zone
On to the Dead Sea
Note you can access Spot on most screens and when you come back to that area you will appear on the same screen you left from
Kinda cool
Dead Sea IsraelAha
The guy is floating on the water because of all the salt in it
Happily another big chunk of the stuff lies nearby
Pick it up
Also be sure to get the small tweezers lying on the beach blanket
Our friend on the water isn rsquo t very helpful so lets read the Book of Knowledge to find out that the only creatures in the saltiestsea are specially adapted microorganisms
You can also speak to the ostrich that is stuck on the other side of the salt lake and would like to walk home There rsquo s a dark cave in the middle of the rocks on the left and there appears to be something in it toward the end but we need a light
Pink apparently does NOT have cat rsquo s eyes The different colored mud you can click on the far right of the beach will give you a talkative bug who tells you that he a special algae is the only living thing in the dead sea
But when you try to get him the guy in the lake demands the tweezers back He needs them to pop his pustules eww
You give them back to him and he tosses the tweezers back to the blanket
Just pick them back up and try not to think too hard about it SiberiaUsing Spot we return to Siberia and present the salt lick to a VERY happy reindeer
The mammoth will have to work very hard to give us a bigger smile than that but apparently it isn rsquo t the ingredient we need
So take the salt lick back from the reindeer and give it to his owner
Her problem is now solved and you got aglowing talking guilt filled meteorite shard for your trouble
Cool Speaking to the elderly villager again we hear that toenail clippings are believed to be useful for casting an evil spell
Pink notes that they also look aerodynamic and snags an extra large clipping off the ground When you go back to the lake you will see that the earth tremor you felt while talking to he old woman has dislodged the mammoth most of the way up
One more should free him says Pink
Now how to do that At the lake use the toenail clipping on the icicles to make a stairway
You rsquo re in the dark again
You rsquo ll have a few questions to answer but they rsquo ll let you in eventually
What creature spread the Black Plague
Fleas were responsible
Which can a rat not do
Grow old
Which year was the ldquo year of the rat rdquo all three years given Inside the rat bar The rats tell you they were affected by nuclear underground testing
The biggest one lumbers off as soon as you click him
If you talk to the bartender he will give you a riddle the answer is rat
Your prize is a song about rats and a ldquo ratwurst sandwich rdquo I don rsquo t want to know
The big rat wanders back in ldquo sniffing for food rdquo and tacks up a smaller rat to a rock
You can get the tack amp release said rat by clicking on it If you click on the yellow entrance the headed rat will tell you that is where the king lives
Pink says he needs to get an audience with him
Click on the red ldquo pole rdquo to find out it is a seesaw
You have a choice of three rats to jump on the other side
The high blue one is the best choice but you rsquo re still not getting up to the ledge Okay how about luring that big guy back where you need him
Tack the sandwich onto the other side of the seesaw and get back on it
Whee
You rsquo ve arrived
The Rat King would be happy to give you your earthquake but he needs something to motivate the other rats into exercising with him
Give him the tape and now everyone is happy Back out at the lake the mammoth is now on the surface
His nose is free of ice
This is all you can do here for now Dead SeaBack again with Spot
Use the meteorite on a clickable location in the dark cave and you will see a youngster with a spot welder blowtorch Doesn rsquo t every kid have one
who says he she is trying to get a ldquo very small object rdquo on the wall
There rsquo s a page for Pink rsquo s book as well
You can check the debris on the floor but you can rsquo t have anything
If you give the youngster the tweezers you will receive the weldingglasses in return
Take these to Eli the guy on the water
He rsquo s happy AND he can rsquo t see
Good When you get back inside the cave kiddo will have gotten whatever it was
He she dashes off leaving you the tweezer again
Take them and go after the fungus again which looks remarkably like a beetle As soon as you collect the little guy Strangeblood appears and dries up the lake
Click the ostrich and she rsquo ll come over and give you an egg and an lsquo educational rsquo song before heading home
Hit the escape key if you tire of it early SiberiaWarp back to the lake
Stick the ostrich egg in the mammoth rsquo s trunk and he will break free on his own
Cross the lake on the ice floes and get him
The grateful clown will solve the rest of your immediate problems for you
No it doesn rsquo t make sense Back to the MansionYou click on the rope to go back up to the house You can go back earlier if you wish
Put the bug in the pot for the immortal mermaid part
Choose the mammoth and click on the boy to get your mammoth laughed Downstairs on the right hand side the dinner party has gathered
You can talk to the guests for fun but be sure to get the black belt from the unconscious guest in the bottom of the screen He rsquo s wearing stars
If you come back early you can get amusing comments for various inventory items You got your black belt
That ought to do for a ninja
Go add it to the pot Now its movie time Okay hellip so now we have a poisoned sleeping immortal mermaid magic princess ninja named Violet
And a very puzzled mammoth The next challenge The cure for our poisoned princess is said to be ldquo the carrier of the human soul amp the redhead rsquo s woeful plea rdquo If you go back downstairs you will find the dinner party finally tucking in Each guest will offer more silly commentary
You can get a very stale hard cookie from the pile of desserts behind the table
Nobody there is fool enough to eat it however
You can also snag the Greek salad platter and its lid
Its very shiny
You can see yourself in it That rsquo s all you can do at the mansion for now
Call spot at any location that appeals to you and see that two new locations are now available
These are represented by a giraffe Kenya and what looks like a Las Vegas line dancer Indonesia Clicking on the woman lands you on a boat with three ldquo Boogies rdquo on it who brief you on piracy in their part of the world
They claim to be descendents of ferocious ones Boogie men groan
A page for your book may appear here
You can also have the burlap sack on the mast but not the shark fins
They say those sell for much money and if they get really desperate for food they may eat them
Their cooking pot is empty
They really could use some food You can dive down into the water
There is a shark here who offers a poem to express his displeasure at having been de finned
Pink promises to help
A very poisonous sea snake introduces himself as well
You can bag him
Clicking on the coral rouses a moray eel who looks very hungry
You give him your cookie and he grouses at the loss of his tooth which you pocket
Sorry Charlie Okay go back up and then click down once
You can click on the boat which will give you a few barnacles
If you ask the shark about them he tells you these can be made into a tasty stew for humans
Pink feeds the the folk on the boat and gets the fins
When he returns them to the shark Strangeblood appears n the background and the shark is magically restored
Cool The grateful shark says he will help Pink get around
So get to the top and click on either island to get a ride to it
Mr Shark will take you there
If you click on the right island first you rsquo ll land on the beach of a jungle island which Mr Shark claims is the ldquo jungles of Borneo rdquo You can now go left or click on the otherisland Going left you meet an orangutan and a tiny tarsier who seem to be here to make sure you get at least some educational value out of this game lt g gt After the orangutan leaves you can click on the light brown spot on the tree to your left
Pink says he rsquo d like to free the birds that are stuck inside Click the two tiny ldquo flowers rdquo hanging crescent shapes on a stick in middle of the screen
Four villagers pop up who tell you that the birds inside are afraid to come out because they have not seen the father rsquo s hornbill inside the nest
The villagers have been feeding them but that rsquo s all they can do
They also say this hornbill is ldquo thecarrier of the human soul rdquo Okay now you know what you are looking for a hornbill or a hornbill rsquo s bill
One warrior is very hungry Going right Back at the beach where you landed results in the shark taking you to Dragon Island
So go in from the beach there and meet a very worried warthog
He says the dragons are coming and they are hungry
Pink is not initially impressed but when he checks the sign click on it a Komodo dragon shows up
It threatens to eat Mr Warthog Pink will climb back up the tree automatically and a slow song about Komodo dragons begins as before hit escape when you get tired of it
When it ends Pink will still be up the tree
Linda the Komodo dragon definitely wants to eat Mr Warthog
Clicking on the sign and Linda got me more info about Komodo dragons but didn rsquo t really change anything
Pink can however leave anytime
Linda thinks he rsquo s a tourist
You can also get a page for your book on this screen As soon as you drop the snake IN the sack on on the dragon she leaves
The grateful warthog gives you a ham sandwich for your trouble
Don rsquo t think too hard about that one You can go back to the other island now and feed the hungry guy
He rsquo ll tell you in return that you can call hornbills to you with fruit
At least he did the first time when I had rescued the birds ad the others had left
I went back to the beach before calling Spot KenyaPink arrives next to a tourist group about to take a hot air balloon ride over the Masai Mara Reserve and hears the end of the Park Rangers speech about it but the lever breaks right after the party enters the balloon
Pink is asked to find the it or something that will work in place of it To the left Pink finds quite an assortment of safari type creatures and a bird rsquo s beak on the ground
You can talk to pretty much all of the creatures but this was mostly good for edutainment info and a few minor giggles
Shake the tree for a fruit and go further left to the Masai villageIf you talk to the elder you will hear a speech about how the Masai have survived bad events in the th C You will also get a highly repetitive song about the first Masai ldquo a man called Masinta rdquo which documents how God supposedly told him a to build a corral and he rsquo d be given cows
This song has less than usual to do with the story The short guy on the left with his head painted in red ochre has just been declared a man
He will be able to marry soon he says The red haired warrior leaning on his staff has a problem
He needs to feed and water his cattle but he needs to celebrate a his new baby rsquo s birth with a bovine feast or at least some part of it and his cattle aren't fit for such a feast
Pink says he rsquo ll keep his eyes open for some beef or beef hellip parts
If you click on the nearest hut door a Masai woman officially welcomes you to the Masai village Back to Borneo the shark will take you back over from Dragon Island and into the jungle
Use the hornbill beak on the nest
Give the tooth to the warrior who wants something sharp
The natives leave except for the th guy if you havent fed him yet
Give the fruit to the remaining hornbill
Okay you rsquo ve got half of the ingredients and a big gold
round thing Back to KenyaGive the ring to the ranger and he will give you a beribboned bottle in return Warp back to the mansionGo back to the dining room and trade Flip the drunk guy furthest left for the liver he didn rsquo t want Take the liver to the Masai and the short fella will teach you a Masai proverb to cheer the young lady a plea
This game has no subtitles but it sounded something like ldquo O lappa
O weebore enkara rdquo trans ldquo Children are the bright moon rdquo You don rsquo t need to worry about learning it
The plea is a cloud object which Pink simply picks up We have the ingredients to help the little girl now so back to the mansion we go Adding them to the pot wasn rsquo t enough it seems even with the hornbill dancing so Pink Panther adds some veggies from the covered platter
Eewww hellip
Violet was prettier before
Be sure to pick up the platter again Looks like we still have some work to do
Speaking of ickies you can check the bathroom for a bit ofadditional humor Down in the Dining room the guests are finally getting to the part they came to see the unveiling of the ldquo star rsquo s bite collection rdquo ick Violet turns up and announces he she is Echidna an evil spirit possessing Violet who was drawn in by someone tampering with a mysterious spell
To break the spell and depart from Violet Echidna must have the help of ldquo the most powerful man in the world rdquo which one of the guests says must be Zeus
Reward her helpfulness by swiping the perfume and a small mirror from her pink purse on the table
Pink Panther now knows his next goal is Mount Olympus
Also swipe the camera from the back of another guest rsquo s chair before you leave Last challengeWhen you call Spot after this scene you will only be able to choose between Mount Olympus and the mansion Upon arriving Pink is delighted to find his last page
His book is fixed
Yay
He queries the local deities about speaking to Zeus and hears that its not easy to arrange
After clicking on Ares and hearing about ldquo the family quarrel rdquo Poseidon appears and asks if anyone knows where Echidna has gone
The others say Athena would know but Zeus has swallowed her whole
Poseidon storms off leaving his trident which Pink Panther pockets
Click Pegasus to hear a song about him ldquo When horses fllyyy hellip rdquo You can ask the minor deities about contacting Zeus again if you want but they aren't very helpful
Give Aphrodite the perfume and she rsquo ll call Zeus for you
Use the trident to rescue Athena from Zeus rsquo head as ldquo the pink god of headaches rdquo Athena once freed declares herself to be innocent of Echidna rsquo s abduction Pink tries to explain and is informed he must defeat the two gorgons and bring proof to keep his life but spill no blood
Zeus gives Pink use of Pegasus for the trial Once near the gorgons choose the salad and offer it to them
The first sister will turn to stone when she sees herself in the platter
The second will happily chomp the salad until Pink gives her the compact mirror
Then take a picture and return to Zeus
You rsquo re not out of the woods yet
Poseidon challenges you to a mythology trivia quiz the only bit you might have needed to read the book thoroughly to win but even if you lose you still have the opportunity to prove you didn rsquo t willfully make off with Echidna
The questions are What did Medusa rsquo s hair become snakes Which gift did Athena give to be declared the patron of Athens tree What gift did Poseidon offer a salty spring Who fathered many of the other Gods
Zeus Which of these disguises did Zeus not use to woo new women the sandwichPoseidon goes back with you to the mansion and the rest is a movie
Enjoy
GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
PLEURGHBURG Dark Ages WALKTHROUGH th February Len Green lengreen hotmail com GENERAL NOTES
A This walkthrough has been written for the new second version of the game V It should however be applicable also to the previous original version V N B Saves made on V cannot be used on V and vice versa
B There is one excellent ending two 'reasonable' endings and one 'bad' ending all very different and finishing with considerably different point scores All four endings are dealt with in this walkthrough The game branches near the middle see below and gives the possibility of two very different paths which rejoin later This walkthrough deals with both of these routes
C At the end of each action or series of actions I have included in curly brackets MY point score By subtracting from the previous score it is easy to see how many points were achieved for each such action s My final score is most probably a few points less than the absolute maximum possible since I've more than likely missed out on some non essential but point scoring actions amp or paths However in general I don't think that the score is to be taken TOO seriously but simply as an indication of vital progress since essential actions and maybe also some arbitrary ones are always scored
D As with all Quest Adventure games grab everything which is not nailed down Look at manipulate amp interact with everything possible including all items in inventory Combine suitable items inside inventory wherever appropriate Talk to everybody you meet and carry on until you exhaust all conversational possibilities but take care sometimes an inappropriate dialog choice can cause a blockage of further topics with subsequent loss of points
etc
E Save as often as possible You are frequently in dangerous situations amp or those in which you can get killed Also there are MANY different paths you can take and you may wish to backtrack to try out a previous option There are only save slots but you can overwrite them when they are full It is easy to save previous batches of saves you can zip them to reasonable sizes for more permanent saving if you so wish
F For some action sequences it's worth while maybe even essential to reduce walking speed in the options window to minimum then returning to 'normal' afterwards
G Occasional scenes are VERY dark generally in the 'evenings' Many players will have to turn up their monitor brightness maybe even to maximum for such scenes
H Some computers amp or monitors may have trouble with the quot Fog quot effect If so simply switch it off in the options window
I There are quite a few pretty gruesome 'pictures'
Some are amplified even more in closeups which if you are squeamish you can eliminate by turning off quot Extra Gore quot in the options window
J Sometimes you just walk out of a location and you are 'on the map' However whenever Jake's car is present you MUST use the key ring on the vehicle in order to access the map
K Sometimes this walkthrough will tell you to perform an action e g
combining items in inventory before you absolutely need to do so occasionally WELL before You can either do what is suggested or leave it until some later time when you are obliged to do so
L If you're stuck look at the quot Hints amp Tips quot in the game's manual Also you frequently have to go to the PDA amp talk to your boss in order to progress From time to time it is wise to go to Jake's home amp switch on the computer there is sometimes essential incoming email and occasionally you may have to search for details on a name you have obtained previously

a Adjust monitor gamma setting or brightness amp contrast so that the rock s behind which the baddie is hiding can be seen clearly I also found it helpful to play this part of the game in near darkness
b Although I managed to succeed at maximum speed it is helpful to set the speed in options window to minimum c I did not jump to the side of the screen at all d As soon as you get control identify the cleft between the rocks where the baddie's HEAD appears not a little to the left of this where the gunshot flashes appear e As soon as you get control VERY QUICKLY move the cross hairs onto this spot and fire off or shots at the guy's head as fast as you can f Do not move the cross hairs i e

DAY THREEAugust A D Darkness falls on Day Two and you begin the next day facing the room with the small pool in Popidius' house Walk forward to the three people standing the doorway across the room Popidius wants you to check out what Fructus is up to with the end is coming sign on the donkey in the street Go left but keep moving forward quickly when someone yells at you to stop If you aren't quick enough you'll be crowned by a roof tile and the game will be over If you are successful you will reappear in the perfume shop Ascula gives you a RED ROSE in appreciation for markedly increasing her perfume business
Outside the shop turn right to see two men
Speak with the man in the red trimmed robes on the right Aedile Helvius wants you to prove you didn't personally paint the the end is coming sign for Fructus
Turn left and speak with Ascula again She will tell Helvius she'll act in your defence Turn around and speak with the painter Fructus is definitely the culprit
There's no doubt about it Turn left and speak with the mule's owner again Helvius believes Fructus is your accomplice Marcus arrives in the nick of time and intercedes with Helvius on your behalf Then Marcus takes you off to the Palestra to practice some javelin tossing Marcus tells you that he believes Helvius who was Secundus rival in the recent election might be behind the graffiti incident with the prostitutes
In the Palestra walk over to the right and down the right side of the pool to pick up the javelin which is standing upright in the grass Throw the javelin forward away toward the wall It will land safely in the ground Don't offer the javelin to Marcus or you will end up killing someone and you know by now what that means Do a few practice tosses just for fun Then when the javelin is stuck in the ground take the roses Ascula gave you from inventory and click them on the javelin
Throw the javelin listen to Marcus toward the crater of Mount Vesuvius which you will see over the wall opposite where Marcus is standing
You see a cutscene where the rose entwined javelin lands periously close to Sophia who is strolling in Octavius' garden Afterward turn right go forward turn left and leave the Palestra
Walk forward to the left where you hear a voice calling you Turn back toward the amphitheater to see Locusta hiding under the stairway Talk to her about everything She gives you the TWO PHILTERS One is to convince Sophia to leave with you which you must use while you are alone with her The other is to render someone unconscious should they come between you and Sophia
Locusta will ask you to rescue Fructus who has been taken into custody She is afraid that Helvius will beat Fructus when he arrives to investigate
After you finish speaking with Locusta proceed forward around the perimeter of the amphitheater Two clicks forward you will encounter guard who is holding Fructus
Talk to him Don't tell him you are the Gallic magus magician Answer No
If you answer in the affirmative he will start yelling for help and the game's over When you are finished with the discussion concerning Fructus go forward to the iron gated doorway and speak to Fructus who is strung up in the passageway between two gates
Answer No to speaking to the guard on his behalf and after telling him to be silent go outside Don't talk to Fructus' guard again or he will tie you up and give you a time out too
From outside standing near the guard turn right and go around the perimeter of the amphitheater back toward where you met with Locusta On the fourth click forward you will come across a young man and Palmyre the prostitute Speak to Palmyre She will distract the aedile guarding Fructus for you She leaves Now talk to the young gladiator Pyrame It doesn't matter if you are unable to complete all conversation options with either Palmyre or Pyrame
The result will be the same

Go forward once
Turn right to see poor Fructus still strung up and miserable Don't talk to Fructus or the game will be over
You will be discovered by the guard And don't click on the square rock sticking out of the wall to the left or you will cause a disturbance and will be arrested
Instead use your knife to cut Fructus free He and Pyrame will follow you Quickly go back out across the arena turn left and go outside Immediately turn right and use those right side stairs to descend to the plaza again

Look down at Sophia's feet and note the hot spot Take the Tali dice from your inventory and throw them at Sophia's feet Sophia will ask you why you must leave in such a hurry Ah you are alone with Sophia right Maybe its time for magic philtre Take it out of your inventory and place it on the water in the fountain to your right You will see a brief vision of the coming disaster in Pompei Sophia promises to meet you by the garden gate the following nite after the feast of Vulcanalia That is if she gets Lavinia's consent

Short Review The first adventure game in years since The Last Express that is really a non linear adventure game
The order of your action and the conversation path you choose will determine the way Gus solved the case
There is no dead end at all within this game
Each problem will have at least two ways to solve it
Do not worry if suddenly an inventory item that you thought will help you solving a problem disappeared after doing an act
You will be able to find different way to solve that problem
This is a brilliant approach on solving a puzzle
Hopefully more developers will do the same thing for their future adventure games
There is one very tough Pixel Hunting puzzle in the game
You need to have patience to solve this one since a walkthrough is not good enough to solve it
Beside that tough puzzle all the puzzles in the game are easy or moderate
The graphics in the game are a top notch graphic even though is not as good as Syberia the previous game from Microids
There is only one bugs of the game that I encountered when I played this game
The voice of the characters overlapped each other during the conversation
I don't know if I could considered this as a bug though since it only applied to gamer that play this game on a laptop specially on any Dell laptop
You need to set your graphic bit into bit and TURN OFF all other applications on the background such as screen saver or any other program
Sometime you still have to restart the laptop even though you have done all the things mentioned above
Overall this is an A rated adventure game that will stick on the back of your mind for a long time
Introduction You play as Gus Mc Pherson a American Private Investigator who has been living in Paris as an artist
Sophia Blake asked him to investigate the murder of Ruby and Regis Whyte a mysterious American couple who were found dead in their hotel room at Hotel Orphee
As usual I will give freedom to you to choose your path since I only tell you the solution based on the question not by step by step walkthrough
Even though I try to place these questions in certain order so that you could understand how the story unfold
All important clues needed for a perfect ending will be marked withgreencolor
You need to collect or at least know about this clue to be able to provide a complete evidence to Inspector LeBreun for the final conversation with him
This will determine how the ending will be
Walkthrough Q What should he do with Sophia's request A He could either accept the offer at his studio right now or at the Chez Alexandre restaurant later on
No matter what he does he will accept the offer in the end
The only different is that he will have access to the restaurant earlier
In any case he will learn that Inspector Le Breun is the person in charge of the case and will gain access to the Police Station
Call Pinkerton agency his former New York office after she walked out of the door to do background check
The result will come later on
Make sure you check the door mat every time he enter his studio
Q What kind of information could Gus collect at Hotel Orphee A Not much at this time
Depends on which character you choose to tell Petit the front desk Gus could have an early access to the second floor
He could immediately talk his way to the second floor as an Insurance Agent or he has to squeeze his brain to sneak to the second floor as other professions

Water will produce Earth will produce Air will produce and Fire will produce
Get the scroll on the alchemy table
Notice these four lines from the scroll From the brimstone that is in the house of MarsFrom the lapis lazuli that is in the house of JupiterFrom the green coral that is in the house of VenusFrom the mandrake root that is in the house of Saturn From the brimstone that is in the house of MarsFrom the lapis lazuli that is in the house of JupiterFrom the green coral that is in the house of VenusFrom the mandrake root that is in the house of Saturn Remember the four diamond shape lock
On each lock there is a symbol associate with it
Those symbol are the symbol of Mars Jupiter Venus and Saturn

Walkthrough by KD K Daleng Reproduction in any form without express permission from the author is prohibited Note from author v Changed from v Copyright note fixed small misspelling errors
Changed from v Small note about key to Eaton rsquo s Safe
Changed from v Author rsquo s note additions to notes in case player uses another way solving the game than the WT does
The walkthrough is only doing what is necessary to solve the game in one way
There are several choices to do in many of the puzzles so one can solve a problem in a completely different manner than described in this walkthrough
Because of this try to use this walkthrough only when you are completely stuck as there rsquo s much more things to do and explore than is described here
Also when the WT tells you to talk to a character it means you should exhaust ALL topics available unless stated otherwise
But that doesn rsquo t mean you can just click something without thinking about what you are saying to a character because if you choose one topic another way of formulating a question that might have been more helpful disappears
So try think about what you are saying before actually saying it
Different responses may lead to a different result than the WT describes either for better or for worse
Just to have you warned
Just remember that whatever door closes for you there rsquo s always another opening up so you can rsquo t go into a dead end
But it can make any Walkthrough misleading if you take another approach
However I will make notes of the most common ones as I get reports of them
So even if the Walkthrough is tested you might do something different and end up with a different result than I am describing
I have tried to take this into consideration but the games uses many many different solutions to problems so all cannot be covered unless I get reports from you so if something in the walkthrough doesn rsquo t work for you send me a mail atkd thedarklight net You can also mail me if you can rsquo t solve a problem even with the walkthrough
My mailbox is a busy one but I answer everyone it just might take a little while
I rsquo m not talking about days but just take it into consideration
That rsquo s enough ranting from me let rsquo s move on to the game
Post Mortem Welcome to Post Mortem and Paris
We are about to take a journey through this excellent and intriguing story as Gustave McPhearson Former P I and which now is spending his days painting in your typical dusty painter studio in the middle of city of Paris
Let rsquo s begin shall we
We rsquo re just doing our usual painting when this gorgeous young woman strands on our front step
So what do we do about that
After some hellip ehm enjoying of the view we get control over the mouth hellip and eyes and invite her in
Seems like she has a need for us so If you feel like a gentleman you take the assignment right now and get started
Else you have to call her and meet her at a restaurant Yeah yeah might be an excuse for getting another look at her but we got a game to play and a mystery to solve so get your act together
Right the girl rsquo s sister and her husband has been brutally killed and she wants us to find the killer
First you do when you get control is getting the sketchbook on the kitchen counter At least that is what I think it is and the camera in the closet
Leave for the Orphee Hotel
Talk to the receptionist Petit
Depending on your response here Petit will either be cooperative and talk about what happened at the hotel that night hellip or he tells you to bug off
Telling him you rsquo re a P I seems to leave him less cooperative so try using something else
After you rsquo re done turn around go into the bar and talk to the bartender
Also buy a bottle of Red from him Go back into the main hall and take the Paper on the bench
If you want you can also pick up the phone on the desk and send a telegram to learn more about Ms Blake Now our next destination is the police station so let rsquo s go there
On arrival you rsquo ll see a mother really concerned about her lost boy
We rsquo ll learn more about that later hehe Talk to the officer doesn rsquo t seem to matter what you tell him here seems to boil down to the same anyway
When done talk to him again and offer him the bottle of red and voila you just learned how to bribe French Policemen
Read the Police Report and a new location opens Dr Kaufner rsquo s office
But talk to the officer again about the report before going there
At Kaufner rsquo s office talk to the good doctor obviously
When done we rsquo ll go back to the Orphee and talk to the Bartender And Petit if you rsquo re in his good book Right you should get a description of the suspect now from the bartender and possibly Petit the receptionist so a profile maker appears in your sketchbook
Let rsquo s go there
All right you might not be good in this profile drawing thing so I rsquo ll give you helping hands
First one if you go into the directory your game is installed Default c Program Files Microids Post Mortem then Textures PortraitRobot
There you will find a pic as the profile should be when it rsquo s done
If you don rsquo t feel like turning off the game to look at the done drawing Alt Tab made the game crash on my machine you can follow this description of how it should be
I rsquo ll tell you how many times you need to click each part of the face left or right
The diagram below shows all the eight parts
If I have placed a number to the left of the buttons lines it means you press the left arrow as many times as the number says
Same goes for right
If I place a zero between the buttons it means you rsquo ll leave it alone
If you already played with the profile go out of the sketchbook and back in to get it to show default
When done with the pic write it out by pressing the pen icon below the picture field All right now when that rsquo s been taken care of talk to the receptionist and the bartender once more to get positive ID
Now try going up the stairs to the second floor Gus don rsquo t want to in fear of the almighty Petit
But that big ol rsquo Suitcase in the middle of the floor looks cool we rsquo ll take it for a test drive so climb into it
After a rather rough drive we find ourselves in the second floor
Try opening room and both locked
Go in the door across the hall from and you rsquo ll meet Mrs Louisau
If you don rsquo t go in her apartment she rsquo ll stop you when trying to go back down the stairs
Talk to the lady
When done go down again and talk to Petit
From the talk with the bartender earlier you should have learned that Malet is usually hanging at a placed called the Alambic Bistro which should have opened up on your map
So we rsquo ll go there then
Move towards the bar and you rsquo ll see a cut scene where Malet and the owner Hulot are playing cards
You rsquo ll automatically get into a conversation with Malet that will end up with Gus showing him the drawing of the suspect
When he does Malet flees and who just showed up in the Bistro
Guess we rsquo re in for a little jog
Gus will chase Hellouin but eventually loses him We rsquo re back at the studio and Berenice is on her way home Sure we had to threat ourselves something for losing Hellouin and fall that badly on the ground When dressed get back to the Alambic and talk to Hulot behind the bar
Ask for help in unlocking a door and he rsquo ll give you two paintings he wants you to look at
Exhaust all topics with Hulot and take a look at the paintings he just gave you
Now this is a typical ldquo Find errors rdquo type of Puzzle
One picture has mistakes compared to the original
Switch Paintings by using the button below the painting
The errors are On the fake one there rsquo s no man in the coffin as there is in the original just an empty coffin
On the original a man is about to get slayed in the top right corner
On the fake the man is not there
A little below that two bowls are missing from the roof of a little house hut or whatever
Just left of the Three Stub a bit above the mentioned roof a Pole is missing
Last error is a missing cross in the middle shield in the bottom right corner
That should be all after completed correctly talk to Hulot and tell him you rsquo re done
He rsquo ll give you a set of lock picking tools as reward
Head to the police station and tell the officer you have a portrait of the killer and he rsquo ll soon enough show you the way to Inspector Lebrun
Go in the first door to the left Quite easy to find it says Lebrun and talk to the good inspector
He should tell you where Hellouin lives among other things
When done just head on to Hellouins office which should have opened up on your map
The office is the second door in the hallway we are going to break in and have a look so examine the door handle and get your lock picking tools
Now the trick to doing this is following a very easy concept
Put four of your total five tools in each part of the lock
Top left top right middle and bottom Try turning the handle and look closely at the tools
If they are rattling like crazy in the lock it rsquo s the wrong tool in the wrong place of the lock but don rsquo t worry we rsquo ll just use the first try as kind of a calibration
If a tool shakes less than the others we rsquo re getting somewhere
That means it rsquo s the right tool for that specific part of the lock it rsquo s just slightly out of position
Hold the marker over that tool and click so that it changes position its three positions available for each part of the lock so you may have to click a max of whooping two times for it to be right
Try the handle again and if the tool is still it rsquo s in the right position
If not try changing its position one more time
Now do this for all parts of the lock following the same simple logic Shakes alot wrong tool amp wrong position Shakes a bit Right tool amp wrong position perfectly still Right tool amp Right position
When you rsquo re done you should be inside the rascal rsquo s office
Go behind his desk and open the top Drawer Bottom one is open but has a safe inside that you cannot open or pick Top drawer is just below the desk surface
Take one of the files in the drawer and you rsquo ll meet Mrs Hellouin once agai
Woman at Police station lost her little boy remember
Be nice to her say you want her son no harm and eventually she rsquo ll show you where he is
Go up the attic stairs and meet Hellouin
He will tell you his Story
You are now playing as Hellouin and are to investigate the Eatons
You know the story
Firstly go to the Eaton rsquo s apartment
You rsquo ll see the janitor scrubbing the floor at the entrance
Whatever you say to her she won rsquo t let you in so we rsquo ll have to think of something else
Turn left and go into the back yard
In the end of this backyard is a red ball
Take it and turn back to where you entered the backyard
There rsquo s a window pretty close that have a plant in it
Throw the ball at it
Damn good for nothing kids
Janitor goes to clean up the mess and you rsquo re free to move up the stairs
In the Eaton rsquo s apartment go into the first door on the right and open the closet
There rsquo s a safe in there but we don rsquo t have the key
So go out again and enter the next door
On the desk close to the door there rsquo s a boat ticket pick it up
Go back out and take a look at the poster on the living room wall
Alambic opens up on your map
Just left of this poster examine the desk and take a letter by Gracie Eaton and a calling card
Take a look at both
Since Kaufner rsquo s office should have opened up on your map by now we rsquo ll visit him now
Talk about everything you can and then we rsquo re on our way to the Alambic
We rsquo ll meet Berenice here so talk to her and you rsquo ll learn Hulot and the Eatons just left for a restaurant among other things
When done go to the Brotherhood meeting place and try entering the door and the doorman will stop you
Ask him about the favorite restaurant and that it is urgent and he rsquo ll tell you the restaurant is Chez Alexandre which opens up on your map
What you waiting for then
Go there right away son
Talk to the guy behind the counter and you rsquo ll learn a few interesting thins about the eatons and that they live at the Orphee Hotel
So that rsquo ll be our next destination
It rsquo s so refreshing being a P I you see so many places At the hotel talk to the ever so joyful Receptionist Petit and you rsquo ll twist him a little around your finger
After the conversation Malet will contact you and tell you to meet him in the bar
So go into the Bar sit down by the table close to the window and you rsquo ll see a cut scene of the night of the murder
Ok we rsquo re back being MacPherson
If you sent a telegram in the last segment there rsquo s a response to it at your doorstep now
Read it if you like
It rsquo s time to call Sophia Blake she lied to us and we want to know what rsquo s really going on here
You rsquo ll agree to meet at the Chez Alexandre
Go there and talk to the guy behind the counter
He rsquo ll show you to your table
Talk to Sophia
After some clearing things up you finally agree to see the case through
Head back to The Orphee and talk to both Receptionist and bartender
While at the reception pick up a pencil
If it rsquo s not there it rsquo s probably because you got an Iris pin from Mrs Louisau earlier they have the same purpose
Head to the second floor and enter room Gee its open now
Move to the door left of the fireplace it leads to room
Inspect the bottom of the door and put the paper below it as a scandal rag
Now use the pencil or Iris pin depending on what you got in the keyhole and push the key on the other side out so that it rsquo ll fall on the paper below the door
You rsquo ll get the key so all you need to do now is using it on the door
Move to the fireplace and by closer look you rsquo ll notice a gold ring
Pick it up Gus will comment that he doesn rsquo t know who Fay is but that rsquo s just because the game didn rsquo t expect us to get in here this late in the game I guess
Like I said earlier this game offers many solutions to things you can use the lock pick tools on room instead of Hellouin rsquo s office and get a hammer from near the broken elevator in the hotel and break into his office that way instead but this walkthrough take the less destructive way
Ok we got the ring now pick up some glass pieces from the floor and a key from the nightstand
You can also take a look at the sink and notice some black hair dye
Wasn rsquo t Fay rsquo s hair dyed red
Make your own conclusions Exit room and the Hotel and head out to The Eaton apartment
NOTE If you use lock picks on Room instead of Hellouin rsquo s office the key to the Eaton rsquo s safe will not be on the nightstand but behind a poster in the Eaton apartment Once there go into the first room to the right and unlock the safe with the key you just got from
There are some passports and documents in there
Take and read them all
If you are the jumpy type you can save your game now head over to Kaufner rsquo s office
Once there the map gets unavailable but don rsquo t worry
It looks like scare tactics as I rsquo ve played through the game three times and never ended up in one of those polstered cells hehe
Go one step forward and then head left
Walk until you see a small hallway branching out from the main hallway
Go in there and pull the lever in the wall
Door behind you closes while the one in front of you opens
Continue to the next branch and throw the next lever and continue to do so until you rsquo re all the way around and back where you started
One of the doors in the middle hallway is now open so head down that way
At the end turn left and throw levers again till you once again end up at the starting point
Both doors in the middle hallway should now be open meaning you can enter the wooden door at the end Kaufner rsquo s office
Enter it
First thing we do once into the office is getting four crystals all in different colors
Three of them are in each their bookshelf so look around at each bookshelf until you get a magnifying glass and pick up the crystal
Last crystal is on the table in the corner among a necklace
Grab both
Move towards the front of the desk and pick up Dr Kaufner rsquo s personal journal
Read it while you rsquo re at it
Then open the golden egg and take the wax cylinder inside it
Now go to the other side of the desk and open the drawer
Take the journals of Gracie Eaton and De Allepin and read them both
We should be done here so go back to the Orphee and up to Mrs Louisau
Left of her is a Phonograph
Put the wax cylinder in it and throw the handle on the side to play it
After you have listened it through move over to the Alambic and talk to Bebe When all topics are exhausted with Bebe we head on to De Allepin rsquo s house
Use the four crystals you found on Kaufner rsquo s office on the door and you rsquo ll be able to enter
Just inside take a look above the doors on each sides there rsquo s some symbols there and the illustrations surrounding them is supposed to show the element the symbol represent
We rsquo ll use this info later
Head upstairs and look above the two doors here as well
Then move over to three glass paintings on the wall and note the dates and year on them thJan
thJun
and thMar
more info we rsquo re going to have a use for later
Move into De Allepin rsquo s office there rsquo s not much of interest in his bedroom
At the desk there are some documents about De Allepin rsquo s financial situation and a box of matches
Take both and read the document
Gus comments that the handwriting on the document is different from the one Hellouin supposedly received from De Allepin
Next go to the other end of the room
There rsquo s a stellar puzzle here but we rsquo ll wait a couple minutes with that
Instead take a metal ring in the bookshelf right of the puzzle
Just so we don rsquo t forget it later
We rsquo re done here for now head over to the Brotherhood meeting place and try to enter
Doorman stops you
He really has that jumping in front of your face thing doesn rsquo t he hellip
Talk to him but no matter what you say he won rsquo t let you in
Go to the alembic and talk to Bebe again
Ask her to forge a letter based on the documents you have
You can ask her make a forge the letter too but it won rsquo t get you in Leave alembic and enter it again
Bebe is now finished with your letter
Take it say Thank you and head back to The Brotherhood where you show the fake letter to the doorman
If all goes well he rsquo ll let you in
Move through the door into a church kind of room go towards the ldquo Throne rdquo and go into the door just left of it
You should be in a Meeting Library Museum kind of room
The only thing really important for us if you following this walkthrough is a coin in one of the display cases but you can also grab a couple of books about the templars and solar systems Illustrated and all if you like
When done exploring head back to De Allepin rsquo s house
When there head back to De Allepin rsquo s office and the Stellar Puzzle It rsquo s time for some Productive work
Now what you rsquo re supposed to do here is enter a correct date
The right one is one of the three dates found on the three paintings in the hall outside the room
The four wheels on top is the year the two in the middle is the month and the two on bottom is the day
With me it triggered at the date but it very well might be random so try them all out
When date is entered pull the lever and hopefully you rsquo ll see a small cut scene and a secret door opens
Needless to say that rsquo s the way we rsquo re going
You rsquo ll end up in a crypt
First thing to do is head right
There is an alchemy set on a bench here take a closer look at it as that is the first thing we rsquo re going to solve
You rsquo ll see a complete set with lots of bottles spoons and a vial
By the Vial is a coin grab that as well
Along the walls of this crypt there are four posters with numbers on them
Trick here is to see how much of each ingredience we need for our alchemy project
On each poster is also an illustration of what element we rsquo re talking about
These numbers are all ldquo Magic Cubes rdquo
That means whatever way you add these numbers together down sideways or diagonal the sum remains the same
Try it if you like
Write down the results you get and find out what element each poster belong
When you rsquo re all done head back to the alchemy set
Next you may notice is that nothing about this set is made easy as each bottle has a symbol instead of words
So we need to find out what bottle Earth Wind Fire and Water actually has
Remember the illustrations and symbols above the doors around the house
Those tells you what symbol belongs to what element
If you remember them or drew them down great
If not then Black bottle is earth Wind is Blue Water is Green and Fire is Red
Each spoon holds a certain amount of each ingredience which is displayed on the spoon itself
The amounts are and
You added together those numbers yet
Then you probably know you need of earth of Wind of Water and of Fire
You didn rsquo t get that
Guess Math isn rsquo t your best side then
Nah I rsquo m just kidding fill the spoons and throw the correct amount of each bottle into the vial
When all the ingredients and correct amount of each is in the vial use your matches to light up the gas just beneath the vial
If all is done correctly you should obtain a vial with a Purple Pink colored gas
So we rsquo re done here let rsquo s move on further into the crypt
There rsquo s a new Puzzle here but ignore that for now and move even further into the crypt
De Allepin Lies here on a bench dead
Go to the side of the bench and take a picture of the body
Its evidence I tell you P If you like you can study all the graves around here
It rsquo s all the persons De Allepin has been since year or something like that
When done studying head back to the puzzle we ignored earlier it rsquo s time to do our duty
First take the long bladed knife just right of the puzzle itself
It rsquo s the murder weapon
Examine the code wheel and put the missing ring you found in the bookshelf at De Allepin rsquo s office in it
Now all you have to do is push the four clams surrounding the rings in place and the puzzle activates
There rsquo s a book on your left side now showing an illustration of a solar system
Note that the ldquo planets rdquo with the letters A D N is marked
That means they rsquo re special of coarse
The top clam shows one letter on each ring so we rsquo ll do the smart thing and enter A D N From top ring and down by turning the wheels around
First part is complete now for the number wheels
Ignore the leftmost number wheel and leave it blank
Take another look at the illustration in the book
Notice the planets where the A D N combination is again
You rsquo ll see that from the middle the ldquo A rdquo is in the first solar ring ldquo D rdquo is in the third ring and ldquo N rdquo is on the fifth
Reverse that number and you rsquo ll get
Enter those in the bottom number wheel from the top and down
That should trigger another cut scene and move us to the next segment of the game
We rsquo re back at the Studio thinking about recent events when a note slips in through your door
Great Sophia is kidnapped and De Allepin Kaufner wants it back
Like we know where it is
Head over to The Alambic and talk to Bebe
You rsquo ll learn that Hulot is the fourth victim
Talk to Bebe and talk about everything especially about Hulot rsquo s Fresco and Bebe copying art for him
Gus will show her a drawing of the head of Baphomet which she recognizes
After finished talking head further into the Bistro until you see some candles and a picture of Hulot on a table
Pick up one of the candles
Move one step to the left and examine the painting on the wall
NOTE If the candle does not seem to light up you haven rsquo t discussed the head of Baphomet with Bebe
Look in your inventory if the sketch of it is present
You rsquo ll need that to advance Now this is a hard puzzle and the worst thing is that this walkthrough can do little to make it easier
If you don rsquo t like pixel hunting this is not for you
The goal here is to find segments of a drawing hidden in the painting
By moving the candle around you are supposed to reveal parts and letters of the drawing
When you find one Gus will automatically draw them down
A few Tips though
Move the candle slowly around as some parts only unveil themselves if the candle hovers above them for a certain time
Take your time and be thorough

One letter and one part of the drawing are hidden in the white parts in the bottom right so pay extra attention there

With me it sometimes helped by holding the left mouse button down
Might just be me but I found it easier that way
Other than that I can rsquo t do much else than wishing you good luck and even if you find all the letters and put them correctly so that the name of the place is showing you still need all the parts for it to show up on the map
Annoying yes but it keeps you busy for a few more minutes at least
Check your progress in the sketchbook and glue the pieces together as you discover new pieces of the puzzle
A Picture of the final drawing is also available in the same directory as the Profile Drawing mentioned earlier in the walkthrough
When finally done go to Hellouin rsquo s office and get the flashlight in the attic
Then head to the new Location on the map
The Molitor When at Molitor head straight forward then follow the leftmost railway
A cut scene of a train almost smashing you leads to that you rsquo re suddenly in a very dark room
That rsquo s why we got a flashlight
Turn it on and head further in and down the stairs
On a shelf is the head of Baphomet so take it
Then take a look in the box a bit left of the same shelf and you rsquo ll find hellip another head of Baphomet
So we got two of them but which one is which
You can try asking Bebe at the Alambic but even she can rsquo t tell them apart
Head to the Police station and talk to Lebrun
Present all the evidence that you got
If you have enough which you should have if you followed this walkthrough Hellouin should be sent in for questioning at the end of the conversation
Now we go to De Allepin rsquo s house for the Game Finale
There are three endings available here the outcome when you give the head to Kaufner Allepin depends on if you presented enough evidence to Lebrun or not
I won rsquo t say more than that
Congrats you just finished Post Mortem
Hope you had fun

For Questions or Comments on this Walkthrough Please write to MaGtRo Copyright MaGtRo GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
PROMINENCE Official Guided Walkthrough by the Prominence Development Team If you have any questions or feedback about this walkthrough please contact info prominencegame com Act One Medical Take a moment and look around
It rsquo s kind of dark in here
The main overhead lights seem to be out or at least turned off and smaller yellowish lights provide just enough visibility to getaround ndash and perhaps make things feel a little creepy hellip Judging by the icon on the control panel the windowed door to the left appears to be locked although you can try it anyway just to be sure
Walk along the Outer Medical hallway to the first corner
There rsquo s a computer screen to the right and attempting to interact with it confirms that it is unpowered
There rsquo s also an unusual looking machine here with a small control keypad
It doesn rsquo t appear to have power either While you rsquo re here you can turn around to get a good view of Inner Medical through the curved window
You can also turn and look up at the black hemisphere on the wall which appears to be some kind of Camera
When you rsquo re ready continue along the hallway toward the heavy looking door and the overturned cart
Along the way you can try the second windowed door if you like
You rsquo ll also experience a flash a bit of vertigo and subtle muffled voices
Or d j vu
Or is it memories
Or something else
Once at the end of the hallway try interacting with the solid looking door or its control panel
Since this door is stuck and the doors to Inner Medical are locked you rsquo ll have to find a way out
Look down at the floor near the overturned cart and pick up thekeycard left click
Was it on the cart when everything fell or did someone drop it
Was there a struggle or did someone just leave in an awful hurry
What happened here
Move to either of the doors that lead to Inner Medical
Now right click for the inventory screen
Or use the scrollwheel to change the cursor to the items in your inventory
Then left click to go back to the game
Use thekeycard left click on the door lock
The card will pulsate when you are in the correct spot
Then click on the door and enter Inner Medical
An objective will appear on your screen at this point if you have Auto Objectives selected in the Options screen
It rsquo s on by default but if you prefer a harder old school adventure experience this setting can be turned off
There rsquo s a pair of big computers in the corner next to the Medscanner bed
As you walk over to them you rsquo ll see astylussitting on one of them
Pick it up
Look down between the Medscanner bed and the servers and you rsquo ll find a service panel that can be opened up
Inside there rsquo s a switch and some kind ofbatterywith a harness attached
Turn on the switch and the Medscanner will power up
The door will close automatically when you back out of the zoom or you can close it manually by clicking on the open service panel door
If you look back at the servers they now have some animated displays
You tried the only door out of Medical and it rsquo s not working
Maybe you can get out through the air vent
Climb up onthe countertop and try to remove the air vent
No luck
Still it might be easier to find a way to get through this vent than to find a way through the heavy main door
Is that a faint sound of a fan coming from the vent
Go to the foot of the bed and you rsquo ll see that the Medscanner monitors are now on because of the switch that was activated
Zoom into the display and click the ldquo Calibrate rdquo button and you rsquo ll find that something must be very wrong with this Medscanner
The blast leaves a scorch mark on the floor
That could almost certainly burn through the vent couldn rsquo t it
Exit the Medscanner zoom
If you turn around and look through the large window you rsquo ll see that the terminal is now online
Leave Inner Medical and go into the corner with the Medical Archives system and the Holoprojector
Click on the Medical Archives screen and you rsquo ll be able to see and hear recent Medical reports
Hm
Zoom in on the Holoprojector
Click on the cover to open it and inside you rsquo ll see a curvedreflectorheld in place by a pair of clasps
Using the right click to access the inventory would be okay here but it rsquo ll be faster to use the mousewheel
Scroll it up or down until thestylusis selected then use it to pry one of the clasps on the left side and then repeat for the second clasp
Now you can take thereflector
Back out of the zoom you can close the cover separately if you wish and then go back into Inner Medical
Walk back around the bed and put thereflectoron the scorch mark
Head back to the Medscanner control panel and activate it to blast a hole in the vent
BLAM
Climb onto the counter and remove the vent
The noise from the duct gets louder
You can actually climb down and hear it in other nearby areas too if you rsquo d like
When you rsquo re ready head into the Air Duct
Air duct Crawl forward until you reach the bend in the duct
A narrow vertical shaft extends upward but it rsquo s too small to climb up
Pick up theprybar
Turn to face the spinning fan and use theprybaron the power cable on the left side of the fan
As the fan sparks and spins down you might notice that you still have control and can do what you like
We try hard in Prominence not to take control away from the player unless their character is actually impaired in some way
Pick up thewire
Click on the fan blade to zoom in on it
If you click and drag the fan blades you can rotate them until there rsquo s a gap at the bottom
Crawl through the gap and continue until you reach the end of the duct
Click to push down the grate
As it swings down you might notice a clang and what sounds like a piece of something breaking and rattling onto the floor
Move through the opening to drop into the Storage Room
L storage room Look at the grating of the vent you just came through and you rsquo ll notice a piece missing
Theshardis on the floor nearby
Pick it up
There are several boxes and containers in here but nothing else of note right now
Click on the door to leave
L hallway Now you rsquo re in a hallway and like the other areas it seems to be lit by small alternate fixtures rather than direct overhead lighting
Straight ahead the hallway leads to a door at the far end
Look left and you rsquo ll see two doors and a massive fire door that spans the entire hallway
Look to your immediate right there is a door as well
Head to the left hallway
As you move along the hallway you may notice something on the right
Turn and you rsquo ll see some status monitors with animated readouts and displays
Click on them
Sure enough it seems that there is a serious lack of power in this place right now
On the wall opposite the monitors there rsquo s a door with a red locked status light
You may also notice the metal duct running across the hallway
That rsquo s the duct you just crawled through so you can probably guess where the door with the green status light leads
Move to that door and toward the huge door
If you give the door with the green status a try you rsquo ll hear and see that it rsquo s jammed
Now you rsquo ve got aprybar though so go ahead and pry open the door
You rsquo ll be back in Medical but now that the door isn rsquo t stuck anymore you can come and go as you please
Head back into the hallway and click on the big door then walk back to the bend in the hallway
The door on the right leads back to the Storage Room
Go through the door that rsquo s straight ahead
Data archives dark There must be a power failure
The room is completely dark and you can rsquo t go any further without some kind of light
Turn around and head back out to the hallway
L hallway Turn right and follow the hallway to the door at the end
It won rsquo t open at first but you can use theprybarto open it up and move into the Elevator Shaft
Elevator shaft Look upward and you rsquo ll see that the elevator car is on the next floor up so the only direction to go is downward
Look downward and the shaft descends into blackness
It looks like there might be something of interest along the side wall a short way down
Move toward the ladder and climb down one level
Look to the right and move off the ladder
Look to the left and there will be a control panel on the wall with sliders
The top slider controls the lights above the middle slider controls the lights by the control panel and the bottom slider controls the lights below
For now turn off the top slider by moving it all the way to the left
Set the bottom and middle sliders each to the halfway point there rsquo s not enough power right now for full activation of any slider
You can back out of the zoom at any time to see the effects of the current panel settings
Head back to the ladder and climb down one more level to the bottom of the elevator shaft
Move toward the doors
Use theprybaragain to open them and move into the Service Corridor
Service corridor Explore the length of the corridor here and pick up thekeyat the far end
It rsquo s sitting on one of the cylinders
Since the other doors here are currently locked head to the green lit door near the elevator to enter Power Control
Power control Move down the steps and look to the right and you rsquo ll see a workbench and some kind of cabinet
Head over to it and pick up theB R card from the workbench then look in the box on the floor next to the workbench and take thestun baton
Like the drawers in Medical the cabinets here have biometric locks and you cannot open them
You rsquo ll have to make due with whatever you can find laying around
Walk around the room to the control panel next to the central power station
Open the panel at the bottom right of the station
If you turn the switch on and off nothing happens
Looks like the battery must be dead
Click on the big dead battery to remove it
Another flash and more voices
This time one voice definitely escapes the cacophony toward the end
Clearly something has happened or is happening to you
Wasn rsquo t there a battery in the Medscanner at the beginning
It wasn rsquo t the same size as the black one but maybe there rsquo s a way to rig it up
Leave Power Control turn right at the corridor and go back up the elevator shaft to the second level
With the slider settings that were used previously on the way down you should have no trouble getting back up and through the nd floor doors of the elevator shaft without having to make any additional adjustments
Head back up to the hallway outside of Medical
Along the way you can skip any of the movement transitions if you like by holding down lt CTRL gt when you click to move
There rsquo s also a setting in the Options screen to disable transitions altogether for adventure gamers who find the movement animations uncomfortable
Medical Go back to the Medscanner service panel where you saw the battery
Use thekeyon the lock and then take thebattery
Head back down to Power Control
Power control If you haven rsquo t already saved the game this is probably a good time to hit lt ESC gt to access the main menu and click ldquo Save Game rdquo
Click on an empty save slot and you rsquo ll be prompted to add a comment for the save file
Save files also include a screenshot of the current in game view along with a time date stamp
Go to the control console at the central power station
Open the panel where you pulled out the old battery
Place thebatteryfrom Medical on the left side of the compartment
Use thewireto finish rigging up the connections
If you turned the switch off you can now turn it back on and the console will turn on
Once you zoom out of that view the monitors on the station should be powered and working
Zoom in on the top row of monitors and click the button for ldquo Conduit Access rdquo
You can now remove the burned out power coil from the conduit
In order to close the circuit and restore power use theprybaron the conduit
BLAM
After the cinematic plays you rsquo ll see that the power is back on and the room is now being fully lit by the dynamos beneath the floor
There rsquo s a computerized voice coming over the PA system saying something about a technician needing to report to Central Computer Control
She certainly sounds a bit messed up
You can inspect the prybar and the console if you rsquo d like
Look toward the stairs that lead back to the Service Corridor
To the left of the staircase is a Local Communication Terminal LCT
You may have noticed it before
It rsquo s working now that the power is back on
You can walk over andinteract with the LCT to cycle through a mix of voicemail and email messages ndash including one from someone named Zemith who mentions working up in Central Computer Control
Maybe he rsquo s one of the technicians the PA system is talking about
Another one from Vryse mentions the prybar and that it fell down a narrow vertical duct under ANNIE
And hey wasn rsquo t there another LCT up in Medical
Maybe you can get some more information from that
And now you rsquo ve got a computer talking so there rsquo s got to be a way to find her somewhere Head back into the Service Corridor
Service corridor Now that you rsquo ve restored power the environment will look and act quite differently
You rsquo ll also hear the computerized voice intermittently deliver status reports over the PA system
She rsquo s got a lot to say and not much of it sounds like good news
If you move along this corridor and look around a bit you may also notice the machinery here will occasionally vent off coolant and cast sparks from the tops of the towers
Players will have a chance to learn about these machines and many other devices during the course of the game
The doors here still aren rsquo t opening
If you look closely at the controls or try using the keycard you rsquo ll find that none of them have keycard readers
Since the power is back on perhaps the elevator will work and you won rsquo t have to climb up and down the ladder any more
Then you could get to other floors as well
Why not give it a try
Elevator It works
If the climb down the elevator shaft and the parked elevator car are any indication then you rsquo ve probably already been on level but let rsquo s see if that rsquo s really the case
Plus it rsquo ll be a good chance to see if stuff in there has power now like the areas on Level
Click on the ldquo rdquo on the control panel to take the elevator to level and you rsquo ll go on a short ride
You might even notice that your cursor sinks briefly as the elevator starts then rises back up a bit as it comes to a halt
Click on the door to exit
L hallway Definitely brighter in here now that the main lighting fixtures are powered
Head toward Medical
As you head toward Medical you may notice that the monitors on the wall have changed
Feel free to inspect them before entering Medical
Medical As with the hallway it seems like power is on now
Check out the LCT messages
Head to the computer terminal in the corner
Read listen through the Medical Archives
Should we jot down any of those names and numbers
This is an adventure game after all
If you replace thereflector you can also use the holoprojector here
Head out of Medical and go back down the hallway and go into the dark room again
Maybe it will be lit now
Data archives dark Hmm
Still dark
It didn rsquo t have any lighting earlier either
Maybe something else happened here and power isn rsquo t getting through
For now turn around and head back into the hallway and return to the Elevator
Elevator Take the elevator up to Level
L hallway This area seems to have a different structural form than levels and
Turn right and go through the door
L storage Another flash will occur with more voices as you enter here and the voice at the end sounds considerably less comforting this time
Click on the handle of the bin on the lower shelf to slide it out then take theB R card
The holoprojector bulbs aren rsquo t needed right now
Click on the bin handle again to push it back and then exit the zoom or just exit the zoom and it will be pushed back automatically
Head back into the hallway
L hallway Continue up the hallway
Head past the intersection to the right turn and keep following the hallway
Try the door up on the right side and then take a close look at the door control
Looks like a keycard is needed
Try using the keycard from Medical
Try the fire door
Looks like there rsquo s no way through here yet
Head back to the intersection
Walk down the side corridor with the two doors on opposite walls
Head through the door on the left
Colony communications Explore
Check out the LCT messages
Pick up theURCfrom the console
If you activate the large holotable you rsquo ll see a view of the colony
But is this the proposed colony
Or is it the actual structures
Could you be in one of the buildings or are you elsewhere
Hm
Go back into the hallway and then through the door on the opposite wall
Security Each display here is wired up to a different system
One is for keycard encoding and management
That could be handy
Another one accesses the big video wall and camera systems although most of them seem to be offline
The last is some kind of environmental hazard detection system and seems to be reporting some troubling news
You can check out each of them and then when you rsquo re ready use the Keycard Management System
As the instructions on the screen say simply use the existingkeycardon the track to the right of the screen
Sure enough the keycard found in Medical is encoded for Dr Reitessa
According to the LCT messages down in Power Control Zemith and Vryse have both recently done work in Central Computer Control
There was no Medical report for Vryse but there was one for Zemith
Click the ldquo no rdquo symbol in lower right button on the keypad interface or use the BACKSPACE key on your keyboard to clear the current record numbers or click on the back arrow several times then click or type in and Zemith rsquo s record should appear
As with Dr Reitessa you can read about him if you like
When you rsquo re ready to encode his ID onto the keycard click the ldquo encode rdquo button on the interface then use thekeycardon the track
To confirm that the card is encoded correctly you can examine it in the inventory screen or swipe the card again and the reader will display the currently encoded identity
Exit the keycard screen and then zoom in on the chassis on the left side of the control station
Click to open the top panel and then take theG L card out of the socket then back out of the zoom
The video wall and two of the three security control systems will shut down
You can also check out the LCT in here and some of the other objects if you rsquo d like
When you rsquo re ready head back into the hallway
L hallway Go back to the only door on this level that has a keycard reader
Use the newly recodedkeycardon the door control to unlock it then click to go inside
Central computer control Access the LCT then enter the big room
ANNIE speaks up as you enter
Click on the monitor on the central pillar
It looks like she rsquo s offline
Click the button to enter maintenance mode
Exit the screen and look around
The machines that rose up from the floor have status lights that match the monitor screen are red is green
Go to each of the red machines and open the drawer
Inside are a series of boards one of which is burned out
Click on the burned out board to remove it and then use the corresponding replacement board from your inventory to replace it
Once the new board is in place click the button in front of it to change the color of the symbol in the hologram so that it rsquo s different from all the others
The goal colors are also in order of decreasing wavelength which is also the order of the rainbow Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Violet
When successfully configured you rsquo ll be able to see the status lights of each machine switch from red to green when you rsquo ve backed out of the zoom
You can also view the status of all four machines at once by zooming into the monitor on the central pillar
Once all four machines are green use the monitor on the central pillar to Initiate Startup
Act Two Welcome to Act
You rsquo ve now met ANNIE and even though she rsquo s still pretty messed up at least she rsquo s starting to pull herself together
If you look at the big monitor near the exit you rsquo ll see that it rsquo s now active
If you click on the screen you rsquo ll see an animated display of how much of ANNIE rsquo s neural network is online and functional
Currently it rsquo s operational which is probably why she often stutters distorts and generally sounds quite robotic although this is already a considerable improvement over the general status messages barking over the PA before she was restarted
She asked for help with an area down on Level so head out and take the elevator down to Level and go into the one room that rsquo s accessible but still dark
Once you enter ANNIE will make some interesting observations and Data archives dark Okay so you rsquo re a robot
Well that rsquo s one mystery solved isn rsquo t it
Not only that but you rsquo ve got a shiny new interface
First follow the objective and right click to access your new inventory UI system
There rsquo s a tab for all your inventory items including an area where you can drag items to wear them a tab for voicemails another for emails and even one for ANNIE messages
Observant players may also notice that there rsquo s another tab that rsquo s not yet online yet
Hmm
You might also notice that every email and voicemail you rsquo ve seen or heard has automatically been logged and stored for easy access
Click on any icon to toggle playback of a voicemail or message or to read an email
Once you feel comfortable with the updated UI right click to go back to the view of the room and ANNIE will impart you with another gift
The room may not have power but now you don rsquo t need it because of your enhanced vision e viz
You can toggle e viz on anytime with the lt F gt key
Try it out and explore the room
When you get to the far end of the room ANNIE will provide an update of what she thinks is wrong
Apparently there rsquo s a power substation below that can be activated and the power can then be re routed to arrive here and your objectives screen should update accordingly
If you haven rsquo t already found it before leaving Data Archives go to the middle of the room and click on the rolltop of the machines next to the walkway
One of them will open to reveal an inner control area with a portable diagnostic computer
Click on the connector at the end of the cable to unplug the machine and take it with you
This is aBELOS Basic Engineering Language Operating System computer
Notice the shape of the socket there may be other places where this socket appears where it could be connected and used
When you rsquo re ready head back into the hallway
For an extra bit of fun you can leave e viz on if you like and see what happens when you move into a well lit room
Once you rsquo ve toggled e viz off and things are back to normal make your way to the elevator and head down to Level
On the way ANNIE will connect with you via a radio uplink
Now she won rsquo t be blaring over the entire PA system just to contact you
Since the link is bi directional she rsquo ll also be able to react to what you see and do and can offer helpful feedback
L hallway When you exit the elevator move up the hallway to the doors that ANNIE has now managed to unlock for you
You can proceed as you like but for the purposes of this walkthrough go to the door that rsquo s halfway down the corridor on the right and then click on it to enter a new area
Skyway You may recognize this area albeit from a different viewpoint from the video wall in Security
If you walk forward you see that half the Skyway is lit and the other half is not
If you walk to the dark end the door won rsquo t open because there rsquo s no power
Look closely at the station in the middle of the Skyway and you rsquo ll see aBELOSport
UseBELOSon the port to hook it up then click on the screen
BELOS Since we want to turn the power on and the system indicated a power anomaly at P type in ACTIVATE P and then hit lt ENTER gt
The crackling of electricity sounds interesting if a little disconcerting
Type QUIT and hit lt ENTER gt to leave theBELOSscreen
Looking around it rsquo s nice to see that the hallway is now fully lit and the door at what used to be the dark end now has a green light
Unfortunately if you look down you rsquo ll see that there rsquo s electricity arcing through the puddle of coolant or other fluid that rsquo s on the floor here so there rsquo s no way to reach the door like this
Click onBELOSagain
And type OPEN D lt ENTER gt to remotely open the far door then type DEACTIVATE P lt ENTER gt to turn off the power
Once again QUIT lt ENTER gt will get you out of theBELOSscreen
No more electricity arcing and although half the Skyway is still dark the door is open
Head through the door
Manufacturing dark It rsquo s dark here but that rsquo s not a problem
Hit lt F gt to activate e viz and have a look around
Objectives will update to find a way to get power to this room
Remember you can toggle the display of the current objective with either the lt TAB gt or lt F gt keys
Move toward the elevator and take theboardthat is leaning against the column
It rsquo s one of the wall panels and is fully insulated
Head back to Skyway
Skyway Go to the middle of Skyway again and use theboardon the puddle
Click on theBELOSscreen and enter ACTIVATE P lt ENTER gt to restore power
With the insulated board covering the puddle you can traverse the hallway freely
Click on theBELOSconnector to disconnect it from the socket here and take it with you
It might come in handy again later
Go through the door to Manufacturing where you picked up the board
Manufacturing lit Now that power is on in here the Objectives will update to remind you that you need to get the power subsystem in here working
There are two workstation screens that are active in here right now
If you move to the middle of the room and face the lit screens Factory Power is on the left and Factory Waste is on the right
Accessing the Factory Power screen shows that there is an issue with the waste lines so click on the Factory Waste screen
The diagram shows two red indicators line and pipe B
Looks like those will have to be fixed before the power can be started up
There rsquo s also the word ALERT in the bottom left of the screen
What rsquo s that about
Click on it and you rsquo ll find an interesting message between co workers
If you rsquo d like you can try the elevator
In fact judging from the removed wall panel and the exposed wiring and materials there it looks like someone else may have been trying to get it to work
Since there rsquo s no other way out of here right now head back through Skyway and into the Service Corridor
Service corridor After you come through the door from Skyway turn right and move to the end of the corridor
Look to the left and you rsquo ll see that the last door here has a green status light and is accessible
Head inside
Waste processing Move down the steps and check out the LCT then move forward to the workstations
Examine the screen of the workstation on the left and you rsquo ll see an indication of the pipe B issue The valve is closed and needs to be open but it needs to be done manually
Head out through the side door onto the catwalk
Turn right and move onto the lift then press the button to ride down to the lower level platform
At the bottom move forward to the pipes on the wall and look closely to see pipes A B and C Right click and go into inventory
Click on theshard then click on the brokenstun batonto unscrew and remove the plates
Then use theshardor thestyluson thestun batonto remove the burned out power core
Now use thestun batonwith the square hole on the bolt for pipe B
Once it rsquo s in place clickand drag to rotate the stun baton until the valve indicator is horizontal i e
open
Back out of the zoom by moving the mouse toward the bottom of the screen
Return to the lift and press the button to go back up
If you rsquo d like you can explore the catwalk and travel around part of the Waste Processing area
When you rsquo re ready to continue re enter the control room
Click on the workstation monitor again
If A B and C are all green now click the ldquo Process Waste rdquo button
Head back to the Service Corridor
Service corridor Turn around and look to the left of the stairs that lead to Waste Processing
Pull the lever and the signal light will change from yellow to green
Move to the middle of the corridor then go through Skyway and back into Manufacturing
Manufacturing Go into the Factory Waste screen and all the indicators should be green
Click the ldquo Activate rdquo button to clear all the lines and send the contents to Waste Processing
Now go into the Factory Power screen
The power issue appears to require a manual startup due to some damage so click the button and you rsquo ll be taken to a screen with a list of subsystems and a series of power feeds
Each subsystem requires a particular load at startup and then a sustained load
The graphs for each subsystem illustrate how the power cycle works for each particular system
Material Distros for example requires a massive amount of initial power which tapers down to a relatively low sustained load
Assembly Systems by comparison requires the same load at startup and when sustained
To assign the different subsystems to the available power feeds click and drag on the solid colored square swatches to one of the power conduits
Overloading a line will reset the puzzle
There are several solutions to this puzzle
Here rsquo s one way to do it Conveyor System yellow to A
Once it settles move to C Molecular Lattice light green to A
Once it settles move to C in the available gap
Material Distros orange to A
Once it settles move to B Cleanup Controllers purple to A
Once it settles move to B in the available gap
Nanolathe Controller turquoise to A
Assembly Systems blue to the available gap in A
Once you rsquo ve succeeded in assigning all subsystems to the available power feeds a confirmation message and a ldquo Startup rdquo button will appear
Click it and then exit the screen
ANNIE will congratulate you but it sounds like she rsquo ll need some help getting into Data Archives
If you haven rsquo t already checked out the LCT in here you may want to have a look and listen on your way out
Then head back through Skyway and into the Service Corridor then take the elevator up to Level and go into Data Archives
Data archives lit Thanks to your efforts Data Archives is now lit and operational
Head to the far end where the control console and the big monitor are located
If you examine the console controls you rsquo ll see that there rsquo s a malfunction so you rsquo ll need to find another way to access the archives
Just below the console display you may notice a HAC interface socket
If that sounds familiar it rsquo s probably because you may have noticed the HAC chip in your inventory
If you look at your inventory screen and hover over the HAC chip the description text includes ldquo POWER SYSTEMS rdquo as a known keyword
Since the archives need to be aligned move back to the middle of the room and open the roll top where theBELOSsystem was originally found
Reconnect it to the socket
Now that the room is powered click on the screen and you rsquo ll be able to access and align the archives
As with the Skyway you can type HELP lt ENTER gt for a list of commands
To obtain the alignment address type LOOKUP POWER SYSTEMS lt ENTER gt
Next use the supplied address to align the archives by entering LOAD lt ENTER gt
Once you receive confirmation that the archives are aligned move back to the console with the HAC socket
The HAC chip is not like other inventory items
Most of the time you can activate it simply by hovering over a particular object or connector
Hover over the connector to use the HAC chip on the socket and take a ride into the holographic digital world of the archives
Holographic data archives To find the schematic head up to the top of the tower
You rsquo ll see an article with ldquo SCHEMATIC rdquo and the description ldquo Engineering schematic detected Parser unavailable rdquo Click on it
You can rsquo t process all the schematic data but ANNIE can see through you and she rsquo ll be able to receive all the data
Once ANNIE reads the schematic she rsquo ll also be able to alter the programming in your HAC chip which will unlock the ability to download camera buffers
You might recall one of Zemith rsquo s voicemails describing the camera system and the buffers
With this new skill you can now begin to piece together the events that occurred after the main systems went offline
Before you leave the tower you can scan through some of the other articles if you rsquo d like to learn about some of the power system technologies used on the mission
There are that can be found in this particular tower
When you rsquo re ready to leave look downward while on the bottom level of the tower and click on the platform to return to your body in the Data Archives room
You rsquo ll see a new tab in the UI for ldquo Cameras rdquo which will store all the camera buffers that you download like the tabs for ldquo Voicemails rdquo and ldquo Emails rdquo
Now if you rsquo d like you can go back into any room that has a camera and download it and listen to what happened there
If you go to Medical for example listening to the camera buffer will give you a glimpse into what the data in the holoprojector is all about
You may even hear and recognize the holoprojector operational sounds in the playback of the camera buffer
Other cameras can be downloaded as well
Not all of them have contents in the buffer but most of them do
Using the time stamps on the emails voicemails and cameras you can even begin to assemble a timeline of the recorded events
Also as you explore the game and learn more about the mission and the Letarri you can return to Data Archives and try looking up different words with the ldquo LOOKUP rdquo command throughBELOS
This will unlock additional towers that you can explore which will have more details about the mission and their world
When you rsquo re ready to continue disconnectBELOSfrom the terminal so that it goes back into your inventory and then head up to Security
Security Right click to go into the inventory screen the look at the camera next to the door to activate your HAC chip and download the camera buffer
Go to the console with the monitor that rsquo s still active and you rsquo ll see that it shows a fire alert
Listen to the camera buffer from this room and you rsquo ll hear two crewmembers reacting to what sounds like some serious trouble
You rsquo ll also hear one of them mention the override code
Enter it on the console and then click ldquo CONTINUE rdquo to deactivate the fire alert
Leave Security and go left and then turn left again at the T junction
Go around the corner and you rsquo ll see that the large fire door now has a green light overhead instead of the red locked light
Head over and click on the door to go to the next area
Note At this point you rsquo re about halfway through the game
Now that you rsquo ve seen and learned much about the game and the core gameplay you rsquo re welcome to continue the adventure on your own or you can turn the page and proceed with the walkthrough
Act Three Congratulations
You rsquo ve made it to Act
Hydroponics Upon entering the new area which looks to be a hydroponics farm two things have become clear you rsquo re in space and presumably on the colony ship and more distressingly that this ship is heading toward the star at the center of the New Letarr system
Take a look around and you rsquo ll notice the large domed hydroponic farm dominating the center of the area
Outside the window to your right is the emptiness of space
On the catwalk leading around the room are a variety of machines
Also nearby you will see an LCT terminal
Click on it and read through the logs
Then look above the LCT and you rsquo ll see a camera above
Hover over it to download the two camera logs
Go into your interface to listen to them
Interesting
Head along the catwalk to your right
Once you reach the end of the catwalk in this direction you rsquo ll notice a ladder
Click on it to move down to the lower level
Once you step off the ladder head to the left towards a squat piece of machinery
Looking down at it you rsquo ll see a rectangular service access panel
Use the key from your inventory to open it and then click on a yellow power core inside the panel to remove it
If the term ldquo power core rdquo sounds familiar to you it might be because you removed a burnt out power core from the stun baton that you found in Power Control
You will find that by inserting this working power core into the disassembledstun baton and then replacing the charge plates that you can make a working stun baton
Awesome
But what is it good for
Well more on that later Continue to walk down the lower level catwalk past the large window to your right until youreach the end of the walkway
Here you will find another piece of machinery this time with an open panel and aBELOSplug wired into it
This must be where Teleda was hacking into the controls to alter the gravity in the Cafeteria but where is the Cafeteria
Head back to the ladder and back up to the upper level
Work your way around the catwalk to the door on the far side
Click on this door to enter the Cafeteria
Cafeteria Clearly with all the debris in this room a massive explosion happened here
The elevator is here but with all the debris inside it you aren rsquo t able to use it
The explosion also cracked the front window
There must be a way to clear the elevator of debris or get into the elevator shaft from a lower level
This elevator shaft here is connected to the Manufacturing area the room with the open wall panel next to the elevator
Head back through Hydroponics follow the corridor to the elevator and take the elevator down to the first floor
Exit and head to the door on the right follow the Skyway into Manufacturing
Manufacturing Once you rsquo ve made it here head to the elevator
Above the elevator is a camera
Use your ability to access cameras by hovering the cursor over it and downloading the camera buffer
Listen to the recording to discover an interesting fact about the elevators electrical discharges will automatically open the doors in an emergency
Use thestun batonon the elevator door to open it
You will now be inside the elevator shaft
Looking up you rsquo ll see the ladder has broken above you so make your way down the ladder instead
Once at the bottom head to the elevator shaft door
As before use thestun batonon the door to open it
Cargo You are now inside Cargo
Head forward to the box sitting on the catwalk
Face it and click on the top to open it then click on the contents inside to retrieve one of them and a cutscene will play
It appears as though YOU are complicit in the sabotage
ANNIE however seems to think you had been reprogrammed to do what you did and is still willing to work with you to save the mission
You have retrieved awrapped seismic chargefrom the box so now you can head back to the door you came through and head back up the elevator shaft to Manufacturing
Once in Manufacturing head back through the Skyway to the Service Corridor and into the working elevator
Take this elevator up to the third floor and then head down the hallway through Hydroponics and back in the Cafeteria
Cafeteria Once back in the Cafeteria you will notice that the window is cracked
It is possible that an explosion at that point would blow out the window and decompress the room potentially clearing the debris
You now have the seismic charge but if you read the description for it in your player UI you know that it requires an electrical charge to detonate
The stun baton discharges an electrical charge so use theshardto cut open thewrapped seismic charge
Then take theseismic chargeand attach it onto the end of thestun baton
Now you have what is essentially a bomb
Unfortunately the bomb will only work if you squeeze the trigger which would result in your demise
Clearly That's not going to work
But the stun baton does have a socket at the end for a remote connector to be attached and you have aURCin your inventory that you picked up in Colony Communications
Examine theURCin your inventory and you rsquo ll notice the numbers ldquo rdquo on the side
Attach theURCto the end of thestun baton and now you have an explosive device that can be remotely triggered
Much better
Zoom into the view of the window where the crack is and place the on the shelf by the crack
For extra laughs try clicking the stun baton trigger a few times after you rsquo ve placed it on the shelf
When you rsquo re ready head out of the Cafeteria and back towards Colony Communications
Colony communications Go to the far side of the room by the three consoles
The middle console is a signal generator
Set the frequency to the number from the side of theURC then hit TRANSMIT
ANNIE stops you from detonating the bomb because she rsquo s calculated that the decompressionalone won rsquo t be enough to eject the debris from the Cafeteria
She suggests trying to reduce the weight of the debris
Hm
Wasn rsquo t Teleda working in Hydroponics to turn off the gravity in the Cafeteria in the hopes of using zero g to clear the elevator debris
Head to Hydroponics
Hydroponics Head to the ladder to go to the lower floor
Once there walk along the walkway past the large windows until you rsquo re in front of the machinery that has theBELOSconnector wired into it
Plug in theBELOSterminal and type ldquo HELP rdquo to get a list of available commands
ldquo FLOATCAFE rdquo seems to be the one to use so type it in and hit lt ENTER gt
Once you do this you rsquo ll hear the door to the Cafeteria automatically locking as the gravity turns off
Then type ldquo EXIT rdquo and hit lt ENTER gt to exit theBELOSscreen
With this complete head back to Colony Communications
Colony communications Return to the signal generator console and input once again and hit TRANSMIT to see the results of your efforts
Wow
The explosion has cleared the debris and after a few moments ANNIE activates the shutters to seal the breach and re pressurizes the Cafeteria
Well now it rsquo s time to go forward to the Cafeteria and find out where the elevator can take us
But first ANNIE informs us that because of the explosion the ship has changed its orientation and the antenna is now picking up a faint signal
She suggests using the antenna array controls in Communications
Since we rsquo re already here let rsquo s do that
The leftmost terminal in the bank of three consoles is the antenna array controls
Use the controls on the bottom of the screen to adjust the pitch and heading of the antenna dish
As you get closer to the correct position the static will clear and the transmission will become clearer
Once you get to the correct positions for both pitch and heading ANNIE will begin downloading the message to decrypt it and the screen will reveal details about the message
The correct positions are approximately for both pitch and heading
So THAT rsquo s where the crew went
They left in shuttles to New Letarr rsquo s surface but they rsquo re in serious trouble
Looks like it rsquo s up to you and ANNIE to get them the supplies they need one way or another
With the transmission complete you can now head to Hydroponics
Hydroponics Head down to the lower level and head to where you plugged in theBELOSsystem
Using the terminal type in the command to restore the gravity to the Cafeteria ldquo RESTORECAFE rdquo lt ENTER gt
You should hear the door unlock
Type ldquo EXIT rdquo and hit lt ENTER gt to leave the terminal screen
Grab theBELOSterminal before you head back up the ladder and head into the Cafeteria
Cafeteria Well THIS looks a lot better
The emergency shutter has closed over the hole in the window
The debris is cleared and the elevator looks available for use
Head into the elevator
On the panel showing the floors available notice that you have floors denoted by the numbers one through four and then the lowest level is named ldquo CL rdquo
The door at the bottom of this elevator shaft led to Cargo so the ldquo CL rdquo is most likely ldquo Cargo Level rdquo
Since you climbed down the elevator shaft one level from the elevator opening in Manufacturing that rsquo s level ldquo rdquo
The elevator shows we rsquo re on level ldquo rdquo right now so that leaveslevels and to explore
Click ldquo rdquo to head down to level first and then click on the door to exit into the Hangar
Hangar Inside the Hangar turn to your right and look up to get the log from the camera on the wall by the elevator door
Then make your way down the corridor to the right of the stairway heading to the upper level
Continue forward once more to the open space where the shuttles are
Well where they are supposed to be
ANNIE tells you that the shuttles have been launched and that you should head up to the elevator to the fourth floor to find the Bridge
Before that though explore the Hangar
You rsquo ll find a fire door on the top level that rsquo s locked as well as crane controls
Heading back down the staircase head to the door you walked past to get to the shuttle area
This leads to Hangar control The Hangar Control room
Inside this room are all the controls for launching and tracking active shuttles
Immediately after entering checking out the LCT on the wall to your left
And then head to the sparking camera on the wall opposite the door
From the logs you rsquo ll learn that Alavaji apparently stayed behind to try to fix the ship
Head to the back of the room and look down and to your left to find the pair ofmagnetic boots
Pick them up and then head out of the room
You can explore the rest of the Hangar if you wish
We might come back later depending on how you choose to proceed in the final stages of the game
When you rsquo re ready head back into the elevator
Click lsquo rsquo to head to the fourth floor
Bridge Foyer Stepping out of the elevator first look up and to the left to get the log from the camera
Sounds like someone else besides Alavaji didn rsquo t want to leave as well
Turn around and try the door
ANNIE informs you that the door to the Bridge is locked down with voice recognition and you rsquo ll need a voiceprint to get inside
Head back into the elevator and head down to level
Walk through the Cafeteria and into Hydroponics
Once in Hydroponics turn to the right and head down the walkway
At the L corner look down to see the open air vent cover
Climb into the duct and through the vent to get into the Habitat Silo
Habitat silo The habitat silo has no gravity so you rsquo re floating out in the middle of the top of the silo
Go into your inventory and drag themagnetic bootsonto the WEAR icon and you rsquo ll be able to stand on the wall by the airvent exit
Since there rsquo s no gravity here you can use the boots to walk down the side of the silo wall until you reach the umbilical connector the contraption with the yellow lights
Hover over it like you would with one of the cameras and your HAC chip will pick up another buffered log from the moment when the explosions happened
When you rsquo re ready head back up to the airvent exit crawl back through the airvent and into Hydroponics again
From there head to the fire door to your right pass through it into the corridor beyond and make your way to Colony Communications
Colony communications Once inside Comms head to the three consoles on the far side of the room
ANNIE has loaded up the rightmost one with the senior crew members who have access to the Bridge and theirtarget voiceprints
There are also for each one a series of voice slices that could be used to generate the voiceprint we need
Alavaji and ren Talove don rsquo t have enough to work with but there should be a full set for ren Keterek
If ANNIE warns you that you don rsquo t have what you need you are missing some
Head back to the cameras you may have missed
You will need the cameras from Hydroponics Hangar Hangar Control Room and the umbilical in Habitat Silo to make the voiceprint
Assemble the voiceprint by dragging each slice so that it matches up to the target waveform and hit CONFIRM
If you rsquo ve done it right ANNIE will inform you that you now have the appropriate voiceprint to get into the Bridge
So let rsquo s head back up there
Bridge foyer In the Bridge Foyer click the lock on the door to automatically play the voiceprint and unlock the door
Then click on the door to go into the Bridge
Bridge Wow bright
Once ANNIE adjusts a few things you can see but its still quite bright
The sun is getting awfully big in the windows
Before you go anywhere look up and to the left of the door you just entered through to pick up a log from the camera there
Then turn back to the main console by the window
If you click on the center console you rsquo ll see a screen similar to the LCT screens and you can find Alavaji rsquo s transmission logs there
Just beneath the screen is an orange security card Alavaji rsquo smaster keycard
Click it to pick it up
This is a high level security card it should open anything that has a card lock on it
Continue to explore this room and when you are ready leave through the door
ANNIE will make a recommendation about getting the factory online
It rsquo s time to head down to Power Control
Once you get there make your way to the back of the room
The door there leads into Propulsion Control
Use your high level engineer rsquo smaster keycardto unlock the door
Propulsion control Inside Propulsion Control you rsquo ll see an LCT directly ahead
Walk to it and you may notice a locker to the right with a hazard suit inside
Check out the logs in the LCT and you rsquo ll find that the lock on the hazmat suit locker has been programmed with Raphe Secarra rsquo s birthday
You could go back up to Security to get his birthday from the Security console but you disabled that equipment when you pulled theG L card out of it to help repair ANNIE
Hm
Also in the room is a Propulsion Control panel but without more power from the Core it won rsquo t work
Head back to the corner of the room with the two doors at right angles to each other and go through the left one into the Core Control Room
Core control room What a mess
This room like the Cafeteria has seen better days
Look up and to your right to get the log from the camera there
Listen and you rsquo ll hear yet again that crucial moment went everything went awry this time from Alavaji and Harije rsquo s post here in Core Control
Next head to the door on the far side
Click on the door and you rsquo ll find that in order for the door to unlock you rsquo ll need a hazmat suit on
Turn around and look down to find a usableG L card amidst the rubble
Aha
We can use this to find Raphe rsquo s birthday
Head back out the door you came in and head back to Security on the third floor
Security Once inside Security head to the console
Click on the box to the left of the terminal
Open the cover and insert theG L card you found in Core Control into the slot
The system will power up again
Go into your UI and bring up Reitessa rsquo s medical report for R Secarra to get his ID number and then enter it into the Security workstation
His security record will appear including his birth date
That five digit code will be used to open the door to the hazmat locker in Propulsion Control
So let rsquo s get down there
Propulsion Control Back in Propulsion Control head to the locker and click on the keypad to the right of the locker door
Input the five digit code and the door should unlock
Exit the zoom and click on the door to open the locker
Click on thehazard suitto pick it up
Go into your inventory and wear the suit by dropping it onto the WEAR icon where the magnetic boots are
Once you change into the suit you rsquo ll notice that your view is restricted slightly by the helmet
Now head back through the wreckage of Core Control to the door that leads to the Core and click on it
This time the door should open and you rsquo ll enter the Core
Core Inside the Core things are bad
Even with the haz suit there rsquo s so much radiation that your optical sensors are malfunctioning and you rsquo re effectively blind
Eviz doesn rsquo t help much in this situation but fortunately you rsquo ve restored and repaired ANNIE well enough that she can direct you verbally
Listen for her instructions about what which way to turn and when to proceed forward
Once you get to a certain point you will be near a console and can click on it which will re activate the core containment field
Much better
Now you can actually see the full layout of the Core
Explore around a bit
Once you are through it rsquo s time to head back to Power Control
Note If you want to play through both endings of the game this is a good spot to save the game
Power control Back in Power Control head to your left after going down the steps and you rsquo ll be at the Power Allocation console
Swipe your engineer rsquo smaster keycardto access the allocation system
Now that the Core is providing more power we can allocate power to various parts of the ship
There are two profiles loaded that have enough energy from the Core to work ANNIE rsquo s profile provides the necessary power for building a shuttle to escape
Alavaji rsquo s profile is from his attempt at fixing the ship
Once the choice is made it cannot be changed
Choose one of the profiles and then move the highlighted sliders all the way up to the ldquo FULL rdquo setting
When everything is set click EXECUTE
If you pick ANNIE rsquo s shuttle profile continue the walkthrough using Act IV A page
If you pick Alavaji rsquo s fix the ship profile continue with Act IV B page
Act Four Choice A Build a shuttle Now that you rsquo ve activated ANNIE rsquo s profile in the Power Allocation screen the factory now has full power and you can work on building yourself a shuttle to escape the doomed Laeril
ANNIE will inform you that in order to use the factory you rsquo ll need to load the console in Manufacturing with blueprints from Data Archives
To do this she provides a new keyword ldquo SPACECRAFT rdquo
So let rsquo s head back up to Data Archives
Data archives Like before use the BelOS terminal on the connector in the console near the center of the room
Type in ldquo LOOKUP SPACECRAFT rdquo and hit lt ENTER gt to get the address for the data tower
Then use the ldquo LOAD rdquo command with the address to realign the archives so that you can access it
Once the archives are aligned leave the BelOS terminal and enter the archives at the end of the room by looking at the HAC interface
This will bring you into the Data Archive Tower
Data archive tower Inside the tower you rsquo ll need to find three blueprints
Two of them are on the first level of the tower the other one is one the top level
Enter each article so that ANNIE can see them through your optics
She will store a copy and send it to the manufacturing terminal
Once you get all three she will then direct you to go to Manufacturing to build yourself a shuttle
Leave the tower through the bottom of the lowest level and then make your way through the ship to Manufacturing
Manufacturing Head to the far side of the room by the elevator
Facing the elevator look to the left and you rsquo ll be able to access the Fabrication terminal
Click on it to enter the interface
ANNIE has already loaded the blueprints
The setup for the first one is shown in the upper right corner and indicates how the factory should be configured in order to build the first part of the shuttle
The fabrication process begins when you hit the SIMULATE button
One raw resource will appear at each of the node to the right of the labels A B and C They will travel along the conveyor pieces that you place on the grid
A piece will travel for seconds along a straight conveyence and only second along a curve
One or more pieces can also be processed in the stations A B C and D
Resources must arrive at stations at the same time
They process for a certain number of seconds indicated on the combiner and then exit the right side of the station as a new material to continue along the conveyence
The final result must arrive at the green exit marker on the grid
The solutions to each blueprint template are as follows other solutions do exist Stage One Stage Two Stage Three Once you are done ANNIE lets you know that the shuttle is being moved up to the Hangar
Make your way up there using the elevator
Hangar Once you are in the Hangar turn to the right and head forward on the ground floor
You rsquo ll see the shuttle waiting for you
ANNIE mentioned that in order for the shuttle to aid the colonists it needs to have the supplies on the hangar bay floor loaded onto it
Before you board the shuttle turn around and head back toward the elevator and then turn right and walk up the stairs
Follow the walkway along the wall past the large fire door to your left and then turn right
Move forward make another right and you rsquo ll be in front of the cargo crane controls
Click on it to load the cargo onto the shuttle
Return to the front of the shuttle and climb aboard
Okay all ready to go
Click on the console to launch the shuttle and there rsquo s something wrong
Teleda had mentioned something in her logs about the shuttles not having working navigation modules and it looks like the issue wasn rsquo t resolved in these blueprints
You rsquo ll need to find another nav module
ANNIE mentions that there is one in Research
She also suggests getting into Research by going outside the ship through Waste Processing
Make your way to Waste Processing
Waste processing Walk down the staircase and toward the bank of consoles
The rightmost one controls the disposal of waste tanks
If you activate it you rsquo ll notice that the full waste tank in the chute launches off and then another one takes its place
In order to use that chute you rsquo ll have to come up with a way to stop a new tank from entering the chute
To do this you rsquo ll need to take a closer look at the mechanism there
Head out of the control room and make a left and then follow the walkway around the room until you get to the chute
You rsquo ll see the tanks lined up and a conveyor track that guides each tank into the chute
Look closely and you rsquo ll notice that the track itself is covered by a safety shield
A card reader is there to retract the shield for maintenance or in case of a jam
Use Alavaji rsquo smaster keycardon the card reader
Next use the shard on the conveyor track to jam it
Once the shard is in place head back to the control room and use the console there once more
This time the barrel in the chute will launch but nothing will replace it leaving the chute open for you to enter
Head back to the chute and go down into the tube
You rsquo ll need to drag thehazard suitonto the WEAR icon once more not because you need to breathe but because the radiation this close to the sun is likely to fry some delicate circuitry
Once you rsquo ve suited up move through the first door into the airlock then look to the left and pull the manual control lever
The airlock will be activated and you rsquo ll slowly make your way over to Research Inside Research you rsquo ll need to activate your eviz by hitting lt F gt
Looking around it rsquo s pretty clear that an explosion blasted a hole in the side of the hull here
Head forward and down the stairs to the flickering LCT look up to see the camera and download the log here
Then head back up the stairs and make a left
Move forward and look to your right
The first probe launch tube was once where the hole in the hull now resides but the second probe launch tube is intact
Click on it to open it and access the probe
Click on the outer shell of the probe to slide open the top and then click on thenavigation moduleto retrieve it
Once you have it head back to Waste Processing remove thehazard suit and then continue onwards to the Hangar and into the shuttle
Shuttle Once in the shuttle use thenav moduleon the middle console and ANNIE will let you know that you can launch when ready
Click the flight console and you rsquo ll launch the shuttle escape the Laeril and bring much needed supplies to the colony
Congratulations
You made it to the end of Prominence
Act Four Choice B Fix the ship Although ANNIE has warned you about the potential dangers of this path she is still willing to help you
Now that you rsquo ve activated Alavaji rsquo s profile in the Power Allocation screen you can activate the engines in Propulsion Control
Go back up the steps and through the door into Propulsion Control
Propulsion control Turn to your left and move to the console there
Click on the screen and you rsquo ll now be able to energize the engines
Move the sliders up to full for each engine
It rsquo s going to take a lot of power to escape the pull of the sun
Once this is done ANNIE will advise that you get Hydroponics online before heading to New Letarr to rescue the colonists
While the factory can churn out materials quickly ready with all its supplies and machinery Hydroponics isn rsquo t operational yet and food takes time to grow
We can help the colonists out by getting Hydroponics up and running
To do this we rsquo ll need to find CO cartridges from atmoscrubbers around the ship and two ofthem should be enough to provide the gas needed to get the plants growing
Exit Power Control and take the elevator up to the third floor
Once you leave the elevator head to Security
Security Behind the chair at the console is an atmoscrubber with a red light
Click on the panel on the central part of the unit and it will open
Click on theCO cartridgeto add it to your inventory
L hallway Leave Security and head down the corridor towards Hydroponics
At the end of the corridor by the fire door turn to your left to find another atmoscrubber with a red light
Again click on it to open the panel and then click on theCO cartridgeto retrieve it
Then go through the fire door into Hydroponics
Hydroponics Once inside Hydroponics move forward once and turn to your left
You will see a terminal and two large vats with receptacles mounted on them
Insert firstCO cartridgeinto one of the receptacles then turn and use the secondCO cartridgeon the other receptacle
Once both are in position click on the terminal screen
Rotate the two dials so that they point upward toward the leaf symbols to unlock and activate the cartridges
Once you have finished this Hydroponics is now online
Great
ANNIE now tells you to head to the Bridge so that she can help you plot a course to New Letarr
Bridge Back on the Bridge though clicking on the main console by the window reveals a problem
The navigational module is burned out apparently and needs replacement
Teleda had mentioned something in her logs about the shuttles not having working navigation modules as well
You rsquo ll need to find a replacement
ANNIE mentions that there is one in Research
She also suggests getting into Research by going outside the ship through Waste Processing
Make your way toWasteProcessing
The easiest way to get there is to take the elevator in the Bridge Foyer down to level then walk through Manufacturing and Skyway then turn right once you arrive in the Service Corridor
The door at the end leads to Waste Processing
Waste processing Walk down the staircase and toward the bank of consoles
The rightmost one controls the disposal of waste tanks
If you activate it you rsquo ll notice that the full waste tank in the chute launches off and then another one takes its place
In order to use that chute you rsquo ll have to come up with a way to stop a new tank from entering the chute
To do this you rsquo ll need to take a closer look at the mechanism there
Head out of the control room and make a left and then follow the walkway around the room until you get to the chute
You rsquo ll see the tanks lined up and a conveyor track that guides each tank into the chute
Look closely and you rsquo ll notice that the track itself is covered by a safety shield
A card reader is there to retract the shield for maintenance or in case of a jam
Use Alavaji rsquo smaster keycardon the card reader
Next use the shard on the conveyor track to jam it
Once the shard is in place head back to the control room and use the console there once more
This time the barrel in the chute will launch but nothing will replace it leaving the chute open for you to enter
Head back to the chute and go down into the tube
You rsquo ll need to drag thehazard suitonto the WEAR icon once more not because you need to breathe but because the radiation this close to the sun is likely to fry some delicate circuitry
Once you rsquo ve suited up move through the first door into the airlock then look to the left and pull the manual control lever
The airlock will be activated and you rsquo ll slowly make your way over to Research Inside Research you rsquo ll need to activate your eviz by hitting lt F gt
Looking around it rsquo s pretty clear that an explosion blasted a hole in the side of the hull here
Head forward and down the stairs to the flickering LCT look up to see the camera and download the log here
Then head back up the stairs and make a left
Move forward and look to your right
The first probe launch tube was once where the hole in the hull now resides but the second probe launch tube is intact
Click on it to open it and access the probe
Click on the outer shell of the probe to slide open the top and then click on thenavigation moduleto retrieve it
Once you have it head back to Waste Processing remove thehazard suit and then continue onwards to the Bridge
Bridge Head to the small console on the right side and plug the nav module into the top
Once it is in place click on the main console at the front of the Bridge to begin the trip to New Letarr
All looks good except it seems like there is a problem with the HAC chip in the navigation console
Turn back to the nav console and click on the lower panel to reveal components and a burnt out HAC chip
ANNIE scans the ship for another one but the only other one on the ship is yours
Enter your inventory by right clicking
Scrolling with the mouse wheel will not bring up the HAC chip since it rsquo s not meant to be removed
Click on the HAC chip to select it right click to get back to the main view ignore the warning messages and then click to place it into the slot
Immediately the bridge computer begins rewriting the memory for use
You have bravely sacrificed yourself to save the Letarri and their mission
Congratulations
You made it to the end of Prominence
