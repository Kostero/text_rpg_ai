RAMA By Soren Andersen Observations amp Comments Introduction This very excellent game is based on the second of a series of four science fiction novels by Arthur C Clarke and Gentry Lee
You do not need to have read it to appreciate what you will encounter indeed the inevitable differences that are found to exist between the book and the game can be annoying to the purist
A concise declaration of the game rsquo s background situation is given in the mission statement on page of the booklet that is to be found in the jewel case containing the game CD rsquo s and there is more amplification during the introductory video
As is characteristic of most Adventure games RAMA is a linear one in that you must acquire certain items and perform certain tasks before you can get other essential items or execute other tasks as you proceed through the landscapes and situations to the game conclusion There is of course a most efficient way to do this but without some sort of guidance rudimentary or detailed there will be much traveling back and forth between sites particularly as existing situations or future necessary actions can change depending what has or has not already been done all of which makes for a more fascinating and challenging game
Fortunately this traveling from site to site in contrast to many other adventure games is readily performed particularly in the Central Plains part of the game
You will encounter three locations that have been named London Bangkok and New York if there are any reasons for choosing these names they are not evident
Game Booklet As always the game booklet is very important
In addition to detailing how to use your mouse to interface with the game it describes several features that have been incorporated by the game rsquo s designers
It is worthwhile to review some of these As mentioned above the mission statement provides a concise setting of the situation upon which the game is built page has an outline drawing of the RAMA spacecraft including dimensions
As soon as you can access theGame Optionsicon of page reduce the audio volume drastically
As is stated this affects only the background music if this is not done it will be difficult in many instances to understand what the characters are saying to you
In fact you might wish to eliminate music completely as it can be less than enjoyable after much repetition
The compass as described on page is a handy device for assistance in keeping oriented particularly in the confined environment of New York and with its center arrows indicating possible viewpoints
The availability of an upward view is indicated by an upward pointing arrow above the compass a downward one by an arrow outside the compass ring pointing at you
There does not seem to have been enough space allowed in the frame for the ldquo triangular spike rdquo on the hoop to point directly left and right so that it is a little off when you are looking due east or west
Read very carefully the section on the Central Plains Radar Map on page then after you have experienced it read it again to be sure you know what it represents realizing that in this area of RAMA you are actually on the inside surface of a cylinder
There are six permanent sites on this map though you can rsquo t get to them all right away which is part of the game rsquo s linearity
There are numerous transitory sites as well some where you will meet other of your companions indicated by their ID numbers and other sites where you will encounter biots
Of these the centipede biots indicated by a string of small green squares are harmless on the other hand the crab biots indicated by a triangle of green squares are deadly if they are coming toward you your white dot the spider biots shown as a green are even more dangerous as they will seek you out for destruction
In the case of the latter two leave immediately by clicking in the general map area
Your arm computer has a map function called aSite Mapon page that is useful at all times but is invaluable in certain situations where you may not be sure where you are such as the corridors between plazas on New York or in the complex lairs on that island there are other places as well
Convenient access to map right click arm computer in inventory then click MAP to return to game right click computer
The computer also has a Mail function page used principally for communication from other of your companions
You cannot send any
Once you get mail it remains available for review
On page you will find two paragraphs concerning your inventory
One of the few negative aspects of this game is the great many items that quickly fill it some of which are never used see the following section on tiles
Some items disappear from inventory after they have been used and are no longer needed others do not
This clutter is compounded by the fact that inventory scrolling is very touchy tapping the mouse button is the way to scroll one line
Inventory clutter is made more manageable if like items are kept together as a suggestion place all of the tiles at the end and panels next to them
The second paragraph is about the ldquo Ramen Eyes rdquo and how to scrutinize inventory objects you will probably find using the right mouse button to get a closeup to be more convenient
Tiles and panels One of the things you will be doing as you roam around the Central Plains near the beginning of the game is gathering the many red bordered square matrix tiles also called symbol plaques that are scattered about a little later you will find more in structures as you gain entrance to them
Some are quite prominent and some are hard to spot a couple need to be freed before you can get them you can well believe these are important
Some are dirty and must be cleaned
There are of these tiles each with a geometric design that is unique but resembles others some very closely
Only about tiles are important the non essential ones are there to make the puzzles more challenging
When you encounter some portals doors gates or elevators you will be presented with a x matrix of tiles with or missing by examining the tile patterns in these matrices you must establish a positional sequence of symbol details both horizontally and vertically of the manner in which the details of the patterns change so that you can select a tile from inventory that will fit in with the matrix pattern sequence
The portal will then be accessible
You start by finding some tiles in a locker then more in a specimen box in the Base Camp
Some are dropped by a biot but most are found lying about in the sites you explore
Of the latter if you don rsquo t get them on the first exploration some will disappear presumably found by your fellow astronauts or picked up by the trash gathering crab biots
Not to worry mdash if found by colleagues they will be presented to you by the finder or they will be placed in the base camp specimen box where you can pick them up by checking it when you find that you need one and you don rsquo t have it
If picked up by a crab biot they might be in a bin next to the large mechanical trash biots at two of the sites or failing that in the central trash pit in which case they must be retrieved and cleaned before use in a matrix
You will have what you need when it comes time to open the first portal whereupon you will find more
The centipede biots will drop tiles at least one of which is an important one
As soon as you can access the radar map look for these biots and collect the tiles that they drop until you have from them after which don't bother with these biots Much of the foregoing commentary may be applied to the subject of the rectangular yellow panels that are also lying around the landscapes and one of the buildings
There are of these panels and in contrast to the tiles all are required
They are used in the assembly of two maps one of the Central Plains and one of New York island
The latter map will be used later as a guide through the elementary New York corridor maze
The main value of the Central Plains map though fun to assemble is the clearing of the panels from inventory
Both maps have areas on which you can click your mouse to get postcard views
Non decimal number systems In addition to testing your pattern recognition and logical progression by the tile selecting puzzles the Ramans also want to determine if you are numerically literate by requiring that you use number systems other than the familiar decimal one
A short primer on some other systems is attached
The first of these systems that you will encounter concerns the tiles
On of the tiles you will find along the bottom edge a series of squares some blank some filled in and some half filled in
Though it is not mentioned anywhere these squares are numbers in a base system in which the empty squares represent the numeral the half filled ones represent the numeral and the fully filled ones represent the numeral
Using either the formula or the equivalency table on page of the primer you can get an equivalent decimal number for each tile and which is one of three factors the others being the small circles and the ldquo toothbrush rdquo in determining which of the tiles will logically fit in a matrix
The Myrmicats and the Avians of RAMA use a hexadecimal number system and the Octospiders an octal one furthermore the former use their own symbols or glyphs or runes or icons take your choice for the sixteen numerals and the Octospiders use colors based on the visible to humans spectrum red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet for the digits to with white for
In this case there can be a problem with the color rendition of your computer red might be confused with orange and it may be difficult to distinguish between indigo and violet
Hopefully if these dilemmas do occur they will be minimal
You won rsquo t meet any live Myrmicats and the Avians speak squawk their numerals but you will get a translating instrument for that and there will be several opportunities to find or build up symbol number correspondence tables
When called upon to make hex decimal and octal decimal conversions or to do hex and octal arithmetic you can do so by hand using the rules of the primer but this is tedious and prone to mistakes
Because it is important here is a repeat of a neat shortcut before you launch the game open the calculator in the Windows accessories and set it to scientific mode then launch the game
You can toggle between the two using the Alt Tab keys doing the conversion and arithmetic on the calculator as required
Hints and walkthrough RAMA is not an easy game it is full of challenges some of them quite obscure a few so much so much so that perhaps it might not be out of place to present some hints that are more specific than can be found in the foregoing comments
For example there is a close connection between the colors in the Octospider lair rotunda ceiling the spike pit and the abacus
the two items you must find in the Avian lair hatchery are a cable and a magnetic card and you use the first in the schoolroom and the other in Security
Other than a changing cursor there is no indication that you need the gold card and the food ball in the Octospider lair lab
You must put the food ball in the subway before Falstaff climbs in and then take it out afterward
A compromise might be to suggest you refer to the many drawings and printouts that are part of the accompanying walkthrough
Without the walkthrough text they do not give much away
The site drawings for instance show you where you can go but not when nor what to do
An exception is the two sheets of six portal matrices as these show the solutions for important puzzles
The comparison table of Avian number symbols with hexadecimal numerals will be very useful
The walkthrough is very detailed and written so that you can refer to it incrementally use it for just the place where you are stuck and no more
There is a lot of excellent gaming in just three CD rsquo s Go to it
mdash mdash Soren Andersen THE GAME WALKTHROUGH By Soren Andersen Introduction This game is largely linear but nonetheless there is a certain amount of randomness both built into it and inherent in the options you choose the details of the path you decide to take and the results of your skills in puzzle solving
The walkthrough that follows is not only successful but is an efficient one in that there is a minimum of non productive moving from location to location
Accompanying this walkthrough are several pages of diagrams and printouts including a short primer on base base and base number systems all of which are part of the walkthrough and these pages and diagrams will be referenced as you proceed
It is suggested that you first glance through them to see what sort of graphic aids you will have to assist you
When mentioned in this text it is expected that the diagram will be at hand
The game begins with you as an astronaut shuttling from an International Space Agency ISA space station to the starship RAMA where you are to replace a deceased astronaut in the team that is already there exploring this mysterious intruder into our solar system
As you approach you get a good view of the exterior of RAMA while a voice in the background relates additional information about the situation
Lucky for you the Ramans have provided a compatible docking facility in the center of one end arbitrarily the South of this enormous spacecraft
It is at this location that the previously arrived astronauts established their initial working location called the Hub Site
The Hub Site You are greeted by Nicole des Jardins the Medical Officer of the crew who explains a few things and then leaves via the cable tram down to the astronauts Base Camp that they have established as their headquarters on the plain below
Go to the main computer that she has indicated here in the Hub Site and click on it to bring in the Mail function where you will find introductory video messages from your nine colleagues
All of these will leave you with first impressions of the senders two messages are highlighted and marked urgent because you need them to proceed
One the greeting from O rsquo Toole provides the code to operate the tram and the other from Wakefield will be allow to get your all knowing guide Puck from his locker
Now go to the lockers
When you arrive you will hear pounding from locker
Open it to find Puck who will give you an explanatory speech then will go into your inventory
You arrived with one other item in inventory a key on which is the number use it to unlock locker wherein you will find your ISA multipurpose tool and your arm computer
Put the tool in inventory then get a closeup of it and click on the white button to see how it performs
It takes two clicks to pick up the computer the first one opens it the second closes it so you can put it in inventory
As you do this you can hear the tram returning
If at some time during all this or maybe a little later you get a mail message from Francesca Sabatini asking you to bring her cigarette lighter down to her ignore it
Now a decision if you take the tram down you will turn on RAMA rsquo s internal lighting system If you do this you should come right back up and finish your Hub Site work otherwise finish it in the dark which is quite readily done and then go down
Should you decide to go down now enter the tram use the yellow buttons to enter O rsquo Toole rsquo s code then press the red button to descend and a short video will show the trip down
The lights will come on as you travel down
As soon as you are down push the red button again to go back up which will happen instantaneously with no reverse travel sequence
Leave the tram and go past the lockers
Turn left and you will see the top of a ladder
Click on the ladder to climb down then turn right and approach the mechanism you will see which turns out to be a nuclear explosive device mdash a bomb in point of fact
It is not activated mdash yet
Pick up the key that is on the ledge next to the INACTIVE sign
Return up the ladder to the lockers
Use the Map function of your arm computer a couple times to see where you are
You can also get commentary from Puck as you move about
Apparently in this game you have no qualms about snooping in your colleague rsquo s lockers and appropriating items that you find in them
Right click on the key you just acquired to get a closeup of it and you will see that it has the number on it
Open locker Sabatini rsquo s and pick up three square matrix tiles also called symbol plaques two rectangular yellow map panels a datacube and another key
Leave the lighter
Click the datacube on your arm computer to find a mail message from Sabatini to Dr Brown
A closeup of the key from the locker shows no number but it appears to be a locker key
If you run it past the locker doors it will highlight red on number
Open this locker Heilmann rsquo s and you will get another datacube that turns out to be encrypted and a flat octagonal object with strange markings the text box in the upper left of your screen identifies it as an optical lens
You are now through in the Hub Site so take the tram down to the Base Camp on the edge of the Central Plains
The Central Plains The Base Camp Turn right to exit the tram
Ahead of you is some equipment and a table on which is a datacube and a note from Nicole ignore these as they are nothing but propaganda for a Clarke novel
Turn left to see another table on which is a tray labeled ldquo specimens rdquo and in which are two more tiles and a map panel
Take these and if you did bring Sabatini rsquo s lighter leave it in the tray
You can open the refrigerator but there is nothing available at this time
Use your computer Map function to see the Base Camp
Turn left or right twice and move toward the exit to the Central Plains
Rina Turgenyev will enter to get a coil of rope then deliver a mild tirade about capturing an alien after which she goes back out
Follow her out the exit and keep going until the Central Plains radar map appears
Central Plains Radar Map Reread what the game booklet has to say about this map on pages ndash and look at the radar map printout that accompanies this walk through
There are six permanent sites as shown though you can rsquo t get to all of them at this time
Many other locations will appear temporarily whenever you use this radar map to go between sites in the Central Plains
In these temporary sites you will find either biots or colleagues
The centipede biots will drop a matrix tile the first few times you encounter one for a maximum of three tiles back off from the other two biots as they will kill you
If you find another astronaut you may be presented with a piece of equipment or an artifact that you will need or you might get vital information
Or you may just get conversation
If you do get killed by a biot Arthur Clarke will appear for a lecture and you will then be given a chance for a retry
In fact it is interesting to get caught by a crab biot in order to see how that part of the RAMA trash disposal system works These non permanent sites are semi random in location and content so it is not possible to present a step by step walkthrough
Whenever you go to the radar map you probably should click on any of these that happen to be present in order to see what is there
If it is a fellow astronaut a white dot with a number will identify who it is
Be on the lookout for number Wakefield because he will give you a lens that you will need
If it is a centipede biot and you have already got three tiles from them ignore it
If it is a crab or spider biot click outside the enclosure area to move away and escape it
The first time you bring up the radar map a message from Dr Brown will briefly overlay it
When this fades check out the temporary sites
It is a good bet that one will be a centipede biot and you will get another matrix tile
Additional temporary sites probably will appear
When you have explored all of them go to the beam area number on the radar map printout
Beam Area I A schematic diagram of the beam area has been supplied
On it the relevant structures and artifacts are indicated the ldquo steering wheels rdquo represent the radar map access points
Each arrow segment is a forward step there are additional views at the ends of most of these and since they all have arrowheads at both ends you can go both ways
You can also get an outline view of the area and your location within it using your computer Map function
Using the diagram you can move around this site pretty much as you choose
At the trash biot you will encounter Reggie Wilson who will tell you about the RAMA trash collection system and the crab biots and give you datacube number showing these biots in action
Artifacts for you to collect matrix tiles map panels a lens and a red glass shard
A tile is embedded in the plastic cube and cannot be acquired at this time
The only reason to enter the biot shed now is to view the biots and have Puck identify them
The shark biot is something of a puzzle as it has no game function
The long massive tilted gray structure that you see when you first arrive is the beam
You never enter it and what its purpose is or was will remain a mystery
Return to the radar map
Wheel area I Make the usual check of all the temporary sites on the radar map as you should get another tile from a centipede biot
Next click on site number the wheel area
There you will find Sabatini who will give you a decryption card and then get called away
Click this card on your arm computer and you will be able to read the message from Heilmann to his assistants
The message is about the nuclear device
Again a schematic diagram for this area is provided and which may be compared with an area sketch obtained by using the computer Map function On the diagram note that a couple of the steps have arrowheads on only on one end
After you arrive you can only move to the trash biot and from there you can only exir the site or go right to an undistinguished spot near a hill
Before you do that however check the trash biot bin to see if there is a matrix tile in it
From this hillside spot move forward one step then look around
You should see what looks like an ear of corn ldquo seed rdquo sticking up from a cone and when looking back toward the trash biot a hard to see tile lying in a gray flat area to the right
Take the tile leave the seed
Move toward the ray cannon then turn right
You can see the corner of a biot that is behind a hill move to it
What this biot is or does we shall never know but it is obviously damaged as Puck will tell you
Turn right to find a tile in the ground on the side of the hill
Move toward the ray cannon and an avian will fly past you
Soon you will hear distressed squawking
Go back to the broken biot to find that the avian has somehow managed to get caught in it
No way to help it right now
Return to the ray cannon and then head for the ramp beyond it that leads up to the wheel structure
Go up the ramp you will see an opening in the base of the center structure with a spoke from the wheel perimeter leading to it
However when you go down the steps to the spoke a light flashes in the opening that enormous machine turns with lots of noise and the opening disappears
Turn left and move forward three steps clockwise around the wheel perimeter to the accompaniment of more noise then turn right to discover that the opening has reappeared
Cross on the spoke and enter the machine hub
On the floor is another tile and on the top of the central pillar is another that you cannot reach
Step up to the monitor in the pillar the right button produces nothing the left one shows another monitor somewhere with no action
Leave the hub and go back to the wheel perimeter
Turn right move two clockwise steps and you will be at the steps leading out
Leave the wheel and the wheel site and go to the radar map
Check the non permanent sites as usual maybe get anther tile from a centipede biot
Along about this stage of the game you should find Wakefield in one of the temp sites as you need a lens that he will give you
You should also check the Base Camp specimen tray and the refrigerator to see if an artifact has been left there
The next place to go is London number on the radar map
London At the London site for which there is a schematic diagram as there is for the first two sites you will see a large ornate building behind an irregularly pulsing force field Step forward once mdash but no more mdash and Takagishi will speak some brief nonsense to you and then leave
If you observe the force field for a short time you will note that among the pauses there is an extra long one and that it reoccurs after every ninth pulse
After noting one of these long pauses start counting pulses and when the ninth one stops move forward quickly to get beyond the force field
Turn left to face a pale green cubical pillar and pull the switch handle to turn off the force field
Note that on top of the pillar there is a small cube with a recessed triangular opening
Pick up the two yellow map segment panels and the matrix tile
Then turn around and go the building entrance
Click on the pillar to the right the one with the red icon on it
You will be brought close and a panel will slide down revealing your first matrix puzzle
In all the matrix puzzles the tiles have three distinguishing characteristics that change in an orderly progression as you move from left to right in the matrix and from top to bottom
This will be clear as you study the matrices
There are six gates in the game and six matrix puzzles
There are one or two tiles missing from each matrix puzzle and you are to find in your inventory the tiles that fit the matrix pattern progression you are allowed two tries to complete the matrix
If both fail the panel closes and you start over maybe with a different matrix maybe not
A puzzle cannot be used again in another location after it is solved because the tile s used to solve it is are no longer in inventory
For each correct solution tile there is usually another very similar one maybe more and the difference can be quite subtle
This first matrix puzzle is a simple one
For one thing there is only one missing tile and for anther there are only three tiles showing a pattern that is of a type to be the obvious fit it must be a pentagon of two colors lying on its side yellow on top and green on the bottom four dots white on top and black on the bottom
Consult the accompanying pages that show the thirty tiles pick out number from your inventory and click it in place in the matrix
You hear the rumble of the gate opening the panel rises to cover the matrix and you are shown the open gate
In the accompanying diagram pages a schematic details the London interior
Two accompanying pages show the six competed matrices but you are urged to try solving the matrix puzzles before resorting to these spoilers
The spoiler solution tiles are the ones with white squares in the corners
Obviously matrix represents the foregoing first matrix
Go through the open gate into an entry passage then through an archway to another passage
Here you will find on the floor at the right a tile and a yellow map panel turn around to find another yellow panel
Continue into London and you will be in the center of what the London interior diagram calls Tier
Ahead is another gate and pillar with an icon just like the entrance gate
Advance one step and retrieve the two map segment panels at the base of the matrix pillar then turn around and go back to the center of Tier
You are now facing the archway through which you entered
Pick up the matrix tile on the floor to the left then turn right and get another tile and the last of the twelve yellow map panels
You are looking at the RAMA animation display
Click on the controls at the center to get a closeup then press the violet cloverleaf to turn it on
Lots of things will appear
Press the yellow half disk to set the RAMA spacecraft in orbit when you do this you will hear panel opening noises that are the covers over the map bases behind you sliding back
Play with the rest of the controls for interesting effects but the reason for accessing these controls has been completed
Turn around and go to either of the two map bases and select map panels from inventory to place in a base and assemble a map then go to the other base and assemble the other map
There is a printout page showing the completed maps if you need it
The map of the Central Plains is of little use other than remove items from inventory but the map of New York island where you will eventually go shows three plazas and the passages that interconnect them
Also note the sided plaza shaped figure on the left end of this map it looks oddly like a face but that is irrelevant
You are finished in Tier
Go to the matrix pillar where you found the two map panels click on it and the cover slides down to reveal your second matrix puzzle
Examine it as before to establish the progression patterns and then place in it the tiles you think are the correct ones
Most likely though not for sure the puzzle to solve will be number on the puzzle solution sheet and the tiles needed are and
When you solve this matrix you can go though gate and another short passageway into Tier
Step forward to the wall and look down
This sludge pit is part of the RAMA trash disposal system and is where the material that has been placed by the crab biots into the trash biots goes
There is an elevator on the wall near the end of one of the three runways the one on the right
Look back up and turn around to face the tier entrance
Move one step toward the entrance and turn left
Move forward to the wall turn left again and move forward once
A mantis biot will come out of a door on the right and cross over to the pit shine a red light on a pillar and the pit elevator will rise
The mantis will get on the elevator shine the red light again and descend into the pit
Now you must do the same
Move forward and turn left to face the elevator control pillar and click on it
Click your right mouse button on your ISA multitool to get a closeup
Then click on the square white button until the light appears
Click on the red glass shard in inventory that you picked up near the biot shed in the beam area and it becomes attached to the tool so that the light is red
Put the tool back in inventory so you can pick it up now shining red and click it on the elevator call control
When the elevator comes up get on it and click the tool on the elevator control to descend
Leave the elevator and go down the ramp to the walkway
Pick out of the sludge any tiles that you see
Go out the walkway to where the three meet
Turn and go down another walkway to the wall and again pick out of the sludge any tiles you see
Do the same on the third walkway
On one of the walkways you can pick up a tile that is lying on it
A closeup of the tiles that you picked out of the sludge will show that they have some of it clinging to them and they must be cleaned before they can be used in a matrix puzzle
You should have found at least five tiles
Return to the elevator and go to the top of the pit
Exit the elevator and turn left whereupon you will faintly see a cube on the floor next to the rear wall
Go to and pick up this cube which the text box calls a biot box and get a closeup look at it
When you rotate it you will see on the back a triangular stud that will mate with the cube on the top of the force field switch
Return to the Tier entrance and keep going past it to the corner wall then turn right
In the bottom right corner of your screen is a matrix tile to be picked up
Move forward to the tubes on the floor where trash is coming in to the pit
Turn left for gate and its puzzle
Among the useable tiles in inventory you might have the ones needed to complete it
If you do fine enter Tier
If you don't put in any tiles until the panel rises when it comes back down after a moment's pause there will most likely be a different matrix and perhaps you have the tiles for this one
Repeat this process until the original matrix appears and if this happens you will know that for the present you do not have the correct tiles in inventory and you will have to leave London to find them
At this point this walkthrough will assume that you do have the tiles and that you rsquo ve solved the puzzle and opened the gate
If you don't have them and must leave to look for them this is the place in the walkthrough to return when you have found them
Go through the gate and short passageway and into Tier
If you can ignore the racket that the spider biot is making it is interesting to operate the three biot exhibits
Approach the spider biot beyond which you can see a video monitor and a medallion leaning against the wall on the floor below it
The text box refers to this medallion as an ldquo alien palette rdquo a rather strange appellation so that is what this walkthrough will also use to distinguish it from other medallions
Turn left go up the ramp turn right and get behind the pedestal
That device on the pedestal is a laser when you click on it the laser beam will activate the crane biot which will pick up the spider biot and hold it up and out of your way
You can now go to the monitor pull down the handle to turn it on and see in the display the monitor that you saw in the wheel hub pedestal
Again nothing is happening
Pick up the alien palette and get a closeup
If it were turned upside down it would be the plaza shaped figure that is on left end of the New York map that you assembled in Tier
In closeup you can clearly see four well defined patterns on it
You are through in London so head for the exit but before you can get out an agitated Nicole des Jardins rushes in to tell you Reggie Wilson has been trashed then leaves you with datacube number showing how it happened
Now you can leave
As you exit the building everything trembles as though an earthquake were occurring
A vidmail from Wakefield says that it was a RAMA course correction maneuver
Head for the gate power switch and when you get to it click the biot box on the triangular recess and it will open to furnish you with another matrix tile
Along about here there is a vidmail from Brown with a warning and instructions
Exit the London area via the radar map
Once again check out the temp sites
If you have not as yet got the lens from Wakefield you should now
Also when you check the Base Camp specimen box and the refrigerator you will find in the latter a box of powder on the back of which is a note saying that it was found in the wheel area
That is where you should go now
Wheel Area II The main reason for this visit is to clean the tiles found in the London trash pit
You still cannot do anything for the trapped Avian
The first thing to do is collect the seed then go to the still
When you are standing in front of the main unit if you ask Puck he will confirm that it is a distillation unit
In a pipe to the left is some sort of gear and on the right is a unit that resembles an old fashioned potbellied wood stove
Click on the main unit to get a closeup
Put the box of powder from the Base Camp refrigerator in the box of powder shaped opening
Put the seed in the star shaped opening to the right of the powder where it will slowly disappear
Click on the gear in the pipe on the left and from the gurgling noise it must be a valve not a gear
Back off then click on the stove shaped unit
You will see that there is a liquid gauge on the left and a basin with some blue material in it in front
Press the triangular pink button and the spout releases some fluid that washes away this material
The gauge now is down one unit
One by one put the tiles that have sludge on them in the tray and wash it off
But you still have one uncleaned tile let rsquo s hope it is not one of the critical ones
You could check the matrix solution pages and see
If it is or if you are a neat freak and just have to have it clean you will have to make more cleaning fluid
There is enough powder but you will need another seed
Go back to where you found the first one to see if there might be another
No
Duck out to the radar map fortunately there is a map access right near by and right back in and a seed will appear
Repeat the foregoing cleaning preparation process and you will have another five doses of cleaning fluid
Clean the last tile if you must
While you are here pay another visit to the wheel hub
You know the procedure
This time when you try the monitor the left button still shows another monitor which you now know is in London Tier
The previously blank right button now shows a mantis biot removing and discarding the gate in the beam area biot shed and allowing three spider biots to get out
Leave the wheel hub
One more thing if you have the lens from Wakefield
Go to the ray cannon and click on it for a closeup
A panel in the barrel opens to show three slots one for Wakefield rsquo s lens one for the lens you found by the biot shed and one for the lens from Heillmann rsquo s locker in the Hub Site
Insert these lenses in the slots and the cannon will turn fire a blast upward and return to its original position
If you still do not have Wakefield rsquo s lens this procedure will have to wait until you do Go to the radar map
Perform all the usual checks then go back to the beam area
Beam area II In the beam area go to the plastic cube
The blast from the ray cannon has shattered the plastic and you can pick up the matrix tile that was embedded in it
Then go to the biot shed and get the cage door that the mantis biot discarded
Return to the radar map
As usual make all the radar map area checks
You now have to contend with the quick and dangerous spider biots
You could investigate the Ice Port if you wish number on the radar map printout but you must now go to Bangkok number
Bangkok There is no schematic diagram for the exterior of Bangkok though the arm computer Map has an outline view because when you get there you advance straight ahead to the gate to solve the entrance matrix puzzle
However there is a diagram for the Tier interior including the Myrmicat and Octospider numbers that you will need shortly
The gate entrance is the same as the entrance gate to London in all the important details
Click on the pillar on the right with the red icon and you will be presented with the gate matrix puzzle most likely number on the matrix solution sheet
Even though there is only one tile missing this puzzle presents more of a challenge because it is more difficult to establish a progression with this particular style of tile pattern
The ldquo bristles rdquo on the little ldquo toothbrush rdquo can vary in number can be pointed in or out and can be on either end of the ldquo handle rdquo
The five squares along the bottom edge represent a base number system see the attached Primer to convert to decimal
The tile that fits is number on the tile illustration sheet the hard to see tile you found near the seed in the wheel area
Click this tile into the matrix to close the matrix cover and to be ready to enter Bangkok
Go through the gate and you will be in the anteroom to the first tier the Human Museum the entry gate to which is before you and it is locked of course
Humans use the decimal number system and on your right is a display illustrating this system
You don rsquo t need to have the decimal system explained to you of course but it is illustrative by being analogous to the octal and hexadecimal displays you will encounter on the other tiers
You should examine it and you can try a couple of numbers to see how it operates
Behind you along the opposite wall are three displays that provide some very elementary tests of your number comprehension
Turn around and click on the display on the left
You get a monitor a ndash keypad and an illuminated button with a figure of a man to indicate that this is the Human Museum
Accompanied by many strange noises the unit runs through an illustration of what is to be done after which the test begins a number is displayed you use the keypad to duplicate the number
Do this successfully five times and you pass
You can hardly lose because if you make a mistake you are given another number to try until you are correct five times after which the part of the unit immediately below is shown it resembles a phonograph turntable and pickup arm
Click on the arm so that it swings to the rear and a red light comes on
You hear the gate to Tier of the museum opening
Look up back off and click on the middle display
This time the exercise is merely counting the number of jewels that are displayed on the monitor
When there is more than one row there are per complete row
After five successful counts the view again shifts downward
As Punch tells you whatever was there has disintegrated nothing left but a red smear
Go to the third display
This time it is simple arithmetic addition and subtraction of integers
Take your time the unit beeps intermittently as it waits for your answer
Five successes and you look down to see a pink gem
Put it in your inventory
Proceed through the gate to Tier then look back to get another matrix tile that is on a ledge Go to the center of the Human Museum and look around
There are four bays showing eleven holographic exhibits most of them animated to some degree
Presumably they are to show an alien a few facets of human life they have no effect on the game
Where did the Ramans learn about them
Go into the vestibule opposite the gate through which you entered the museum
This vestibule is actually an elevator but the controls are covered
Click on the panel in the center on which is a familiar red icon
The panel slides down and here is the second Bangkok matrix puzzle
When you complete it and back off the elevator control button has been uncovered so press it to rise quickly and silently to the anteroom of the second tier the Myrmicat museum
This anteroom contains a set of displays just like the ones you ran through in the Human Museum downstairs but the number system is hexadecimal the one used by the Myrmicats and the Avians
If you have not yet read the short Primer on non decimal numbers please do so now this walkthrough will be here when you get back If you do not have the Windows scientific calculator running behind your game as discussed in the Primer save your game and set that up now
Turn right
Not surprisingly these aliens have their own set of symbols for their numerals and the right hand display illustrates them with the number of ldquo spheres rdquo going from to for the corresponding alien numerals
If in the center display you press the ndand rdbuttons for example the alien digits for and will show in the display and squares will light up being the decimal equivalent for hexadecimal
The left display is as downstairs three simple arithmetic calculations in hex note the alien symbols for and
Turn to the three displays on the wall behind you
Before you can begin on them Wakefield comes in from the elevator with a pep talk and why he thinks you are undergoing this testing
When he leaves click on the left display
The illuminated button indicates that this is the Myrmicat Museum and the keypad here has alien symbols but otherwise the equipment and procedures are the same as in the Human Museum below
When the gate opens back off and click on the middle display
Once again it is a matter of counting the gems in the display
Use the Alt Tab keys to bring up the calculator be sure calculator is in decimal mode key in the decimal number of gems that you just counted switch to hex use Alt Tab to return to the game and key in the hex number from the calculator
Make a mistake and you get to try again until you get five correct
When you look below you will find a medallion with a figure of a man on it
Put it in inventory and back off from the display
Get a closeup of the alien palette medallion that you got from behind the spider biot in London Tier on it one of the images is highlighted the one that has the same shape as the medallion you just got
This must have some significance
The third display is as before exercises in simple arithmetic
This time when you use the calculator you do not have to switch between decimal and hex just leave it in hex and do the calculations
Note in the example arithmetic the equivalent for shows as a solid hexagon but on the monitor for this third display it is an outline
Five correct calculations and you get another pink gem
Pass through the gate to the center of the Tier Museum
Once again four bays with holographic exhibits many of which show the examples corresponding to those in the Human Museum a chair globe helmet lamp guitar spaceship
In place of a man and a woman there is an Avian and a Myrmicat one wonders how far to take that analogy
Note the mural of the egg shaped object with the straps around it
From the animated display it appears to indeed be an egg a Myrmicat egg to be exact
There is one exceptional display instead of a hologram of a wire cutter this pedestal has a real one
Put it in your inventory
Now go to the elevator opposite the Tier entry gate which identical to the one in which you came up from Tier
Click on the icon to slide down the cover of the last matrix puzzle
When completed the elevator control button is accessible
Take the elevator up to Tier and you exit into the anteroom to the Octospider Museum
Here you again have the set of displays as on the other two tiers
Octospiders use an octal number system based on the visible color spectrum illustrated by the right hand display against the wall to your right
If in the center display you press the ndand rdbuttons as you did in the tier below the Octospider digits colors for and will show in the display and squares will light up being the decimal equivalent for octal
The left display is as in the other tiers three simple arithmetic calculations in octal note the Octospider symbols for and
As mentioned in page of the General Observations the color rendition of your computer can possibly cause some confusion and in addition to that the process of copying and printing the Octospider numerals on the Bangkok schematic diagram produces printed colors that are not necessarily true to those in the visible spectrum
Proceed with the displays on the other wall as you did in Tier using the calculator in its octal mode
The first display opens the museum gate from the second you get an Octospider medallion and from the third another pink gem
Check your alien palette medallion and there are now two figures highlighted
When you go to the center of the Tier Octospider Museum turn left to the display of a large Octospider and two smaller ones
On the floor below the left pillar is an indigo green jewel for your inventory
After you have looked at all the exhibits head for the exit
In the elevator where the tile matrix was when you came up there is now a triangle with a depression at each apex
Put the three pink gems in these depressions the triangle moves downward and you can pick up what the text box calls a number box
Now that you have gone through the decimal octal hexadecimal exercises you get a unit that gives all the equivalencies
Leave Bangkok and go to the radar map
At this stage of the game there is no longer much point in checking the base camp or the or the temporary map areas
Remember that stuck Avian
Go to the wheel area
Wheel Area III As soon as you get to the wheel area go to that imprisoned creature
Click on the opening in the base of the biot then use the clippers you got from the Myrmicat museum to cut the cable and stop the sparking
Back off and on the ground to the left of the biot find a bent rod
Click this rod on the biot arm holding the Avian to get it loose
The grateful Avian removes a ring from his neck and tosses it on the ground in front of him then indicates that you should take it
Do so and it flies away
Check your alien palette to find the center circle highlighted only one figure left that is not
It has the shape of a matrix tile
Now make one last trip to the wheel
When you get into the hub pick up the gate you got in the biot shed and click it on the central pedestal where it serves as a ladder
Click on this ladder and you can get the blank matrix tile in the holder on top of the pedestal
Now all of the figures on the alien palette are highlighted
Perhaps that means you are finished here
Leave the wheel area for the radar map and go to the Ice Port number on the radar map
Ice Port Search around a bit and you will encounter Dr Brown
He tells you that the ISA has given orders to evacuate RAMA in twelve hours but that O rsquo Toole Takagishi and Sabatini are out of touch on an island city that they have discovered in the frozen Circular Sea
Nicole then joins him and suggests that you and she go to the island and find them while he directs the evacuation preparation
He agrees and leaves first giving you a datacube from the three missing astronauts
Nicole says you should look around the Ice Port and that she will meet you at the icemobile
She leaves
Click the datacube on the arm computer to get the three messages
Go forward to the Ice Port
Look down and you will see the icemobile but if you go down to it you will not be able to get aboard
Instead look behind the structure to the right where you will find another unarmed nuclear device
Now when you go down to the icemobile you will find Nicole waiting
Click on the seat behind her to get in and after a CD change off you go to New York island
A long video ensues and you then dock below a ramp leading up the gates of New York New York Nicole says she wants to look around using the icemobile and suggests that you go on ahead
Go up the steps to the gate which is locked
Look to your left to see a panel with a plaza shaped depression in it
Recall the New York island map from London Tier
Click the alien palette medallion with the four highlighted shapes on this panel and you will hear the rumble of the opening gate
How did your three companions get in
Turn right to the open gate according to the compass you are facing west mdash according to the panel map in London Tier you should be facing east
Go through the gate and advance down the corridor four steps and you will find yourself in the center of a violet colored tiled circle near the center of the Avian Plaza
The compass indicates six different views around you and you can also look upward
Wander around and get the lay of the land maybe find some stuff
Check with your arm computer Map function and use Punch for some information
Incidentally you will hear various background noises while in New York you can ignore these
There is much to accomplish in this plaza but there are some preparatory actions to be done first
Refer to the New York Island corridor schematic diagram
You will see indicated three gates and five tuning forks
You need fork now fork later
However if you go through the plaza and into the corridor maze you will find the gates closed
The thing to do is open all the gates collect all the tuning forks and with those tasks out of the way you will be free to move about New York and operate in all three plazas
Avian Plaza I On the Avian Plaza schematic diagram you are at a reference point indicated by the smallxin the center of the violet tiled circle and facing the tetrahedron
Turn right twice and advance once and you are at the entrance to a passageway
Enter turn left and approach the apparatus that looks something like a lathe
This is the gate controller
There is one in every plaza but they are interconnected and you only have to deal with one and only once
Click on it then in the center depression place the blank tile you got from on top of the pillar in the wheel hub
The center light of the five in back comes on
Press the left pointing green arrow
The shaft moves left the next light comes on a tone is heard as is the sound of an opening gate
Press the arrow again the same things happen but the tone is higher in pitch
Press the right pointing green arrow and the reverse occurs
After you pass the neutral middle position you hear an even higher pitched tone and when you move the shaft all the way to the right you hear all three tones
All the gates are now open
Return to the reference point in the center of the circle facing the tetrahedron
Corridor Maze Now you will traverse the corridor maze collecting tuning forks
A couple of times you have to turn around to see them
Follow along on the corridor diagram because even though it appears simple it is easy to loose your place with the walls being so repetitious
The arm computer map function will be of tremendous assistance
From now on the directions will be abbreviated L ndash turn left R ndash turn right F ndash forward
From the reference pointxgo L F F and you will be at the entrance to the corridor maze
Go F R F F and you will be at the tee where the maze branches
Read the following paragraph right now then return here if you wish
Go L F R Pick up tuning fork
Go F F F F As you pass through the gate you will hear one of the tones you heard at the gate controller
Turn around and get tuning fork
Turn around again to continue F as before to the angle of the corridor
Go R F and you will be at another tee
Going left takes you to the Human Plaza but right now you want to go R F L F R and get tuning fork
Go F F F again hearing a tone as you pass through the gate
Go L F R Now look R back toward the way you came and get tuning fork
Turn L to face the way you have been going
Then go F F and stop before the third gate
Go R F R and get tuning fork
You can get a glimpse of the Octospider Plaza ahead but that is for later
Go R F R F F through the gate then R F F L F F L F back to the Avian Plaza
Go F F L L and you are back at reference pointxwith the five tuning forks in inventory
The forks are identified by the number of red stripes on the handles
There is a somewhat simpler alternative since you only need two of the five tuning forks
Follow the above steps ignoring fork until you pick up fork
Then instead of turning and continuing forward return to the reference pointxin the Avian Plaza
When you eventually go to the Octospider Plaza pick up fork that you will use later in the Human Plaza
Leave the other forks in the corridor whenever you pass them and you will have less extraneous stuff in your inventory
Avian Plaza II In this walkthrough you will be directed to the several locations to which you must go in this plaza by starting from reference pointx You can of course go from location to location without returning to the reference but it will be easier to describe your movements by starting fromx
The reference includes facing the tetrahedron
This paragraph directs you to the yellow filter but since it is not used it is probably better to ignore it to keep the inventory less cluttered
Go L L F L to get to the yellow filter pick it off the ledge by the wall
Return tox
Go L F F to the maze entrance then turn L and move F In front of you is a large blue and gold structure on a very low platform
Click Puck on it to get his evaluation
Not a necessary trip but informative
Return to the reference
Go R F R F F F to see a mural or poster showing that belted egg that was featured in the Myrmicat Museum
It must have some significance
Again not necessary but informative
Return to the reference
Move F toward the tetrahedron
Steps go up to a platform with statues on either side on the left an Avian on the right a Myrmicat
Go up to stand on the platform
You can get close to the tetrahedron but that is about all
Turn to the Avian statue
It has a red ring around its neck and a groove for another
When you freed the Avian from the damaged biot it gave you one such ring put it on the statue
When you do a handle appears on the tetrahedron to the left of the large triangle
But you can rsquo t reach it
Return to the reference
Go R F F to get to the sawtooth gold column
On the ledge behind it you can see a row of avian perches one appears to be missing
Turn R to see a ramp leading up to the center portal of five on an arc up on the wall only the leftmost one is open
Go F to the base of the ramp then turn R and click on the square purple frame to get a closeup
Click tuning fork in the fork shaped depression
The ramp shifts to the right one portal
Click the fork in the frame five more times and the ramp will shift right again then reverse direction and move to the open portal
Back off turn R R and go up the ramp and all the way into the room at the top
Turn left and go to the window and you can see the row of avian perches the missing one is in back overturned
Back off and turn L to face the room entrance
On the floor to the right is an object that looks like a hydraulic jack lying on its side and in fact that is what it is
Pick it up
Leave the room and go to the gold column
Click on the column base then place the jack there and click on it to push the jack rod up and tip the column backward to land on the ledge with the perches
You can now go up the tilted column to the ledge and get the overturned perch
Go back down the column and return to the reference point
Go up the steps in front of the tetrahedron and place the perch on the platform and you can now reach the handle click on it for a closeup then again to turn it
The large triangle falls away to reveal a passageway into the tetrahedron
When you enter you will find a control panel with a knob a slider a plunger and a monitor
Push down the plunger in the center to turn the unit on
Turn the knob on the left to change the display stop when the monitor shows the banded egg that has been so prominent
Move the slider down to show a red grid to lock in the monitor display
Sounds of heavy movement are heard
Leave the tetrahedron
From the reference point go L F F L F to find that the large blue and gold structure has tilted back to reveal an opening in the floor covered by a heavy plate with some recessed geometric figures but there is nothing in inventory that will fit them
This is the entrance to the Avian lair
Each of the plazas has a lair and each is an adventure in itself
In this lair you will meet Avians in the Octospider lair you will meet Octospiders but the only human in the Human lair will be yourself
Since you cannot now get into the Avian lair you may as well explore the Octospider Plaza
Enter the maze and go there
If you have not as yet got tuning fork pick it up on your way into the plaza
Octospider Plaza I Wander around and get the lay of the land maybe find some stuff
Check with your arm computer map function and use Punch for some information
As in the Avian Plaza if you consult the schematic diagram for the Octospider Plaza you will find anxmarking a reference point from which will be given the moves to the locations where you need to go
In this plaza the reference is the spot in which you find yourself immediately after you exit the corridor leading to the plaza
To find your way back to it go to the central plaza area and look for the corridor in the surrounding skyscrapers that tower above the plaza buildings
Also as in the Avian Plaza there is a structure with triangular sides which Punch will tell you is an octahedron
Take care of the small things first From the reference go L F L and get the indigo yellow I Y jewel lying on the floor
From the reference go F R F F L and get the green G G jewel that is on the floor in the lower right corner of the screen
From pointxgo F R F F R F to get the blue filter that is lying on the floor
From the reference go F L F F L F to find a camera
Get a closeup of the camera then turn it to see the rear
Remove the red datacube from the camera and click it on the arm computer to see a short video that Takagishi took of some Octospiders
This action will not help the game but it is mildly informative at this point
Return to the reference
Time to check out the octahedron
Point your movement cursor directly at it go F R to be looking at its front which is remarkably similar to the tetrahedron in the Avian Plaza with steps and platform large triangular entrance and an unlocking device on the left about which Puck has a comment
Now from the reference go L F R F R and you will be at the entrance to the artifact museum
When you enter the museum you will find nine tables around the sides of the room each table with an artifact mounted on it
From each table there extends an arm topped with a bicolored diamond shaped panel in the center of which is a diamond shaped depression into which a jewel may be placed with the colors on the panel indicating which jewel to use
Presumably a successful match will release the artifact on the table
After you examine all the artifacts you can conclude that you would have no use for most of them assuming that you could release them
You no longer need a map panel a matrix tile a cleaning fluid seed another wire clipper or blue filter
Nor do you need a Y R jewel though you could use it in the Octospider lair if you had the B Y jewel to release it
The latter will be found in the Human Plaza
As it is only one of the three jewels you have will fit any of the panels the G G one
Use it to get what Puck tells you is an anniversary photo of the O rsquo Tooles How did the aliens get that
There is important code on the back
You get to keep the jewel
There is one other artifact you need the prism on the table at the end of the room but you have no Y O jewel to fit
Remove the red shard from your ISA multitool then shine the tool on the prism which sends a spectrum onto the panel on the arm
You need the yellow orange portion of the spectrum to hit the panel
The prism can be turned by clicking on the small round mirrors around the edge of the table
Turn the prism and shine the light on it
Repeat until the right part of the spectrum strikes the panel and the prism will be released and fall to the table
Put it in your inventory then leave the museum and go to the front of the octahedron
Get a closeup of the lock put the prism in the triangular opening on the top and shine your multitool on it
The triangular door will fall away and you may enter the octahedron
When you go in you are confronted with a color matching puzzle
Save your game
Activate the unit by clicking on the square red button
The three gray screens go black
On the right is a position slider switch the top position controls the right screen the middle position controls the middle screen and the bottom position controls the left screen
The three sliders on the left are color blenders the left for red the middle for green and the right for blue
The idea is to position the sliders so that the screen color matches that of the small square above it when you achieve this a red X is laid across the screen and you then move the right hand slide switch and repeat for another screen
When all three matches have been made you will clearly hear the sound of mechanical movement
It really isn't very hard
Hint start with the left screen and move the right slider
If you get frustrated there is a page attached showing the solutions
Return to the reference point
Go F L F F R F L A large wall panel has moved aside revealing a circular gate with a hexagonal panel on the left
The gate is the entrance to the Octospider lair
Click on the hexagonal panel for a closeup
The Octospider medallion that you got from one of the base devices in Bangkok will fit the lower depression but you do not as yet have anything to fit the triangular upper one
You have done all and acquired everything here that you can for now so leave through the maze and go to the Human Plaza
Human Plaza I When you get to the Human Plaza if you ask Puck he will tell you that this place seems deserted but after all the astronaut crew are the only humans on RAMA
It is also rather colorless compared to the other two plazas
Wander around and get a feel for your surroundings maybe find some stuff
Check with your arm computer Map function and use Punch for some information
The computer map shows an uncluttered plaza but there is a circular subway about the size of the plaza off to one side
Again the reference pointxis where you are just after you leave the corridor into this plaza
Fromxmove F F and you will be at the entrance to the gate controller passageway
Enter the passageway turn R and get the G R jewel from the floor
Fromxmove F R F and get the B Y jewel from the floor
As explained above you can use this jewel back in the Octospider artifact museum to get a Y R jewel that you can use but don rsquo t require your choice
From the reference point go R F F and you will be as close to the Human lair entrance as you can get separated from it by what Puck calls a crevice
You can peer down into it but you can rsquo t see the bottom
Fromxgo F L F and you will be standing before a set of steps leading up to a triangular door in yet another structure with a triangular face
Puck says it is a pyramid
It is like the ones in the other plazas but it does not have the unlocking panel
Turn R and click on the statue you see on a pedestal
The closeup will show a tuning fork shaped depression in the statue
Click tuning fork on the depression and you will hear a noise behind you
Turn around and see the triangular door in the pyramid open and a mantis biot come out
It goes to a door in the wall opposite you and shines a blue light on a pedestal
The door opens and the biot goes through
The door closes
You can do that
Recall your experience with the London trash pit elevator
Turn on the ISA multitool light and affix the blue filter to it
Go over to the door then click the tool on the window at the top of the pedestal and when the gate opens go through
Unlike for the biot for you the gate remains open
You are now in the entrance to the circular subway that you saw in the computer map
Click on the blue human shaped seat this will put you in it looking toward the open gate
On your right is a panel with a large square red button below which is a more or less star shaped indicator with yellow lights on each point
One of these is lit
The map shows five stations on the subway and that you are at one of them so it is a pretty fair inference that the lights are station indicators and that the lit one is the entrance where you now sit
Call that one No and the others through moving CCW
Click on the red button
The door closes and lights flash by the windows in the door showing you moving to the left however the computer map and the star indicator say that you have gone to the right to station No
Designer goof
When the door opens take two steps out
To your right is a display console showing nine blue bars of increasing size mdash this is supposed to indicate to you that you are to do some manipulation in the same manner
Turn right to observe a horizontal row of nine blank monitors below which is a vertical row of three with pictures
For now don rsquo t do anything but make a note of the picture contents a seal an eagle and some microscopic protozoa
Return to the blue subway seat and click the red button to go to station No
Get out to find a duplicate to station No but this time the monitors show a frog an ant and cat
On to station No
This time when the door slides back there is another door that won rsquo t open
Go to station No which is a duplicate of and
The monitors show a snail a cow and an elephant
Now you have gone to all to the stops and have seen nine pictures of animals of varying sizes
Listing them by size as might be indicated by the nine blue bars protozoa ant snail frog cat eagle seal cow elephant Click on monitor No in the horizontal row and the snail picture transfers to it
Do the same for monitor No and then No
to transfer the cow and elephant pictures
You see how it goes
Go to stations and and make the same transfers to fill the horizontal monitor row with pictures of animals of increasing size according to the above list
Now when you go to station No the formerly closed door is open and there is another blue seat beyond it
Go sit in it
The computer Map indicates this is a branch line that goes to the Human lair
You have the same sort of control panel but no star shaped station indicator
Click on the red button
A short ride and you can enter a rather small chamber with hydraulic machinery on the right and a pedestal with a yellow button in the center
Nothing to do but push the button producing hydraulic commotion after which you can initiate no more activity
Get back in the blue seat and push the red button to ride back to station No
Transfer seats and go to station No
Leave the subway and go back into the Human Plaza
Now the gate closes
Wonder what happened to that mantis biot
Go to the reference pointx then R F F to the lair entrance
The hydraulic activity has raised a bridge across the crevice so you can now get to the lair gate
Click on the hexagonal panel on the left
The human medallion from the Bangkok testing device will snap onto the depressions on the right in this panel but as with the Octospider lair gate you have nothing to fit the triangle on the left
Have to look further
Go back to the Avian Plaza
Avian Plaza III From the referencexgo L F F L F to the Avian lair
Follow that Avian
As you approach you find that the heavy cover is now gone and you see an Avian entering
When you get to the lair and look down you can see the Avian in a passageway opening on the side
It flies across the shaft and disappears
The lair is a shaft mdash Puck tells you it is a quarter mile deep mdash with several passageways on opposite sides of the shaft
You can see a couple of these passageways and looking closely you can see the ledges that allow you to move up and down the shaft
As you watch ledges slowly extend allowing you to climb down
Avian Lair A schematic diagram of the Avian lair is provided use of this diagram in conjunction with the arm computer Map function and its white locator dot will help keep track of the ever changing location in this largely vertical environment and as usual Puck is a source of much information when queried
Avians use the Myrmicat hexadecimal numbering system and symbols that you encountered in Bangkok
In order to move vertically up and down the shaft you must be facing the shaft not the doors or passageways leading to the various chambers
Levels are indicated by small lights above or below the doorways The sides of the shaft are arbitrarily labeled north and south for reference From the Avian Plaza Enter the Avian lair you will then be on N side of the shaft at level
Ledges used to climb down have retracted which may be verified by looking upward
There is no way out until a way can be found to extend them
Go down one level
Level N Enter the audience chamber
Go to the Avian in the center of the room by the apparatus that turns out to be a melon dispenser accept the melon he offers
Click the ISA multitool knife on the melon to cut it in half then click the multitool spoon on one of the halves to eat it which produces a temporary expanded vision effect that allows you to see additional writing on the walls
Give other melon half to the Avian who will take a couple bites and fly to the back of the chamber
Follow the Avian to the bottom of elevator
Click on the elevator mechanism to ride up
At the top accept the quot Avian gift quot according to the text box from the officials this is an acoustic number generator in Avian squawking language
Turn and view the assembled Avians turn back to the officials and you will automatically descend the elevator
Go past the melon dispenser toward the exit
Turn around and operate the dispenser to get at least one melon two might be better
Exit the audience hall to the shaft
Go down level to the theater
Level N Enter the theater follow the performers backstage
Get the quot costume pendant quot according to the text box from the Octospider costume on the rack
This pyramid is the Octospider lair key
Ignoring the squawking Avian actor return to the stage area
Get the non burning oil filled gourd lamp from the stage
Exit the theater to the shaft
Get a closeup of the stuck turnstile mechanism at bottom of the theater entrance
An attempt to turn it will demonstrate that after a little turning it is indeed stuck
Pour oil from the gourd lamp on the mechanism to free it
Click on the mechanism to extend the ramp to the south side of the shaft
Cross the ramp
Go up level to the hatchery
Level S Enter the hatchery
Examine this room if you wish
Go around the central pillar to the back of the room and locate the overhead perch array that resembles a jungle gym
To get up is not real easy you can see the array but you must have an exact view to ascend
Look near a wall for a single pipe hanging down over a bucket then move forward and look up
Grab an overhead pipe
Climb the array to the room near the ceiling
Get the cable and climb back down
Exit the hatchery
Go down levels to the schoolroom
Level S Enter the schoolroom
Examine this room if you wish
Turn around and note the Myrmicat hexadecimal number symbols or their decimal equivalents over the entrance
Exit the schoolroom
Go up level cross the ramp to the north side of shaft and go up levels to Security
Level N Go down the passage to the door with the green porthole note the decimal numbers equivalent to the hexadecimal symbols over the door
Optional to hear examples of the Avian squawks for equivalent number symbols turn around take one step turn right enter room with a liquid filled vat below a display board and throw switch on left wall this will start demonstration
Leave when you are satisfied and return to the door with the green window
Place the quot Avian gift quot number generator on the black bar below the window
Click on the disks that are the numbers of step
The door opens
Go to the console
Move the knob on the left to position to activate the monitor
Use the keypad to enter the number symbols of step for the schoolroom the monitor now shows the schoolroom
Move the slider switch on the right side of the console to the bottom position in order to extend the steps on the schoolroom podium may be observed on the monitor
Exit Security room as in steps and
Go down levels cross the ramp to the south side of the shaft and go down level to the schoolroom
Level S Enter the schoolroom and go to the right around the podium to the steps leading to the top as seen on the Security monitor
Ascend the podium and turn right to the elevator
The elevator does not work so use the cable that you got in the hatchery to go down the elevator shaft to enter the ruined Myrmicat domain
Go right and enter the fire gutted room
Turn around and pick up the pottery bowl
Return along the passageway past the elevator shaft to the plaza with three pools one empty and two filled with a caustic liquid
This room was seen when you first turned on the monitor in Security
Go around the perimeter of the plaza and observe that there is a small pyramid on the pedestal in the center of one of the filled pools
Fill the pottery bowl with liquid from one of the pools
Go around the room perimeter to the ramp leading to the control device in the center of the plaza
Go up the ramp to the control
Pour the liquid from the bowl that you just filled onto the base of the upright shaft in order to wash away material coated there and thus free the shaft
Click on the upright shaft to lower it to a horizontal position
Click twice on the control so that it points to the pool with the pyramid
Lift the red knob on the control rim opposite the pointer
Press the red button in the center of the control in order to drain the pool
Go pick up the pyramid
This is the Human lair key referred to in the text box as the quot pool pendant quot
Return to elevator shaft and click on the cable to climb out
Descend the two sets of steps down from the podium and go to a position just past that goofy looking spherical projector
Observe the large mural on the wall just to the right of the entrance it represents the shaft access ledges retracted
Move past the projector and look at the end mural it shows the ledges extended
Eat a melon half
Under expanded vision note the Myrmicat hexadecimal number symbols or their decimal equivalents that appear at the top of the end mural ledges extended
Exit the schoolroom
Go up levels to the hatchery
Level S Enter the hatchery and go around to the back of the large central pillar to access the control panel in the base of the pillar
Put the Human lair key pyramid quot pool pendant quot on the red triangle below the gold sphere
Do the same with the Octospider lair key pyramid quot costume pendant quot Pick up the magnetic security card when the Octospider door opens
Exit the hatchery
Go down level cross the ramp to the north side and up levels to Security
Level S Enter Security room using the audio number generator as before
Move to the elevator on the right get decimal numbers equivalent to hexadecimal symbols above the elevator
Move to the elevator and look down
Place the audio number generator on the elevator controls
Enter the numbers of step and ride up
Turn around and go to the controls and display monitor at the end of the room
Insert the magnetic security card in the slot
Use the keypad to enter the number symbols of step
The monitor on the left should show that the shelves have extended
Return to the elevator and use the audio number generator to go back down to the Security room
Exit the Security room to the lair shaft
Climb out to the Avian Plaza on the now extended topmost set of lair shaft ledges
As soon as you leave the Avian lair you encounter Wakefield who has been looking for you
It seems that Heilmann has set three atomic devices to go off in six hours
Two you have seen and there is one here somewhere in New York
It must be deactivated and all three will be harmless
While he is talking RAMA undergoes another course correction so that it is no longer on a collision course with earth
Wakefield takes off but he leaves you Falstaff who has been fitted with a camera that works through your arm computer
Go through the maze to the Octospider Plaza
Octospider Plaza II When you get to the Octospider Plaza if you have picked up the B Y jewel from the Human Plaza and want the Y R jewel from the Artifact Museum that is where you should go now
Enter the museum and go to the table with the Y R jewel use the B Y jewel to release it put it in your inventory and return to the reference point
If don rsquo t want the Y R jewel when you get to the plaza go directly to the reference point
From the reference pointxgo F L F F R F L to the Octospider lair
Click on the hexagonal panel to the left of the gate where you previously put the Octospider medallion and which is still there
Put he Octospider lair key ldquo costume pendant rdquo in the triangular depression and you hear the sounds of the gate opening
Back off to see that this indeed the case
Octospider Lair There is a schematic diagram of the Octospider lair that may be used along with the arm computer Map function to help keep track of the ever changing location in this sometimes vertical environment with its multiple passageways
Gates are opened by applying an ap propriately colored jewel which then automatically returns to inventory and the gates remain open
Remember the atomic clock is ticking
Use the arm computer right click function to keep an eye on the time remaining until bomb detonation
From the Octospider Plaza Enter Octospider lair proceed down the ramps to the center of the rotunda
Punch calls this room an atrium
A slight vertical movement will be noticed and heard upon stepping off the ramp onto the circular platform at the center of the room
Locate the open gate on the rotunda perimeter this is the North gate check the compass
Enter the gate and go down the passage to the fountain room
Enter the fountain room the two octospiders who are dancing in the room leave by an open gate behind them that then closes and which you cannot open since you do not have an O G jewel
Go to the coat on the floor extract and listen to datacubes
Go to the set of four white switches near the floor
Press any or all of the switches including the colored ones and observe the results
When you press the third white switch sounds of something opening will be heard
Go to the now accessible jewel cabinet on the wall use I Y jewel to open it
Remove the V B and O R jewels and place them in inventory
The other jewels in the cabinet are duplicates
Release the rdwhite switch to turn off the fountain
Go to the closed O G gate through which the octospiders left
Move the cursor on the lower left part of the gate until it turns into a hand then click the left mouse button to see an out of reach O B jewel through the latticework
Place Falstaff on the jewel and he will get it and put it in your inventory
Return to the rotunda to find that the N gate is now closed
Use the just retrieved O B jewel to open it
Go to the platform in the center of rotunda it will again move downward
Look up andnote the colorsof the adjacent squares by the pink spikes at the o'clock position this is a number in octospider octal color notation and changes randomly each time you step on the platform
Continue straight across rotunda to the S gate and open it with the I G jewel
Traverse the long steps passageway to V B gate
Optional explore the gallery to the left of this gate many very interesting ex hibits
If you do this be sure and get Punch rsquo s comments
Also remember the clock is ticking
Note that the gate opposite the gallery entrance has a blank jewel image
The large disk with the many decimal octal and symbol hex numbers provides a hint for setting a similar adjustable disk that will be encountered later
Return to the V B gate
Use V B jewel to open the gate and move ahead steps until stopped by a wall in area with a gray and blue striped floor this is the spike pit room
Turn left once and view the two entrances
The one on the left is the one you just entered
Turn around and go to the spike pit observing and hearing that the spikes retract as you approach and step on the low purple platform that surrounds the pit
Look down if you wish
Turn around again and exit through the right entranceway seen in step
You will hear the spikes extend as you step off the platform as you move away
You will come to a G R gate that you then open with a G R jewel
Go through the gate and turn left to view the abacus device
Approach abacus and observe representations of the spike pit spikes extended and the color wheel of the rotunda dome
Press the gray button to change the display to columns of black bars
Use the cursor to light up the decimal number of bars corresponding to the octal number of step
The lair schematic includes an octal decimal conversion table for convenience
Press the gray button again to change the display back to spike pit and dome color wheel which should now show the spikes retracted and the color wheel as seen in step
Return to the spike pit the spikes again shift positions as you approach this time extending since you have set them retracted
Climb down the now extended spikes to the lair lower level
Move to the next room with the circular violet floor
As you step off the platform below the spike pit the spikes may be heard retracting As you move into the adjacent circular room the floor moves down and the spikes extend
Turn right and observe on the wall the diagram of the lair upper level
Approach the diagram and press the square gray button the image of the jewel begins flashing R O
Return to the center of the room and look up to see another color wheel like the one in the rotunda
Again note the color combination of the squares in the o'clock position
Go to a position below the spike pit
The spikes will be retracted
Approach the lower level abacus and repeat steps and using the octal color numbers just noted not that of step
When you now step below the spike pit the spikes will extend
Climb up the now extended spikes to the lair upper level
Exit the spike pit room through the left archway advance one step turn right and enter the gallery
Cross the gallery to the gate with formerly blank jewel image that is now R O Use the R O jewel to open gate
Advance into the quot laboratory quot in which there is a teaching octospider with several pieces of equipment in front of him or her
After he or she has finished his or her number illustrating performance and is waiting for a reply place the cursor on the left side of the top of the color number column and click once
The column will noisily rotate a quarter turn
Point to the rectangle second from the bottom violet for the octospider number seen on the transparent panel
The octospider cheers hands you a card O'Toole's catechism card and leaves by a gate behind him or her for which you have no jewel
The octospiders don rsquo t seem to need jewels to open gates mdash why is that
Perhaps they project colors from that ring that rotates around their heads
Take the gold colored rectangle from the top of the column
This is a plate giving the first numbers in O'Tooles quadratic prime number series n n
The Octospider has eaten one of the two quot organic lumps quot text box appellation from the dish on the floor
Take the remaining one
Return to the spike pit and go to the lair lower level
Go through the room containing the upper level diagram and into the end room with the large and small subway entrances
The large subway is inoperative
Go to the small subway and place the organic lump in the entrance
Place Falstaff in the subway entrance
After he climbs in your view changes to that which he sees and is relayed to you via the camera with which Wakefield has equipped him
The inventory now shows empty because Falstaff has taken over and it is his inventory that is displayed
When the view changes to Falstaff rsquo s the lump is on the subway floor
Put it in inventory as the sole item
Press the white button to travel to the nursery
Step out of the subway into nursery in which there are three feeding baby octomorphs
A very large tentacle removes food from the bowl on right and the octomorph throws a tantrum and leaves parking itself in front of O rsquo Toole rsquo s ID card so that you can rsquo t get to it
So the baby won't be in your way entice it back by placing the lump in its dish
Get O'Toole's ID card from the wall
Go to the opposite wall and get the hand laser
Return to the subway and press the white button to travel back to the lair lower level
Your inventory returns and now the laser and O rsquo Toole rsquo s card are included in it
Proceed to the spike pit
When in the room with color wheel look up and note the spike setting code
Use the code on the abacus as done previously to retract spikes
Go to the bottom of the spike pit and climb to the upper level after the spikes extend
If you got the Y R jewel from the Octospider artifact museum you can leave the spike room using either of the two exits if you don rsquo t have this jewel use the left archway and return to the rotunda
Go up the ramp and exit the octospider lair
As the group rsquo s codemaster O rsquo Toole set up the atomic devices arming and disarming code sequences though it was Heilmann who used them
Now that you have O rsquo Toole rsquo s ID card catechism card and anniversary picture all have a reference to quot code quot and the prime number series listing you have sufficient information to disarm the atomic device when you find it
That rsquo s what you have to do find the bomb
Go to the Human Plaza
Human Plaza II From the Human Plaza reference go R F F F to the Human lair and put the human lair key ldquo pool pendant rdquo in the triangular depression in the hexagonal panel to the left of the lair gate
The gate opens noisily
Enter and go down the steps to be confronted with a disk of numbers similar to the one in the Octospider Lair gallery
In the latter the decimal and hex numbers in the o rsquo clock position are of a different color than those in the rest of the rings which would seem to be significant furthermore upon getting decimal equivalents for these octal and hex numbers they are all the same number
If you get equivalent numbers for those hex and octal numbers on the disk now confronting you the only common number in all three systems is
The rings on this disk may be rotated line up all the rsquo s at the o rsquo clock pointer and the disk moves aside you have found the atomic device
Go through the opening only to encounter another confrontation
This time it is a spider biot that will not allow you access to the device no matter where you move
Recall how you used a laser on the crane biot to take care of the spider biot in London Tier
Fortunately there a crane biot here and even more fortunately you have a laser in inventory
Move so that you can see the crane biot in the mirror on the opposite wall then click on it with your hand laser and the crane biot will pick up the spider biot and hold it out of your way
Now you can move up to the device which is armed and ticking away the countdown
Depending upon how much time is left you may want to save your game
You must key in the deactivation code which will be the last puzzle of the game
You can see on the device that it is a digit code actually five digit numbers based on O rsquo Toole rsquo s prime number series and someone has already input digits
Let rsquo s assume these digits are correct
The back of O rsquo Toole rsquo s catechism card gives you this His ID card has the numbers and circled and on the back of his anniversary photo the number or or or see below is circled
These numbers represent n in the prime number series as shown on the gold series card
The numbers and are invariant both in value and position so you know the first and last group of four digits in the disarming code and
The ID numbers and are also fixed in value since they are part of his DOB
His anniversary date however seems fuzzy what adult male can remember anniversaries
since it can vary from to it is randomly set for each new game
Call it x
So and x will give the middle three digit groups but the sequence of these will groups also are set randomly each game
Thus the middle three can be x x x x x x When you get the series numbers for the n values of and x the order can be deduced from the four digits that are already showing on the device
Since x can be any of four numbers a generalized set of rules cannot be presented
A specific example follows with x being and the digit number in places already in the digit code being
Based in the numbers for n of and the series numbers for the code are and
To start with you have from which it is clear must be in the second place and in the third place leaving in the fourth
Therefore the disarming code is Enter this number
As you start to key the last digit a yellow INPUTnnndisplay comes on the three squares indicating that you have three tries to get the correct code
When code entry is complete click on the yellow display
If the code is incorrect one square turns red
Should you fail twice more lights flash a klaxon sounds and you get a view of RAMA disintegrating in space
With the correct code entry the NOT ARMED display is shown and all goes quiet
Back off and you get a vidmail from Nicole telling you to ldquo Get up here rdquo
Do so and watch a luminescence display with her and Wakefield followed by a concluding lecture from Arthur Clarke

However in the computer world systems using a base other than are used primarily binary or base and extensions of that
No matter what the system thepositionof a digit within a number determines the value it contributes for example the base number represents an implied addition problem x x x x The subscript indicates that that the number is base
The rightmost digit always representing ones i e and the value used to multiply each digit increases by a factor of as you move each position to the left
This use of the base to distinguish the role of each digit in a number is the key to understanding arithmetic in all bases
For example the same sequence of digits in base octal would translate to x x x x Again note that the value multiplied by each digit increases by a factor of the base as you move each position to the left
These multipliers are referred to aspowersof the base for example Base Base x x x x x x etc etc
As seen in the conversion above it's fairly easy to translate a non decimal number into base but the opposite conversion is a bit trickier
The procedure can best be illustrated by means of a specific problem for example converting the decimal number into base
First we begin by finding the largest power of the base present in the starting number
Since x x x is larger than we next try x x whichdoesfactor at least once into x remainder In fact multiples of can be found in or so then becomes the first digit in the base equivalent number
The next base digit is found by repeating the same mathematics on the remainder which is
ndash The highest power of that that will factor into is or which will factor in only once and x remainder Continuing the process eventually results in the definition of all base digits x x x x h Any single digit in a number can never be as large as the base the maximum digit in a decimal number is and the maximum in a base number is
For baseslargerthan we must introduce other symbols for values above letters are usually the convention
In base hexadecimal we have the possible digits A B C D E F base base For example the number C is equivalent to and
Unless you have a translating calculator or other aid it's usually easiest to solve complex arithmetic problems in non decimal bases by first converting all numbers to base performing the arithmetic then converting the answer back to the desired base
For simple addition problems an analog of the decimal columnar method may be used for example in base lt carry digit Here are some examples of arithmetic problems in various bases Base Decimal Equivalent Base Decimal Equivalent Base Decimal Equivalent A E D B FF AA F A F CF Another way to get number equivalency is from a table of equivalents
Such a table for base numbers is on the last page of this document
A table is convenient if you have many numbers to work with and it can be readily constructed if the numbers are not large though it is somewhat more tedious for larger base numbers
Tables may be found in mathematical references or if you are computer adept you can have your computer make a table
The system used universally in digital computers is base or bi nary in which there are only two digits and because this is the way to reliability the signal representing the number is either there or it is not and since there is no level in between ambiguity is eliminated though at the expense of many more digits
For instance the digit decimal number is the digit number in binary
The binary numbers are at the fundamental level of computer manipulation and are hidden from the operator by several layers of software so that the familiar alphanumeric operations may be employed
Examination of the accompanying short binary number table will indicate the natural selection of octal and hexadecimal systems binary digits will represent all the octal digits and binary digits will represent all the hexadecimal digits
The above decimal number is in octal and EB in hex
Divide the binary number into groups of and it readily converts to and
Divide the binary number into groups of and convert E and B
The reverse conversion is just as easy
Another example is C Finally it should be emphasized that all the above discussion has been restricted tointegers
The conversion of fractions decimals can be and is done but the results though close depending upon the number of digits are not exact

To convert between Binary Octal and Hexadecimal systems it will be easier if you understand our Base system first as follows BASE Use the number Base
Starting at the DECIMAL point from here on the DECIMAL point will be referred to as the BASE point
Going from the Base point to the left the first space is referred to as UNITS In Base it equals five units
The next digit to the left is referred to as the X BASE The is four times the Base or
The next digit to the left is referred to as X BASE SQUARED or The is times or
The next digit to the left is referred to as X BASE TO THE THIRD POWER or
The next digit to the left is referred to as X BASE TO THE FOURTH POWER or
So as you continue to the left increase the power by one
Going from the BASE point to the RIGHT the first space s referred to as over Base
Or in this case one tenth So the would equal or two tenths
The next position to the right is one over Base squared the next would be Base to the third power and so on
BINARY BASE The Binary base system is the same as above in Base ten in that the first digit to the left of the Base point is UNITS
In this case it is either ZERO or ONE
The next would be X BASE or the number in that position times two
The next position to the left would be X BASE SQUARED or in this case two squared or four
The next position to the left is X BASE to the third power or in this is EIGHT Note It is important that you do not ADD and get Six
Continuing to the left just increase each position to the NEXT POWER
Starting at the BASE point and going right works the same as BASE TEN in that the first position would be ONE over TWO Remember you can only have a ONE or a ZERO So it would be equal ZERO or equal
The next position to the right would be The next would be and so on
The number would be equal to the following Going from the BASE point to the left is Units or The next would be X BASE or times two equals two The next position in this case ZERO is only used as a placeholder The next position is X BASE squared or And the next position is X BASE to the third power or x x Remember its eight not six
So the binary is equal to add each position eight place holder plus plus or all together ELEVEN Each position to the right is figured the same as BASE TEN Position number is the next is and so on
The above number is equal to placeholder the next equal to or one fourth Therefore the above binary number in base ten
Note I should have mentioned earlier that the only way to understand what the BASE number we are working with equals is to convert it to BASE Because that is what we learned in school and have used most of our lives
Each BASE system follows the same rules that we started within BASE
Note The largest number that you may have in any Base System is always ONE LESS THAN THE BASE
In BASE it is NINE
In BINARY or BASE it is ONE
In BASE Octal it is SEVEN And in BASE Hexadecimal it is
Computers work on the BINARY system OCTAL and HEXADECIMAL systems are also used because they are easier than Binary to work with Example The hexadecimal fifteen is in the Binary system In Hexadecimal fifteen is F I will explain this later
The OCTAL number would equal XBase or X
And the would Added together So in OCTAL equals in BASE
In HEXADECIMAL the largest number is
If we use in the Hex system thru would be confusing because they need two places You may use any system such as circle square triangle and so on Or you could use any six symbols or colors
However most of the time we use A through F The following applies A B C D E and F HEXADECIMAL is calculated the same way as BASE BINARY AND OCTAL
Therefore Base would times Base squared or The XBase or or and units or Added together in BASE How to count in BASE BINARY OCTAL and HEXADECIMAL A B C D E F The nice thing about the computer system is that the s and s can be grouped into threes for OCTAL and groups of four for HEXADECIMAL
Therefore Binary for OCTAL would be or
Grouping into fours for HEXADECIMAL would be or E D E I hope by now that you can see how to convert between the BASES and how it is easier to read the numbers on the computer when they are grouped as described above

Realms Of The Haunting by Gremlin Graphics Solution by Phil Darke In Realms Of The Haunting you play the part of Adam Randall
Your father has died and you go to the village of Helston in Cornwall to investigate
Before starting the solution proper a few general points about the game
This game is enormous
At the time of writing I have been playing for about a month and am nearly half way through the game
The game is extremely atmospheric and keeps you coming back for more even though it is very hard in places
I have only one gripe and that is the control system
Movement is via the keyboard arrow keys and weapons are fired with the Control key
Object manipulation and cursor control is via the mouse
This is great if you are lucky enough to be ambidextrous but for lesser mortals like me it can be a bit of a pain
The centre of the cursor changes colour green indicates that the object can be picked up or used blue that it can be examined and red means it is a target
So if you are trying to pick up an object and trying to avoid monsters at the same time you need to use both mouse and keyboard together
Throughout the game you will pick up various maps
Unfortunately you can only access these via the inventory and then you can not see all of the map at once but have to scroll to the part you are interested in also there is nothing to show whereabouts on the map you are some sort of automap would have been much more useful
Despite this it is a terrific game and will hold your attention for a long time
Now a few words about combat
Shortly after the start of the game you pick up an automatic and several magazines for it
You will also find more magazines scattered throughout the game
Some times these are not easy to see and you need to search every location thoroughly making full use of the tilt up down and look up down keys
Shortly after the start of chapter you will acquire a shotgun which is much more effective
There are many monsters in the game and some are quite hard to kill
It is not necessary to kill every monster you meet and is often easier and less wasteful of ammunition and energy to avoid them
You can outrun most of the monsters you meet so unless they are preventing you from accomplishing something important run past or away from them
Also it is usually easier to kill monsters by shooting at them from a confined space such as a passage or open doorway
In a passage go as far forward as it is safe to go and fire a couple of rounds as they approach and then move back and fire a couple more
Remember also that the shotgun has a shorter range than the pistol although it does more damage
Also use the Z key to crouch as you then present a smaller target
When you enter some rooms the monsters do not appear until you have progressed some way into the room
If you are about to enter a new area it is a good idea to save before you enter
Open the door then turn around and walk in backwards
As soon as you hear the monsters you can then run back out and attack from the comparative safety of the open door
Enough waffle from me on with the game
CHAPTER ONE SHADOWS You start by the front door the doors here have symbols painted on them and you can not open them yet
Take the book and ammunition from the small table and walk down the passage
You enter a room with several doors
As you enter the typewriter starts to type
There is another magazine here
Take the page from the typewriter and the pistol and scrap book
Exit via the door to the left and go up the stairs to the first landing
Light the candles and turn right
Walk to the end of the passage and examine the painting
Light the two candles but stand to one side as you do so
A secret compartment behind the painting opens revealing a key
Take the key and turn around
Walk back down the passage and use the key to open a door on you right
Enter the study and you will see a video clip of your father's ghost
Switch on the lights and search the study
Pick up the following items Gold coiled serpent statues three masks sword three letters and colt ammunition from the desk a note from the floor and a shield
Click on the gramophone and listen to the strange noises
Click on the grandfather clock and note the time at which it chimes
Click on the bookcase to open it and walk in
Here you encounter the first monster
Dispose of it and continue down the steps to a room with a bridge over a river
As you enter another monster appears when you have killed it take a look around noting the square recess in the wall
Continue onward until you come to a room with a pool
A monster emerges from the pool
To your right you can see some more ammunition
As you approach another monster appears Continue on until you come to a room with a pentacle on the floor
Ahead of you are some wooden crates which contain ammunition for the colt and for the shotgun
Before you pick up the ammunition turn around so you are looking directly at the pentacle as soon as you pick up the ammunition a monster appears in the centre of the pentacle
Shoot it
Turn degrees to your left
In front of you is an alcove with a shelf
Take the orb and the ammunition from the floor
Turn right and walk forward to the door with the aperture in the middle Use the orb to open the door and enter
A monster appears shoot it and search the room
Take the map from the table and the sketch and healing potion from the small bureau
Leave and turn left go down the passage to your left
A monster appears in front of you and at the same time another appears behind you
Run forward shooting as you go
When you get across the bridge turn around and shoot the other
Continue on down the passage until you come to a circular room
This is where the technique of walking in backwards comes in useful
As you back into the room a monster appears in front of you and another four behind you
Shoot the one in front of you and run back up the passage
Turn around and shoot the other monsters as they come up the passage towards you
Once you have disposed of them all search the circular room to find a shotgun ammunition and two healing potions
Go back to the room with the pentagram and leave via the exit to the left of the wooden door
At the top of the steps you meet a further two monsters while a third awaits in the chamber at the end of the passage
Go down the passage and turn left
In the next room is a raised dais with a red pentagram and a sarcophogus
The concealed entrance behind this is your way back here later in the game
On the opposite wall is a door which can be opened by the lever
Go in and follow the passage
Facing you is a door with a passage around it
This passage is patrolled by two monsters
If you time it right you can enter the door without meeting either of them but you will probably meet them when you leave
Enter the door and search the crates for some ammunition for the pistol and the shotgun
Look through the bars and you will see another door
There is a lever here which opens this door but you have a limited time to reach it
It is easier to leave this room and walk around the passage and reach the lever from the other side of the bars
Another monster lurks inside this room
Search the boxes for more ammunition
There is a key on the wall as soon as you take this another monster appears
Spin around and dispose of it and then leave the way you came back to the room with the sarcophogus
In the corner of this room is another door opened by a lever
Enter and follow the passage at the end is a room wih several monsters save your game here
Run into the room
Don't even bother to try shooting the monsters here because they regenerate faster than you can kill them
There are four hand symbols on the wall two on the wall facing you one on the room with the transporter and the fourth which does not appear until you have pressed the other three is in a small side room
When you have pressed all four the monsters will die
Return to the transporter and read the words on the wall
Return to the room with the red pentacle and exit via the door behind the sarcopghogus
Open the portcullis in front of you and despatch the monster which appears
Go forward ignore the steps going down on your right for now and enter the door on your left which has writing on it
There is another monster in here and some ammunition for the shotgun
Exit and continue along the passage
Enter the door on your right and go through the small room into a room full of boxes
Get the shotgun and colt ammunition and leave the way you came
Continue along the passage and up the stairs to your right
Go through the shimmering doorway into the throne room
Sit on the throne and go back down the stairs
Exit via the steps which you ignored earlier into a room with two large statues
Don't touch them for the moment and don't try to open the door to the left of the farthest statue as it explodes
Go to the door on the right
Operate the lever and go through
After you have watched the movie clip carry on down the passage and turn left at the bottom of the steps
Go to the end and turn right
In front of you is a wooden bridge
Save your game
As you cross the wooden bridge two monsters appear in front of you and another behind you
These are very hard to kill but if you turn around quickly and run into the corner behind the pillars they can't get at you and you can shoot at them as they run around
Cross the bridge into the room and find two healing potions
Return to the bottom of the steps and walk ahead towards the water
Turn right and go up the steps
Take the shrive and the staff
The staff is some kind of weapon but I did not find it very effective
Return to the room with the two statues
Walk up to the one on your right and click on the statue
Turn around so that the statue is behind you and speak the words of power
Two monsters appear in front of you
Run past them to the steps at the far end of the room
Turn around and you can kill them as they approach
Return to the statue and go through the opening behind it
You now meet Florentine
It doesn't matter what you say to him as the outcome is always the same
When the clip is over you will be attacked by three skeleton monsters
When you have killed them open the wooden door and enter
Open the next doors with the shrive and enter the mausoleum
There is an altar her but do not approach it until you have thoroughly searched the rest to find some ammunition and a serpent statue
Approach the statue and meet Aelf
When the clip is finished take the three healing potions from the altar and get out as quick as you can as you will be attacked by more of the skeleton monsters
Return the way you came and follow the route back to the study
Use the shrive in the square recess that you saw earlier
This opens up a secret door leading to the study
When you arrive back in the study you will meet Rebecca who will be your companion for the rest of the game
CHAPTER THREE As you exit the study door a monster appears to your left kill it and go down the stairs
Turn left at the bottom as you walk along the passage a monster appears in front of you and another behind
Take the first door on the left and look at the green hemisphere
Leave and turn left
Enter the door at the end of the passage this is the dormitory
There is nothing much to do here except for a chest which you can move but I don't know what it does
Leave by the door opposite and turn left
Turn the sword mounted on the wall to open the door
Go up the stairs to the first landing and enter the door on your right
This is the armoury
After the end of the video clip you have about thirty seconds before several skeleton monsters appear
Grab the ammunition from the corner and the map from the top of the bookcase
Leave and turn right
Enter the door at the top of the stairs
You receive a message but there is nothing more you can do here for now
Go back down the stairs through the door and turn right at the end of the passage
Follow the passage and go through the door on your right
Open the first door on the left
Shoot the monster from the open doorway then enter
Look at the map and the empty picture frames
Pick up the helmet and use it
After you have watched the video clip exit via the double doors
Pick up the card near the front door
Turn right and go to the room where the typewriter is
Enter the first door on the right and pick up the map of the caverns from the table
Exit through the other door to a room with two maps and a fire
Take the crystal from the fire and leave the way you came
There are two monsters in the first room
Go back to the typewriter room and leave via the door opposite
Turn right and enter the first door on the left this is the locker room
In the corner near the door is a stone of a different colour to the rest of the floor
Click on it and a secret door opens
Inside is a map of the house
Go back to the room with the green sphere
Use the crystal and watch a video clip
You will meet Gnarl who asks you to take a test
Go to the opening with a view of the pyramids and take the masks from the wall
Click on the Green sphere CHAPTER FOUR Go back to the room at the top of the stairs by the armoury
Stand on the stone and use the masks
You will now be transported to the tower where you meet Raphael
When you have watched the video walk up the path to four pillars
Turn right and walk down the steps to the way stone
Touch the symbol to receive health points
Enter either of the shimmering doors and then walk to the plinth
Stand on it
You are transported to a court yard with a garden
Take a good look around and take the key from the circular pool
Open the locked door and enter
Take the map
As you do so you get a message and four monsters appear outside
Open the door and shoot them from the top of the steps
There is one other door here that you can open but there is only a monster inside who poses no threat if you leave him alone
Go and stand on the plinth again and return to where you entered the tower
CHAPTERFIVE You are transported back to the room up the stairs from the armoury
Step off the plinth and a hand appears on the wall
Click on the hand
You can now open the other door in this room
Go through the door along the passage and down the steps
Note the symbol on the floor and on the wall opposite
At the bottom of the steps is a door on your left
Enter and walk forward as you do so two monsters appear in front of you
Run back out of the door and shoot them from the open doorway
Go back into the room and stand on the sunken stone
Place one of the gold serpent statues on the plate on the floor
The stone rises allowing you to take the gold key
Don't forget to pick up the statue before you leave
Leave the room and walk straight ahead and then turn left into a room full of boxes
As you walk into the room several axe wielding demons appear
Run back the way you came and stand on the steps
When the demons stand on the symbol on the floor shoot at the symbol on the wall
A stone rises from the floor an squashes them
When you have disposed of all the demons return to the room with the boxes
Open the first door and move the lever this moves the boxes allowing you to open the other door
Go through and follow the passage and enter the door opposite
Pick up the ammunition and health potion
As you leave the room a monster appears before you
Go down the steps and follow the passage until you enter a large cave
Walk to the far right corner of the room
Watch the video and exit via the passage near here
Carry on down until you reach some steps leading down
Save your game here
The next part of the game is extremely hard and took me a long time to complete
In your inventory you should have a map of the caves
Unfortunately I did not find this much help and was unable to follow it
This is a large area and it is easy to get lost in it
The only essential task here is to collect a red crystal and to give it to the Red Demon here
There are large numbers of green flying creatures here who will attack you
If you try to kill them you find that for every one you kill several more appear
The best strategy is to keep moving and dodge them as far as possible
At the bottom of the steps as you leave turn about degrees left and run along the walkway across a wooden bridge
Turn degrees left across another bridge then forward and sharp right
Run between the two torches and keep going until you come to a turning on your right
Ignore this for now but remember where it is
Continue until you reach a T junction with a drop in front of you
Turn right and then left between the torches
The cave containing the red crystal is now before you
Grab it and get out as quick as you can
Return the way you came and go left down the passage you ignored before
About half way along this passage is a turning to the right
If you go in here you will find a teleporter which takes you to a small chapel
Here there is a health potion on the altar and several boxes of shotgun ammunition
There are also quite a lot of flying monsters
The amount of hassle to get in here and get these items I thought was quite frankly not worth the effort
So unless you are desperately short of ammunition
I suggest you don't bother
So ignore this turning and continue along the passage across a wooden bridge sharp left and cross another bridge
Turn right and follow the walkway around to the left
There is an alcove in the wall here containing some shotgun ammunition
Grab this and carry on
Turn right at the end of the walkway and then right until the walkway forks
Take the left fork and enter the cave on the right
Here you encounter the demon
Tell him your name and then give him the red stone
As soon as you can go ahead and through the stone door
CHAPTER SIX Go up the flight of steps in front of you but stop on the third step from the top
Turn left and crouch
The monster at the top cannot hit you from you here but if you stand up as he approaches take a quick couple of shots and crouch down again you can eventually kill him
Though it takes quite a long time and a lot of ammunition
Once you have disposed of him you can enter the chamber
Cross the moving stones to the far door
Enter and walk straight ahead
A bear like creature appears before you run back down the passage turn and shoot as he approaches
Return to the room
In front of you is a breastplate before you touch it explore the rest of this room to find some ammunition
Pick upthe breast plate
You now meet Aelf again
As soon as this video is finished you can find two health potions in the place where the breastplate was
Another bear creature and two monsters appear
Either kill them or run up the stairs and through the wooden door
Look at the writing on the wall read it if you want to but I don't think it helps solve the game
The area you are in now consists of several rooms connected by a corridor
Make sure that you search all the rooms thoroughly
There is a skeleton monster patrolling the corridor but with careful timing you don't need to bother with it as it is quite easy to avoid
Exit via the door to the left of the one you entered by switch on the light and go into the room opposite
This is Florentine's living room
Switch on the light and take the health potion from the top of the bookcase the map of the Raquia maze sketch of a sword and a magnifying glass
Exit via the other door to the bedroom
Switch the light on and pick up the staff from under the bed
note Florentine's staff can be used as a weapon but DON'T attempt to use it
It has a very special purpose later in the game and if you have used up all the shots from it you will not be able to complete the game Pick up the healing potions from the chest and note the locked cupboard
The door opposite the one you entered by contains a stone with dead rats
There is nothing to do here so exit by the third door
Open the door opposite there is a bear type monster here and some crates containing more health potions
Go back out to the corridor there are some wooden boxes here containing some ammunition for the colt
Go up the steps to the room with the flashing light
There are some bear type monstershere but they are slow and easy to avoid
Open the door opposite
Turn left and run to the end of the passage
A skeleton monster will pursue you turn and shoot him
Go back and past the door you entered by
On your left is a short flight of steps leading up to the observatory
There is also a light switch here
Explore the observatory and pick up the quill pen and ink and the journal
Examine the journal to find a small key
Go back to the bedroom and use the key to open the locked cupboard
Take the Serpent statue and go back to the room where you found the breast plate
Open the wooden door and use Florentine's staff on the green symbol on the wall
a teleport pad rises
Step onto it to be transported back to the Study CHAPTER SEVEN You now have all the Serpent statues
Place them on the pads surrounding the Sarcophagus
The Sarcophagus opens
Enter and follow the passage until you come to two pools either side of the passage
These rooms are guarded by a two headed green monster
Kill them and enter pick up the silver chalices and fill them from the fountains by clicking on them
Exit and continue along the passage to a hallway
There is a mosaic on the floor
Stand on it to see a video clip
To your right and left are two doors which can be opened by throwing the water from the chalices at them
If you enter the one on the right you will find a sword but will be killed when you leave
Ahead is a lock
Enter the room on the left
Pick up Aelf's dagger and watch a video clip
When you leave you will be confronted by Belial
Choose whichever response you like the outcome is always the same
Now run and get out as fast as you can back to the study
CHAPTER EIGHT Leave the study and head towards the front door
As you approach a zombie appears in front of you
Use the dagger to dispose of him
Now open the door and enter follow the passage to another door
In this room is a Pentacle on the floor surrounded by candles
Light the candles and watch the video clip
A large winged monster appears
He is very hard to kill but fortunately quite slow moving
So run back out through one of the doors and shoot at him through the open doorway
If you are low on ammunition you can use Aelf's dagger which re charges itself
When the monster is destroyed he leaves behind a statuette
Exit via the door to the left of the one you entered by
Turn left and go up the stairs here you will find a cupboard with some shotgun ammunition and a healing potion
Go back down the stairs and turn left go straight ahead through two doors
Turn left and go down the steps
There is a cupboard here containing shotgun ammunition and a die
Go back up the stairs and through the door on your left and the door opposite
Open the door on your left and enter a room with ahuge table
There are three health potions on the table
jump on the table as you take the third potion two monsters appear
Run back out of the door and shoot them from the open doorway
Go back in and pick up the ammunition from the corner by the window
Leave via the other door and turn right
Go through the door on your left and the one opposite
Turn right and go through the opening on your right
Go up the steps through two doors and into the court yard
Pick up the healing potion to the right of the gate and then go and open the door to the left
Shoot the monster from the open doorway then enter and pick up the gun
As you pick it up two zombies attack you
Run out of the door
In the courtyard several more zombies are waiting
Go down the steps to the corner to the left of the door
Get right into the corner behind the bushes from here the zombies are unable to get at you but you can still shoot at them
When you have destroyed them enter the door to the left of the one you just left
Go through the door opposite and through the next door into a passage
Switch on the lights and go to the other end of the passage
There is a slot beside the door this requires the statuette
Open the door and enter
CHAPTER NINE This is Florentine's library
As soon as you are able turn around and leave
Two monsters appear before you
Run past them and out of the door at the other end
Now turn around and shoot at the monsters from the open doorway
Return to the library
Open the door and shoot at the monster inside from the open doorway
Enter and switch on the light
Pick up three parchments the complete map of the tower a quill pen and ink and a health potion
Leave the library not forgetting to collect the statuette on the way
Go to the other end of the passage and exit via the door on the right into a small court yard
Listen to the voices and approach the stone
Leave the court yard and go through the door on the right
Turn right and go down the steps
Ahead is another door which requires the statuette to open it
Enter and take the door on the left into the cellar
There is a maze here
Search the maze until you reach a room with a pool and pillars
Go through and open the door ahead of you
Go up the steps and watch a video clip
CHAPTER TEN Take a crystal from the stone then go up the steps to the altar
At the back is a lever which opens a door
Go through the door and step onto the stone
Use the mask and you will teleport to the tower
Within a few seconds of arrival at the tower you will be attacked by a flying monster
It is not hard to kill but you do need to aim very accurately and quickly
Now look at the complete map of the tower
You are currently at the top middle of the map where there are three stones
Use the map to make your way to the stone with the Raquia symbol on it at the top left of the map
As you leave the last of the shimmering portals you will be attacked by another of the flying monsters
Movement here is difficult because the path is very steep and quite narrow
What I did was to run back up the path and back into the portal and shoot at it through the doorway
Continue until you reach Raquia
Follow the stone path until it runs out
To your right are some grass steps
Cross them until you rejoin the path
Turn left and walk up to the next corner
To your right you can see some pillars
This area is guarded by a winged green monster
The easiest way to deal with it is to use hit and run tactics quickly go around the corner and take a quick shot then run back it takes a little time but it is safe
After you have dealt with him follow the path on around past the next corner
Then turn left through the gap in the hedges
Rejoin the path and follow it until you see some steps leading to the tower
Head toward the tower
As you approach the archway you will see a video clip
You have to collect the following items from the maze before going to the tower a ring ear plugs jewelled meat and pan pipes You have a map of the Raquia maze in your inventory
The arch way through which you enter is at the bottom of the map in the middle
First go and get the ear plugs which are bottom left of the map
The jewelled meat is here on top of a pillar
There is aswitch at the base of the bench which lowers the pillar
From here head to the right of the map to find the pan pipes
Jump across the pillars which are rising up and down to get the pipes
Next head for the top left of the maze to get the ring
More jumping onto the floating pads
Now head for the tower
Give the jewelled meat to the monster as quick as you can
Go through the right hand portcullis turn left then right and go down the passage until you come to some steps on your right
Go up and follow the passage past some windows on your right until you reach the bell chamber
The object here is to reach the opposite door without making the bell ring
Go down the steps to your left and cross to the steps
Jump onto the steps and go up walk to the end then jump onto the stone in front of you
Turn right and jump onto the moving stone and from there onto the moving steps
Walk to the end and turn left
Jump onto the moving stone and turn left
Now jump onto the steps which run up the side of the wall
Walk to the end and turn left jump onto the moving stone and from there to the exit
This room has seven doors and a pillar in the middle
Number the doors to from left to right
Room use the pan pipes and enter
Take the flask of oil and spectacles
Room use the ear plugs and enter
Click on the siren to get a key
Room
Use the oil and wear the spectacles
Jump over the first beam then walk around the other two
Take the scroll and examine it
Door
Click on the door and say the word SPIRIT
Take the warm flask
Room
Use the warm flask on the floor then go and get the armlet
Room open the door with the silver key
Take six crystals from the window
Place these on the points of the pentacle in the correct order
Take the rainbow key
Room
Wear the armlet and enter go through the door opposite and open the cupboard
Take the coloured gem and the health potion
Go to the pillar and place the coloured gem in the recess
Step onto the pillar and walk forward to the door ahead
The room is full of spheres which explode when touched
Use the crouch and tilt keys to manoeuvre your way to the left hand corner
Pick up the gem and combine it with the ring
Walk through the double doors
Step onto the plinth and use the ring
Take the key of tears
You now have to make your way back the way you came to the study The path back through the maze is slightly different to the way you came
Watch out for the hedge cutting machines
When you get out of the maze you will find several zombies and a green winged monster waiting for you
I found that the easiest way was to make a run for it
Go back through the tower and step onto the stone
When you arrive back at the temple
There is a zombie and another monster
You will need to destroy both of them if you are to make it through the cellar maze
You can shoot at the zombie from behind the altar using the crouch key to duck down and avoid his fireballs it is not easy but it can be done
The other monster is a bit harder you can try shooting at him from the top of the altar steps but I did not find this very successful and eventually ran past him into the pool room
You still need to kill him however
When you run down into the pool room he will follow you but won't follow you up the steps on the other side
So you can shoot him from the top of the steps
In the cellar maze there are three of the whirling dervish skeleton type monsters
These are very hard and if they get too close will kill you in seconds
Walk through the cellar maze until you see one of these monsters ahead of you
Turn and run back through the pool room and through the doors into the altar room
The monster will follow but won't come through the door
You can now shoot him from the steps through the open door
Repeat this procedure until you have destroyed all three
There may actually be a fourth as I heard one when I was going out of the maze but did not actually encounter it
From here make your way carefully back to the study You will meet a couple of the ordinary monsters on the way but these are comparatively easy to deal with
By running through the nearest door and shooting them through the open doorway
CHAPTER ELEVEN Enter the sarcophagus and go to the clock chamber
There are three of the green winged monsters and several zombies here
You can kill them by shooting at them from the top of the steps down into the chamber
They are quite hard to kill and it will take some time
You may find it easier to take a chance and run through the chamber
Return to the room where you met Belial
Approach the lock and use the key of tears
Watch a video clip and talk to Hawk who will give you loads of information
CHAPTER TWELVE Cross the bridge and stand on the mantel stone to be transported to St Michael's church
There are several zombies here but don't try to shoot them as there are too many
As soon as you arrive run to the rectory and enter the front door
Switch on the light and open the cupboard to the right of the front door and take the torch
This enables you to see the green ward symbols make sure you keep it in your hand all the time you are in the rectory
Now click on the welcome mat and pick up the ward disruption wand
Use this to destroy the wards on doors in here
Go through the door to the left of the front door
Destroy the two green wards in here and go through into the kitchen
Open the fridge and take the key
Destroy the ward on the door to the left of the fridge and go through
Destroy the wards on the doors to the left and right
Go through the right hand door into the TV room
You can switch the TV on with the remote control on the desk but there is nothing else to do in here
Go back out and through the left hand door this leads to the cellar
Open the next door and enter
Switch on the light and go down the steps into the cellar
There are three monsters in here
When they appear run back up the steps and shoot at them through the open doorway at the top
This will get rid of one of them but the other two are a little more difficult
Half way down the cellar steps to the left and right are two more flights of steps leading down
You can shoot at them from the landing at the top of these steps but be careful that while concentrating on one the other can attack from behind you
Once you have disposed of all three explore the rest of the cellar
There is a green two headed monster in a cage but he is no threat
Light the candle you find and look for a green ward
Destroy it and go down the passage to the laboratory Switch on the lights and take the health potion form the bench and the key from the corner
Return to the cellar and use the key you got from the lab to open a pair of ornate doors
There is a tree here through a shimmering portal but there is nothing to do here apart from look at it
Go back up the cellar and into the hallway
Go up the stairs
Ignore the first room on your left for now
Open the second door on the left and enter destroy the green ward on the left and go into the bathroom
Switch on the light and destroy the ward on the door opposite
Open the door but don't go more than a couple of steps into the room
Turn around to face the door and switch on the light
Open the door and side step to the right
As soon as you hear the monsters behind you side step back left and run through the door
You can now turn around and shoot the monstersthrough the doorway
Get the key from the bedside locker and go back out
Now return to the door which you ignored before
Enter and open the wardrobe
Destroy the green ward and go through the wardrobe
There are two cupboards here one with a green ward gives you a view into another room
The other contains a key
There is one more room to explore up here another bathroom but I did not find anything in here
Go back down to the hallway and open the door to the right of the front door
Open the door and enter and switch on the light
Run forward and turn right and exit via the other door
The monsters will have appeared behind you and you can now shoot them from the doorway
Examine the bookcase to find three books
Examine the brown book in your inventor to get the key for the church tower
Time now to leave the rectory and head for the church
But first there are still some zombies outside to deal with
Stand in front of the front door and position yourself so that if you run backwards you will go up the stairs
Open the front door and walk forwards
When the first of the zombies appears run backwards up the stairs
The zombie should follow you into the house but will not follow you up the stairs
The front door will close behind him and you can shoot at him from the landing
Repeat this until you have destroyed as many as possible
There are still more outside but with luck you can avoid them
Go out of the front door and turn left along the side of the building
Jump over the fence and run towards the church porch
Turn around and go in backwards
As soon as you hear the monster behind you
Run back to the rectory and into the front door
The monster will follow but will not enter the door
From here you can shoot him
When he is killed he leaves behind a coin
Pick it up
Now return to the porch and put the coin in the collection box
Open the door and enter
Turn left and go into the tower
Go up the first flight of steps and pick up a tiara from the table
Carry on up and get a key
Return to the church and go to the pulpit
Pick up and read the note book
Now go to the stained glass window behind the altar
As you approach you will see a video clip and receive two feathers
Now go to the door in the screen Save your game here as the game sometimes does not do what it should
Enter and look at the picture
Put the tiara on the head of the statuette and a feather in the indentation in the table
What should now happen is that the picture should open but the first time I tried it two monsters appeared
If this happens just reload your saved game and try again
Walk into the opening in the picture and Aelf appears
After the video clip take the two health potions and go back to the church
CHAPTER THIRTEEN Leave the church and run to the mantel stone and wear the mask to be transported to the tower
Look at the complete map of the tower
Head for Arqua which is at the bottom left of the map
Take care when you enter the second portal as a flying monster attacks as you approach the exit
I found the easiest way to deal with it was to run back through the portal as soon as it appeared and then turn around when I got to the other side and shoot it as it emerged from the portal
Carry on down the path until you come to a mantel stone
Check your health before stepping onto it and use a health potion if you need it since you will lose all your inventory when you enter Raquia
When you arrive you will find a parchment in your inventory
Read it
Head down either path and enter the first gate you come to
Go into the house and look around until you find a teleport pad with red in it
Step onto it and you will be transported to the next floor
Walk to the fountain in the middle
There are two gold coloured pads on the floor one has an eye symbol and the other a chalice
Click on the eye symbol to be transported to another part of the building
Just follow the steps to the highest point where you will find a magnifying glass
Now return to the teleporter you arrived on and return to the fountain
Click on the chalice
When you arrive go down the first flight of steps turn left then down another flight on your left turn right at the bottom and then go up a flight on your right
Turn left down the next flight of steps through a gap in the wall and turn left at the bottom
Turn left and follow the passage keeping the wall on your left until you come to a flight of steps leading up
Turn left at the top then up another flight and turn right
Carry on up the steps and from here you should be able to see the chalice over to your left
Pick it up and return the way you came back to the room with the fountain
In each corner of the fountain room is a shimmering door which you can not walk through
Fill the chalice from the fountain and throw it at the doors
You will now be able to enter
Go into each room in turn
In one you will find a metal flask containing red powder and another containing black powder
In another corner is a plate which you can not yet open but if you examine it with the magnifying glass you will see the word GRIND
The next room to the left of this one contains a fan and another plate which you can open with a scroll inside
Continue to the next room on the left to find a piece of flint and a steel cylinder
A plate here has the word BURN on it
The fourth room contains a mortar and pestle and a plate with the word BONG on it
From your inventory combine the mortar and pestle then the black and red powder to make snow
Combine the cylinder and flint
Use the cylinder and flint with the snow
The bong panel opens to reveal some amber
Now go to the room with the grind panel and click on it to get a hookah
Go to the room with the burn panel
Use the magnifying glass with the scroll
Use the scroll with the cylinder and flint
The burn panel can now be opened to reveal some tinder
Now use the tinder with the cylinder and flint to make fire
Use the amber with the mortar and pestle to make incense
Now go to the fountain and look at the symbols on the wall around it
Place the fan on the cloud symbol
Place the incense on the gold square
Place the snow on the wavy line symbol
Place the burning tinder on the flame symbol
Rebecca will now tell you that it is time to put the offering together
Use the snow with the hookah then use the incense with it next the fire and finally the fan
Now click on the fountain to be given the Dragon Sword
This is supposed to be a powerful weapon but I found that it was not very good at all and I found Aelf's dagger to be the most useful followed by the blunderbuss
CHAPTER FOURTEEN Now go to one of the white telepads to go back to the ground floor and from there back to the mantel stone to the tower
Once back in the tower Look at the complete map of the tower you need to head for the mantel stone which is near the top of the map and to the right of the one which brought you here from St Michaels
There are several monsters guarding the approach to this and they are very hard to kill
Unless you are particularly good at fighting don't take them on in one to one combat
Head back towards the stone when you exit from the first portal you come to a T junction turn right there and go through the next portal As you approach the exit to this portal you can see a monster ahead of you at the top of the steps
Shoot at him from inside the exit to the portal and follow the path until you reach a place where the path crosses above one at right angles to it
From this point you can see two of the monsters patrolling the path below
Use either Aelf's dagger or the blunderbuss to shoot at them as they walk underneath
When you have destroyed these two continue a short way along the path and turn right
Over to your left is a way stone with a monster on it and you can easily kill him from here
The monsters who explode in a shower of sparks leave a health potion so it is well worth a trip around the paths to collect them before heading towards the mantel stone
Step onto the mantel stone
You are taken prisoner by Belial and end up in a cell
Take all the notices from the notice board and read them
After a short while you are rescued by Rebecca
CHAPTER FIFTEEN Exit via the door Rebecca opened and go to the next cell where you will find some ammunition health potions and a map for the grave yard and the third part of Florentine's journal
Leave and head up the stairs
Open the door and walk carefully into the chamber
There are zombies in here
Quickly open the door and run back down the stairs
You can now go back up and shoot them from the open doorway
There are more zombies outside so open the double doors and then quickly open the other door the zombies will come into the chamber and the doors will close behind them
Now deal with them as you did before
Open the doors and proceed straight ahead through the grave yard
When you are about half way across you will encounter more zombies
Run back to the chamber
The zombies will follow and you can deal with them as before
Go back out and cross the grave yard and through the gates
Turn right and walk up to the three flames
Click Florentines journal on the flames and they will be extinguished
CHAPTER SIXTEEN The door to you right now opens
Go through and down the tunnel
There are more zombies and monsters around the tunnel exit
Shoot them if you can but if not run straight ahead to the grave yard maze
Enter and make your way cautiously toward the mantel stone in the centre
There are more zombies and monsters patrolling the maze
The stone itself is guarded by three zombies and you really need to destroy them before you use it if you can
If not try making a run for it
Stand on the stone and use the mask
As soon as you arrive in the tower you will be attacked by a flying monster who is quite hard to kill
If you approached the mantel stone from the left hand side as you are facing it from the entrance then you will be facing the right direction when you arrive
This will give you a couple more seconds in which to deal with the flying monster
You have arrived at the mantel stone at the bottom right of the tower map and you need to head for the stone with the Sheol symbol on it
There are more monsters to kill on the way don't forget to pick up the health potions which they leave
When you arrive you will find that the stone does not work
This is because you don't have the Dragon sword and the Shrive
To your right you can see another way stone but there is a gap in the path leading to it
Run and jump across the gap
Enter the portal and pick up the sword and the shrive
There is a health potion on the other way stone here if you killed the monster
Now return to the stone and step onto it
Walk down the path and talk to Abbadon
Walk through the arch
The floor rises leaving you in a chamber
The chamber has a stepped circular pillar in the middle
On the perimeter of the chamber is the brain machine
You have to feed this machine with brains in order to get the circular stone to lower so that you can go to the arch
You will find brains around the perimeter of the chamber and one behind the machine
The rest are in the maze of tunnels and caves
Radiating out from the perimeter of the chamber are four double tunnels
These lead to four more tunnels in a roughly rectangular shape around the chamber
There are four caves at top bottom and each side of the rectangular tunnels
Three of the caves contain two brains and the fourth one
The remaining four brains are in the dead ends of two tunnels which run north to south at either side of the chamber between the rectangle and the central chamber
There are monsters in the caves and patrolling the tunnels
They are fast and very vicious the good news however is that it only needs one hit from Aelf's dagger to kill them
The description I have given of the maze is very basic and it is easy to get lost
What I did was to run around the maze and save every time I found a brain or killed a monster
It takes some time but you can do it with a little patience
When you finally have all brains return to the machine and use them on the machine
As soon as the last brain is in the machine quickly run behind the machine
A monster appears he can not follow you in here but you can shoot at him
Walk back to the centre and through the arch
You now discover the truth about Rebecca
Walk through the arch into a room with a throne and a red light with a figure inside it
Talk to the figure
There are three tunnels leading from this room
Inside are mirrors
As you approach each mirror when your reflection becomes visible a monster runs toward you
You cannot kill them
What you have to do is to fire at the mirror before you are attacked
The easiest way to do this is to approach each one at an angle so that you can see the mirror but your reflection does not appear
Then shoot at it
When all mirrors have been smashed
Walk up to the throne
It sinks revealing an arch
Walk through the arch and talk to Hawk
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN Walk back through the arch to a room with eight rooms leading off it
There is a puzzle to be solved in each room before you can proceed
I have numbered the rooms to anti clockwise being straight ahead as you arrive

Walk forward and click on the symbol on the wall
Now enter the door on your left
Ahead of you is a tiled floor
You have to cross the tiles in the correct order
The tiles form a x grid
Number the columns to from left to right and the rows A to F from top to bottom
Now step on the tiles in the following order F E D C C C B A A A A
Now walk forward and touch the hand symbol
The tiled floor turns to green slime and a force field bars your exit
Run across the slime and shoot the force field as you run

This is a mirror maze
Just find the hand symbol click on it and find your way out again

This room contains a gun and twelve spheres
The object is to get the bullet to ricochet off each sphere in turn and finally exit via the square at the top left
If you want to work this out for yourself the way I did it was to draw a chart showing the position of each sphere and then number them
Then by trial and error find out which switch controls which sphere
Then work out which position causes the bullet to ricochet onto another sphere
There is only one correct position for each switch
It should not take too long but if you can't be bothered to go through all that here are the correct positions for each switch numbered clockwise from assuming to be the twelve o'clock position
Top row
Second row
Third row

This room contains a green translucent maze and five hand symbols
The object is to open walls within the maze to get to the button
To do this click on the top right and bottom left hand buttons

Shoot at the wall to remove the force field and reveal a row of coloured stones Use the controls on the gun to move it and then shoot all the stones

This puzzle consists of twelve blocks which move up and down controlled by seven levers
Move the levers until all the blocks are at the top leaving a clear space at the bottom
Then fire the gun
Now move the blocks to create a clear space at the top then fire the gun again

There are four mirrors in this room
Three of the four are protected by force fields
Breaking the unprotected mirror removes the force field from one of the others
There are also fireball traps
Avoid these by jumping over the pools of light on the floor
It is easier to jump diagonally
Destroy all four mirrors then go to the room opposite the entrance and jump on the pillar

There are a number of blocks which can be moved by means of the switches
Create a path to the room on the other side
Press the hand symbol and return
Warning do NOT save your game during this puzzle
If you do then when you restore all the blocks will be returned to their start position
Once you have solved all eight puzzles go to the entrance to each room and click on the symbol to move the red dot to the six o'clock position
There is a specific order in which to do them but I could not figure out what it is
So just keep going around until they are all done
You will hear a giggle and the flames will be extinguished
A guy with a flame thrower appears and comes after you
He is very tough and you have no chance against him in one to one combat
Let him catch sight of you then run into one of the rooms and down the corridor leading to the puzzle
From the entrance to this corridor you can shoot at him
Aelfs dagger and the blunderbuss appeared to have no effect on him so I used the shotgun
When you have finally killed him
Click on his body to get the Shield of Perdition
This is supposed to protect you from flames
Now go through the arch
Save your game and go back through it again
You arrive near a castle
As soon as you arrive you will be attacked by a flying creature
It is very hard to kill and takes at least three direct hits from Aelf's dagger to kill
When you have killed this creature turn approximately ninety degrees to your left
In the distance you can see another flying creature coming in to attack fortunately this one takes a few seconds before attacking
Giving you just enough time to use a health potion if you need it and take aim
Pick up the health potion from near the arch
Cross the bridge and head for the castle
Follow the wall around to your left and pick up up two more health potions
Now head for the centre
Here you find Rebecca
Make your decision
Belial appears
Run and crouch behind one of the smaller stones
From here you can stand up and shoot at him and duck when you see one of his fireballs coming
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Click on the green hemisphere
When you arrive run to the tunnel picking up the health potion
Turn around and you will see another health potion on the window ledge
Carefully run over and grab it
Making sure you are not spotted by the red flying creature
Go down the tunnel and stop before you enter the cave
There are several flying monsters out there six I think and three green winged monsters as well
These will fly in through the cave mouth and attack you
Youreally need to destroy these to progress further but if you feel confident try making a run for it
These creatures require about three direct hits to kill
So you need to be very accurate
When you have destroyed all go forward and cross the river by the wooden bridge
Follow the walkway until you come to some stone steps leading up
Two flying monsters will attack from the top of the steps
You do have a couple of seconds breathing space though so choose the shotgun and aim for the top of the steps as you don't have time to wait for Aelf's dagger to re charge
Start shooting as soon as the first one appears and when you have killed one quickly run back around the corner and turn and deal with the second one as it approaches
Continue up the steps and round to the right
Cross the wooden bridge and kill the monster blocking your way
Enter the cave and pick up the health potion
Continue until you see two monsters blocking the tunnel ahead
Kill them and run through the tunnel
There are three flying monsters in the tunnel
Kill them if you can but if not just run for it
Step onto the stone
CHAPTER NINETEEN You arrive to find Florentine Gaul and Hawk gathered
Choose your responses and wait for the outcome
CHAPTER TWENTY You return to the court yard close to where you get the blunderbuss
The house is starting to collapse and you need to get out
There are zombies here but don't waste any time on them
Run forward and up the stone steps and through the double doors
Turn left and through the door in front of you
Take the next door on the left and continue through the door ahead
Turn right and down the passage slightly to your right
Go through the right hand door at the end of this passage
Take the next left then through the door to your right
Turn right then follow the passage through two left turns to a door on your right
Put Florentines staff in your weapon hand and open the door
Proceed slowly into the room
When the blue monster appears
Use Florentine's staff three times to kill it
You can now open the front door and get out

GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
ldquo R E M E D Y rdquo Demo amp Game Walkthrough Len Green th November lengreen hotmail com PREFACE Shortly before finishing this walkthrough I received the following email from the pair of Developers hellip Mikael and Eleen Nyqvist http www mdna games com
I myself stumbled upon only about a half of these ldquo mini Easter Eggs rdquo whilst beta testing and repeatedly playing ldquo Remedy rdquo
Hi Len This may be totally meaningless especially for the walkthrough but just for the heck of it we compiled a small and no doubt incomplete list of things that easily can be missed in the game but aren't necessary
quot Easter eggs quot might be a too strong word Here goes Take care M amp E If you would like to read amp or perform any of them please link to the very end of this walkthrough
FOREWORD A This walkthrough describes theabsolute MINIMUM actions onlywhich youmusttake in order to succeed
There are a few actions which players aremost likelyto perform whichSEEMto be essential but actually are not Some of these have been mentioned and designated as such in the walkthrough in order to save the player unnecessary frustrations
However please don rsquo t use this walkthroughunless youabsolutely have to Many aspectswhich are notessentialhave been omitted A lot of these are interesting and provide much of the background story to the game and particularly to the fascinating and artistic character and scenery of Norrk ping hellip a relatively small town in Sweden
B ldquo Warning rdquo The main purpose of this game is to examine items interview people and generally lsquo act the tourist rsquo etc Some of these actions are essential but many are not and quite a few are red herrings
If you simply take this walkthrough in your hand and follow exactly what to do amp not to do you can probably finish the game very quickly Thishowever would completely defeat its whole purpose
C This walkthrough does not do justice to ldquo Remedy rdquo A very great part of the interest and beauty of the game is wandering around through the vast number of locations and views hellip There are so many that I rsquo m pretty certain that I missed a few L I have includedONLYtheessentiallocations and actions together with a few puzzle solutions To have evenattemptedto describe the many panoramas and the local characters would have taken me more than twice the time and double the length
D This is a first person game and much of the intricacy lies in browsing around hellip and as aforementioned there is alotof that I personally frequently lsquo got lost rsquo looking for some location or object and sometimes after finding it lost my wayagainon returning
Despite this fact however I have not given exact lsquo direction instructions rsquo in this walkthrough hellip i e
you won rsquo t find extensive ldquo forward forward right back left left forward right etc rdquo descriptions The player will be told where to go but not exactly how to get there Nevertheless quite a few times where finding a vital location is particularly tricky but essential some accurate direction instructionsAREincluded
E On entering every new location it is advisable to browse around as much as possible in order to explore the general layout However the walkthrough never tells you explicitly to do this F You shouldNOT haveto follow the identical order of accessing locations as described in this walkthrough Some locations of course will not appear on the map until you have completed certain tasks and so aparticularorder issometimesessential Other than this you are free to visit amp or revisit as you wish
G There is no need to describe ANY of the lsquo mechanics rsquo amp or interface of the game It is all contained in the short lsquo ReadMe txt rsquo file in the ldquo Remedy rdquo folder on your Hard Disc after installing of course
H There are absolutely no action sequences and you never get killed in this game There are no slider puzzles or mazes
Nevertheless it is easy to make a wrong or redundant move So it is advisable tosave frequently There are an infinite number of save slots
Each save is very small only KB and so saving and loading is almost instantaneous presenting no delays to progress
I A very personalsuggestionONLY
When people including myself need to look at a walkthrough they can rsquo t avoid seeing additional hints hellip especially speed readers in their mother tongue This can be very upsetting Since this walkthrough is FULL of spoilers I recommend the following alsoin generalfor ALL walkthroughs Decide upon one or more most appropriate keyword Access ldquo Edit Find rdquo on your walkthrough rsquo s toolbar enter your keyword and search With luck this should take you immediately or almost immediately just to the area where you need help hellip minimizing the risk of seeing additional spoilers
Simply as a very theoretical example Suppose you rsquo re stuck in a location with a fretsaw that you think you need to do something with but don rsquo t know what or how or maybe even where Try searching for the word lsquo fretsaw rsquo in the walkthrough or just lsquo saw rsquo or maybe lsquo blade rsquo or lsquo workshop rsquo or lsquo wood rsquo etc

Note Although you can use the online help on the corner of the screen it's still annoying to wait a few minutes just to get through a section if you're stuck In the beginning In the cinematic sequence just use the dragon blaster and go inside the cave
After the cinematic intro sequence Rodrigo will go back to his office
First go out from office and there's an elevator going up which lead to Louis' house and going down lead to the sewer
Go to Louis' house and talk to him
He will talk about the pirates
Not much to do here
Ride Rodrigo's glider and go to Sancho's Inn
Sancho's Inn When you arrive you'll meet two men bullying a woman but they soon run away after knowing who you are
Go inside Sancho's inn and go upstairs
You'll meet a man sitting alone drinking beer
Sit down and talk to him a few times until he becomes irritated

Click on desk to get gold sack Go outside and the gold sack will drop into the sewer
It's part of the story so don't worry about it When you try to enter the sewer entrance the guard won't let you in Go to Sancho and borrow his horn
Use horn outside the office but not in front of the guard
The Sewer This place is simple and straight forward if you have explored thoroughly and know all the right passages to go to
I can't explain to you one by one 'cause it will confuse you
Don't worry about the blocked passage as they are for decoration only
Just go through until you see a closed passage and a crank beside it
The gold sack is lying on the water but it goes away when you try to take it
Use the crank to open the gate but the rope will snap
Yeah this seems quite a hard puzzle but simple if you know where to go
Go outside the sewer as nothing you can do here
The Forest Use glider to go out from Smashville and go to forest in the center of map
You may go to Endavin but there's nothing you can do in there as you don't have the accessories to enter the heavily guarded city yet
When you reach the forest there's a different paths leading east west north south northeast southwest
First go up to meet a girl skipping
AHA
That's what you need to fix the broken crank
Talk to her and ask for the rope
She won't give you even if you try to snatch it from her you better not you know when you'll see
Go down two times and you'll notice a bush on the right
Look at bush and get a teddy bear
Give teddy bear to the girl and she'll give you her rope
You'll know what to do next don't you
I hope you do Upon replacing the rope on the crank use it and the gate will be raised

Go to the dead end which has poisonous bush and use mushroom on bush
After the explosion take the poisoned leaves and return to dragon burial ground
Go inside the skull through ear hole and use leaves on brain
Go outside from the teeth and watch those pesky scavengers explode in glory Go outside
A pirate will jump out and atttack you but the dragon will toast him to ashes as his gratitude
Take the hat and cyber hand
Then go back to Smashville and go to Ranama's observatory
Talk to him in close range and you'll notice an earring Click on earring times and snatch the earring when Ranama isn't looking
Go to Endavin
Endavin Before you enter observe a pirate whom you meet at Sancho's inn when he enters the city
The guard will ask you the same thing

Examine the pile of rubble on the right to get a safety pin Dunno what its purpose though
Enter the inn
Talk to pirates and they ask you to drink a nasty beer

Use shovel on gloomstone to get it
Use gloomstone on drilling cart and use lever The cart will move to a stonewall and stop there Use the drill twice on stonewall to reveal a matchbox Take it and then go to switch point and use shovel on it Move drill and use it twice on another stonewall to reveal a secret passage
Don't go in yet as nothing you can do about it Go to forest and find the tree Talk to Jasmin and she refused to give you the necklace Use straw on tree and matchbox on the straw Take the stones she thrown at you
Go back to Esragoth and enter library

Asaveslot will be created for Claire's quest which is the second part of the adventure
Only after completing this will the game be finished
Think You Are Finished
The adventure is not done
To get the complete ending you must play through Claire's Second Scenario
If you beat Leon's first scenario you can then view the Resident Evil story from Claire's perspective
Many of Leon's previous actions will directly affect Claire's
Did Leon take the Submachine Gun dispose of the alligator partially open the Lab's Security Door
This plus new puzzles bosses and surprises await
Here are some tips to make it easier
Claire will begin in an unfamiliar area on the City Streets but once the first two areas are explored the scenery becomes familiar
The Second Scenario of this epic has identical puzzles as the first but some of the item locations are different
The first order of business for Claire is to get to the Main Hall of the RPD via the Crow Hall and Second Floor Storeroom Waiting Room
The bazooka is located on the desk next to the Typewriter and Computer
Note On the Second Floor F Main Hall Concourse the Unicorn Medal can be found at one end
The second order of business is to find the Valve Crank which is found in the East Office on the First Floor F
Access this area by returning to the Second Floor via the ladder and down the outside stairwell located on the far East side
From there use the Valve Crank and get ready for a huge surprise when returning
When you confront this new foe RUN
Proceed by getting the Blue Key Card in the room that can be accessed by putting out the fire
From here most of it is very familiar but there are some notable areas and events
Claire does not collect Chess Plugs but rather Colored Stones that are found in nearly every location where Leon found the Plugs
Claire has access to an additional area of the RPD
The broken door located next to the crashed helicopter can be opened using the Plastique Explosives and Detonator found after locating the Diamond Precinct Key purple
The Detonator is found in the West Office on the RPD First Floor F
The Plastique is found in the small room adjoining it
Combine the two and use it on the door
In this area is the office of Brian Irons
A panel will open behind his desk to reveal the spot to place the Colored Blocks
In the RPD Basement B Claire does not gain access to the Sewage Plant via the Garage
She must go down a Manhole that is found to the far East of the Basement beyond the Autopsy Room
In the Umbrella Lab Claire will start in a different place
First find the power switch for the Elevator
After Claire has escaped the Umbrella Lab the scene will change to the Transport Area
Find the Platform Key in the back of the Train
Proceed through gate over catwalk and look for the Electric Panel
Get two Fuses and head through white door
Place the Fuses and fight the Last Boss see Strategy below
The final conflict is almost identical to the first version of Resident Evil
Evade the charging beast as long as possible
A mysterious figure will throw you the Rocket Launcher
Equip it
One shot will do the trick
Escape to the Train
Strategy Extra The Special KeyFinding the Special Key is fairly easy
Just get to the RPD without picking up any items
Brad from the STARS Team is now a Zombie and will appear in the tunnel under the RPD entrance
First go inside the RPD and grab the Hand Gun Bullets from the central desk
Return outside and take 'im down
Search his corpse to find it
The Special Key is used on the locker in the Storeroom Darkroom
For Leon it will give him access to two changes of clothes
For Claire the Special Key will give her a new Western costume complete with authentic Six Shooter
Ranking System After beating Leon and Claire's scenarios the ranking screen will display a letter grade A F the number ofsaves and the time it took to complete the scenario
The main focus is clearly on the time clock but the number ofsaveswill also factor heavily into a point system that Resident Evil tracks internally
Try not tosavemore than times per scenario
The point system is also affected by the use of any weapons with infinite ammo in other words Special Weapons
You will not get an quot A quot grade with the use of Special Weapons
Saves Like a car racing around a track consider each time through the entire Resident Evil adventure as a lap
As you will see Resident Evil can track how many laps you have made through the game by the file you start your game with
The more laps the more secrets you may discover

So don't underestimate this game
Nemesis will come runningat you all the time
He won't rest until you die in his hand you will noticethat by the time he appear he will say DIE
For this faq is quite or very hard for me to explain because there's lot ofparts such as where the item location is will differs according to yourprogress in the game
So instead of telling you where the item is I rather notinclude that sorry
But don't worry the item can be obviously seen if you lookhard
This game is rather short but writting walkthrough is not thatshort especially come explaining something difficult although my explainationis not that good
The walkthrough section only emphasize on the important itemsuch as key
In other words the location of green herbs first aid spray etcis not discussed
I recommended you guys and gals go get all the Bio Hazard series as to exactlyknow what is happening
The objective in Bio Hazard is solely escaping fromthe Raccoon City

Secret There's lot of secret in Bio Hazard that might be easier to get comparing toBio Hazard or because you will get the secret after you finish the gamedespite your rank depending a little on your progress along finishing the game
Secret is obtained somehow based on your rank upon completing the game
Theamount of secret get is depend on the rank for instance the amount of extracostumes
For everytime you finish a game you will get an epilogue which comesin sequence
Don't worry you will get an epilogue that is different everytimeyou finish the game
In other words you need to complete the game times toget all the epilogue
Whew
I'll list out the secret that you can obtain in this game
Antique key used to open a locked door near where you first got the map
extra costumes a Jill's police uniform from Bio Hazard b

Shopping clothes white in color d Combat uniform black in color e Regina uniform from Dino Crisis
Mercenaries game something like the extra game from Bio Hazard Dual ShockVersion
unlimited weapons which is obtain by playing mercenaries game
Unlimited bullets which is obtain by playing mercenaries game Total secret
Mercenaries Game There's no walkthrough explaining how to get to a point here I only providebasic guide in this section
First of all you can choose three person from thefollowing i CarlosEquipment Machine gun Desert eagle Handgun's bullets advance healing herbs including curing poison ii
MikhailEquipment Rocket launcher Shotgun Shotgun shells Magnum Magnum's round advance healing herb including curing poison iii
NicholaiEquipment Handgun Knife blue herb first aid spray Each one of them has their own difficulty which obviously Mikhail is theeasiest among them
This part of game is not that easy where you just need to get to the targetdestination but you still can complete this game by just only heading to thedestination
In order to get more income when you arrive at the destination you are requiredto save civilian including your members Mikhail Carlos and Nicholai
There's some requirement on the time to save a person
For example the gamerequires you to come to a place which has civilian in a minimum requirement oftime
If you can't fulfil the condition the civilian will die there
I onlynotice that in order to save Brad you required minimum of to be able tosave him
Otherwise Brad will die below the restaurant
I'll list the location who and where the civilians members is No
Person Location
Fat guy Gas station
Young girl Newspaper office
Brad Below the restaurant
Policemen Sub station

Sales office

Pub shop Total civilians The fifth and sixth person depends on who you're controlling
It could be eitherCarlos Mikhail or Nicholai
For example if you choose Mikhail the person isCarlos
Saving civilians members will directly effect your grade and income
The income is approximately plus if you complete the game with saving allthe civilians members
In order to get grade A you will need to save all the civilians members andarrive at the target destination for approximately plus
Once everytimeyou save a civilian you will receives a reward such as bullets or first aidspray
I still don't know whether there's grade S in mercenaries game
Rank Grade The following rank is only for story mode despite its difficulty heavy orlight
In other words mercenaries game is not covered here
I don't haveexactly condition on how the rank is obtain the following is only myassumption Rank Condition E Might not exist or game over D Complete game over hrs plus maybe over savesC Complete game under hrs under savesB Complete game under hrs under savesA Complete game under hrs maximum saves no use of F Aid SprayS Complete game under hrs no save no use of F Aid Spray I assume that using unlimited weapon will NOT affect your rank
But I assumeusing first aid spray even time will directly affect your rank
Rank S mightonly exist in Bio Hazard and Resident Evil might don't have this rank
Ok I can't exactly lists out the condition but here's my result for yourreference Save UnlimitedNo

Return to Mysterious Island FAQ and Points List by Dave McB This is my attempt to show how to get the maximum points in this game
Credits I freely admit that all the solves except for the sliders are from walkthroughs by MaGtRo Dennis Matheson and Kheops
What I've done is to build on their fine work to be able to find a few additional points and some possibles
Honorable mention to Blitz Simon Hidid and Mr Haley for their walkthroughs
Notice I'm not including an e mail address because I prefer that any questions or comments be posted on the GameBoomers forum
After the opening cut scene the hint at the bottom of the screen leads us to right click and explore the inventory screen
Check the phone
Its battery is going dead so along with our objectives to find something to eat and a way off the island maybe we can find a way to charge the phone
Beach Go to the cliff to the left of the waterfall where you can see birds and see the ghost of Nemo
Clicking here Mina comments that she would need to be a monkey to get up there
Click on the high birds nest and Mina says quot It's too high quot not that she would need to be a monkey
Hint maybe you can reach it some other way
Click on the lower bird's nest
Take bird's egg Take rusty key Use rusty key on birds egg eat egg Note If you wait to cook the eggs you get no points
Eating one egg like this gives you one point
Eating any more eggs like this gets you no more points so only do one

Take turtle egg Go further on into the palm grove
Take palm trees Take green coconut Take coconut Use sandstone or knife on coconut take stripped coconut and coconut fibers Use sandstone on stripped coconut waste food Note You may think this is all wrong you shouldn't get a point for wasting food
But think about it
You're on a deserted island and you find a coconut
What would you first think of using to get through the very hard shell of a coconut
Right a stone
Only after you destroy the coconut might you consider using the knife
Use knife on green coconut then on stripped coconut eat coconut Take crab x Take porcupine Use knife on porcupine take porcupine without quills and quills Go back towards the arch
When you get to where the turtle was a coconut falls in front of you
Take green coconut Go back to the flat rock and then forward to the gap in the cliffs
Take metal plaque Nautilus Use knife on thorny bush take acacia thorns Take worm You can see curved thorns on a high branch but they're too high
Note You could take them now by combining the knife and the driftwood or do it later as I've done
Hint Remember another place that was too high
Go forward into the gap and hear Mina comment on the metal items on the wall
Go forward again up the rocks and click on the logs blocking your way to get the objective to eat reinforced
Use knife on vine take thin vine Take amadou Take forked branch Go back to the high branch with the curved thorns
Combine driftwood or forked branch with knife take knife with handle Use knife with handle on high thorny branch take curved thorns Go to the fire pit
Use knife or metal plaque with flint take lighter Note You can also use the metal plaque with the sandstone to make another knife useful if you broke the first one on the oysters and this second knife can also be used with the flint to make the lighter
Combine lighter or lens amadou or lichen and driftwood or palm trees take ready made fire Use acacia thorns on fire take curved acacia thorns Go back to the pool
Combine forked branch or driftwood thin vine curved thorns or curved acacia thorns and worms take fishing rod Take fish Now that we know how to reach high places go back to the bird's nests
Using the forked branch or the driftwood click on the high nest
Note the wooden fork from the mill won't work here
Take feather before it reaches the ground Note If you wait until it comes to rest you only get one point
Go back to the fire pit and eat
After Mina says that she has had enough and it's time to explore the island go back to the end of the gap in the cliff and move the logs
Plateau Go through the opening in the logs
The ground will shake again and you will hear the rumbling noise
From now on these will happen randomly
Take young palm tree Use knife on young palm tree take incomplete bow Go forward to a four way intersection
There are what look like telegraph or telephone poles beside the path ahead
Look left and Mina thinks she sees smoke
Look down to the left and see a plant
Use knife on plant take hibiscus fibers Combine incomplete bow and hibiscus fibers take bow Go to where Mina saw the smoke and discover it's steam from a hot spring
Mina comments that she can't drink it but she could use it to cook something
Look around to the right and see a tree with a gash in its trunk and a spider
Look down to the right and see a snake beside a plant
Use the forked branch to trap the snake
Use knife on gash in tree trunk take rubber Use knife on plant take medicinal plant Take the forked branch back and Combine forked branch and rubber take slingshot There are two paths from here we came in by the right one so take the left path
This takes us to a ruined bridge over a ravine
There is a pole next to it
Clicking on the pole gets the quot you'd need to be a monkey quot comment
To the left of the ruined bridge is a dead rat next to a plant
Use knife on plant take narcotic plant Take the left path back to the four way intersection
Go left to second four way intersection
Mina hears a commotion ahead but we'll go left to pick up some items We find ourselves below a short escarpment with a windmill on it and a monkey sitting on a branch
The stairs are broken
At the bottom of the stairs is a brick mould
Take brick mould Look down to the right past the tree trunk
Take pine kernel x Look up to the right past the path
Take note of the vines that Mina comments will need to be cut high up to be useful
Go back to the second four way intersection then to the right to a three way intersection to see what the noise was about
Mina gets scared by a scarecrow
Take dirty cloth Look down to the right
Take orange x Look left past the tree with the scarecrow
Take lemon x Look left past the two paths to see a plant
Use knife on plant take straw and wheat grains Combine straw and coconut fibers take mattress Look left and see monkeys throwing stones
Mina is out of range so ignor them for now
Turn degrees and go towards the shore of the lake
Look down to the left and Mina notices the tracks of a big cat in some clay
Take clay Combine clay and brick mould take unfired bricks Take clay again Note There are two types of repeatable actions one like what we did with the egg and oyster gives a point only the first time it's done the other like the clay and as we'll see later the water give a point each time
So some planning is needed in order to take these items as many times as possible
To the right of the clay is a tree stump
Use knife on tree stump take willow bark and wicker To the right of the tree stump is a plant
Use knife on plant take bamboo small shoots Combine bamboo small shoots quills and feather take arrows Combine bow and arrows take bow and arrows To the right of the plant is a large piece of bamboo
Take bamboo large piece Right again is another plant
Use knife on plant take bamboo medium piece And right again for another plant
Use knife on plant take elderberry pith Go back to the three way intersection where the monkeys throwing stones are
Note There are two ways to get past these monkeys
The simple way is to repair the stairs to the windmill and come in behind them which scares them away
This however gets you no points
The other way is to use the slingshot the bow doesn't work on the monkeys
Each time you hit one the green bar moves to the left and when the green is all gone so are the monkeys they run away
This isn't as hard as it may seem at first
Even though the green bar moves to the right whenever you haven't hit any monkeys like when there aren't any to shoot at you don't have to be especially quick just steady
Hit a couple of monkeys each time they pop up and eventually the bar will be empty don't even watch the bar concentrate on the monkeys
Chase monkeys away with slingshot Go ahead to the building
Click on the broken kiln it's broken and the bellows also broken
Note Clicking on the bellows triggers the seal on the beach Take logs Note Don't build a fire just yet
There's a repeatable action for points that can be done here
Go into the building and find Jep

Go forward turn right and go forward to the lake
Click on the lake and Mina will drink
Click again and she will take a swim
Use dirty cloth with lake take clean cloth Note You could do all four cloths now but there's another repeatable action for points that can be done here with the water
Go back to the beach
When Mina gets to the bottom of the gap she says quot What's that quot and sees birds circling something on the sand
Go to the start position and find a dead seal
Take dead seal Use knife on dead seal take seal fat seal skin and tendons Go to the fire pit and it will flare up when you look at it
Use clean cloth with fire take burnt cloth Note Repeatable action for points
Each time you burn a cloth in the fire you get a point
Burnt cloth can be used to make a fire so use one to make the rest of the fires and burn another cloth each time to have one for the next fire
Use unfired bricks on fire take bricks Use unfired bricks on fire take bricks Note Even though we didn't get points for making the second set of unfired bricks we did get a point for firing them
Time to repair the stairs at the windmill
Go up the gap to the first four way intersection turn right and go to the second four way intersection turn right and go to the stairs to the windmill
Use bricks on broken stairs to mill Go up the stairs
Take pickaxe at your feet Note There is a slapstick routine that can be seen here if you leave the pickaxe until Mina has been inside the mill
When she leaves watch out
Take metal fork Take strong cloth Take copper coins Take wooden fork Take grapes Try to repair the windmills sail that has no cloth with the strong cloth and the monkey on the branch won't let you
Mina can't do anything about it because the monkey doesn't trust her
There are no points to get inside the mill so go to the kiln
Use bricks to repair the kiln and sealskin to repair the bellows
Note Use the burnt cloth as one of the three elements and make a fire
Use the bellows to make the fire hotter

Click on lake take water in pot Note Another repeatable action for points
From now on I will be trying to maximumize the number of times I will be able to take water
Combine dirty cloth with water in pot take clean cloth Note This is why you need to keep at least one dirty cloth
Cleaning it using the water in a pot gets one point repeatable action for one point but it lets you take another water for an additional point
Take water again Use dirty cloth x with lake take clean cloth x Combine willow bark with water in pot take ready to heat remedy Take water Do same with medicinal plant and then take water again Note If you look to the right you will see a break in the rock wall that is closed with masonry
You can use the pickaxe now to break it open or wait for later and open it from the other side

Use the pickaxe to break open the bricked up wall to the right
Mina won't go in because it's too dark

Take giant oyster Use knife on giant oyster take pearl Go back to Granite House
If the monkey doesn't throw the rope ladder down enter and exit until he does
Note Yes we actuallywanthim to do this
Take rope ladder Combine the rope ladder with Jep and have him try to replace it
Well no returning this way
Go back to the plateau to the windmill
Time to do some milling
Combine Jep and alcohol take Jep offering a present Use Jep offering a present on the monkey in the tree and he'll let us fix the sail
Use the strong cloth on the arm that has no covering
Go into the mill and look up
Mina will comment that it's rusty
Combine Jep and seal fat take Jep holding a lump of fat Use Jep holding a lump of fat on the gears and the sail starts to turn
Look down and see an opening that we can interact with
Use hardened powder with mill take powder Use wheat grains with mill take flour Combine water flour egg sugar and grapes take ready to bake cake Go to the lake
Take water With the passage lit Mina can go in
Go further and Mina finds the monkey that threw down the rope ladder
Getting by is the same as for the one across the ravine
Use snake in a cage on monkey snake disappears Look down
Take lantern not working Use battery to charge lantern not working take lantern combine diving suit air tank helmet and lantern take diving suit Turn around and look down
Take gun Combine gun iron filings and powder take gun and ammunition Go back to the still
Use ready to bake cake with fire take cake Disassemble battery use lemon with still take alcohol And now for the mad chemist part
Use container of sulfuric acid and saltpeter with still take nitric acid Combine nitric acid potash clay and rods and tube take battery Combine nitric acid and glycerin take nitroglycerine Combine fuse clay and nitroglycerine take dynamite Disassemble container of sulfuric acid and saltpeter was only done to get another saltpeter combine elderberry pith nitric acid and sulfuric acid take pyroxylin guncotton Time to take care of that monster
Go to the opening in the floor and go down
Note There are three ways that I can find to handle this beast Shoot it with the gun hit it once Shoot it with the bow and arrows hit it twice or Use laced bait
All solutions give the same points zero
The only thing is that the picture is different if you shoot it you see it leaving with a hole in it if you use the bait you see it take it
If you decide to try shooting the monster swims the same zig zag course each time take a note of this because while you can aimatit with the gun you need toleadit when using the bow
Combine narcotic plant and porcupine without quills take laced bait Once the monster has been dealt with click on the water Mina will automatically put the diving suit on each time she comes to this spot and take an underwater trip to TA DA
The Nautilus
Climb aboard and look around
Nothing much to see or interact with except that lit button at her feet
Press the button and Release The Hounds
Mina escapes the killer robots by jumping into the water and going back to Granite House
Note Each robot can be disabled in a number of ways and some have a special way that gives points
Using the gun gives points
Using the bow gives points
Whenever possible I have used the special way
Go up to Granite House and try to exit out the front
That robot won't let you
Go to where the cannon is and click on the breech to open it
Place guncotton or powder in the breech
Take cannonball Put the cannonball in the breech and close it
Click on the wick on the cannon and your view changes to one looking down the cannon
You have a lit match as the cursor and the fuse is sticking up to the right of centre
There is a cross hair in the middle of the screen that can't be moved and you can see the robot flying around
Notice that at certain points in its flight path it crosses the cross hair
The objective here is of course to fire the cannon by lighting the fuse so that the cannonball and robot meet at the point marked by the cross hair
You need to experiment to get the timing
Note you can increase the effectiveness of the cannon by adding either not both nails or iron filings to create a shotgun effect
You get the same points so using only the cannonball just provides a personal challenge
Destroy robot with cannon Note We could leave by the front door now but I prefer to take the robot at the lake from behind actually I've never tried it from the other direction
Go to the back entrance ready The bow and arrows and exit
Destroy robot with bow and arrows Go to the remains of the robot
Take thruster Take damaged key Use screwdriver on damaged key take crystal Head inland to the four way intersection and notice another robot near the mill
We need to sneak around behind it but first time to get some more points
Go to the clay pit
Take clay Combine Jep and clay take clay again For another point disassemble Jep and clay and combine Jep and dynamite then disassemble Jep and dynamite Go to the three way intersection then forward to the kiln turn right and go forward to the mill
Note this takes us around behind the robot
Destroy robot with dynamite or use bow and arrows on vine supporting suspended branch of lightning struck tree Go down the stairs
Take thruster Take damaged key Use the screwdriver on the damaged key and take the crystal then go to the four way intersection
Notice the robot over by the ravine
If you go to the next four way intersection you will see that every now and then it touches the wire strung from the poles and there is an electrical discharge
Combine Jep and kite take Jep holding a kite Click Jep and his kite on the pole at the four way intersection near the windmill and he genius that he is will attach the wire from the kite to the cable on the pole
A bolt of lightning hits the kite runs down the wire along the cable and destroys the robot and the kite
Destroy robot at ravine with lightning Go to the ravine
Take thruster Take damaged key Use the screwdriver on the damaged key and take the crystal
Head for the beach but when you go through the open barrier you find that the metal bits on the walls have been activated and are lasers
Note Again there are different ways to get by Use dynamite to destroy it no points Use Jep and the screwdriver to open the box then solve the puzzle medium points or the following
Use lightning arrestor on beam pass beam Combine Jep with screwdriver take Jep holding a screwdriver Use Jep holding a screwdriver on the box on the wall and it will open
Placing the cursor over the box will cause the cursor to change to a magnifying glass showing that you can take a closer look
Clicking will bring up the following screen without the numbers
The objective is to move the dials so that there is a continuous line from the single bar on the right to all five lights on the left
Each of the buttons across the top control all the dials in the column below it while each of the buttons down the right side control all the dials in the row to the left of it
This puzzle seems to have an element of precision to it since I have received and points for solving it
I received the least points when I took many button clicks and made mistakes and the most when I used the least button clicks and made no mistakes
Click the four numbered buttons in any order Continue to the beach and find a broken robot
Open the control panel and input the code
Assign numbers from one up to the letters in the word Nautilus from left to right N A U T I L U S all other letters
Put the correct numbers in the bottom to match the letters that are in the top
Note The letter quot u quot appears twice so both numbers assigned to it will work
Additional note All these code puzzles using the letters from the word quot Nautilus quot the numbers quot quot or the letter quot N quot have their solution in plain sight
Above the working area on each screen is either a plaque saying quot Nautilus quot or in the case of the two sliders to form the letter quot N quot an example of the letter can be seen
Solve code at broken robot Take thruster Take damaged key Use screwdriver on damaged key and take the crystal
We now have four of them so Combine empty key and four crystals take repaired key Note We have the key so we could enter the sub but there are more points to get
Go to the wrecked boat and look around
Take damaged key Note You can take out its crystal or not you get no points for it
Ready the bow and arrows since this is another robot that I can't find a special way to destroy and go to the pool
Destroy robot at arch with bow and arrows Go through arch
Take thruster Take damaged key Go to where you found the dead seal
Take thruster Go to the front entrance to Granite House and use Jep to re set the rope ladder
Go back to the Nautilus and find a robot is patrolling her deck
Note The Kheops walkthrough says that you can sneak past this robot
To do it you need to be fast solve the code and go down the stairs before the robot shoots you
If you do it youdoget points for solving the code but youdon'tget any more points for sneaking by the robot so you end up losing points
Additional note If you are fast enough to get downstairs without having the robot shoot at you I've been able to get safely down even when the robot shoots but I haven't gotten down without it shooting does the game only consider this as a successful sneak and award points
I'm going to keep trying
Destroy robot at sub with bow and arrow Solve code Just add to the number that is there
Nautilus Entrance area Go downstairs and find yourself in a caged area with a locked gate
There is a lever on the wall to the right that can be interacted with but you can't reach it
Try using Jep on it and Mina will call him back because he might get hurt on the sharp metal
Combine Jep and a thruster take Jep hovering on a thruster Jep pulls the lever and the gate opens
Go to forward two steps and see that the stairs down are blocked by a piece of floor plate that is hanging down
Use a thruster on the floor plate and see that it's not enough so use another
The stairs are now open but return to go back one step and look down to see a beam that can be interacted with
Click on the beam and it will move to form a bridge to the raised floor plate and a door
Go to the door and you find another code puzzle
This appears to be another precision puzzle because making mistakes got me points while making no mistakes got me points
The picture on the left shows where the missing pieces go and the one on the right shows how many rotations each piece needs in order to be correct
Solve upper door code When you solve the code the door opens
Look down and see a hole in the floor that you can jump down through
But we're going for points so go back and down the stairs
There is another code to break here but it's fairly simple
Numbers get entered in the upper area and letters in the lower one
After you punch in a number the key pad changes to letters and after you punch in a letter it changes back to numbers and so on
The number to be entered is and after punching in a digit there will be only one letter on the key pad that can be found in the word Nautilus
Click that letter and continue
Solve lower door code Captain Nemo's private quarters The door opens to reveal another robot but this one wants to talk its sensors have failed and it thinks Mina is Captain Nemo
Click on the robot to continue the conversation and Mina tries to order it to lower the shield but the robot needs to confirm that it's talking to the captain
There are two ways to do this Answer seven questions before making two mistakes gets you no points or Figure out how to play Nemo's favourite piece on the organ gets you points
Choose to do the questions later and take a step forward
Look under the right side of the sofa
Take pearl Go to the right to the smashed case and click the beam to move it
You could put one of the pearls in the case but you get no points for it
The pearl only needs to be here if you are answering the questions and the pearl is one of the answers
Go to the left to the safe
There's another letter N puzzle here
This is a slider type puzzle where the four squares around each button rotate clockwise with each press of that button
Here we're forming a N inside a circle
My solution is Click button three times Click button three times Click button one time Click button one time Click button one time Click button two times Click button three times Click button one time Solve slider With the safe open click on the two handles to left one opens the portholes right one opens the organ
Go to the organ and place the musical score below the two that are already there
Pull the handle to hear the tune
To solve this number the keys that work not all of them do try them from left to right in order both black and white
You will end with keys numbered from to
Then play them as follows First stanza Second stanza Third stanza Final stanza Note You only need to play the final part for the robot to accept Mina
Play organ The robot accepts Mina as Captain Nemo
Mina orders it to lower the shield and then calls her mother to send the rescue people
Game over
Questions I'm still left with possible additions Can you get points for catching the feather as stated in the Kheops walkthrough Can the bird's egg be caught
Are there special ways to destroy the robots at the lake and arch
Is there a three click solution for the laser beam power puzzle that gives points Can you get points for sneaking by the robot at the sub I finished with the makings to make a fourth fire and no place to put it
Would have been nice to take another burnt cloth

I would like to thank Dennis Lepine and Chris Sutton for their help
Most of all I would like to thank Knut Mueller for the wonderful world of Rhem
Rhem A world full of inventive original and logical puzzles
A world of pure art
In RHEM you entered the vast world of Rhem and were left stranded with no means of escape
You explore Rhem to find the reasons you were brought here who are here and what is this world
At a certain point in the game you realize that someone left parts of a message and when collected will be your pass to leave this world
In RHEM you were asked to do a task by Zetais to find an artifact hidden in an underground part of Rhem
He gives one key and you have to find the other keys
One of the keys to be found was kept by Kales Zetais' brother and the one that left the part message in Rhem
These keys will lead to the artifact
Upon getting a picture of the artifact and giving it to Zetais you leave the underground part of Rhem
Now Zetais has written that he has deciphered the artifact
He gives a letter for Kales to gain entry to a still unexplored area of Rhem
He also gives the information to help you in this exploration
Hint Be sure to check back of doors and walls to see if there are hidden codes or entryways
There are a lot of places to explore in this new world
Be sure to explore first and examine things out
This walkthrough will concentrate on one area at a time We will try to open an area study and explore that area and eventually search for the relic

The entrance

The north part where the rail car stopped has areas The building to the right that has floor levels
Each level has doors

Then logic follows in correlating what is observed a color a number an item to the puzzle
Compass If the arrow points to the top it is pointing north
If the arrow points left it is east
If the arrow point right it is west
If the arrow points down it is south
This is based on the compass pointing always to show true north
When you turn away from true north the compass needle still stays pointed north
So if you face east the needle pointing to true north is on your left
If you face west the needle pointing to true north is on your right
If you face south the needle is behind you

Check all the panels and see what action happens with the silo
Triangle with circles and triangle with overlapping circles This is the panel at right front with button
When the button is pressed and there is a number on the panel at left side it starts to drop the stones out of the silo
We can gather that circles are numbers
Overlapping circles are the sum of numbers
Triangle with circles This is the panel at front left
This is a random number and is related to the number of stones dropped from the silo
Since circles mean numbers the left number is a separate digit from the right number
Triangle with one circle This is the panel at back right
It counts how many stones are dropped
There is also a reset button
This icon is similar to the triangle with a red ball seen at the East water area
Remember that that triangle has below it

Take note of that number
Get the red ball The clue from the east water area states and if you have played with the panels earlier you will know that every th item dropped from the silo is a red ball
Press the left front panel as many times you want until you get numbers that add up to or close and less than
For example is seen on the panel

The panel programs the silo to drop balls now
Be sure that the back right panel is reset to zero so that it records the count correctly
Press the button at front right to start the silo
If you have managed to program items to drop from the silo the red ball will be on top of the pile under the silo
Go around the path and pick up thered ball
If you can only program the left front panel to be close but less than and have dropped those items from the silo select a new set of number that will get
I did then and then on one replay
If you programmed more than the ball will be under the pile of stones and cannot be recovered
Start over
Do this process until you get the red ball

Triangle with circles and triangle with overlapping circles This is the panel at right front with button
When the button is pressed and there is a number on the panel at left side it starts to drop stones out of the silo
We can gather that circles are numbers
overlapping circles are the sum of numbers
Triangle with circles This is the panel at front left
This is a random number and is related to the number of stones dropped from the silo
Since circles mean numbers the left number is a separate digit from the right number
Triangle with one circle This is the panel at back right
It counts how many stones are dropped
There is also a reset button
This icon is similar to the triangle with a red ball seen at the East water area
Remember that that triangle has below it
If you start the whole process of dropping stones reset the panel note that every th item dropped from the silo is a red ball
We need to get that ball
Triangle with a crossed out circle This is the panel at back left If the whole process panels are not activated press this button and then press the panel that drops stones at front right a different sound is heard
During activation all panels are clicked on and after a certain number of stones are dropped notice that a sound and a flash are seen heard
Take note of that number
Get the red ball The clue from the east water area states and if you have played with the panels earlier you will know that every th item dropped from the silo is a red ball
Press the left front panel as many times you want until you get numbers that add up to or close and less than For example is seen on the panel

The panel programs the silo to drop balls now
Be sure that the back right panel is reset to zero so that it records the count correctly
Press the button at front right to start the silo
If you have managed to program items to drop from the silo the red ball will be on top of the pile under the silo
Go around the path and pick up thered ball

So it would be wise to save your game before you start the game
Here is the solution to solve the game If nothing happens you didn't solve the game correct
In that case load your saved game and start all over again
If something does happen you did solve the game correct
In that case it would be wise to save your game again so you won't have to solve this again

Step onto the circular part of the floor to find out that it actually is another transmitter that can be activated somehow
From this point use your laser pointer on the characters
Walk towards the characters
To activate the transmitter at the center of the room you have to activate some of the characters in the correct order so that they together form a word
The first question of course is what this word might be
Well that isn't that difficult after all
Notice that the one but last character is already lit
Make a note of this character
Now open the section Script table in Mondra's notebook
If you look at the character you just lit you'll see that this character corresponds with the Y
Now remember the game with the colored tiles which is called theYlohim game
So this can only mean that the correct word should be Ylohim
Of course you can make a note of each and every character to form this word
The easier way is to simply follow my instruction
Number the three rows from top to bottom A B and C Number the characters on every row from the left to the right
I know I know the bottom row has only characters
Believe me that doesn't matter
Here we go again
One fair warning don't forget to get your laser pointer from your inventory every time you select the next character
If you make a mistake all of the lit characters will go out and you have to start all over again
Press the characters with the laser pointer in this order C B B A A B
I have put the C between brackets because this one is already lit so you won't have to point to this character now
I only mention it just in case you do something wrong and have to start all over again
In that case you have to point to this character
After you have done this correct the transmitter at the center of the room will be activated
Step backward and step onto the activated transmitter
From beneath the monitors get the metallic object
Look at the positronic beneath the monitors
Use the picture of Kato da Trumor on the positronic

Links to more help RIDDLE OF THE SPHINXHint Based Location Oriented Experts WalkthroughWritten by John T Burt Copyright REVIEW If you treat of Riddle of the Sphinx as an investigation of a major crime sans people you will be on the right track
The fact that it is in a pyramid is only relevant in the types of clues found
It could just as easily have been in an abandoned skyscraper on another world with different types of clues Only about in of the things you will find have any relevance
You can take most of the important ones with you but not all of them which is frustrating
Some of the clues you can take with you are not particularly important
I tried keeping notes on paper and taking screen shots
But less than half way through I had over screen shots and sheets of paper so I gave up and just used a walk through as my notes
You will need to take some notes though so have paper and pencil handy
This walk through will remind you when to write
Stick with it be careful and you can probably figure it out with minimal help The game does take a while to play
I think I spent hours inside the tent alone
All told it took me about hours to play the game at about minutes a day
An hour was about all I could take before I got bored or frustrated
Never the less it was an interesting investigation There is plenty to explore and the scenery is good
The exploration is a little confusing at times
The point and click movement process sometimes changes direction automatically making it difficult to figure out where you are and what the layout is
WALKTHROUGH STRUCTURE This is basically an expanded experts walkthrough
Initial entries for each location give only hints
The hints are scaled from the general to the specific
Those are followed by the goal for each area
The actual solution to an area is included as a spoiler if necessary
Full spoilers are included at the end of the file so stay away from the end unless you need it This game is adequately linear so following the location headings should not be a big spoiler Any walkthrough is a spoiler but this one should be less of a spoiler than a typical walkthrough
GAME GOAL At the very end of this file is the overall game goal
GIL'S TENT IRRELEVANT MATERIAL Some provide hints but they are not critical
The things on top of the desk are mainly for atmosphere
If you lie down and go to sleep you can read the paper under the pillow using the candle
All the info on the tapes except for Gil's specific data is unimportant HINT You need to find and listen to three audio tapes tape artifacts tape tape to get three critical math clues HINT To get into the desk you need to find the key
There are hints in the shaving mirror and in other places HINT You will need matches to get the key HINT The top shelf of the desk has tape location numbers which can speed up using the tapes HINT You can't take the star charts with you
Remember main patterns on the older one HINT Find a scrap of paper with biblical reference numbers and the bible itself to figure out the lock combination HINT You might need to read the lock instructions if you don't know how to use one HINT When working on the lock be careful using the dial and do not open the latches until after the padlock opens GOAL I think the only thing you actually need to play the game is Gil's campus ID number
But you should also open the chest to get the Translation Scroll and tape
It will also help a little if you note the main pattern s on the oldest star chart
Gil advises you to use the tablets as your first clue
Make a note of what they look like on the Translation Scroll and it might save you dying a few times later in the game SPOILERS Gil's ID and the actual combination are at the end of this file
Tape says Add the day number plus the number of doves plus the number of digits Artifacts tape says Add the number of young bulls to and subtract the number of male goats Tape says Number of years minus The biblical reference numbers are R L R passage speaks about doves passage about one young bull and one male goat passage about the age of fifty The first combination number is ambiguous it is

The final hot spot is on a grate HINT Take the route to the Queens chamber after reading the note GOAL To find and read Gil's note for the math instructions SPOILER The note says to add together the last digits of Gil's campus ID number and the date the scaffolding was constructed
QUEEN'S CHAMBER IRRELEVANT material As near as I can tell there is no critical data in the journal on the table with the control panels
Near the end it does have some hints about what you are doing and how to do it HINT The Cheoptronic is on top of the boxes
Get it first HINT There are square holes in the walls HINT The Cheoptronic is smaller than it looks HINT There are three power switches on the control module on the table HINT There is a message in the bottom module that has hints
The journal has some hints near the end HINT The drive of the Cheoptronic is very long and the unit gets stuck four times before you reach the end
The walls also get smooth near the end HINT When you reach the end a special message will appear on the control module GOAL To use the Cheoptronic robot to open some doors SPOILERS The Cheoptronic is smaller than it looks and is used in the hole in the wall near the table it is an airshaft
Gil's math instructions can be interpreted at least ways

Frustratingly slow
ROUTE Just leave the elevator go through the door and approach the mosaic cobra to enter the start of the large maze

Unfortunately the disks are only approximate representations of the maze and are not really maps
There is no true map of the maze HINT The god you are working with is Anubis the Jackal HINT Follow the black headed Jackal Anubis statues through the maze GOAL To reach the Sacred Pool in the center SPOILER Unfortunately the click and move engine used in this game makes it difficult to map the maze and keep track of where you are

Warp works on the way out HINT The large pipe in the wall is a short cut back to the maze start HINT Click on a locking pin to open the grate HINT You had to add sand to get the elevator to go down
Now you want to go up GOAL To get the six doors open and get keys SPOILER Return to the red and white standpipes
Each has a symbol at the top
Use the valves to put the correct number of balls in the red and white areas matching the symbols from the statue valves
See the end of the file for the combinations
When done return to the pool and open the doors by clicking on the wheels
Go down the long long tunnels and get each key in the room at the end
That's all there is to do in each
It's kind of boring
Warp works on the way back if you can find the arrows
When you have all six keys climb up into the large pipe and follow it to the start of the maze
Click on a locking pin on one side to open it
Back in the lotus elevator dump the sand from the pot to go up

It has one thing in common with the Sacred Scroll HINT The Sacred Scroll looks like the door HINT On each of the Scrolls is a symbol
The same symbol is on the Sacred Scroll HINT Maybe the positions of the symbols on the Sacred Scroll are important GOAL To get inside the Sphinx SPOILER Open each of the Scrolls and note the name of the scroll and the symbol
Open the Sacred Scroll and note which circle each symbol is in and which land it goes to
Insert each key in the position indicated on the Sacred Scroll
See the end of this file for the locations
SPHINX DIG SITE STAR CHARTS HINT If you click on the wrong blue circle you will die HINT There is no pure solution to this HINT The correct star pattern was on the Star Chart in Gil's tent HINT Four constellations can be eliminated they were in the telescope room HINT Of the lands which one are you in and what is its star pattern HINT The correct circle matches the position of the key of this land HINT We are at the Sphinx which is in Giza HINT The star pattern for the Sphinx is Orion GOAL To get inside the Sphinx SPOILER Click on the top left blue circle
THE END The ending is long and a bit weak
Once inside Gil will come up from behind and give you a boring lecture
Then you can open the chest and click on the inside to end the game

Look at the door raised by chains has a circular gold maze map above it and across the fire box
Taking a peek inside a gold coiled circlet is seen lying on an altar
This door looks similar to the first side room entered with the lever handle and the statue of standing Pharaoh Go back to that room turn left and go forward to the very first room pass the single sitting statue and by the entrance to the Queen's chamber
Lower the lever handle and while the stone door is rising get out of the room
Trek back to the similar door at the end of the hallway

Click once on the cobra wheel and opening on the wall is revealed
Revolving Maze Looking at the Maze map the entry at the bottom of the map is where the cobra wheel stand is situated
Enter and go to the next opening at right on the other side of the circle maze
This is the entry on the top of the maze map
Another beautiful chamber is revealed Go back out to the corridor and turn the cobra wheel once more
Enter the revolving maze again
This time the maze exit is blocked everywhere as shown by the maze map as it is now Go out again and turn the cobra wheel for the third time
Enter again to see what will be revealed by the third entry shown in the Maze map
Primitive Chamber III This looks like the exit on the bottom right of the maze map
Get theSacred Cullon the altar
The skeleton on the left corner of the room is holding a scroll
Pick up theFlume Scroll
Go back out and turn the cobra wheel once more
Lotus Dome Chamber Turning left in the maze an exit back to the beautiful chamber seen the first time the cobra wheel was turned is revealed
Enter
In the middle of the chamber a giant closed lotus is seen
A stand with holes is before it
Place gold harp key on the stand
The giant lotus opens up and a throne carried by statues is revealed
A pot is set before the throne Turn back and while facing the exit go to the right side aisle and find an intricate chest that opens to a star to sun contraption
Go to the other side aisle and at the end of the hallway stands a sand dispenser held by statues
Place the sacred cull on the top of the pot at the bottom of the dispenser and slide the lever to the right
Bring the grain full cull back to the lotus throne and empty it to the pot
Do this a total of times
You will sit on the throne and descend
Get off and click on the stone door
Maze Go through and see a mosaic cobra
Look behind the cobra and see a hole covered by a wooden frame
Keeping in mind the gold maze map seen at the Hidden Chamber up in the King rsquo s secret room with Anubis Jackal at the center start on the maze
Take the right passageway while facing the cobra

Notice the maze pattern just look for Anubis and go to him
Sacred Pool Before entering the sacred pool chamber go to the column on the right side of the hallway and check the flume contraption on the wall
This is similar to the Flume scroll found with the sacred cull
Drain the pool Go back to the other entry framed by columns and enter the sacred pool
Anubis statues surround the sacred pool
Check each statue
At the base of each statue icon on a wooden wheel and circles similar to the flume scroll are seen
Turn each wooden wheel raising it up
The water is drained from the pool Gates Go down the pool
Look around the different gates
In close up view turn the wooden wheel of each gate
Only the Giza candelabra wheel turns and opens the barred opening at the bottom Flume room Go back to the contraption on the wall outside the pool area
The mechanics behind the contraption shows that by turning the tap on top water is added and by using the tap at the bottom water is drained
Arrange the red and white balls on each tap based on the icons on the top of the square pipe the flume scroll and the icons seen on the wooden wheel at the foot of each Anubis statue

An Egyptian Adventure Commentary amp WalkthroughbySoren Andersen Commentary The world s literature throughout the ages contains a vast amount of writing on Egypt s pyramids and the Sphinx from scholarly disser tations to crackpot assertions and speculation
A few of the more factual of these articles that have been culled from the Internet and are appended to the end of this document mainly because they include names that appear in the game s preamble not of course the fictional Gil Geoffreys and to actions and journals that are encountered in the game
The timeline that appears in the game s introductory video is also appended but keep in mind that it is part of the game and may be factually tainted for that reason
It is assumed that before beginning the game you have read the Prologue that appears on pages and of the game booklet user manual from the CD jewel case
The game cursors there are a lot of them interface and inventory are described on pages of the game booklet but some amplification may be helpful when the hand cursors appear with a circular arrow superimposed it means that a VR condition i e continuous panning will be initiated on the next click which may show a ordm rotated square hold down the left mouse switch and move the mouse whereupon the square becomes a bullseye and you may begin panning at a speed controlled by the cursor position
There will be small arrows appearing as well
The bullseye may show without the appearance of the square there is a certain amount of inconsistency in this whole operation
You may have to be in a particular area of the screen for the VR operation to be available
When you pan over a location in which there is an item or location of interest a hand appears on the bullseye and you may stop and click to move forward to explore it
You will quickly get used to this but the square and bullseye are not described in the booklet When you wish to retrieve an item from inventory double click on it When you start a return along a passageway or stairway that has taken many clicks to traverse there are plenty of these carefully move your cursor around and you will usually find the arrow indicating that you may warp back in one step to the passage beginning
The walkthrough that follows does not give specific answers to the challenges presented but it is pretty specific on how the answers are obtained You can get killed in a few of the game situations but not if you pay close attention to the clues
Walkthrough At various times up to about the middle of the twentieth century much excavation was done on the Giza Plateau including excavation of the body of the sphinx previously unsuspected after long ago being covered by sand over the centuries which actually preserved the soft limestone from the abrasive desert weathering
The game takes place some years in the future and prior to this future date violent sandstorms had again covered much of the excavations including the sphinx body so that only the head was visible and the body had to be uncovered once again
Later you will find a journal with more about this
You know from the Prologue in the game booklet that after all this excavation archeologist Gil Geoffreys discovered an ancient scroll purported to reveal the storied secret of the Sphinx and that for translating it and thus learning the directions to the secret he has released a curse that has resulted in his death
Before this happened his colleagues turned against him so he hid the scroll and then sent for you to carry on
As the game opens you are in a helicopter flying over Gil s campsite near the Sphinx and you land there at a temporary helipad
You will very soon find a map of the area as you investigate Gil s tent an exploration that is the first order of business as you need to see what he has left that might be of help in your quest
Leave the helicopter and go to his tent the farthest one of the group
Gil s Sphinx Tent The tent has been left in some disarray not too surprising when one is under a deadly curse
Spilled coffee empty food cans scattered papers
He must have left clues so that you can find the hidden scroll
A reasonable place to start searching is his desk
There are several items on the desk that may be examined but the first thing you notice is a letter warning of a cutoff of expedition funding
Bummer
There is a tape cartridge on which is written presumably by Gil A Message For You My Old Friend
Except for recording the tape player next to it is fully functional so open the top and load the cartridge
You might have to first rewind tape to be sure it is at the beginning
This also applies to subsequent tapes
Adjust the volume control then use the Play button to listen to the tape and get information from Gil about the curse the scroll and his colleagues
Gil's advice Assume nothing examine everything and make exhaustive notes
When his message is finished remove the tape and place it back on the desk
The desk is locked but the desk writing board may be pulled out and on it is taped a sheet of paper with three sets of notations that are probably important
Continue exploring
Gil s wash stand offers no clues though the mirror seems focused on the stove
Next to the bed is a stand on which is to be found a candle and a matchbook below these are four books
One is a book about Egyptian monuments written by Gil and bookmarked to pages that you should read and remember for later reference
Another book is about many Egyptian hieroglyphics that is interesting to scan the third is a bible that falls open to the Book of Numbers and the fourth book contains some mathematical observations on a couple of the pyramids observe the drawing and description of the Great Pyramid because you will explore it soon
Under the pillow on the bed is a sheet of paper
It appears to be blank so put it back
In the center of the bed is a box that contains a watch with the crystal broken and that is stopped at Gil s passport and his billfold
The latter contains several ID cards the numbers of which you should probably record exhaustive notes
Behind one card is a scrap of paper on which there are three sets of notations with the same RLR prefaces as those on the desk writing board
Above this notation is the word Numbers and each notation consists of two numbers separated by a colon which you as a scholarly person recognize as how chapter and verse in the books of the bible are designated
It is no coincidence that the bible fell open to the Book of Numbers so return to it and look up the locations indicated each of which contain some reference to a particular number and again should be so noted and correlated
On the stove is a pot in which there is a residue of something that Gil cooked it has all the appearance and smell of stew The large trunk is secured with a combination padlock and if you look in the trash you will find the packaging in which the lock came
You can turn the packaging over and read the directions for opening the padlock which is the standard method of turning the dial right left and right again
Aha
RLR you have found two such references the desk writing board and the billfold scrap
So you know how to open the lock what you need the lock combination numbers
Now pretend that you are tired and you need sleep as night is falling click on the pillow to watch it fall
Click on the pillow in the darkness to wake up in the middle of the night
You need light so get a match from the matchbook drag it on the matchbook striking strip and light the candle
Now if you look at the paper from under the pillow with the candlelight behind it you can make out a doggerel poem by Gil about stewing over a key
You can think further about this in the morning so click on the pillow to go back to sleep then click once more on the pillow to wake up in the morning
The poem intimates that you investigate the stew on the stove
Light another match and hurry to the stove click on the knob to turn on the gas then light the burner
Look in the pot and very shortly a key appears
Turn off the stove pick up the key and go to the desk where you can unlock all four drawers
Put the key back in the pot as you won t need it any more
Now to investigate the desk drawers
In the center drawer you will find two star plots with constellations indicated and also the annotated site layout diagram referred to above
On the left the top drawer holds two tapes and an unimportant sketch of two pots the center drawer holds Gil s scrapbook the few pages of which you can quickly read and in the bottom drawer is another tape
Pull out the desk writing board
The top notation with the circled R says Tape and has four digits in a set of squares
Get this tape from the top left drawer and put it in the tape player
Be sure the tape is rewound then set the tape player counter to zero by clicking on the left end of it
Fast forward so the counter reads the number of the four digits or perhaps a little less
Now play the tape and Gil will give you the clue you need to determine the first number of the trunk padlock by using the corresponding bible quotation
Repeat this operation with the other two tapes and you will have the padlock combination
Put the tapes back in the drawers
Using the procedure described on the back of the padlock packaging open the padlock
This can be a finicky set of steps
Here is how it is done Get a closeup of the padlock Place the cursor on the dial where it become a hand showing aT Hold down the left mouse button and spin the dial to the right clockwise a couple times
Release the mouse button whereupon the hand cursor shows anR Hold down the mouse button and turn the dial clockwise to the first number of the combination
Release the button and anLappears on the hand cursor Hold down the mouse button and turn the dial counterclockwise past the first number to the second one
Release the mouse button and theRreappears on the cursor Hold down the mouse button and turn the dial clockwise directly to the last number
Release the mouse button If you have the correct combination and if you have carefully followed the above steps you will hear a click and after a short pause the lock will open
Unsnap the two hasps and click on the trunk top to open it
Click on the book inside to get a closeup then click on it again to open it to find a scroll in the hollowed out pages
Pick up the scroll and examine it
When you put it in inventory the name that appears for it is Translation Scroll
Take the tape from the trunk to the tape player be sure it is rewound to the beginning set the tape counter to zero and listen to Gil s halting and none too lucid reading of the scroll
He says that there is something that you should use as your first clue tableture it sound like six of them and indeed on the right side of the scroll are depicted six headstone style tablets
Gil admits to not having a complete understanding of what the scroll says and that is indeed reflected in his taped message
The Atlantean writing about which he speaks is a mystery as is any connection to Horus the Red whatever that might mean
Confusing
The foregoing translation is a ploy by Gil to put off anyone his colleagues presumably who chance to have found the tape
Fast forward to read on the counter and listen to Gil again
He is now far from being hesitant and confused
He clearly and authoritatively translates the four lines of hieroglyphics and says the curse points to the tableture on the right side of the scroll pointing out that some have three scarabs on them and some do not
The tablets as pictured are cursed avoid them
The Atlantean references in the first part of the tape are to be taken seriously
Sphinx Well you ve found the scroll that Gil hid so now explore the Sphinx dig site
Leave the tent cross the plank bridge to the front of the sphinx and go down the ramp between the statue s front legs to the excavation floor
You could examine the groups of barrels but there is nothing to find in these
You could also walk all around the excavation but the quickest way to the tunnel in the side of the Sphinx that is indicated on the site layout diagram is to go under the plank bridge
On the way you will see on one of bridge support planks a construction date
You may as well record this date in line with Gil s dictum of making exhaustive notes
Continue on to the opening in the side of the Sphinx
Enter and go to the end of the tunnel
Someone has conveniently left an operating lantern here and by its light you can see an enormous portal that resembles the hexagon at the bottom of the Translation Scroll except that there is a scarab pictured in the center and in addition there is a golden circle next to each of the ones at the apexes of the hexagon
You can t do anything here but observe and since you have done that you might as well go back to the helicopter and fly to the Great Pyramid for further investigation
When you land go to the nearby camp
Great Pyramid base camp There is not much here a plank bench over some barrels under a canvas tarp some boxes a shovel
On the bench is a water container and a can of gasoline
Check to see if there is any water by turning the spigot near the bottom of the container
Yup there is
Water runs into the sand leaving a strange depression
Waste some more water on the sand
The depression deepens
Run a lot of water and you uncover a broken container in which there is another scroll
This one again shows the hexagon of circles each circle containing a clearly visible icon that has the appearance of Arabic writing but is probably the Atlantean symbols to which Gil referred in his reading of the Translation Scroll
There is also the scarab as seen on the portal
Inventory calls this find a Sacred Scroll
Behind the camp is a sand ramp between fences that leads to the pyramid entrance
Proceed up this ramp and to save yourself a trip back take the can of gas with you
When you get to the entrance fill the generator with gas and press the green button to start it
Now you have lights for the pyramid corridors
You may wish to consult the Great Pyramid diagram at this point
After you enter the pyramid and advance some distance up the passageway your progress will be stopped by a sandslide that completely fills the passage
Go back a couple clicks until you achieve VR mode then look upward and you will find in the roof of the passage another one that leads to the inner chambers
Move along this corridor until you come to some ladders and the corridor branches one branch going straight ahead and the other going upward
Look behind the ladders to find a grate which when swung back will reveal a note from Gil with an important message
Then take the upper passage to the King s Chamber where you will see nothing but an uncovered empty sarcophagus
Return back to the ladders and move through the straight ahead passage to the Queen s Chamber
Queen s Chamber In this chamber there is a table on which is some electronic equipment and to the right are the equipment carrying cases
On the table with the equipment is a journal kept by an unnamed member of Gil s expedition team
The sporadic entries cover several months and while reading it is somewhat difficult you really should take the time to do so
The robot used to explore the shaft this device is called a cheoptronic in the journal is on the carrying cases and the opening of the square shaft down which it is to go is in the wall next to the electronics
The shallow niche mentioned in the journal is in the wall to the left of the square shaft opening
Pick up the robot unit and place it in the shaft opening then get a closeup of the electronics which has three units a power supply at the top a control unit with monitor below it and a data unit at the bottom
Press the switches to turn the three units on
Press the Library switch on the right side of the control unit and you will get the robotic view of the shaft
Systematically press all switches on the data unit
Switch gives operating instructions for the control unit to run the robot several switches produce remarks from previous runs and many yield blank displays
You will may well find the operation of the robot to be none too easy not to say frustrating
In theory you move the unit forward or backward by grasping the rightmost of the two switches on the control unit and dragging it up or down and the leftmost switch to jog it loose when it gets stuck on rubble encountered on the shaft floor
Most of the time it rolls right over these pebbles but occasionally it does get stuck particularly at the beginning of the shaft journey
This is a very long shaft and takes a while to traverse you just have to keep at it
You can judge your progress by watching the signal strength level as it appears on the data unit panel
It starts at and you will be near the end when it reads
Also when you near the end of the shaft the character of the wall changes
A program glitch may result in the meter resetting if so just keep trying
Should you experience a lot of trouble you may wish to save your game periodically as you move forward
When you get to the door at the shaft s end you will be asked to enter the digit code that you got from Gil s note that was behind the grate in the passage by the ladders
Use the data unit s keys for this code entry and the robot s hydraulics then push the door back the scene shifts to the shallow niche in the Queen s Chamber where the back recedes and it is no longer shallow
Exploring this now deep niche you will find an opening near the floor at the back but do not enter as you do not have all that you need at this time
As it happens there have been other wall movements
Return the King s Chamber
King s Chamber A stone block behind the sarcophagus has moved inward slightly
Click on it to push it farther in and follow the passage to the real tomb of Cheops
Gold everywhere
Under the foot of the structure on which the king s mummy is resting is another passageway that leads to the King s Gallery a series of several chambers in which there is much to see and do
When you emerge from this tunnel into the Gallery you will be facing a cobra lamp
Turn left and go along the Gallery around the corner to an open archway
Above the arch is the representation of a chair or more likely a throne
Enter
Throne Chamber The room you find is rather messy
Your cursor will lead you to a squat vessel in one corner from which you can remove the cover and pick up an object the inventory calls the Heraldic Key
In another corner is a golden disk on which is formed a maze
Chances are that this is important
Or not
There is another room off this one
Go in there and see the throne that gives the chamber its name
Ever wanted to sit on a throne
Click on this one do so
Your weight on the throne moves a statue in a corner
Enter yet another room behind the statue
In the middle of the floor is a strange appearing device that the inventory says is the Royal Scope
Spotlighted on the wall is an icon a rectangle with six spikes protruding upward
For want of a better appellation call it a comb
From the way it is displayed it must very important
Go back through the rooms to the Gallery and on to the next open archway
Knife Chamber Over this arch is an image of a knife or dagger
Enter the chamber and go to the top of the steps in the room
Remove the cover of the chest and get a golden dagger
Come back down the steps and examine the vase on the right
You can rotate it
On the bottom is an impression of a tower and on the side a grid that resembles nothing so much as a star chart
On the other side of the steps is a box in which you will find the Yacht Scroll
You might wish to pick up a couple arrows from the vase next to the box
Go back to the Gallery and on to the next open archway
Hat Chamber Over this arch is an image of a hat a dunce cap with a brim
When you enter this chamber you will be looking at a mannequin of a flute player on the other side of the room
Look to the left where at the foot of a column you will find another vase on which is a star chart and on the bottom of this one is a rectangle with a dome and two rods like antennas
To the right of this vase is some sort of game board get a closeup of this board and click on one of the yellow bars protruding from it
A drawer will slide out and you can acquire the Flax Wick Key
Move around the room looking at the base of the walls
You will find one more star chart vase this one with a cross within a circle on the bottom
Next to it is a vase containing the Throne Scroll
Elsewhere you will find a long straight horn that is the Royal Trumpet
In a pot next to the trumpet is the Flautist Scroll
Perhaps this one is immediately significant considering the presence of the flute playing mannequin
When you are behind the this mannequin note the pipe that runs up his back
Attached to this pipe is a cylinder from which is hanging a plug on a chain
Click on the plug to put it into the cylinder to close an opening in the pipe
On opposite sides of the room are bulging wall panels that show an animal headed figure blowing a trumped that is on a stand like the one in front of the mannequin
You can do that
Put the Royal Trumpet in the stand where it points to one of the panels
Click on the trumpet and when it sounds the panel shatters
Reverse the trumpet
Click on it and the other panel shatters
In one of the new openings are some vases with cobras in them
Best to leave cobras alone
Behind the other shattered panel is what looks to be an athletic punching bag hanging from a pipe like that on the mannequin Aha
On the Flautist Scroll there are eight of these bags depicted so click on the bag eight times forcing air into the pipe
Faintly the sound of a flute is heard
Now go to the room where you saw the cobras to find that they are no longer there so you can go in and get the Hathor Tablet that is on the far wall
This tablet is one of the six on the Translation Scroll
Tabulations to use Gil s terminology when reading the scroll
Go back out to the Gallery and proceed to the right around the corner and on to where there is an archway with a door in it
You can come back to this door later when you have more information
Continue along the Gallery around the corner to an open archway with an arrow above it
Arrow Chamber When you enter this room you should as usual look around
You will find two more star chart vases on the bottom of one a set of three wavy lines and on the other a rectangle with eight lines projecting from one side and a long and short line from the opposite side
Lift the lid of a basket to get the Reed Leaf Key
In this room are six pillars each one with a set of doors tied shut
Go to each pillar and use the Golden Dagger to cut the cords holding the doors together
If you can open the doors after you cut the cord you need not go to any of the other pillars
When the pillar doors open enter it and climb the rope
At the top cross the rope and bone bridge to a room in which there is a firepit and a crossbow mounted on a turntable
The latter is pointed at a bone ladder and two statues at the far side of a pit and it is your task to shoot a fiery arrow at the two statues igniting cords biding their wrists to free them
There is one arrow already lit on the firepot and another one to the side there is also a broken one that is unusable
Save your game here so that if you miss and use up the two arrows you can restore the game and try again
Or perhaps you have a couple arrows from the Knife Chamber in inventory
Put the flaming arrow in the crossbow and aim it by dragging the turntable when you release the mouse button you also release the arrow
Get the other arrow ignite it by passing it over the firepot and shoot again
When you free the wrists on both statues you also free a covering that comes rolling across the pit
Cross to the bone ladder climb it and approach the two almost identical Anubis Tablets
One is deadly and will end your game if you choose it
Check the Translation Scroll to see the one you must not choose
Go back down the bone ladder and cross the pit to the base of the crossbow support pillar where you can pick up the Archway Scroll
Find your way back to the Arrow Chamber and out to the Gallery then proceed to the right to the next open archway over which is an image that could conceivably be that of a boat
Ship Chamber The first thing you see when you enter the Ship Chamber is a model of an Egyptian boat on a display pedestal in the center of the room
It has four columns on each side one of which has fallen
Go around and view the model from the back so that you can readily see the arrangement of the steps note these and the wheel at the rear
The ship may be moved slightly by dragging it with the cursor
Inside a small covered box you can get the Sacred Amulet and the Charmer Scroll which shows a lady holding this very same amulet in front of a cobra
There is a standing chest in the corner of the room from which you may get the Pillar Key
Return to the Gallery and to the last of the open archways
Over this one is the image of a vase
Vase Chamber On the far side of the room as you enter is a table on which is a pot with a bright golden cover move the cover aside and get the Ahnk Key
Looking around you will find three more star chart vases
On the bottom of these are a circle with lines across it a circle with a smaller one centered in it and one with the six toothed comb that you saw in the last room of the King s Chamber
Considering the prominence given to this icon it would be a good idea to make a copy of the star chart on this vase
Since there are no more open archways in the gallery return to the one with the pivoting door
Over this archway is a figure that strangely resembles a parabolic reflector with three energy rays
Astronomy Chambers Click on the door for it to pivot open
When you go through you encounter a series of many stairways leading upward
This really is a long climb
On the way up you will see in the wall on the right a skinny Egyptian star with a handle behind it and a star opening in the wall below it
The handle wants to move if you click on it but it is restrained
Continue upward to the room at the top of the stairs where there are two Horus statues on either side of a grate
Notice that the holes in the grate are star shaped and are on a x grid the same as the star fields on the several star chart vases
To the right is a vase of stars on which are the several icons that were found on the bottoms of the star chart vases
Keep selecting stars from the vase until you get one with a comb icon then put this in the grate where a star should be according to the star chart
Do this for all nine stars on the chart
Having done this correctly the stars fall away the grate recedes to form a stairway and the golden Star Scepter pops out of the wall into the waiting arms of a Horus statue
Get it
It is dark in the room at the top of the newly formed stairs
Return down the entrance stairway to the star in the wall with the handle behind it
Insert the Star Scepter in the star shaped hole then click on the handle which now rotates and the star becomes a sun
Go back up the stairs to find the dark room is now lit
Immediately in front of you as you get to the top of the stairs is a handle in the floor get behind this handle and click on it to move it from right to left to move the stairs and reveal another one
Go down these stairs to get the Astro Scroll
Return to the top and move the lever to its original position
In a corner are two more tablets one of them next to a skeleton with a note in its lap stating that the curse is real
That is a fair enough warning not to take that tablet
Take the other one and you have a Thoth Tablet for your tabulation collection
Following now is an optional operation inasmuch as it does not seem to have any application to finding the sphinx riddle
It might be of interest to amateur astronomers
The walls here are sloping with an opening in all four below which are identical pedestals and above which are the heads of different Egyptian gods
Get the King s Scope from inventory and put it on one of the pedestals
Look through it and you see cloudless blue Egyptian sky
Well it s daytime
You have been moving around the bed in the center of the room now get on it and sleep until night falls as it did in Gil s Sphinx area tent
Get up during the night and you can see different star constellations through each of the windows as you move the scope from pedestal to pedestal
It would be nice if you could note these in some way
Get back on the bed and return to sleep and when you arise in the morning leave this room
Go down the stairs to the Gallery
As you leave the pivoting door you will see an opening ahead at the base of the wall
Go through that
Sobek s Chamber In this room is another boat model much larger than the one in the Ship Chamber and instead of columns on the side there three crocodile god Sobek statues on each side
Getting closeups of these statues reveals that they have different color eyes
Front to back on the left the colors are white green white and on the right pink red blue green
All of the areas behind the King s Chamber have been explored so now return to the Queen s Chamber
Queen s Chamber Go to the niche where the back wall receded and go through the opening in the base of the wall to the right CD When you emerge from the tunnel you will have before you a large stone block in which an illumination fire is burning
Continue to the left of this block and you will pass through a doorway over which there is a circular maze image and you will come to the statue of a pharaoh holding a large lollipop
Take the lollipop turn around and go to the doorway on the right side of which is a fod into which you can insert the lollipop handle pull it down and chains will slowly raise a stone slab almost to the top of the doorway closing you in this small room
Lift the lollipop and the stone goes back down
There doesn t seem to be much point to this room no reason to shut yourself into it
Go back out to the stone with the fire
Proceed along the passage to the right of the burning block past a statue of a seated pharaoh then past two statues of seated pharaohs all the way to the end of the corridor where it is blocked by a very black door again with a circular maze image over it
Turn around and start to go back
On the right is a doorway over which is the maze image and which is blocked by a stone slab held by chains just as when you raised the slab at the lollipop room
This should set you thinking
Return to the lollipop room
Go inside and throw the lollipop switch then quickly step back out through the doorway before the slowly moving slab can go up
Return once more to end of the passageway to find that the slab on the door has now gone down
Enter the room
There you will find a wheel with a snake wrapped around it and attached to a shaft
In inventory it is called a Cobra Wheel
As you turn to leave on a stone above and to the left you will see a drawing
Examination shows it to be a rather simple maze though in fact it is not quite so simple when you have to refer to it later
Leave this room and go back up the passageway to the two seated pharaoh statues who are facing an open doorway
Go through this doorway almost to the end then go right between a pair of large fluted pillars and down some steep steps
Turn left and go along a hallway and into a really immense room
Harp Chamber At the far side of the room a golden snake is coiled around a large pillar
Go up the ramp at the snake s tail then follow the terrace to the right until you come to a building with a conical roof with a scarab on it
Inside is a small golden harp on a pedestal
Click on the harp it will rotate noisily then wait a bit while you hear discordant harp notes
Return to the snake
Walk upward along the snake a long way then up a ladder to a area in which are five harpist mannequins
Get closeups of the bottoms of each of the harps and you will find that on each one a different string tensioning key is missing
You should have gathered five keys while touring the King s Gallery so now proceed to place one in each harp
When you have completed doing this go back down the snake as you move down look around this large room to observe the outstanding graphics
At the bottom go again to the building with the harp on the pedestal
Click again on the harp and once more it rotates noisily after which the notes you hear are no longer discordant
The harp pops off the pedestal and falls to the floor
Pick it up and you will find you have a Gold Harp Key
Return to the two seated pharaoh statues
Rotating Maze Go left down the passageway toward the blocked end
Just before you get to it there is a pink and yellow stone next to the illuminating fire
Though there is nothing to indicate that you should do this click the Cobra Wheel on this stone and the wheel then becomes affixed to the stone
Now click once on the Cobra Wheel to turn it and with much rumbling the very black door swings aside to be replaced by an open passage
This is the entrance to the maze that you saw depicted on the stone near the ceiling of the adjacent room
Examination of the maze diagram will show that the two outer circles are very close together the diagram can not indicate this but the disk formed by inner one of these two represents a turntable and you have just rotated the real one when you rotated the cobra wheel
The entrance that is now before you is at the bottom of the diagram which also shows an exit opposite at the top and another a little to the right of the bottom entrance
The diagram as shown does not represent the rotating maze position that now exists
Right now the turntable has stopped so that you may enter and go around to the right and exit at the top
Do that
Go forward until you are in VR mode at the near end of a long room with many gold columns and a long pit in the center
This VR mode point is sort of a position reference within this room
For a pointless exercise turn left and move toward the wall where the program turns you right and you can go forward to an ornate table
Click on the table top to have the door open to show an arrangement whereby if you drag a knob at the edge of a sun it changes to a star and a block moves to reveal a hand drawn star underneath
That s about it so go back to the entrance VR mode
Go down the length of the other side of the room to where two statues are holding a rather large metal container funnel shaped at the bottom and ending in a lever
Get close and you will see a cuspidor on the floor below
Click on the lever and sand runs into the cuspidor
It s really not a cuspidor but that is what it resembles
Return to the VR mode reference at your entry and go to the central pit
At the bottom of a set of stairs you can see a large yellow figured dome
At the head of the stairs is a pillar that looks like the one from which the Gold Harp Key popped off
Click the Harp Key on the pillar and it becomes affixed and rotates as noisily as before whereupon the dome opens like a flower and four statues holding a palanquin rise from it
There is an empty basket in front of the palanquin
You can sit in the palanquin but again that s about it
Return through the maze to the Cobra Wheel
Click on the Cobra Wheel
It turns and so does the maze turntable which results in its being in the position shown in the ceiling maze diagram
Examining the diagram reveals that it now has nothing but dead ends
You may enter and verify this but that is rather pointless
Click on the Cobra Wheel again to rotate the maze so that you may go through it to the other exit the one just to the right of the entrance which you should now do
This leads through a short passage to an underground room
Before you on a pedestal is a dipper which inventory calls a Sacred Cull
On the floor in a corner in a fetal position is a skeleton from which you can pick up the Flume Scroll
Return through the maze to the Cobra Wheel
Click on the Cobra Wheel to rotate the maze yet again
It has reversed itself from the first position so that you can now again go through to the palanquin room you just go around in the oppositely curving walk as you do it
Go to the sand dispenser put the Sacred Cull on the cuspidor and click on the lever to get a cullful of sand
Take the sand down in the pit and empty it in the basket in front of the palanquin
Do this a tedious five more times
The warp speed function can help here
After the sixth cullful the program places you on the palanquin and you ride down a very deep shaft
When you finally stop move forward through a pivoting door to a cavern in which there is a mosaic cobra
The cobra is coiled around an opening covered by a locked grate
Maze You are at the beginning of another maze
It is diagrammed by the images over the doors in the passageway where you used the Cobra Wheel and on the golden disk found in the Throne Chamber of the King s Gallery but none of these diagrams are in good enough condition to provide the detail needed to guide yourself through
It is not so complicated a maze that you cannot make it through by trial and error
In the maze are several images of several gods to serve as reference points
However here is a detailed set of steps to get you through to the Sacred Pool From the cobra go either left or right until Anubis Jackal God appears through opening in the inner wall Approach Anubis Go right passing Hathor Horned Cow God on the left until Anubis again appears through an opening in the inner wall on the left Approach Anubis Go right
Keep going as the passage jogs and you get turned around
Continue moving forward now curving to the right until Horus Falcon God appears on the right
Turn toward Horus to face him head on Approach Horus Pass Horus on the right and move until you face Anubis head on Approach Anubis
View turns left facing wall Turn right to face Anubis again Click on Anubis
You can now see the Hippopotamus God past Anubis Move forward toward Hippopotamus God and down passage past him to Anubis Click on Anubis then go past him on his right Continue along passage passing Horus on the right The next opening in the wall on the left will be to the Sacred Pool
The opening just beyond on the right is to a six column valve apparatus as is seen on the Flume Scroll Examining the Flume Scroll and this valve apparatus will introduce a new set of six icons appearing at the top of the columns on both
Below each of the columns on the scroll are an associated set of six larger symbols representing ancient cultures real and mythical
Left to right these are Mayan Bermuda Triangle Atlantis Giza Stonehenge and Easter Island
Also on the scroll note the five disks in the red area inside the columns
Now turn your attention to the valve apparatus and perceive what happens when you click and hold the top control on any of the valve apparatus columns
Observe that after a brief pause the dark red area rises from the bottom and gets smaller leaving a pink area behind
A column of five balls is revealed which also rise as long as you hold the control
The reverse occurs when you click and hold the bottom control
Go to the Sacred Pool
Sacred Pool Around the pool are six statues of Anubis
Go to one of them and click on it and it will roll back in its enclosure
Get a closeup of the revealed base where you will see a round cover to the right of which are five small black disks in a background of red and white that you will find varies as you move from statue to statue
The cover shows an icon that is also seen at the top of one of the columns on the Flume Scroll and also on the valve apparatus
You must note the number of small disks in the red area that is associated with each icon
Click on the cover and it will turn and rise
Go to all six Anubis statues and raise the covers and when you have done this to the sixth one you will hear the water draining from the pool
Go to the room where the valve apparatus is located
In each column use the upper and lower controls to move the balls so that they are divided between the white and pink halves as are the black circles at the base of the Anubis statues divided between the red and white sections matching the icon on the Anubis cover with that on the top of the valve columns
Back to the pool
The ladder down to the bottom of the empty pool is between the two animal horns or tusks at the pool edge
Climb down to the bottom go to the center of the pool and look around
Opposite the ladder that you just came down is a shorter one below a fairly large hole in the pool wall and around the wall are six grates with disks above each that show the six by now familiar new icons
Go to these in turn and click on the disks and the grates will open provided you have properly set the disks in the valve apparatus columns
Behind each grate is a very long passage leading to an ornate room in which are unwrapped mummified bodies
VR mode lets you look around these rooms if you wish but what you need to find in each case is a chest flanked by two kneeling gods
Click on the chest cover and it moves aside so that you can get a shiny golden object that looks like a torch but inventory calls it a key after which you can leave the room
When you leave each of the six rooms as you get between the railings at the head of the entry stairs find the warp speed cursor that will take you directly to the pool
When you have gathered six keys those forEaster Island Bermuda Giza Stonehenge Atlantis andMayan Pyramid you have completed your mission for this area and it is time to head back
To avoid the maze go to the hole halfway up the wall of the pool enter it and follow the tunnel to a ladder at the top of which is a grate locked in place by a pin
Click on the pin to open the grate and climb out next to the mosaic cobra
Go back to the palanquin and click on the rod supporting the basket
The basket empties and the program again puts you in the palanquin for the long ride up to the room at the top
Leave the palanquin and go through the rotating maze past the Cobra Wheel past the two seated pharaohs to the single seated pharaoh
Click on this statue and it slides aside to reveal an entrance to a sand covered passageway that in turn takes you to a ladder in a vertical passageway
Go down the ladder and you will enter a large chamber in which is a pharaoh s funerary ship the model of which and its surroundings you saw in the King s Gallery Ship Chamber
Funerary Boat Chamber Go down the stairs to the floor of the chamber where you will be at the stern of the ship
Go along either side of the boat toward the front
There is an alcove between the two ropes running along the floor
Enter this alcove where there is a vase in a corner
Knock it over and when it breaks you can get the Vase Bolt
While in the alcove look at the figure of Sobek the crocodile god in the stone arch and observe that several of the arch stones are depressed Compare this figure with the Archway Scroll and note the numbers of the depressed stones
When you come back out of the alcove go back along the side of the ship to your right to the stairs you came down
Crocodile Cavern In the far corner under the stairs you will see some cobwebs
Go through the cobwebs and you will find a stone arch in which is a statue of the crocodile god
Again referring to the Archway Scroll click in numerical sequence on the stones that you have noted as having been depressed in the alcove arch
The statue will rotate and you must quickly hop onto the turning base to get through
Proceed along this rough cave until you come to a stream with three crocodiles swimming back and forth in it
To get across step on one of them the middle one is fastest and keep going until you get to a bone pile in which there are a pair of tablets
Consult the Translation Scroll to determine which of the two is deadly then choose the other and you will have a Sobek Tablet for your tabulation collection
Return to the Funerary Ship Chamber
Funerary Boat Chamber You will have noted that each of the pillars on the sides of the rooms have rungs on them
When you climb these pillars you will see Sobek heads with colored eyes and by dragging the levers you can rotate the tops of the pillars to change eye colors
Sobek s Chamber in the King s Gallery in which there was a ship model had Sobek statues with different eye colors so your assignment is to set these on the columns in the same pattern
Sobek s Chamber had three statues on a side here there are four columns on a side
Refer to the Yacht Scroll and you will see that six of the eight columns have Sobek silhouettes on them these are the ones to use in setting the eye colors
When you have this task done go up the steps at the bow end of the chamber to the wheel at the top and get a closeup of the hub on the right
There is a hole where you can insert the Vase Bolt to lock the wheel hub to the axle
Then click on the wheel twice if you need to to draw the ship toward you just as happens with the Ship Chamber model
Now when you go to the stern of the ship you will see that a hole in the floor has been uncovered
Down you go
Watery Passages At the bottom of the steps is another rough cavern that leads to a pool
Once more down you go
When you dive into the pool go down two strokes then go right to an underwater opening and keep going until you surface where you find that there are only two openings in the cavern wall that surrounds you
The one to the left leads to a dead end so take the one to the right
Move along this cavern about clicks until you change to VR mode
You now have ahead of you three choices to proceed
Save your game here should you wish to make a new start
The cavern on the left leads to the Cobra Shrine the one in the center leads to the Temple of Ra and the one on the right is the River of Death
The latter leads to items and information you will need so go that way
River of Death After a lengthy swim or watery walk you will come to a bank that you cannot climb but if you move the cursor to the left where it becomes the bent finger reverse and then click there appears a bank that you can get up and which leads to a triangular shaped cave
Enter take a deep breath and hold it for you must swim under water for several clicks until you come to a ladder and can climb out
VR mode lets you look around
You are in a cave with a hole in the roof and a wall with several hand and footholds
A short distance away is a briefcase go to it
Next to it is a pickax for you to pick up
Inside the briefcase is a journal kept by another if Gil s colleagues
Read it for it is very informative
Gil was correct when he told you on his introductory tape that he thought he was overheard
This fellow evidently went through the King s Gallery where he found and left the Sacred Amulet and the Charmer Scroll since he describes them and indicates how to use the amulet
Another thing he writes of wading these rivers rather than swimming
And now you have yet another name for the tablets Tabulator
Look around and you will find his remains and the tablet with which he was working according to his journal it is quite obvious that you should find the other one about which he has written
The cursor leads you to the wall with the handholds climb it and get Horus Tablet
Climb back down and return through the underwater cave and the River of Death to where the three river caverns join
Cobra Shrine Traverse the leftmost of the three river caverns until your way is blocked by a white wall covered by hieroglyphics and with a hole in the center
This clearly must be what Gil s now dead colleague wrote about and the hole he made
Use the pickax twice on the hole and much of the wall falls away
A cobra rises ready to attack
Quickly go to inventory get the Sacred Amulet and click it on the cobra which then sinks away
Enter the shrine and go up to the large cobra statue then turn and face outward
Very carefully search in the shadows to the left of the railing and you will find another pair of tablets the cursor does not change
Refer once more to the Translation Scroll to determine which of the two not to choose
Inventory does not identify this tablet but from the notes of Gil s late colleague that you just read it must be the Meretsinger Tablet
You now have the six tableture clues about which Gil spoke when reading the Translation Scroll
Return to where the three river caverns join
The Temple of Ra Proceed through the center of the three river caverns and after much wading the temple appears on the other side of an entrance pool
You have to go through this pool right up to where you are stopped by a wall then go either left or right up a ramp to VR mode
Double back so that you can go through the big arch where in the distance across a lake you can see four very large seated statues carved from a lakeshore cliff
These statues bear a curious resemblance to the four statues of Ramses II by the Nile at Abu Simbel even to the fallen head from one of them
In order to get to them clearly you will have to go around the lake so turn left and start walking
After a while you will come to a stone arch behind which is a walkway leading to another arch and eventually to a very yellow pyramid
Moving the cursor over the window in the door of this building brings up several different icons and if you click on them they become fixed
You can walk around this pyramid and on three sides there are toeholds so that you can climb to the top
If you do this you can see large raised rotatable disks covered with hieroglyphics and above them are cobras on different colored spheres
However there is no way to get past this pyramid and continue along the lake shore to the statues
Going left from the temple was the wrong choice so head back
After you leave the steps down from the yellow pyramid examine the bases of the trees as you go back because in the sand at one of them you will find a sphere that the inventory calls a Scarab Weight
When you get back to the Temple of Ra continue straight ahead to go around the lake in the other direction
After about a dozen clicks you will have passed several groups of trees and will be in VR mode next to a small temple arch in the water to your left
Cross the stones to reach this structure and go up to the top where you will find three umbrella shaped orange objects on a stone scarab
Click on each of them and the shuttered tops fold aside to show flattened hemispheres of different colors
Note these colors
Return back down from the arch and continue your walk around the lake
As you pass in the shadow of the pointed rock ahead watch for and pick up another Scarab Weight in the sand on the right
Cliff Statues Eventually you will reach the statues where there will be a ramp leading up to them from the shore
Go past this ramp to other side of the fallen statue head then turn back and go to the head s ear from which you can pluck another Scarab Weight
Return to the ramp that you passed and go up it into the alcove where you will find Ra s Scroll in the sand
Scrutinize this scroll Come back out of the alcove and go left on the terrace until you come to some steps on the left leading upward between the legs of one of the statues
Go up the steps and keep ascending using steps and handholds until you get to the top of the statue looking out across the lake to the Temple of Ra
Look down to see three circles with icons in them
Copy the icons
If you studied Ra s Scroll you will recognize them on it though they are reversed and appear as mirror images
Go back down to the lakeshore and then back around the lake to the temple
The Temple of Ra Go through the arch to VR mode at the entrance pool then go all the way along the right side of the pool
Turn right to see a statue with colored geometric markings on its torso and left leg
As usual make a note of these markings Note There are three symbols on the statue s leg
You can t see the lowest one when close to the statue but you can see it when you are one click back from it Also one of the colors of the torso markings may appear to be orange but it is in fact meant to be red
This true for the other statues that you will encounter Go back around the pool and all the way down the left side of it the program turns you left to see an entrance in the wall
Go through this entrance then just keep clicking as the program takes you along passageways up steps out to and across a temple escarpment into a tower through more passageways up more steps into a long narrow room with a pair of windows on each side
Turn around to see most of another statue with colored symbols on its torso and leg for you to note
Turn around and go down the steps at the far end of the room
This brings you out into an open area and into VR mode
Go left and look down where you can see the entrance pool
Turn around and you will see suspended by chains a disk like those on the sides of the yellow pyramid
Continue on through the doorway and up the steps into another long narrow room and that has at the far end one more statue with torso and leg markings to note
Proceed down the steps under the statue and you will come upon what might best be called a Blue Balance
There are three rods on this device each with a Scarab Weight on one end you must add the Scarab Weights that you have collected to the other ends in order to balance the rods
Now recall the geometric markings that you have seen on the three statues set the top ball of the balance so that the geometric and color code coincides with that statue in which the black circle on the leg is on top
Then taking into account the position of the black leg circles do the same operation for the other two balls on the balance and if done correctly the chains in back will move with much rumbling
Return to the open area where you could see the entrance pool
Looking closely at it now you will see four icon patterns that you should note and perhaps recognize from your earlier visit to the yellow pyramid
That is where you should now go Yellow Pyramid Go up to the door of the pyramid and set the icon patterns on the window to match the ones on the entrance pool
When you do this the door will fall inward
Go inside and look around
It appears that that is all you can do so go back outside and consider the only other adjustment possibility that you have previously found that you could make the three disks on the pyramid sides Now you have a matching exercise to do
Recall the colors left to right of the shuttered hemispheres on top of the scarab arch at the end of the lake
Recall also left to right the icons in the circles on the top of the giant statue
Look at Ra s Scroll and locate these icons even though they are reversed in the two columns on the left then pick out the corresponding glyphs in the two columns on the right
You can now associate a glyph with a color
The cobras that are on three sides of the pyramid near the top are resting on spheres of the three different colors
The glyphs are on the moveable disks below the cobras so rotate the disks to match the glyph with the color
There is however a rather subtle catch to this operation
As has been remarked the icons on Ra s scroll are reversed from those in the statue circles and therefore you need to set under the cobra the glyph on the disk that is opposite your chosen one
This is not very difficult to figure out and as you climb back down you can see the bottom edge of the disk and you can tell if you did it right
When you have set the three correctly you will hear a couple of sharp cracks
Reenter the pyramid
The formerly smooth slanting areas on each side of the three pharaoh statues now have tablet shaped depressions in them
Proceed to put the six tablets that you have collected into the depressions when the god glyph on the chosen tablet matches the one on the column above a scroll pops out of the hole in the hemisphere and you will soon have theGiza Complex Bermuda Stonehenge Easter Island Mayan Pyramid andAtlantianScrolls each with an Atlantean script icon matching those on the hexagon in the Sacred Scroll and therefore you can associate the six keys that you got from the crypts around the Sacred Pool with each of the red circles on the Sacred Scroll hexagon
You are finished with your mission at the Temple of Ra
Find your way back through the waterways to the Funerary Boat Chamber and to the Queen s Chamber
The warp arrow should help
CD Go to the Great Pyramid entrance where the generator has been running all this time on a gallon of gasoline turn it off if you wish and get in the helicopter
Fly to the sphinx site and go to the tunnel entrance in the side of the sphinx body
Enter and approach the blue hexagonal portal
Referring now to the Sacred Scroll and the identified red circles put the keys in the yellow receptacles by the circles
With all six keys in their proper places the portal rolls aside and you can see a golden winged box but as you move toward it a star viewer drops down in front of you
Save your game here
There are six lenses in this unit and placing the cursor not clicking on each results in a different star field appearing
You must select from these the one that matches one of the two you found in Gil s desk at the beginning of the game then click on that lens
If you have read the accompanying articles on the pyramid builders you will have noted their strong interest in the Orion constellation
Choosing a wrong lens brings the familiar death s head choosing the correct one allows you to move to the box which turns out to be the Ark of the Covenant and brings up the culmination of the game
It is hoped that you will be able to understand what is said in the long concluding lecture
Notes There are some things that you encounter in this game that simply must be accepted though one wonders about them
A universal one that is standard with almost all Adventure games is the inventory where do you keep these items and how do you carry them with you
After a number of games one does not think about this oddity any more
A few others The Pyramids and Sphinx have been one of the world s most popular tourists sites for ages yet you see none of these nor any evidence that there have been any the entire Giza plateau is deserted When you get past the King s and Queen s chambers in the pyramid there is nothing to gain in the speculation of what might be the source of the fuel and oxygen for the myriad torches and other illuminating fires that continuously burn to supply illumination and presumably have done so thoughout the ages The pharaohs must have had some advanced technology lost over the ages that produced the scope used to observe the stars as well as the mechanisms for the many massive movements encountered You walk across a lot of sand why are there no footprints Timeline CHRONOLOGY The chronology listed here is that shown in the game introduction

Internet InformationThere are a plethora of articles on the sphinx and the pyramids on the Internet
Excerpts from a few of these have been selected as being of interest to a person playing Riddle of the Sphinx The Sphinx is the first large royal statue known in ancient Egypt and is one of the world's most significant monuments
A colossal feet long and feet high it lies in the old kingdom quarry carved from a core of solid bedrock and completed with masonry
It represents a couchant lion with the head of a king wearing a false beard and the traditionalNemeshead dress
The image represented by the Sphinx is generally accepted as Chephren son of King Cheops builder of the Great Pyramids at Giza
Most scholars believe that it dates back to about BC the time of the Fourth Dynasty
The giant statue represents Chephren as Horus presenting offerings to Ra the sun god in the temple courtyard of the Sphinx
Although in common usage Sphinxis a Greek word and was not originally used as a name for the statue
In the New Kingdom around BC it was known asHor em akht 'Horus in the Horizon' orBw Hol 'Place of Horus'
There can be no doubt that the Sphinx once had a beard
Pieces of it were found between the Sphinx's paws by the archaeologist Caviglia in but these fragments represented only about of the original beard
Graphic reconstructions were attempted but the work proved difficult with so little of the beard available as a basis
Egyptologists also had difficulty in dating the beard to the Old or New Kingdom and attempts at restoration were abandoned particularly as the beardless Sphinx was already famous worldwide
Caviglia therefore donated some of the fragments to the Cairo Museum others can now be seen in the British Museum in London
Enigmas and stories connected with the Sphinx are numerous
One such apocryphal tale has it that a record of the lost city of Atlantis lies somewhere under the Sphinx's paws while others believe in the story of a huge temple beneath the Sphinx itself
Both of these are sadly untrue
During the past two centuries many have come to study and excavate the monument
These include French scholars accompanying Napoleon's army in Caviglia in H Vyse in Mariette in Kamal and Daressy in and Baraize in
It was Baraize who first began restoration work by renovating the head using cement and clearing the sand completely around the Sphinx
The most recent period of restoration began in continuing until the present day
The cement which had been used in earlier attempts at restoration was now found to be causing problems
The statue is mostly constructed of porous limestone which allows the passage of air
Because cement is non porous and rigid changes in the basic proportions of the statue were found to be occurring
Another problem is caused by the rising water table which evaporates leaving salts behind
These salts react with the limestone causing it to become powdery and to crumble
Pollution from the nearby city of Cairo together with heat wind sand and humidity are all agents in the monument's slow process of disintegration
The true origin and purpose of the Sphinx remains a mystery and it is perhaps a puzzle which will never be fully solved
Despite its fundamental enigma the image of the Sphinx remains in the mind of history as the keystone of ancient Egyptian civilization and a part of its religious beliefs
Thus the smile on the face of the Sphinx is eternal
Information on the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx by Graham Hancock The Door in the Great Pyramid In March a small door made of marble or limestone with two copper handles fixed on it was discovered by a mechanized robot Upuaut II The opener of the way in ancient Egyptian at the end of a long narrow shaft x inches and feet long
Since then the discoverer robotics engineer Rudolf Gantenbrink from Munich has been banned from resuming the exploration and opening the door
The official reason given by the Egyptian Antiquities Authorities known as the Supreme Council of Antiquities SCA was that Gantenbrink leaked the news of the discovery to the British Press in April and thus apparently broke a rule of archaeology
The Director of the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo Dr Rainer Stadelmann sided with the Egyptians and condemned Gantenbrink for his press action
Dr Stadelmann was adamant about the non importance of the find
This is not a door there is nothing behind it
The President of the Supreme Council for Antiquities Dr Muhamad Bakr went as far as claiming a hoax
The orifice of the shaft is too small for the robot to go through and he accused the German scientist of not having the correct approvals from the SCA to carry out the exploration
Dr Bakr fired the Chief Inspector of the Giza Pyramid Plateau Dr Zahi Hawass although the official reason given was that a valuable ancient statue under the custody of Hawass was stolen from Giza
Three months later in June Dr Bakr himself was fired and replaced by Dr Nur El Din
Amid accusations of malpractice and fraud Dr Bakr spoke of a mafia which had been involved with the Pyramids for the last twenty years
Refusing to give names Dr Bakr said I wanted the whole matter investigated by the prosecution authorities but my request was refused
Tunnels and Chambers Under the Great Sphinx I
In a series of expeditions between and led by John Anthony West an independent Egyptologist scientific investigators conducted geological and seismic surveys around the Great Sphinx of Egypt
The chief geologist was Dr Robert Schoch Professor of Geology at Boston University and the chief seismologist was Thomas Dobecki from the highly respected Houston consulting firm McBride Ratclif amp Associates II
The team's conclusions were as follows A Geology The pattern of erosion on the Sphinx indicates that it was carved at the end of the last Ice Age when heavy rains fell on the eastern Sahara perhaps more than years ago
This contrasts starkly with the orthodox Egyptological dating for the Sphinx of around years ago
B Seismography
The seismic survey indicated the existence of several unexplored tunnels and cavities in the bedrock beneath the Sphinx including a large rectangular chamber at a depth of some feet beneath the monuments front paws

In John West and his team were physically expelled from the site by Dr Zahi Hawass then and now the Egyptian government's Chief Inspector of Antiquities for the Pyramids and Sphinx
He appeared to be angered by the suggestion that the Sphinx might be far older than the civilization of Egypt itself and thus the work of a lost civilization and was particularly incensed by an NBC television film that was made about the team's work
This film linked the Sphinx to Atlantis and suggested that the chamber beneath the paws might contain the legendary Hall of Records of Atlantis
Hawass called these claims Amer ican hallucinations
There is no scientific basis for any of this
We have older monuments in the same area
They definitely weren't built by men from Atlantis
It's nonsense and we won't allow our monuments to be exploited for personal enrichment
The Sphinx is the soul of Egypt
IV
An article in the Egyptian press responding to the NBC film quoted Dr Hawass on his further reasons for expelling John West and his team from the Sphinx enclosure I have found that their work is carried out by installing endoscopes in the Sphinx body and shooting film for all phases of the work in a propagandistic but not scientific manner
I therefore suspended the work of this unscientific mission and made a report which was presented to the permanent commission who rejected the mission's work in the future
V The NBC film was produced by a certain Boris Said and partially financed by investments from the members of the Association for Research and Enlightenment
The ARE headquartered in Virginia Beach in the USA is a multimillion dollar organization that exists to promulgate the teachings and prophecies of an American psychic Edgar Cayce who died in
Prominent amongst Cayce's pronouncements were many statements to the effect that the Sphinx had been built in BCE by the survivors of the lost civilization of Atlantis and that the survivors had concealed beneath it a Hall of Records containing all the wisdom of their lost civilization and the true history of the human race
Cayce prophesied that this Hall of Records would be rediscovered and opened between and
He connected the opening to second coming of Christ
VI
In John West and Professor Robert Schoch of Boston University put in an application to the Egyptian authorities to resume their research
Their application was ignored
VII
In April the Egyptian authorities granted a one year license to a new team to conduct surveys around the Sphinx
This team which claims academic sponsorship from Florida State University is largely financed through the Schor Foundation of New York by Dr Joseph Schor an American multimillionaire
Dr Schor is a life member of the ARE and wrote on th May of his great personal interest in corroborating the Cayce records which indicated that the culture which led to the building of the Pyramids dates to BCE
He also stated his wish to further delineate that civilization
VIII
On April th Dr Schor stated of his current project at the Sphinx We do not work for the Edgar Cayce Group
The major purpose of the Schor Foundation and Florida State University is to aid in the preservation and restoration of the Pyramids and Sphinx
In addition we are surveying the underground of the Giza Plateau to find faults and chasms that might collapse
This will increase the safety of the plateau
IX
Also financed by Dr Schor is a short video film shot at the end of by Boris Said and produced in early
The film opens with Dr Zahi Hawass scrambling into a tunnel leading under the Sphinx
When he reaches the bottom he turns to face the camera and whispers to the viewer Even Indiana Jones would never dream to be here
Can you believe it
We are now inside the Sphinx in this tunnel
This tunnel has never been opened before
No one really knows what's inside this tunnel
But we are going to open it for the first time
In commentary the film's narrator goes on to state Edgar Cayce America's famousSleeping Prophet predicted that a chamber would be discovered beneath the Sphinx a chamber containing the recorded history of human civilization
For the first time we'll show you what lies beneath this great statue a chamber which will be opened tonight live for our television cameras
X Dr Schor has stated that this video is not a promotional venture aimed at hooking a major US network to televise a live opening of a chamber under the Sphinx
He insists It was made to test script and equipment and was made in November which was many months before we received approval for our expedition
We have abandoned its use
XI
On April Dr Zahi Hawass announced in the Egyptian press that there were secret tunnels under the Sphinx and around the Pyramids and stated his belief that these tunnels would prove to carry many secrets of the building of the Pyramids
The Sphinx The Sphinx unlike the Pyramids is carved out of the living rock
It is feet meters long and in parts is feet meters high
It faces due east towards the equinox
It has been suggested that it was built around the same time as the construction of the Pyramid of Khafre Chephren c B C E
the pyramid to the left of the sphinx but recent findings by John Anthony West suggest that there are water erosions unlike any other marks found on other Giza monuments
Unlike sand and wind erosions which produce horizontal marks West found that the erosion marks on the Sphinx were vertical like those associated by water but unlike the sand and wind marks which can be explained thanks to the destructive forces of the Sahara where did the water marks originate
Well we know that Egyptologist's believed that the Sphinx was built in BC in the time of the pharaoh Chephren or Khafre so why are therenoinscriptions that identify Khafre with the Sphinx
Surely a great monument having to be painstakingly carved out of solid rock would have been celebrated but there is not even the slightest of mention regarding it's construction
Dr Robert Schoch a geologist and professor from Boston University decided he would examine the new findings and come up with his own answers
He agreed with West's conclusion regarding the water erosion but remarked that if it were due to the torrential rains pouring down on Egypt's monuments at that time why are there no other water erosions found in Egypt to validate his theory
Surely there wasn't just a cloud raining down on the Sphinx
Again Egyptologist's dismissed Schoch's theory saying that the great rain storms that once happened over Egypt had stopped long before the Sphinx was built
Then in stepped Robert Buvaul with his own theory behind the Sphinx's true age I will let him in his own words explain his theory In I published a paper in the Oxford Journal Discussions In Egyptology vol
in which I demonstrated that the three Great Pyramids and their relative position to the Nile created on the ground a sort of D 'hologram' of the three stars of Orion's belt and their relative position to the Milky Way
To support this contention I brought into evidence the inclined shafts in the Great Pyramid which were aimed at the south meridian towards these group of stars as well as written evidence from the Pyramid Texts that identified the afterlife destiny of the pyramid kings with Orion
Later in my book The Orion Mystery Heinemann Mandarin I also demonstrated that the best fit for the Giza Pyramids Nile pattern with the Orion's belt Milky Way pattern occurred when the sky was pushed back in time i e
precessed to the epoch of BC
There were good reasons for doing so
The ancient Egyptians for example constantly refer to a remote golden age they called Zep Tepi The First Time of Osiris which they believed had long predated the Pyramid Age
Osiris was Orion and the Great Pyramid had a shaft directed to Orion at the meridian
To me this silent astro architectural language seemed to be spelling out here is Osiris in the sky when these pyramids were built yet know too that his origins are rooted in the First Time
But The First Time of what
How could the stars of Orion have a First Time
Well they can
And they do
Provided of course that you can read through the allegorical language of the ancients via the symbolic architecture and the related Pyramid Texts
Allegory to put it in another way is the Q Basics of the master astronomers who designed the Giza complex
When the stars of Orion are observed at the meridian in the precise manner that the ancient Egyptian astronomers did over many centuries they could not help noting that these stars crossed the south meridian at different altitudes at different epochs
This is of course due to the phenomenon of Precession see The Orion Mystery appendices and
In short the stars of Orion can be said to have a starting point or beginning at the nadir of their precessional cycle
Simple calculations show that this occurred in BC
Could the ancient astronomers of the Pyramid Age have used their very clever silent language combined with Precession to freeze the First Time of Osiris somewhat like the gifted architects of a gothic cathedral froze in its allegorical stonework the time of Christ
In the summer of Graham Hancock and I got together to investigate this issue further
Graham was quick to realize the important implications this approach could have on the Sphinx problem
He had a hunch that the curious harking back to the epoch of BC by the pyramid builders of Giza was an invitation by them to consider the actual age of the Sphinx
If this hypothesis was correct then the Sphinx must be an original time marker of that remote epoch using an obvious celestial tag valid for BC
But which tag
What could the Sphinx be representing that was in the sky
Could this have something to do with the due east direction of its gaze towards the horizon
In his ground breaking book Fingerprints of the Gods Heinemann Mandarin Hancock pointed out that the First Time date of BC also denoted the beginning or First Time of the Age of Leo
This was when the lion constellation would have risen heliacally at dawn before the sun on the day of the spring vernal equinox
This event brought the celestial lion to rest due east thus in perfect alignment with the Sphinx
The Sphinx in other words was made to look at his own image in the horizon and consequently at his own time
Hancock pointed out that BC was no random date
It very precisely denoted another beginning that of Orion Osiris defined on the ground with the pattern and alignments of the nearby Pyramids
Here then were not just the Pyramids but also the Sphinx luring us to the same date of BC
But were we dealing with a coincidence albeit an astonishing one or was all this part of a deliberate long term scheme set by the ancients
Could it be possible that some blueprint was put into motion in BC with the making of the Sphinx then to be completed much later by the builders of the Pyramids
Was there evidence of a continuous presence here at Giza through the ages of some master 'astronomers' who could have been responsible to see this scheme through
If so who were they
Where had they come from
Why here at Giza
Graham and I have spent the last two years researching this fascinating issue
We believe that what we have uncovered will change the perceptions of what Giza was and still is forever
The full results of our investigation as you might have guessed are laid out in our new book Keeper of Genesis available now at a discount through AA amp ES
Suffice at this stage to say that author Colin Wilson who gave the book an early review thinks it's a much more satisfying tour de force than Fingerprints of the Gods or The Orion Mystery
So has Robert Buvaul got a good case
Many people seem to validate his theory but maybe we will never truly understand the reasons behind these great monuments
We can only listen to the theories behind the mystery and come to our own conclusions
Until we are given unquestionable proof there will always be people wanting to knock others idea's but please keep an open mind to all possibilities and try to enjoy the experience
SPHINX RESTORATION FINALE President Mubarak unveiled the renovated Sphinx whose million U S makeover took years to finish
The greatest challenge facing the Sphinx's modern day restorers was undoing the damage caused by previous restorations
Buried in sand and protected from the elements since the Middle Ages the Sphinx was fully uncovered in the s only to be patched with cement which leached salt through the structure weakening it
After stones fell off a hind paw in the s more cement and stones were added broadening the body by as much as nine feet in some places and ruining the lion's contour
Current efforts began after a boulder fell off the deteriorating Sphinx's right shoulder in
Workmen used photographs from the s and a color coded stone by stone blueprint of the Sphinx
Each damaged stone removed was measured weighed and sketched
Each new stone was hand cut and placed with a mortar of lime and sand
Stones as heavy as pounds were installed
The project did not restore the Sphinx's beard parts of which are in the British and Egyptian museums
Nor will he again have a nose which has been missing since the th century
May compiled from a variety of news articles
NEW ROBOT TO EXPLORE GANTENBRINK'S DOOR Zahi Hawass was quoted as saying that it is likely that the Great Pyramid still does have an undiscovered chamber referring to the door discovered by Rudolf Gantenbrink in March with the Upuaut robot
Dr Hawass said a new robot is being readied to continue the job started a few years ago by Gantenbrink

Ring Twilight of The Gods Short Review Following the success of Ring The Legend of The Niebelungen in Arxel Tribe releases Ring Twilight of The Gods
The game changes from st person perspective adventure game into a rd person perspective adventure game
The game still maintain the pure adventure style from the first game
I do not experience any unnecessary fighting or jumping not excessively like Tomb Raider kind of game
In fact there is no fighting sequence anywhere in the game
The graphics are one of the best in the past years
In fact Ring II has better graphics than Microid's Syberia
All images within this walkthrough are examples of what kind of images you could expect inside the game
The sound and voice acting are superbly done just like its predecessor
I give both graphics and sounds quality an A
The puzzles are range from easy to very difficult especially on chapter where you need to pay attention to your surrounding yup it's the infamous Pixel Hunting kind of puzzle and inside the dragon lair where you have to use your skill to navigate the character in a timely sequence action
These two are the toughest puzzles inside the game
The control is a mix between keyboard and mouse control
You will have to use the mouse on the close up view of an item or location
As for movement you will use your keyboard to navigate the main character
The downside of the game is its inventory system
You could only hold item in your inventory
This could be very tedious in some of the puzzles that requires multiple items to solve it
I'm not sure what kind of thought inside the designer to design this kind of inventory system
If you are looking for a good solid adventure game with great story and do not bothered with keyboard navigational system and the inventory system that could only hold item this is a perfect new year's treat for you
Introduction The game is created based on the story of Siegfried
Experience his adventure as he slays dragon giants wins the love of Brunhilde the Valkyrie and his ultimate death in the Twilight of the Gods
He accepts the challenge of the Gods to prove that he is a worth successor of the Walsungs the hero clan in Scandinavian folk lore
K E Y M A P P I N G Chapter Two Pay attention to the glittering objects on the ground
These are the objects that he could get
Too bad our character could only pick up one object at a time

Ring II A Step by Step Guide of Three Challenges by BeckyChapter The Revelation of Origins The Giant Spider Stinging Trees Challenge Mime leaves you in an outdoor area where you see several odd looking weeping willowesque trees Walk over to the body of the dead spider Pick up the stick Use the stick to pick up the acid pouch Walk over to the tree whose branches are NOT waving Use the stick and pouch on the silent tree You will fall back When you wake up push the tree over and crawl through the hollow trunk You will emerge out the other side If you wish save your game Turn around so that you are squarely facing the tree you just crawled through Walk backwards very slowly This will trigger a view showing a spider coming toward you Walk straight forward to the fallen tree Hit ldquo Enter rdquo to crawl back through it The spider will die You are now free to crawl forward through the tree and to proceed on your way Chapter The Dragon Fafner and the Rhinegold The Spiky Wall Challenge You enter a cave with tiles on the floor At the back of the cave is a wall of spikes Some tiles are solid gray ndash these drop you to your death Other tiles contain a reddish serpentine pattern These are safe to walk on Two tiles are missing ndash those you must jump over Walk over the safe tiles You will probably die a few times before reaching the spiky wall When you have successfully completed the second jump pause and look at the tiles leading up to the wall The very last tile hereinafter the Trigger Tile next to the spiky wall triggers the wall rsquo s forward motion When you get to the tile BEFORE the Trigger Tile turn around Save your game Step backwards onto the Trigger Tile to start the wall then walk on the next two tiles and jump across to where the path rewinds Turn Jump across the missing tile Walk to the side wall turn and walk up the path until the path turns again At this point if you have been quick and efficient you might want to consider quickly hitting F and saving your game Then click on ldquo Continue rdquo and the game will resume from that point The wall is still grinding toward you and you have some more walking to do and one more missing tile to jump over As you do this the camera angles shift which make the task harder than it should be If you do save the game when you reload the wall starts grinding toward you for about a second before you regain keyboard control Still if you have been efficient up to that point in walking and jumping working from the saved game will mean that you haven rsquo t lost your good work on the first most difficult part of this challenge Once you have finished walking on the path walk to the room entrance and go completely through the opening The wall will eventually stop moving Save your game Now you must walk the tiled path one more time to reach the confrontation with Fafner Chapter The Valkyrie The Crusher Fireball ChallengeYou enter an underground cavern You can see two crusher walls moving toward the center of the cavern where there are several metal posts with spinning knives Walk carefully over to the moving crusher wall on the right until the camera angle shifts Then move back toward the middle and position yourself a short distance away from the spinning knives ndash just far enough away so that they can rsquo t reach you Make sure you are facing so that you can run straight ahead and not run into the knives Wait until the right wall starts to move backward Run forward as the wall recedes on your right and the knives spin on your left Run until you are approximately parallel to the furthest spinning knife post Stop I have been able to do this by walking not running if I have first positioned Siegfried correctly It takes seven steps At about this point the camera angle will shift If you wish save your game The next challenge is the fireballs At this point you can still walk sideways into the spinning knives if you aren rsquo t careful Walk as close to the fireballs as you can without dying Watch the fireballs The closest left lower hole in the wall has fireballs that shoot out in patterns of two Wait until the second fireball has just been shot out of the hole Run straight forward until you are right at the edge of the pit I have been able to do this by walking not running if the timing is absolutely correct
Stop If you wish save your game Turn carefully and walk toward the bridge that moves back and forth over the pit Position yourself squarely in front of the bridge Wait until the bridge starts out in front of you Step onto it As it moves step forward until you rsquo re near the front edge When the bridge has almost reached the other side jump onto the floor on the other side of the pit If you miss the jump and remain on the bridge that is if you haven rsquo t already fallen into the pit start walking backwards and you can back right off the bridge onto the original floor and then try again

RIPPERWALKTHROUGH This is pretty much a step by step walkthrough of the game
However partof the fun of this game is figuring out where to go or who to talk to nextas you gather more clues and information
You may enjoy Ripper more if yourefer to this only when you're really stuck or need a hint for a puzzle Although this walkthrough is arranged in a fairly logical order your gamemay not follow this order exactly depending on who you've talked to orwhere you've been
This will tell you everything you need to look at or take in each act every place to go and who to talk to and will give hints for all puzzles
For the puzzles I've tried to give just a general hint first under eachmain heading
For progressively more complete answers read down theindented list under each heading
But be aware that reading these hintlists will gradually give away the answers to the puzzles Try covering them and only reading as far as you need
Often certain events conversations or puzzles need to be completedbefore other possibilities will open up
If you're really stuck thereis someone you haven't talked to something you haven't seen or a leadyou haven't followed through

HOW DO I WIN THE CHESS GAME This game has special rules You'll need to figure them out
It may take a while It may take quite a while Here are some hints The object of the game is for you to get the computer's king before it gets yours This is NOT a chess game Your two knights in gold are unusable until all of your pawns cute little guys are gone It is virtually impossible to win without using your knights Do the best you can with your pawns but basically get rid of them When pawns attack or reach the opposite side of the board they become fat men
They still behave as pawns except they now can attack computer's knights Having them on the board however still makes your knights useless
Pawns move square any direction
Pawns can not attack computer's knights
But they can attack computer's pawns and dragons Knights move or squares any direction including diagonally Kings move square not diagonally
Can not go past grated row
The computer's pieces do not follow the same rules that yours do The computer's knights are active from the beginning of the game The computer's strategy seems to be to go directly for your knights and king so watch out When the computer's knights transform to big mean looking guys they can bump each other off of a square in order to occupy it
In short ha Try to keep both of your knights and get rid of all your pawns so that your knights are useable Use your knights to get the computer's king Watch out for your king For your first move move your king one square left This essentially forces the computer to move first
NOTE This is only a summary of the chess game that will enable you to win it

Solution by Mike Marcelais Version November Thanks to Andrew Becker for helping with the image maps Julie Pickhardt for help with the HTML and Erik Gos Tom Mueller and Ron Opperman for extra tips and corrections IntroductionMaps of the RealmsRivenTay rd AgeSolutionGenerator IslandForest IslandExperiment IslandGenerator IslandExperiment IslandMap IslandForest IslandTayGenerator IslandAge Catherine s IslandGenerator IslandIntroductionRiven like Myst is a very open game
The puzzles to be solved are scattered around the world and are often integrated very naturally into the environment
Often there is a lot of area that you can explore with access to lots of devices that seem like puzzles
Usually you cannot solve or even decipher the meaning of a device when you first see it and many devices are places to provide atmosphere to the game and are not part of any puzzle at all
Part of the enjoyment of games like Riven is to walk around and take in the local scenery
Enjoy the fruits of someone else s imagination
Try to figure out what is important and relavant to your situation
Overuse of walktrhoughs like this will ruin this sense of discovery lost in the rush to get through the game as quickly as possible
But enough about that
Here is a brief overview of how this solution is organized
The maps section gives a line drawing map of all of the important locations in the game and all of the walkways that link these locations
The solution section actually talks about the different locations what you need to accomplish in each location and sometimes why you need to accomplish it and gives you the order that you need to do stuff in
Because of the way the damaging information in the maps is hidden in hyperlinks the map section is generally spoiler free and can be used like a trail guide is used in a National Park
The solution section is not so safe MapsRiven also known as the Fifth Age is spread out over five islands
Names I have asigned the islands are based on what I think is the most important feature of the island
The major islands can also be identified by the CD that the island is located on
There is also a small section of the game set outside Riven one part in Ghen rd Age and another part in Tay
All of the maps share a common legend Paths are indicated in either red green or black the different colors are used to represent paths of differing altitudes
If two paths cross they actually meet if they are the same color and pass over or under each other if they are different colors
Where possible black paths are above the red paths but beneath the green paths
Important locations are drawn with a number in a black circle
Clicking on that circle will bring up a thumbnail view of that location to better orient yourself
The numbers are assigned arbitrarily and are used in the solution section of the game to describe locations more easily
Some locations may have paths of different colors entering and leaving the location
Sometimes it is possible to go from one height to another in a location usually visiting the section in question makes this obvious
All shorelines including the edges of islands are drawn in blue often with a blue border or solid area to indicate the direction that the water extends
Dashed black lines indicate borders between the CDs
Paths which you travel along but have no direct control over such as minecar paths will be shown in purple Riven You start the game at location TayThe rd AgeSolutionAll numbers refer to map locations in the general maps
Location numbers will always be written in arabic numbers ie while all other numbers will be written in english ie seventeen
Don t be afraid to explore areas that are open
There are many areas of the game that are accesable much earlier in the game then when they are visited in this solution
As far as I can tell it is impossible to lose anything break anything or make a puzzle unsolvable nor is it possible to get stuck anywhere physically and not be able to return to a location you have been previously
There is one way to lose the game but it is hard to do and not possible until near the end of the game Part I Generator IslandGenerator Island is the island that you start the game on
Atrus sends you here with a Prison book and his journal and tells you that you need to trick Ghen into using the Prison book so that he can imprison Ghen and rescue Catherine and all of the natives of Riven from the world before it disintegrates
He sends you here to location where you promply arrive in a cage
A native arrives talks in a strange language to you and takes the prison book
He is then ambushed by a rebel who takes the book but frees you
Start by heading up the stairs towards
You can look over the edge of the cliff to see the ambushed native if you like
Ignore the telescope at since you can t do anything with it for a long time
When you get to you can look into the room at
This room rotates it has five entrances with two doorways
The button next to the door rotates the room click it four times so that the doorways open to the entrances to your left and right
Then continue straight along the path
At you arrive at a gate
You can get around the gate by clicking underneath it
Enter to room and cross over to
At there is a steam switch with an icon of the telescope above it
You will see many of these kinds of switches in the game most devices in Riven are steam powered
This switch directs the steam from the ground beneath you to either the device if the switches is lowered or to the vent above you
Flip the switch
Head back to the doorway and pull the lever on the left
This opens up the gate that would block access to
Then push the button on the right twice to rotate the room so that the openings are at and
Cross the room to
At there is a door blocking access
Turn around and pull the lever here
This opens the gate that blocks access to
Now push the button twice to rotate the room so that you can cross back to then at push the button twice to allow access to
Then cross the room to
At walk across the bridge and enter the large domed building directly ahead at
This building is the main power generator for all of the devices on Riven
You can see pipes extending from this building to all of the other islands on Riven
This is why I named this island the Generator Island
Walk around the building and down the ramp until you get back outside
Here there are two more switches both of which control bridges at and that you should flip
Then head back down the path and return to the bridge at
Cross the bridge and head down the cavern tunnel
On the left there is a door that opens into
In there is a chair which I never figured out a use for although I believe it to be a communication device based on several similar devices you will see later
If you enter the room and turn back around there is a porthole thing on the left of the door
This displays a view of and the lever attached to the device opens and closes the door there
Open the door
The porthole on the right displays a view of
Return to the tunnel and head to
Head out the door to where there is a suspended tram station
Push the blue button to call the car and hop on board
The controls are fairly easy to understand the lever that looks like it turns circularly will turn the car around and the push lever in the middle causes the tram to move forward
Enjoy the ride the animation here is very well done
You arrive at the other end at Part II Forest IslandYou are now on Forest Island so named for the forests that grow and in some places used to grow here
At there is a small marble in the stone that rotates
When rotated you hear an animal sound and also see a Riven numeral
These Riven numbers are discussed in more detail when you arrive at a little later in the solution
Head through the caves to and turn right heading up the stairs
The button at will call the tram if you find that it isn t at when you need it
Head through the gate when you get to
Off the path in the jungle to your left there is a path that leads to another marble at
There is a large Riven dagger stuck in the ground here to let you know where this is
Continuing along the path through to you will arrive at a walkway where a sentry in a watchtower above you will sound an alarm
When you go down the walkway to you will see villagers here flee from you as quickly as they can
I thought this plus the language barrier was a nice way of minimizing interaction with others while avoiding the appearance of a wasteland like Myst was
Continue along the walkway
At there is a dock but nothing docked here
Near you will start climbing ladders and walking across elevated walks through the village
At there is something that looks very much like an altar or a shrine and a submarine
Pull the lever next to the submarine and it will lower into the water down to location
Now return down through the walkways and go to location
At there is a minecar
Jump into the minecar and pull the lever
The car will go through earthen tunnels under water and through elevated tracks all of the way to Part III Experiment IslandYou arrive in the central bay area of this island so named because Ghen does most of his experimenting on this island
You arrive at location but quickly slide down a chute to
From here walk out to
There is a three way switch here that controls the power to this island
Currently it is set to deliver power to move the switch to the middle setting so that power goes to
Then return to the shore and go to
At flip the side lever to turn off the heat in the tank
This will cause the water to stop boiling
Then turn the wheel to drain the water away
Now turn to your left and flip the small lever there on the pair of pipes
This will cause power to flow to the third control the switch that raises and lowers the platform inside the building
Go around and go inside at
Go down the ladder and crawl through the pipe
There will be several screens where it is pitch blank but eventually you will emerge at
When you come out of the pipe head down the path towards
On the balcony there is a ladder leading down
Open the hatch to the ladder since it can only be opened from this side
Then open the pair of double doors and go through them
Now close the doors since the passages leading to and are blocked when the doors are open
Head towards
Along the way there will be a lever on the right side of the path
Pull that lever then return to
If this area has power the device at can be used
You can open the steel sphere to reveal a bear trap like mechanism
Drag a piece of food from the dish on the right and put it in the center of the trap
Use the lever to lower the sphere into the water far below
After a few minutes you will hear the trap snap shut
Raise the trap back up and open it and you will have a frog
However this is completely unnecessary
If you look up there is a ventilation shaft
The switch you pulled near turns off the fan blades so that you can crawl safely through the vent and into
When you arrive you will see that is Ghen laboratory
The most important thing in this library is the journal laying on the desk beneath the vent
Inside you will find the access code to the linking book domes
It will look like five symbols inside squares in a row
The code is different every game so you have to copy down those symbols or skip ahead to the section on Riven numbers and just note down the numbers
Now go to the door with the blue button and open it
This leads back out to
Now head across the long bridge back towards the Generator Island
Right before you get to the end of the bridge there is a section raised up
Use the lever there to lower the bridge so you can re enter the generator Part IV Generator IslandHead inside the building and follow the catwalk around to
The wheel here when turned will extend the catwalk across to connect with
Now go to
A section of the walkway is missing here
Turn around and push the button this will raise the walkway and allow you to cross over to
The lever here will open the door
Return to location and face out towards
To your right is a lever
Pull the lever and this raises the stairs up
This causes the stairs to go from up to instead of to
However you don t know what to do at yet so lets leave
Return to via the bridge Part V Experiment IslandHead into the building at and exit out the other door to
There is another tram car
If the car is t here you can call it by pushing the blue button back at
Get in the tram and take it across to Part VI Map IslandAt take the left exit from the tram car and head out the door to and up the stairs to
Here there is a button that will raise you up to the next level
From here you can look back towards and see a map of the Riven islands
Pushing one of the buttons on the keypad will cause water to form on one of the land masses corresponding to its topographical shape
You can continue around to if you like this shows the location of another of the linking spheres
When you are done looking around head back down to via go through the tram until you are on the other platform and head down the passage to
At pull the lever to call the elevator
Inside push the button to descend
When you exit you will surprise Ghen in the passageway and he will run to
If you follow him you can see him leave in the tram
Don t follow him but head back to instead There is a chair here which offers a view of the undersea life
The left dial offers a view of the underwater area by pushing the right button and a view of Catherine s cell by pushing the left button
The right dial allows you to turn on various undersea lights
This allows you to associate each of the colors with each of the Riven symbols for that color
Note that the purple light is burned out
Alas
Now return to and take the tram across to the Forest Isle at Part VII Forest IslandAt take the corridor to
This is an elevator
You are currently on the ground floor
The middle floor leads to a secret exit through the mouth of a fish at
The button to call the tram is also located here
Taking the elevator all of the way to the top leads to the treetop walkway
This is where you want to go
Once up here head past the linking dome at to the building at
Sit in the chair in this building
The lever on the left will raise the chair up to a very high altitude and let you get a view of the entire village
If you look down you will see this teepee like structure
The lever on the right will close and open the floor of this structure
Leave the floor closed
Now lower the chair and head back towards the elevator
Take the middle exit down through and make your way across the island to continuing down the stairs to
At there are a pair of beached seal like creatures
Around the backside of the rocks where they are sitting is another marble
Continue along the passage to there is a pool with another marble in it
If you turn the dial on the bottom right of the pool water will flow into the pool to make the silhouette of an animal
Continue down the ladders to get to
The sub that you lowered from should be here
The controls in the sub are identical to those of the tram except that the go level is to the right and there is a slider along the bottom of the controls
This slider determines whether you will go left or right when you get to a junction
Follow the tracks to location
Climb the stairs here and you will get to a room that has five levers
These levers control whether the docking rings are extended or not
If the rings are not extended then the you cannot get to that dock with your sub
You will want to raise all of the levers
Now return to the sub
Take the sub to
This is a schoolhouse
Along the walls are the letters of the Riven alphabet
The important thing here is just to the left of the door
It is a nifty game there are two men dangling from ropes and a shark waiting below to eat them
Every time you turn the crank a random number is spun in the window below and the man whose turn it is drops that many notches on the rope
First one to twenty loses
This game lets you learn Riven numbers
You can easily pick up the values of the first ten numbers
Now notice that the multiples of five are just the values one through four rotated by ninety degrees
Riven numbers are base five The first digit is placed in a square normally the second digit is placed at right angles to that number
Subsequent digits are placed in new squares to the left
To read the numbers you take the rotated number multiply it by five and then add it to the non rotated number
See the example for seventeen above
If you have more than one digit then you multiply the left total by twenty five and add it to the right total
For example Ghen s world he called The left value is nine the right value is eight
The total is which is two hundred thirty three
Now that you know Riven numbers you can translate the numbers you found in Ghen s journal
Anyway now that you can count return to the sub and head to
When you exit the sub walk into the teepee area and pull the handle on the far side
This will lower a bar down to the ground
You can step into the middle of the area and grab the bar and ride up to the top
Once up here use the button to the right of the door to open the cell
Once inside the cell at lift up the drain in the floor and click there
This will raise a hidden switch that opens a secret door in the wall
Go through this door
The passageway you enter is completely dark
Eventually you will get to a seaview at
There is a light here that you can turn on by clicking it
As you walk back along the passage there are more lights that you can turn on they were hidden by the darkness
Turn around again and you will see the side door that leads to this time down
Head towards
contains a circle of stones that need to be lowered in exactly the right order
Each of the marbles that you saw earlier in the game were associated with one of the animals depicted on the stones
The number of the back of the marble determines the order to push the tablets in
Here are the pictures of the five stones that you need to push These stones are located in the following locations Facing the exit door the th stone from the left the st stone from the left turn to the right nd stone from the left turn to the right th stone from the left th stone from the left
This will open a shelf straight ahead that contains a linking book
Use the book to link to Tay Part VIII TayYou arrive in Tay at
This is the cover picture for the Riven box in case you hadn t noticed
There doesn t seem to be anything to do here so return to the linking boot at
You will be ambushed and imprisoned by the rebels here
They will take you to a room at where you will meet someone that brings you back the prison book and Catherine s journal
The important piece of information in the journal is the combination to the telescope that you saw back at the start of the game in location
It is a series of five Riven numbers and the combination is different every game
After you have taken the journal your captor returns with a linking book to return to to
Side note Now that you have the combination to the telescope you can go to it and break the fissure
Doing so before you have captured Ghen will cause Atrus to be summoned and captured and Ghen will escape Riven
When you have returned to head towards location
Note that to get through the secret door at you will have to lift the lever on the right side of the screen
You can also exit this upper area by going towards where you can lower a ladder to have permanent access between the upper and lower levels of the village area Part IX Generator IslandYou are now back in the rotating room at
Rotate the room so that an exit towards is available
You should have raised the stairs by now using the lever at so you have access to the generator s roof at now
Head up to
At head towards the device in the center of the dome
There is a grid twenty five holes square and six marbles along the right side
The grid is divided up into five regions that are the same regions depicted on the Map Island map
What you need to do is locate the five linking domes use the Map Island map to determine where on the grid the dome is located determine what the color of the dome is by using the viewfinder located near each dome and then place the marble for that dome in the grid
Or just look at the diagram below for the proper placement of the gems
Using text mode coordinates assuming that the lower left corner is then the red marble goes at the orange at the green at the blue at and the purple at
Now head back pull the lever down and push the white button
You know you ve done it right if you hear a drilling like sound after pushing the white button
This now gives power to all of the linking book domes
Now return to the inside of the dome via location
This can be done by pushing the button at location three times
Head to the lower level of the dome and exit heading towards and go to location
Push the button against the wall and the floor will descend to the lowest level
This will allow you to get to the linking book dome at
To use the linking book domes
Nearby each dome is a dome viewer
For the dome at the viewer is right in front of the dome
For other domes it is always nearby
The dome at deserves special mention the viewer is hidden in a passage that is blocked when the door to the room containing the dome is open
To get access to the dome you need to hit the button on the viewer just before the dome color symbol appears
You can always tell what that symbol is by watching the pictures in the viewer
There is always a short pause on the dome s color symbol and it is always highlighted
You will have to anticipate the symbol some
Now head to the dome and set the five sliders to the five numbers that you found in Ghen s journal and push the button
Then use the book to link
You can push the button at the base of the bookstand to exit the dome
Go into the dome at and link to Age where Ghen is hiding Part X Age You arrive here at location in a cage
Side note locations through are all in this room
Turn around until you see a button just outside the cage
This button is located in the direction of
This will call Ghen to the chamber
He gives you a long speech about how he has changed takes the prison book from you when he notices that you have recovered it is about to use it when he gets suspicious and then asks that you go first
If you remember from reading Atrus s journal the prison book is aone man prison if a second person uses the book then the first is released
So go ahead and enter the prison book
Ghen will quickly follow releasing you from the prison and entrapping himself in
You are now free to explore the room
Locations through are linking books that link to the following locations respectively and
Location is a generator for making power to these linking books
The slider turns it on and off
The power is on if the red window below the lever glows
is a writing table with Ghen s newest book
is a doorway leading outside
Unfortunately there is no way to open it
is a lever that opens the cage
is a stairwell that descends down to Ghen s bedroom at
Take that stairwell down
Inside his bedroom on the nightstand is Ghen s personal journal
More importantly next to the journal is a sphere that when clicked will play five tones that are either dings cranks like a wrench or clanks and this combination is different every game
Make a note of the tones that you hear from the device
Return to and link through that book
The linking book has but one square on the cover
Part XI Catherine s IslandYou arrive at Catherin s Island at
Head down the path to the building where there is an elevator
The device against the back wall is the lock for the cage
Click on the pedals to duplicate the five tones that the device at made and flip the lever
This will open the cage
You will rise up to the top level where Catherine will greet you and congradulate you
She will tell you to return to the telescope and open the fissure
Head back to the linking globe at link back to Ghen s world and then link to using the book at the book with five squares on the cover Part XII Generator IslandHead to location
Look at the left leg of the telescope
There is a device in the support that prevents the telescope from dropping beneath a certain level
Remove that support
Then click on the cover in the center of the telescope
Key in the combination from Catherine s journal numbering the buttons from one to five left to right then click on the handle to open the cover
Now look at the button on the right side of the telescope railing
Twist the handle around the button until it is pointing down and then push the button until the telescope breaks through the glass covering the fissure
The fissure breaks Catherine and Atrus are reunited and in a fit of madness they throw you into the fissure
It makes much more sense when you watch the ending

ldquo RIVEN rdquo Some Supplementary Hints
Len Green th August lengreen hotmail com Preamble
ldquo Riven The Sequel to Myst rdquo is a brilliant game for its time Its creation of a fictitious virtual world is breathtaking and stunning However its admirable open endedness resulted in considerable complexity for me Not being brilliant I needed quite a lot of hints I found some walkthroughs on the Net but a few instances presented particular difficulties for me and the explanations were insufficient My purpose here is to simply supplement just four problematic or interesting parts of the game
Some Hints amp Tips
Avery minor issue purely and pedantically academic Having some experience of math and physics I found the Riven numerical system extremely interesting Its then rotation for their times multiples is in itself intriguing and the simple combinations easily giving any number from to is nice However unless I am mistaken over and above this Riven rsquo slargernumbers not actually lsquo utilized rsquo in the game involving more than one digit arebase not as seemingly base For example Age is derived from The reference in Ghen rsquo s diary to the th Age is derived similarly Very clever you could express just a little under decimal in merely Rivenese digits all based essentially on only symbols
Immediately after this I personally ran into trouble finding the Viewer for the lsquo Generator Isle rsquo Linking Book dome Somehow or another I lsquo got lost rsquo not exactly difficult in the islands of Riven I guess that many had no trouble at all with this but maybe got stuck elsewhere
But in case anyone elsedidhave similar trouble possibly the following description may be helpful Arrange the marbles correctly down reverse forward reverse pull the lever down exposing the white button press this button if you have lsquo lost your marbles rsquo nothing happens apart from a lsquo click rsquo the evidence that you havesucceededis that the long vertical thin rod quivers into action followed by a continuous faint whirring sound leave the switch down reverse forward twice down the stairs across the bridge and into the opened lsquo gold room rsquo click on the open exit to your front right times which takes you out of the exit and to the beginning of the bridge but don rsquo t cross click right or left twice to reverse forward and press the button to rotate the inner cylindrical wall times at which point the open rear entrance appears forward click on the open exit to your front right times which brings you to the beginning of the lsquo walkway rsquo forward times and you follow the arc round and into the dome forward times to the catwalk left follow the catwalk all the way forward times down the stairs forward times click left once and then forward times to get right outside the exit and all the way round the arc of the pathway and up to the opening of the tunnel but don rsquo t go in click right to home in on the button press it and the elevator will take you down a floor click right or left then reverse forward times to the stairs forward times up the stairs and phffewwwww you rsquo ve made it to the Viewer of the Linking Book dome on Generator Island
Another aspect which took me a while to figure out was the dragging of the sliders underneath the above Linking Book particularly since the graduations are not marked too clearly
The sliders are always bunched up on the left hand side I found it easiest to first drag themallto the extreme right even though the lsquo counting rsquo always starts from the left In my particular case the numbers it rsquo s said that they rsquo re different for each game
I lsquo translated rsquo from Ghen rsquo s journal were from left to right presumably whatever the numbers are they mustalwaysbe in ascending order So I dragged the now left most slider towards the left to the longer markfrom the left and so on finishing with the last remaining slider at present on the mark and moving it position to the left making it a total of from the left I hope this is clear for anyone who has trouble with this Incidentally wheneveryou press the button beneath the sliders all sliders always click back to their initial left most positions if you have done it wrong then nothing happens after this and you have to try again but if you have done it correctly all five slidersalsomove back to their initial left most positions and almost immediately afterwards the dome opens up and the Linking Book becomes accessible
Another place where I couldn rsquo t readily make out lsquo whether I was coming or going rsquo or fathom out the logic of things was early on arrival at lsquo Experiment Island rsquo Part III Again others may have had no trouble whatsoever here and found it easy
Nevertheless to clarify the various actions hellip hellip hellip On arrival at Experiment Island first go forward down the ladder forward right twice forward left all the way to the end of the narrow platform to the middle of the lake forward drag the valve lever to the middle one of its positions thereby delivering steam power to thewholeof the boiler house mechanisms reverse back along the platform forward left up the stairs forward left twice forward which brings you to the Y junction valve with the leverawayfrom you but don rsquo t touch it yet since it is at present delivering essential power to the boiler system right brings you to the boiler controls turn the valve lever near the right edge of the screen upwards thereby turning off the flames and stopping the water from boiling and bubbling turn the wheel lever from to o'clock to raise the wide tube and empty the water left to return to the Y valve and pull the lever towards you thereby diverting the steam into the lsquo near rsquo pipe which is the one that controls the floor mechanism right and lift the handle near mid screen to raise the floor inside right twice forward left forward and the hatch door is released noisily and opens automatically forward and into the large circular pipe twice forward and into total blackness and after this it should be relatively straightforward

Green key with red top and blue left prongs
Yellow key with red left prongs
Blue key with brown left prongs
Green key with purple top and yellow prongs Numbers and above should be place in the grated window one on top of another
It does not matter if you place them or the order is interchangeable as long as you use the correct three panels
You will witness a display of twinkling fairy dust and a stairway magically opens under the golden key pedestal embedded in the stone floor Descend down the darkened stairway Chapter The Lotus Pool Maze There is no apparent step by step solution to successfully navigate the Lotus Pool Maze It appears rather that you need only to wander about the maze for approximately ten real time minutes Note Road to India players have offered that they found it easier to navigate the maze by keeping the tinging bell noise in the center each time they moved
Others have suggested that if you listen carefully to whether the tinging bell is coming from your left or right stereo speaker that is the direction you should go
The most effective and apparently the correct method is to follow the little rat you see scampering from room to room
The doorway where he stops leads to the hallway you need to enter next
Just keep following him
You may return unexpectedly to the steps again
Each time that happens just start out again in any direction After about ten minutes have passed another friendly rat will appear complete with chirping sounds Follow him and note at which doorway he stops and chirps at you Go forward through that doorway and the next chamber You will see Mr Rat again in the next chamber and he will lead you with his progressive chirping to the next doorway This happens about or times before you are lead to a wall with a radiating blue light in the center

In inventory combine the door handle with the chain and throw this device over the lever to the left of the altar In a cutscene Fred will be able to lasso the lever and shut down the flames in the moat Cross the bridge and see Fred's dreamed reunion with his beloved Anusha Chapter Back to Reality After a cutscene in which Fred is seen beating on the door of his temporary cell a dark hot little room

The End GameBoomers Walkthroughs and Solutions
RUNAWAY A Road Adventure WALKTHROUGH August th Revised th September Len Green lengreen hotmail com FOREWORD Try not to use this walkthrough AT ALL The game is not too difficult and with patience you can probably overcome your stuckness
There are no slider or timed puzzles mazes cryptology boners or music chess math and other headaches that some players dislike Also there are no protracted dialog trees or volumes of text to plough through As far as I remember there are absolutely no illogical puzzles such as combining an elephant with a corkscrew
To the best of my recollection there are not TOO many items in inventory I don rsquo t remember ever reaching and most of the time there are only between about a half and one dozen As far as I remember all the items in inventory are actually used during the game
Within each chapter there is quite a lot of flexibility in the order of performing many but not all actions and exploring various locations so you do not have to follow the order below But as in most Quest Adventure games there are some actions youmustperform amp or locations youmustvisit before you can progress to others From time to time you have to return to previous locations objects or people and sometimes maybe to your surprise receive additional items amp or hints Often you may try to do something with no success hellip later as a result of some triggering action or hint from somebody the identical location object or person will react with something essential
Below are only the VITAL actions you need to do to finish the game Most discussions and non essential actions some mildly humorous amp or containing clues for progress are not included here hellip but I would recommend performing as many as possible so as to enjoy the game to the maximum fully participate in the story and progress without assistance
A great deal of the narrative is developed through cutscenes triggered when you have concluded certain sections in particular a very great deal of chapter is made up of cutscenes This walkthrough contains spoilers of course But I have deliberately refrained from spoiling the story line by detailingANYcutscenes hellip many of which may come as quite an entertaining surprise to players
In this game you CANNOTget lsquo killed rsquo even though the thugs are after you all through the game But just the same it rsquo s worth saving pretty frequently in case you get stuck N B
There is an unlimited number of save slots certainly over a hundred At first you move from location to location by a single left click of your mouse But after that you can if you wish double click which takes you directly to your destination immediately
As always pick up every item possible and exhaust all dialogs with as many folk as you can
PREFACE Initially I highlighted a few places where youmusttalk to somebody or read or do something etc before a certain object or location which was previously inert becomes active
However this game is absolutely FULL of such situations Hence it rsquo s logical to either highlightallof these situations or elsenoneat all IMO it would be misleading to include just the few cases which happened to occur to me
Since it would be almost impossible to search for and include them all I later decided to include none and to therefore delete all those which I had originally included I left just the first one in as an example of the above see hellip hellip but there arevery many morethroughout the game
WAKE ME BEFORE DYING View all the intros and cutscenes You finish up with Gina lying in a hospital ward sleeping VERY deeply in bed She is drugged so heavily that you can rsquo t wake her up in order to get away quickly before the baddies catch up with her and Brian

There is a fire alarm sprinkler on the ceiling Use your spray can on it

Take the brush and container of talcum powder to the left of the helium tank and look at them in inventory hellip they look like a police finger printing kit
Look at the briefcase containing varnishes hellip to the right of the skeleton rsquo s head
Take a bottle of colorless varnish
Exit Olivaw rsquo s room Get Brian to turn left and walk towards the right edge of the screen Go past the Analysis Laboratory and panel and descend the stairs to the exhibition area
Talk to the Janitor Willy He rsquo ll give you his lsquo business rsquo card William P Dustin with telephone number
No matter which of the dialog choices you make almost immediately his mobile phone will ring and he rsquo ll receive an order from a customer Mr Potter hellip Harry
He jives upstairs to the Analysis Lab operates the tone keypad and enters
Brian realizes he rsquo s operating a racket
Willy won rsquo t emerge so long as Brian is in the exhibition area So get Brian to temporarily enter the Mayan Art Exhibition or back upstairs As soon as Brian returns Willy rsquo s back there again Continue the dialog tree to the end
Go back upstairs and use the transparent varnish on the numerical tone keypad panel
Get Brian to go past the stairs towards the right edge of the screen and use the public telephone there
Watch the cutscene where Brian talks to Willy and gets him to enter the Analysis Lab again
Enter and exit the Mayan Art Exhibition again to get Willy back sitting downstairs
Return to the keypad and sprinkle the talcum fingerprint powder on it
keys have been pressed hellip numbers amp You do not however know the order of these digits
The crudest way of determining the digit number is by lsquo ordered rsquo trial and error until you hit upon the correct number There are different combinations not a VERY big job
A better way is to listen to the tones emitted hellip you can do that as many times as you wish
If you are tone impaired the order of both tones and numbers is the lsquo highest rsquo the lsquo lowest rsquo the lsquo one above the lowest rsquo and finally the lsquo one below the highest rsquo Enter the Analysis Lab
Look at the strange golden object close to the door It rsquo s a key hellip Take it
Underneath it is a note Read it The key belongs to Clive
Try to open the thermal chamber You can rsquo t do that manually
Press the button of the voice recognition lock You are given a choice of names but none fits Brian rsquo s voice
Exit the Analysis Lab Brian turns right i e
towards the left edge of the screen and walks past the Restoration Laboratory and the fire extinguisher
Continue and enter Clive rsquo s Office
Pick up the anthropology books on Clive rsquo s desk This exposes a crack which looks like a keyhole to open a lock
Use the strange golden key with the crack and a hidden safe slides open
You can rsquo t take papers or money but there is a device a voice recorder there hellip borrow it
Exit Clive rsquo s Office hellip you must close the safe first
Return to the Restoration Lab Use the voice recorder on Dr Olivaw and get a recording of her name and voice
Return to the Analysis Lab no problem about entering now
Use the voice recorder on the voice recognition button The recorder starts but immediately fizzles out hellip the battery is dead
Walk to the far side of the Analysis Lab i e
to the extreme right edge of the screen and look at the cylinder of liquid nitrogen You can rsquo t do anything with it as is because it rsquo s too dangerous
Hanging on the wall a little to the left of and above the cylinder is a ladle hellip grab it
In inventory place the dead battery into the ladle hellip it fits nicely
Dip the ladle with the battery into the liquid nitrogen and remove it The battery has been cooled down to a very low temperature
In inventory place the frozen battery into the voice recorder
Put the voice recorder onto the button of the voice recognition pad
The chamber opens Fairly quickly take the Mayan Mask from inside The chamber will close in seconds but if you haven rsquo t got the Mask by then you can repeat and as many times as you need to
You can try to take the red ruby from the forehead of the Mayan Mask but you can rsquo t remove it with your bare hands So in inventory prize the ruby out using the strange Mayan object
Return to the Restoration Lab
Walk towards the right to the laser
Replace the small ruby in the laser with the huge one you got from the mask
Dr Olivaw uses the powerful laser on the artifact she rsquo s restoring and it smashes into little pieces
This has never happened to her before hellip she needs an iced mocha coffee to calm her nerves and continue working
Exit the Restoration Lab Brian turns right i e
towards the left edge of the screen and walks past Clive rsquo s Office to the coffee machine
There rsquo s a red warning light on hellip looks as though the machine may be out of coffee Try it just the same It IS out of coffee
Continue a step or two turn right and go downstairs Get Brian to walk past Willy and enter the Mayan Art Exhibition
In the middle of the chamber is a statue of a Mayan King with some bowls at his feet hellip seems they hold seeds and stuff like that
Look at the Maya rsquo s bowls and jars Mayan Objects and Brian automatically picks up a bowl of seeds that look like coffee beans
Go to Willy talk to him and try to get him to fill the coffee machine Nothing doing
Show him your lsquo coffee rsquo beans He says that apart from looking strange they rsquo re no good since the machine will only take ground coffee
Go upstairs and enter the Restoration Lab again Dr Olivaw is still moaning beside her laser On one corner of her unoccupied desk is an electric lathe Use your beans on it You get a bowl of ground lsquo coffee like stuff rsquo
Return to Willy and hand him your ground lsquo coffee rsquo hellip he doesn rsquo t like the look of it understandably and in any case he rsquo ll only use the museum rsquo s regular Java ground coffee
Upstairs again Look at the wastebasket below the fire extinguisher There rsquo s an empty packet of museum brand coffee there Take it
In inventory fill the empty packet with your ground lsquo coffee rsquo
Downstairs to Willy again Give him the lsquo new rsquo packet He goes off and fills the machine hellip upstairs the red light is off now
Use the coffee machine to get a cup of hot lsquo coffee rsquo
Re enter the Restoration Lab and give the lsquo coffee rsquo to Dr Olivaw She perks up goes back to work with a vengeance and collapses Brian takes the cleaned crucifix Whilst this is going on the hoods arrive outside the museum and prepare to enter it hellip with very evil intents
Exit the Restoration Lab
Enter the Analysis Lab
This triggers a long cutscene The high tech scanner reveals a clear picture of the restored crucifix and some relevant details hellip there rsquo s some mention of the Arizona tribe of Hopi Indians The crooks go completely on the rampage and finish by capturing Brian and Gina They are transported by helicopter to an old cabin hellip somewhere
THE GREAT ESCAPE Brian wakes up after having been pistol whipped Through a crack in the door he sees Gina being very roughly interrogated by a couple of thugs in the adjoining room He has to get them both away from there
Have a good look around There are various items that may be useful Try the two windows hellip no egress from either The door is obviously out of the question
Look at the freezer Try to move it you can rsquo t it rsquo s too heavy hellip if it rsquo s full
To the right of the telephone is a bottle of cleanser Pick it up
To the left of the freezer is a chamois rag Take it
Just a little to the left of the rag is an iron crowbar Grab it
And just a little to the left of the crowbar and on the floor is a round piece of wood It rsquo s a peg which has fallen down from the coat rack on the wall Pick it up
Across the other side of the room midway between the door and the barred window is a bellows Take it
In inventory moisten the rag with cleanser
Use the cleaning rag with the filthy window above the freezer hellip ldquo Let the sunshine in rdquo
Open the lid of the freezer to allow it to defrost hellip it rsquo s full of huge blocks of ice
You need to remove the freezer rsquo s electric plug from its wall socket for quick defrosting
The ice has all melted into water but that rsquo s just as heavy hellip and you still can rsquo t move the freezer
There rsquo s a bung at the bottom of the freezer near the electric socket Pull this out and all the water drains out
Move the much lighter freezer hellip revealing a trapdoor beneath it hellip Eureka
The trapdoor is closed with a padlock Use your crowbar to pry it off
Open the trapdoor
Escape outside via the opened trapdoor
There is now quite a long cutscene involving the three characters Carla Lola and Mariola hellip also Brian rsquo s three part operational plan for progressing Brian finishes up outside the trio rsquo s broken down bus
PART of Brian rsquo s escape plan Outside the middle of the bus is a prop trunk Look inside it The only item of interest is a deflated basket ball which needs stitching hellip nevertheless take it
Enter the bus On the left is what looks like a triple bunk bed Sticking out from underneath it on the floor to the left of the teddy bear is a white object which looks like a handle to something
That white object is actually a hand held vacuum cleaner hellip pick it up
Opposite the beds on an upturned trunk are shelves The right hand shelf is full of a pile of lipsticks Take one
Just below the lipsticks is a pair of sunglasses Grab them
Walk to the back of the bus and talk to Carla hellip exhaust all dialogs She gives some useful info
Try to obtain Carla rsquo s lost pill from the grating You can rsquo t hellip The grating rsquo s firmly fixed to the floor
Use your vacuum cleaner on the grating Bingo
hellip you have the pill
Behind Carla on a low table between a pair of high boots are a large needle and thick shoe repair thread hellip pick them up
Exit the bus lsquo Walk off rsquo the right edge of your screen
MAP You have already visited locations theThugs rsquo cabinand theDrag Queen Bus There are more locations marked with question marks rsquo s which will be labeled but only after you visit them first time You will have to visit them ALL eventually and probably more than once and do things at each during chapter of the game The order in which you visit them is unimportant Since there are stages to the escape plan the order in which different players will tackle these will vary hellip but this will not affect the outcome since theyallhave to be completed sooner or later
But as in many Quest Adventure games there are some locations youmustvisit and actions youmustperform before you can make any progress at certain other locations
Some players may wish to make the round of ALL the locations immediately doing whatever seems possible at each before settling upon a plan of action s You certainly cannot doanyharm by so doing But this walkthrough with the advantage of hindsight will try to deal with actions as far as possible in some lsquo logical rsquo order
On the map go to the location to the upper right of the Thugs rsquo cabin It looks similar to a double sized version of same but turns out to be aHangarwith a tough guy guarding it There rsquo s no way you rsquo re going to let him see you
Look at the barred doors hellip there rsquo s a crack there There rsquo s a helicopter inside
Try to enter the doors Instead you circle behind the hangar on the side away from the guard and enter through a rear window
Attempt to grab a can of beer from behind the muscle man whenever he places one on the drum You can alwaysreachthem but are frightened he may see you
Mixing Carla rsquo s pill with alcohol makes a potent knock out draught How about trying that
As before he rsquo ll kill you literally if he catches sight of you You rsquo re going to have to find a way of distracting him
Return to outside the bus where Lula rsquo s limbering up with her musical aerobics Try to get her to help you hellip Nothing doing
In inventory use your needle and thread to repair the basketball
Also in inventory inflate the basketball with the bellows Good
hellip it holds
Throw the ball to Lula As you suspected earlier Lula is an ex professional basketball player called Lou Lamerre with a lsquo history rsquo She he rather reluctantly agrees to get Mr Biceps Rocco Wallace out of range hellip albeit with a couple of conditions
You rsquo re all set with Brian at his side window behind the hunk and Lula ready for a competition You have to be only reasonably speedy with the next action hellip but if you flunk it you can repeat as often as you like and need Whilst Lulu is playing lsquo toss the cans rsquo with Rocco fairly quickly spike his beer with Carla rsquo s pill
The hunk drinks the doctored beer and is physically paralyzed The door to the Hangar is open and free access to the chopper is enabled Go round the zombie the macho man and look at the motor cycle and bottle of peanut butter with spatula hellip N B These items were inactive previously
PART of Brian rsquo s escape plan Take the peanut butter
Listen carefully to the stud rsquo s comments
Watch the following carefully Whack the motorcycle with your crowbar A piece of metal drops off not too easy to see on the ground
The piece of metal is a motor cycle ldquo sidekick rsquo s rdquo foot rest hellip pick it up
Go to the junk pile in the bottom left hand corner of the monitor screen there IS a ldquo rdquo there but it rsquo s a bit difficult to see It is anAirplane graveyard
Look at the machine gun in the gunner rsquo s cockpit and try to move it It rsquo s all rusted up from disuse and would need a good grease up to operate
On the stump of the plane rsquo s broken off right hand wing is a World War II infantry helmet Take it
Hanging over the side of the gunner rsquo s seat and near to the machine gun is an empty bullet belt Pick it up
Return to the bus and look at Mariola who rsquo s sunbathing on the bonnet hood Look at the suntan lotion hellip it contains carrot extract
Try to get the lotion by asking Mariola if you could borrow it No dice hellip she needs it for a sufficient tan
See if you can get her sunglasses when she takes them off and puts them on the hood of the bus Apparently not a good idea
Go to the ldquo rdquo location nearest to the top left hand corner of the map It rsquo s anOil well
Walk forward to the oil puddle and dip your sunglasses from inventory into the oil This gives them a darker tint
Return to Mariola When she puts her sunglasses down exchange the for your darker ones
Ask Mariola again if you could borrow her lotion She looks at herself and is satisfied with her lsquo dark tan rsquo You take her suntan oil
Return to the Airplane graveyard
Grease the machine gun with the tanning oil It rsquo s now operational and the Thugs rsquo cabin is within shooting range It should shoot hellip if Brian can obtain any ammunition that is
Return to the Thugs rsquo cabin On the ground almost exactly below the rocking chair is an old battered bucket Take it
Go to the ldquo rdquo location near to the top right hand corner of the map It rsquo s anOld abandoned train car
Walk towards the right and enter the old freight car A little to the right of the entrance almost middle screen is a barrel of gunpowder Brian wouldn rsquo t mind getting some but the gunpowder barrel is closed up tight
Try putting your battered bucket from inventory onto the barrel of gunpowder Not a satisfactory idea Near to the bottom left hand corner of the screen is an old bucket containing oodles of screws Grab one
Try drilling a hole in the gunpowder barrel with your screw You can rsquo t hellip it rsquo s impossible for your fingers to get a proper grip on the screw to turn it
In inventory look again at your coat rack peg It has an octagonal opening Still in inventory fit it together with the screw and you have a makeshift corkscrew Presto
Try boring a hole in the barrel with your makeshift corkscrew to collect some gunpowder You can rsquo t do that unless you have something to collect the gunpowder in
Again put your battered bucket onto the barrel of gunpowder Now it will stand on the floor below the barrel Apply your corkscrew again and gunpowder pours from the barrel filling the bucket
Pick up the bucket of gunpowder
In inventory place the lipstick into the bucket of gunpowder and you obtain a high caliber bullet
Again in inventory put the bullet onto the empty bullet belt Cool It fits hellip but one bullet will hardly be enough
Return to the bus and grab all the rest of the pile of lipsticks from the previous same right hand shelf
In inventory place the pile of lipsticks into the bucket of gunpowder and you obtain a quantity of bullets A coincidence hellip there is just enough gunpowder to fill all of the lipsticks
In inventory again fit the pile of bullets into the bullet belt Another coincidence hellip there are exactly the correct number of bullets to fill the whole bullet belt
Back to the airplane graveyard Fit the belt of bullets into the machine gun It rsquo s now ready for firing
PART of Brian rsquo s escape plan Try to open the refrigerator You can rsquo t hellip it rsquo s locked According to Carla the other lsquo girls rsquo have hidden the key to stop her from gorging too much butter She has looked and looked but hasn rsquo t found it
In the front of the bus is an axle to the left of the shelves holding necklaces and earrings etc
a little below and to the right of center screen It lsquo s cross section is hexagonal Try turning the axle hellip but there rsquo s no way of doing that manually
Use the motorcycle foot rest as a crank on the axle
Turn the makeshift crank on the axle and the folding door of the bus closes Look at it carefully
There is a pocket of leather on the inside of the door hellip not visible when the door is open
Look inside the pocket and take the key
Use the key to open the fridge door and take the large tub of brand new butter from inside
Return to the Old abandoned train car location
On the extreme left of the screen is an ant hill and to the right of it an old hut probably containing explosives The tough guy said something about peanut butter causing the ants to go on a wood eating frenzy Maybe all this adds up to a plan
Enter the freight car again To the left of the broken clock are barrels supporting one other on top One of the barrels only is closed hellip the others are open and empty
Open the sealed barrel with your crowbar and get hellip hellip a package of shelled peanuts which are not TOO stale
In inventory put the butter and the peanuts into the infantry helmet Hopefully this will give you something resembling peanut butter Maybe hellip but the mixture needs melting and stirring
Return to the Thug rsquo s cabin It lsquo s stupid and impossible to enter the front door But close to the pile of tires and a bit difficult to see is an entry through the escape trapdoor Enter the rear room of the cabin
N B It might not be too obvious that you CAN re enter the Thugs rsquo cabinwhenever you need to hellip and you CERTAINLY NEED TO HERE
Place the helmet containing the mixture of butter and peanuts onto the freezer hellip its lid is now sizzling hot from the sun
Stir with the spatula from the bottle of authentic peanut butter and hellip
You have a helmet full of ersatz peanut butter
Return to the Old abandoned train car location Splash the load of lsquo peanut butter rsquo over the narrow wooden hut containing explosives
A myriad of ants from the adjoining ant hill descend upon the hut and eat up the wood in no time leaving a pile of sawdust
All that is left is enough dynamite to blow up a mountain together with its detonation equipment Take it all
Go to the Oil well and fix the dynamite and detonation equipment onto it Watch the VERY long cutscene in which the whole escape plan is put into operation After this there is a pretty long introduction to chapter
CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE FOURTH KIND Brian and Gina arrive in Hopi territory Gina has an accident and Wupuchim materializes He is a Hopi chief and gives advice to Brian who continues alone arriving at a deserted town called Douglasville Exhaust all dialog options with Sushi Douglas and learn about the history of Douglasville
Enter the sheriff rsquo s office and look around
There rsquo s a cell with a year old dead man inside it There rsquo s nothing you can do about him since the cell is locked
Take the pile of wood stacked alongside the cell hellip nice logs
Enter the wrecked bank and look around
Behind the cash register are shelves broken and open Take the metallic object from the bottom shelf It rsquo s an old fashioned stapler with only staples like old rivets used by cobblers
Look at what was probably J T Douglas rsquo desk roughly center screen and get something from it It rsquo s a bank stamp hellip with the letters ldquo BD rdquo Bank of Douglasville embossed on it
A huge blunt instrument has made a large hole to the basement at the bottom middle of the screen Brian doesn rsquo t see why he should try to go down there
Return and talk to Sushi again Find out all about the dead man in the cell and the safe in the basement of the bank
Go back to the bank and try to go down to the basement using the large hole That doesn rsquo t work hellip there rsquo s too much dirt and rubble
Enter the saloon the building at the bottom right corner of the screen
Just below the foot of the stairs is a flower pot hellip take it
Immediately to the right of the foot of the stairs is an opening to a small room hellip it rsquo s a gardening shed Go in and have a look around for something useful You come out with a pair of pruning shears
Go upstairs and talk to the guy who rsquo s sculpting there His name is Kevin but everybody calls him Saturn Exhaust all dialog options with him and get more info
Look at the statues and other items up there Around the middle of the room is a wood and metal device On it stands a pound bucket of red paint
Pull the lever on the device hellip maybe it rsquo s some kind of brake
GEEZ It rsquo s a catapult and the bucket of paint is launched sky high landing in the ruins of the bank Saturn is NOT amused
Go to the bank and look at the results of Brian rsquo s not minding his own business i e
the wasted red paint
Between the hotel and the sheriff rsquo s office is a passageway Look at the supply wagon there and the strapping attached to it
Use your pruning shears to cut off to yards of strapping
Leave town bottom left hand corner of your monitor screen and you rsquo re on another map hellip see
Go to the ldquo rdquo fairly near to the bottom right hand corner of the map hellip Mama Dorita rsquo s house
Exhaust all dialogs with Oscar the huge but placid guy who is guarding the entrance to the house You can rsquo t get past him to see Mama Dorita Oscar is constantly chewing ldquo menthol chewin rsquo tobacky rdquo hellip it helps him pass the time
To the left of Oscar is a ladder leaning up against a wall Look at and pick up the clay vessel that rsquo s on the ground next to the ladder
Move back towards a skull and shrunken head On the ground beside the well to the right of the skull is an unusually artistic weird looking stone with a hole in the middle like a doughnut Pick it up
Return to the map and go to the ldquo rdquo location near to the top right of the map It rsquo s aCraterand when Brian descends he meets Joshua a strange man wearing a telepathic helmet for communicating with ldquo Trantor rdquo and other extra terrestrials Exhaust all dialogs with Joshua He has a very large lsquo communication machine rsquo which is supposed to open a door and facilitate contact with these beings Trouble is the machine rsquo s rotor is not receiving any power and hence won rsquo t work
Brian has the bright idea of hitching the rear wheel of Joshua rsquo s motorcycle to the communication machine and gives him the long strap
But first the strap has to be made into a large loop In inventory use the ancient stapler to join the ends of the strap
Leave Joshua for minutes He hasn rsquo t done it Brian should have threaded the strap through the rear axle first but forgot The only solution is to remove the rear wheel of the motor cycle But Joshua needs a number wrench to do this hellip and he hasn rsquo t got one
Return to Douglasville Enter the saloon Go upstairs to Saturn and talk to him hellip lsquo You see ldquo mon ami rdquo there rsquo s something I wanted to ask you hellip rsquo Then ask him for a number wrench He tells you to take it from the set of tools hanging on the wall
Go to the tool board Look at it and take a number wench DARN All the wrenches are there except the particular one you need
Talk to Saturn again He forgot he just used it and it rsquo s in his pocket He carelessly flips it over But Brian fails to catch it and the wrench flies through the open door across the balcony and down into the street
Go down to the street The wrench doesn rsquo t seem to be there Hold on hellip it rsquo s submerged in a literally stinking trough Brian is NOT going to stick his hand into that mess
Go back into the saloon upstairs and out onto the balcony
About half way along the balcony and next to the middle fold back door and fairly easily overlooked is an object on the floor Pick it up It is a sanding block
Drop the flower pot onto the street
Go downstairs and out The trough has been overturned Get the wrench
Return to the crater Give the wrench to Joshua He says it will take him minutes So leave and immediately return
Trouble again Joshua tells Brian that his motorcycle has run out of gasoline
Back once more toDouglasville and talk with Saturn Again talk to him hellip lsquo You see ldquo mon ami rdquo there rsquo s something I wanted to ask you hellip rsquo Then ask him for some gasoline Problem hellip consumables
He can onlybarterthese with you hellip he wants something artistic and inspirational made by Brian in exchange for his can of gasoline
Give Saturn your strange stone No
too crude and rough hellip unfinished
Polish up the stone with your sanding block and try again It rsquo s still not inspirational amp or artistic enough for him hellip incomplete
In inventory place your amber stone into the hole in the strange stone Hooray hellip this makes a lsquo stone of light rsquo and is now sufficiently arty crafty for Saturn He tells Brian to stand it in the doorway in the sun FINE Brian can help himself to the can of gasoline hellip it rsquo s a deal
NOTE Coming up are very old chestnuts in novel disguises They stretch back over a quarter of a century on computers The puzzles themselves one in the form of a game were around a long time before personal computers came on the scene
Saturn ldquo Oh by the way just one problem rdquo hellip hellip hellip
The gasoline in the tank is concentrated To get the correct dilution you must mix liter of water with CCs of the concentrated gasoline And incidentally there is no CC measuring tube hellip just one of CC and one of CC
In inventory you now have a can of concentrated gasoline a liter empty bottle and two empty measuring tubes one of CC and the other of CC
Just to the left of the middle door to the balcony is a green colored gallon water machine From it fill your liter bottle with water
There is more than one way of solving the rest of this puzzle The simplest method is described below A Fill the CC tube with concentrated gas from the container
B Fill the CC tube from the CC tube leaving CC in the CC tube
C Pour the whole contents of the CC tube back into the gas can so that the CC tube is now empty
D Pour the remaining CC of concentrated gas from the CC tube into the CC tube leaving the CC tube empty
E Fill the CC tube again from the concentrated gas can
F Remembering that the CC tube has CC of concentrated gas in it already fill it from the full CC tube Only CC can be transferred from the CC tube to the CC tube and so CC of concentrated gas are left in the CC tube
Pour your CC of concentrated gasoline from the CC tube into the liter bottle of water making your correct usable mixture just a little over a liter actually
Return to Joshua in the crater Pour the bottle of diluted gasoline into the motorbike rsquo s tank
Go to Joshua who explains how to find the combination to open the dimensional door NOTE This is the old old game puzzle which once used to be called lsquo Bulls and Cows rsquo
There are buttons You have to press the correct and also press them in the correct order hellip you can rsquo t use any button more than once Each button has a musical note associated with it which appears in the dialog instruction taskbar below the game The notes run from ldquo A rdquo thro rsquo ldquo F rdquo together with the instructions ldquo Note already pressed rdquo and ldquo Leave the panel rdquo
Also each button note has an associated colored panel Joshua will tell you how many you pressed were correct ones and how many were both correct AND in the correct position
It is a nice game puzzle and not too difficult since you are allowed as many attempts as you like need But you really need to list your tries and their results and work logically You will quite likely have to make quite a number of attempts If however you are REALLY stuck the order of the notes is ldquo C rdquo ldquo G rdquo ldquo E rdquo ldquo B rdquo ldquo A rdquo and the colors are hellip orange yellow mauve pink violet
When you succeed in getting the exact correct combination there is a strange noise and an intense beam of light from the sky down into the center of the crater You see Joshua getting beamed up to join his Trantorians hellip or whatever wherever Brian walks down into the center of the crater to have a look around
Brian ldquo Oh Well hellip I don rsquo t think we rsquo ll be seeing Joshua again rdquo The only thing he has left behind is a black mark in the center of the crater and his blue telepathic helmet Pick up the helmet
Walk up from the crater to Joshua rsquo s camping tent which you couldn rsquo t enter previously From the tent take a flashlight you can attach to your head and a climbing rope
Return to the map and go to the abandoned mine Look at the enormous boulder which blocks the mine entrance Move it there rsquo s a small crack in the entrance hellip impossible it rsquo s much too heavy
Peer into the hole that Gina fell into hellip the ladders broken so nothing can be done there
Below a huge rock and a wheelbarrow middle left edge of the screen is an empty oil can Pick it up
Return to Douglasville and go to Saturn Again talk to him hellip lsquo You see ldquo mon ami rdquo there rsquo s something I wanted to ask you hellip rsquo Then ask him how he moves the enormous heavy rocks he uses for his sculptures hellip a crane No Apparently Oscar moves them for him and he repays Oscar with menthol chewing tobacco
Saturn needs inspiration and brilliant ideas Give Saturn Joshua rsquo s telepathic helmet He puts it on his head and it seems to be the answer to his crisis He leaves his workshop to look for suitable stones
Whilst he rsquo s out of the way pick up his blow torch
Fill up your oil can with water from the green colored gallon water machine
Go downstairs and into the gardening shed again Now you find some tobacco leaves
Go out and walkto the end of the street past the bank and to the right of it Examine the ancient locomotive lying on its side
Pour the water from your oilcan into the locomotive rsquo s water tank
Return to the water machine in the upper floor of the saloon and again fill up your oil can with water from the water machine
You have to repeat and another times until the locomotive rsquo s water tank is full i e
FIVE times altogether If you do it less you won rsquo t progress hellip if you try it a sixth time it will tell you that the tank rsquo s full
To the left of the locomotive is the reddish colored driver rsquo s cab Jump up and into the cab Look around at the levers and gauges etc there
Look at the empty boiler Pop your logs of wood in
Light up the boiler using your blow torch
There is a wheel with a handle in the cab turn it once only hellip enough pressure
There are a couple of levers Pull the one just above the gauges on the right hellip releases steam
This causes the smokestack to eject a blast of steam under pressure Together with the steam emerges a key not too easy to see on the ground
Pick up the key from the ground in front of the smokestack andveryclose to the yellowish colored plant
Go back to the Sheriff rsquo s office and use the key to open the cell ignoring the nauseating smell
Open the dead man rsquo s briefcase on the floor and take the liniment
Exit the cell and the sheriff rsquo s office Go to Mama Dorita rsquo s and ask Oscar to help you i e
to move the rock at the entrance to the abandoned mine But he won rsquo t
In inventory make a mortar and pestle using your clay vessel and bank stamp and fill with liniment and tobacco leaves you need to lsquo play around with rsquo ALL of these items
Manufacture someersatzmenthol chewing tobacco
Give the lsquo tobacco rsquo to Oscar to entice him to help you
Ask Oscar again for help He accompanies Brian and easily moves the huge rock from the entrance to the abandoned mine
Go to the bank and look at the can of paint which you launched earlier with the catapult
Yet again return to the upper floor of the saloon Now that Saturn rsquo s out of the way press the red buttons which control the crane This causes the heavy statue to be moved onto the catapult
Use the catapult lever and the heavy statue goes flying into the bank on top of the red paint Go to the bank There is now a huge hole there leading to the basement hellip go there
Look at the safe and try to open it You should try but you can rsquo t without the combination
NOTE This step is helpful but not essential
Return to Sushi and talk to her When you ask her she will give you some minor hints as to the safe rsquo s combination Unfortunately this in itself is insufficient
Again return to the sheriff rsquo s office and enter the cell Look in the briefcase again This time you find a stethoscope N B
You may have obtained this earlier
Again back to the bank Place the stethoscope onto the safe
Turn the knob SLOWLY first to the right and then to the left and then to the right again Listen to the tumbler clicks and you get the combination You can rsquo t go wrong here hellip the dial stops automatically and the combination number revealed for each correct position it rsquo s NOT a puzzle
The combination is hellip hellip right left right
This opens the safe Get the map of the abandoned mine
You are now at last able to enter the mine hellip providing that a the rock no longer blocks the entrance b you have the head flashlight and the rope and c you have obtained the mine map
Go in and you are in a cutscene which takes you to chapter
GIFTS FROM THE CRYPT Brian goes spelunking through the mine shaft and despite the ghastly bats emerges into the sunlight He teeters on the edge of a cliff with the Hopi village down below It rsquo s impossible to just climb down hellip the cliff is much too steep
On the ground and close to the entrance and exit of the mine is a long piece of wood hellip Take it
Beneath that piece of wood is a metal object It is the head of a miner rsquo s tool hellip without a handle
There rsquo s a miner rsquo s skeleton at the entrance to the cave Grab a bone hellip Grave robbing It rsquo s a human femur
In inventory combine the femur with the head of the mining tool and get a hammer with nail remover
In the wooden left hand cross strut of the cave entrance is a somewhat rickety nail Remove the nail with your makeshift hammer
Insert the nail into the hard ground using your hammer at the cliff rsquo s edge hellip where you first stopped after exiting the cave Tie your climbing rope onto this nail and climb down to the level of the Hopi village
Surprise surprise A happy reunion with Gina hellip alive and well except for a broken leg They exchange some past experiences
They decide that Brian should first see what can be done in the Hopi village by himself and then return and see to Gina He sets off to the left edge of the screen and almost immediately turns left again into the unexplored area He treks towards a cliff over a rickety suspension bridge until he reaches the entrance to the crypt hellip which is what he rsquo s been looking for NOTE The moving figure of Brian is very tiny on this broad panoramic scenery
He confronts a monolith in the shape of a Hopi deity which looks rather like it rsquo s guarding the opening It rsquo s mouth looks like a keyhole
Place your crucifix key into the mouth of the monolith Ha No it all seemed too easy hellip the mouth is full of desert sand and the key won rsquo t fit in
Look at the plant to the left of the monolith The stem has pods growing on it like green beans
Break off a branch of this unknown plant
Use the branch to clean out the mouth of the monolith
Insert the crucifix key again
This time it works fine The monolith moves aside revealing the entrance to a cave
Enter the cave and watch the cut scene in which Wupuchim gives Brian more advice and a closed bottle The bottle is filled with formaldehyde in which floats a human finger hellip
Ugh
Brian exits the cave and returns to the path leading back
Make for the Hopi village near to the top left corner of your screen
You will reach the village facing towards Gina
Return to her and continue almost in the same direction to the huge ominous statue which seems to be guarding a cave
Enter the cave you can rsquo t go far and face the front of the statue To the right of the statue is a Hopi symbol in the shape of a cross In front of that is a stone against which is leaning an object not too easy to discern
Pick up the object It is a special Indian tomahawk which can be used as an axe or a peace
pipe
Return to Gina and continue as far as you can in a straight line don rsquo t turn left as you did previously On Brian rsquo s right is a ground level door hellip get him to turn towards it Enter the door and Brian rather small emerges from a door a floor above
Get Brian to turn to his left walk past a ladder and enter the adjacent door This brings him out of a door high up in the building NOTE The figure of Brian is extremely small and unclear
Make Brian turn to his right pass a door and then a ladder and enter the door after that the last one in that row
He pops out again from a door high up in the building to the right of the one he entered He is standing next to a ladder and a little to the right of that is another door hellip enter it
Brian walks along to the right and stops immediately behind the mauve colored climbing rope
Use your tomahawk to cut the rope as high off the ground as you can Grab the cut off length of rope
Return to Gina You need to make splints for her broken leg
In inventory use your tomahawk again to split your long piece of wood into two to make a pair of splints for Gina rsquo s broken leg
Puteitherthe ropeorthe pair of small pieces of wood onto Gina You need them both to apply the splints and tie them in place
There is now a cutscene where Brian and Gina make their way through the mine tunnel and back to Douglasville They finish up consulting Mama Dorita back on the map and near to Douglasville
THE INDIAN THE NUN AND THE FINGER NOTE Quite a large part of this last chapter is taken up with cutscenes some of them quite lengthy I shall try to avoid anything except vital info so as not to spoil the twists and turns of the surprising narrative
Brian says to Mama Dorita ldquo I need to speak with a dead person rdquo Exhaust all the dialogs on this subject
It seems a medium has to be found Brian volunteers but apparently he would ldquo need to lower his level of consciousness rdquo
Ask to speak to Gina Go through all dialogs with her
Leave and return to Douglasville Enter the Hotel For the first time Sushi asks you to join her upstairs Brian tells her the whole story to date
Sushi is surrounded by tons of extremely sophisticated hi tech apparatus It turns out that she is one of the many top class female hackers not the insidious virus spreading breed
She can do almost anything with computers Talk with her and go throughalltopics of conversation NOTE For the first time you can now browse around inside the hotel both downstairs and upstairs
Leave the hotel and enter the saloon Meet Rutger at last playing on his bongo drums Talk to him about everything possible In particular quiz him on the existence of a plant or something like that to put Brian into a trance or as Rutger expresses it ldquo hellip to trip out rdquo
Give him barter again your fine Hopi axe pipe and he prepares a puff of his presumably narcotic concoction This automatically takes Brian to Mama Dorita His level of consciousness has been lowered by this but not sufficiently
Return to Rutger hellip ldquo That stuff you put in the pipe didn rsquo t work hellip I need something stronger rdquo Brian shakes the branch he found at the Hopi village and pods are obtained in inventory These must be pods of the lsquo yawaskel rsquo that Rutger said the Indian medicine men and Shaman talked about
Try to open the pods in order to get the famous little lumpy red balls which are needed You can rsquo t hellip the shells are too hard to open manually
Exit and go into the cell in the sheriff rsquo s office Open the corpse rsquo s briefcase yet again for the THIRD successful time
and lo and behold you get a scalpel
In inventory use the scalpel to open the pods and obtain the little lsquo yawaskel rsquo balls No luck
hellip the pods are too hard and the scalpel too dull
Exit the cell and the sheriff rsquo s and enter Sushi rsquo s hellip ground floor
Heat the scalpel in the fireplace the fire is lit and be careful you don rsquo t get burnt
The scalpel is red hot and so now cuts the pods open no matter how hard they are
Next to the fireplace is a rather sooty poker hellip take it with you
Return to Rutger in the saloon and give him the lsquo yawaskel rsquo balls
This sparks off a very long cutscene involving a s ancewhich unveils REALLYsensational revelations
Return to Douglasville You automatically enter the hotel and talk with Sushi and tell her the full true story She recommends asking Rutger or Saturn if they rsquo ve seen a trailer around
Go to the saloon Rurger doesn rsquo t remember seeing a trailer Go upstairs and ask Saturn about a trailer He saw an old abandoned one several months back and gives some general directions
Go to the map A new location has appeared top left hand corner of the map hellip Path to Johnny rsquo s trailer
Go onto this path and continue until you see the trailer
Open the door No luck hellip it rsquo s locked up tight
Lever the door open with your poker
Have a good look around inside How weird hellip a nun rsquo s habit
Immediately after leaving the trailer look at the tray on the inside of the open door
The tray is full of papers Rummage through them and find an advertisement for the Mojave Bank
Return to Sushi in Douglasville Talk to her about the trailer and give her the bank brochure
Ask her if she can hack out any info on the bank on her computers hellip Sure thing in a short while
Exit the hotel go onto the map and immediately return to Sushi She has aLOADof vital information for Brian
Exit the hotel and return to Johnny rsquo s trailer Nab the nun rsquo s habit
Exit the trailer Brian hears a car in the distance and hides The two dumb goons Gustav and Feodor enter the trailer and wait for Gina amp or Brian to turn up there Brian quietly returns to Douglasville
Enter the hotel and talk to Sushi again It rsquo s essential to think up a good plan hellip to save EVERYBODY
Leave the hotel again and enter the derailed locomotive rsquo s drivers cab
Repeat thro rsquo except that this time a golden colored solid object is ejected in the same place Pick up the golden colored object It rsquo s a sheriff rsquo s badge
Go outside Mama Dorita rsquo s and present the badge to Oscar and swear him in as Sheriff Give Oscar his first assignment to bring Law amp Order to Douglasville A fairly long cutscene follows this
After talking to Sushi and sheriff Oscar go to the cell in the sheriff rsquo s office and gloat over the prisoners there
Look on the table at the jail bag of stuff belonging to the hoods and take it
Leave the sheriff rsquo s Return to the hotel and give the jail bag to Sushi hellip maybe she can somehow apply them for use on the Internet
Exit the hotel go onto the map and immediately return to Sushi and talk to her But she hasn rsquo t found anything of interest except that Gustav is a movie fan
Brian and Sushi both love movies and start discussing best Directors and their best films You can have some fun here and also waste some time until you hit on their mutual favorites hellip Woody Allen and ldquo Manhattan Murder Mystery rdquo This gives Sushi an idea After explaining all about it she gets Brian to take the crook rsquo s MP recorder
Leave the hotel and go to the cell again Record the hoods voices
Leave the sheriff rsquo s Go to Mama Dorita rsquo s again and rehearse Gina in reciting a very short lsquo speech rsquo After she rsquo s got it reasonably well record her
Return for the last time to Sushi and let her work on her voice emulation etc
programs
Return after an hour hellip hellip hellip
And hellip hellip hellip hellip hellip hellip hellip hellip hellip hellip T H E E N D of theinteractivegame There is an extremely long series of endgame cutscenes Don rsquo t turn off your computer when you get to the Credits or even the black screen with only music There rsquo s an IMPORTANT postscript to the story hellip and the promise of a sequel to the game which at the time of writing is apparently already in production
And so we say goodbye to Brian Gina the Sandretti rsquo s and everybody else hellip hellip for the time being anyhow

Runaway Demo Walkthrough by WinstonSmith Introduction Finding Professor Simon has become essential for Gina rsquo s survival
He lives in a remote part of Alaska not easily reached
A helpful chap carried us in his snow plough to within a few kilometres of Simon rsquo s home
After a good three hours rsquo walk through the snow Joshua had the bright idea of eating some unknown berries growing on a bush but they proved to be poisonous
At first he couldn rsquo t remember anything and then quickly he found himself unable to walk
In despair I put him on my back hoping to reach our destination before nightfall
Almost at the end of my strength I managed to reach a shack near a lake
Once inside I lit a fire hoping that the heat would help Joshua to recover
Unfortunately this was far from the case
I must quickly find a means of saving him or else I risk never seeing Gina alive again
Demo The demo opens in the shack Brian tries to reassure Joshua but he has no memory of you at all and is clearly delirious lsquo Go take a stroll on the beach the sea air will do you good rsquo
Not a good start
Brian comments that he saw a strange looking man in a fur coat on the hill taking photos of something hellip maybe he can help
Before you leave the shack though take the knife couteau from the cupboard to the left the hockey stick crosse de hockey beside the fireplace and if you rsquo re the sort who likes to take everything that rsquo s not nailed down there rsquo s also an oil can on mantelpiece burette d rsquo huile
I don rsquo t know about you but I worry about the sanity of anyone that keeps flammable liquids in close proximity to an open fire but never mind
You can talk to Joshua again if you want but there rsquo s nothing to gain by it really
Option has you trying to unsuccessfully convince Joshua that he knows you option has you pretending to be the voice of his conscience chastising him for eating the berries apparently this isn rsquo t the first time he rsquo s heard the voice of his conscience either
and option has you pretending to be the director of NASA trying to recruit him for the first manned flight to Pluto hellip Brian seems to have developed a bit of a mean streak along with the new look it seems
There isn rsquo t much else to see in the shack there is a presumably slops bucket on the far left seau which Brian refuses to even go near and a bottle of alcohol that Brian suspects has probably turned to vinegar by now anyway
Nothing to do now but brace ourselves and go back out into the snow hellip Outside make sure to take the bottle of bleach bouteille to the left of the door and the chainsaw tron onneuse on the woodpile to its right
Brian will make a smart alecky remark about the size of the chainsaw in comparison to his pockets but reluctantly acquiesce hellip hey
And it works
While you rsquo re here go take a look at the pickup to the right as well
Ooh
A plastic elk hellip very tasteful
There rsquo s nothing for it but to climb up to the summit
Follow the path at the foot of the screen lsquo I shall see if I can find the man I saw earlier hellip rsquo
A conversation immediately follows
The man introduces himself as Ben Wazowski and apparently knows the berries all too well they are a favourite of the bears that he is studying but causes the same symptoms in them too
Fortunately there is a cure hellip raw salmon
Yum
Incidentally it appears that Ben lost his fishing rod in an unfortunate accident with a young bear the previous week
What are the chances eh
When you getthe chance select option lsquo Great costume rsquo
He really doesn rsquo t like you calling it a costume lsquo hellip It doesn rsquo t sound serious
It rsquo s more of a bear suit but it isn rsquo t finished yet rsquo then choose option lsquo Ah yes hellip now that you mention it hellip the only place I rsquo ve ever seen bears with glasses before is in fairy stories hellip rsquo
Apparently Ben ordered a bear suit and hasmanufactured an assortment of bear lsquo perfumes rsquo so that he can commune with the bearsto prove a pet theory of his which he seems reluctant to disclose but clearly involves the real reason bears scratch their backs on tree trunks
Unfortunately it came without a head and Ben knows that to approach the bears like this means certain death
Select option and then option to conclude the conversation with Ben inviting you both to have dinner with him that evening if you rsquo re still about
While you rsquo re here you may as well note the bear claw gloves pattes d rsquo our on the rucksack behind him and the two flasks flacons in the pockets on its left and right hand sides
When you rsquo re ready go left to the frozen river
Time to play Eskimo but how are you going to make a hole in the ice
Yup you guessed it the chainsaw faire un trou dans la glace
Uh oh
This bear has taken a shine to your fishing hole and doesn rsquo t want to share
Brian is reluctant to throw anything at it lest he incur the wrath of Greenpeace and a stern rebuke doesn rsquo t cut it so it looks as if a retreat is in order hellip Maybe Ben can be persuaded to go and distract the bear
Of course you rsquo ll need to complete his bear suit first but where are you going to find a suitable head
Remember the plastic elk by the old shack
Time for a little wanton destruction return to the shack and use the chainsaw on it d capiter lan avec tron onneuse
Brian immediately removes its antlers to make it a little more bear like
Apparently
It doesn rsquo t exactly match the rest of the outfit though does it
If only you had something to turn it white hellip like bleach
Use the bottle on the head hellip much better
Return to Ben and present him with your rather unlikely looking bear head
Hmmm hellip Brian could pass it off as a bear head but as soon as he put it on Ben would no longer be able to see
Better give it some eye holes I guess
Use knife on head
Now give the head to Ben and he will venture off with some trepidation and a little eau de ferocious bear to make contact with your furry friend
While he rsquo s gone remove the flask flacon from the left pocket of the backpack and swap it for the one on the right
After about a minute he comes back looking rather dejected
The experiment wasn rsquo t entirely successful it seems lsquo If I rsquo d gone any closer I rsquo d have been torn to shreds rsquo
Oh dear
Ah well second time lucky hellip select option then option lsquo he saw you standing up and thought you were attacking perhaps if you went on all fours rsquo option lsquo you can rsquo t give up when you rsquo re so close rsquo or option lsquo he rsquo d just caught a fish and thought you were going to steal it he rsquo ll have calmed down by now rsquo to persuade him to have another go lsquo something tells me Ben will have more success this time hellip rsquo
After a cut scene where mercifully we can rsquo t see what rsquo s happening the bear and Ben have disappeared into the woods
Return to the river
It looks as though Ben has dropped a glove patte d rsquo ours on the ice but it rsquo s too far out to reach and Brian has no desire to walk out to it in case he falls through
If only your arms were longer hellip or you had something to hook it with
Use hockey stick on glove
Remember how the bear fished for salmon
Time to give it a try yourself hellip except that Brian has no wish to put his hand in icy water gloved or not
Perhaps you can hook them out with something else in your inventory
Use the hockey stick with the hole in the ice p cher avec crosse de hockey
Not bad but you can rsquo t get a grip on the slippery little so and sos
Have you anything that would help
Use glove with hockey stick lsquo yes
That makes a great bear paw rsquo and go hook yourself a salmon
You will automatically pick it up and take it back to Joshua to trigger a final cut scene
Oh dear

The pirates tore the treasure map they found in and each got one ensuring their cooperation
The last Caribbean Express was to pass Chickpea Island days later
They have days to get to that port
The problem was that during the brawl they lost of their wooden legs
They decided they would return to the port in pairs with one pirate wearing the sole remaining peg leg and the other leaning upon him
